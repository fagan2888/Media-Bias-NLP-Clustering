The tax has not been increased since 1993, however, and improvements in auto fuel efficiency have sapped its purchasing power.\n\nThe federal government typically spends about $50 billion per year on transportation projects, but the gas tax only brings in approximately $34 billion annually at its current rate.\n\nLawmakers have turned to other areas of the federal budget in recent years to close the $16 billion per year gap, but transportation advocates have said the resulting temporary funding measures are preventing states from completing large construction projects.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The state is the latest to look to increase its own transportation funding.", "description": "The state is the latest to look to increase its own transportation funding.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Keith Laing", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The state is the latest to look to increase its own transportation funding.", "title": "Calif. considering 10-cent gas tax hike", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/243948-calif-considering-10-cent-gas-tax-hike", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/gasprices10152014getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:39-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/243948-calif-considering-10-cent-gas-tax-hike", "dcterms.date": "2015-06-03T17:26-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Keith Laing", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Gas Tax, Highway bill, Highway Trust Fund, MAP-21 Reauthorization,,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-03T17:26:53-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/243948-calif-considering-10-cent-gas-tax-hike", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The state is the latest to look to increase its own transportation funding.", "card": "summary", "title": "Calif. considering 10-cent gas tax hike"}, "dcterms.title": "Calif. considering 10-cent gas tax hike"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe23e7\"", "article_summary": "The national gas tax has been the traditional source of transportation funding since its inception in the 1930s.\nThe state is the latest to consider increasing its gas tax in recent years as federal transportation funding has dried up.\nLegislation has been in introduced in the California state Senate that would increase the state\u2019s approximately 42 cents-per-gallon gas tax by 10 cents.\nThe federal government typically spends about $50 billion per year on transportation projects, but the gas tax only brings in approximately $34 billion annually at its current rate.\nADVERTISEMENTThe American Petroleum Institute says the gas tax increase will bring the total amount of money that drivers in California are charged at the pump to more than 72 cents per gallon."}
