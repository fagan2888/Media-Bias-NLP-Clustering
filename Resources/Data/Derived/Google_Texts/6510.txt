A Christian group wants you to shop based on your beliefs this holiday season, and they've created a guide to make it simple.

A group that goes by the self-explanatory name "Faith Driven Consumer" has just rated a huge swath of the nation's top brands on a 100 point Faith Equality Index.

Essentially they attempted to gauge the degree to which biblical faith guides the philosophy of companies based on factors such as "compatibility with a comprehensive pro-life view on abortion," the use of the word "Christmas" in holiday advertising and publicly stated protections for religious customers and employees, among other factors. (See the complete scorecard here.)

Backers of the campaign -- which they are calling a "buycott" -- ask that devotees of the Bible shift their shopping habits toward companies that score well on their scale.

"Just in time for the busy Christmas shopping season—we launched our ground-breaking new scoring system rating major brands on their relative faith-compatibility," states the campaign. "As a rapidly emerging and economically powerful movement with a legitimate voice in the public square, Faith Driven Consumers comprise 17 percent of the population – 41 million Americans – and spend $2 trillion annually."

Organizers point out that not one company earned so much as a 65 on the scale.

"The FEI establishes a benchmark—a starting point—that brands can improve upon," states the campaign.

Politicos will note that executives at the highest scoring companies have made headlines for opposing same sex marriage (Chick-fil-A) and Obamacare contraceptive distribution (Hobby Lobby), among other polarizing causes. At the other end of the scale, Apple and others were dinged for not specifically reaching out to religious consumers.

The campaign is operating on social media under the hashtag #AddUsIn, referencing the desire for corporations to include Christians as a "protected class" of American citizens.

"It's important for everyone to understand what we are asking Corporate America to do—acknowledge us on equal footing with the other groups they embrace and celebrate," writes the campaign.

The highest and lowest scoring corporations are listed in the slideshow above to do with as you will.

The complete ratings are broken out by industry here.

So, if you identify as a Christian it may be time to mentally prepare to find a car battery or hunk of cheese under your Christmas tree.
