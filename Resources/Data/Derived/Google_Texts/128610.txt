Amy Duggar's husband Dillon King has been sued for $51,000 in unpaid medical bills.

An image appeared on a Facebook page showing the lawsuit filed against King by NW AR Hospitals. The accompanying text explains King's expense may pertain to a car accident he was in last year. The word got out when an Arkansas newspaper printed a public notice.

"Looks like there is another lawsuit concerning the Duggars going on. Amy Duggar's husband is being sued by NW Arkansas hospitals," the tongue-in-cheek post reads.

"Dillon was in a bad car accident last year and as a self-employed young man I guess he simply forgot to get himself some Obamacare. With a new (used) home, buying Amy a new car and some expensive vacations this past year, I'm sure he'll eventually get around to paying his hospital bill."

According to Radar Online, King was in a head-on collision that resulted in a broke femur. He reportedly needed extensive hospital care for three days which may have warranted the big hospital expenditure.

The hospital reportedly asked for payment several times but did not receive any. Besides the hospital bills, the Dillons will also have to fork out attorney costs and interest for payment default the hospital is demanding.

Debt is frowned up on in the conservative Duggar family that prefers paying for what it buys. Jim Bob however made news when it was revealed that he had $ 14,000 in debt including unpaid medical bills.

Inquisitr also reported that Josh Duggar was in the middle of a $ 500,000 lawsuit last year when a porn actor alleged sex with him was like rape though it was consensual. The lawsuit did not stand legal scrutiny as Duggar was able to prove he was not with the actor on the dates she claimed they had sex.
