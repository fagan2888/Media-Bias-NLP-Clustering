Covered California, the state\u2019s insurance exchange, enrolled more people in private healthcare plans during the first month of open enrollment than any other state health exchange or the beleaguered federal marketplace, which serves 36 states.\n\nMs. Harris\u2019s announcement on Wednesday was the latest example of state officials in California, where Democrats hold all statewide offices, enthusiastically pushing Californians to buy healthcare plans on the state\u2019s exchange.\n\n\u201cI urge Californians to avoid healthcare scams by visiting coveredca.com,\u201d Ms. Harris said.\n\nThe attorney general\u2019s office began investigating websites that imitated Covered California in September.\n\nThe sites all used domain names similar to coveredca.com, including coveredcalifornia.com and californiabenefitexchange.com, and they used phrases like \u201cGet Covered\u201d and \u201cCovered California\u201d to attract consumers, according to the attorney general\u2019s office. However, the sites were operated by private health insurance brokers not affiliated with the state\u2019s official exchange.\n\nThe California Affordable Care Act prohibits entities from claiming to provide services on behalf of Covered California without a valid agreement with the state exchange. Multiple website operators were sent cease and desist orders, demanding they either shut the sites down, or redirect traffic to the official Covered California website, and ten operators have now been shut down, according to the attorney general\u2019s office.\n\nIn urging residents to visit the state exchange, Ms. Harris warned that health insurance plans sold outside the official exchange before Jan. 1, 2014, would not qualify for federal subsidies, and would not have the consumer protections guaranteed under the Affordable Care Act.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20131114173833, "BN": "affordable-care-act", "DISPLAYDATE": "November 14, 2013", "keywords": "Exchanges", "GBLC": "Exchanges", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Ian Lovett", "SCG": "affordable-care-act", "sourceApp": "blogs", "CLMST": "Ian Lovett", "byl": "Ian Lovett", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/news/affordable-care-act/2013/11/14/california-shuts-down-sites-mimicking-state-insurance-marketplace/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "description": "The California attorney general\u2019s office has shut down 10 websites that mimicked state\u2019s official health insurance marketplace.", "card": "summary", "title": "California Shuts Down Sites Mimicking State Insurance Marketplace"}, "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/affordable-care-act/post", "description": "The California attorney general\u2019s office has shut down 10 websites that mimicked state\u2019s official health insurance marketplace.", "CG": "U.S.", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "November 14, 2013", "article": {"section": "U.S.", "tag": "Exchanges", "published_time": 1384468713, "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "modified_time": "2013-11-15T04:15:56-05:00"}, "utime": 20131115041556, "PUD": 20131114, "pdate": 20131114, "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "In Practice", "description": "The California attorney general\u2019s office has shut down 10 websites that mimicked state\u2019s official health insurance marketplace.", "title": "California Shuts Down Sites Mimicking State Insurance Marketplace", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/news/affordable-care-act/2013/11/14/california-shuts-down-sites-mimicking-state-insurance-marketplace/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v3/../../packages/images/nytdesign/2013/national/inPractice/inPractice-75.png", "type": "article"}, "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "California Shuts Down Sites Mimicking State Insurance Marketplace", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd4c7\"", "article_summary": "However, the sites were operated by private health insurance brokers not affiliated with the state\u2019s official exchange.\nThe California Affordable Care Act prohibits entities from claiming to provide services on behalf of Covered California without a valid agreement with the state exchange.\nLOS ANGELES\u2014The California attorney general\u2019s office has shut down 10 websites that mimicked state\u2019s official health insurance marketplace, the attorney general, Kamala Harris, announced Wednesday.\nCovered California, the state\u2019s insurance exchange, enrolled more people in private healthcare plans during the first month of open enrollment than any other state health exchange or the beleaguered federal marketplace, which serves 36 states.\nThe attorney general\u2019s office began investigating websites that imitated Covered California in September."}
