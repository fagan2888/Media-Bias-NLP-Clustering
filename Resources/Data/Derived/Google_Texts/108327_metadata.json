But Wichita's recent vote to reduce some marijuana sentences does not.\n\nThe Kansas Speaks survey conducted by Fort Hays State University reveals 75 percent of Kansans oppose the \"constitutional carry\" law signed by Governor Brownback. Starting in July, people will not need a permit or a training course to carry a concealed weapon.\n\n\"This is kind of a solution in search of a problem,\" Dr. Chapman Rackaway of FHSU's Docking Institute of Public Affairs told KAKE's This Week in Kansas. \"Clearly, the voters in Kansas and the respondents in the Kansas Speaks poll have said, this is not something that there's an overwhelming demand for from the public. In fact, there's a mandate going the other way.\"\n\nIt was conducted in late march by researchers at Fort Hays State.\n\nThe survey also reveals 63 percent of Kansans want the penalty for marijuana possession reduced, similar to what Wichita voters approved in early April.\n\nBy comparison, the Kansas Speaks 2014 poll showed only 42 percent of Kansans supported \"decriminalizing the recreational possession and consumption\" of pot.\n\nThe latest survey also shows 68 percent of Kansans think medical marijuana should become legal by prescription. That's up from 59 percent a year ago.\n\nOn other topics, 56 percent of Kansans said they opposed fracking for oil. And 58 percent say they support expanding Medicare eligibility under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe poll was conducted in late March and April 1, before the local general elections. The survey has a sampling error of 4.4 percent.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Support rises statewide for medicinal marijuana, as well as reducing pot possession to a fine.", "language": "english", "author": "KAKE.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Poll-Kansans-oppose-new-state-gun-law-301410461.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/560*315/Kansas-state-logo.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Support rises statewide for medicinal marijuana, as well as reducing pot possession to a fine.", "title": "Poll: Kansans oppose new state gun law"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "Support rises statewide for medicinal marijuana, as well as reducing pot possession to a fine.", "title": "Poll: Kansans oppose new state gun law", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Poll-Kansans-oppose-new-state-gun-law-301410461.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/Kansas-state-logo.jpg", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "keywords": "Poll: Kansans oppose new state gun law", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Poll Kansans oppose new state"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0f15\"", "article_summary": "The Kansas Speaks survey conducted by Fort Hays State University reveals 75 percent of Kansans oppose the \"constitutional carry\" law signed by Governor Brownback.\nBy comparison, the Kansas Speaks 2014 poll showed only 42 percent of Kansans supported \"decriminalizing the recreational possession and consumption\" of pot.\nA new state law loosening the rules for carrying weapons has a lot of opposition IN a new poll.\n\"Clearly, the voters in Kansas and the respondents in the Kansas Speaks poll have said, this is not something that there's an overwhelming demand for from the public.\nThe latest survey also shows 68 percent of Kansans think medical marijuana should become legal by prescription."}
