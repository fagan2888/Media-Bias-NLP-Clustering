She was crowned Saturday, August 29, during a leadership competition at Cornerstone Fellowship Church in Tahlequah.\n\nPittman receives a $3,000 scholarship and for the next year will represent the Cherokee Nation as a goodwill ambassador to promote the government, history, language and culture of the Cherokee people.\n\n\u201cServing as Miss Cherokee is a life-changing experience. It\u2019s an opportunity to travel across Oklahoma and the United States representing the tribe, and visit with Cherokees of all ages and all walks of life,\u201d Principal Chief Bill John Baker said in a press release. \u201cMiss Cherokee is truly an asset to the Cherokee Nation and an extremely important role model who exemplifies the best qualities of Cherokee youth.\u201d\n\nPittman is the daughter of Pete and Ginny Pittman. She competed against three other young women for the crown. The Miss Cherokee Leadership Competition judged contestants on their use of the Cherokee language, cultural and platform presentations, and impromptu interviews.\n\n\u201cBeing Miss Cherokee is nothing to take lightly. It\u2019s such a high honor and means I need to continue to be a good role model and do the best I can to represent the tribe,\u201d Pittman said. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect it and hated to cry, because when Chief Baker hugged me I soaked his shirt a little.\u201d\n\nPittman, of Tahlequah, is studying psychology with a minor in chemistry. She wants to pursue a career as a psychiatrist. She is currently the vice president of the Cherokee Nation Tribal Youth Council and former secretary of Native American Students Association. She also volunteers on mission trips each summer with her church and was an intern with Baptist Collegiate Ministry at NSU.\n\nFor her cultural presentation, Pittman composed a piano piece and sang Orphan Child in Cherokee. Her mother is bilingual and grew up in Nicut with Cherokee as her first language. Pittman\u2019s platform tackled youth needing strong mentors in school.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to use my platform to speak to students in rural schools about overcoming some of the issues they face, and I can\u2019t think of a better way to serve my tribe,\u201d she said.\n\nPittman\u2019s first public event as Miss Cherokee will be Saturday\u2019s State of the Nation Address at the 63rd Cherokee National Holiday in Tahlequah.\n\nMiss Cherokee first runner-up was Jackie Eagle, of Gore, who earned a $2,000 scholarship. Second runner-up was Brooke Bailey, of Hulbert, who earned a $1,000 scholarship.\n\nJudges for the Miss Cherokee Leadership Competition were Brenda Krouse Fitzgerald, Dana Hummingbird Noel, Rebecca Carey-Drywater and Cherokee artist Demos Glass, who designed this year\u2019s crown.\n\nPast Miss Cherokees have met with President Barack Obama, attended a White House Generation Indigenous Initiative for Native Youth, spoke at the Smithsonian\u2019s National Museum of the American Indian and attended many events hosted by the tribe.\n\nOne week prior, the Junior Miss Cherokee crown was passed to Madison Whitekiller, Verdigris High School junior of Claremore, Oklahoma.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhitekiller was bestowed the honor at the 24th Annual Junior Miss Cherokee Competition, held Saturday, August 22.\n\nFor the next year, Whitekiller will act as a goodwill ambassador for the tribe, promoting the government, language, history and traditions of the Cherokee people, states a Cherokee Nation press release.\n\nFive teens competed to serve as the 2015-16 Junior Miss Cherokee at the Tahlequah Armory Municipal Center in three categories: cultural presentation, impromptu question and a speech on their platform.\n\nWhitekiller, 16, earned her sash and crown after she presented the history of the Cherokee syllabary, answered what one thing she would do for the Cherokee people and gave a speech on the importance of reading.\n\n\u201cBeing crowned Junior Miss Cherokee means so much to me, because I worked so hard months ahead of time to get where I am now,\u201d Whitekiller said. \u201cI\u2019m just ready to get out in the communities and meet all the great Cherokee people, and be able to educate those who aren\u2019t Cherokee about our culture and history.\u201d\n\nDuring her reign as Junior Miss Cherokee, Whitekiller hopes to visit schools throughout the tribe\u2019s jurisdiction to promote the importance of reading. In addition to the crown, Whitekiller also received the cultural presentation, traditional dress and Miss Congeniality awards. Whitekiller is the daughter of Suzy Whitekiller.\n\nElizabeth Hummingbird, 17, of Stilwell, was named first runner-up, with Danya Pigeon, 15, of Tahlequah, named second runner-up.
