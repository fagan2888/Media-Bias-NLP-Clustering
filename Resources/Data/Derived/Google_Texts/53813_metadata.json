But their claims of efficacy have no more scientific support than does the Flintstones account of early human history.\n\nBegin with acupuncture. The theory of acupuncture is that health problems arise from inhibitions of the body\u2019s vital energy, known as qi, which can be relieved by applying needles to specific points in the body. Qi, so far as science can document, does not exist, and the anatomical points associated with traditional acupunctural therapy are, so far as science can document, of no special importance. This might lead one to conclude that it does not really much matter where an acupuncturist sticks the needles, which turns out to be exactly the case. This has been shown by comparing the results from \u201creal\u201d acupuncture treatments to \u201csham\u201d acupuncture treatments, in which patients think they are receiving traditional acupuncture but are not. As the New England Journal of Medicine acknowledges in a surprisingly sympathetic account of the subject: \u201cA meta-analysis in 2008, which involved a total of 6,359 patients, showed that real acupuncture treatments were no more effective than sham acupuncture treatments.\u201d\n\nThe American version of qi is \u201cinnate intelligence,\u201d which was discovered by magnetic healer Daniel David Palmer in the 19th century. Palmer founded the practice of chiropractic to help straighten out problems related to that innate intelligence. Like the practitioners of acupuncture, chiropractors work from the assumption that there are blockages of vitalistic energy. Never mind that this energy does not seem to actually exist, and that the blockages \u2014 \u201csubluxations\u201d \u2014 that they claim to detect are not detectable by conventional medical means such as X-ray examinations, we are assured that something real is going on here. It will not surprise you to learn that, like acupuncture, study after study after study has revealed that chiropractic confers no medical benefit but does involve some risk of injury. As the Journal of Pain and Symptom Management puts it: \u201cBack and neck pain are the domains of chiropractic but many chiropractors treat conditions other than musculoskeletal problems. With the possible exception of back pain, chiropractic spinal manipulation has not been shown to be effective for any medical condition. . . . The concepts of chiropractic are not based on solid science and its therapeutic value has not been demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt.\u201d\n\nThe problem is that credentialing in pseudoscientific sham fields such as naturopathic medicine has nothing to do with medical benefit. As Dr. Stephen Barrett notes in his report on naturopathy, the U.S. Department of Education recognizes an accrediting agency for schools of naturopathic medicine, but: \u201cAs with acupuncture and chiropractic schools, this recognition was not based upon the scientific validity of what is taught but on such factors as record-keeping, physical assets, financial status, makeup of the governing body, catalog characteristics, nondiscrimination policy, and self-evaluation system.\u201d\n\nEducational accreditation leads to licensing, and licensing leads to eligibility for money under Obamacare. Senator Harkin\u2019s provision forbids \u201cdiscriminating\u201d against practitioners recognized in the states, and, unfortunately, we have some pretty fruity states: California, Connecticut, Vermont, Utah, and a dozen others recognize naturopathic medicine, in spite of its mystical claims and utter lack of scientific support. Recognition of chiropractic has become well nigh universal.\n\nIf we cannot discriminate against \u201cmedicine\u201d that \u201chas not been shown to be effective for any medical condition,\u201d what exactly can we discriminate against? Ask Senator Orrin Hatch (R., Utah). During the early stages of the health-care debate, Senator Hatch attempted to insert a provision into the law that would have put prayer therapy on the same footing as conventional medicine, with the support of John Kerry and Ted Kennedy. That failed because it was explicitly religious \u2014 as though qi and magnetic healing and chiropractic vitalism were less mystical than the Christian Science approach.\n\nBut anything with the word \u201cChristian\u201d attached to it spooks progressives. The issue for the Left isn\u2019t the scientific method and good evidence, but excluding Christians of whatever stripe from the public square. Unfortunately, Christians have given them an unneeded assist by embracing intelligent design and other schools of intellectual fraud.\n\nBut the next time you hear a chorus of \u201cHooray, science!\u201d from the Left, ask them why Barack Obama\u2019s signature health-care program is going to recognize the worst sort of quackery and pseudoscience, with no more regard for the scientific record than the most fervid young-Earth creationist, swami, or snake-handler.\n\n\u2014 Kevin D.
