The U.S. Senate has voted 52-47 to pass legislation which would repeal Obamacare and defund Planned Parenthood.

FoxNews.com reports that, though the bill has passed in the Senate and is expected to also pass in the House, President Obama has said he will veto it.

Nevertheless, many Senate and House Republicans see the passing of the bill as a precursor of what is to come should a Republican president be elected in 2016.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-KY stated, “President Obama will have a choice. He can defend a status quo that’s failed the middle class by vetoing the bill, or he can work toward a new beginning and better care by signing it.”

In addition to repealing Obamacare, the new bill would defund Planned Parenthood of the roughly $450 million the government budgets yearly for the organization.

“The Senate is right to recognize that taxpayer money should go to fund local community health centers, not to subsidize a scandal-ridden, billion-dollar abortion business. Americans shouldn’t be forced to give their money to Planned Parenthood, which has a long track record of abusive and potentially fraudulent billing practices, not to mention that it has also been caught in authenticated undercover videos trafficking aborted babies’ body parts and has repeatedly failed to report the sexual abuse of girls. That tax money should be redirected to trustworthy health care providers,” says Alliance Defending Freedom Legal Counsel Kellie Fiedorek (#DefundPP)

Democratic candidate and Independent Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders did not vote. Presidential candidates Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio voted “yes.” Moderate GOP Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Mark Kirk of Illinois voted no, the only lawmakers to cross party lines.
