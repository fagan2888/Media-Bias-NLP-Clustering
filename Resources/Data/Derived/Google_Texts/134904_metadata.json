Andrew Cuomo, new york state, Oil and Gas, Sustainability News, News, Politics News\n\nFracking took a beating yesterday, when New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, on the heels of a stern recommendation from the state\u2019s acting health commissioner, announced his intention to ban the unconventional drilling method.\n\nBut even if he\u2019d failed to do so, frackers would\u2019ve been effectively barred from a large number of the state\u2019s communities, anyway. That\u2019s because, during the excruciatingly long years that the state spent weighing the issue, a team of lawyers quietly helped individual towns use zoning ordinances to keep the industry out, regardless of what state and federal law says. When Salon spoke with one of those lawyers, Helen Slottje, in April, she and her husband, David, had successfully passed such laws in 172 towns. In June, the state\u2019s highest court affirmed their right to do so.\n\nNow that New York state has said it won\u2019t allow fracking within its borders, their fight\u2019s become redundant \u2014 at least so far as fracking goes. Speaking with Salon Wednesday night, Slottje was thrilled about the decision, but said that she\u2019s by no means ready to stop fighting. There are still a lot of other infrastructure projects to take on, after all: pipelines and gas storage facilities, for example, that are \u201cequally if not more devastating\u201d to communities. And they\u2019re already going national: \u201cThere are communities across the country that are looking to emulate New York\u2019s model of home rule and local control over gas drilling decisions,\u201d Slottje said, with an enthusiasm that has been building since the June Court of Appeals decision.\n\n\u201cI think with New York affirmatively taking a stand against fracking, that\u2019s going to empower and generate even more interest across the country,\u201d Slottje told Salon. \u201cEven in states where the state won\u2019t be as bold as what New York has done here, communities will feel that they\u2019re not out on a limb, that this isn\u2019t a radical decision.\u201d\n\nIn reaching his decision, Cuomo was adamant in saying that he deferred to the experts, who identified serious potential public health risks from fracking. The absurdly low current price of gas and oil probably didn\u2019t hurt, either. But it hasn\u2019t escaped anyone\u2019s notice how vocal and aggressive New York\u2019s fracking opposition has been. For years, the governor was \u201chounded by protesters\u201d everywhere he went; it\u2019s often cited as a reason why Zephyr Teachout,his anti-fracking opponent, was able to win a third of the vote in the primaries. Cuomo himself called protesters \u201cliterally the most prevalent protest group in the state by far.\u201d Wednesday, his very understated way of putting it was to say, \u201cI get very few people who say to me, \u2018I love the idea of fracking.\u2019\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "From here on out, one fractivist tells Salon, \"it'll be hard to get people to believe there's nothing they can do\"", "author": "Lindsay Abrams", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "From here on out, one fractivist tells Salon, \"it'll be hard to get people to believe there's nothing they can do\"", "title": "Why New York\u2019s fracking ban is a victory for communities everywhere", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/12/18/why_new_yorks_fracking_ban_is_a_victory_for_communities_everywhere/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/shutterstock_159181061.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "From here on out, one fractivist tells Salon, \"it'll be hard to get people to believe there's nothing they can do\"", "creator": "@readingirl", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/shutterstock_159181061.jpg", "title": "Why New York\u2019s fracking ban is a victory for communities everywhere", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Why New York\u2019s fracking ban is a victory for communities everywhere", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, anti-fracking, fracking, Gov.
