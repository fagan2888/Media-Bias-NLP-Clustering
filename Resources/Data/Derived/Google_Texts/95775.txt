The conservative activist group Citizens United is releasing a new poll of its membership, which surveyed some 4,000 activists across the country. Just two percent approve of the job Congress is doing. More than 90 percent want their Member of Congress to replace current House Speaker John Boehner.

“After four and a half years as Speaker, it’s become crystal clear that grassroots conservatives are through being patient with John Boehner,” David N. Bossie, president of Citizens United, said in a release. “Conservatives are clearly ready for new leadership in the U.S. House.”

The next scheduled vote for Speaker of the House will occur after the 2016 Presidential elections. Republicans are widely expected to maintain their majority in the House.

Republicans reclaimed the House majority after the 2010 midterms elections, largely on opposition to ObamaCare and a failed economic stimulus package.

Since Republicans took control of the House, the nation’s total debt burden has grown almost 40 percent, rising from around $13 trillion in 2010 to $18 trillion today.

The Citizens United poll surveyed Conservative grassroots activists on their views of Congress and Speaker Boehner’s leadership. Those surveyed reflect the views of the most political engaged conservatives around the country.

The complete lack of confidence in Speaker Boehner’s leadership is likely to translate into political headaches for Republican Congressmen in districts nationwide. Full survey results are available here.
