Kevin Hagen for The Wall Street Journal\n\nNew York Police Department Officer Rosa Rodriguez was released from Weill Cornell Medical Center Monday, more than a month after she was overcome by smoke while responding to a Coney Island fire with her partner, Dennis Guerra.\n\nOfficer Guerra was fatally injured in the blaze, the first officer killed in the line of duty since 2011.\n\nMore than 100 police officers outside the hospital applauded as Ms. Rodriguez emerged from the hospital in a wheelchair. She was accompanied by family members, as well as by Mayor Bill de Blasio and Police Commissioner William Bratton.\n\nShe became emotional as she was handed bouquets of flowers.\n\nOn April 6th, the officers responded to a mattress fire at 2007 Surf Avenue, taking an elevator to the 13th floor. When they elevator doors opened, the smoke overtook them.\n\nDr. Palmer Bessey, Associate Director of the Burn Center at the hospital, said Officer Rodriguez\u2019s primary injury was \u201cdestruction of lining of the lungs from the effects of toxic products in smoke.\u201d\n\nHe said that when first admitted, the officer had a 50% chance of dying. She was on a breathing machine for a month.\n\nAccording to Dr. Bessey, \u201cthere\u2019s a possibility she\u2019ll never be 100%.\u201d She said that Officer Rodriguez could eventually return to duty, but that \u201cissue is going to be what will it do to her own sort of confidence and ability to sort of not be a little bit afraid.\u201d\n\nA 16-year-old resident of the tower, Marcell Dockery, was charged with setting the fire and with Officer Guerra\u2019s death. He has pleaded not guilty to charges of murder in the second degree and first-degree assault.\n\nDeputy Inspector Carlos Valdez of PSA 1\u2014the precinct where both officers worked\u2014said Officer Rodriguez indicated am eagerness to rejoin the force.\n\n\u201cShe has talked to me about wanting to get back to work; she talked to me when she started coming around a couple weeks ago,\u201d Dep. Insp. Valdez said. \u201cI told her to take it easy\u2026you\u2019re entitled to a few months rest.\u201d\n\nEarlier Coverage:", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "NYPD Officer Rosa Rodriguez was released from Weill Cornell Medical Center Monday, more than a month she was overcome by smoke while responding to a Coney Island with her partner, Dennis Guerra.", "title": "Officer Injured in Coney Island Fire Released From Hospital", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2014/05/19/officer-injured-in-coney-island-fire-released-from-hospital/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-CV973_0519of_P_20140519142534.jpg"}, "site": "WSJNY", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "New York", "article.headline": "Officer Injured in Coney Island Fire Released From Hospital", "description": "NYPD Officer Rosa Rodriguez was released from Weill Cornell Medical Center Monday, more than a month she was overcome by smoke while responding to a Coney Island with her partner, Dennis Guerra.", "article_section": "New York", "author": "Adam Janos", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Metropolis Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Metropolis", "article.summary": "NYPD Officer Rosa Rodriguez was released from Weill Cornell Medical Center Monday, more than a month she was overcome by smoke while responding to a Coney Island with her partner, Dennis Guerra.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-05-19T20:35:38-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-157", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2014/05/19/officer-injured-in-coney-island-fire-released-from-hospital/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-METROB-20604", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "New York", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "NYPD Officer Rosa Rodriguez was released from Weill Cornell Medical Center Monday, more than a month she was overcome by smoke while responding to a Coney Island with her partner, Dennis Guerra.", "title": "Officer Injured in Coney Island Fire Released From Hospital", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2014/05/19/officer-injured-in-coney-island-fire-released-from-hospital/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-CV973_0519of_P_20140519142534.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Metropolis", "article.id": "BL-METROB-20604", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-05-20T13:47:07-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc073\"", "article_summary": "Police Officer Rosa Rodriguez is released from the burn center Monday.\nOfficer Guerra was fatally injured in the blaze, the first officer killed in the line of duty since 2011.\nMore than 100 police officers outside the hospital applauded as Ms. Rodriguez emerged from the hospital in a wheelchair.\nDeputy Inspector Carlos Valdez of PSA 1\u2014the precinct where both officers worked\u2014said Officer Rodriguez indicated am eagerness to rejoin the force.\nKevin Hagen for The Wall Street JournalNew York Police Department Officer Rosa Rodriguez was released from Weill Cornell Medical Center Monday, more than a month after she was overcome by smoke while responding to a Coney Island fire with her partner, Dennis Guerra."}
