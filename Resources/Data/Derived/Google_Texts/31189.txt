One of the east coast'ss biggest and oldest pow wows comes with 67 years of tradition. The Shinnecock Pow Wow, Sept 4-7, has become part of Long Island, New York's oldest traditions and on the things to do list of many residents as the unofficial last weekend of summer.

Kathy Isennock (Lakota), who is a champion fancy dancer and placed first at the pow wow, said of Shinnecock: "I like coming to Shinnecock. I love the artistic abilities our people retain and the outfits we create, but I love the courage the Shinnecock Nation has to keep their outfits as traditional as possible. It's hard to tell which tribe people are from nowadays, because people choose who they want to be and replicate other tribe's outfits. I appreciate the Shinnecock Nation for their confident display of their traditions".

Kathy is referring to the Eastern war and blanket styles of dance displayed during the weekend. Although it is a long weekend for the dancers and singers, it is differently lots of fun. There are plenty of dance specials, camp fires and a tasty feed each day for pow wow participants. See you at the 68th annual Shinnecock pow wow .
