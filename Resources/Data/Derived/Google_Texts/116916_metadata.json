Plus, people must enroll in a plan by Feb. 15 to avoid paying a bigger fine next year.\n\nAired 2/4/15 on KPBS News. The Feb. 15 deadline to enroll in a Covered California plan is forcing people to make a choice: buy coverage, or pay a fine.\n\nOn a recent weekday afternoon at the Old Town office of the nonprofit San Diegans for Healthcare Coverage, Rob Keller was trying to choose a health insurance plan. He brought his pay stubs because determining his annual income from his job as a waiter is key to finding out whether he\u2019s eligible for free Medi-Cal coverage, or a discounted Covered California plan.\n\n\n\n\"I\u2019ve had health insurance in the past, just because I was with my company,\" the 27 year old said. \"But I never really used it or needed it, I don\u2019t go to the doctor that much.\u201d\n\nEven so, Keller said the deadline prompted him to get with the program.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want a penalty for getting nothing,\" he said. \"I might as well pay money to get health insurance.\"\n\nMore than 17 million Californians get health insurance through their job. For Keller and the more than 6 million Californians who don\u2019t, the deadline looms large. By that date, they must be enrolled in a plan or they\u2019ll face a federal tax penalty on next year\u2019s return.\n\nThe penalty will be $975 per family, or 2 percent of annual household income, whichever amount is greater.\n\nSan Diego State professor of accounting Steven Gill said that\u2019s not a lot of money.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d rather pay nothing than something, but it\u2019s unlikely that anyone would have to go bankrupt because they ended up having to pay the penalties and the fines associated with Obamacare,\" Gill said.\n\nAs it turns out, Gill said the law prohibits the Internal Revenue Service from pursuing civil or criminal penalties to collect the Obamacare penalty.\n\n\u201cThe IRS isn\u2019t really going to pursue you with any rigorous enforcement, even if you don\u2019t pay it,\" he said.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service will simply subtract the penalty from any future refunds.\n\nBut there's a bigger risk than getting a smaller tax refund, said Jan Spencley, who directs San Diegans for Healthcare Coverage.\n\n\u201cI think the biggest penalty is not having coverage and not having access to care,\u201d she said.\n\nSpencley pointed out no one knows when they\u2019re going to be sick or have an accident. Without insurance, one trip to an emergency room can mean financial ruin, she said.\n\n\u201cSo people really need to understand there\u2019s value in insurance,\" Spencely said. \"It limits your liability, it gets you free preventive care, and it also makes sure you don\u2019t have small things turn into large things.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, local banking executive Toby Hayes and his wife, Stephanie, have decided to roll the dice.\n\nTheir six kids are covered under Medi-Cal, and Toby gets insurance through his job. But Stephanie is uninsured.\n\nToby said it was just a matter of finances.\n\n\u201cThe basic bronze plan for Stephanie, it was gonna be like $4,000 a year,\" Toby said. \"It comes down to like $334 a month, versus what we pay in the penalty, which was $763 for the year.\"\n\nThe couple who lives in Rancho Pe\u00f1asquitos is aware that the penalty will be higher in 2015. But Toby said it\u2019s still cheaper than buying health coverage.\n\nStephanie doesn't think she\u2019s taking a big chance by being uninsured.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been a very, very healthy person. If tomorrow, I come down with cancer, then we\u2019re gonna figure something out when we get there,\" she said. \"But right now, I hate wasting money.\u201d\n\nBut for people who believe health insurance is valuable and want to avoid a tax penalty, the deadline for enrolling in a Covered California plan is just over a week away.\n\nOtherwise, whatever health issues crop up, people will have to wait until the next open enrollment period to sign up.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Feb. 15 deadline to enroll in a Covered California plan is forcing people to make a choice: buy coverage, or pay a fine.", "author": "Kenny Goldberg", "og": {"site_name": "KPBS Public Media", "description": "The Feb. 15 deadline to enroll in a Covered California plan is forcing people to make a choice: buy coverage, or pay a fine.", "title": "Health Insurance Enrollment Deadline Forces Hard Choices For San Diegans", "url": "http://www.kpbs.org/news/2015/feb/04/covered-california-enrollment-deadline-looms-large/", "image": "https://kpbs.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/img/news/tease/2015/02/04/hayes_t700_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "has_audio": 1, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "KPBS", "fb": {"app_id": 131056773055}, "apiKpbs": "148751 %##% Health Insurance Enrollment Deadline Forces Hard Choices For San Diegans", "keywords": "Health, Health Insurance, Region, Central San Diego Region, Programs, Evening Edition", "verify-v1": "zHHWZpwcl/kpXf/ZbbmtRN41TWDeCfjQil8LGROx/LA=", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no,shrink-to-fit=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3436\"", "article_summary": "\"I\u2019ve had health insurance in the past, just because I was with my company,\" the 27 year old said.\nContent can be viewed at actual source page: http://youtu.be/pdlRM_zFDHIBefore Obamacare became law, health insurance was optional, but it\u2019s a federal requirement now.\nOn a recent weekday afternoon at the Old Town office of the nonprofit San Diegans for Healthcare Coverage, Rob Keller was trying to choose a health insurance plan.\nMore than 17 million Californians get health insurance through their job.\n\u201cThe IRS isn\u2019t really going to pursue you with any rigorous enforcement, even if you don\u2019t pay it,\" he said."}
