Keeping this in mind, a recent research led by Deborah Kimbrell, who is a Ph.D at the University of California, studied as to how microorganisms may alter fruit flies' immunity in space.\n\nFor the study, Deborah and his team sent flies to space for 12 days and allowed them to fully mature before bringing them back to Earth.\n\nThe results that were generated after 12 days showed that hypergravity and microgravity produced opposite immune response in the flies as when the flies were exposed to increased gravity they responded from infection by the fungus Beauveria bassiana through the Toll pathway but the similar did not happen in space gravity as there the toll pathway of flies failed to respond to the fungal infection.\n\n\"The pathway in flies did not respond in space, the Toll pathway is critical in humans for all kinds of health-related issues, both for functioning and for over-functioning. The Toll pathway (TLR4) response is involved in sepsis, which is still a big problem in human health\", said Kimbrell.\n\nThis study is published in PLOS ONE and the article is titled \"Toll Mediated Infection Response Is Altered by Gravity and Spaceflight in Drosophila\".\n\nConducting such a study will help solve biological problems associated with space travel and weak immune system is a major problem that is faced. So, this study is expected to help NASA in future at creating specialized countermeasures that will keep astronauts healthy during long-duration space missions to an asteroid or Mars.", "article_metadata": {}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcab1a\"", "article_summary": "Fruit flies have immune response mechanisms similar to humans so that they can act the perfect stand-ins for astronauts.\nThe Toll pathway (TLR4) response is involved in sepsis, which is still a big problem in human health\", said Kimbrell.\n\"The pathway in flies did not respond in space, the Toll pathway is critical in humans for all kinds of health-related issues, both for functioning and for over-functioning.\nFor the study, Deborah and his team sent flies to space for 12 days and allowed them to fully mature before bringing them back to Earth.\nConducting such a study will help solve biological problems associated with space travel and weak immune system is a major problem that is faced."}
