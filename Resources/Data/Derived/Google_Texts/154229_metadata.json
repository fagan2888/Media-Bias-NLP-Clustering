Patients, about 80 percent of whom have no insurance, can also see a dentist or obstetrician in Jeffersonville. And it has agreements to recommend patients to area specialists.\n\nThis summer, Harris spent a holiday weekend filling out a federal grant application for next year that would help fund a new clinic in Henryville and expand dental services to the New Albany office so patients wouldn\u2019t have to drive to Jeffersonville.\n\nHarris said she knows of no other funding source to replace the federal health center money it gets.\n\nBeth Keeney, LifeSpring\u2019s vice president of development and grants, said its consultants have assured it that its potential grant would not jeopardize Family Health Centers\u2019 funding, nor is it trying to lure patients away from those clinics.\n\nCiting data from the federal Health Resources and Services Administration, Keeney said there are many medically underserved residents in the area.\n\n\u201cIt would simply expand services in our community,\u201d Keeney said, who believes the two can coexist and continue working together to provide health care.\n\nFor example, LifeSpring plans to refer those needing dental services to the Jeffersonville clinic if it gets approved as a health center. And Keeney said it hopes Family Health Centers will continue referring patients to LifeSpring for mental health services.\n\n\u201cOur intent is to be able to provide affordable health care,\u201d Keeney said, noting Family Health Centers \u201cdoes a wonderful job and is a great organization.\u201d\n\nHarris said its staff this year also has taken on the role of \u201cnavigators,\u201d helping its uninsured patients sign up for new health insurance plans. Its patients are charged a sliding-scale fee based on income, though no one is turned away if they can\u2019t pay.\n\nState funding has remained stagnant. But increased federal funding in recent years, Harris said, has allowed it to purchase a bigger building from nearby Clark Memorial Hospital, add staff and equipment, and roughly quadruple its number of patients, who totaled almost 15,000 visits last year.\n\nPatient revenues generated about $578,000 last year, but 36 percent of self-pay patients didn\u2019t pay so the organization wrote off those expenses. It also received $4.6 million in donated services from Clark Memorial and gets funding through Metro United Way and the Jeffersonville township trustee\u2019s office.\n\nOther federal health centers average roughly 40 percent Medicaid patients, but Family Health Centers\u2019 focus has always been on the uninsured, she said.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a cushion of patient revenue,\u201d she said.\n\nWhile some of Family Health Centers\u2019 patients are homeless, Keeney said the federal homeless health center designation LifeSpring is seeking would allow it to provide free health care to the homeless, meaning there would be no mandatory minimum charge. Currently, some Southern Indiana organizations that work with the homeless refer patients to the Phoenix Family Health Center in Louisville, the closest one specifically designated for the homeless.\n\nReporter Charlie White can be reached at (812) 949-4026 or on Twitter @c_write.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cjky.it/1pdiUNW", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Officials with the Family Health Centers of Southern Indiana are worried about LifeSpring Health Systems applying to become a federally qualified health center, saying a second clinic area competing for the same patients \u2014 and what could be more limited federal money \u2014 may force it to cut staff or services.", "og": {"site_name": "The Courier-Journal", "description": "Officials with the Family Health Centers of Southern Indiana are worried about LifeSpring Health Systems applying to become a federally qualified health center, saying a second clinic area competing for the same patients \u2014 and what could be more limited federal money \u2014 may force it to cut staff or services.", "title": "LifeSpring clinic plan worries So.
