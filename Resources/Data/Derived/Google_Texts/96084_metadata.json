That\u2019s partly because behind the scenes, there is still widespread disagreement over whether a mental health bill should be Democrats\u2019 big opportunity to force votes on gun control.\n\nSen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), one of the co-sponsors of the bipartisan bill that came out of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee earlier this year, is telling his colleagues the two issues should not be mixed. His is a particularly compelling voice: He happens to also be one of the chief proponents for stricter gun laws. The Sandy Hook school shooting took place merely a month after Murphy was elected to the Senate.\n\nThe real challenge is convincing other Democrats to keep mental health and gun control separate. As a first-term senator, Murphy is hoping to lead on both issues, and he hopes his background makes him a powerful messenger.\n\n\u201cHopefully my opinion matters given my state\u2019s unique history,\u201d he said. \u201cListen, this is a fine line. You need to admit that there\u2019s an element of the gun violence epidemic that\u2019s rooted in the failure of our mental health system without continuing to add to the stigma that many people have about mental illness.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo yes, it would be difficult to not use an opportunity to run gun amendments on the Senate floor, but I think it would risk reinforcing the stigma that many of us are trying to erase,\u201d he added.\n\nIt\u2019s widely understood that Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is keen to avoid a fight over gun policy on the Senate floor in an election year. Therefore, a bill with the potential to force vulnerable senators to vote on controversial gun amendments is unlikely to see floor time. That hasn\u2019t stopped Democrats from being aggressive on the issue, forcing votes whenever possible and keeping up a steady stream of passionate floor speeches about gun violence.\n\nGun issues could pop up among Republicans as well. The mental health bill that passed out of the HELP Committee was co-sponsored by Chairman Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), ranking Democrat Patty Murray of Washington and Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.). Republican leaders are interested in combining that bill with mental health legislation sponsored by Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) that is currently in the Judiciary Committee.\n\nWhile most of Cornyn\u2019s bill is bipartisan and would change the way mental illness is handled in the criminal justice system, Democrats take issue with a provision that would alter the national background check system for those purchasing guns. Democrats say the revision currently in the Cornyn bill would make it easier for people with mental illnesses to obtain guns.\n\nWhen asked about the opposition to the background-check provision in his bill, Cornyn told Morning Consult he would \u201cbe interested in seeing what their suggestion is,\u201d a slight deviation from his previous hard-and-fast opposition to amending his legislation. But he is also aware that the real obstacles on guns might lie on the other side of the aisle.\n\n\u201cThe main person I\u2019ve heard from on that is Senator Murphy, [he] says he doesn\u2019t want gun amendments,\u201d Cornyn said. \u201cSo, I told him, I don\u2019t know how you keep senators from talking about what they want to talk about. Having said that, I\u2019m interested in finding a solution and advancing the ball on mental health.\u201d\n\nThe problem for Murphy is that several of his Democratic colleagues aren\u2019t sure he\u2019s right to hold off on pushing for tough gun-purchasing standards. The other Democratic senator from Connecticut, Richard Blumenthal, told Morning Consult he isn\u2019t yet sure whether the gun and mental health issues should be combined.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still hopeful that we can accomplish some gun violence prevention legislation, but I\u2019m very mindful of the importance of the mental health bill. And I wouldn\u2019t want to impede that progress,\u201d Blumenthal said. \u201cI don\u2019t know at this point. It depends on conversations that we\u2019re having right now.\u201d\n\nHe said he\u2019s had ongoing conversations with Murphy on the topic.\n\nOther senators haven\u2019t talked to Murphy, but are aware of his work. Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) said he hasn\u2019t thought through the issue, but he did give Murphy high praise. He said, in this case, the messenger really matters.\n\n\u201cSenator Murphy\u2019s obviously one of the biggest advocates for action on gun safety, so if he\u2019s trying to hold this legislation harmless, I would listen very carefully to that,\u201d Schatz said.\n\nBut for some Democrats, giving up an opportunity to do something on guns is too much of an ask. Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) said if a mental health bill should come to the floor, she would \u201cabsolutely\u201d consider adding a gun amendment. She has not yet talked to Murphy either.\n\nOther Democrats know such an endeavor would be useless.\n\n\u201cThey likely won\u2019t pass,\u201d said Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) of gun amendments to a mental health bill. \u201cSo until the citizens rise up and say do something, it\u2019s not going to happen. Nobody knows this better than I. So it\u2019s up to whomever wants to put them on, but I don\u2019t know what they would be.\u201d\n\nAs both sides continue to figure out how to get a mental health bill to the floor, perhaps the more prominent question is whether it will get floor time even if it is uncontroversial.\n\nMurphy said he met with McConnell on the matter last week, but time is \u201crunning short.\u201d\n\n\u201cEither the Senate is going to work or it\u2019s not going to work this year. If we\u2019re looking at the short list of legislation that can get to the president\u2019s desk, our mental health bill is at the top of it,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cSo it\u2019s a question Senator McConnell\u2019s got to answer. If he wants to just move appropriations bills in anticipation of an end-of-year omnibus, that\u2019s his prerogative. But this bill can get to the president\u2019s desk before the election, and everybody can go home and campaign on it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/icons/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "Morning Consult", "description": "The Senate is steamrolling into the annual appropriations process without yet addressing mental health, one of the year\u2019s most popular legislative efforts.
