In multiple speeches, Obama suggested that excess emergency room visits added almost $1000 a year to the average family\u2019s medical insurance costs.\n\nBut the argument that emergency room usage could be reduced by passing the health law never quite held up. In Massachusetts, which several years prior had enacted a similar health law, emergency room visits had increased. Obama\u2019s health reform relied heavily on an expansion of Medicaid, the joint federal-state health program for the poor and disabled\u2014but Medicaid recipients typically used the emergency room far more than other types of patients.\n\nThanks to the Supreme Court, which ruled that states could choose whether or not to expand Medicaid under the law without fear of losing their existing federal funding, we now have something of a natural experiment. Some states have expanded the health program. Others haven\u2019t.\n\nAnd the results are clear: Emergency room visits are up significantly more in expansion states than in non-expansion states, according to a new study by the Colorado Hospital Association which examined 450 hospitals in 25 states. Medicaid expansion states saw a 5.6 percent increase in emergency department visits in the second quarter of this year compared with the same period last year. Emergency department usage in non-expansion states saw a 1.8 percent increase, possibly because of people who were previously eligible for Medicaid getting covered and using emergency rooms more.\n\nThe increased utilization in the expansion states is not only significantly higher than in states that didn\u2019t expand, it\u2019s more than what might have been expected based on data from the previous two years.\n\nThe problem with emergency room usage is that it\u2019s expensive and inefficient\u2014which is why it\u2019s supposed to be used mainly in emergencies. So what the Medicaid expansion has done is put millions into a health system that encourages this kind of expensive, inefficient care.\n\nThe newly covered Medicaid population, meanwhile, isn\u2019t like the old one. It\u2019s likely sicker, according to the study. Which means they\u2019re even more expensive still.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen similar results in studies looking at a randomized experiment expanding Medicaid in Oregon. Overall, Medicaid looks likely to increase utilization throughout the health system. What it doesn\u2019t seem to do, as the Oregon experiment found, is increase physical health in a measurable way. That randomized controlled study, the single best examination of Medicaid\u2019s effects, found no statistically significant improvement in objective health outcomes. So we\u2019re sending people to the emergency room a lot more, and spending billions on expanded coverage in the process. But we may not be helping them get any healthier.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "When President Obama pitched his health care overhaul in 2008 and 2009, one of the arguments he often made was that the existing system relied too heavily", "title": "Emergency Room Usage is Way Up in Medicaid Expansion States", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2014/09/09/emergency-room-usage-is-way-up-in-medica", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/mc/psuderman/2014_07/Obama-affordable-health-care-sign-428.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "When President Obama pitched\nhis health care overhaul in 2008 and 2009, one of the arguments he\noften made was that the existing system relied too heavily on\nemergency room usage by the uninsured, which drove up the cost of\ncare for everyone else. \u201cIf there are affordable options and people\nstill don't sign up for health insurance, it means we pay for those\npeople's expensive emergency room visits,\u201d he", "creator": "@petersuderman", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/mc/psuderman/2014_07/Obama-affordable-health-care-sign-428.jpg", "title": "Emergency Room Usage is Way Up in Medicaid Expansion States", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "article": {"tag": "Policy", "published_time": "2014-09-09T16:08:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/peter-suderman"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0145\"", "article_summary": "But the argument that emergency room usage could be reduced by passing the health law never quite held up.\nThe problem with emergency room usage is that it\u2019s expensive and inefficient\u2014which is why it\u2019s supposed to be used mainly in emergencies.\nIn multiple speeches, Obama suggested that excess emergency room visits added almost $1000 a year to the average family\u2019s medical insurance costs.\nIn Massachusetts, which several years prior had enacted a similar health law, emergency room visits had increased.\nSo we\u2019re sending people to the emergency room a lot more, and spending billions on expanded coverage in the process."}
