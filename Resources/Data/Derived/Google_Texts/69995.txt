A hiker was injured Sunday after falling about 300 feet in a sustained slide down a peak near Aspen, according to the Pitkin County Sheriff’s Office.

The man fell about 2 p.m. on a “knife edge ridge” that connects Capitol Peak, a 14,130-foot mountain, to a sub peak known as K2.

A guide with Aspen Expeditions, who was leading a group down the mountain, discovered the injured climber at about 13,500 feet, the office said.

A Black Hawk helicopter from the High Altitude Training Center in Aspen transported the man to Aspen Valley Hospital with what are believed to be non life-threatening injuries, according to Deputy George Kremer.

Kremer said the hiker’s name and information about where he was from was not immediately available.
