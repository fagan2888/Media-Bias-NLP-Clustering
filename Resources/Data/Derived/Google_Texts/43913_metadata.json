Ravenna is showing four different ways to create main-level living, that\u2019ll all include scenery and a carefully managed sense of community.\n\nRavenna\u2019s visitor center, five minutes south of C-470 on Wadsworth, is just outside the gates \u2013 from where you can be escorted in to see the rocks, the course, and just how pretty this really is. \u201cWe\u2019re very much about creating a boutique experience for you,\u201d says Dale Schossow, Listing Broker and Managing Partner at Ravenna. \u201cWe greet everybody and want to provide you a very personal tour.\u201d\n\nWhat you\u2019re not going to see is ranches ready for move-in \u2013 not in this market. \u201cEven with the fast pace of sales in Colorado now, it\u2019s much tougher for builders to do spec-versions of a luxury ranch now than it was a decade ago,\u201d Schossow adds. But that\u2019s not to say there\u2019s not lots of activity now: Ravenna has luxury ranches underway by three prominent builders, not counting ones for buyers who pick a site and find their own architect/builder.\n\nStarting with Remington Homes, a pioneer in building ranch patio homes, priced from the $700s for a dramatic setting along the west side of the Dakota Hogback \u2014 all built to Ravenna\u2019s high level of trim in Old World, southern Mediterranean architecture. Also by legendary builder Thomas Sattler Homes, with sites near the Clubhouse for homes from the $900s that have 360-degree views, and by Tom Burdick of Burdick Homes, from the mid-$800s. Each, says Schossow, show sites positioned to increase in value. \u201cPrices will be going up,\u201d he adds.\n\nYou\u2019ll experience the duality of Ravenna\u2019s setting \u2013 so close that my drive from the DTC was 25 minutes, but with an ambience that\u2019s remarkably secluded as soon as you pass into its rock-lined vales. \u201cIt feels like a hideaway,\u201d says Schossow, who says that Ravenna is culturing that sensation now with services and events crafted around its clubhouse that make for quick relationships between neighbors.\n\n\u201cThis is a place where you\u2019ll drive in Friday night and you may never get in your car the rest of the weekend,\u201d Schossow said. Alternative pursuits include the golf (new golf director George Kahrhoff \u201chas taken the experience here and totally recreated it,\u201d Schossow adds); and the culinary work by Executive Chef Christopher Moore, which lured a packed house to Ravenna\u2019s temporary clubhouse for Mother\u2019s Day brunch last weekend. \u201cYou\u2019re going to see a community that\u2019s a step above anything else you can find; better staff, service, landscape,\u201d says Kevin Collins, who\u2019s lived here since 2009 and became managing partner last fall. \u201cRavenna is becoming the place it was always meant to be.\u201d\n\nClub membership is optional, but Schossow says you\u2019ll be surprised at the affordable value, particularly with respect to the permanent clubhouse under design. If you can, call ahead before you drive out; then take C-470 to Wadsworth and head south four miles to Waterton Road, turn left a half mile to Dante, and right to the sales center.\n\nTour new home sites for luxury ranch plans in Ravenna, gated golf community wrapped in red rocks, national forest; builders include Remington Homes Golf Villas, Burdick Homes, Thomas Sattler Homes European Estate Collection; concierge services. 11118 Caretaker Rd., Littleton; from C470 exit S.
