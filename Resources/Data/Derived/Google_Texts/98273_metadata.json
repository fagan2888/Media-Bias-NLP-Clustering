That includes a $50,000 annual fee.\n\nThat's up from $493,778 the district spent on on substitute teachers during the 2011-12 school year and $439,166 in 2012-13 school year, according to the charts.\n\nBauer said he did not include the district's additional costs for the salaries, benefits and pensions to which about five long-term substitutes were entitled in the two school years before the district started using Source4Teachers.\n\nOnce a substitute worked more than 20 days in the same classroom teaching the same subject, the district placed him or her on the salary guide for a new teacher, Bauer said. That's in compliance with New Jersey Department of Education regulations.\n\nBauer estimates an average cost of $75,000, including benefits, for each new teacher the district hires. The median salary of a teacher in the district for the 2013-14 school year was $68,561, according to Department of Education data.\n\n\"As you can see by the numbers, it doesn't take a lot to create a lot of expense for the district,\" Bauer said.\n\nThe school board voted in September to renew its contract with Source4Teachers for another two years.\n\nSuperintendent George Chando said the daily placement rate of substitute teachers through Source4Teachers is almost equal to when the district handled the staffing internally, which is \"very, very good\" for a district Phillipsburg's size.\n\nWhen a substitute is unavailable for a class, other teachers have to cover the class, usually during their preparation periods. Chando said the district has to pay teachers extra for that because of their contract.\n\n\"One of the benefits of using Source4Teachers is they have a larger pool of candidates for specific areas, especially at the secondary level,\" Chando said, noting the difficulty in staffing math and science classes. \"Districts struggle to find candidates to fill permanent positions in those areas.\"\n\nPhillipsburg used 5,414 substitutes last year compared to about 4,458 during the 2012-13 school year and 5,088 during the 2011-12 year.\n\nThe company bills the district $110.82 for a short-term substitute who makes $85 a day, according to a copy obtained via an OPRA request of the company's agreement with the district. The district also paid substitutes $85 a day prior to using Source4Teachers.\n\nThe company bills $162.98 a day for a long-term substitute, defined as one who works in a position for more than 20 days. Those substitutes earn $125 a day.\n\nAdministrators say new \"Obamacare\" regulations requiring employers to offer health insurance to employees who work more than 30 hours a week make it practical to outsource substitute teacher staffing. Keeping track of who is eligible for benefits is the company's responsibility, not Bauer's or his staff's, he said.\n\nThe company normally hires substitute teachers as part-time employees who work less than 30 hours per week, so they are ineligible. The district is required to pay a surcharge for the minimum health insurance plan for substitutes assigned to positions for more than 60 days, according to the agreement.", "article_metadata": {"article_author": "Sarah Peters | The Express-Times", "medium": "news", "news_keywords": "'@mobile','@topstories','george chando','phillipsburg school district','source4teachers','william bauer'", "title": "Phillipsburg School District releases substitute teacher expenses", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Phillipsburg School District releases substitute teacher expenses\", \"link\": \"http://www.lehighvalleylive.com/phillipsburg/index.ssf/2014/11/phillipsburg_school_district_r_2.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.lehighvalleylive.com/home/lvlive-media/width620/img/phillipsburg_impact/photo/16251729-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"14388276\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-11-04T12:32:00Z\", \"author\": \"Sarah Peters | The Express-Times\", \"tags\": [\"@mobile\",\"@topstories\",\"george chando\",\"phillipsburg school district\",\"source4teachers\",\"william bauer\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.lehighvalleylive.com/phillipsburg_impact/photo/16251729-thumb_square_large.jpg", "description": "The district spent $684,426 during last school year, the first for which it entered into a contract with Source4Teachers, according to numbers provided by William Bauer.", "card": "summary", "site": "@lehighvalley"}, "article_date_updated": "Tuesday, November 04, 2014,  7:31 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.lehighvalleylive.com/phillipsburg_impact/photo/phillipsburgfirstdayjpg-8acf8bbd01cddb13.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"sapeters\", \"author_nickname\": \"Sarah Peters | The Express-Times\", \"author_id\": \"9586683\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Phillipsburg Area News\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.lehighvalleylive.com/phillipsburg/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "lehighvalleylive.com", "description": "The district spent $684,426 during last school year, the first for which it entered into a contract with Source4Teachers, according to numbers provided by William Bauer.", "title": "Phillipsburg School District releases substitute teacher expenses", "url": "http://www.lehighvalleylive.com/phillipsburg/index.ssf/2014/11/phillipsburg_school_district_r_2.html", "image": "http://www.lehighvalleylive.com/static/aff/static/img/logos/logo_fb.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "lehighvalleylive.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Tuesday, November 04, 2014,  7:30 AM", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "Description": "The district spent $684,426 during last school year, the first for which it entered into a contract with Source4Teachers, according to numbers provided by William Bauer."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd141d\"", "article_summary": "A Phillipsburg School District administrator says outsourcing substitute teacher staffing has saved on more than just health-care costs.\nThat's up from $493,778 the district spent on on substitute teachers during the 2011-12 school year and $439,166 in 2012-13 school year, according to the charts.\nThe company normally hires substitute teachers as part-time employees who work less than 30 hours per week, so they are ineligible.\nAdministrators say new \"Obamacare\" regulations requiring employers to offer health insurance to employees who work more than 30 hours a week make it practical to outsource substitute teacher staffing.\n\"As you can see by the numbers, it doesn't take a lot to create a lot of expense for the district,\" Bauer said."}
