Bass Pro Reels In Ranger, Stratos, Triton Fishing Boat Brands

The deal marks an exit for Platinum Equity, which bought the brands in 2010

Bass Pro Group LLC is buying Fishing Holdings LLC from Platinum Equity for an undisclosed amount.

Flippin, Arkansas-based Fishing manufactures the Ranger Boats, Stratos and Triton fishing boat brands. The company makes both fiberglass and aluminum fishing boats.

Bass Pro, headquartered in Springfield, Missouri, sells fishing and boating equipment as well as hunting, camping, cooking, footwear and nature-themed gifts.

Platinum bought Ranger boats and Stratos as part of a larger group of boat brands in February 2010, from an auction conducted in Genmar Holdings Inc.'s bankruptcy case. The PE firm bought Triton from Brunswick in July 2010.

Platinum, headquartered in Los Angeles, has more than $7 billion in assets under management. The firm invests in manufacturing, information technology, telecommunications, transportation and logistics and other industries. The firm also backs Schutt Sports, which bought the rest of sports equipment company Adams USA in November.

Harris Williams & Co. advised Fishing on the deal, and Latham & Watkins provided legal advice.

In other recent lifestyle deals, Running Specialty Group picked up Run Colorado, a group of specialty running shops, and Kent International Inc. bought Stoneridge Cycle Ltd.
