Y\u2019know, real crackpot material.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the president\u2019s rhetoric, and if you look at his actions, everything he has done has been to cut the legs out of Israel and lift up the agenda of radical Islam,\u201d she said. \u201cAny nation that accepts God and his principles is blessed, and those who push away are cursed.
