Chuck Schumer has compared Senate Republicans\u2019 attempt to block a potential Supreme Court nominee to Republican action during the 2013 government shutdown.\n\n\u201cWhen the hard right doesn\u2019t get its way, their immediate reaction is to shut it down,\u201d Schumer said in a press call Wednesday.\n\nSchumer referred to Republican action during the shutdown, when congressional Republicans and Democrats reached an impasse over the budget after disputes over Obamacare in October 2013 it shut down the government for 16 days. Congressional Republicans were largely blamed for the shutdown.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what happened in 2013 when the Republican leadership tried to shut down the government,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re doing it today with their attempts to shut down the Supreme Court. But just as in 2013 when there was a huge public outcry and Sen. McConnell had to back off, the same will happen now. Sen. McConnell will have to back off.\u201d\n\nConnecticut Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal agreed with Schumer\u2019s assessment, saying Senate Republicans are \u201cdragging the court into the morass of partisan politics and gridlock.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs I go around the state of Connecticut, what I find is that the outrage and outcry against shutting down the Supreme Court in effect is motivated by all the feelings that were caused by shutting down the government,\u201d said Blumenthal.\n\nA seat on the Supreme Court is now vacant after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia Saturday. Several Senate Republicans have said the next president should make the nomination and asserted they will move to block any nominee Obama puts forward.\n\nSenators are split along largely partisan lines on whether the current president should nominate the next justice. Of the 54 Republican senators, 29 have said President Obama should not nominate a successor; on the other hand, 44 of the 46 Democratic senators have said the president should nominate a successor, according to the New York Times.\n\n\u201cIt has been over 80 years since a lame-duck president has appointed a Supreme Court justice,\u201d said presidential candidate Marco Rubio during the Feb. 13 GOP debate in South Carolina.\n\nIn fact, as moderator John Dickinson pointed out, Justice Anthony Kennedy was actually confirmed by the Senate in Ronald Reagan\u2019s final year as president, though he was appointed the previous year.\n\nAn analysis by SCOTUSBlog revealed there were no instances of the president \u201cfailing to nominate and/or the Senate failing to confirm a nominee in a presidential election year because of the impending election\u201d since at least 1900. The article lists several instances of presidents nominating potential justices in presidential election years, including President Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s nomination and the Senate\u2019s confirmation of Frank Murphy in 1940, the year he was up for reelection.\n\n\u201cThe Constitution is pretty clear about what is supposed to happen now,\u201d President Obama said at a press conference yesterday.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no unwritten law that says that it can only be done on off years,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThat\u2019s not in the constitutional text.\u201d\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell issued a statement on filling the vacancy shortly after Scalia\u2019s death was announced on Saturday.\n\n\u201cThe American people\u200e should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice,\u201d McConnell said in the statement. \u201cTherefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president.\u201d\n\nIowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley, who originally agreed with McConnell and asserted the next president should pick the nominee, has since said he will \u201cwait until the nominee is made\u201d before making a decision.\n\nSchumer and Blumenthal said they still expect senators to scrutinize and vet each potential nominee; they are simply asking for an up-or-down vote.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re asking for a hearing and a vote,\u201d said Schumer. \u201cWe\u2019re not asking for Congress to be a rubber stamp.\u201d\n\nUtah Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch spoke out against blocking judicial nominations on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we should filibuster Supreme Court nominees or any judicial nominees,\u201d Hatch told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Toni Ann Booras", "description": "Sen.
