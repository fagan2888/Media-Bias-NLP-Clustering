I had the 2015 Mercedes Benz E400 Cabriolet to play with for a week. This one definitely exemplifies what an elegant piece of metal should look like and feel like. It\u2019s of the midsize luxury distinction and there is so much to choose from in the E series it\u2019s hard to know where to begin.\n\nLet\u2019s start with determining your perfect body style, the type of engine you crave and if you want to be eco-friendly or not, and from there add on the sophistication and a great ride, which comes in all the E series selections.\n\nThe only addition in 2015 in the Mercedes-Benz E-Class is the new E400 styling that adds a turbocharged V6 engine, other minor adjustments are just improved tweaking to an already stellar product.\n\nAlready, Mercedes lovers, whether you own one or just have it on your bucket list, know the technology is right and always above par, the look is extraordinaire and the driving \u2026 well just about the best on the road. The Mercedes E-Series E400 meshed in all the right ways during my drive time and together we took the road as one. Indeed, I dare say if you own one of the E-Series options it might feel more at home inside than your home does, you will definitely want to spend as much time as possible taking it out and about for show.\n\nThe competition here includes the Audi A6, Lexus GS and the BMW 5 Series, but there is just a bit more to be said about driving this head turner no matter your brand loyalty.\n\nAs for trims, there is the sedan, coupe, convertible (Cabriolet) and a wagon for this midsize luxury option and from there you get to choose from engine choices with a mix and match of trims that include the diesel E250 Bluetec or the E400 Hybrid that come in the sedan only, or the V6 E350 in sedan or a wagon and the V8 E550 in a coupe or convertible. There is also a turbocharged V8 E63 AMG in a choice of sedan or wagon.\n\nWith the E250, E350 and E400 four-doors there is the Luxury or Sport options and as the name implies the Luxury trim is finer for class driving with 17-inch alloy wheels and a good looking grille or the Sport model has 18-inch wheels, a two-bar grille and a three-pointed star and sport-tuned suspension. The sport version also looks sporty inside with white-faced gauges and a three-spoke steering wheel versus the four spokes on the luxury trim. Also included are LED headlights and taillights with a sunroof, a multi-zone climate control, 14 ways to move your seat and simulated leather upholstery. Even more, there is the tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel with auto-dimming mirrors, COMAND electronics interface and eight speakers, Bluetooth and an iPod/USB interface.\n\nOn the E400 coupe or convertible option, this matches up with the equipment on the E350 Sport sedan, but don\u2019t forget about the Hybrid personality too. Overall, the E400 boasts 17-inch wheels and a hybrid powertrain with keyless ignition and entry, leather seating all the way and with a rearview camera, power-folding mirrors with split-folding rear seats on the sedan only and the COMAND with a navigation and 14 speakers. On the cabriolet, it is also equipped with an AirScarf neck-warming system and heated front seats.\n\nThe Lane Tracking package comes standard on the E400 and that includes a powerful warning if you drift outside of your lane and also a blind spot warning too. As well, all the convertibles have a power-folding soft top with a rear center pass-through and a pop-up air deflector.\n\nUnder the hood, most of the 2015 Mercedes-Benz E-Class options can be had in either rear or all-wheel drive, but on the E400 Hybrid that one is a rear-wheel drive only. All have seven-speed automatic transmission and that includes shift paddles on the steering wheel and the automatic stop-start function for fuel economy.\n\nThe E250 Bluetec has a turbocharged 2.1-liter diesel-fueled four-cylinder engine with 195 horsepower and 369 pound-feet of torque while the E350 offers the 3.5-liter V6 engine with 302 horsepower and 273 pound feet of torque or the E400 Hybrid with a V6 and lithium-ion battery pack and electric motor. For the E400 you get a turbocharged 3.0-liter V6 engine that kicks out all you are going to need with 329 horsepower and 354 pound feet of torque. All the way at the top of the line, you can\u2019t neglect to consider the E63 AMG turbocharged 5.5-liter V8 engine with 550 horsepower and 531 pound feet of torque as well.\n\nSafety on the 2015 E-Class means standard with antilock disc brakes, stability control; front, front-side, front pelvic, side curtain and driver knee airbags as well as a drowsiness monitor for the driver to be aware of his condition behind the wheel. There is also a telematics system with a smartphone integration and a variety of apps that include remote controls and on the convertibles you also get rollover hoops that automatically deploy if needed.\n\nYou can opt for a few safety options that include rear airbags and there is also a front and rear-collision systems and a Driver Assistance package that includes steering assist using a camera to keep you in your own lane.\n\nInside the 2015 E-Series you will feel right at home, literally, since the touch is classy and welcoming with wood veneer options, an analog clock and the gear selector on the steering column, which takes some time to get used to, but turns out to be easy enough. Finally there is that COMAND electronics interface and that offers a display screen along with knobs and buttons on the dash or the voice command function, which suggests a private butler working for you as you drive.\n\nOf course, this Mercedes is all comfort all the time, plenty of room all around, perfect for long trips and on the AMG model the seats are sportier, but indeed comfort still plays a key role here too. On the sedan expect about 16 cubic-feet for hauling and the wagon comes in around 57.4 cubic feet in addition to the rear-facing third-row seat. On the coupe you get 13.3 cubic-feet in the trunk and for the convertible it is 11.5 with the top up or a little under nine with the top down.\n\nBehind the wheel of the 2015 Mercedes-Benz E-Class, especially the E400 Cabriolet I drove it was all perfection meaning it was a straight up classy ride with a sporty feel, but I just always seemed to feel in complete control and 100% comfortable. Perhaps there is not a lot the Mercedes-Benz folks can still do with the E-Class to create perfection since the name implies it already, indeed, to know the standard on the E-Series and you know it has been set very high and achieved.\n\nShould You Need to Know: Making its appearance first in 2010, the 2015 Mercedes-Benz E-Series offers a variety of 0 to 60 acceleration choices if that is what you are looking for \u2013 from the E250\u2019s 7.6-second to the E350 sedan\u2019s 6.0 seconds to the E400 with the turbo V6 engine coming in at a good 5.5 seconds to hit the mark.\n\nMiles Per Gallon: On the 2015 Mercedes-Benz E400 Cabriolet I drove, gas mileage came in at 20 miles per gallon in the city and 29 miles per gallon on the highway.\n\nCost: The 2015 Mercedes-Benz E400 Cabriolet had a price tag of $76,225.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In my ongoing quest for the ultimate luxury driving experience this week, it's the 2015 Mercedes-Benz E-Class that takes center stage.
