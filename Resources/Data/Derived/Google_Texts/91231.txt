CLEVELAND, Ohio --Some Cuyahoga County residents will be eligible for free tax preparation assistance being offered by Cuyahoga County and the Cuyahoga Earned Income Tax Credit Coalition.

Residents who earn less than $52,427 a year and are filing a simple return are eligible to participate, county officials reported Wednesday. For a full list of workshop locations and to schedule an appointment, visit www.refundohio.org or call 2-1-1 for help.

The program also will include several "Super Saturday" events at which a larger number of volunteers will be available to provide additional assistance.

These include:

Saint Ignatius High School, 1911 West 30th St., Cleveland

Cleveland Central Catholic High School, 6550 Baxter Ave., Cleveland

In 2014, 12,000 people used the tax preparation program and received $14.8 million worth of tax refunds, county officials said.

Required documentation for tax preparation will include: current photo ID, social security cards for each child and adult, W2 and 1099 income statements, child-care expense statements and provider's Tax I.D. Number, Form 1099-INT for any checking or savings accounts, and bank account and routing numbers for direct deposit.

Anyone who bought health insurance under the Affordable Care Act must bring their 1099 tax credit from the issuing health insurance company.

The federal tax filing deadline this year is April 15.
