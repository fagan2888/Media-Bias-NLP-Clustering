Democrats haven\u2019t moved drastically to the left \u2014 if anything they inched right for a couple of decades, and are only now shuffling slightly back toward a more robust liberalism. But Republicans have barreled off to the right.\n\nThis is, as I said, obvious \u2014 except that for those whose whole professional self-image involves standing between the supposed extremes, it\u2019s too painful to acknowledge. So it\u2019s worth pointing out specific policy areas where we can trace the positions of the parties explicitly.\n\nOne prime example is, of course, health reform: yes, Obamacare is identical in all important respects to Romneycare, which in turn followed a blueprint originally propounded at the Heritage Foundation.\n\nEnvironmental policy may, however, be an even better case. Cap and trade began as a Republican idea \u2014 a corrective to command-and-control regulation. There was, in fact, a time when many Democrats disliked the idea of using market mechanisms to limit pollution, so this was a case of Republicans pushing policy in the direction of good economics. Bush the elder introduced cap and trade to control acid rain; John McCain even sponsored a climate change bill that relied on cap and trade.\n\nBut now Republican candidates for president are scrambling to declare themselves against the Obama administration\u2019s proposals; Mitch McConnell is urging states to defy the feds and refuse to implement the regulations.\n\nLeave on one side the sheer evilness of sabotaging efforts to avert environmental catastrophe in pursuit of political gain. Just note where the divide comes from.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20150803084416, "BN": "krugman", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/krugman", "DISPLAYDATE": "August 3, 2015", "keywords": "Uncategorized", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/krugman/Cap and Trade and Polarization ( 20150803 )", "PT": "Blogs", "SCG": "krugman", "sourceApp": "blogs", "twitter": {"description": "Who\u2019s responsible for the gap?", "title": "Cap and Trade and Polarization", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/08/03/cap-and-trade-and-polarization/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "site": "@NytimesKrugman", "card": "summary"}, "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/krugman/post", "description": "Who\u2019s responsible for the gap?", "CG": "Opinion", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "August 3, 2015", "article": {"published_time": 1438605856, "author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/paulkrugman/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Uncategorized", "modified_time": "2015-08-03T12:44:16-04:00"}, "utime": 20150803124416, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20150803, "pdate": 20150803, "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "Paul Krugman Blog", "description": "Who\u2019s responsible for the gap?", "title": "Cap and Trade and Polarization", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/08/03/cap-and-trade-and-polarization/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/08/03/cap-and-trade-and-polarization/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "Cap and Trade and Polarization", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "article_summary": "Bush the elder introduced cap and trade to control acid rain; John McCain even sponsored a climate change bill that relied on cap and trade.\nCap and trade began as a Republican idea \u2014 a corrective to command-and-control regulation.\nLeave on one side the sheer evilness of sabotaging efforts to avert environmental catastrophe in pursuit of political gain.\nSo it\u2019s worth pointing out specific policy areas where we can trace the positions of the parties explicitly.\nThis is, as I said, obvious \u2014 except that for those whose whole professional self-image involves standing between the supposed extremes, it\u2019s too painful to acknowledge."}
