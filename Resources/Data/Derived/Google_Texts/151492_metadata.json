King, were two doctors from the University of New Mexico. The doctors argued they should be allowed to prescribe their patient, Aja Riggs, a lethal dose of life-ending medication to allow her to die.\n\nRiggs was diagnosed with \u201clife threatening uterine cancer,\u201d according to court documents, and testified that she did not know if she \u201cwant[ed] to go all the way to the end\u201d of her illness with everybody that cares about her \u201cjust wanting for me to die.\u201d\n\nPowerful groups such as the ACLU of New Mexico backed their case.\n\nThe lawsuit defines physician-assisted suicide as the \u201cpractice of a physician providing a mentally competent, terminally ill patient with a prescription for [a lethal dose of] medication which the patient may choose to ingest to achieve a peaceful death and thereby avoid further suffering.\u201d\n\nOne of the plaintiffs, Dr. Katherine Morris, is a surgical oncologist who previously practiced medicine in Oregon, which is one of three states where assisted suicide is legal. Assisted suicide is also allowed in Washington and Vermont, and has been judicially recognized in Montana.\n\nAfter the New Mexico Court of Appeals reversed the lower court\u2019s ruling on Tuesday, an attorney for Riggs and the two doctors said she plans to appeal the case to the U.S Supreme Court.\n\nIn its opinion, the appeals court recognized the possibility of the Supreme Court taking on this case or another like it, and said:\n\n\u201cIt goes without saying that our Supreme Court will have the final word. But it does not follow that this Court must remain mute until it does.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "New Mexico struck down a lower court's ruling that legalized assisted suicide, and now the case could go to the U.S. Supreme Court.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "New Mexico struck down a lower court's ruling that legalized assisted suicide, and now the case could go to the U.S. Supreme Court.", "title": "New Mexico Rules Assisted Suicide Is Illegal", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/zumaamericastwelve809345.jpg", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1JU7EE8"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "New Mexico struck down a lower court's ruling that legalized assisted suicide, and now the case could go to the U.S. Supreme Court.", "title": "New Mexico Rules Assisted Suicide Is Illegal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/zumaamericastwelve809345.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "Protecting Life", "published_time": "2015-08-12T15:45:47+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "assisted suicide, right to die, death with dignity, new mexico assisted suicide, new mexico right to die, Morris v.
