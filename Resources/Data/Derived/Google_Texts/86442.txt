About 73,000 policy holders around the state will lose their insurance in coming months because nine insurance companies are dropping some health plans that were not grandfathered under the Affordable Care Act, the Maryland Insurance Administration confirmed Monday.

The act requires plans to carry minimum benefits. Only those policies created before March 23, 2010, when the health law passed can be grandfathered, according to the law.

The insurance administration said the plans are being replaced with stronger coverage. The law requires all health plans to end lifetime limits on coverage, end arbitrary cancellations of health coverage and cover adult children on their parents' plans up to age 26, among other benefits.
