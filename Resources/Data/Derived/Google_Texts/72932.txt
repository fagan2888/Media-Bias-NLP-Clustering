Emma Watson showed off her beatboxing skills recently alongside Hamilton creator and star Lin-Manuel Miranda in a new video in support of gender-equality.

The clip which was filmed on National Women's Day and shared on Miranda's Facebook page Thursday, was made in support of the United Nations' HeForShe organization which campaigns for a gender equal world.

As the duo sit down together, Miranda agrees to showcase his freestyle rap skills but only if Watson is willing to beatbox for him. "English school kids, we do that all the time, we just beatbox," the actress and U.N. goodwill ambassador joked before mentioning how embarrassed she felt to be doing it.

Once Watson drops the beat, Miranda then unleashes an impressive freestyle about gender equality. "Yo, it's Lin and I have to laugh, how can we not be equal, we're like half. Like women are half of the people on Earth," he raps. "And yes they should've been equal since birth. That means all day, every day, equal pay, every way."

"And here's a SHORT clip of Emma Watson beatboxing while I freestyle about #HeForShe, if you only have 3 minutes. This was so fun," he wrote on Facebook alongside the video.

Miranda and other members of the Hamilton cast recently visited the White House where the Broadway star freestyled for President Barrack Obama about Obamacare, NASA and the constitution.

In February, Watson revealed that she plans on taking a break from acting to focus on activism and her own self-growth. "I want to try to talk to people who might not encounter feminism and talk to them about feminism," she shared about life after Hollywood. "It's a really interesting job and it's a really interesting line to tread. I want to engage in the topic with people who wouldn't normally."
