Sen. Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, says the president \u201cis the single worst negotiator we have had in the White House in my lifetime.\u201d But Obama is hardly even a negotiator. He is more like an exhausted poker player who shoves all his chips into the middle of the table and stalks out of the room.\n\nMany experts now predict that the influx of American investment will no more liberalize Havana than it has Hanoi or Beijing. It turns out that American dollars and political prisons go well together.\n\n\n\n[SEE: Editorial Cartoons on the Sony Hack]\n\nIn Hong Kong, Beijing applied the determined use of force and threats of legal harassment to demoralize the forces of democracy, prompting the Umbrella Movement to fold. China\u2019s solemn pledge of \u201cone country, two systems\u201d turns out to be just another reselling of the Brooklyn Bridge. (A Chinese executive I know was astonished that Westerners had actually taken Beijing\u2019s rhetorical promise seriously.)\n\n\n\nAnd then there\u2019s Sony, which capitulated to a cyberattack and threats of violence by mothballing \"The Interview.\" Sony\u2019s surrender proved the ability of North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un to reach into American society, frighten Hollywood celebrities into abandoning their colleagues and dupe the news media into undermining free speech. Kim\u2019s success is now an open-source template that dictators, billionaires and the world\u2019s growing list of Bond villains can use to intimidate free speech around the world.\n\nOf course, the use of power to punish speech is hardly new. What is new is that today\u2019s tyrants are adept at the use of the soft power of embarrassment, intellectual theft and insincere promises solemnly delivered to get what they want.\n\nIn the early 1980s, at the height of Cold War tensions with the Soviet Union, a French intellectual named Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Revel released a somber book, \"How Democracies Perish.\" In it, Revel wrote that democracy \u201ctends to ignore, even deny, threats to its existence because it loathes doing what is needed to counter them. It awakens only when the danger becomes deadly, imminent, evident. By then, either there is too little time left for it to save itself, or the price of survival has become crushingly high.\u201d\n\n\n\n[GALLERY: Editorial Cartoons on North Korea]\n\nWe need a sustained national dialogue on how to prevent falling into Revel\u2019s trap. Toward this end, it would help to have a president who would lead this dialogue. Given that this leadership probably won\u2019t emerge until 2017, here are in the meantime some New Year\u2019s resolutions we can all adopt to counter future, soft-power attacks.\n\n1) We will stand by victims in attacks on free speech. Hollywood cherishes the memory of standing up to the blacklisting era, and prides itself on fearlessly speaking truth to power. But when real power came calling \u2013 in the guise of a dark, angry, intimidating cybermonster \u2013 Hollywood ran screaming in its undies like Will Ferrell in \"Talladega Nights.\"\n\nThe backlash against Sony alone, however, is misguided. Sony waved the white flag because almost no one stood by it. Absent support from other studios, theater chains and movie stars who refused to sign George Clooney\u2019s letter of support \u2013 absent, especially, any sign of support from the Obama White House \u2013 Sony had little choice but to protect its shareholders and employees.\n\nEvery news outlet (I\u2019m talking about you, Variety) needs to understand that what was done to this studio can be done to a newspaper, magazine or network news organization. In my youthful newsroom experience, the catty remarks made by Sony executives were air kisses compared to the kinds of things editors and reporters say in emails about each other, not to mention the publishers. Be assured that what is good for the gander won\u2019t be as tasty.\n\n\n\n[GALLERY: Barack Obama Cartoons]\n\n2) Don\u2019t give into the temptation for self-censorship. China, Russia and many other authoritarian regimes invest a great deal into the apparatus of censorship. But there cannot be a censor for every blogger, journalist or filmmaker. So these systems practice economy in terror, making a horrific example out of one outspoken person, publication or studio. Fear does the rest.\n\nThe greatest danger then from the Sony debacle is not another cyberattack. It is that writers and artists will quietly begin to edit themselves. Don\u2019t let anyone insert a fear filter into your head.\n\n3) Be a nuisance. If Cuba does open up to tourism, go there. Spend your money and enjoy the beach. As you do, don\u2019t forget to document human rights abuses with your smartphone. Seek out dissidents and interview them for your blog. As for myself, I would like to walk down Havana\u2019s Malec\u00f3n wearing a Che Guevara shirt with an \u201cX\u201d across his pretty face.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "title": "Obama's Cuba Move and North Korea Sony Hack Make a Good Week for Dictators", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Cuba and North Korea won the week.", "title": "A Good Week for Tyrants", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/mark-davis/2014/12/19/obamas-cuba-move-and-north-korea-sony-hack-make-a-good-week-for-dictators", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/c7/e5/42067e474d76ab53863632cbb3f1/20141218edsuc-a.tif", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Cuba and North Korea won the week.", "site": "@USNews", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama's Cuba Move and North Korea Sony Hack Make a Good Week for Dictators"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "opinion", "date_published": "Dec. 19, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Mark W.
