Scott Walker (R) appeared on MSNBC this morning and covered quite a bit of ground, including fielding several questions about health care. Of particular interest was the far-right governor\u2019s vision for replacing the Affordable Care Act. Igor Volsky picked up on a key problem with Walker\u2019s position.\n\nWisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R) encouraged Republicans on Wednesday to look to the organization that originated the key tenets of Obamacare in developing alternatives to President Obama\u2019s health care law. Asked during an appearance on Morning Joe to name a specific Republican solution to providing health care coverage to America\u2019s uninsured, Walker pleaded that he\u2019s \u201cnot in the federal government\u201d before suggesting that conservatives consider policies advocated by the Heritage Foundation and the American Enterprise Institute.\n\nAh yes, the Heritage Foundation. Why won\u2019t that rascally President Obama turn to the conservative think tank for ideas about how best to reform the health care system?\n\n[T]he punchline is that Obamacare is largely Heritage\u2019s own invention\u2026. Look out, donors: the policies you pay Heritage to develop today may be policies you pay Heritage to defeat tomorrow. It\u2019s like Victor Frankenstein stumbling over the frozen tundra to defeat the creation he was so proud of but now despises. In this instance Dr. Frankenstein is Stuart Butler, then director of domestic policy research at Heritage and, since 2010, director of Heritage\u2019s Center For Policy Innovation\u2026. [H]e developed two central ideas in Obamacare: an individual mandate requiring everyone to purchase health insurance, and expansion of Medicaid coverage to the working poor.\n\nHeritage also promoted a health care blueprint that relies on exchange marketplaces.\n\nIt\u2019s one of those nagging details conservatives \u2013 and really, the Beltway in general \u2013 doesn\u2019t much like to talk about: the communist, fascist, socialist, freedom-crushing, civilization-destroying \u201cObamacare\u201d was largely based on a model crafted by a conservative think tank and Mitt Romney. When Walker talks about turning to the Heritage Foundation for help on finding a health care reform plan, he\u2019s overlooking the fact that we\u2019ve already done that and it drove conservatives bonkers.\n\nIncidentally, in the same interview, Walker was asked why he rejected Medicaid expansion in Wisconsin. He replied, \u201cFor anyone who says why would you not take it? My answer is simple. I don\u2019t wanna expose the taxpayers in my state to the burden that\u2019s gonna come due when the federal government reneges on their promise.\u201d\n\nSo, Walker is prepared to undermine his own state finances, on purpose, hurt state hospitals, and leave struggling families behind because he thinks the federal government, which is bound by law to pay its bills, will someday fail to reimburse Wisconsin for Medicaid.\n\nIn other words, low-income families will suffer because Scott Walker is \u2026 kind of paranoid.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "The Wisconsin governor thinks we should replace the Affordable Care Act with ideas from the Heritage Foundation.
