The companies also advocated paying lower rates to panel owners who sold them their extra electricity.\n\nDespite the utilities' campaign, the California Public Utilities Commission largely backed the solar industry, which had said the power companies' proposals could have devastated its business.\n\nSIGN UP for the free California Inc. business newsletter >>\n\nUnder the PUC plan, new solar customers would face a one-time fee for connection to the electric grid. The commission estimates that the fee would range from $75 to $150 per solar customer.\n\nIn addition, rooftop solar customers would pay a fee of 2 cents to 3 cents per kilowatt-hour for electricity used from the utility companies, no matter how much power their solar systems generate. This fee would amount to about $5 a month for the average solar user.\n\nUtilities also would place new solar customers on time-of-use rates, which rise during periods of high electricity demand.\n\nExisting owners are exempted from all the changes for 20 years from when they installed their solar systems and connected to the grid.\n\nSara Kamins, supervisor of the PUC's customer generation program, said the proposed changes are designed to get rooftop solar owners to pay their fair share for maintaining the electric system while ensuring that the added fees don't harm solar-panel owners.\n\nThe 2-cent to 3-cent fee, Kamins said, helps to pay for programs such as energy-efficiency efforts that benefit disadvantaged communities.\n\n\u201cWe're still figuring out what a solar customer's fair share is,\u201d Kamins said.\n\nAs for the connection charge \u2014 previously borne by all utility customers \u2014 \u201cWe think they can pay that fee without jeopardizing the economics of the installation,\u201d she said.\n\nThe PUC will accept public comment on the proposed fees through mid-January and is expected to make a final decision at its Jan. 28 meeting.\n\nAt issue is the practice of net metering, in which utilities credit solar users for surplus power their systems create; that electricity gets fed back into the grid for use by other customers. Solar users are credited at the same rate they would pay the utility for electricity.\n\nKamins said the proposed decision leaves the current net metering policy largely intact.\n\nSee more of our top stories on Facebook >>\n\nThe PUC's overhaul of the old solar rules was mandated by the state Legislature, which wanted to encourage the continued growth of rooftop solar installations while spreading costs fairly to all electricity users. The new rules would take effect by July 2017.\n\nUtility proposals called for changes such as crediting solar users at about half the current rates. Utilities also wanted to charge monthly fees based on the size of a homeowner's solar system, which would have been higher than what the commission is proposing.\n\nSouthern California Edison decried the proposed decision as insufficient and unfair to non-solar customers.\n\n\u201cSCE wants rooftop solar to expand in California, and there is a more balanced way to get this done,\u201d said Ron Nichols, Edison's senior vice president of regulatory affairs. \u201cA much more fair approach would maintain some level of subsidy, but at far lower levels, while rooftop solar continues to grow.\u201d\n\nSan Diego Gas & Electric expressed disappointment \u201cthat today's proposed decision on the rooftop solar subsidy does not address the growing cost burden among our customers. Workable solutions must be developed to create a future where all customers can receive benefits.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will continue to engage the CPUC with the hope of finding a better solution than what is in today's proposed decision,\u201d the utility said in a statement\n\nPacific Gas & Electric said the proposed decision \u201cfalls well short of what is needed to ensure sustainable growth of solar.\u201d\n\n\u201cConsumer advocates and environmentalists alike agree that change in solar rates is needed,\u201d Steve Malnight, PG&E's senior vice president of regulatory affairs, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cSome solar company executives will say that the sky is falling if we make any changes, but the truth is that solar's bright future will only be assured by moving forward with smart energy reform. Solar is too important to our state's energy future not to get it right,\u201d Malnight said.\n\nThe debate over California solar costs could shape solar policies throughout the nation as utilities seek ways to tinker with the costs and benefits of solar. Other states look to California as an innovator on solar policy. The state by far leads the nation in deployment of rooftop and utility-scale solar technology, followed by Arizona, New Jersey, North Carolina and Nevada.\n\nOnerous fees could make solar-power systems unaffordable, industry representatives said.\n\nSolar proponents praised the commission's proposed decision and said they looked forward to an even stronger final version for consumers.\n\n\u201cWe support the PUC's proposed decision to continue the state's successful net metering policy,\u201d said Lyndon Rive, chief executive of rooftop solar giant SolarCity. Rive said the proposed decision \u201crecognizes the important role of rooftop solar in accelerating our transition to a clean energy economy and providing customer choice.\n\nBernadette Del Chiaro, director of the California Solar Energy Industries Assn., said: \u201cGov. [Jerry] Brown's PUC is standing up for clean power and for customers by proposing to reject the utilities' attempts to make solar out of reach for customers.\u201d\n\nivan.penn@latimes.com\n\nTwitter: @ivanlpenn\n\nALSO\n\nDeadline to sign up for health coverage extended as applicants flood Obamacare website\n\nCalifornia reaches $26-million settlement with Comcast over electronic waste", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "California regulators propose new rooftop solar fees", "date": "2015-12-15", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "Rooftop solar panel owners could face new fees under a proposal issued Tuesday, but state regulators rejected several recommendations by utility companies that threatened the expansion of residential and commercial solar efforts.", "title": "California regulators propose new rooftop solar fees", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-rooftop-solar-subsidy-20151215-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56706c97/turbine/la-fi-rooftop-solar-subsidy-20151215", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp09.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "rooftop solar, net metering, solar power,", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/85332569", "googlebot-news": "index", "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "news_keywords": "rooftop solar, net metering, solar power,", "y_key": "cee2fe4077f8d050", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "Description": "State regulators proposed new fees Tuesday for rooftop solar customers but rejected several recommendations by utility companies that threatened expansion of residential and commercial solar efforts."}, "article_summary": "Rooftop solar panel owners could face new fees under a proposal issued Tuesday, but state regulators rejected several recommendations by utility companies that threatened the expansion of residential and commercial solar efforts.\n\u201cWe support the PUC's proposed decision to continue the state's successful net metering policy,\u201d said Lyndon Rive, chief executive of rooftop solar giant SolarCity.\nRive said the proposed decision \u201crecognizes the important role of rooftop solar in accelerating our transition to a clean energy economy and providing customer choice.\nThe debate over California solar costs could shape solar policies throughout the nation as utilities seek ways to tinker with the costs and benefits of solar.\nBernadette Del Chiaro, director of the California Solar Energy Industries Assn., said: \u201cGov."}
