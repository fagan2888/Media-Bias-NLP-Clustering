And as we wrap up this stretch, we already get to Cudi\u2019s firing. Coming into this show, Kid Cudi immediately nailed his position as the new cohost: his music is fun, he\u2019s a great sidekick to Scott\u2019s plan and he\u2019s wonderful when he gets to engage in the interviews. After ten episodes, Kid Cudi has excelled in ways that Reggie never did\u2014which is not to say that he\u2019s better, but he\u2019s been a wonderful addition so far on the show. It\u2019s only fitting that the last episode of the summer, \u201cWeird Al Yankovic Wears a Different Hawaiian Shirt,\u201d allows Kid Cudi to play the hero for once, and it\u2019s just as great as everything else he\u2019s done these past ten episodes.\n\nAs Paul F. Tompkins once pointed out, there\u2019s not much of a female audience for Comedy Bang! Bang! because apparently women don\u2019t get high. Since 99% of their audience is male, most of their guests are men, and all late night hosts are men, Scott decides to go for the female audience they\u2019ve been missing out on all these years by rebranding the show The Brew, and turning Comedy Bang! Bang! into an inane morning talk show akin to The View. Scott now has three co-hosts: the peppy leader Madeline Ferrari (Cheri Oteri), the sassy and risqu\u00e9 Terri Herdsman (Nicole Byer) and the conservative mouthpiece Eliza Hansenback (Heather Morris). With these four, Scott no longer needs Kid Cudi, so he asks Cudi to pack up his things, hand over his key cards and his show-issued super soaker and get the hell out.\n\nSometimes I find it problematic when Comedy Bang! Bang! takes on the format of a different type of show. For example, the sitcom parody never did much for me and if this had just been a talk show parody the entire episode, I would\u2019ve probably had similar problems. But of course Comedy Bang! Bang! goes for an insane level of detail in their parody, and adds an extra layer of slight commentary. Every new segment of The Brew feels like an actual program that could exist, if Scott wasn\u2019t playing the Meredith Viera of the show. His sassy comments make him seem almost more at home in this format than on his own show, since he\u2019s free here to make bad puns and slightly naughty jokes to his heart\u2019s content.\n\nHaving Weird Al as the guest is a great choice, as he\u2019s always willing to join Scott on strange adventures on the show and the podcast. The ol Vicar of Yanks understandably finds the comedy segments of The Brew to be unbearable, as they put Weird Al\u2019s hair style on Bill Clinton, Kim Kardashian and Garfield, he calls the bit \u201ccartoonishy lazy.\u201d Weird Al is especially hilarious when he talks about his anti-bullying campaign, which has the terrible catchphrase \u201cIf you\u2019re gonna be mean, I\u2019d rather hang out with a bean.\u201d It\u2019s so dumb out of context, but incredible when said in practice, as a bully comes onto the set and threatens Al and his fan. There\u2019s so much plot happening in this episode that Weird Al doesn\u2019t get too much time, but he makes the most of the time he does get.\n\n\u201cWeird Al\u201d takes a great turn once Cudi comes back to the set to knock some of Scott\u2019s teeth out, for all he\u2019s done to him and discovers Scott\u2019s co-stars are all part of a coven. To be fair, the name The Brew and the suspicious logo should\u2019ve all been dead giveaways. Cudi meets up with The Witchbusters (Joe Nunez, Eugene Cordero and Colton Dunn) to stop the witches\u2019 ultimate goal of switching the sun and the moon, so that all male late night hosts will be relegated to morning shows and women will become the queens of the night. All the witches need for their brew is a virgin, which is precisely why they have Scott.\n\nAs the witches observe, any time a woman takes over a job previously held by a man, they\u2019re witches. The final act takes a faux-misogynistic turn with some terrible, yet hilarious jokes. It\u2019s like when Scott calls the president \u201cBarack Hussein Obamacare\u201d on the podcast, you know he\u2019s having fun in being contrarian and trying to get a rise out of people. So when the witches are stopped because The Witchbusters do the one thing that every husbandless woman wants more than anything and propose to the witches, it\u2019s so perfect in its awfulness. This continues with Scott\u2019s final speech, where he says that women can\u2019t be late night hosts because they\u2019re just too sleepy from spending their days looking for husbands, making homes and letting babies suckle at their ample teets\u2014they\u2019re too tired to tell jokes and interview celebrities.\n\nAs Comedy Bang! Bang! wraps up its summer episodes, it ends at the top of its game. Scott and Cudi are a great team and the show has now nailed every aspect of its show and know how to pull each bit off incredibly well. Comedy Bang! Bang! now knows how to make every interview, every pre-recorded bit and every ambitious episode work to its benefit. Comedy Bang! Bang! has become a well-oiled machine that rarely falters and it\u2019s only getting better.\n\nRoss Bonaime is a D.C.-based freelance writer and regular contributor to Paste.
