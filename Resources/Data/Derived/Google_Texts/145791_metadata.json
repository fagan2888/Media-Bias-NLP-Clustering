We\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrandon took the helm at Toys \u201cR\u201d Us earlier this year, aiming to turn around the world\u2019s largest retail chain devoted to toys. The company was taken private by Bain Capital Partners, KKR & Co., and Vornado Realty Trust in a $6.6 billion deal in 2005. Since then, the rise of Web competitors like Amazon.com Inc. hampered its performance, leading it to cancel plans for an initial public offering two years ago.\n\nRevenue has dropped in each of the past three years, including during the holidays. So this Christmas is an important test for the retailer under Brandon. He\u2019s also stepping up investments in e-commerce, aiming to better cope with Amazon and other online rivals.\n\nThe company has been stocking more inventory of the industry\u2019s biggest brands, like Star Wars, than in past years. Games like Hasbro Inc.\u2019s Pie Face helped fuel sales during Thanksgiving, Brandon said on Friday.", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "4.1.1373663871", "eomportal-id": 409700, "description": "Toys \u201cR\u201d Us Inc. chief executive Dave Brandon said the toy industry isn\u2019t putting up the kind of growth numbers that some predicted this holiday season.", "eomportal-instanceid": 14, "og": {"site_name": "BostonGlobe.com", "description": "Toys \u201cR\u201d Us Inc. chief executive Dave Brandon said the toy industry isn\u2019t putting up the kind of growth numbers that some predicted this holiday season.", "title": "Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us CEO sees slower sales growth for toys - The Boston Globe", "url": "https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2015/11/28/toys-ceo-sees-slower-sales-growth-for-toys/qeWYNWaBY5FhTrPCqspNWP/story.html", "image": "http://c.o0bg.com/rf/image_585w/Boston/2011-2020/2015/11/27/BostonGlobe.com/Business/Images/af5b8f86-09db-4ae7-be2e-f420c49464a0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 95431448, "card": "summary", "site": "BostonGlobe"}, "robots": "noarchive", "news_keywords": "Bloomberg Business News, Bloomberg LP, NPD Group, Bain Capital, Vornado Realty Trust, Amazon.com Inc, Hasbro Incorporated,Vornado Realty Trust|VNO|NYSE, Amazon.com Inc|AMZN|NASDAQ, Hasbro Incorporated|HAS|NYSE", "eomportal-lastUpdate": "Thu May 26 18:05:29 EDT 2016", "fb": {"admins": 507486035, "app_id": 103933749691726, "pages": 5637143257}, "keywords": "Bloomberg Business News, Bloomberg LP, NPD Group, Bain Capital, Vornado Realty Trust, Amazon.com Inc, Hasbro Incorporated,Vornado Realty Trust|VNO|NYSE, Amazon.com Inc|AMZN|NASDAQ, Hasbro Incorporated|HAS|NYSE", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/globe"}, "flashsale": "false", "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "eomportal-uuid": "05b6a2da-958b-11e5-87cf-950558c7aa72"}, "article_summary": "\u201cMy preliminary view is we\u2019re not seeing 6 percent to 7 percent category growth,\u201d Brandon said in an interview.\nGames like Hasbro Inc.\u2019s Pie Face helped fuel sales during Thanksgiving, Brandon said on Friday.\nToys \u201cR\u201d Us Inc. chief executive Dave Brandon said the toy industry isn\u2019t putting up the kind of growth numbers that some predicted this holiday season.\nWe\u2019ll see.\u201dAdvertisementBrandon took the helm at Toys \u201cR\u201d Us earlier this year, aiming to turn around the world\u2019s largest retail chain devoted to toys.\nShoppers at the Toys \u201cR\u201d Us in Times Square in New York on Thanksgiving Day."}
