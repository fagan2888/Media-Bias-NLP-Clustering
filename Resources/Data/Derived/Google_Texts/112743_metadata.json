The PRP market was valued at $45 million in 2009, and it is expected to grow to $126 million by 2016.\n\nYet the question remains: Does it work? The evidence remains questionable.\n\nIn April, the Cochrane Collaborative, a group of independent medical experts, examined 19 trials of PRP for eight conditions and concluded that the evidence is insufficient to recommend PRP for soft-tissue injuries.\n\nA PRP treatment begins with a blood draw from the patient. Next, the blood is spun to separate platelets from the other blood cells. The process creates a solution of concentrated platelets and growth factors that is injected into the injured area to promote healing.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know if it helps people,\u201d says Frederick Azar, president of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. \u201cThe clinical evidence is controversial.\u201d\n\nSome studies show a benefit, he says; some don\u2019t.\n\nThe Cochrane review found that most studies are small and not definitive. The wide variety of methods used to deliver PRP and the absence of a standard methodology may explain why studies have reached such different results, Azar says.\n\nDespite the lack of standardization and definitive evidence, PRP is used to treat a wide range of maladies, including chronic tendon injuries, acute muscle and ligament injuries, osteoarthritis of the knee, and to speed recovery from surgery and fractures.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have enough information to show that it works, but we believe it has great potential to work,\u201d Azar says. \u201cThere\u2019s little downside or risk that would prohibit us from offering this.\u201d\n\nSome patients might point to the cost \u2014 from $500 to $1,200 for a single treatment \u2014 as a downside. Most insurance companies won\u2019t pay, since the treatment is experimental.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t stop doctors and clinics from marketing PRP to patients, some of whom are desperate to return to their previous activities.\n\n\u201cThis is one of those things that falls between the cracks,\u201d says Karen Maschke, a bioethics scholar at the Hastings Center, because PRP doesn\u2019t fall under the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s jurisdiction. Patients have to rely on their physician to \u201cdo no harm,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cOrthopedic medicine has a long history of pushing procedures and devices that don\u2019t fall under FDA regulation,\u201d Maschke says. \u201cThey\u2019re engaging in entrepreneurial medicine.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2014/07/Sharapova-1.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2d14\"", "article_summary": "A PRP treatment begins with a blood draw from the patient.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have enough information to show that it works, but we believe it has great potential to work,\u201d Azar says.\nThe PRP market was valued at $45 million in 2009, and it is expected to grow to $126 million by 2016.\nBut that doesn\u2019t stop doctors and clinics from marketing PRP to patients, some of whom are desperate to return to their previous activities.\n\u201cOrthopedic medicine has a long history of pushing procedures and devices that don\u2019t fall under FDA regulation,\u201d Maschke says."}
