That payment is required for people to actually be enrolled and eligible for health benefits under the plans.\n\nConnecticut, whose Obamacare marketplace has been seen as a star of the state-run exchanges, leads the pack in paid enrollments. In the Nutmeg State, 92 percent of its 57,465 Obamacare sign-ups have coughed up the cash to make their enrollment official.\n\n\"It's never going to be 100 percent,\" said Kevin Counihan, CEO of Access Health CT, the state's marketplace.

The state's exchange, which has been a technological disaster, saw just 54 percent of enrollees paying for their first premiums as of March 1.\n\n\n\nThe exchanges operated by Washington state and Vermont also failed to crack 60 percent.\n\nFive states that run their own Obamacare exchanges are not releasing the paid rate for the Obamacare exchanges they operate. And Massachusetts only reports paid enrollments; it does not report totals of people who have signed up for plans, meaning that the paid rate is unknown.\n\n\n\n(Read more: Obamacare's problem: Can't fix stupid)\n\n\n\nInsurance experts estimate that nationwide, anywhere between 15 percent and 20 percent of Obamacare enrollees haven't paid.", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "cnbcnewsstory", "description": "Nine states and the District of Columbia have been releasing their paid Obamacare enrollment rates even as the federal government withholds such data.", "author": "Dan Mangan, Jodi Gralnick", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "Nine states and the District of Columbia have been releasing their paid Obamacare enrollment rates even as the federal government withholds such data.", "title": "All over the map: States' 'paid' Obamacare rates", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2014/03/14/all-over-the-map-states-paid-obamacare-rates.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2014/03/14/101496170-92119681.1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Nine states and the District of Columbia have been releasing their paid Obamacare enrollment rates even as the federal government withholds such data.", "title": "All over the map: States' 'paid' Obamacare rates", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2014/03/14/all-over-the-map-states-paid-obamacare-rates.html", "image": {"src": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2014/03/14/101496170-92119681.1910x1000.jpg"}, "creator": "@_DanMangan", "site": "@CNBC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"app_name": "CNBC Business News and Finance", "app_store_id": 398018310}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=398018310", "GOOGLEBOT": "unavailable_after: 31 Dec 9999 23:59:59 GMT", "keywords": "Health Care, Health Care, US: News, Politics, Obamacare, business news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnbc", "published_time": "2014-03-14T15:37:44-0400", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/CNBC", "section": "Health Care", "modified_time": "2014-03-14T16:29:08-0400", "tag": "Obamacare"}, "pageNodeId": 101495242, "news_keywords": "Obamacare, insurance, nine states, paid enrollment, data, rates, DC"}, "article_summary": "Five states that run their own Obamacare exchanges are not releasing the paid rate for the Obamacare exchanges they operate.\n(Read more: House GOP wants Obamacare payment data)Minnesota is in second place, with 90 percent of enrollees paid.\n(Read more: Obamacare's problem: Can't fix stupid)Insurance experts estimate that nationwide, anywhere between 15 percent and 20 percent of Obamacare enrollees haven't paid.\nAnd Massachusetts only reports paid enrollments; it does not report totals of people who have signed up for plans, meaning that the paid rate is unknown.\nEven as federal officials catch heat for not disclosing how many Obamacare enrollees nationwide have actually paid their first insurance premiums, nine states and the District of Columbia have been releasing such data publicly."}
