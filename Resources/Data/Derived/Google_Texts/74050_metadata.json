The organization has about 1,000 members, comprised mostly of immigrants from mainland China residing now in different parts of the U.S, from Nebraska to Pennsylvania to New York to, of course, California.\n\nThe group was founded just two days after Trump declared his presidential run in June by 32-year-old David Wang, a boyish-looking Beijing transplant who now lives in the city of Diamond Bar with his family. Wang caught a YouTube video of someone making fun of Trump, and that plunged him down a rabbit hole. He ended up spending the next five hours devouring clips of the man. The more Wang watched, the more he found himself liking the Donald \u2013 not just as a politician, but as a person.\n\nHis reasons aren\u2019t all that different from Trump\u2019s other supporters: The promise of jobs and prosperity embodied in the figure of a plain-speaking DC outsider who also happens to be crazy rich.\n\n\u201cSome of his message I don\u2019t particularly support, but I like 99 percent of his message,\u201d Wang says, such as Trump\u2019s stance against undocumented immigration \u2013 including his threat to ban all Muslims from entering the U.S.\n\nEven Trump\u2019s rebuke of China \u2013 for taking away U.S. jobs and for manipulating its currency, the yuan \u2013 has done little to dampen Wang\u2019s enthusiasm. His cohorts feel the same way, like Lilly Wang (no relation to David), a mother and a small business owner in the San Gabriel Valley. She voted for President Obama in 2008, but became disillusioned by the Affordable Care Act and the White House's policy on LGBTQ rights.\n\n\u201cObamacare is a concern of mine. For a lot of us in the middle class it\u2019s way too expensive. We basically can\u2019t afford it, particularly us small business owners,\u201d Lilly Wang says.\n\nThat sense of disappointment with the Democratic Party permeates the group. If anything, it goes to show that the long-held assumption that Chinese Americans will always lean blue politically might no longer be a given, despite the fact that close to three out of four Asian American voters supported President Obama in 2012.\n\nMark Ma, an IT consultant who learned about \u201cChinese Americans for Trump\u201d just days ago, says the difference might be generational.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably because of education and socioeconomic status,\u201d says Ma.\n\nMany in the current wave of new Chinese immigrants are better off, Ma explains, saying that the issues that matter to them are dovetailing more with the values of the Republican Party \u2013 like taxes.\n\n\u201cThe older generation mostly fled from war or unrest, they might be unskilled labor and stuff like that,\" says Ma.\n\nThe group has a big day on their calendar next week. They're scheduled to meet Trump himself next week when he is in town. It's certainly one thing organizer David Wang can cross off his bucket list. But his eyes, like Trump\u2019s, are on the biggest prize. And then, Wang reasons, Trump will change his rhetoric on China.\n\n\"He\u2019s just running for president right now. He\u2019s not the president right now yet, but he will be. When he becomes president , he\u2019ll change his views,\" Wang says. \"Trump is a very smart man, and he will definitely find an equilibrium among foreign policy and economics with China.\"\n\nBut what if Trump doesn\u2019t win? It\u2019s not a reality Wang deigns to entertain, so certain is he that his candidate of choice will prevail.\n\nNo matter what, \u201cI\u2019ll still be a Republican going forward, for sure,\u201d Wang says.", "article_metadata": {"author": "Southern California Public Radio", "og": {"site_name": "Southern California Public Radio", "description": "Yes, they exist.
