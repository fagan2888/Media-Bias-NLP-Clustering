The Betty Ford Center was named for former President Gerald Ford's wife and is widely recognized as the rehab facility for celebrities.\n\nHazelden, the older of the two institutions, is highly respected in the rehab community for its training and education programs, as well as its treatment system. Both facilities employ 12-step abstinence-based recovery regimens.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation, anticipating greater demand for outpatient addiction treatment at a facility already at capacity, is breaking ground this week on a significant expansion of its St.", "og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "The Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation, anticipating greater demand for outpatient addiction treatment at a facility already at capacity, is breaking ground this week on a significant expansion of its St.", "title": "Hazelden starting major St. Paul expansion", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/hazelden-starting-major-st-paul-expansion/261709411/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/1HAZELDEN060414.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/1HAZELDEN060414.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation, anticipating greater demand for outpatient addiction treatment at a facility already at capacity, is breaking ground this week on a significant expansion of its St.", "title": "Hazelden starting major St. Paul expansion", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/hazelden-starting-major-st-paul-expansion/261709411/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/1HAZELDEN060414.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/1HAZELDEN060414.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "article": {"tag": "addiction"}, "news_keywords": "betty ford,Hazelden,St. Paul,addiction"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1979\"", "article_summary": "The Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation, anticipating greater demand for outpatient addiction treatment at a facility already at capacity, is breaking ground this week on a significant expansion of its St. Paul campus.\nThe Betty Ford Center was named for former President Gerald Ford's wife and is widely recognized as the rehab facility for celebrities.\nHazelden, based in Center City, 45 miles northeast of Minneapolis, combined with the California-based Betty Ford Center to create a network that spans 15 care sites in nine states.\nThe Fellowship Club was established in 1953 with the mission to help addicts return to their everyday lives.\nFoundation President and CEO Mark Mishek, Fellowship Club Executive Director Terri Hayden and foundation spokesman William Moyers will be attending."}
