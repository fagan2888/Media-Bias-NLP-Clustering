An armed suspect was arrested Saturday morning after briefly barricading himself in a home in eastern El Paso County, authorities say.

El Paso County Sheriff’s deputies had set up a perimeter around the mobile home on the 1300 block of 8th Street in Calhan, which is east of Colorado Springs.

Officials talked the 50-year-old man out of the home and he is being held on suspicion of menacing and reckless endangerment, said Jacqueline Kirby, spokeswoman for the El Paso County Sheriff’s Department.

An emergency call was made Saturday morning about a suspect who was menacing someone with a gun, Kirby said.
