Rick Nolan again in 2016.\n\nNolan defeated Mills by less than 1.5 percentage points in 2014 in Minnesota\u2019s 8th Congressional District. It was the closest congressional contest in the state last year.\n\nMills said he thinks Nolan is vulnerable because of his support for the Affordable Care Act, which Mills contends has increased health care costs. He also said Nolan\u2019s support for the nuclear deal with Iran is a problem.\n\n\u201cThe issues, some of them are the same, but there are even more issues this time that are causing me to get off the bench again and get into the game,\u201d Mills said.\n\nMills said he plans to formally announce his campaign in October.\n\nHe said he will have higher name identification after running once. And because Minnesota does not have a Senate race or governor\u2019s race on the ballot in 2016, Mills said the race will be focused on the congressional seat.\n\n\u201cLast time, with Al Franken winning by double digits and Rick Nolan winning by less than 1.4 percent, it\u2019s not so much that Rick Nolan won the election as so much as he rode Al Franken\u2019s coattails,\u201d Mills said.\n\nBut 2016 is a presidential year, which has boosted voter turnout for Democrats in the northeastern Minnesota district.\n\nThe Nolan-Mills race in 2014 was one of the most closely watched contests in the country. The candidates and outside groups spent more than $12 million on the contest.\n\nBut in 2016 the open seat in the 2nd District where Rep. John Kline is not seeking re-election is expected to draw national money away from less competitive races.\n\nMills, who is partial owner of Mills Fleet Farm, said he intends to spend his own money on the race.\n\nNolan said he intends to run for re-election.\n\n\u201cThe congressman is with constituents right now with Pope Francis, so we will reserve our comments until Mr. Mills formally announces,\u201d said Nolan spokesman Justin Perpich.", "article_metadata": {"mpr-content-group": "capitol-view", "mpr-collection": "Politics", "WT.cg_n": "News Blogs", "WT.z_mpr-site": "news", "description": "The Nolan-Mills race in 2014 was one of the most closely watched contests in the country.", "author": "Tom Scheck", "og": {"site_name": "Capitol View", "description": "The Nolan-Mills race in 2014 was one of the most closely watched contests in the country.", "title": "Mills to make another run at Rep.
