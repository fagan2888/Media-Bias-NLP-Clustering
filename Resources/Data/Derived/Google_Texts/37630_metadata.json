Now it\u2019s how Hitler reacted when he learned that Chuck Norris had been unleashed on the Third Reich.\n\n\u201cDo you realize what Chuck Norris is? I\u2019ll tell you what Chuck Norris,\u201d Hitler shrieks. \u201cIf Chuck Norris gets shot today, tomorrow will be the bullet\u2019s funeral! It\u2019s said he can win a staring contest with the sun. When Chuck Norris\u2019 fever broke global warming was solved. Chuch Norris puts the \u2018laughter\u2019 in \u2018slaughter.\u2019 And he can squeeze water from rocks!\u201d\n\nThe scene has become the source of numerous political and pop-culture parodies.\n\nIt comes from a Hitler rant in the 2004 German-language movie \u201cDownfall,\u201d which recounts the Nazi dictator\u2019s final days in his Berlin bunker.\n\nIn the new parody, Hitler\u2019s advisers are informing him how various superheroes are challenging his supremacy.\n\n\u201cMere child\u2019s play,\u201d Hitler said. \u201cOur kryptonite-clad Nazi ninjas will push them back.\u201d\n\nThen he\u2019s told: \u201cWe\u2019ve just learned the U.S. has deployed their Chuck Norris on us. He swims the Atlantic as we speak.\u201d\n\nThe rant follows.\n\nHitler says: \u201cThe most traumatic day of my life was not when I learned Santa Claus wasn\u2019t real but was when I learned Chuck Norris was. He does all his grocery shopping at Home Depot. He was to die five years ago, but Death can\u2019t muster the courage to tell him.\u201d\n\nThe scene from \u201cDownfall\u201d also has played on objections to Obamacare:\n\nThe video was posted after more than 6 million Americans received notice that their health insurance plans had been canceled because of Obamacare.\n\nPreviously WND reported on another parody using the same film clip.\n\nIn it, \u201cHitler\u201d blasted the government for its inability to build a website that would allow Americans to quickly sign up for the federal health care program.\n\n\u201cJust tell them to sign up with the Obamacare exchange at Healthcare.gov,\u201d Hitler says.\n\n\u201cNo one can get logged on. \u2026 The website is a joke,\u201d he is told.\n\nThen he erupts in anger.\n\nAnother Hitler parody has the dictator planning to interrupt Obama\u2019s State of the Union speech:\n\nNorris has been writing a weekly column exclusively for WND since Oct. 23, 2006. The star of \u201cWalker: Texas Ranger\u201d and some of the biggest action pictures ever, Norris has also reached a new generation as part of the Internet craze for one-liners usually labeled not as jokes but as \u201cfacts.\u201d\n\nIn \u201cThe Official Chuck Norris Fact Book,\u201d Norris gives readers not only his favorite \u201cfacts,\u201d roundhouse-kicked by the man himself, but also the stories behind the facts and the code by which he lives his life.\n\nIn his bestselling book \u201cBlack Belt Patriotism: How to Reawaken America,\u201d Norris provides real solutions for solving the nation\u2019s problems, moving the country forward and changing its course for the better.\n\nAs history shows, millions of Americans follow when Chuck Norris leads.\n\nIn 2008, Zeta Interactive confirmed that when Norris endorsed former Arkansas Gov. Huckabee in a WND column, it sparked a 66 percent increase in Internet posts on Huckabee.\n\nWhen Norris wrote of his endorsement of Huckabee, the former governor was holding support from about 8 percent of voters, according to Rasmussen Reports, which is considered one of the most accurate tracking polls. Within a couple days, the time it took for the Norris column to make the rounds of the blogs and media sites, Huckabee\u2019s support rose to 10 percent, his first time ever in double digits, and within another day it was at 12 percent. Huckabee\u2019s campaign also reported a surge in campaign contributions in just days after the Norris endorsement.\n\nNorris\u2019 career began not in movies, television or in the world of Internet trivia. The man who has employed martial arts in so many of his pictures first came to the world\u2019s attention as a real-life martial arts star. He was a six-time undefeated World Professional MiddleWeight Karate Champion. He was also a renowned teacher in the martial arts, with celebrity students including Steve McQueen, Bob Barker, Priscilla Presley and Donnie and Marie Osmond.\n\nHe has gone on to found the United Fighting Arts Federation with more than 2,300 black belts all over the world. In 1997, Norris achieved another milestone by becoming the first man ever in the Western Hemisphere to be awarded an eighth-degree Black Belt Grand Master recognition in the Tae Kwon Do system. It was a first in 4,500 years of tradition.\n\nThe Norrises say that next to their family, their greatest mission in life is their KICKSTART KIDS Foundation. In 1992, with the help of President George H.W. Bush, the program was launched in four public middle schools in Houston.\n\nFor over 20 years, KICKSTART KIDS has developed and delivered an in-school physical education program based on martial arts that teaches responsibility and character development, while building self-esteem and engaging kids in a school-based activity. The program is dedicated to giving middle school students the tools and support necessary to resolve conflicts, avoid participating in gangs, choose a drug-free lifestyle, resist negative peer pressure, remain in school until they graduate, achieve a higher level of academic success and ultimately become productive members of our communities.\n\nToday KSK serves more than 7,000 children daily and has graduated approximately 70,000 students, with many going on to college.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "It was how \u201cAdolf Hitler\u201d reacted when Obamacare was invoked, when Obama won re-election in 2012 and much more.
