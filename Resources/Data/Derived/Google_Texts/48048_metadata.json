Meet the new kid on the block, Brock Osweiler. He\u2019s 1-0 against you. That\u2019s how legends are born.\n\nOn a wicked-cold, snow-swept Sunday night, Denver kicked the Patriots in the gut with a 30-24 overtime victory. As C.J. Anderson crossed the goal line after a 48-yard run for the game-winning touchdown, 75,617 Broncomaniacs in the stadium screamed a message to New England:\n\nWe\u2019re tougher than you!\n\nPHOTOS: Best snow photos from the Broncos win over the Patriots\n\nThis victory was exactly what John Elway wanted to see, a Broncos team kicking and screaming to the bitter end. Football does not get any grittier, any tenser or any more personal than this classic game in which New England twice built leads of 14 points but the Broncos kept coming back.\n\n\u201cI love the way they compete,\u201d Denver coach Gary Kubiak said. \u201cThey continue to battle. \u2026 This league is about overcoming adversity.\u201d\n\nThat the biggest Denver victory of the season happened on a miserable evening, when the temperature dropped to 16 degrees, with an injured Peyton Manning sitting inside a warm locker room, is a reality that must be addressed. There is nothing except the utmost respect for Manning, but even if his aching foot, dented ribs and all the other ailments that beset a 39-year-old quarterback eventually heal, he will return as the backup to Osweiler.\n\nPEYTON MANNING: Watches Broncos win over Patriots from the locker area\n\nIf jobs are won on the basis of the scoreboard rather than reputation, then the Broncos are Osweiler\u2019s team from now through the end of the playoffs.\n\nThe hurry-hurry offense built to Manning\u2019s specifications was a shiny, red Lamborghini. What Kubiak drives is a 1977 Ford Bronco with a crack in the windshield and rusty bumper. So tell me: Which one travels better in the snow? Or is better equipped to survive the nasty pot holes of January on the road to the Super Bowl?\n\nThis is Kubiak football. It ain\u2019t pretty. But it hangs around like a bad cold that a foe cannot shake. \u201cWe preached at halftime that physical was still going to win the football game and ultimately it did,\u201d Kubiak said.\n\nIn all likelihood, Osweiler will never match the number of Super Bowl rings, the fame or the fortune enjoyed by Brady. But it did not matter that New England entered this game with a 10-0 record and a chance to all but guarantee the No. 1 seed for the AFC playoffs. On this night, it was Osweiler that led the fourth-quarter comeback and outplayed Brady when it mattered the most.\n\nHow was Denver tougher?\n\nLet us count the ways. The Broncos ran the ball 32 times for 179 yards. Safety Darian Stewart knocked New England tight end Rob Gronkowski from the game. With Manning and linebacker DeMarcus Ware already missing with injury, Denver lost the services of defenders T.J. Ward and Sylvester Williams on one play but kept fighting.\n\nINJURIES: Broncos lose three starters in snowy game vs. Patriots\n\nAt the end of a night that will be long remembered in Broncos Country, there was Patriots coach Bill Belichick, looking as grumpy as a guy stuck shoveling for hours, while those snot-nosed neighbor kids pelt him with snowballs.\n\n\u201cI remember when I was a kid, you\u2019d go in the backyard and play football in the winter, and if your receiver didn\u2019t catch it, the ball would go in a snow bank,\u201d said Osweiler, who did throw 23 passes that teammates caught, good for 270 yards and a touchdown, including a 4-yard pass to Andre Caldwell that put the Broncos ahead 24-21 with 1:09 remaining in the fourth quarter.\n\nThis does not figure to be the last time that Denver and New England meet during the 2015 NFL season. This could be the start of a beautiful new rivalry between Osweiler and Brady. This victory, while huge for the Broncos, will pale when compared to the stakes on the line in a playoff matchup that feels like destiny.\n\nNew England is the more talented team, with a championship pedigree that\u2019s undeniable. The Broncos, however, are the tougher team. They kick. They scream. They never surrender.\n\nBOXSCORE: Broncos 30, Patriots 24 (OT)", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Kiszla: The legend of Brock Osweiler begins", "title": "Kiszla: The legend of Brock Osweiler begins", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/11/29/kiszla-the-legend-of-brock-osweiler-begins/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg", "height": 512}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-29T23:40:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-23T02:09:50+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Mark Kiszla"}, "article_summary": "On a wicked-cold, snow-swept Sunday night, Denver kicked the Patriots in the gut with a 30-24 overtime victory.\nThis does not figure to be the last time that Denver and New England meet during the 2015 NFL season.\nPHOTOS: Best snow photos from the Broncos win over the PatriotsThis victory was exactly what John Elway wanted to see, a Broncos team kicking and screaming to the bitter end.\nOn this night, it was Osweiler that led the fourth-quarter comeback and outplayed Brady when it mattered the most.\nIn all likelihood, Osweiler will never match the number of Super Bowl rings, the fame or the fortune enjoyed by Brady."}
