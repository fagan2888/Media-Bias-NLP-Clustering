Area students competed in an American History essay contest for fifth through eighth grade, and the Good Citizen essay contest for high school seniors.\n\nFor the American History contest, students are eligible to submit essays through their school. They are sent to the Elbridge Gerry chapter and judged by non-DAR member judges. One student is selected from each grade level for the chapter winners. These essays are submitted to Colorado State DAR for state level judging. They are judged on historical accuracy, originality, adherence to topic, organization of material, interest, spelling, grammar, punctuation and neatness.\n\nThe American History Daughters of the American Revolution essays winners were honored at a patriotic reception.
