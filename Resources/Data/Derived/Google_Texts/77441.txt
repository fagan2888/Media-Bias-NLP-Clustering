Spotlight on… Andre Miller, point guard, Kings

When: This was the first week back after the prolonged all-star break, and because NBA teams played just one game during the evaluation period, we’re going another route with The Denver Post’s player of the week award. Sacramento Kings point guard Andre Miller gets it for being reunited with the coach he loves most.

What’s up: Last year, an upset Miller lashed out at Nuggets coach Brian Shaw. This year, a quieter Miller languished on Washington’s bench. But the one thing that could possibly save his sanity actually happened — George Karl got another job in the NBA. Karl’s first order of business was to get his security blanket: Andre Miller. The Kings acquired him Thursday before the league’s trade deadline.

Background: Miller has always been the player Karl could agree on. Karl sulked in 2006 when the Nuggets dealt Miller to Philadelphia as part of the Allen Iverson trade. Karl celebrated in 2011 when Miller was reacquired by Denver.

Dempsey’s take: Miller is 38 years old. If he has only a couple of seasons left in the NBA, it’s fitting they be spent playing for the coach who has always respected his game most. “He knows how to deal with players and egos,” Miller said of Karl, “and that’s why he’s been so successful in this league.” It was a veiled comment poking at his previous, most recent, situations. But the lob pass is back. Miller and Karl are together again. All is right in the NBA.
