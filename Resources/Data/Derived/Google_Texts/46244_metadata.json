It's turning the Reagan coalition of Reagan Democrats into a permanent fact of American life. No wonder Schumer is making squeaking noises about ObamaCare and the middle class.\n\nObama's job approval rating among white non-college graduates is at 27% so far in 2014, 14 percentage points lower than among white college graduates. This is the largest yearly gap between these two groups since Obama took office. These data underscore the magnitude of the Democratic Party's problem with working-class whites, among whom Obama lost in the 2012 presidential election, and among whom Democratic House candidates lost in the 2014 U.S. House voting by 30 points.\n\nApparently if you wreck the health care coverage of working people who aren't in love with you as a role model or history barrier breaker, they'll turn on you. They'll turn on you really hard.\n\nObama's overall job approval rating has dropped throughout the first six years of his administration, and this downward trajectory is seen both among white Americans who are college graduates and those who are not. But the gap between his approval ratings among college-educated and non-college-educated whites has grown. It was six points in 2009, when Obama had the overall highest ratings of his administration, then expanded to 10 points in 2010 and to 12 points in 2013. The gap between these two groups is at its highest yet, at 14 points so far this year. Whites in general constitute a political challenge for Democrats and the president given their Republican orientation, as evidenced by Obama's job approval ratings so far this year of 84% among blacks, 64% among Asians, 53% among Hispanics and 32% among whites. About two-thirds of adult whites have not graduated from college, making working-class whites a particularly important group politically because of its sheer size.\n\nThis is a group that Republicans can build a national coalition around if the establishment ever figured out how to count its toes, let alone how to count its voters.", "article_metadata": {"rating": "general", "description": "Obama's job approval rating among white non-college graduates is at 27%", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Frontpage Mag", "description": "Obama's job approval rating among white non-college graduates is at 27%", "title": "Working Class White People Like Ebola More Than Obama", "url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/point/246311/working-class-white-people-ebola-more-obama-daniel-greenfield", "updated_time": "2015-06-22T23:42:53-04:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/point/246311/working-class-white-people-ebola-more-obama-daniel-greenfield", "description": "Obama's job approval rating among white non-college graduates is at 27%", "card": "summary", "title": "Working Class White People Like Ebola More Than Obama"}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-29T03:08:20-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-22T23:42:53-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccfff\"", "article_summary": "Obama's job approval rating among white non-college graduates is at 27% so far in 2014, 14 percentage points lower than among white college graduates.\nThe Democratic Party has a major problem with working class white people.\nBut the gap between his approval ratings among college-educated and non-college-educated whites has grown.\nThis is the largest yearly gap between these two groups since Obama took office.\nThe gap between these two groups is at its highest yet, at 14 points so far this year."}
