Four Iraqi children under the age of 15 were recently beheaded by ISIS for refusing to Islam.

The children were affiliated with Iraq’s lone Anglican church. Canon Andrew White, known as “The Vicar of Baghdad” until he was forced to flee to Israel in October, recounted the story in an interview with the Orthodox Christian Network:

Islamic State turned up and said to the children, “you say the words that you will follow Mohammad”’, he said, his voice cracking with emotion. ‘The children, all under 15, four of them, said “no, we love Yesua; we have always loved Yesua; we have always followed Yesua; Yesua has always been with us”. ‘They [ISIS] said, “Say the words.” They [the children] said, “No, we can’t”. ‘They chopped all their heads off. How do you respond to that? You just cry.

All of this tells us two things. It tell us just how evil ISIS is. But it also tells us how brave those children were in refusing to give up their faith even though they knew they were about to die.
