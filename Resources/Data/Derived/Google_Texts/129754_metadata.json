Asa Hutchinson \u2014 which would have funded his Medicaid expansion program \u2014 from passing. It's our hope that our local representation look to be a voice of their constituents moving forward.\n\nSen. Bryan King, who represents Madison County (as well as Carroll County) in the Arkansas Legislature, did an about-face recently, telling The Record (April 7 edition) he wants to see an increase in funding for the Department of Human Services\u2019 (DHS) Division of Children and Family Services (DCFS), while making comments last week that directly contradict that statement.\n\nLast week, King said during the fiscal session in Little Rock that DHS had issues with \u201cwaste, fraud, and abuse,\u201d and that some funding for the department should be cut.\n\nAt a press conference on Wednesday, Hutchinson told reporters that senators should be mindful of the consequences to their districts if the department faced cuts as a result of not supporting the governor\u2019s Medicaid expansion, a program called Arkansas Works, which was approved by legislators in a special session earlier this month. Some of the senators didn\u2019t heed the advice of Hutchinson \u2013 who we feel is the voice of reason on this issue \u2013 and voted in the fiscal session last week against funding Arkansas Works, which would have granted $8.4 billion in spending authority for state and federal funds, including $1.7 billion for Medicaid expansion, to the DHS\u2019 Medicaid Services Division in fiscal 2017. It was two votes short of the required 27 it needed (three-fourths of the 35-member senate), and Sen. King was among the 10 senators voting against it. Rep. Bob Ballinger (R-Hindsvile) has also voiced opposition to the Medicaid expansion, promising on Tuesday a lawsuit if Hutchinson uses a line-item veto to ensure the program\u2019s funding.\n\nThough the senate voted down funding the Medicaid expansion contained in SB 121, the legislature did earlier this month pass the Arkansas Works program, which is an extension of the Health Care Independence Program (also known as the private option), which will terminate on Dec. 31 of this year. The program enacted by the state three years ago was Arkansas\u2019 solution to the federal Affordable Care Act, choosing to opt in to the private option to insure more than 266,000 impoverished Arkansans. The Arkansas Works program, should it receive funding, would continue that coverage.\n\nThe continuance of that program \u2013 which is currently federally funded, but would next year see the state taking on 5 percent of the premium costs and 10 percent by 2020 \u2013 would also generate revenue for the state in the form of taxation on premiums, as well as save the state money from covering medical costs for uninsured citizens who now have coverage through the private option. Should the program fail to receive funding, not only would those 266,000 Arkansans lose their insurance, but it\u2019s estimated that the state budget would face a shortfall \u2013 $100 million on the low end, more than $200 million on the high.\n\nThat shortfall would of course result in a series of cuts throughout the state budget, many of which would be incurred through education and DHS. House Speaker Jeremy Gillam (R-Judsonia) released an alternative budget that doesn\u2019t include the Medicaid expansion plan, but compared to the proposed budget with the Arkansas Works program, does offer $31 million less to the state\u2019s public school fund and nearly $11 million less toward DCFS. (The bill Hutchinson proposed offers $91,537,075 to the division; Gillam\u2019s offers $80,600,000.)\n\nHutchinson has publicly stated that failure to fund Arkansas Works will result in the loss of several services and amenities throughout the state \u2013 not just the state\u2019s highways, but particularly in the case of DCFS, he stated in a release, \u201cIn order to achieve a $10.9 million reduction, DHS would be forced to cut the current number of DCFS staff by approximately 255 positions \u2013 168 caseworkers and investigators, 31 supervisors and 56 program assistants. Those cuts would cause average caseloads to go from 29 to 48.\u201d\n\nHutchinson continues by stating: \u201cThe consequences of this cut alone is devastating and will directly impact the resources available for our foster families, our social workers and nearly 5,000 children in our state\u2019s foster care system. Adequate funding and handling of our state\u2019s foster care community is an important initiative of my administration. To further cut funding for DCFS is a disservice to the foster care community and to the children who so desperately need our help.\u201d\n\nThe last thing Madison County needs is more cuts to programs funded through DHS.\n\nLast year, Rick Pippin a representative from the DCFS, made several stops in Madison County, urging more assistance from local residents in providing care for foster children. He said there were only four foster homes (as of August) in the county. Those four homes were able to take in a total of 13 foster children, eight below the 21 who were in foster care in the county.\n\nThe struggles of the Madison County Senior Activity and Wellness Center \u2013 which is funded primarily through the Area Aging on Agency (AAA), which has also experienced severe funding cuts over the last several years \u2013 have also been well documented. The AAA, which is funded through DHS, experienced $1 million in cuts in 2014, and the Madison County center faced an additional $17,000 in federal cuts just last year.\n\nRegardless of your feelings on the Affordable Care Act (ACA), it\u2019s here for the foreseeable future. We understand also that the ACA is controversial and certainly not without flaws, and while it\u2019s important to have representation willing to take a stand, that stand shouldn\u2019t come at the cost of the taxpayers \u2013 or the public schools that will be forced to face more budget cuts, or the 266,000 Arkansans who will be left uninsured, or the 255 caseworkers, investigators, supervisors and program assistants with DCFS who are expected to lose their jobs should Arkansas Works fail to receive funding.\n\nSen. King said he would take a stand in helping his district by supporting funding for DHS, but did a 180 when he got to Little Rock under pressure from his fellow senators. We realize there are concerns with the ACA, and agree that those concerns should be addressed, but ask that Sen. King remain true to what he told us weeks ago and vote to put the money where it\u2019s needed most in Arkansas. Furthermore, Rep. Ballinger, if you happen to be reading our editorial, we respectfully ask that you do the same \u2014 represent the county by doing what is best for it and voting to fund Arkansas Works. The county needs it and your constituents do also.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "The Madison County Record", "description": "Arkansas Legislature is scheduled to meet again today to discuss budget options after 10 senators last week prevented a budget proposed by Gov.
