But some of the bizarre comments that came out of Texas Sen. Ted Cruz\u2019s mouth overnight Tuesday were beyond peculiar.\n\nCruz, a Republican senator, said he would speak until he could no longer stand in a Senate filibuster to advocate for the defunding of Obamacare. He began at 2:41 p.m. on Tuesday and continued on into the night, still going as of 5 a.m. Tuesday morning. At 3:33 a.m., Cruz officially broke the record for the longest speech this year, shattering Sen. Rand Paul\u2019s (R-Ky.) record in March during his filibuster for the nomination of John Brennan for CIA director.\n\nCruz said he is fighting against Obamacare to insure \u201cthat the American people have a voice.\u201d He added that his fight is \u201cinsuring that those who are struggling, those who are without a job, those who are afraid about losing their health insurance, that Washington listens to them. That Washington acts on their needs.\u201d\n\nHowever, Cruz\u2019s overnight rant is not technically a filibuster since the voting for Obamacare cannot be halted. While Cruz will be making a statement for his position, he could end up using debate time and leaving the House of Representatives just one day to vote before the Oct. 1 deadline. If a resolution is not reached on this date, the government could shut down.\n\nDespite the vote, Cruz was still standing as of press time, making his case to defund Obamacare \u2026and uttering some bizarre comments ranging from commenting on White Castle to reciting quotes from A&E\u2019s hit show \u201cDuck Dynasty.\u201d He even read Dr. Seuss' \"Green Eggs And Ham\" all the way through for his children at home via C-SPAN.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nBelow is a few of his zingers as well as a live stream video of the \"filibuster.\"\n\nTed Cruz on Green Eggs and Ham, which he insists his father invented:\n\n\u201cI will credit my father, he invented -- this wasn't for the restaurant, but he did it anyway -- green eggs and ham. He did it two ways. The easy way was he would put green food coloring in. \u2018Green eggs and ham\u2019 was my favorite book as a little boy. You can actually do it -- the food coloring is a little bit cheating. But if you take spinach and mix it into the eggs, the eggs turn green.\u201d\n\nTed Cruz on White Castle:\n\n\u201cI like their little burgers. \u2026 I\u2019m a big fan of eating White Castle burgers. Think of all the people that don\u2019t get jobs because there\u2019s no White Castle open, not to mention all of the hungry college kids that at 3:00 in the morning are just craving a White Castle, and they can\u2019t find one.\u201d\n\nTed Cruz on Congress:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit like the World Wrestling Federation. It\u2019s wrestling matches where \u2026 the outcome is pre-rigged, the outcome is predetermined. They know who\u2019s going to win and it\u2019s all for show.\u201d\n\nTed Cruz on the moon:\n\n\u201cThe moon might be as intimidating as Obamacare.\u201d\n\nTed Cruz on political fashion:\n\n\u201cMost Americans could not give a flying flip about a bunch of politicians in Washington. Almost all of us are in cheap suits with bad haircuts. Who cares?\u201d\n\nTed Cruz on parties:\n\n\u201cIt is apparently very, very important to be invited to all the right cocktail parties in town. Now, I\u2019ll confess: I don\u2019t go to a whole lot of cocktail parties in town.\u201d\n\nTed Cruz on \u201cDuck Dynasty:\u201d\n\n\"... Redneck rule number one -- most things can be fixed with duct tape and extension cords \u2026\u201d\n\nTed Cruz on Ashton Kutcher:\n\n\u201cSome time ago I tweeted a speech that Ashton Kutcher gave. It\u2019s a terrific speech. It was a speech at one of these award shows where he talked about the value of hard work. And one of the things I remember he said is he said, you know, in my life, opportunity looks an awful lot like hard work. That was a great message. It was a great message to young people \u2026 I don\u2019t know Mr. Kutcher. I\u2019ve watched his TV shows and his movies. I don\u2019t know him personally. but you know what? he can speak to millions of young people who\u2019ve never listened to you and would never listen to me.\u201d\n\nTed Cruz on Ted Cruz:\n\n\u201cTwenty years from now if there is some obscure trivial pursuits question, I am confident I will be the answer.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nLive streaming video by Ustream", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://s2.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "ted cruz filibuster, ted cruz filibuster speech, ted cruz filibuster live stream, ted cruz filibuster quotes, ted cruz filibuster comments, ted cruz filibuster video, ted cruz live stream, ted cruz live stream video, #makedclisten, #defundobamacare, cruz", "og": {"site_name": "International Business Times", "description": "During his Obamacare critique, Cruz talked about White Castle burgers and insisted his father created the dish green eggs and ham.", "title": "From White Castle To \u2018Duck Dynasty,\u2019 9 Bizarre Ted Cruz Quotes During Senator\u2019s All-Nighter [LIVE STREAM VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.com/white-castle-duck-dynasty-9-bizarre-ted-cruz-quotes-during-senators-all-nighter-live-stream-video", "image": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2013/09/24/ted-cruz-faux-filibuster.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "During his Obamacare critique, Cruz talked about White Castle burgers and insisted his father created the dish green eggs and ham.", "title": "From White Castle To \u2018Duck Dynasty,\u2019 9 Bizarre Ted Cruz Quotes During Senator\u2019s All-Nighter [LIVE STREAM VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.com/white-castle-duck-dynasty-9-bizarre-ted-cruz-quotes-during-senators-all-nighter-live-stream-video", "image": {"src": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2013/09/24/ted-cruz-faux-filibuster.jpg", "identifier": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2013/09/24/ted-cruz-faux-filibuster.jpg"}, "site": "@IBTimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "fb": {"app_id": 263851690471857, "pages": 128026713884051}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/IBTimes", "section": "World", "published_time": "2013-09-25T09:36:02-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-25T12:47:22-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "During his Obamacare critique, Cruz talked about White Castle burgers and insisted his father created the dish green eggs and ham."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcaa2c\"", "article_summary": "Ted Cruz on Green Eggs and Ham, which he insists his father invented:\u201cI will credit my father, he invented -- this wasn't for the restaurant, but he did it anyway -- green eggs and ham.\nBut if you take spinach and mix it into the eggs, the eggs turn green.\u201dTed Cruz on White Castle:\u201cI like their little burgers.\nContinue Reading BelowBelow is a few of his zingers as well as a live stream video of the \"filibuster.\"\n\u2018Green eggs and ham\u2019 was my favorite book as a little boy.\nBut some of the bizarre comments that came out of Texas Sen.
