During one conversation, Felton said he \u201chas a brick in the backyard.\u201d When asked if he sold some of it, Felton replied, \u201cNah, still got two bundles left.\u201d\n\nIn response to the tapes, Felton has said he \u201cnever\n\npossessed any drugs\u201d and was \u201cjust aware of what was around.\u201d\n\nFelton is charged with pointing a loaded handgun at Jersey City Police Sgt. Thomas McVicar, who was in a vehicle on Dwight Street working undercover as part of a multiagency operation.\n\nMcVicar then shot Felton in the face when, authorities say, he heard a live round click into the chamber of the gun. Felton testified that he had no gun.\n\nFelton, who lost sight in both eyes as a result of his injuries, was one of 46 people arrested in Operation Wetlands.\n\nThe jury asked that Velez\u2019s lengthy, seven-hour testimony be played back so they could \u201csort through other evidence\u201d in the trial.\n\nThe deliberations will resume Wednesday with Judge Paul DePascale presiding because Galis-Menendez is on a one-week absence.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "jersey-city", "title": "Jersey City man's jury asks for replay of State Police detective&#8217;s testimony", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Jersey City man\\u0027s jury asks for replay of State Police detective\u2019s testimony\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/jjournal-news/index.ssf/2013/11/jersey_city_mans_jury_asks_for.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/jersey-journal/photo/2013/11/13772662-large.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11605356\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-11-09T08:04:05Z\", \"author\": \"Anthony J.
