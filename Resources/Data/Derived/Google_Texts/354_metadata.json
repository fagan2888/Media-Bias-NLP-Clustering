The death toll reportedly includes Denver-born filmmaker Tom Taplin.\n\nColorado climbers Jim Davidson, Alan Arnette, Charley Mace, Jon Kedrowski, Ryan Waters, Matt Moniz, Kim Hess and Dave Elmore are all safe. Davidson, Arnette and Mace are at camps above the Khumbu Icefall, where the route over the glacier was destroyed.\n\nNBC News reported that Taplin, 61, was making a documentary about the Mount Everest base camp when the avalanche hit. Taplin\u2019s Facebook page lists his home as Evergreen. \u201cThe gods of the mountains have taken him \u2026 our loss forever,\u201d a friend posted.\n\nIn a blog tweeted from the mountain, Kedrowski wrote: \u201cThe lucky ones here that are unharmed and have plenty of supplies it is up to us to stay for awhile and lend a hand.\u201d\n\nKedrowski\u2019s blog depicts a horrific scene as ice and rock tumbled onto the base camp. \u201cRight now 20-plus people are injured and the death toll is 8-20 people, but that may increase. Many of the injuries were similar to ones you might see in the Midwest when a tornado hits, with contusions and lacerations from flying debris. Head Injuries (sic), broken legs, internal injuries, impalements also happened to people,\u201d he wrote.\n\nMoniz, who was also at the base camp, is a 17-year-old junior at Boulder High School and is studying molecular biology at the University of Colorado at Boulder.\n\nMike Moniz said his son has been working with rescue teams and helping to move the injured to a medical tent run by the Himalayan Rescue Association. The former Eagle Scout also has been helping to evacuate the wounded.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado climbers wait on Everest as aftershocks continue", "title": "Colorado climbers wait on Everest as aftershocks continue", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/04/26/colorado-climbers-wait-on-everest-as-aftershocks-continue/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150425__davidson3p1.jpg", "height": 434}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150425__davidson3p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-26T10:14:29+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T19:13:10+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "hiking"}, "article_summary": "NBC News reported that Taplin, 61, was making a documentary about the Mount Everest base camp when the avalanche hit.\nColorado climbers remain on Everest as rescue efforts continue after a massive earthquake killed more than 2,800 people in Nepal and Asia.\nColorado climbers Jim Davidson, Alan Arnette, Charley Mace, Jon Kedrowski, Ryan Waters, Matt Moniz, Kim Hess and Dave Elmore are all safe.\nMoniz, who was also at the base camp, is a 17-year-old junior at Boulder High School and is studying molecular biology at the University of Colorado at Boulder.\nDavidson, Arnette and Mace are at camps above the Khumbu Icefall, where the route over the glacier was destroyed."}
