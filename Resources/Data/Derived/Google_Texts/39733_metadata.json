Another 50,000-plus paid too big a penalty. All told, these overpayments added up to $35 million, the IRS says.\n\nThe second big caveat is the fact that, whatever the administration says about the number of people paying the penalty, the actual money raised by the tax is far lower than had been predicted.\n\nAssuming the IRS pays those 300,000 people back, the tax will have raised just over $1.2 billion this year.\n\nThat\u2019s well below the $2 billion that the Congressional Budget Office had projected just this March \u2014 40% below forecast, as a matter of fact.\n\nThe IRS says the revenue numbers aren\u2019t final and could change. Even so, they\u2019re not likely to reach the CBO\u2019s forecast.\n\nThis shortfall, combined with the fact that other ObamaCare taxes aren\u2019t raising nearly as much as predicted, puts ObamaCare\u2019s finances in even deeper trouble.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This post has been updated. The original version said the CBO had projected in 2010 that the individual mandate would raise $9 billion in 2015. In fact, that number was the combination of revenues from both employer and individual mandate tax.\n\nFollow John Merline on Twitter: @IBD_JMerline.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The IRS reported this week that 6.6 million people paid the ObamaCare mandate penalty for not having insurance last year, which the administration says is 10%", "og": {"site_name": "Investor's Business Daily", "description": "The IRS reported this week that 6.6 million people paid the ObamaCare mandate penalty for not having insurance last year, which the administration says is 10% higher than they\u2019d expected.
