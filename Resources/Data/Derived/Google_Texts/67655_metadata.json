Democrats are scrambling to win back U.S. Rep. Mike Michaud\u2019s seat, which they had for 20 years before Poliquin flipped it earlier this month, winning 48 percent of votes to Cain\u2019s 42 percent.\n\nAdditional Images Emily Cain speaks at the Democratic State Convention in Bangor in this May file photo.

Paul LePage and has been mum on his future plans, but he\u2019s backing away from running for his seat again.\n\nIn a Friday email, Michaud\u2019s chief of staff, Peter Chandler, said \u201cwhile one never says never, it is unlikely that he would seek another term in Congress\u201d and the DCCC has wasted no time pushing Cain to run again.\n\nAfter a Thursday recruiting meeting in Washington first reported by Roll Call, the outgoing DCCC chairman, Rep. Steve Israel of New York, named the 2nd District as a top pick-up opportunity for Democrats in 2016, a presidential election year. The party thinks it can do better nationally than it did this year, when Democrats lost their majority in the U.S. Senate and saw Republicans increase their House majority.\n\nA DCCC aide confirmed that Cain would be one of five candidates nationwide to be asked to enter rematches for their seats, alongside three ousted incumbents in Texas, Nevada and Illinois and another defeated challenger in Colorado.\n\nIn an email, Cain, a 34-year-old state senator from Orono, said she was \u201cflattered to read the news from the DCCC\u201d and is \u201ccontemplating 2016,\u201d but she is focused now on her personal life.\n\nIf she runs, she could have a primary challenger \u2014 Rep. Jeff McCabe, 37, who won a fourth term representing Skowhegan earlier this month. He said Friday that \u201ca lot of people\u201d have approached him since the Nov. 4 election asking him to run in 2016 and that he\u2019s considering it after briefly flirting with a run for the 2nd District earlier this year.\n\nAlso, outgoing state Sen. Troy Jackson of Allagash, a Democrat, has said he\u2019s considering an independent run for the seat in 2016 after establishment Democratic interests lined up against him in his unsuccessful race against Cain in the June primary.\n\nWhen asked if a Cain campaign would dissuade him from running, McCabe said, \u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d saying that he has pursued \u201ca statewide plan for economic growth\u201d in the Legislature. He noted past endorsements from the National Rifle Association, whose backing Poliquin touted as a wedge issue with Cain in this year\u2019s campaign.\n\n\u201cIf you look at my record and who I am, I think I\u2019ve addressed some issues that are important CD2 issues,\u201d McCabe said.\n\nMichael Shepherd \u2014 370-7652\n\n[email protected]\n\nTwitter: @mikeshepherdme", "article_metadata": {"description": "But Emily Cain could face a primary challenge from Skowhegan four-term Rep.
