But that would have been too easy and not nearly as much fun as finding an historic home ready for the wrecking ball.\n\nSo, George Corbett went in search of an old house he and his wife, Nancy, could restore. And in 2006, he found it \u2014 a three-story 1910 Victorian house in Palmetto, sitting on the banks of the Manatee River. It was slated for demolition to make way for condominiums.\n\nAfter much ado and great fanfare, the 220-ton house, featuring a portico, turret and a wraparound porch, along with its cottage, were floated 25 miles north on barges up Tampa Bay, under the Sunshine Skyway Bridge and around a bend to the property in Ruskin.\n\nSeven years later, Lamb Manor \u2014 named for Asa Lamb, the son of Palmetto founder Samuel Lamb \u2014 is fully restored and up for sale. The buyer can move in to this elegantly furnished, custom home for $4.9 million.\n\nIt is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\n\u201cYou just can\u2019t build a place like this,\u201d George Corbett said. \u201cYou can collect parts from all over the country and in this case, the world, but you can\u2019t do that with a new house.\u201d\n\nThe couple added a bottom floor with a theater room, an elevator from the old Woolworth mansion on Palm Beach, bronze door handles and sconces from around the country and adorned it with custom drapery, antique cabinets from Savannah, chandeliers they purchased in Massachusetts and stained glass windows they found scattered throughout the Northeast.\n\nThey added antique crown molding and tin ceiling tiles, had custom woodwork made for the walls and dressed it in fine French furnishings.\n\nAnd all the while, they had a ball doing it, Nancy Corbett said.\n\n\u201cYou can spend $10 million on a house in Tampa and you\u2019re looking across the canal at other $10 million houses with TV antennas and satellite dishes,\u201d George Corbett said. On their Ruskin property, the couple kept the scrub oak forest filled with ferns and added some tropical plants, like palm trees and birds of paradise. Their efforts are visible from the wrap-around veranda that overlooks the river, where manatees and bottlenose dolphins swim past roseate spoonbills and the occasional fisherman.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like old Florida,\u201d the Miami native said.\n\nStill, he said, he and Nancy don\u2019t get too attached to things like houses. \u201cWe\u2019re attached to each other.\u201d They plan to move to Plant City to be closer to their grandchildren and are open to the possibility of finding and restoring yet another historic home.\n\nThis is the eighth house they have refurbished and some of the others have been historic, too.\n\nThe couple still owns a Christian camp in North Carolina, the former hunting lodge of Thomas Edison, Henry Ford and Harvey Firestone. They restored the 1903 lodge and its 20 nearby cabins on 100 acres to use as a retreat for ministers. They also purchased and restored the former Winter Haven home of 1960s and \u201870s country stars Bobbie Gentry, \u201cOde to Billie Jo\u201d from 1967, and Jim Stafford, \u201cSpiders and Snakes\u201d and \u201cWildwood Weed\u201d from the 1970s.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve restored houses all our married lives. This one was not in terrible shape,\u201d but it had its challenges, Nancy Corbett said. Just finding all that bronze was one of them. \u201cWe bought three times more than we actually used, because you didn\u2019t know which pieces would work where\u201d George Corbett said.\n\nLoving to antique together, the couple scoured salvage yards, hit antique shops, and supply houses, worked with online dealers and even got a few things, like the wooden front door, on eBay. More than once, Nancy Corbett said, their motor home was filled to the ceiling as they trooped up north and back again.\n\n\u201cWe had some amazing craftsmen work for us, too,\u201d Nancy Corbett said. \u201cI can\u2019t say enough about their talent.\u201d They installed the mantels, the crown molding, the brick in the kitchen and all those windows collected from a half-dozen states.\n\nAdmittedly, she says, the couple took a plain house and made it fancy. But they also made room for family fun. The fourth floor is their jungle room, decorated to look like a thatched-roof African hut, with sprawling couches and tucked-away tables for game nights with the grandchildren.\n\nThe addition of more windows throughout the house gives it a lighter look than it previously had, especially near the several dining areas scattered throughout the 25 rooms.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the beauty of a Victorian,\u201d Nancy Corbett said. \u201cYou can put in it what you like. We like French, so we put in a lot of French furnishings. Still, it\u2019s not a hodgepodge. It works.\u201d\n\nIt was a lot of work to find old pieces that matched pieces they planned to save in the house, George Corbett said. In the sitting area of the master suite, for example, they needed to find stained glass to match a window with green and yellow glass.\n\n\u201cThat stained glass, one piece was from Pittsburgh and one from an antique dealer and the other from another part of the country. That\u2019s how good Nancy is at this. It was really interesting. It really was fun. We really enjoy being together and we enjoy the beauty of the old world things.\u201d\n\nyhammett@tampatrib.com\n\n(813) 259-7127", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sun, 16 Mar 2014 14:51:04 -0400", "Description": "RUSKIN \u2014 They could have built a new house on their five oak-covered acres skirting the edge of the Little Manatee River.
