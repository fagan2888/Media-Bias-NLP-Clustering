(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)\n\nSenate leaders have no plans to move their own debt ceiling bill this week and will instead wait for House Republicans to act and prove they have the votes to increase the government\u2019s borrowing limit amid the continuing uncertainty over who will replace Speaker John Boehner in the coming weeks.\n\nOn Tuesday, Senate Republicans made clear they are prepared to handle a debt limit increase but are wary of holding any politically uncomfortable votes until it\u2019s clear a bill can get through Congress.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s kind of why\u2026 we want to see them take the lead on this,\u201d Republican Conference Committee Chairman John Thune (R-S.D.) said of House Republicans. \u201cThey have to figure out how to assemble the necessary 218 votes to move it and whatever they send over we\u2019ll act on.\u201d\n\nHouse Republicans have been distracted by the breakdown in the race to succeed Boehner (R-Ohio), who plans to step down at the end of the month, and have no clear plan for increasing the debt limit despite the looming Nov. 3 deadline. The same bloc of conservatives that forced Boehner\u2019s ouster have repeatedly threatened to block the must-pass legislation if debt limit increases are not paired with deep spending cuts.\n\nDemocrats and the White House have said repeatedly that President Obama will accept only a clean increase of the borrowing limit.\n\n\u201cIt is nonnegotiable,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) said Tuesday. \u201cIt is a straight up or down vote on extending the debt of this country.\u201d\n\nReid and the White House said they are willing to continue spending discussions related to a broader budget deal, but those talks must be separate from a debt limit bill.\n\n\u201cProgress has been made in other talks, staff-level, with the budgeting,\u201d Reid said. \u201cBut until we get the debt ceiling done, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s going to be anything done of a serious nature.\u201d\n\nIn recent days, some Senate Republicans have reluctantly signaled that they are willing to consider a clean bill in order to avoid a default but they are not willing to force a series of difficult votes if the House cannot pass an increase in the government\u2019s borrowing limit.\n\n\u201cIt would be better to know ahead of time what they can do,\u201d said Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn. \u201cIf we start something over here and then pass it and they can\u2019t pass it it\u2019s going to be an exercise in futility.\u201d\n\nA vote on a clean bill would require at least a dozen Senate Republicans to abandon their call for spending cuts to offset a debt limit increase and join Democrats in voting to raise the debt ceiling.\n\nIt also takes time.\n\nThune told reporters after a weekly closed-door party luncheon that it could take as long as week to move a debt limit increase in the Senate. The process would include several procedural votes, each requiring at least 60 votes, and several days of debate.\n\nThe only way to speed up the process would be for all 100 Senators to agree to bypass some procedural votes. Unanimous agreement is unlikely because several conservatives, including presidential candidates Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Ted Cruz (R-Texas), are expected to oppose the bill.\n\nThat leaves the Senate waiting for the House to figure out a path forward.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to wait and see how the House deals with that issue and we\u2019ll respond accordingly,\u201d McConnell said Tuesday.\n\nThe issue could come up Tuesday night when House Republicans meet to discuss the agenda for the next two weeks, but the majority of the meeting is expected to center on whether House Ways and Means Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wisc.) will run to replace Boehner as speaker. Several aides said they expect the debt limit could be added to the schedule later in the week after the Ryan question has been settled.\n\nFor now, the House is scheduled to vote Wednesday on a bill that would require the government to \u201cprioritize\u201d payments if the debt ceiling is not raised by using tax revenue coming in to first pay interest on government debt and Social Security benefits.\n\nSupporters of the contingency plan argue the bill would partially avoid default. Critics, including Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew, argue it is impossible to pay some debts and not others and the Senate is not expected to take up the legislation.\n\nLew met Tuesday with members of the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee to discuss plans for the debt limit but no decisions were reached.\n\nThe House will also vote later this week on a budget reconciliation bill that has become a priority for conservatives. Reconciliation bills are considered under special rules that require only a simple majority in both the House and the Senate to pass. Some Republicans want to attach language to defund both the Affordable Care Act and Planned Parenthood and take advantage of the special rules to force Obama to veto the package.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Senate wants the House to prove it can pass a bill before it holds its own roll call.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/kelsey.snell.3", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The Senate wants the House to prove it can pass a bill before it holds its own roll call.", "title": "Senate to House on debt limit vote: You first", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/10/20/senate-to-house-on-debt-limit-vote-you-first/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/05/20/Production/Daily/A-Section/Images/473993012.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@kelsey_snell"}, "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "debt limit, Ryan, Boehner, McConnell", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/kelsey.snell.3"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "debt limit, Ryan, Boehner, McConnell"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca7a7\"", "article_summary": "Lew met Tuesday with members of the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee to discuss plans for the debt limit but no decisions were reached.\nHouse Republican leader John Boehner of Ohio, right, and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Ky., have yet to agree on a strategy for increasing the debt limit .\nThune told reporters after a weekly closed-door party luncheon that it could take as long as week to move a debt limit increase in the Senate.\nThe same bloc of conservatives that forced Boehner\u2019s ouster have repeatedly threatened to block the must-pass legislation if debt limit increases are not paired with deep spending cuts.\nOn Tuesday, Senate Republicans made clear they are prepared to handle a debt limit increase but are wary of holding any politically uncomfortable votes until it\u2019s clear a bill can get through Congress."}
