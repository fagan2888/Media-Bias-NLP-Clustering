(Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nASBURY PARK, N.J. \u2014 The cost to treat breast cancer is anyone\u2019s guess, but patients who are covered by insurance have lower bills than those who aren\u2019t, researchers found.\n\nUninsured cancer patients pay up to twice as much for doctors\u2019 visits and 43 times as much for chemotherapy drugs compared with what Medicare and private insurance pays, a study from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill showed.\n\n\u201cThis is unreasonable,\u201d said Stacie Dusetzina, an assistant professor in the Eshelman School of Pharmacy and the Gillings School of Global Public Health. \u201cThere needs to be more transparency and less variability in health care pricing.\u201d\n\nOctober is Breast Cancer Awareness month, raising money for a disease that affects about one in 12 women. And researchers have made progress; the five-year survival rate has climbed from 75% in 1975 to close to 90%, government data shows.\n\nBut how much does it cost to treat breast cancer? No one seems to know.\n\nThe uncertainty is getting more attention since the Affordable Care Act, also called \u201cObamacare,\u201d was passed in 2010. It ensured that mammograms would be covered by health insurance plans for free. But it also has led to insurance policies that have higher out-of-pocket costs \u2014 co-payments and deductibles \u2014 for consumers.\n\nHow do you know what treatment costs?\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t,\u201d said Jessica Morton, director of mission for Susan G. Komen Central and South Jersey, an advocacy group. \u201cWe try to pin down numbers like average cost, but it\u2019s super hard.\u201d\n\nKimberly Callis, 42, of Lacey was diagnosed with breast cancer in January 2013. She has an insurance policy through Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield that has picked up most of the bill for her treatment.\n\nBut each time she walks into her oncologist\u2019s office, she has a $50 co-payment. After a few office visits a month, it adds up.\n\nThe financial strain is more acute. She and her husband own Stage Drop, which provides portable stages for events. But she hasn\u2019t been able to work as much since her diagnosis.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of co-pays,\u201d Callis said. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely had a financial impact.\u201d\n\nPinning down the cost is a difficult endeavor. The average cost of care for breast cancer in women age 65 and older is $23,078 for initial treatment and $2,207 for continuing treatment, making it one of the less-expensive cancers to treat, according to data from the National Cancer Institute.\n\nBreast cancer is diagnosed with many cell types and stages, said Dr. Denise Johnson Miller, medical director of the Breast Surgery program at Meridian Health, a New Jersey-based company that operates six hospitals in Monmouth and Ocean counties. There are women diagnosed with early stage disease and some who are diagnosed late. Most women respond well to treatment, but there are still women who don\u2019t.\n\n\u201cCost of treatment varies,\u201d Miller said. \u201cYou may have breast-conserving surgery, six, seven weeks of radiation and hormonal therapy. However, if you have a complete mastectomy, breast reconstruction, chemotherapy, a year-plus of (cancer drug) Herceptin (combined with) Perjeta, the treatment costs will be greater. All women definitely need insurance.\u201d\n\nThe Affordable Care Act requires virtually all Americans to have health insurance or pay a penalty. Even so, 10.9% of New Jerseyans under age 65 weren\u2019t covered in 2014, according to U.S. Census data.\n\nWithout the negotiating power that private insurance or Medicare has, they face much higher costs if they are diagnosed with cancer, North Carolina researchers found.\n\nFor example, they paid $6,711 for an infusion of the colorectal cancer drug oxaliplatin. Medicare paid $3,090 and private health plans paid $3,616 for the same drug, according to the study.\n\nDoctor visits also were more expensive \u2014 $129 to $391 for uninsured patients compared with $65 to $246 for insured patients, the study said.\n\n\u201cUninsured patients don\u2019t have the bargaining power, or they may not try to negotiate for a better price,\u201d Dusetzina said.\n\n-----\n\nTips to lower medicine costs\n\n\u2022 Ask your doctor about generic medicines.\n\n\u2022 Ask your doctor for samples of medicines you\u2019re prescribed.\n\n\u2022 Ask for medications in the form of pills, which tend to cost less.\n\n\u2022 Shop around to pharmacies. Larger stores may have lower prices.\n\n\u2022 Don\u2019t order medicine from online pharmacies. Prices may be lower, but the pharmacies may not be licensed.\n\n\u2022 Call drugmakers to see if you qualify for financial assistance programs.\n\nSource: Breastcancer.org\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1LasHCK", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "How much does it cost to treat breast cancer?
