She and Michelle Thrush walked the red carpet at the Cannes Film Festival\u2014the first Native actresses to do so\u2014for Jimmy P. Her work in the August: Osage County ensemble has been recognized by the Screen Actors Guild, the Hollywood Film Festival and several critics\u2019 societies.\n\nBut Upham has been just as busy off the screen with professional and personal activities. She recently spoke with ICTMN about what she\u2019s doing when she\u2019s not making movies.\n\nYou\u2019re already winning plaudits for your work in August: Osage County. Tell us about that.\n\nIt was expected, but sort of strange to have awards when the film wasn\u2019t really out yet. I remember with all of my other films we had to work for up to a year just to get recognized. Star power.\n\nWhat was it like seeing your fellow cast members again at SAG Awards?\n\nIt was great seeing them. I never realized how busy everybody is including myself. I will never doubt or scoff at a headline that says someone was hospitalized for \u201cexhaustion\u201d because I\u2019ve been hospitalized twice in the last six months. They really are the hardest workers. If people think getting to that level is tough, try maintaining it.\n\nYou\u2019ve started your own acting troupe called Indigo Children. What\u2019s the idea there? How does it differ from other acting troupes?\n\nI am teaching my actors the technique I was taught, which is all about energy. You don\u2019t have to say a word or make an expression. You project energy and that\u2019s what touches people across the world who are watching it in a theater.\n\n[The actors] will also be trained in every form. From singing to dance to business. I\u2019m preparing the Navy SEALs of Hollywood.\n\nWe also have plans to give back to the Native community. Acting saved my life. I recognize that.\n\nWhat are your plans for Indigo Children?\n\nTo not only become a troupe in the true definition of what a troupe originally was (a family), but to recruit only the best of the best. I have very strict rules. We started out with almost 30 members, but I had to let a lot of people go and some chose to quit. It ranged from flakiness, intimidation, lack of commitment, fear and drama. I\u2019m teaching them the business and how to navigate the pitfalls. Nobody did that for me. I had to learn on my own.\n\nYou\u2019re also active in charitable work. Tell us about the causes you support.\n\nI am involved with Caring Across Generations (caringacross.org) which aims to educate the world about our elderly and incapacitated members of society. Many older people are dumped off in nursing homes and just left to die. They are very lonely and broken. This goes for young and ill people as well. Natives have always kept the generations connected. That\u2019s why they chose me.\n\nI am also an ambassador for domestic workers rights. I was a house-cleaner for many years and suffered great abuse and was treated less than human at times. I also had many wonderful bosses who were great. We just want to make it legal for fair wages, sick days, maternity leave, overtime pay, bio-hazard protection and in general a sense of respect.\n\nAn organization called Fuel - We Power Change helped connect you with these causes. How does that work?\n\nFuel - We Power Change has a headquarter in Los Angeles. Ai-Jen Poo, one of Time magazine\u2019s most influential people of the world, contacted me to be an ambassador after hearing my story and struggle. Glad to help and educate people on these two great causes.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Actress Misty Upham of 'August: Osage County' discusses acting, activism, and her acting troupe Indigo Children.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "jrobertson", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/02/04/august-osage-county-actress-misty-upham-acting-saved-my-life-153402", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/misty-upham-juliette-lewis-august-osage-county.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "'August: Osage County' Actress Misty Upham: 'Acting Saved my Life'"}, "abstract": "Actress Misty Upham of 'August: Osage County' discusses acting, activism, and her acting troupe Indigo Children.", "dc": {"title": "'August: Osage County' Actress Misty Upham: 'Acting Saved my Life'"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/02/04/august-osage-county-actress-misty-upham-acting-saved-my-life-153402", "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Misty Upham, August: Osage County, Indigo Children, Native American Actresses, American Indian Actresses", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.date": "2014-02-04T12:30-05:00", "dcterms.title": "'August: Osage County' Actress Misty Upham: 'Acting Saved my Life'"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc8ed\"", "article_summary": "Blackfeet actress Misty Upham had a big year in 2013 with important roles in two major movies: Jimmy P. and August: Osage County.\nYou\u2019re already winning plaudits for your work in August: Osage County.\nGlad to help and educate people on these two great causes.\nI remember with all of my other films we had to work for up to a year just to get recognized.\nIt was expected, but sort of strange to have awards when the film wasn\u2019t really out yet."}
