Peeling back the tarp over the doorway, the skinny girl reaches out into the dirt alleyway to hug the church volunteer arriving to take her to dance class.\n\nGrowing up amid drug dealers and addicts, Gabriela has yet to learn how to read. Yet she and other girls from a rough neighborhood known as a \u201ccracolandia,\u201d or crackland, are learning the graceful art courtesy of a local church group that also offers them food, counseling and Bible studies. The class is among several groups where young dancers hope to catch the eye of a respected Brazilian ballerina who recruits dozens of disadvantaged girls for an annual workshop.\n\nTwice a week, more than 20 girls, ages 5 through 12, board a Volkswagen van for a 10-minute ride to class, where they put on pink or black tights and ballet shoes donated by a dancewear store.\n\nOn a recent day, instructor Joana Machado played a jaunty tune of flutes and piano. Sitting on the floor, the girls formed a circle with their legs out in front of them and knees straight. They flexed their feet and then stretched their toes down toward the floor, over and over again while Machado corrected the younger ones\u2019 form.\n\nThe time spent focused on grace and control is far removed from the girls\u2019 daily lives. Many are being raised by parents who are recovering from or are addicted to drugs. Some girls live with relatives who are dealers, or they have been abandoned and taken in by neighbors. Some have experienced violence.\n\nGirls growing up in favelas are more likely to become pregnant as teens, and the last 2010 census found the rate of illiteracy was twice as high in the slums than in other areas of Brazil.\n\n\u201cWe see all kinds of stories here. From girls who haven\u2019t showered in days, who don\u2019t know how to brush their teeth, who are locked inside their homes all day,\u201d said Machado, instructor and head of the project. \u201cI feel always responsible for their lives, always worried about what may happen.\u201d\n\nMachado just opened the studio named \u201cHouse of Dreams\u201d in the neighborhood, relocating the class from a more commercial area of Sao Paulo. Machado herself was raised by a drug addict, who later recovered, in the northeastern state of Bahia.\n\nBallet dancer Priscilla Yokoi, whose performances have taken her to 15 countries including the United States, recently visited and chose five of the girls for the annual workshop. It allows 150 disadvantaged children to take four days of classes with foreign ballerinas and perform a show in October. The school Gabriela attends doesn\u2019t accept boys, but some of the other groups that Yokoi visits do.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Girls from Brazil\u2019s favelas find escape in ballet", "author": "Adriana Gomez Licon", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Girls from Brazil\u2019s favelas find escape in ballet", "title": "Girls from Brazil\u2019s favelas find escape in ballet", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/08/25/girls_from_brazils_favelas_find_escape_in_ballet/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/brazil-favela-ballet.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Girls from Brazil\u2019s favelas find escape in ballet", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/brazil-favela-ballet.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "title": "Girls from Brazil\u2019s favelas find escape in ballet", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Girls from Brazil\u2019s favelas find escape in ballet", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdde9\"", "article_summary": "Ballet dancer Priscilla Yokoi, whose performances have taken her to 15 countries including the United States, recently visited and chose five of the girls for the annual workshop.\nSitting on the floor, the girls formed a circle with their legs out in front of them and knees straight.\nSome girls live with relatives who are dealers, or they have been abandoned and taken in by neighbors.\nThe time spent focused on grace and control is far removed from the girls\u2019 daily lives.\nIt allows 150 disadvantaged children to take four days of classes with foreign ballerinas and perform a show in October."}
