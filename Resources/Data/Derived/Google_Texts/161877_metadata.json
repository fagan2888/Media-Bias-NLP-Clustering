(WDRB) \u2013 Whether on taxes, education or casino gambling, there was little daylight between likely Republican rivals for governor, Hal Heiner and James Comer, at the Kentucky Chamber of Commerce\u2019s annual meeting on Tuesday.Speaking on a panel that also included state Auditor Adam Edelen, Heiner and Comer each said they\u2019re against Kentucky's adoption of Common Core education standards; that they want to significantly cut or eliminate Kentucky\u2019s income tax; that Kentucky needs a \u201cright to work\u201d law prohibiting closed-union workplaces and that they would not \u201cstand in the way\u201d of a constitutional amendment to allow expanded gambling.\n\nHeiner, a former Louisville Metro Council member, has announced his candidacy for the Republican nomination for governor in 2015. Comer, the Kentucky Agriculture Commissioner, is expected to enter the race.\n\nHeiner and Comer each said they wouldn\u2019t dismantle Kynect, Kentucky\u2019s health insurance exchange, though they criticized the Affordable Care Act and Gov. Steve Beshear\u2019s decision to expand eligibility for Medicaid as part of the health reform law. And they both said they do not favor a statewide smoking ban.\n\nIn one small disagreement, Comer said gay marriage will be an important issue in the race, while Heiner said the issue will likely be hashed out at the federal level by the Supreme Court.\n\nComer took the opportunity to criticize Attorney General Jack Conway, a contender for the Democratic nomination for governor, over his decision earlier this year not to defend Kentucky\u2019s gay marriage ban in court.\n\n\u201cHis job is to uphold the (Kentucky) constitution\u2026 Whether you agree with gay marriage or disagree with gay marriage, the constitution is clear,\u201d Comer said.\n\nOn the Common Core, Heiner and Comer each said Kentucky\u2019s participation in a group of states agreeing on minimum education standards smacks of a nationwide mandate from the federal government as to what schools should teach.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we should sign up for something that ultimately -- down the road -- could be a federalization of education,\u201d Heiner said.\n\nConway canceled his appearance at the event Tuesday at the downtown Marriott hotel in Louisville. Edelen, a Democrat who passed on the governor\u2019s race, acknowledged the awkwardness of being the \u201codd man out\u201d on the panel.\n\nWhile praising both men, Edelen said an economic development strategy focused on making it harder to unionize workplaces and cutting the state income tax is outdated and \u201creflects Mississippi.\u201d\n\nKentucky\u2019s next governor, Edelen said, \u201cwill have to have the courage to look the Tea Party in the eye and say, 'Sorry, Common Core is where we need to go.'\u201d\n\nCopyright 2014 WDRB News.
