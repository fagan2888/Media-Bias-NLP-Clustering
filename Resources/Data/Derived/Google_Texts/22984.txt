SINGAPORE (AP) — Singaporeans are lining a 15 kilometer (9 mile) route through the city-state to witness an elaborate funeral procession for longtime leader Lee Kuan Yew.

During a week of national mourning that began Monday after Lee’s death at age 91, some 450,000 people queued for hours for a glimpse of Lee’s coffin at Parliament House. A million people visited tribute sites at community centers across the island.

People began arriving along the cortege route not long after dawn for the procession which begins early Sunday afternoon.

Leaders and dignitaries from more than two dozen countries are attending the state funeral.

Lee was Singapore’s prime minister for more than three decades, ruling with an iron grip until 1990 and is regarded by Singaporeans as the architect of their island’s prosperity.
