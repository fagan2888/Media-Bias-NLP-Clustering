Kiz: Peyton Manning and Patrick Roy both began the second act of a legendary sports career in Denver. As goalie for the Avalanche, Roy finished with 551 NHL victories. With the Broncos, Manning recently threw his 503rd NFL touchdown pass. Which feat in our city’s unique, elite 500 club is more impressive?

Hooch: Manning will become the all-time TD leader soon with 509— Roy isn’t even the all-time wins leader ( second to Martin Brodeur). And what complements Manning’s touchdown greatness is his lack of interceptions. Brett Favre had 508 TDs and 336 INTs, while Manning has thrown 222 picks, with 28 coming in his rookie season. Advantage, Peyton.

Kiz: No disrespect to the incredible Mr. Manning, but I can’t hear you, Ben. The Stanley Cup rings of Roy are plugging my ears. You play to win the game. So when you compare 551 victories versus 503 TDs? It’s no contest. Advantage, Roy.

Hooch: Oh, by the way, Peyton also missed an entire season! He had thrown 33 TDs in each of the two seasons before his injury, so let’s say he would’ve tossed 33 in 2011. The math says that by the middle of next season, he’d be the only member of the 600-TD club!

Kiz: I respect and admire Manning’s work for the Broncos. But I absolutely love what Roy did for the Avs. The championship history of the Avalanche can’t be written without Roy. But here’s the truth: When I look at Manning, I still see him as an Indianapolis Colt dressed in Broncos clothing.

Hooch: Not only is Roy an icon in Denver, he’s part of the coolest thing in Denver sports history — the split Avs and Rockies No. 33 jersey that says ROYKER. Saint Patrick is on our city’s sports Mount Rushmore (along with John Elway, Todd Helton and Danny Schayes). But when it comes to the battle of the 500 fellows, I’ll take the Colt in orange.
