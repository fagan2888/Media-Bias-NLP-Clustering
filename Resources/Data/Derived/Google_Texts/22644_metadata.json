We felt the ice, we heard the roaring crowd,\" Ilinykh, 19, told reporters.\n\n\"It just so happens that no-one has used this music yet in ice dancing. It is an amazing piece by a Russian composer.\"\n\nThe explosive team's acrobatic lifts not only had the crowd gasping but they were also rewarded by the technical judges.\n\nThey were outclassed, however, by U.S. rivals Meryl Davis and Charlie White and Canada's Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir, who took first and second place in the short dance.\n\nRussian ice dancers traditionally ruled the discipline, with skaters from the former Soviet Union winning seven out of 10 medals in the event at the Olympics. But with Russian coach Marina Zoueva training the top two teams, power has shifted.\n\nThe Russian couple, who grew up skating together as children but teamed up later in their careers, only finished ninth at last year's world championships.\n\nBut with the home crowd cheering them on in Sochi and one medal under their belts already, the first time Olympians will have their sights on another in Monday's free skate.\n\n\"Skating in a Winter Olympics at home is pure joy for us. It is a holiday,\" said Katsalapov, 22.\n\nIlinykh will take center stage again in a plunging neckline and black tutu that is as much Bolshoi ballet as Hollywood blockbuster - echoing Natalie Portman's tortured incarnation of the sorceress who impersonates Odile to steal away her prince.\n\n\"We decided right away that the Black Swan matched my inner character better,\" said Ilinykh, bejeweled in glittering Swarovski crystals after Sunday's breakthrough performance.\n\nHard on their heels are veteran French ice dancers Nathalie Pechalat and Fabian Bourzat, who were third at last year's world championships.\n\n\"The fact that we are fourth is good for us. We like that. It means we will have to attack more tomorrow,\" Pechalat said.\n\n(Editing by Rex Gowar)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Alissa de Carbonnel", "Author": "Alissa de Carbonnel", "DCSext.PageNumber": 1, "twitter": {"description": "At the first few notes of Tchaikovsky's \"Swan Lake\", they had the audience in their pocket.", "title": "Russian Odile set to sizzle in Swan Lake skate off", "image": "http://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20140216&t=2&i=840463983&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=CBREA1F1Q5K00", "creator": "@Reuters", "site": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "DCSext.rChannel": "Finance", "sailthru.tags": "US, OLYMPICS, FIGURESKATING, RUSSIANS", "sailthru.title": "Russian Odile set to sizzle in Swan Lake skate off", "keywords": "US,OLYMPICS,FIGURESKATING,RUSSIANS,Euro Zone,United States,CIS Countries,Society / Social Issues,East European Countries,Europe,Olympics,Canada,Asia / Pacific,Emerging Market Countries,Living / Lifestyle,Figure Skating,France,Russia,General News,Western Europe,Sport,Americas,Central / Eastern Europe", "DCSext.ContentType": "Article", "news_keywords": "US;OLYMPICS;FIGURESKATING;RUSSIANS;Euro Zone;United States;CIS Countries;Society / Social Issues;East European Countries;Europe;Olympics;Canada;Asia / Pacific;Emerging Market Countries;Living / Lifestyle;Figure Skating;France;Russia;General News;Western Europe;Sport;Americas;Central / Eastern Europe", "WT.cg_n": "Finance - Industries", "sailthru.description": "At the first few notes of Tchaikovsky's \"Swan Lake\", they had the audience in their pocket.", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "Daimler", "sailthru.date": "2014-02-16T22:22:31+0000", "DCSext.ChannelList": "SochiOlympics2014;Travel;ford;Daimler;SafetyandInnovation;Inspiration;ToyotaPrius;everything;treasuryMarkets;Continental;forexNewsCopy;Shell;Amtrak;Amtrak2;yahoo3;echoActivityStream;AllianzInvestments;FedExSMB;Goldman;everythingButHugin;OutloudFeed;Allianz;JPMorgan;sapawareness;CFA;jpGambaroPeople;trending-hp;sprintxpert2;statestreetetf;samsung;marine;cfaglobal;merrilledge;nonegative;citianniversary;dassaultuk;greenpeace;MLGZero;PorscheCayenne;MBenz;ubs;BNY;citgroup;Bosneg;Intel", "DCSext.ContentHeadline": "Russian+Odile+set+to+sizzle+in+Swan+Lake+skate+off", "DCSext.ContentID": "USBREA1F0V520140216", "WT.cg_s": "Daimler", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20140216&t=2&i=840463983&w=&fh=50&fw=50&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=CBREA1F1Q5K00", "description": "At the first few notes of Tchaikovsky's \"Swan Lake\", they had the audience in their pocket.", "sailthru.contenttype": "Article", "DCSext.ContentID_Daimler": "USBREA1F0V520140216", "robots": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "WT.z_inlinetype": "false", "DCSext.rAuthor": "Alissa de Carbonnel", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "DCSext.rCountry": "BETAUS", "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/bizfinance/industries/article", "viewport": "width=1100", "DCSext.PageTotal": 1, "WT.z_navid": "nav-Text-Daimler", "site edition": "Reuters", "og": {"site_name": "Reuters", "description": "At the first few notes of Tchaikovsky's \"Swan Lake\", they had the audience in their pocket.", "title": "Russian Odile set to sizzle in Swan Lake skate off", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20140216&t=2&i=840463983&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=CBREA1F1Q5K00", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-olympics-figureskating-russians-idUSBREA1F0V520140216", "article": {"section": "Finance - Industries", "tag": "US,OLYMPICS,FIGURESKATING,RUSSIANS,Euro Zone,United States,CIS Countries,Society / Social Issues,East European Countries,Europe,Olympics,Canada,Asia / Pacific,Emerging Market Countries,Living / Lifestyle,Figure Skating,France,Russia,General News,Western Europe,Sport,Americas,Central / Eastern Europe", "published_time": "2014-02-16T22:22:31+0000", "modified_time": "2014-02-16T22:22:31+0000", "author": "Alissa de Carbonnel"}, "type": "article"}, "REVISION_DATE": "Sun Feb 16 22:22:31 UTC 2014", "DCSext.contentversion": "original", "sailthru.image.full": "http://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20140216&t=2&i=840463983&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=CBREA1F1Q5K00"}, "article_summary": "Russia's Elena Ilinykh and Nikita Katsalapov compete during the Figure Skating Ice Dance Short Dance Program at the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics, February 16 2014.\nSOCHI, Russia At the first few notes of Tchaikovsky's \"Swan Lake\", they had the audience in their pocket.\nRussian ice dancers traditionally ruled the discipline, with skaters from the former Soviet Union winning seven out of 10 medals in the event at the Olympics.\nWe felt the ice, we heard the roaring crowd,\" Ilinykh, 19, told reporters.\nSeizing third place with a lively quickstep in the short dance on Sunday, the twice European silver medalists will look to repeat the magic - this time for their own Olympic podium moment."}
