The former first lady also discussed how being a grandmother will \"make her a better president.\"\n\nStops at online communities such as Quora are becoming increasingly valuable to candidates as social media plays a bigger role in how Americans consume political news and information. A survey conducted by the Pew Research Center before the 2014 mid-term elections found that 16 percent of registered voters followed candidates or other political figures on social media, a sharp rise from 6 percent during the 2010 midterm elections.\n\nQuora, which was founded in 2009 by former Facebook engineers, aims to \"democratize access to knowledge of all kinds.\" Its pitch to consumers is that the quality of content is best on Quora because it encourages identity, meaning people often submit and respond to questions using their real names.\n\nThe Mountain View, California-based company hopes its verified discussions will stand out from the other platforms such as Reddit or Twitter by housing detailed, long-form content. The site has already become a favorite for Silicon Valley bigwigs to answer questions about the industry, or for employees to tell all about what it's like to work for a certain company.\n\nThe forum has more than 500,000 topics, more than $150 million in venture capital, and an unknown number of users but so far no revenue. However, Marc Bodnick, Quora's head of business and community, told Bloomberg in January that the company planned to begin carrying advertising by mid-2016.\n\nQuora representatives declined to discuss the number of users it has or the state of its revenue plans.\n\nWhile Clinton is the first presidential candidate to make a campaign stop at Quora, she isn't the first politician to answer questions at the online forum. In 2014, President Barack Obama paid a visit to Quora as part of a media tour to encourage more people to sign up for health coverage through the Affordable Care Act before an impending deadline.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Democratic candidate for president visits the popular online forum to discuss health care, Planned Parenthood and being a grandmother.", "google-site-verification": "wNWLoFvk5wsdZQ-u75uCNiaHNa7FLFmNtH2t7dZbXmQ", "og": {"site_name": "CNET", "description": "Democratic candidate for president visits the popular online forum to discuss health care, Planned Parenthood and being a grandmother.", "title": "Hillary Clinton makes campaign stop on Quora", "url": "http://www.cnet.com/news/hillary-clinton-makes-campaign-stop-on-quora/", "image": "https://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/12/02/75119947-8449-4fb9-b926-bef4ac21c4f5/thumbnail/670x503/78e56ffb9f907d22b99ee57660070a17/42-79635668-hillary-clinton-corbis.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Democratic candidate for president visits the popular online forum to discuss health care, Planned Parenthood and being a grandmother.", "title": "Hillary Clinton makes campaign stop on Quora", "url": "http://www.cnet.com/news/hillary-clinton-makes-campaign-stop-on-quora/", "image": {"width": 670, "identifier": "https://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/12/02/75119947-8449-4fb9-b926-bef4ac21c4f5/thumbnail/670x503/78e56ffb9f907d22b99ee57660070a17/42-79635668-hillary-clinton-corbis.jpg", "height": 503}, "creator": "@stevenmusil", "site": "@CNET", "card": "summary", "account_id": 30261067}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "http://www.cnet.com/news/hillary-clinton-makes-campaign-stop-on-quora/?search=toapp", "app_name": "CNET", "app_store_id": 383989837}}, "tp": {"baseUrl": "https://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/fly/bundles/cnetmpxpdk/pdk"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Product reviews and prices, software downloads, and tech news - CNET", "p": {"domain_verify": "47524839a64b83c951afca9ef6c838e0"}, "fb": {"admins": 100001036810388, "app_id": 16995676698}, "msapplication-window": "width=1024;height=768", "viewport": "width=device-width", "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.cnet.com/", "fragment": "!", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnet"}, "msapplication-navbutton-color": "#424244", "msapplication-task": "name=Forums; action-uri=http://forums.cnet.com/; icon-uri=http://www.cnet.com/favicon.ico"}, "article_summary": "While Clinton is the first presidential candidate to make a campaign stop at Quora, she isn't the first politician to answer questions at the online forum.\nStops at online communities such as Quora are becoming increasingly valuable to candidates as social media plays a bigger role in how Americans consume political news and information.\nRick Friedman/rickfriedman.com/CorbisHillary Clinton on Tuesday ventured where no 2016 presidential candidate has dared when she went on Q&A service Quora to promote her bid for the White House.\nThe site has already become a favorite for Silicon Valley bigwigs to answer questions about the industry, or for employees to tell all about what it's like to work for a certain company.\nQuora representatives declined to discuss the number of users it has or the state of its revenue plans."}
