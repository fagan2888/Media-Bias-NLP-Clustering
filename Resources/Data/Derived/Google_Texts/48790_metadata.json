He leans in close, his eyes sparkle, and he says, \u201cWell, actually, Elsa, it was neat.\u201d He pauses with a dreamy expression on his face, then reiterates \u2013 \u201cit was neat.\u201d\n\nRizzo is a man with a distinctive presence. From the minute he walks into the Tombs Restaurant in Georgetown on a balmy afternoon, he gives off an air of formidable sophistication. Although he\u2019s now in his sixties, his eyes glimmer with nothing but youth. As we settle in at the bar and he orders a glass of pinot noir, his friendly demeanor and jovial attitude persist.\n\nThroughout his time at the agency, Rizzo was known for his colorful style. In most photos of him, he wears pink in some fashion, whether it\u2019s a pocket square or a bow tie. But on this autumn day, he wears a muted, academic ensemble \u2013 a tweed jacket, denim collarless shirt, and brown loafers. Retirement may have mellowed his wardrobe, but certainly not his spirit nor his opinions.\n\nOur conversation begins with the Paris terror attacks, arguably the most psychologically impactful event on the American public in recent memory. He quickly pronounces that, \u201cas horrendous as the [terrorist attacks in Paris were]\u2026the reaction doesn\u2019t come close to anything in the reaction after 9/11.\u201d\n\nHowever, he still sees Paris as a valuable catalyst for a broader discussion about terrorism to resurface in the public dialogue. \u201cParis can serve to remind people that there is still a significant terrorist threat out there\u2026that it\u2019s real, and that these terrorists are capable of planning and coordinating a highly sophisticated and ruthless kind of attack.\n\nWe\u2019re\u2026fourteen years after 9/11\u2026\u201d He pauses and asks, \u201chow old were you during 9/11?\u201d\n\n\u201cI was seven.\u201d\n\nRizzo chuckles. \u201cSo peoples\u2019 memories tend to fade,\u201d he finishes cynically, taking another sip of wine. \u201cI\u2019ve been lecturing around the country\u2026and I\u2019m struck\u2026that the students really don\u2019t have any real or firm recollection of the horror of 9/11. So, I mean, as terrible as it was, I think Paris could serve to\u2026really reignite this debate.\n\n\u201cSooner or later, there\u2019s gonna be another attack on the homeland. Probably not a plane, but something\u2026\u201d he pauses and ponders, then repeats himself. \u201cSomething. It\u2019s frightening.\u201d\n\nHe also ties surveillance into the Paris discussion. \u201cAn attack like this, coordinated, simultaneous\u2026these plotters had to have communicated with each other via some sort of encrypted communications,\u201d Rizzo gestures to my iPhone sitting on the bar and shrugs.\n\nIf Rizzo is correct, the balance between privacy and security could very well tip back towards security and post 9/11 policies in the post-Paris era. In fact, he believes the balance is much more tenuous than President Obama has portrayed it.\n\n\u201cPresident Obama was quoted once as saying, \u201cthe choice between privacy and security is a false choice.\u201d With all due respect, I disagree with that. It\u2019s a real choice, and it\u2019s a tough choice, especially in the balancing part.\u201d\n\nAccording to Rizzo, fears of intrusive government surveillance are hyped and unfounded. He seems frustrated with post-Snowden legislation and attempts by both the government and private companies in the U.S. to limit the surveillance capabilities of intelligence agencies.\n\n\u201cBelieve me, the CIA has no interest in prying into the private life of \u2013 you, or virtually any American,\u201d he laughs. \u201cThere\u2019s no time for it, there\u2019s no interest in it. So these fears about \u2018Big Brother\u2019 \u2013 it\u2019s just not the way the system really operates.\u201d\n\nRizzo is disdainful of those who harbor such fears, and especially those who act \u201cpromiscuously\u201d on them such as Edward Snowden, the famed NSA surveillance whistleblower, and John Kiriakou, a CIA torture whistleblower. He slams them both and argues that it\u2019s the responsibility of the CIA and NSA to spy on foreign governments \u2013 though one can only wonder what Germany and France would have to say to that.\n\n\u201cSnowden\u2026was\u202629 years old\u2026in Hawaii in a shack somewhere as a contractor for NSA, and he gets to decide what the world should know\u2026about espionage activities against foreign governments which is what, you know, that\u2019s what the CIA and NSA are supposed to do \u2013 that\u2019s the whole point \u2013 they\u2019re supposed to spy.\u201d\n\nAs for Kiriakou, Rizzo\u2019s criticism is more succinct and scathing.\n\n\u201cKiriakou \u2013 he\u2019s no Aldrich Ames. I mean, he\u2019s an idiot,\u201d Rizzo says without sympathy. \u201cHe wanted to be a big shot, that\u2019s why he did it.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve always thought that most people leak because there\u2019s a sense of grandiosity \u2013 that they know all the hot secrets\u2026so I think that\u2019s why lower-level people are involved.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The CIA's top lawyer met me in D.C.
