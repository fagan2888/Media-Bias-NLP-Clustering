It\u2019s the $93.7 million federal website ostensibly designed to move customers through the health insurance marketplace described as everything from \u201cglitchy\u201d to an utter fiasco.\n\n\u201cWe are experiencing some of the same slow systems everybody else is,\u201d Skemp said.\n\nSo is Arise Health Plan, the wholly owned subsidiary of WPS Health Insurance.\n\n\u201cWe have nine people enrolled so far, as of last week,\u201d said Ellen Foley, WPS vice president of corporate communications. \u201cWe suspect there are more pending in the exchange system, but they haven\u2019t gotten to us yet.\n\n\u201cWe are optimistic the marketplace technology will become easier to use.\u201d\n\nSo far, not so much.\n\nA Wisconsin Reporter review of the insurers in Wisconsin\u2019s federally controlled Health Insurance Marketplace seems to confirm what the state Office of the Commissioner of Insurance told the MacIver News Service earlier this week: There has been \u201cminimal participation\u201d in the exchange to date. OCI estimated the number of people signed up was fewer than 50.\n\n\u201cWe called all 13 carriers in the individual exchange and asked them. They gave us general numbers,\u201d said OCI spokesman J.P. Wieske. \u201cEverybody is aware of what\u2019s going on with the website; we wanted to see what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\nThe insurers who returned calls from Wisconsin Reporter all said the same thing: They are hearing an earful from would-be customers who keep getting kicked off the website.\n\n\u201cThe Federally Facilitated Marketplace (FFM) website is experiencing high volumes and significant access issues. Until these issues are resolved, be advised that connection times are very slow,\u201d Arise notes on its website.\n\nEven the insurers can\u2019t get on the site, and they\u2019re not getting much support from the federal government.\n\nSkemp said Gundersen Health Plan doesn\u2019t have a lot of \u201ccontact or direct interaction with the federal government these days.\u201d He said he tried to create an account at healthcare.gov. After two weeks and a lot of failed attempts, Skemp said he was able to do it. As soon as he tried to shop and do price comparisons, however, Skemp got an error message, \u201cNot Found.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been spending our own time online seeing if it\u2019s working better. It \u2018s really not. It\u2019s really slow.\u201d\n\nA Forbes piece published Wednesday suggests the reason for the glacial pace of the website involves consumer sticker shock.\n\n\u201c(The Department of Health and Human Services) didn\u2019t want users to see Obamacare\u2019s true costs,\u201d writes Forbes contributor Avik Roy.\n\nHe points to another report.\n\n\u201cHealthcare.gov was initially going to include an option to browse before registering,\u201d reports Christopher Weaver and Louise Radnofsky in the Wall Street Journal. \u201cBut that tool was delayed, people familiar with the situation said.\u201d Why was it delayed? \u201cAn HHS spokeswoman said the agency wanted to ensure that users were aware of their eligibility for subsidies that could help pay for coverage, before they started seeing the prices of policies.\u201d\n\nCompcare Health Services Insurance Corp., a subsidiary of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Wisconsin, has \u201cjust begun to receive confirmation of enrollment in the federal exchanges,\u201d said Scott Larrivee, spokesman for Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, wrote in an email to Wisconsin Reporter.\n\nWhile Larrivee said it\u2019s too early to provide specific enrollment details, the insurer has seen \u201cunprecedented call volumes and heavy web traffic for our exchange plans.\u201d The spokesman did not respond to a Wisconsin Reporter\u2019s follow-up email asking whether the calls were due to customer confusion and frustration over the federal website.\n\nPerhaps the big winner so far is Brookfield-based Common Ground Healthcare Cooperative, which, according to CEO Robert De Vita, counted 21 subscribers and a total of 27 members in the insurer\u2019s federally facilitated marketplace ranks as of Monday night.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not an apologist for what as a taxpayer you and I have paid for. Health insurance in this issue is as complicated as nuclear physics,\u201d De Vita said. \u201cThat does not change the infrastructure piece from being a poor performer. I\u2019m not a happy camper, I want to be selling this stuff.\u201d While the exchange is a \u201cchannel\u201d of business for the new insurer, De Vita said the cooperative isn\u2019t simply counting on Obamacare business.\n\nSkemp said Gundersen Health Plan put politics aside a long time ago. He urges patience with a the product and sounds optimistic the website will eventually perform up to its $94 million price tag. But so far, the insurer, perhaps like many others on the exchanges, has a \u201clong way to go to make\u201d projections on insured counts.\n\nMeanwhile, insurers have urged anxious Obamacare customers to hold off on requests for paper health insurance applications because, as Skemp put it, insurers haven\u2019t gotten clarification from HHS on what would happen to the documents after they are sent off, whether they would end up in a document \u201cblack hole.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s early on yet. We\u2019ve got to work through it,\u201d Skemp said. \u201cWe\u2019ll cross our fingers that it works in the next couple of weeks.\u201d\n\nContact M.D. Kittle at mkittle@watchdog.gov", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Three.\r\nThat\u2019s how many people had signed up for individual insurance \u2013 or, more aptly put, could sign up \u2013 with  Gundersen Health Plan, one of 13 insurers participating in the federal health-care exchange in Wisconsin.", "title": "WI health care exchange seeing few getting through - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/10/obamacare.gov_.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-10-17T11:56:12+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/111014/review-wi-health-care-exchange-seeing-few-getting-through/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "News", "tag": "Arise Health Plan,Blue Cross Blue Shield,Ellen Foley,Forbes,Greg Skemp,Gundersen Health Plan,Health Care,La Crosse,ObamaCare,Wall Street Journal,WPS Health Insurance", "published_time": "2013-10-16T12:37:35+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-17T11:56:12+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Three.\r\nThat\u2019s how many people had signed up for individual insurance \u2013 or, more aptly put, could sign up \u2013 with  Gundersen Health Plan, one of 13 insurers participating in the federal health-care exchange in Wisconsin.", "title": "WI health care exchange seeing few getting through - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/10/obamacare.gov_.jpg"}, "creator": "@wiswatchdog", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive"}, "article_summary": "So is Arise Health Plan, the wholly owned subsidiary of WPS Health Insurance.\nIt\u2019s the $93.7 million federal website ostensibly designed to move customers through the health insurance marketplace described as everything from \u201cglitchy\u201d to an utter fiasco.\nHealth insurance in this issue is as complicated as nuclear physics,\u201d De Vita said.\nSkemp said Gundersen Health Plan put politics aside a long time ago.\nThat\u2019s how many people had signed up for individual insurance \u2013 or, more aptly put, could sign up \u2013 with Gundersen Health Plan, one of 13 insurers participating in the federal health-care exchange in Wisconsin."}
