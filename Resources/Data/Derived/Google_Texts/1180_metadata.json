But there are ways to survive being the primary caregiver for a person with a progressive, degenerative, long-term disease.\n\n\u201cYou need to develop an attitude of creative indifference toward the emotional stress of caring for someone who is elderly, chronically ill or disabled,\u201d said Elaine K. Sanchez, author, speaker and cofounder of CaregiverHelp.com, a video-based caregiver support program.\n\nSanchez will share her ideas during \u201cFinding Hope, Humor and Heart in Caregiving,\u201d the annual education conference for families and professionals May 5, sponsored by the Alzheimer\u2019s Association.\n\nDuring a phone interview Tuesday, Sanchez gave a preview of what participants will learn. An attitude of \u201ccreative indifference,\u201d she explained, can help caregivers cope with the anger, guilt, depression and grief they experience.\n\n\u201cSo many times, especially with Alzheimer\u2019s patients, what is so difficult is that people are grieving the loss of a person they used to know. They get angry, from here to the moon, with the receiver, the disease, the family member who doesn\u2019t show up, the medical team, insurance, the Veterans Administration.\u201d\n\nAnd anger with all of that is justifiable, she said. \u201cSo I will talk about a strategy for dealing with those things. I will talk about the \u2018Three Fs of Flipping Out\u2019: Fear, frustration and fatigue.\u201d\n\nPersonal experience\n\nSanchez knows of what she speaks. She watched her aging mother care for her father, who had stroke-related dementia.\n\n\u201cFirst, you don\u2019t want to take your frustration out on a person who can\u2019t help it. So many things are out of the caregiver and care receiver\u2019s control.\u201d\n\nShe said there are ways make the situation more tolerable:\n\n\u2022 Become aware of the issues that cause the most stress. Name them and write them down.\n\n\u2022 Accept that your lives have changed, and there is no going back. This could be a long road ahead, with an outcome no one wants and many complex and complicating issues to deal with.\n\n\u2022 Take action. Figure out a plan, something you can actually do, and execute it. Or, she said, realize something is beyond your control to fix or improve. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of releasing your emotional attachment to it,\u201d she said.\n\nThe \u201cbiggest piece\u201d to successful caregiving, Sanchez said, is \u201clearning how to cope with emotions.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen her father was ill, Sanchez said she and her mother watched him change in ways they never anticipated.\n\n\u201cIn the second part of my talk, I will discuss managing dementia\u2019s challenging behaviors with an emphasis on inappropriate and surprising sexual behavior ... This is not surprising in stroke survivors, people with Alzheimer\u2019s, or people who take Dopamine to control the symptoms of Parkinson\u2019s Disease.\u201d\n\nShe also said caregivers should be aware of the \u201cthree don\u2019ts of dementia: Don\u2019t argue. Don\u2019t try to talk them out of something. And don\u2019t force them to remember.\u201d\n\nThere are better, more effective strategies to manage behavior, which will reduce stress for the caregiver and care receiver.\n\nThe third portion of Sanchez\u2019 talk on May 5 will be about depression, grief and survivor tips.\n\nLooking ahead\n\nBeing a family caregiver is becoming more and more typical. \u201cAlmost a third of adults in the U.S. are involved in caregiving \u2014 some for a couple of hours a week, and full time for others.\u201d\n\nSanchez said the problem is becoming more understood on numerous levels \u2014 important because of the advancing age of baby boomers.\n\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act has had an impact on this because hospitals reimburse on readmission and patient satisfaction. What they are realizing is if you keep a caregiver healthy and supported, you are more likely to reduce readmissions and increase patient satisfaction. Also, the government is realizing the economic benefit of unpaid caregivers.\u201d\n\nSanchez\u2019 mother had written her letters about her experience caring for her husband. \u201cShe wrote to me for over six years. I edited her letters into a book, which I finished and self-published in 2006.\u201d\n\nSanchez said her mom\u2019s letters \u201cwere like an episode of \u2018MASH\u2019 \u2014 you\u2019d laugh, cry and have hope for humanity.\u201d\n\nThe second edition of \u201cLetters from Madelyn: Chronicles of a Caregiver\u201d will be released later this month.\n\nContact reporter Mary Nugent at 896-7764.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Chico >> Nobody really thinks about it until it\u2019s personal.
