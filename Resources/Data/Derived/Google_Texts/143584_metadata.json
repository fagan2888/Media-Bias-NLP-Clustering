Some Republicans feel the same way about Obamacare. A \"Creepy Care-nival\" held on the National Mall in Washington, DC this week was intended to combine the two and make young people terrified of Obamacare.\n\nThe Creepy Care-nival featured knife throwing jugglers, a house call from Dr. Grim Reaper, and a virtual death panel.\n\nThe ghoulish displays were created by Generation Opportunity, the Koch brothers affiliated group that also produced the controversial \"Creepy Uncle Sam\" ads.\n\nTightrope walkers, acrobats, and clowns mingled with elected officials like Republican Reps. Paul Gosar of Arizona and Louie Gohmert of Texas.\n\nHere's what it looked like:\n\nThis actually happened to @RepGosar during a speech in front of the Capitol last night.

The youngish crowd of tourists, Washington types, and curious joggers enjoyed ominous palm readings, an impossible coin toss, and basketball with a ball too big for the hoop.\n\nObamacare palm readings pic.twitter.com/xnJyxEIAJM - Ben Siegel (@benyc) July 24, 2014\n\nThis is the prize you win when you play a game at the Creepy Careneval pic.twitter.com/qOtzrhJiUD - BuzzFeed Benny (@bennyjohnson) July 23, 2014\n\nThe event's main attraction, a \"creepy hospital,\" took participants through a hospital run by \"Dr. Grim Reaper.\"\n\nA ward in Generation Opportunity's \"creepy hospital\" pic.twitter.com/npgZyg6XdR - Ben Siegel (@benyc) July 24, 2014\n\nThe tour ended in a room filled with signs listing infamous episodes in American public health history including the forced lobotomization of World War II veterans recently detailed in the Wall Street Journal, and a mass sterilization program whose victims were awarded compensation in 2012.
