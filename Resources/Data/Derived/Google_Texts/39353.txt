Ryan O’Reilly might miss Wednesday’s game against Ottawa because of a bizarre shoulder injury he suffered in celebrating a goal Tuesday night.

O’Reilly hurt a shoulder while celebrating the Avs’ third goal, by Paul Stastny. Essentially, he got it jammed while extending his afms into the group hug. The Avs say he is day-to-day, so we’ll see tomorrow if he plays or not against Ottawa.

Video of the injury:



Nathan MacKinnon did not practice today, but is expected to play against the Sens. He took a puck off the boot last night and the foot is sore.

David Van Der Gulik has been called up from Lake Erie to potentially fill O’Reilly’s spot on the roster.
