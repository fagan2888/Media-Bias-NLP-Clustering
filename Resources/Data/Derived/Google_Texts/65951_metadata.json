Ryan Ellis got the winner with less than three minutes left in the extra period.\n\nMark Scheifele took the puck on a breakaway before feeding it to defenceman Ellis who beat Sweden\u2019s goaltender, Anders Nilsson.\n\n\"I'm happy we won, but we have some things we have to clean up,\" Canada goaltender Ben Scrivens said\n\nThe United States claimed their win against Finland, scoring after just 19 seconds through Brock Nelson. They then waited until the third period to extend their advantage when Tyler Johnson fired a wrist shot over the right shoulder of goaltender Pekka Rinne, with Seth Jones getting his second assist of the evening.\n\nTukka Mantyla made the game interesting with just over three minutes to go when he forced the puck past Tim Thomas, who made 22 saves overall. However Johnson scored with less than a minute on the clock to seal the win.\n\n(editing by Clare Lovell)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Reuters Editorial", "Author": "Reuters Editorial", "DCSext.PageNumber": 1, "twitter": {"description": "Canada came from behind to triumph in a re-run of the Olympic men's ice hockey final, beating Sweden 3-2 in overtime on Sunday and moving top of Group A at the World Ice Hockey Championships.", "creator": "@Reuters", "image": "http://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20140518&t=2&i=897876676&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=LYNXMPEA4H0A6", "title": "Canada top group and U.S. reach quarters", "site": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "DCSext.rChannel": "Article - News", "sailthru.tags": "US, ICE, HOCKEY, WORLD", "DCSext.ChannelList": "sportsNews;Retirement;JackDaniels;ford;ToyotaPrius;everything;Continental;Shell;Amtrak;Amtrak2;yahoo3;HighEndSports;Suntrust_SmallBiz;ShellEnergy;AllianzRetirement;AllianzInvestments;HSBC_US;Goldman;everythingButHugin;OutloudFeed;Allianz;JPMorgan;CFA;jpGambaroPeople;olympics2012(us);samsung;sweden;canada;Pfizersafe;cfaglobal;merrilledge;aa48hours;hockey;citianniversary;accenture;greenpeace;MLGZero;fedex_neg;ubs;Bosneg;Intel", "keywords": "US,ICE,HOCKEY,WORLD,Belarus,United States,Sweden,East European Countries,Canada,Content produced in Bangalore,Ice Hockey,Western Europe,Financials (Legacy),Sport,Finland", "DCSext.ContentType": "Article", "description": "Canada came from behind to triumph in a re-run of the Olympic men's ice hockey final, beating Sweden 3-2 in overtime on Sunday and moving top of Group A at the World Ice Hockey Championships.", "WT.cg_n": "Life", "DCSext.rCountry": "BETAUS", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "sportsNews", "sailthru.date": "2014-05-18T17:58:32+0000", "sailthru.title": "Canada top group and U.S. reach quarters", "DCSext.ContentHeadline": "Canada+top+group+and+U.S.+reach+quarters", "DCSext.ContentID": "USKBN0DY0MA20140518", "WT.cg_s": "Sports", "WT.z_inlinetype": "false", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20140518&t=2&i=897876676&w=&fh=50&fw=50&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=LYNXMPEA4H0A6", "news_keywords": "US;ICE;HOCKEY;WORLD;Belarus;United States;Sweden;East European Countries;Canada;Content produced in Bangalore;Ice Hockey;Western Europe;Financials (Legacy);Sport;Finland", "DCSext.ContentID_sportsNews": "USKBN0DY0MA20140518", "robots": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "DCSext.PageTotal": 1, "DCSext.rAuthor": "Reuters Editorial", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "sailthru.description": "Canada came from behind to triumph in a re-run of the Olympic men's ice hockey final, beating Sweden 3-2 in overtime on Sunday and moving top of Group A at the World Ice Hockey Championships.", "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/sports/article", "viewport": "width=1100", "sailthru.contenttype": "Article", "WT.z_navid": "nav-Text-sportsNews", "site edition": "Reuters", "og": {"site_name": "Reuters", "description": "Canada came from behind to triumph in a re-run of the Olympic men's ice hockey final, beating Sweden 3-2 in overtime on Sunday and moving top of Group A at the World Ice Hockey Championships.", "title": "Canada top group and U.S. reach quarters", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20140518&t=2&i=897876676&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=LYNXMPEA4H0A6", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ice-hockey-world-idUSKBN0DY0MA20140518", "article": {"section": "Life", "tag": "US,ICE,HOCKEY,WORLD,Belarus,United States,Sweden,East European Countries,Canada,Content produced in Bangalore,Ice Hockey,Western Europe,Financials (Legacy),Sport,Finland", "published_time": "2014-05-18T17:58:32+0000", "modified_time": "2014-05-18T17:58:32+0000", "author": "Reuters Editorial"}, "type": "article"}, "REVISION_DATE": "Sun May 18 17:58:32 UTC 2014", "DCSext.contentversion": "original", "sailthru.image.full": "http://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20140518&t=2&i=897876676&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=LYNXMPEA4H0A6"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf5a3\"", "article_summary": "MINSK Canada came from behind to triumph in a re-run of the Olympic men's ice hockey final, beating Sweden 3-2 in overtime on Sunday and moving top of Group A at the World Ice Hockey Championships.\nCanada's Ryan Ellis (L) scores past Sweden's goalie Anders Nilsson (R) during the extra time period of their men's ice hockey World Championship Group A game at Chizhovka Arena in Minsk May 18, 2014.\nMark Scheifele took the puck on a breakaway before feeding it to defenceman Ellis who beat Sweden\u2019s goaltender, Anders Nilsson.\nRyan Ellis got the winner with less than three minutes left in the extra period.\nIn the third period Lindstrom went off injured and the Canadians equalised when Kevin Bieksa scored on the powerplay with 13 minutes to go."}
