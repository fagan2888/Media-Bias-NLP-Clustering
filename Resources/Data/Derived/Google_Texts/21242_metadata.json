The survey was conducted by Harris Poll on behalf of CareerBuilder among 433 full-time workers ages 60 and up and 2,201 hiring and human resources managers.\n\nBut not everyone is feeling optimistic, 10% of respondents report they will never be able to retire, holding steady from 2013\u2019s 11%. Half of the respondents say they will be able to retire within four years, up from 47% last year.\n\nBut retirement doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the end of one\u2019s work life altogether, the survey finds, as 45% saying they will take on either full-time or part-time work post-retirement. This is a drop of 15% from last year\u2019s 60%.\n\nMichael Erwin, senior career advisor at CareerBuilder, says the drop in those looking for work post-retirement can be attributed to the Affordable Care Act.\n\nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThe number one concern for aging workers is always finances, and number two is always health care,\u201d Erwin says. \u201cThe ACA could have definitely had a major role in this. They are also feeling more comfortable with their money and won\u2019t have to go out and look for another job after retiring.\u201d\n\nErwin predicts that the number of retirees seeking work in their golden years will continue to decrease.\n\n\u201cNot all workers approaching retirement age feel they can retire, but we are moving in that direction, and the numbers are getting higher,\u201d he says. \u201cWe will see this as the economy continues to improve and the stock market stays strong. People feel more confident not only saying, \u2018I will retire,\u2019 but also telling their employer that they will definitely leave on this date.\u201d\n\nOne interesting finding in the report, Erwin says, is that more men are feeling confident about retiring compared to the women surveyed. Seventy-one percent of women said they would be more likely to delay retirement, compared to 49% of men. What\u2019s more, 18% of women ages 60 and older say they will not likely ever be able to retire, compared to just 7% of men.\n\n\u201cMaybe women are being more objective about needing a certain amount of money to retire, compared to men just keeping their eye on the [retirement] prize,\u201d he says.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.modified": "2016-01-07 11:47:11 EST", "dcterms.abstract":
