Schneiderman announced today an investigation by his office found Emblem Health Inc. incorrectly processed 255 claims, resulting in members being incorrectly charged for anesthesia costs related to colonoscopies.\n\nA colonoscopy is an exam used to detect changes and abnormalities in the large intestine and rectum.\n\nAs part of a settlement with the AG's office, Emblem is refunding nearly $400,000 to affected customers.\n\nUnder the federal Affordable Care Act, health plans must cover in full -- without member co-payments, coinsurance or deductibles -- preventive colonoscopies. Because anesthesia is necessary in these procedures, it too should be covered in full without any cost to members, according to the AG's office.\n\nThe AG's office received a complaint from a member who received a bill from an anesthesiologist for $1,320 in connection with a colonoscopy provided by an in-network provider. The anesthesiologist did not participate in Emblem's provider network.\n\nEmblem paid the anesthesiologist $924 and told the member he was on the hook for the remaining $396. The AG's Office contacted Emblem and said the customer should not have been charged anything for anesthesia. Emblem acknowledged it processed the claim incorrectly, according to the AG's office. An analysis showed the insurer was incorrectly making customers pay a share of anesthesia costs for in-network preventive colonoscopies when out-of-network anesthesiologists were involved.\n\nConsumers who believe they have been treated unfairly by a heath insurer can call the state Attorney General's Health Care Helpline at 800-428-9071.\n\nContact James T.
