Bernie Sanders (I-VT) is not being realistic about having millions of people march on Washington D.C. demanding single payer health care.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nWhen asked if it is realistic that Sanders is planing to create a revolution that is going to put pressure on congress get things passed, Axelrod said, \u201cI had this discussion with him, he was on my podcast a few weeks ago. I asked him about health care, specifically because he\u2019s calling for single payer health care system. I pointed out that we couldn\u2019t even get a public option within the proposal that we had for the Affordable Care Act because some Democrats were resistant to it. He said, well I\u2019m going to have millions of people march on Washington and representatives will look out the window and they will see that. The fact is majority of Americans don\u2019t support single payer. I happen to think it\u2019s a good idea but I respect the fact that a lot of Americans don\u2019t. I think Bernie Sanders knows that he\u2019s been in congress for 25 years, he\u2019s a very experienced legislator and he knows what limitations are. He\u2019s speaking to people\u2019s aspirations and he\u2019s doing well with it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Axelrod: Sanders is Not Realistic, 'He's Speaking to People's Aspirations'", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Axelrod: Sanders is Not Realistic, 'He's Speaking to People's Aspirations'", "title": "Axelrod: Sanders is Not Realistic, 'He's Speaking to People's Aspirations' - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/10/alxel.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2015/10/18/axelrod-sanders-is-not-realistic-hes-speaking-to-peoples-aspirations/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Axelrod: Sanders is Not Realistic, 'He's Speaking to People's Aspirations'", "creator": "@pamkeyNEN", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/10/alxel.jpg", "title": "Axelrod: Sanders is Not Realistic, 'He's Speaking to People's Aspirations' - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Axelrod: Sanders is Not Realistic, 'He's Speaking to People's Aspirations'", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "David Axelrod", "published_time": "2015-10-18T11:42:42-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart TV,2016 Presidential Race,Obamacare"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "I asked him about health care, specifically because he\u2019s calling for single payer health care system.\nHe\u2019s speaking to people\u2019s aspirations and he\u2019s doing well with it.\u201d\nI think Bernie Sanders knows that he\u2019s been in congress for 25 years, he\u2019s a very experienced legislator and he knows what limitations are.\nThe fact is majority of Americans don\u2019t support single payer.\nI happen to think it\u2019s a good idea but I respect the fact that a lot of Americans don\u2019t."}
