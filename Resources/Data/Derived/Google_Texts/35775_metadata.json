He was 91 last year when he told the story again, propped in a wheelchair in the rehabilitation unit of a nursing home where it seemed as though age and infirmity had put a different kind of price on his head. Craning his neck, he sought the eyes of his daughter, Maureen Stefanides, who had promised to get him out of this place. \u201cI want to go home, to my books and my music,\u201d he said, his voice whispery but intense. He was still her handsome father, the song-and-dance man of her childhood, with a full head of wavy hair and blue eyes that lit up when he talked. But he was gaunt now, warped like a weathered plank, perhaps by late effects of an old stroke, certainly by muscle atrophy and bad circulation in his legs. Now she was determined to fulfill her father\u2019s dearest wish, the wish so common among frail, elderly people: to die at home. But it seemed as if all the forces of the health care system were against her \u2014 hospitals, nursing homes, home health agencies, insurance companies, and the shifting crosscurrents of public health care spending. Her father had been discharged by a hospital to a nursing home like this one, supposedly for rehabilitation, so many times that even she had lost count. The stays, long or short, had only left him weaker, harder to care for at home with a shrinking allotment of help from aides and more prone to the infections that sent him back to the hospital. This time she had fiercely opposed his being discharged to anywhere but home, a small walk-up apartment in Manhattan that her parents shared for half a century before her mother\u2019s death. Yet over her protests and his own, he had been transferred here anyway, to Jewish Home Lifecare in Morningside Heights, a sprawling institution an hour from where she lived. Later, he would ask, \u201cAre you sure you didn\u2019t put me here?\u201d \u201cNo matter what I do, they want you in a nursing home,\u201d Ms. Stefanides told him, promising the placement would be temporary. \u201cI think they\u2019re making money off you.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a lot more to the story \u2014 read the whole piece at The New York Times.\n\nAnd for much more on end-of-life issues, also check out Bill Moyers\u2019 groundbreaking four-part series, \u201cOn Our Own Terms: Moyers on Dying.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Skewed financial incentives and poor communication between clinicians and families can make dying in America a nightmare.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "BillMoyers.com", "description": "Skewed financial incentives and poor communication between clinicians and families can make dying in America a nightmare.", "title": "How America's Health Care System Can Make Death With Dignity Impossible | BillMoyers.com", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://dy00k1db5oznd.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/5340117676_9df664bf6d_z.jpg", "height": 360}, "updated_time": "2015-02-09T16:46:58-04:00", "url": "http://billmoyers.com/2014/09/26/americas-health-care-system-can-make-death-dignity-impossible/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Skewed financial incentives and poor communication between clinicians and families can make dying in America a nightmare.", "creator": "@BillMoyersHQ", "image": "http://dy00k1db5oznd.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/5340117676_9df664bf6d_z.jpg", "title": "How America's Health Care System Can Make Death With Dignity Impossible | BillMoyers.com", "site": "@BillMoyersHQ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "article": {"section": "Blog", "tag": "widget", "published_time": "2014-09-26T13:54:37-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-09T16:46:58-04:00"}, "pubdate": 20140926, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda53b\"", "article_summary": "But it seemed as if all the forces of the health care system were against her \u2014 hospitals, nursing homes, home health agencies, insurance companies, and the shifting crosscurrents of public health care spending.\n\u201cI think they\u2019re making money off you.\u201dThere\u2019s a lot more to the story \u2014 read the whole piece at The New York Times.\nNow she was determined to fulfill her father\u2019s dearest wish, the wish so common among frail, elderly people: to die at home.\nCraning his neck, he sought the eyes of his daughter, Maureen Stefanides, who had promised to get him out of this place.\nBernstein writes:Joseph Andrey was 5 years old in 1927 when his impoverished mother sold him to the manager of a popular vaudeville act."}
