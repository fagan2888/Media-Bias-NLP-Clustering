Decades later, at the height of the Iraq and Afghanistan warfare, 60 percent of new enlisted recruits met the high quality standards.\n\nTroubling, however, is that the same can\u2019t be said about military officers \u2013 or at least those in the Marine Corps who were targeted for the research. An analysis of the test scores of 46,000 officers who took the Marine Corps\u2019 required General Classification Test (GCT) found a \u201csteady and significant\u201d decline over the past 34 years.\n\nRelated: House GOP\u2019s Creative Accounting Lifts Defense Budget\n\nThe GCT dates back to World War II, when it was developed to help classify incoming servicemen. Designed to have a mean score of 100, with a standard deviation of 20, the Marines used 120 as the bar for entry into Marine Officer Candidate School (OCS).\n\nAccording to the new findings, 85 percent of those taking the test in 1980 exceeded a score of 120, which was the cut-off score for officers in World War II. However, in 2014, only 59 percent exceeded that score, according to the Brookings study. In short, over 34 years, the average score decreased by 6.6 percent, from 130.9 to 122.1.\n\nThe provocative research was conducted by Michael Klein, a professor at Tufts University\u2019s Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy in Boston, and Matthew Cancian, a graduate student at Fletcher and a former Marine who served in Afghanistan.\n\nIt is always dangerous to put too much stock in aptitude and intelligence tests in assessing the quality of military officers. The Marines, of course, have a long, proud history of military service, and many of their officers have displayed enormous courage and resourcefulness in leading their troops into battle.\n\nMoreover, President Obama recently tapped Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford to become the next chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the highest military position in government. Still, Klein and Cancian say their new findings are significant, and raise the concern about whether \u201ctoday\u2019s less qualified officer candidates will be tomorrow\u2019s senior military leaders.\u201d\n\nRelated: Obama to name Marine general to become top U.S. military officer\n\n\u201cWhat has been the impact of this drop in quality on the effectiveness of the military?\u201d they wrote. \u201cAnswering this question is beyond the scope of this paper. Given the myriad studies associating performance with intellect, however, it is hard to imagine anything other than a seriously deleterious impact on the quality of officers and, by extension, on the quality and efficacy of the military.\u201d\n\nSo what explains the disparity in the test score trends between rank-and-file military recruits and the supposed cream of the crop who are being recruited and groomed to become commissioned officers?\n\nAccording to Klein and Cancian, the answer may be counter-intuitive: Only college graduates are considered by the Marines to become commissioned officers. But with so many more people going to college these days and getting four-year degrees, the overall quality of the college graduates may be in decline, they say.\n\nRelated: The Dirty Truth About the Marines\u2019 Clean Audit\n\nThe authors note that the decrease of GCT scores over time correlates to an increase in the college participation rate during that same period. \u201cCollege participation rate has increased and there\u2019s the requirement you have to have a college degree to become an officer,\u201d Klein said in an interview Monday. \u201cSo the pool has been expanded in a way where sort of less qualified people are in the pool.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe looked at other things too,\u201d Klein explained. \u201cSome people thought it might be because of the expansion of affirmative action. We actually find that years in which there are more incoming women or African-American officers, the average in those years, everything else being constant, is higher. And as for Hispanic officers, whatever contribution that makes to the lowering of scores is really minimal.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt really seems to be the college participation rate effect,\u201d he concluded. \u201cWhat happens is the pool of potential officer candidates is now larger but less strong.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "When the United States ended the draft in 1973 and gradually shifted to an all-volunte", "title": "New Study Suggests Marine COs May Not Be Up to Grade", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/07/28/New-Study-Suggests-Marine-COs-May-Not-Be-Grade", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/02112014_Marines.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/07/28/New-Study-Suggests-Marine-COs-May-Not-Be-Grade", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/02112014_Marines.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "When the United States ended the draft in 1973 and gradually shifted to an all-volunte", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcd9c\"", "article_summary": "Troubling, however, is that the same can\u2019t be said about military officers \u2013 or at least those in the Marine Corps who were targeted for the research.\nIt is always dangerous to put too much stock in aptitude and intelligence tests in assessing the quality of military officers.\n\u201cCollege participation rate has increased and there\u2019s the requirement you have to have a college degree to become an officer,\u201d Klein said in an interview Monday.\nDesigned to have a mean score of 100, with a standard deviation of 20, the Marines used 120 as the bar for entry into Marine Officer Candidate School (OCS).\nRelated: Army\u2019s Plans to Cut 60,000 Could Be a Major Blow to the EconomyNow we are getting some answers."}
