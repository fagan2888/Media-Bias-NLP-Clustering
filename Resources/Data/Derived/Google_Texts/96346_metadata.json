The Forum on Graduate Rights student group later labeled Wednesday a \u201cday of action\u201d instead after talking with MU administrators about their demands.\n\nGraduate student Anahita Zare, a Forum on Graduate Rights spokeswoman, said the group encouraged students who feel comfortable leaving work at their assistantships or not attending class Wednesday to help with the group\u2019s education efforts. Students were stationed around campus throughout the day, and a rally and march were planned for noon at the Columns.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re calling it a celebration because the,\u201d administration\u2019s \u201ccommunication thus far has been a small step, but a step nonetheless,\u201d Zare said. \u201cAnd we want to use this gathering to draw attention to the issues that we as graduate students face.\u201d\n\nMore than 60 MU departments sent the Forum on Graduate Rights letters supporting graduate students, with some backing the initial walkout idea and promising not to penalize students for participating. A Department of Anthropology statement said it supports a walkout and that some faculty would cancel classes to join graduate students in solidarity.\n\nSchool of Journalism graduate faculty said in a statement that they would not penalize graduate student employees who participate in a walkout should one occur. Graduate students are \u201ccrucial\u201d and a \u201ctremendous source of pride\u201d for the journalism school, the statement said.\n\nThe noon rally and march were meant to celebrate the important role graduate students have on campus, Zare said.\n\nLast school year, graduate students taught 2,325 of 16,946 class sections at MU, university spokeswoman Mary Jo Banken said. The university\u2019s 6,266 graduate students also contribute to research, which helps boost MU\u2019s status with the Association of American Universities.\n\nUniversity officials have said MU cannot guarantee health insurance assistance next school year for graduate student employees. A task force is assessing the university\u2019s options this fall, and Chancellor R. Bowen Loftin said a decision will be made in January.\n\nThe health insurance issue has been resolved for now, but the decision was \u201cthe spark that lit a long-accumulated pile of kindling,\u201d a Forum on Graduate Rights letter said. The group, which formed after MU said students no longer would receive insurance subsidies, sent the letter to members of the university community, including undergraduate students and their parents, this week.\n\nEric Scott, graduate student with the Forum on Graduate Rights, said he thought Loftin\u2019s response and decision to reissue insurance subsidies for this year was a good first step.\n\nLoftin\u2019s decision led the group to change its plans of a walkout to a day of graduate student celebration, advocacy and solidarity to draw attention to the group\u2019s demands: better living wages, full tuition waivers, subsidized healthcare, international student health subsidies, on-campus housing, on-campus child care and an elimination of fees.\n\nThe lack of communication and student input in the initial decision to stop providing insurance subsidies sparked a conversation among graduate students about unionizing. Scott said any efforts to unionize would be an independent student effort and would not go through an official student group. The Forum on Graduate Rights has a committee devoted to discussing the possibility.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;polling-uri=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=1;polling-uri2=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=2;polling-uri3=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=3;polling-uri4=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=4;polling-uri5=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=5; cycle=1", "googlebot": "noarchive", "application-name": "Columbia Tribune", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/columbiatribune.com/content/tncms/live/global/resources/images/_site/windows8_favs/wide.png?_dc=1372340732", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/columbiatribune.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/8/c8/8c8cda72-a99f-5860-a6b1-d909fd092d43/55de0c837050f.image.jpg?resize=800%2C533"}, "description": "University of Missouri graduate students were taking part in a \u201cday of action\u201d Wednesday \u2014 the latest turn in a battle between the students and MU administrators over a list of student grievances.", "site": "@columbiatribune", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Fight between MU administration, graduate students leads to 'day of action'"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#065874", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/columbiatribune.com/content/tncms/live/global/resources/images/_site/windows8_favs/tiny.png?_dc=1372340614", "og": {"site_name": "Columbia Daily Tribune", "description": "University of Missouri graduate students were taking part in a \u201cday of action\u201d Wednesday \u2014 the latest turn in a battle between the students and MU administrators over a list of student grievances.", "title": "Fight between MU administration, graduate students leads to 'day of action'", "url": "http://www.columbiatribune.com/news/education/fight-between-mu-administration-graduate-students-leads-to-day-of/article_c28c1cde-4dae-5c7c-a22f-202d4fb93eee.html", "image": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/columbiatribune.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/8/c8/8c8cda72-a99f-5860-a6b1-d909fd092d43/55de0c837050f.image.jpg?resize=1000%2C666", "type": "article"}, "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/columbiatribune.com/content/tncms/live/global/resources/images/_site/windows8_favs/large.png?_dc=1372340596", "p": {"domain_verify": "e84f2ccdbb23b2303cfa08c12e9bd926"}, "fb": {"app_id": 299470460147166}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/columbiatribune.com/content/tncms/live/global/resources/images/_site/windows8_favs/t-badge_144.png?_dc=1372343381", "keywords": "university of missouri,graduate students,health insurance subsidies,walk out,forum on graduate rights", "msvalidate.01": "1E3A617C7822235CF7453A03AC560148", "google-site-verification": "Pa-FtOcowtRH8XQjoX9dIrD_ncPLS80pMIWeoJZyZnA", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/columbiatribune.com/content/tncms/live/global/resources/images/_site/windows8_favs/square.png?_dc=1372340606", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes", "description": "University of Missouri graduate students were taking part in a \u201cday of action\u201d Wednesday \u2014 the latest turn in a battle between the students and MU administrators over a list of student grievances."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd111d\"", "article_summary": "The university\u2019s 6,266 graduate students also contribute to research, which helps boost MU\u2019s status with the Association of American Universities.\nRelated article: MU graduate students to plan next steps after march highlights student issuesYou must login to view the full content on this page.\nThe noon rally and march were meant to celebrate the important role graduate students have on campus, Zare said.\nThe Forum on Graduate Rights student group later labeled Wednesday a \u201cday of action\u201d instead after talking with MU administrators about their demands.\nGraduate students are \u201ccrucial\u201d and a \u201ctremendous source of pride\u201d for the journalism school, the statement said."}
