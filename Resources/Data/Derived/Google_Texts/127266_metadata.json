Scott P. Brown may not have officially announced his candidacy for New Hampshire\u2019s Senate seat, but former Sen. Bob Smith has \u2014 sort of.\n\nThe Republican lawmaker has filed papers for the New Hampshire Senate seat he held for 12 years \u2014 though he hasn\u2019t exactly announced his candidacy formally.\n\nHe is, however, hitting the D.C. circuit in search of money and support. And HOH had the unplanned pleasure of sitting next to him on his return flight from Baltimore to Manchester, N.H., on Thursday.\n\nIf you ask Smith, he has every intention of beating sitting New Hampshire Democrat Jeanne Shaheen and fellow Senate alumnus Brown.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not running for my health. I\u2019m serious,\u201d Smith told HOH over the course of a roughly 45-minute discussion that ranged from the current race to the sheer magnitude of the universe. (He couldn\u2019t seem to shake a recent Discovery Channel special on the solar system.)\n\nI was seated next to Smith by chance and initially listened to him discuss some internal strategy with his campaign manager, Sam Pimm, before revealing myself to be a reporter.\n\nSmith had spent the previous night at a fundraiser with about 40 people \u2014 a detail he and his campaign manager were contemplating leaking to New Hampshire political reporter John DiStaso of the Manchester Union Leader \u2014 and he and Pimm were discussing such practical matters as buying a campaign van in place of a bus to save money.\n\nSmith made it clear, throughout the course of the conversation, that his conservative principles applied just as much to his campaign as they do to his politics. Smith, off the top of his head, was able to provide price quotes for the various flights to New Hampshire that night \u2014 hence the reason he was taking a Southwest flight out of Baltimore and not the pricier, but more convenient, trip from Ronald Reagan National Airport.\n\nHe also acknowledged that Brown and Shaheen will have more money in the race, but noted that he\u2019d been outspent in races before and still won because of a superior ground game.\n\nSmith didn\u2019t seem scared of a bruising GOP primary with Brown. In fact, his initial reaction was to joke about it.\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d he asked facetiously.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re running. That\u2019s his decision to make,\u201d Smith said of Brown\u2019s nebulous position.\n\nHe suggested that the race between himself and Brown was one between a moderate and a conservative \u2014 something that didn\u2019t typically end well for the more moderate primary contender.\n\nSmith also questioned Brown\u2019s motives for office, noting that Brown declined to run for governor of Massachusetts because he said he wanted to spend more time with his family.\n\nBut Smith also expressed a desire to keep the race about policy, not personalities.\n\nHe refused to call Brown, who recently moved from Massachusetts to New Hampshire, a \u201ccarpetbagger.\u201d Smith himself has run for Senate twice in Florida, once in 2004 and then again in 2010.\n\nPer Smith, this race is really about Obamacare \u2014 the issue that seemed to motivate him to run for Senate again.\n\nHe spoke at length about the health care overhaul\u2019s effect on medical innovation in the United States, and joked that even though it was a \u201ctrite\u201d exercise to call the impending election the most important one in American history, it might actually be true in 2014.\n\nSmith also had some choice words for the current state of Congress. He bemoaned the \u201cbastardization\u201d of regular order and showed some disdain for the current crop of junior Republicans, including Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas, Mike Lee of Utah and Rand Paul of Kentucky.\n\n\u201cThe Senate is not designed for people who are impatient, unfortunately,\" he said.\n\nSmith said he didn\u2019t know what committees he\u2019d want to serve on if he were elected, but he\u2019d likely have some latitude to decide, given his seniority within Congress. He said he wanted to avoid the Appropriations Committee because they spend money, something he remains averse to as a conservative. The assignment that seemed most appealing is his former post on Armed Services.\n\nCommittee spots are the least of Smith\u2019s worries. A recent poll found Brown well ahead of Smith and other contenders in a theoretical GOP showdown.\n\nBut, as Smith noted, the New Hampshire primary \u2014 scheduled for Sept. 9 \u2014 is still \u201cinsanely\u201d far off.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ex-Sen.
