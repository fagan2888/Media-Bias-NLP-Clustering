Because, when you think about it, it wasn\u2019t really Republican voters he was talking about. None of them were gung-ho about government-administered healthcare, regardless of Gruber\u2019s slick comic-book presentation.\n\nWhich probably explains why the White House, instead of laughing off Gruber\u2019s comments as yet another \u201cfaux-scandal\u201d designed to keep Darrell Issa busy in the Congressional off-season, they\u2019re meeting the comments head on \u2013 with an outright denial that Jonathan Gruber had absolutely anything at all to do with the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAn administration official also noted to TPM that \u2014 while Gruber is often described as an \u201carchitect\u201d of Obamacare because he was a key consultant to the administration and was heavily involved in developing the Massachusetts health reform law that served as a starting point for the ACA \u2014 \u201che did not work in the White House or play the same role in developing the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nThat begs the question: what, exactly, was Jonathan Gruber doing for the Health and Human Services department that earned him $400,000? Interior decorating?\n\nGruber has been a go-to voice for reporters seeking a respected academic view on health care reform costs \u2014 and as far as I can tell, few if any knew that in March he was awarded a $95,000 contract with HHS and in June a $297,600 contract with HHS for providing \u201cTechnical Assistance in Evaluating Options for National Healthcare Reform.\u201d\n\nI guess they\u2019re technically correct. He didn\u2019t work directly with the White House. He worked with HHS and directly with Congress, which was ultimately responsible for developing and executing the healthcare reform bill itself, although it does seem like he authored a few op-eds defending things like the \u201cCadillac tax\u201d that \u201creduced incentives for employers to provide excessively generous insurance.\u201d And he didn\u2019t play exactly the same role as he did in developing Massachusetts health care plan, because the plan itself was already developed. He, apparently, helped Congress tailor it to a national audience.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 1742097289343962}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "generator": "WordPress 4.4"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1dca\"", "article_summary": "He didn\u2019t work directly with the White House.\nJonathan Gruber broke his silence yesterday with an interview on MSNBC, but the \u201cstupidity of the American voter\u201d is still dogging the White House, because while nearly everyone might believe that our representative democracy is run largely by idiots, most people \u2013 namely the Democratic voters that helped to pass Obamacare \u2013 don\u2019t like to hear it said outright.\nWhich probably explains why the White House, instead of laughing off Gruber\u2019s comments as yet another \u201cfaux-scandal\u201d designed to keep Darrell Issa busy in the Congressional off-season, they\u2019re meeting the comments head on \u2013 with an outright denial that Jonathan Gruber had absolutely anything at all to do with the Affordable Care Act.\nBecause, when you think about it, it wasn\u2019t really Republican voters he was talking about.\nNone of them were gung-ho about government-administered healthcare, regardless of Gruber\u2019s slick comic-book presentation."}
