And in more than 30 years in government, I\u2019ve never seen a law get so little recognition for doing so much good so quickly.\n\nThe right measure of the ACA isn\u2019t whether it avoids political controversy; it\u2019s whether it makes America better by achieving its five most fundamental goals: expanding health-insurance coverage, lowering costs and promoting fiscal responsibility, increasing quality through innovation, protecting seniors and delivering peace of mind to American families by guaranteeing essential rights in dealing with insurance companies.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBy that standard the law is already a success. Health insurance has expanded. More than 5 million Americans have signed up for coverage through federal and state marketplaces; millions have been determined eligible for Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program; and 3 million young adults gained insurance through their parents\u2019 coverage. Even more compelling than statistics are the letters hard-working Americans are sharing with the president. Their unscripted and private testimonials are building a lasting record of the life-changing\u2014and often lifesaving\u2014impacts the ACA is having. One woman from Colorado shared what the peace of mind of having coverage meant to her. \u201cAfter using my new insurance for the first time, you probably heard my sigh of relief from the White House,\u201d she wrote to President Obama. \u201cI felt like a human being again. I felt that I had value.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, costs are coming down. The Congressional Budget Office found the health care law is making significant contributions to fiscal responsibility. The CBO\u2019s most recent estimates show that repealing the law would actually increase deficits by $1.7 trillion over the next 20 years. Moreover, average premiums for coverage through the marketplaces are about 15 percent lower than the CBO previously projected.\n\nThere\u2019s more good news when it comes to health care and Medicare spending. The rate of increase in real health spending per person is at its lowest point in 50 years and more than 3 percentage points under the historical average, according to recent data. Growth in the average cost of care for a person enrolled in Medicare is also at unusually low levels, and if that success is maintained, it will translate into trillions in savings over the decades to come. Those savings can be used to pay down our deficit or invest in infrastructure, education, innovation and other key national priorities.\n\nJust three months after the law was signed, House Republicans sounded a warning on jobs and released a report claiming the ACA was \u201cmaking it harder to put people back to work. By signing ObamaCare into law, President Obama effectively signed pink slips for millions of American workers who will lose their jobs or be denied new jobs.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not what the facts say. In the 10 years before the law was passed, 3.6 million private-sector jobs were lost. Since its passage, more than 8.5 million private sector jobs have been created. The ACA didn\u2019t create all those jobs, but Republicans\u2019 hyperbolic alarm has been proven blatantly false.\n\nThe law\u2019s third goal\u2014to increase quality through innovation\u2014is showing extraordinary promise. Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs)\u2014groups of doctors, hospitals and other health-care providers, who come together to give coordinated care that emphasizes quality, not volume to their Medicare patients\u2014are growing across the country. More than 360 ACOs have been created since the law passed and are saving taxpayers and the Medicare trust fund millions of dollars.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO Magazine", "description": "Opinion: A law has never gotten so little recognition for doing so much good so quickly.", "title": "The Affordable Care Act Is Working", "url": "http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/03/affordable-care-act-is-working-104942.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/03/24/140324_obamacare_signup_gty_328.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Obamacare,Health Care,Opinion,Affordable Care Act,In The Arena", "twitter": {"site": "@politicomag", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politicomag"}, "description": "Opinion: A law has never gotten so little recognition for doing so much good so quickly.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2244\"", "article_summary": "In The Arena The Affordable Care Act Is WorkingIt is now four years since the Affordable Care Act was enacted.\nThe Congressional Budget Office found the health care law is making significant contributions to fiscal responsibility.\nThere\u2019s more good news when it comes to health care and Medicare spending.\nHealth insurance has expanded.\nAccountable Care Organizations (ACOs)\u2014groups of doctors, hospitals and other health-care providers, who come together to give coordinated care that emphasizes quality, not volume to their Medicare patients\u2014are growing across the country."}
