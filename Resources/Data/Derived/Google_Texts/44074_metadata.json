Asked to respond, House Speaker-Elect John Diehl first turns and draws reporters\u2019 eyes to his 117 fellow House Republicans.\n\n\u201cTake a look at the elections,\u201d says Diehl. \u201cI think clearly on the federal level Obamacare has been rejected by the voters of this country and I think if you take a look at the elections that happened [Tuesday], I think it\u2019s also been rejected by the voters of this state.\u201d\n\nVideo: Speaker-Elect John Diehl is critical of the timing of Democrats\u2019 support for Medicaid expansion\n\nDemocrats have only 45 members in the state House, but the caucus\u2019 leader Jacob Hummel says they will also keep pushing for expansion.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely. It\u2019s the right thing to do. I think it\u2019s crucial,\u201d says Hummel. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about hundreds of thousands of people that don\u2019t have access to health insurance because they don\u2019t qualify to be on the exchange and it\u2019s really a shame. The state\u2019s losing a lot of money.\u201d\n\nDiehl says Republicans will look for ways to reform Medicaid and Hummel says that\u2019s something his party has always been willing to talk about.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that the Medicaid system that we have now to implement the low threshold of eligibility right now is broken,\u201d says Diehl. \u201cThat has to be fixed, it wastes money, it doesn\u2019t provide the medical services that are needed \u2026 and so yes, I think we\u2019re going to probably try to address that.\u201d\n\nHummel says he\u2019s always been willing to talk reform, but wants to see some action.\n\n\u201cLast year we weren\u2019t allowed to vote on it. It was brought up as kind of a circus show,\u201d says Hummel. \u201cI think it would have passed last year if we would have had a vote on it out of the House. Getting it out of the Senate is obviously another matter.\u201d\n\nVideo: Jacob Hummel says his party wants to see some movement on the Medicaid issue", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Missourinet", "description": "The future of the Medicaid expansion debate seems clear with the state legislature dominated by Republicans who oppose it, but Democrats say they\u2019ll keep pushing.
