Madison — Gov. Scott Walker said Wednesday he supports a bill to help cancer patients afford oral chemotherapy pills and would sign it if the measure is approved by the Assembly on Thursday.

The bill has broad bipartisan support in the Legislature and passed the Senate 30-2 Tuesday, but GOP leaders in both houses of the Legislature for a time had resisted bringing it to the floor.

Speaking to reporters in Madison and other stops around the state Wednesday, Walker called on the Assembly to pass the bill, saying lawmakers should approve the version adopted by the Senate or make only modest changes to it. Making significant changes could risk having the bill fail, he said.

"I think it makes sense," Walker said of the bill. "You look at the vote total to pass what the Senate had, if they're going to make any modifications my hope would be that if they did something like that it would be something that the Senate would be amenable to. I don't think anybody wants to go through this whole process and then have it stuck because one house passes one version and the other house doesn't agree with it."

The proposal would require health plans to provide the same coverage for expensive chemotherapy drugs taken as pills at home as they do for the expensive chemotherapy administered through IVs at hospitals or clinics. The Assembly is taking it up Thursday in a debate likely to stretch into early Friday on a packed agenda of bills to provide oversight of schools receiving taxpayer money, change election laws, overhaul the Milwaukee County Mental Health Complex and limit asbestos lawsuits.

Walker initially said last week that he had no position on the oral chemotherapy bill and was focused instead on economic proposals like his $541 million tax cut package that passed the Legislature Tuesday. Walker's Democratic opponent, Mary Burke, said on Friday she supports the chemotherapy bill.

Wednesday, Walker said that privately he and his aides had been talking to legislative leaders for the last week telling them they thought it "made sense to move forward" with the measure.

But in a statement, Fitzgerald said he didn't recall that.

"No discussions regarding" the bill "took place between Gov. Walker and I prior to passing the bill. The decision was made entirely within the (Senate GOP) caucus earlier this week," Fitzgerald said.

Late Wednesday, Walker spokeswoman Jocelyn Webster said that the governor's office had had "discussions with leadership of both houses," telling them the governor thought the bill made sense and would sign it.

Also Wednesday, a chief GOP backer of the measure in the Senate called on Assembly Republicans to pass the bill without making changes to it — warning that any amendments could undermine it.

"I hope the state Assembly joins Governor Walker in supporting the Cancer Treatment Fairness Act without needless amendments. Cancer patients shouldn't have to jump through hoops to get the lifesaving drugs they need to survive," said a statement from Sen. Alberta Darling (R-River Hills), a co-author of the bill.

Walker's and Darling's comments came as the known number of Republican supporters in the Assembly inched up to 24. Like many of her GOP colleagues, Rep. Jessie Rodriguez of Franklin has declined to say where she stands on the bill, but one of her aides told a constituent this week she backs the bill, according to a copy of an email she sent to the constituent.

In all, there are 60 Republicans in the Assembly. Six oppose the bill, seven are undecided and 23 haven't publicly stated their stance.

Walker said he didn't have a problem with legislators declining to say how they stood on the bill, saying it's common for lawmakers to listen to voters before deciding what to do.

"They're listening to people," the governor said. "It's not so much talking, it's listening."

Assembly Majority Leader Pat Strachota (R-West Bend), an author of the bill, said Wednesday the situation was too fluid to determine whether the measure would pass the Assembly without changes.

On Wednesday, Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon, a Democrat, signed an oral chemotherapy bill into law in his state. Missouri's Republican-controlled Legislature voted to cap patient out-of-pocket costs at $75 for a 30-day supply of oral chemotherapy pills if the company offers those drugs as well as intravenous treatments. The cap could increase annually but can't rise above the consumer price index.

Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester) has said Republicans also were considering amending the Wisconsin bill, which would then send it back to the Senate for another vote early next month.

A spokeswoman for Vos couldn't immediately comment when reached late in the evening.

The Assembly will likely wrap up its work for the year Thursday, and the Senate meets for the last time April 1.

Rep. John Nygren (R-Marinette), an opponent of the bill, has said Assembly Republicans were considering capping the amount that insurers could charge consumers for oral chemotherapy each month as Missouri and California have done. California limits out-of-pocket expenses for oral chemotherapy to $200 for a 30-day supply of pills.

Wisconsin Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald (R-Juneau) said his chamber would review any changes to the bill the Assembly might make, but added he thought it would be difficult for the Assembly to make changes to the bill.

"It's going to be difficult for the Assembly to come up with something that's going to garner support," Fitzgerald said.

Democrats are wary, saying they feared Assembly Republicans would make changes as a means of keeping the bill from passing before the session ends.

Sen. Jon Erpenbach (D-Middleton) dismissed talk among some Assembly Republicans that they could make the bill better by amending it. "That's legislative speak for killing the bill," he said.

Cancer survivors, their families and advocates have voiced strong support in recent days, suddenly moving it onto lawmakers' agendas. Supporters say the requirement hasn't been shown to have a significant effect on premium costs.

The measure has more than enough votes to pass the Assembly — at least 24 Assembly Republicans support the measure, as do all 39 Democrats, meaning the bill has at least 63 votes in the 99-member chamber.

Much as Senate leaders did, Vos has so far used procedural moves to stymie the bill opposed by the insurance industry from getting to the floor, such as moving the Assembly version of the bill to another committee to trigger a legislative rule making it harder to force a floor vote. Before the Senate vote, he said he did that to allow time for an "honest discussion" by his caucus, saying that Republicans still haven't discussed the proposal in depth privately.

Opponents have noted the Affordable Care Act caps out-of-pocket expenses at $6,350 for an individual this year. Nygren has said the bill isn't needed because the Obamacare provision prevents situations that have occurred in the past where some insured patients faced tens of thousands of dollars in bills for oral chemotherapy.

Others have pointed out state laws govern how private insurance plans are covered, but not the federally regulated plans that larger self-insured employers offer their workers.

In the Senate, Fitzgerald reversed course after bottling up the bill last week by setting up an unusual phantom hearing in the Senate Committee on Organization, which he chairs. The Senate leader relented on holding the vote — and voted for the bill himself — after Democrats and other leaders in Fitzgerald's own caucus demanded a vote on it.

School choice. In another key vote for the Assembly on Thursday, lawmakers will take up legislation to increase oversight of publicly funded schools, including private schools with students who receive vouchers from taxpayers.

The Assembly on Thursday will take up the bill to fold the private voucher schools into the same report card performance system that rates the state's public schools. The Senate passed that bill, which was toned down from an earlier version that called for penalties for failing schools, in February.

But Assembly Republicans are likely to replace that bill with a rewrite by Rep. Jim Steineke (R-Kaukauna). It would add a council of political appointees to revamp the existing state report cards, and determine penalties for failing schools. But the Steineke version calls for the Legislature to take another vote at a later date for any of the provisions to take effect.

If the Assembly passes Steineke's version, it might kill both bills because the Senate has demonstrated it does not have enough votes for the bill that includes penalties for failing schools.
