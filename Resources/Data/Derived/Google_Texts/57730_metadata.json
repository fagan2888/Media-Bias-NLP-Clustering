The list includes Ezra Klein, Jonathan Cohn, Jonathan Chait, Mike Konczal, myself some of the time, and others. Right now the wonk brigade has been weighing in on Bernie Sanders, and is in general not too impressed on either financial reform or health care.\n\nAnd the response of some \u2014 only some \u2014 Sanders supporters is disappointing, although I guess predictable given that somewhat similar things happened during the 2008 primary. There will, I guess, always be some people who, having made an emotional commitment to a candidate, can\u2019t accept the proposition that someone might share their values but honestly disagree with the candidate\u2019s approach.\n\nRight now I\u2019m getting the kind of correspondence I usually get from Rush Limbaugh listeners, although this time it\u2019s from the left \u2014 I\u2019m a crook, I\u2019m a Hillary crony, etc., etc.. OK, been there before \u2014 back in 2008 I was even the subject of tales about my son working for the Clintons, which was surprising because I don\u2019t have a son.\n\nBut I\u2019m used to this stuff. It\u2019s a bit more shocking to see Mike Konczal \u2014 one of our most powerful advocates of financial reform, heroic critic of austerity, and a huge resource for progressives \u2014 attacked as one of Hillary\u2019s minions and an ally of the financial industry.\n\nWhat\u2019s really funny is that neither Mike nor I, nor, I think, any of the other wonks-turned-evil-minions have changed positions. Most of us argued long before there was a Sanders candidacy that the focus on Glass-Steagall and too-big-to-fail was misguided. In fact, I argued that position very early in the Obama years, at the same time I was arguing for temporary nationalization of a couple of big banks. I argued for an Obamacare-like strategy on health care, with perhaps a very gradual transition to single-payer via the public option, in my book The Conscience of a Liberal; and most of the progressive health care experts I can think of adopted pretty much the same position. So nobody should be surprised that a candidate who appears to be disregarding the analysis that led to these positions is coming in for some criticism.\n\nAnyway, I\u2019m not going to obsess over this \u2014 this too shall pass, just like the 2008 primary season when I was history\u2019s greatest monster because I was skeptical about the Obama promise of transformation.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20160123090100, "BN": "krugman", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/krugman", "DISPLAYDATE": "January 23, 2016", "keywords": "Uncategorized", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/krugman/Wonks and Minions ( 20160123 )", "PT": "Blogs", "SCG": "krugman", "sourceApp": "blogs", "twitter": {"description": "News flash: progressive can honestly disagree with your candidate\u2019s positions.", "title": "Wonks and Minions", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/01/23/wonks-and-minions/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "site": "@NytimesKrugman", "card": "summary"}, "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/krugman/post", "description": "News flash: progressive can honestly disagree with your candidate\u2019s positions.", "CG": "Opinion", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "January 23, 2016", "article": {"published_time": 1453557660, "author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/paulkrugman/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Uncategorized", "modified_time": "2016-01-23T14:01:00-05:00"}, "utime": 20160123140100, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20160123, "pdate": 20160123, "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "Paul Krugman Blog", "description": "News flash: progressive can honestly disagree with your candidate\u2019s positions.", "title": "Wonks and Minions", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/01/23/wonks-and-minions/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/01/23/wonks-and-minions/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "Wonks and Minions", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "article_summary": "Right now the wonk brigade has been weighing in on Bernie Sanders, and is in general not too impressed on either financial reform or health care.\nWhat\u2019s really funny is that neither Mike nor I, nor, I think, any of the other wonks-turned-evil-minions have changed positions.\nThe list includes Ezra Klein, Jonathan Cohn, Jonathan Chait, Mike Konczal, myself some of the time, and others.\nMost of us argued long before there was a Sanders candidacy that the focus on Glass-Steagall and too-big-to-fail was misguided.\nAnd the response of some \u2014 only some \u2014 Sanders supporters is disappointing, although I guess predictable given that somewhat similar things happened during the 2008 primary."}
