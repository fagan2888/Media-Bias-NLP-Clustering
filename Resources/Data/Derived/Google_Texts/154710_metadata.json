The lawmakers argued in their letter that when FEMA established the new flood maps for Massachusetts, it used \u201ca potentially inaccurate methodology\u201d that failed to appropriately reflect the geographic region and the unique flooding characteristics found in New England.\n\nThe methodology employed by FEMA ended up \u201cunnecessarily adding more families to the flood maps\u201d in the state, the Massachusetts Congressional delegation argued.\n\nThe letter, addressed to FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate, was sent on Dec. 13. In their letter, the lawmakers requested a delay in the implementation of Massachusetts\u2019 new flood maps until they are amended to appropriately reflect the geographic region.\n\nThe letter notes that Rep. Keating, a member of the U.S. House Homeland Security Committee, requested an independent review of the maps by a scientist and engineer affiliated with UMass Dartmouth\u2019s School of Marine Science and Technology, and Applied Coastal Research and Engineering. The review was conducted by Dr. Brian Howes and Mr. John Ramsey and specifically used the Town of Marshfield in Massachusetts as a test case.\n\nTheir findings, detailed in a white paper, indicated that FEMA applied an inappropriate methodology for the region when establishing the new flood zone maps, the Massachusetts Congressional delegation said.\n\nThe lawmakers said the FEMA methodology used the Pacific Coast model, which \u201cdoes not truly reflect flooding found on the Atlantic Coastline in New England.\u201d\n\nFlooding on the Pacific Coastline originates from the continuous nature of the waves. On the other hand, flooding on the Atlantic Coast is most often the result of storms and surges, the Massachusetts lawmakers said in their letter.\n\nMany Massachusetts residents and businesses are facing thousands of dollars in flood insurance premiums when the new maps are not even tailored to their region, Rep. Keating argued.\n\n\u201cWhile my colleagues and I have been addressing the issue of affordability for months, this is the first time we have scientific evidence that the entire state is being subjected to maps designed for the opposite coast,\u201d Rep. Keating said.\n\n\u201cThe only thing to do is delay implementation. FEMA needs to reevaluate our maps in light of this new information,\u201d Rep. Keating said.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren said families purchase flood insurance to prevent the loss of their homes, but now many families fear that the price of flood insurance could be just as devastating as any storm.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t protect someone\u2019s home by pricing them out of it, yet that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s taking place around the country,\u201d Sen. Warren said.\n\n\u201cWe need to give the government the time it needs to make sure that FEMA\u2019s new maps are accurate, reliable and reflect the best available scientific data, and we need to make sure that hardworking families who play by the rules can afford these policies,\u201d Sen. Warren said.\n\n\u201cIt is fundamental to community safety and insurance fairness to have accurate flood maps,\u201d Sen. Ed Markey added. \u201cFEMA should not finalize maps based on faulty science. These flood maps have huge economic repercussions for Massachusetts communities, so they must be accurate.\u201d\n\nRep. John Tierney commented that following the recent redrawing of flood maps, thousands of local homeowners and businesses have learned their flood insurance costs would be rising. \u201cWhile we were aware of clear shortfalls of the new maps, the recent review conducted by UMass Dartmouth has uncovered more evidence to call them into question,\u201d Rep. Tierney said.\n\n\u201cI join Rep. Keating and my other Massachusetts colleagues in continuing to push for a delay of these unreasonable premium rates until we can address the scientific and affordability concerns that have arisen from the new flood maps,\u201d said Rep. Tierney.\n\nRep. Stephen Lynch said he has attended community meetings and rallies in his district where affected homeowners have asserted that FEMA\u2019s flood maps are inaccurate and draw far too many people into flood zones.\n\n\u201cNow, we have scientific proof that these homeowners are right. I join my colleagues in calling on FEMA to halt their flood mapping process until Massachusetts homeowners can trust that FEMA\u2019s flood maps are accurate,\u201d Rep. Lynch said. \u201cThere is too much at stake to allow these inaccurate maps to go forward.\u201d\n\nRep. Niki Tsongas said, \u201cAs a member of the Natural Resources Committee, and with several major rivers and waterways crisscrossing the Third District (in northeastern and central Massachusetts), I have long been an advocate for not only preserving these natural resources but also supporting those who live and work around them. I have heard from concerned residents in the region and I urge action to help maintain affordable flood insurance.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur Commonwealth has seen a dramatic jump in flood insurance premiums at a time when residents and businesses are already struggling to make ends meet,\u201d Rep. Joseph Kennedy said. \u201cIt is our hope FEMA will consider the information contained in this new report and work with us to ensure Massachusetts has flood maps that are both fair and accurate.\n\nBelow is the text of the delegation\u2019s letter:\n\nDecember 13, 2013\n\nThe Honorable W. Craig Fugate\n\nFederal Emergency Management Agency\n\n500 C Street, SW\n\nWashington, D.C. 20472\n\nDear Administrator Fugate:\n\nIn an effort to continue our advocacy on behalf of the many residents that have been living in our coastal communities for generations, we request your immediate assistance in addressing concerns over the Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2019s (FEMA) new flood maps for Massachusetts.\n\nThough the Biggert-Waters National Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012 (Biggert-Waters) aimed to improve the actuarial soundness of the National Flood Insurance Program and introduce important reforms, significant unintended consequences have arisen throughout implementation.\n\nHaving heard from numerous homeowners that have seen their premiums rise dramatically due to change in flood zone determination, we have grave concerns that absent reconsideration of FEMA\u2019s flood zone maps for Massachusetts, many homeowners and business owners are potentially facing unfair and unaffordable rate increases.\n\nIt has come to our attention that the new flood maps being enlisted to predict coastal flood levels for Massachusetts were implemented using a potentially inaccurate methodology for our region. Unfortunately, these new maps serve as a directive for much more expensive flood insurance rates for many residents and business owners. The attached supporting documents, from an independent review by scientists and engineers from the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth School for Marine Science and Technology and Applied Coastal Research and Engineering, Inc., indicate that the broad application of the methodology used by FEMA in determining the development of the 2013 flood maps appears to have been inappropriate for our geography.\n\nSpecifically, FEMA used a model called Direct Integration Method (DIM) to determine \u201cwave setup,\u201d a phenomenon where water levels along a coastline are elevated due to breaking waves pushing water against the shore. It is our understanding that this model was created to meet specific needs of the Pacific Coast, including very long wave periods, and where storm surge is not significant. On the East Coast, storm surges tend to govern storm damage and the shorter wave periods do not generate wave setup similar to the Pacific Coast. According to the independent review, the effect of using a simplified wave setup methodology, rather than more sophisticated (physics-based) tools to predict the level of flooding, yields overly conservative results, unnecessarily adding more families to the flood maps.\n\nUsing potentially incorrect technology or data, FEMA has encumbered residents and business owners with faulty insurance premiums that can reach as high as $18,000 to $50,000 in some parts of the Commonwealth. Given the significance of this economic impact on families and businesses it is imperative that FEMA work swiftly to address these concerns.\n\nIn light of the new evidence regarding the incorrect methodology, we ask that FEMA work closely with us to take a number of steps:\n\n1. We ask that you work with us on a remedy to amend the Commonwealth\u2019s flood maps utilizing the correct methodology for our geographic region.\n\n2. We ask that you put in place a complete suspension of the new flood maps until a decision is made to amend them.\n\n3. We also ask that you notify us in writing by (February 1, 2014) of FEMA\u2019s proposed plan, including a draft timeline, to rectify flood maps for the Commonwealth. We hope that your office will keep our staff regularly apprised of the agency\u2019s progress in this regard.\n\nSimply put, we must get the maps right. The economic livelihood of the people of Massachusetts depends on it. Thank you for your prompt attention to this important issue.\n\nSincerely,\n\nWilliam R. Keating, Member of Congress\n\nElizabeth Warren, United States Senator\n\nEdward J. Markey, United States Senator\n\nRichard E. Neal, Member of Congress\n\nJames P. McGovern, Member of Congress\n\nJohn F. Tierney, Member of Congress\n\nMichael E. Capuano, Member of Congress\n\nStephen F. Lynch, Member of Congress\n\nNiki Tsongas, Member of Congress\n\nJoseph P.
