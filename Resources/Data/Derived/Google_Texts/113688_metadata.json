The resolution would say that only people, not corporations, are endowed with constitutional rights and that money is not speech, so regulating political contributions and spending isn\u2019t limiting political speech.\n\nAnd the Outagamie County Board voted last week to place a referendum on the ballot about whether the state should accept all available federal Medicaid money to expand its BadgerCare health insurance program for low-income residents. The state had earlier rejected the money.\n\nAll of the referendums are advisory votes, which means they aren\u2019t binding. But they do still hold weight \u2014 and are worthwhile for voters to weigh in on.\n\nFirst, it\u2019s a reflection of public frustration. As a grass-roots effort to get the public\u2019s opinion and get lawmakers\u2019 attention, it\u2019s a noble objective.\n\nThat thousands of people \u2014 in the case of the petitions \u2014 joined together to try to get the questions on the ballot speaks to the power of democracy \u2014 however limited it might be in these cases.\n\nAnd, who knows? It just might work. A strong outcome one way or another is fodder for the public to use to question their elected officials if their stances don\u2019t represent their constituents. It might even sway their opinion.\n\nIt\u2019s easy for people to feel like they\u2019re being left out of the political process \u2014 that their views aren\u2019t being heard by their representatives. The fact that in some cities, voters could decide on three referendums \u2014 so far \u2014 gives all of us a way to make our voices ring out.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://post.cr/1m6wwrV", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Multiple questions on November ballot are wake-up calls for elected officials.", "og": {"site_name": "Post-Crescent Media", "description": "Multiple questions on November ballot are wake-up calls for elected officials.", "title": "Referendums are voice of the people", "url": "http://www.postcrescent.com/story/opinion/editorials/2014/07/13/referendums-voice-people/12549857/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/postcrescent.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Multiple questions on November ballot are wake-up calls for elected officials.", "creator": "@postcrescent", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/57f7f70f0ac2caae728fb8d9174c2db77d94dd27/c=0-0-3456-3456&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Appleton/2014/07/11/referendum.jpg", "title": "Referendums are voice of the people", "site": "@postcrescent", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=880652726", "fb": {"app_id": 117306038338949}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "referendums, minimum wage, Citizens United, Obamacare, Wisconsin"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2ec4\"", "article_summary": "The fact that in some cities, voters could decide on three referendums \u2014 so far \u2014 gives all of us a way to make our voices ring out.\nThe same three cities have already agreed to November referendums about a resolution in response to the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s Citizens United ruling.\nVote Yes or No (Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto)Referendums in Fox Cities elections aren\u2019t rare, but they aren\u2019t all that common, either.\nAll of the referendums are advisory votes, which means they aren\u2019t binding.\nThis fall, though, voters may be faced with a ballot that\u2019s full of them."}
