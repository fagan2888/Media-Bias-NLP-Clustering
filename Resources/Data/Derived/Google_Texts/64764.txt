(CNN MONEY) – Bernie Sanders likely wants to raise everyone’s taxes to pay for universal health care, but promises it will be worth it.

The Democratic presidential contender has long promoted a single payer health care system, which would eliminate the private insurance market in favor of a government-run program. He calls it ‘Medicare for All.’

Sanders’ plan for health insurance is now in the spotlight, with rival Hillary Clinton demanding that he reveal how he’d pay for it. Her campaign contends it would require raising taxes on the middle class by 9%.

Sanders has waffled on whether he’d unveil details before the Iowa caucuses next month, but said the plan would be similar to legislation he introduced in Congress in 2013. Under that proposal, the middle class would ultimately save money, he says.
