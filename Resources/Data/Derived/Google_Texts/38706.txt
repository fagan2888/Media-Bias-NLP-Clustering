A push to get Hispanic residents to sign up for the affordable health care in Orange County was unsuccessful on Tuesday.

A volunteer group that's part of Organizing for Action tried to sign people up met at a Sedano's grocery store, but they were asked to leave. WFTV's Jorge Estevez found out the group didn't have permission to be at the store.

The volunteers were sent to the Sedano's on Curry Ford Road to target the Hispanic community.

"I have no idea what that is about," one shopper said.

The number of nationwide sign ups in Hispanic communities are said to be low. The group was asked to leave the Sedano's and move to a parking lot about a block away.

A manager at Sedano's said the volunteers never contacted corporate offices to gain access. The first volunteer to arrive had no idea they didn't have permission.

"I don't know if it was a coordination thing or it was just meet up over there and we were going to stand out on the corner with signs," volunteer Larry Brown said.

Even though the volunteers were asked to leave, they said it won't stop them from trying to sign people up.

"There was nothing that was going to stop us," Rosalyn Clark with Organizing for Action.

The volunteers said they handed out 300 informational flyers on Tuesday. It's unclear if they signed anyone up for health care.
