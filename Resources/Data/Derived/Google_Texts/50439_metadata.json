The aggressive cancer requires multiple waves of differing treatments, given its ability to quickly metastasize and reform secondary tumors following surgical intervention. The immune system\u2019s inability to recognize these secondary tumors makes the disease so pernicious, says Daniel Palmer, the chair of medical oncology and study leader.\n\n\u201cThe vaccine will work to manipulate the body\u2019s immune system to recognise microscopic cancer cells, meaning a patient is able to fight any remaining cells before the cancer forms again in any other parts of the body,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Centre treats more than 28,000 pancreatic cancer patients every year, with the cancer responsible for 9,000 annual deaths throughout the country. Fewer than four percent of patients survive five or more years after receiving a diagnosis, and they come just as quickly as they leave. Every year, 9,000 British residents receive diagnosis for pancreatic cancer, the ninth most common there. Symptoms during advanced stages include sudden weight loss, jaundice, upper abdominal pain, and others that point to a multitude of other diseases and conditions \u2014 delaying some diagnoses.\n\nOnly one in five pancreatic cancer patients benefit from surgery, with the rest dependent on chemotherapy and radiotherapy in many cases. With this new treatment, the vaccine is delivered in conjunction mostly with chemotherapy. Fatigue and nausea may be common side effects of the vaccine.\n\nSixty-four-year-old Allan Hellier, diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in October, told The Daily Mail he was thrilled to have been recruited for the study. \u201c\u2018I see it as a bit of an insurance policy to be honest,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to give myself the best quality of life with my wife Angela and our children and grandchildren.\u201d\n\nMaggie Banks, chief executive officer of the UK\u2019s Pancreatic Cancer Research Fund, said she looked forward to the study\u2019s conclusion, calling immunotherapy \u201can exciting area of research in the field.\u201d\n\nThe \u201ccancer vaccine\u201d follows regulatory approval of a treatment for prostate cancer, as scientists examine whether immunotherapy may help to treat lung cancer, too.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "cancer vaccine, immonotherapy, immunotherapy vaccine, pancreatic cancer vaccine, lung cancer vaccine", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Although scientists have investigated cancer vaccines for the past several decades, progress is slow in developing such treatments for lung cancer among others.", "title": "Immunotherapy Vaccine Debuts Against Pancreatic Cancer", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/immunotherapy-vaccine-debuts-against-pancreatic-cancer-implications-lung-cancer-270416", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/02/immunotherapy-vaccine-trials-against-pancreatic-cancer.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Although scientists have investigated cancer vaccines for the past several decades, progress is slow in developing such treatments for lung cancer among others.", "title": "Immunotherapy Vaccine Debuts Against Pancreatic Cancer", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/immunotherapy-vaccine-debuts-against-pancreatic-cancer-implications-lung-cancer-270416", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/02/immunotherapy-vaccine-trials-against-pancreatic-cancer.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/02/immunotherapy-vaccine-trials-against-pancreatic-cancer.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Conditions", "published_time": "2014-03-02T16:55:52-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-02T16:55:51-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Although scientists have investigated cancer vaccines for the past several decades, progress is slow in developing such treatments for lung cancer among others."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda8d1\"", "article_summary": "The Centre treats more than 28,000 pancreatic cancer patients every year, with the cancer responsible for 9,000 annual deaths throughout the country.\nA possible vaccine treatment for pancreatic cancer is undergoing clinical study in the United Kingdom.\nResearchers at the Clatterbridge Cancer Centre say the vaccine would be used following surgery for pancreatic cancer, along with other traditional treatments such as chemotherapy.\nEvery year, 9,000 British residents receive diagnosis for pancreatic cancer, the ninth most common there.\nOnly one in five pancreatic cancer patients benefit from surgery, with the rest dependent on chemotherapy and radiotherapy in many cases."}
