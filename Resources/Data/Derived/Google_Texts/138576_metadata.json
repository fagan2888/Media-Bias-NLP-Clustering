But maybe there\u2019s another way, for someone who has the courage to shift his rhetoric and present themselves as a bold truth-teller.\n\nTo put that in context, let\u2019s look at some new developments on the Obamacare front.\n\nA study just out from the Rand Corporation \u2014 not exactly a hotbed of socialist thinking \u2014 finds that after the coverage provisions in the Affordable Care Act took effect: \u201cwe estimate that 22.8 million people became newly insured and that 5.9 million lost coverage, for a net increase of 16.9 million with insurance as of February 2015.\u201d\n\nIn addition, a new Gallup poll shows that 43 percent of Americans say they\u2019re satisfied with the government\u2019s work in health care, which doesn\u2019t sound so great until you learn it\u2019s the highest number this question has received since the organization began asking it in 2001.\n\nWe already know that all the predictions Republicans made about the ACA \u2014 a decline in health coverage, skyrocketing medical spending and premiums, massive job losses \u2014 failed to come true. One seemingly sensible response to the facts about Obamacare is to pretend they aren\u2019t true, which is how prominent Republicans have handled things until now. After all, there hasn\u2019t been much punishment for spreading falsehoods about the law, and the public is still woefully uninformed about it. For example, for every American who knows that the law has proven much less expensive than was originally estimated, there are eight who mistakenly believe it ended up being more expensive.\n\nNevertheless, the good news continues to pile up, and at least some of it may be penetrating to the public, albeit slowly (approval of the law has been ticking up of late). Which could create the opening for a Republican willing to say something different from his peers.\n\nLet\u2019s imagine a presidential candidate who said something like this to GOP primary voters:\n\n\u201cI know that just saying \u2018Repeal Obamacare!\u2019 is a good applause line. And believe me, I wish it had never passed. But we\u2019ve had over 50 votes to repeal it in Congress, and it\u2019s still here. Like it or not, it\u2019s becoming entrenched. If we repealed it tomorrow, it would mean that millions of Americans would lose the coverage they\u2019ve got. We can\u2019t object to people losing their plans because of Obamacare, and then say it\u2019s no big deal if a much larger number of Americans lose their coverage when we repeal the law. And Obamacare does a few things that we Republicans favor. \u201cSo instead of just saying \u2018Repeal it now!\u2019, I\u2019m going to give you a plan to keep the good things, ditch the bad things, and move toward a better health care system. We\u2019ve spent the last five years banging our heads against the wall over this law, and some of my opponents think more banging is the answer. But I want to solve the problem.\u201d\n\nThe Republican who said that would, of course, be branded a traitor by some. But he\u2019d also get a wave of adoring press coverage, in which he\u2019d be characterized as a straight-talking man of courage and the only one willing to have an adult conversation about health care.\n\nThe outcome of the King v. Burwell lawsuit could also help make his case. If the Supreme Court rules in Republicans\u2019 favor, millions of Americans will lose their health coverage when subsidies are taken away, and efforts for a legislative fix are uncertain at best. The experience will make it clear even to many Republicans that \u201cBurn it down!\u201d isn\u2019t always the wisest approach.\n\nYes, a Republican who turned his back on \u201crepeal\u201d to focus on \u201creplace\u201d would be taking a huge risk, since GOP primary voters are not necessarily going to be thoughtful and measured in their response to someone proposing something less than all-out war against Barack Obama and everything he ever touched.
