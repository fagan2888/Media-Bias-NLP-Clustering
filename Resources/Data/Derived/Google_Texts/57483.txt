A little-noticed report released Friday afternoon by the Congressional Budget Office shows that the Senate bill to repeal most of ObamaCare would cut the deficit by as much as $474 billion, while boosting GDP, investment and capital stock.

The findings stand in sharp contrast to promises by President Obama and other Democrats that ObamaCare would accelerate economic growth and lower federal deficits.

According to the CBO, repealing ObamaCare’s subsidies and Medicaid expansion would cut federal spending by almost $1.4 trillion over the next 10 years. And getting rid of its myriad tax hikes would reduce tax revenues by $1.1 trillion, resulting in $281 billion decrease in projected deficits over the next decade.

However, the report says that repealing ObamaCare would “boost the economy’s output” by nearly 1% starting in 2021, because it would eliminate ObamaCare’s negative effects on the labor market and on saving and investment.

When these positive economic effects of ObamaCare’s repeal are included, the deficit reduction climbs to $474 billion, mainly because the faster economic growth would produce more revenues.

To be sure, the Senate bill is a partial repeal of ObamaCare that keeps in place the hundreds of billions of dollars in Medicare spending cuts included in the law. Republicans, as well as some outside experts, have complained that Obama has been double counting these savings anyway, using them both to “pay for” ObamaCare subsidies, and to claim they were extending Medicare’s solvency.

On the downside, CBO says 22 million people who would otherwise have gained coverage under ObamaCare won’t if it were repealed. It’s unclear whether CBO adjusted that number to account for the increase in jobs and economic growth that would result from ObamaCare’s repeal.

The Senate passed its bill as part of the budget “reconciliation” process, which means that it can’t be filibustered. The House passed a different version. Obama has promised to veto whatever version reaches his desk, and Republicans are unlikely to have enough votes to override the veto.
