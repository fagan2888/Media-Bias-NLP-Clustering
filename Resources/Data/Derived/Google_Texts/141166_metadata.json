I arranged everything with him. He was in agreement. What can a cardinal do but stand with the Pope? I am not the target, but the Pope.\u201d\n\n\u201cI find it amazing that the cardinal claims to speak for the Pope,\u201d responded Cardinal Raymond Burke, the prefect of the Vatican\u2019s Supreme Court, in a teleconference Wednesday with journalists.\n\n\u201cThe Pope does not have laryngitis,\u201d said Burke, the former Archbishop of St. Louis. \u201cHe can speak for himself.\u201d\n\nBurke, together with four other top Vatican officials, including Cardinal Gerhard Muller, the church\u2019s top doctrinal watchdog, has just published a book of essays against Kasper\u2019s proposal to allow divorced and remarried Catholics to receive communion.\n\nOne of Kasper\u2019s arguments is that receiving communion is a question of practice or discipline and not a doctrine of the church and is therefore open to change.\n\n\u201cIt is a very deceptive line of argument,\u201d Burke said. \u201cThere cannot be in the church a discipline that is not at the service of doctrine.\u201d\n\nAustralian Cardinal George Pell, a top adviser to Pope Francis, has also spoken out against Kasper\u2019s proposal.\n\n\u201cOne cannot maintain the indissolubility of marriage by allowing the remarried to receive communion,\u201d he writes in the preface to another newly published book in response to Kasper called \"The Gospel of the Family.\"\n\n\u201cDoctrinal and pastoral practice cannot be contradictory,\u201d Pell writes.\n\nTrue to form, Pope Francis\u2019 comments about communion for the divorced and remarried suggest affinity with both sides of the argument.\n\n\u201cI think this is the moment for mercy,\u201d he told journalists last year.\n\n\u201cThe divorced may have access to the sacraments. The problem regards those who are in a second marriage. \u2026 But, in parenthesis, the Orthodox (Christians) have a different practice. They follow the theology of what they call oikonomia and they give a second chance, they allow it.\"\n\nYet in May, Pope Francis dimmed expectations that the synod would deal decisively with the matter.\n\n\u201cWhat I didn\u2019t like, was what some people, within the church as well, said about the purpose of the synod: that it intends to allow remarried divorcees to take communion, as if the entire issue boiled down to a case,\u201d Francis said to journalists on the papal plane returning from the Holy Land.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t like us to fall into this question: Will it be possible for communion to be administered or not? The pastoral problem regarding the family is vast. Each case needs to be looked at separately.\u201d\n\nOn September 20, the Vatican announced that the Pope had appointed a special commission to reform and streamline the \u201cmatrimonial process.\u201d\n\nSome church watchers saw the move as an attempt to tamp down expectations that the synod would deal decisively with the communion issue.\n\n\u201cThe procedures for the annulment of marriage must be looked into,\u201d the Pope said in May. \u201cThe faith with which a person enters marriage must also be examined and we also need to make it clear that the divorced are not excommunicated. So often they are treated as though they have been excommunicated.\u201d\n\nBut Pell, the Australian cardinal, sought to diminish the high expectations of immediate change in church rules.\n\n\u201cThe sooner the wounded, the lukewarm, and the outsiders realize that substantial doctrinal and pastoral changes are impossible, the more the hostile disappointment (which must follow the reassertion of doctrine) will be anticipated and dissipated,\u201d he wrote in \"The Gospel of the Family.\"\n\nDuring the synod\u2019s first week, each day\u2019s meetings will open with a talk by a married couple discussing their experience of family life. Participants will then be given four minutes each to speak on a chosen topic, followed by a general debate.\n\nIn the second week, there will be small group sessions to discuss proposals in detail. The synod is not expected to make any final decisions, but only to produce a report of the discussions that will be taken up again at a second synod in October 2015.\n\nPope Francis is president of the synod, and the Vatican says he will be present and active in the discussions.\n\nOther voting participants (priests, bishops and cardinals, known as synod fathers) include 114 representatives of national bishops\u2019 conferences; 13 heads of Eastern Catholic Churches; 25 heads of Vatican Congregations and Councils.\n\nThere are 38 nonvoting participants, including 12 married couples. One of the couples represents a Catholic/Muslim mixed marriage. Two couples are from the United States.\n\nThere will be one vote at the end of the synod, to approve the final document of recommendations, called the Relatio Synodi, which will be given to Francis.", "article_metadata": {"description": "By Delia Gallagher, CNN Rome (CNN) -- More than 200 Catholic bishops, priests and laypeople from around the world gathered\u00a0in Rome this weekend to begin discussing Catholic teachings on a range of hot-button topics, from contraception and same-sex unions to polygamy and communion for divorced an...", "generator": "WordPress.com", "title": "Debate rages ahead of Vatican synod on the family", "og": {"url": "http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2014/10/03/debate-rages-ahead-of-popes-big-meeting/", "image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/140819144920-pope-francis-seoul-story-top.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "By Delia Gallagher, CNN\r\n\r\nRome (CNN) -- More than 200 Catholic bishops, priests and laypeople from around the world gathered\u00a0in Rome this weekend to begin discussing Catholic teachings on a range of hot-button topics, from contraception and same-sex unions to polygamy and communion for divorced an...", "title": "Debate rages ahead of Vatican synod on the family"}, "msvalidate.01": "DE341CAC7D45B696ED1776216C18054C", "fb": {"admins": 690014395, "app_id": 80401312489}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CNN Belief Blog", "keywords": "bishops, catholic church, christianity, culture wars, pope francis, same-sex marriage, sexuality, women, catholic church, pope francis, synod on the family", "google-site-verification": "mFBa4OnyEDU23vgVJ6rtX_4izud7FIi9JiscfVsWaKk", "original-source": "http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2014/10/03/debate-rages-ahead-of-popes-big-meeting/", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd971b\"", "article_summary": "Pope Francis is president of the synod, and the Vatican says he will be present and active in the discussions.\nIn the early church, for example, exceptions were made for remarried couples after a period of penance, Kasper has argued.\nYet in May, Pope Francis dimmed expectations that the synod would deal decisively with the matter.\nTrue to form, Pope Francis\u2019 comments about communion for the divorced and remarried suggest affinity with both sides of the argument.\nPope Francis called the meeting, known as a synod, to address modern issues facing families today - a topic that he has made a priority since the beginning of his pontificate."}
