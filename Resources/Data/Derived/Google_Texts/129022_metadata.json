Since I\u2019m a public finance economist, I\u2019m mostly concerned that the law increases the fiscal burden of government But I\u2019m also irked that Obamacare will worsen the third-party payer crisis , which it the main problem with our health care system in America.\n\nAnd it should go without saying that I\u2019m nauseated by the corruption that has been facilitated by the new regime.\n\nAll that being said, I\u2019m almost at the point where I feel sorry for Obamacare supporters. There\u2019s been a growing avalanche of bad news about government-run healthcare and they somehow have to justify this festering pile of you-know-what.\n\nFor instance, it must not be fun having to explain to people that their private financial and medical information will now be in the hands of some of the least competent people in America. Which means we\u2019re sure to see more stories like this.\n\nA MNsure employee accidentally sent an e-mail file to an Apple Valley insurance broker\u2019s office on Thursday that contained Social Security numbers, names, business addresses and other identifying information on more than 2,400 insurance agents. An official at MNsure, the state\u2019s new online health insurance exchange, acknowledged it had mishandled private data. A MNsure security manager called the broker, Jim Koester, and walked him and his assistant through a process of deleting the file from their computer hard drives. Koester said he willingly complied, but was unnerved. \u201cThe more I thought about it, the more troubled I was,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat if this had fallen into the wrong hands? It\u2019s scary. If this is happening now, how can clients of MNsure be confident their data is safe?\u201d\n\nOr imagine what it must be like when some of your biggest allies start complaining about the law. Such as union bosses.\n\nTop labor leaders left the White House on Friday after an hour-long meeting with President Barack Obama, still looking for a way to address concerns that \u201cObamacare\u201d will hurt their members\u2019 healthcare plans. The dispute with unions \u2013 traditional allies of Democrats \u2013 as the Obama administration begins to roll out Obama\u2019s signature healthcare reforms is providing political ammunition for Republicans who want to defund or repeal the law. \u2026Earlier this week, AFL-CIO members passed a resolution calling for significant changes to the healthcare law, stopping short of asking for its repeal, but exposing the rift between the labor movement and the Obama administration.\n\nOr government bureaucrats.\n\nA new survey of 2,500 federal employees and retirees found that 92.3 percent believe federal workers should keep their current health insurance and not be forced into ObamaCare. Only 2.9 percent say they should become part of the new health insurance exchanges.\n\nAnd what about stories about cost overruns.\n\nAccording to data published by the Department of Health and Human Services, the cost of the computer cloud that stores cost, coverage, and performance data for insurance plans sold under the Affordable Care Act (also called the ACA or Obamacare) has more than tripled since the contract was originally awarded in 2011. Press reports indicate that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) awarded a $10.8 million contract to Terremark \u2013 a subsidiary of Verizon \u2013 early in 2011. The contract called for the company to design a system to help consumers find an insurance plan and transfer it to CMS\u2019 computer cloud, among other duties. This week CMS announced the contract is now for $35.5 million \u2013 more than triple the original amount.\n\nAnd how about all the bad news about limited choice in the infamous Obamacare exchanges.\n\nOnly one company will participate in West Virginia\u2019s new individual health insurance marketplace. Media outlets report that Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield and Carelink/Coventry applied and were accepted to participate in the individual marketplace. But Carelink/Coventry has withdrawn. \u2026The health insurance marketplace is part of the Affordable Care Act. Enrollment begins Oct. 1. Coverage will begin Jan. 1, 2014.\n\nOr rising insurance costs.\n\nFor the vast majority of Americans, premium prices will be higher in the individual exchange than what they\u2019re currently paying for employer-sponsored benefits, according to a National Journal analysis of new coverage and cost data. Adding even more out-of-pocket expenses to consumers\u2019 monthly insurance bills is a swell in deductibles under the Affordable Care Act. Health law proponents have excused the rate hikes by saying the prices in the exchange won\u2019t apply to the millions receiving coverage from their employers. But that\u2019s only if employers continue to offer that coverage\u2013something that\u2019s looking increasingly uncertain. Already, UPS, for example, cited Obamacare as its reason for nixing spousal coverage.\n\nSo let\u2019s add all this up. Our privacy will be compromised, our choices will be limited, our costs will increase, and the government will squander more of our money. All for a law that even left-wing groups are learning to despise.\n\nThat\u2019s why I almost feel sorry for the President and his media flunkies.\n\nBut notice I said \u201calmost.\u201d In reality, I feel zero empathy for those who undermine our freedom with statism.\n\nIndeed, I want to add to their misery with some satire. So let\u2019s close this post with a few new Obamacare cartoons, starting with this gem from Steven Breen.\n\n\n\n\n\nGary Varvel adds his insight.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd here\u2019s a clever cartoon from Lisa Benson, though let\u2019s hope and pray something saves us from single-payer.\n\n\n\n\n\nLast but not least, Bob Gorrell shows the overall impact of this costly new entitlement on the economy.\n\n\n\n\n\nI have plenty of additional Obamacare cartoons here, here, and here, all of which help mock a bad law.\n\nBut let\u2019s remember a very serious point. As suggested by the Benson cartoon, the left sees Obamacare as a stepping stone to single-payer. And it you think Obamacare\u2019s a mess, I invite you to peruse the horror stories about the U.K. system linked at the bottom of this post.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Is It Time to Feel Sorry for the President and other Obamacare Supporters? - Daniel J.
