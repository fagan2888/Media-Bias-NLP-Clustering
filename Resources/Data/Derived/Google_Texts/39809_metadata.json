Thus, Wikipedia has grown into one of the most popular websites in the world.\n\nIf Vox were looking for a model to emulate, it could have done worse.\n\nSee also: Why This Is the Age of Publishers, Not Journalists\n\nFormer Washington Post star Ezra Klein's explanatory journalism website launched Sunday night and serves as the namesake for Vox Media, which also publishes The Verge, Eater and SB Nation. The site's content has quickly been likened to a newsier Wikipedia, with navigation that can be clicked through to gain an understanding about news and current events.\n\nI\u2019d say @voxdotcom cards are handy but not exactly revelatory. We already have Wikipedia, after all. And hyperlinks: http://t.co/wY5LdYkjEx \u2014 Andrew Sullivan (@sullydish) April 7, 2014\n\nSome people came to its defense, though.\n\nyeah i can't think of how detailed, updated backgrounders on complex news stories written by expert reporters would be at all useful \u2014 Matthew Zeitlin (@MattZeitlin) April 7, 2014\n\nThe site's welcome post, penned by Klein, fellow former Washington Post journalist Melissa Bell and former Slate writer Matt Yglesias, highlights that the site is meant to serve as a source for information, with an ultimate goal of providing context to the news.\n\nThe site's launch is \"the beginning of our effort to build the vast repository of information that will make it possible for us to explain the news in real time,\" according to the post.\n\nComparisons to Wikipedia's content might be a bit overly simplistic, but are flattering when it comes to SEO and web traffic.\n\nThe Wikimedia Foundation, which owns Wikipedia and several other sites, now attracts roughly 500 million visitors per month with billions of page views. Google's search alone generates 56% of that traffic, according to comScore.\n\nMedia websites are particularly beholden two areas of the Internet: social media and search. Wikipedia may have cornered the market on search, but BuzzFeed has found success corralling traffic from social media. BuzzFeed generates about 75% of its traffic through social referrals, according to Reuters. Vox sports the now-standard social media share buttons, but the evergreen nature of its content is more suited to long tail searches.\n\nVox would not be the first site to attempt to corner the market on search engine trends. An exhaustive article in SF Weekly detailed how Bleacher Report, a popular sports website, generated great traffic by determining people's search habits in order to optimize its content accordingly.\n\nSome companies have even tried to game the system. Rap Genius ended up in hot water with Google for some questionable linking practices.\n\nThose cards\n\nThe singular innovation of Vox, at least for now, is its cards.\n\nThey\u2019re inspired by the highlighters and index cards that some of us used in school to remember important information. You\u2019ll find them attached to articles, where they add crucial context; behind highlighted words, where they allow us to offer deeper explanations of key concepts; and in their stacks, where they combine into detailed \u2014 and continuously updated \u2014 guides to ongoing news stories.\n\nA recent New York Times article lauded Vox's intersection of journalism and technology as an important element of its efforts. Highlighters and index cards may not sound like the most technologically advanced idea, but permanent pages \u2014 the cards \u2014 that are routinely updated will provide an important foothold for the site.\n\nAs Bell told the Times, each card will be \"like a wiki page written by one person with a little attitude.\"\n\nObamacare and the missing Malaysian airliner are two of the topics covered by the site's inaugural series of cards. A quick Google Trends inquiry highlights just how popular these topics have become on its search engine.\n\nThe searches for Obamacare:\n\nThe searches for MH370:\n\nIt will take time to rise through the ranks of search engines, but the permanence of the cards is an important advantage.\n\nLinks are an important part of search engines. As Vox builds up its archives and link to its cards (and hopes that others do as well), those pages will rise up the search rankings.\n\nIt will be difficult to corner the market on an established topic like Obamacare, which has already generated thousands of articles. Newer stories may prove easier. If Vox's card on the Malaysian airliner had existed since the plane first went missing a month ago, it could have already been referenced many times and risen up the ranks.\n\nThe upside of turning up high on a search ranking for a key term like Obamacare is a flood of traffic. The downside is that SEO has become a very competitive field in which the winners take the bulk of the traffic. Those who can't make it to the first page of search results see rapidly diminished returns. The first result in a search engine gets 33% of the traffic, and the drop-off after that is steep.\n\nMoving targets\n\n\"We\u2019ll always be a work in progress,\" Vox concludes in its welcome post. For a site that seems reliant on traffic driven by people searching for a wide range of information, it will need to live up to that adage.\n\nSearch is not a stagnant element, and not even Wikipedia is immune to the ever-changing nature of the Internet. The site endured a traffic dip in 2013 as Google's Knowledge Graph started to infringe on its turf.\n\nFor Vox's search engine play to succeed, it will need to maintain a certain malleability. Google, not to mention other search engines, changes its search algorithm almost daily.\n\nThis leaves businesses that rely on Google in a precarious position, digital media entrepreneur Jason Calacanis noted at a recent tech conference: \u201cIf [Google is] taking the traffic away from Wikipedia, which is a non-profit, how do you think they\u2019re gonna treat everyone else?\u201d\n\nHave something to add to this story?
