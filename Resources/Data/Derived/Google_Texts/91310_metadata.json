Who knows where else Aetna has been funneling money?\u201d\n\nAetna denies the allegations.\n\nFiled on behalf of shareholder Stephen W. Silberstein, the CREW lawsuit says Aetna violated the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which prohibits companies from providing inaccurate information in proxy statements to procure votes for or against shareholder proposals.\n\nCREW says Aetna\u2019s proxy statements included inaccurate information and omitted information about the company\u2019s political activities to persuade shareholders to oppose proposals offered by the Service Employees International Union Master Trust (SEIU) in 2012 and by the Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations (UUAC) in 2013.\n\nThe shareholder proposals asked the company to fully disclose its political spending and sought increased board oversight of political activities. But Aetna told its shareholders that wasn\u2019t necessary because it had reached an agreement in 2007 with Mercy Investment Services to its political donations on its website or in a special report on its political contributions.X\n\nBut CREW says Aetna is hiding much of its political spending.\n\nAmong the donations that have not been disclosed, CREW said, is $3.3 million Aetna gave to the American Action Network, a conservative group fighting the Affordable Care Act, and $4.5 million to a Chamber of Commerce\u2019s political fund in 2012.\n\nUnlike other federal political donations, the contributions went to a political fund that reports its activities to the IRS, not the Federal Election Commission. The IRS filings do not require the reporting of individual donors. CREW found out about these contributions when Aetna inadvertently disclosed them in a filing with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.\n\nThe CREW lawsuit also says Aetna failed to report hundreds of thousands of dollars donated to the Democratic Governors Association and the Republican Governors Association since 2007.\n\nNamed in the suit are Aetna CEO Mark T. Bertolini and the company\u2019s board of directors. The lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.\n\n\u201cWe intend to vigorously defend against this lawsuit. Aetna meets or exceeds disclosure requirements of current laws and regulations,\u201d said Aetna spokeswoman Cynthia Michener.\n\nAetna declined to further discuss the charges in the lawsuit.\n\nThe lawsuit asks Aetna to void the votes in 2012 and 2013 against the shareholder proposals seeking greater transparency and to accurately report all of the company\u2019s political contributions since 2006.\n\nThe lawsuit is the first of its kind in that it seeks to use SEC laws to force disclosures of political contributions.\n\nThe SEC does not require companies to disclose their political spending.\n\nBut a coalition of campaign finance reform advocates have been pressing the SEC to require those disclosures, especially after the Supreme Court\u2019s Citizens United ruling allowed corporations greater involvement in federal political campaigns.\n\n\u201cThis is a big issue and kind of a pushback to Citizens United,\" said Common Cause spokeswoman Mary Boyle. \u201cShareholders have a right to know if a company is spending money on politics and what they are spending it on.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"original-source": "http://ctmirror.org/2013/12/10/aetna-sued-over-disclosure-political-contributions/", "og": {"site_name": "The CT Mirror", "description": "Washington -- A nonprofit watchdog group, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, filed a lawsuit Tuesday accusing Aetna of sending \u201cfalse and misleading\u201d proxy statements in 2012 and 2013 that hid millions of dollars of political donations. \u201cAetna pretends to be a model of corporate transparency, but in truth, shareholders have almost no idea [\u2026]", "title": "Aetna sued over disclosure of political contributions", "url": "http://ctmirror.org/2013/12/10/aetna-sued-over-disclosure-political-contributions/", "image": "http://ctmirror.org/files/2013/12/aetna-courtesy-photo_0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ctmirror", "card": "summary"}, "syndication-source": "http://ctmirror.org/2013/12/10/aetna-sued-over-disclosure-political-contributions/", "fb": {"admins": "10103384569292809,7920421,10205310995067193", "app_id": 439136839547306}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd09b3\"", "article_summary": "The shareholder proposals asked the company to fully disclose its political spending and sought increased board oversight of political activities.\nThe lawsuit is the first of its kind in that it seeks to use SEC laws to force disclosures of political contributions.\nUnlike other federal political donations, the contributions went to a political fund that reports its activities to the IRS, not the Federal Election Commission.\nThe SEC does not require companies to disclose their political spending.\nCREW found out about these contributions when Aetna inadvertently disclosed them in a filing with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners."}
