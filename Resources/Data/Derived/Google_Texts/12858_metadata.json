It raised $256 million in the year after its creation in November 2011, the document shows. And it made grants of $236 million \u2014 meaning a totally unknown group was the largest sugar daddy for conservative groups in the last election, second in total spending only to Karl Rove\u2019s American Crossroads and Crossroads GPS, which together spent about $300 million.\n\nShort, a soft-spoken but ferociously conservative 43-year-old operative, provided us a draft of a forthcoming IRS filing that will soon be available to the public. Short, like most in the Koch empire, feels wealthy conservative activists such as Charles and David Koch get a bum rap from the media. So, Short wants to ease his groups and their cause out of the shadows.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a mystery around us that makes an interesting story,\u201d Short said in an interview in his conference room. \u201cThere\u2019s also a vilification that happens that gets exaggerated when your opposition thinks you\u2019re secretive. Our members are proud to be part of [the organization].\u201d\n\n( Also on POLITICO: RGA haul far outpaces DGA haul)\n\nDemocrats have their own vast web of secretive funders \u2014 and Short is right: Few liberals got as much scrutiny as the Koch brothers over the past few years.\n\nBut the \u201cproud\u201d donors are not so proud they will publicly identify themselves as donors. Short refused to open up about the men and women behind the quarter-billion-dollar fund, beyond saying that Koch-linked entities provided a \u201cminority\u201d of the funds and that the largest single donor gave about $25 million.\n\nFreedom Partners is organized under the same section of the Tax Code as a trade association, a 501(c)6, which allows the group to conceal its donors from public release, although the amounts and recipients of its major grants are public.\n\nThe filing offers a rare tour of the conservative movement and how it gets its funds:\n\n\u2022 Center to Protect Patient Rights, a group that vehemently opposes Obamacare: a total of $115 million, from three grants.\n\n\u2022 Americans for Prosperity, an organizing and advocacy group that is courted by Republican presidential candidates: $32.3 million.\n\n\u2022 The 60 Plus Association, a free-market seniors group that also opposes Obamacare: $15.7 million.\n\n\u2022 American Future Fund, an Iowa group that spent a lot of money on ads in 2012, many for Mitt Romney: $13.6 million.\n\n\u2022 Concerned Women for America Legislative Action Committee, which gets involved in a number of social policy debates: $8.2 million.\n\n\u2022 Themis Trust, a Koch-based voter database that is made available to other conservative organizations: $5.8 million.\n\n\u2022 Public Notice, a fiscal policy think tank: $5.5 million.\n\n\u2022 Generation Opportunity, a group for \u201cliberty-loving\u201d young people: $5 million.\n\n\u2022 The LIBRE Initiative, which targets a free-market message to Hispanic immigrants: $3.1 million.\n\n\u2022 The National Rifle Association: $3.5 million.\n\n\u2022 The U.S. Chamber of Commerce: $2 million.\n\n\u2022 American Energy Alliance: $1.5 million.\n\n\u2022 And several groups \u2014 including the State Tea Party Express, the Tea Party Patriots and Heritage Action for America \u2014 got less than $1 million each.\n\nMembers are drawn from the Koch brothers\u2019 semiannual conferences, a 10-year-old tradition that draws top politicians \u2014 including, last month, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) and House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.). Many seminar attendees also give directly to Koch-approved groups, and the Freedom Partners funds do not include the Kochs\u2019 many gifts to university think tanks.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Cantor, Ryan headline Koch summit)\n\nShort says his members are \u201cconcerned that the nation that they grew up in and that their businesses have flourished in will not be there for their children and grandchildren,\u201d and are \u201ccommitted to trying to restore what they view are free markets in a free society in America.\u201d Many, he said, are \u201cHoratio Alger-type stories,\u201d most of them not household names, who got rich after starting small businesses, from service to manufacturing to information technology: \u201cThey are really worried about the country that\u2019s going to be left for their future generations.\u201d\n\nFreedom Partners now has 48 employees. The executive director is Richard Ribbentrop, a former head of the New York Stock Exchange\u2019s Washington office, who was chief of staff to former Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison and longtime legislative director to Sen. Phil Gramm, both Texas Republicans. At Hutchison\u2019s office, Ribbentrop hired Short, who succeeded him as chief of staff. Short later was chief of staff to then-Rep. Mike Pence (R-Ind.), who was chairman of the House Republican Conference, and is now governor of Indiana. The Freedom Partners vice president of strategic communications is James Davis, who was communications director of the 2012 Republican National Convention.\n\nThe group has five directors: Short; Wayne Gable, a longtime Koch Industries employee who was the new group\u2019s first director and holds a Ph.D. in economics from George Mason University; Richard Fink, a Ph.D. in economics who is president of the Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation; Kevin Gentry, a Koch official and vice chairman of the Republican Party of Virginia; and Nestor Weigand, a board member of Regal Entertainment Group and former president of the National Association of Realtors.\n\nWe asked Short what he has to show for all that money spent in 2012, when Republicans failed at a within-reach effort to take back the Senate and Romney left the GOP in a deep hole by getting wiped out among some demographic groups, including Hispanic and Asian voters. \u201cOur members are committed to the long term,\u201d Short said, \u201cnot to one individual cycle.\u201d\n\nKenneth P.
