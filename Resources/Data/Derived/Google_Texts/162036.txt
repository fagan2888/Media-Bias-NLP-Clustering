Talent on display at Elmhurst College Jazz Fest

hello

Collegiate musicians from across the Midwest helped bring a close to Elmhurst College's 47th annual Jazz Festival on Sunday at the school's Hammerschmidt Memorial Chapel.

About 2,000 jazz lovers attended the final performances of the prestigious, four-day festival which featured high school and college level jazz bands, as well as professional musicians, including a sold-out performance Friday by the Legendary Count Basie Orchestra.

Bands from suburban schools that performed this year included those from Downers Grove North High School, Elmhurst College, College of DuPage and Harper College.

In addition to performances from College of DuPage and Harper bands, Sunday's final session also included musicians from Murray State University, Western Illinois University, Central Michigan University, Harold Washington College and Purdue University.

It was Western Illinois' first time appearing at the festival.

"It's a great festival, and it has always been a really positive experience," said tenor sax player Michael Kennedy of Woodridge, who performed with the Western Illinois University Combo this year, but previously played with the Roosevelt University Jazz band. "I got to make music with my best friends."
