( Steve Stoner / Loveland Reporter-Herald )\n\nFORT COLLINS \u2014 Eight was enough for the pollsters.\n\nColorado State moved to 9-1 on the season with Saturday's 49-22 victory over Hawaii \u2014 the eighth straight for the Rams \u2014 voters from both major polls found a place for the team to fit.\n\nIn the AP Top 25, CSU slid in at No. 23, while in the USA Today Coaches Poll, the Rams took over the bottom spot at 25.\n\n\"As I've said all along, it's pretty cool that people are taking note of the good things happening at Colorado State University,\" CSU coach Jim McElwain said in a release. \"This is just another step in the climb, and I just can't tell you how proud I am of this team. We have a long way to go, but I'm happy for our fans, for this university and the people in the state of Colorado.\"\n\nHow times have changed.\n\nThe last time the football team was ranked was at the beginning of the 2003 season, and it lasted just that one week. In 2002, the Rams spent the final five weeks of the regular season in the polls before losing to TCU in the Liberty Bowl.\n\nIt was the end of a string, one where the Rams were ranked for at least one week from 1997-2003. While the winning may be new to the program, quarterback Garrett Grayson said it's not getting old.\n\n\"I think anytime you win a game you should celebrate,\" Grayson said after his four touchdown passes to set the single-season record with 26. \"Wins are hard to come by, no matter who you play. Every team is different. Coming off last week, with that close game, there were a lot of people saying (Hawaii) could be a trap game for us. I think anytime you win a football game, you should celebrate.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe last three years of the Steve Fairchild era led to 3-9 records, the end of which included recruitment of the current senior class. The Rams went 4-8 in McElwain's first season, then finished 8-6 last year with a win in the New Mexico Bowl.\n\nThey felt this year would be better, though receiver Charles Lovett said that talk takes place each and every fall. This time, the story that followed has been markedly different.\n\n\"This year, I feel like more guys believe. The guys that came here with me, the seniors, we're just tired, tired of being sick and tired, tried of losing,\" Lovett said. \"We've got a new coaching staff in here that believes in the players and put us in the right positions to make plays on the field. Take your hat off to the players and the guys who have been here through thick and thin and stayed. It's paying off, 9-1 now.\"\n\nColorado State has a bye this week, a chance to not only get some players healthy, but get a head start on preparing for the running attacks of New Mexico and Air Force the final two weeks of November.\n\nColorado State will head then head to a bowl game, but it is also hoping for a detour to the Mountain West championship game should Boise State falter in one of its final three games, two home dates with San Diego State and Utah State with a trip to Wyoming inbetween.\n\nShould that happen, then the possibility of an even more magical season starts to develop. But for now, Colorado State is enjoying the current ride it is on, and for McElwain, how it started.\n\n\"That's pretty cool. Sitting and reflecting on what these guys have committed to, really from that bowl game on,\" McElwain said after Saturday's win. \"When they went home for spring back and came back for Ram U, I think they've really turned into a football team. We're not the most talented outfit out there, but the guys are playing together, they're playing with energy. For the most part they do their job. I can't tell you how proud I am of them.\"\n\nMike Brohard: 970-635-3633, mbrohard@reporter-herald.com and twitter.com/mbrohard", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/sports/csu/ci_26902984/colorado-state-football-breaks-into-top-25", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2014/1109/20141109__10rhscsufbw~1_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By Mike Brohard \n \n  Sports Editor", "description": "FORT COLLINS \u2014 Eight was enough for the pollsters.\n\n\nColorado State moved to 9-1 on the season with Saturday's 49-22 victory over Hawaii \u2014 the eighth straight for the Rams \u2014 voters from both major polls found a place for the team to fit.", "ag": {"canon": "LovelandReporter-Herald:article:26902984:view"}, "startDate": "2014-11-09T14:11:42-0700", "og": {"url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/sports/csu/ci_26902984/colorado-state-football-breaks-into-top-25", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2014/1109/20141109__10rhscsufbw~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "FORT COLLINS \u2014 Eight was enough for the pollsters.\n\n\nColorado State moved to 9-1 on the season with Saturday's 49-22 victory over Hawaii \u2014 the eighth straight for the Rams \u2014 voters from both major polls found a place for the team to fit.", "title": "Colorado State football breaks into Top 25"}, "twitter": {"domain": "reporterherald.com", "description": "FORT COLLINS \u2014 Eight was enough for the pollsters.\n\n\nColorado State moved to 9-1 on the season with Saturday's 49-22 victory over Hawaii \u2014 the eighth straight for the Rams \u2014 voters from both major polls found a place for the team to fit.", "title": "Colorado State football breaks into Top 25", "url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/sports/csu/ci_26902984/colorado-state-football-breaks-into-top-25", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2014/1109/20141109__10rhscsufbw~1.jpg", "site": "@reporterherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-11-09T14:11:42-0700", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "sailthru.title": "Colorado State football breaks into Top 25", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2014/1109/20141109__10rhscsufbw~1.jpg", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "CSU", "google-site-verification": "XzsHDcJw4iXBQEYtDXFRaUAdKzxhSvxWMgXyQQNFFzg", "modificationDate": "2014-11-09T14:14:09-0700", "endDate": "2024-11-09T14:11:42-0700", "byline": "By Mike BrohardSports", "sailthru.site": "reporterherald.com", "pubDate": "2014-11-09T14:14:24-0700", "news_keywords": "Loveland Colorado ReporterHerald CSU Colorado State University Rams sports football basketball"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf2d6\"", "article_summary": "The guys that came here with me, the seniors, we're just tired, tired of being sick and tired, tried of losing,\" Lovett said.\n23 on AP list; 25 in Coaches PollA day after Colorado State's 49-22 victory over Hawaii, the Rams broke into the Top 25 of both polls, reaching No.\nBut for now, Colorado State is enjoying the current ride it is on, and for McElwain, how it started.\nWe have a long way to go, but I'm happy for our fans, for this university and the people in the state of Colorado.\"\n23, while in the USA Today Coaches Poll, the Rams took over the bottom spot at 25."}
