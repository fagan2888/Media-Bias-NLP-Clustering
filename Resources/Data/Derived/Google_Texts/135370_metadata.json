Two years ago, The Poynter Institute held similar workshops. As a former reporter who teaches journalism, I have attended these gatherings to find out how the news media expect to improve gun coverage. The answer is still a moving target.\n\nAt a time when the crime rate in America has plunged to record lows in most cities, the focus on gun violence may seem out of sync with current trends. On the contrary, say crime experts, the need to data-mine government records and to better inform the public about gun-buying laws and their loopholes has never been greater.\n\nAbove all, law enforcement officials and legal experts say, Americans are ill informed on this subject, thanks in large part to the news media.\n\nLawrence Rosenthal, a law professor at Chapman University in Los Angeles, blames journalists for failing to devote in-depth coverage of guns in high crime communities, and for ignoring the impact of right-to-carry laws in states like Florida.\n\n\u201cGuns are invisible in reporting,\u201d Rosenthal says.\n\nEven though shootings leading to injury and death occur with almost routine frequency every day in the U.S., the fact remains that it is mass shootings (often defined as a shooting with at least four victims in one location) that tend to provoke outrage nationwide, despite the fact that they kill or injure far fewer victims.\n\nFor example, the worst mass shooting in the U.S. occurred in 2007 at Virginia Tech when a shooter killed 32 students and teachers. That tragedy is dwarfed in terms of numbers by the annual number of shooting deaths nationwide. In 2010, there were 31,672 firearm deaths, including 11,078 homicides, 19,302 suicides, and 606 unintentional killings, according to the National Center for Health Statistics.\n\nThe average citizen tends to react with outrage to mass shootings in disproportionate intensity compared to the routine gun violence that occurs daily in communities across the country. Unless a family member or friend is a shooting victim in a convenient store robbery or drug deal, we usually pay attention to mass shootings with much greater concern than we do to those far more prevalent gun crimes involving victims of robbery or gang warfare.\n\nResearch indicates that media coverage of mass shootings plays an integral role in provoking public reactions of outrage. Indeed, reporting stories about gun violence follow a pattern that reflects predictable outcomes: Mass shootings receive relentless coverage to the point of sensationalizing the crime and, in the eyes of victims and families, making the shooter heroic. And yet routine shootings receive far less coverage in big cities where gun violence is as common as traffic jams.\n\nSuicides due to guns far outweigh all other shooting deaths by a nearly 2-1 margin, yet self-inflicted killings rarely make news, so the public remains oblivious to their magnitude on the spectrum of gun fatalities.\n\nDavid Kopel, a Denver lawyer and policy analyst for the Cato Institute, contends that the news media\u2019s weak coverage of gun violence reflects a polarized America. \u201cGun rights are not just the NRA,\u201d Kopel says. \u201cAnd gun control is not just the Brady Campaign.\u201d\n\nEric Sandstrom (esandstr@mesastate.edu) teaches at Colorado Mesa University.\n\nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Guest Commentary: On gun violence, mass killings shouldn\u2019t be the focus", "title": "Guest Commentary: On gun violence, mass killings shouldn\u2019t be the focus", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/11/27/guest-commentary-on-gun-violence-mass-killings-shouldnt-be-the-focus/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151127__20151129_Z00_OP29V_SANDSTROMp1.jpg", "height": 440}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151127__20151129_Z00_OP29V_SANDSTROMp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-27T12:20:21+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-20T03:31:03+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Ironically, mass shootings grab headlines but cause a tiny fraction of gun-related deaths in this country.\nAs a former reporter who teaches journalism, I have attended these gatherings to find out how the news media expect to improve gun coverage.\nDavid Kopel, a Denver lawyer and policy analyst for the Cato Institute, contends that the news media\u2019s weak coverage of gun violence reflects a polarized America.\nThe average citizen tends to react with outrage to mass shootings in disproportionate intensity compared to the routine gun violence that occurs daily in communities across the country.\nFor example, the worst mass shooting in the U.S. occurred in 2007 at Virginia Tech when a shooter killed 32 students and teachers."}
