The irony of the attack is that it was one of the more bipartisan elements of the entire reform initiative.\n\nThe idea was simple: doctors would be reimbursed through the Affordable Care Act for helping guide seniors through their end-of-life care options. One of the idea\u2019s more notable champions was Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) who explained back in 2010 that having advance directives or a living will \u201cempowers you to be able to make decisions at a difficult time rather than having the government making them for you.\u201d\n\nThe right didn\u2019t care. A certain former half-term Alaska governor started throwing around the phrase \u201c death panels \u201d; some policymakers who knew better embraced the lie ; and the worthwhile idea was quietly scrapped , chalking up a victory for mindless propaganda over sensible policymaking. An Obama administration proposal for \u201cvoluntary advance care planning\u201d in 2010 was also pulled in the face of right-wing apoplexy.\n\nGiven this history, it\u2019s kind of amazing to see the debate come full circle\n\nJeb Bush, defending his efforts to keep alive Terri Schiavo, a brain-damaged woman, when he was governor of Florida, suggested on Friday that patients on Medicare should be required to sign advance directives dictating their care if they become incapacitated.\n\nCampaigning in New Hampshire over the weekend, the unannounced candidate was asked about his handling of the Schiavo matter. Bush said, looking back, \u201cI don\u2019t think I would change anything.\u201d Given his decisions during the controversy, that itself is a striking posture.\n\nBut Bush added, \u201cIn hindsight, the one thing that I would have loved to have seen was an advance directive where the family would have sorted this out\u2026. I think if we\u2019re going to mandate anything from government, it might be that if you\u2019re going to take Medicare, you also sign up for an advance directive where you talk about this before you\u2019re so disabled.\u201d\n\nJust so we\u2019re clear, my point is not to criticize Bush about his position. On the contrary, he\u2019s exactly right on the substance \u2013 when it comes to end-of-life directives, not the Schiavo matter \u2013 and I\u2019m happy to give the former governor credit for ignoring the right-wing garbage surrounding the policy.\n\nBut I am curious how we reached this point. Five years ago, conservatives collectively lost their minds about President Obama reimbursing physicians who take some time to talk to Medicare patients about their options. Five years later, there\u2019s nary a peep from right about a leading Republican presidential candidate endorsing a requirement in which the government forces Medicare patients to complete an advance directive?\n\nIf the political world has matured on this point since 2010, I\u2019m delighted. If we can finally have a sensible policy discussion about end-of-life care without unhinged gadflies trying to scare people into believing nonsense, it\u2019s long overdue.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "As the ostensible Republican frontrunner embraces advance directives, the \"death panels\" debate has finally come full circle.", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/bush-ignores-right-wing-myth-wades-death-panel-politics", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "As the ostensible Republican frontrunner embraces advance directives, the \"death panels\" debate has finally come full circle.", "title": "Bush ignores right-wing myth, wades into 'death panel' politics", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/bush-ignores-right-wing-myth-wades-death-panel-politics", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/rtr4sg3k_copy.jpg?itok=EgEKX01r", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/bush-ignores-right-wing-myth-wades-death-panel-politics", "image": {"width": 830, "identifier": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/rtr4sg3k_copy.jpg?itok=baIMepMB", "height": 553}, "title": "Bush ignores right-wing myth, wades into 'death panel' politics", "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "As the ostensible Republican frontrunner embraces advance directives, the \"death panels\" debate has finally come full circle."}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2015-04-20T13:01:31-04:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "nv": {"author": "steve-benen", "title": "Bush ignores right-wing myth, wades into 'death panel' politics", "tags": "election-2016,elections,health,health-care-reform,jeb-bush,republicans,rachel-maddow-show", "published": 1, "date": "04/20/2015 13:01:31 EDT", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/bush-ignores-right-wing-myth-wades-death-panel-politics"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/steve.benen"}, "abstract": "As the ostensible Republican frontrunner embraces advance directives, the \"death panels\" debate has finally come full circle.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Election 2016, Elections, Health Care Reform, Health, Republicans, Jeb Bush"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9c03\"", "article_summary": "An Obama administration proposal for \u201cvoluntary advance care planning\u201d in 2010 was also pulled in the face of right-wing apoplexy.\nThe idea was simple: doctors would be reimbursed through the Affordable Care Act for helping guide seniors through their end-of-life care options.\nIf we can finally have a sensible policy discussion about end-of-life care without unhinged gadflies trying to scare people into believing nonsense, it\u2019s long overdue.\nFive years ago, conservatives collectively lost their minds about President Obama reimbursing physicians who take some time to talk to Medicare patients about their options.\nAs awful as Republican rhetoric became during the debate over health care reform, the \u201cdeath panel\u201d talking point continues to stand out as a uniquely stupid allegation."}
