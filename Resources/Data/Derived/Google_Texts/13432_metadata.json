At this point, the state has rolled over on the issue and agreed that their own conduct must be enjoined.\u201d\n\nChisholm, a Democrat, two of his assistant DAs, a special prosecutor and a special investigator contracted by the GAB, were defendants in a federal civil rights lawsuit filed by conservative targets of a series of politically charged John Doe investigations spanning four years.\n\nThe probe has featured predawn, paramilitary-style raids on the homes of conservative targets and the issuance of scores of subpoenas in the prosecution\u2019s pursuit of campaign finance violations.\n\nThe DA\u2019s case against conservatives hinged on an unusual \u2013 as of Tuesday, indefensible \u2013 reading of state campaign law: Chisholm has tried to argue that any political speech (for example, a television ad supporting lower taxes) that might produce support for a specific candidate can be regulated if he can find evidence that the speakers coordinated with the candidate.\n\nThe use of intimidating tactics like SWAT team raids against political opponents amounts to legal terrorism, and doing so on the basis of a theory that is \u2013 once the goal of defeating the opponents has been lost \u2013 admitted to be indefensible ought to be a crime.
