A yellow-green cloud.\n\nHe barely had time to react. \u201cAll my trenches are choked,\u201d Lamour cried into the field telephone to headquarters. \u201cI am falling myself!\u201d\n\nThese were the last words heard from Lamour. World War I, and warfare itself, were never the same.\n\nChlorine gas \u2014 sent crawling in favorable winds over Flanders Fields from German positions \u2014 sowed terror and agony for the first time on April 22, 1915. The era of chemical weaponry had dawned. The weapon of mass slaughter came to symbolize the ruthlessness and, many say, futility of the 1914-1918 Great War.\n\n\u201cIt is a new element in warfare. It is indiscriminate,\u201d said Piet Chielens, curator at the In Flanders\u2019 Fields Museum in nearby Ypres. And what\u2019s more, he said, \u201cyou create psychological terror.\u201d\n\nFoaming at the mouth, crazed and blinded, the French soldiers fled in all directions \u2014 sucking for oxygen, finding poison instead. The chlorine seeped into body fluids and ate away at eyes, throat and lungs. Some 1,200 French soldiers were killed in the chaos of that first 5-minute gas attack and the fighting that followed. Lamour, like scores of comrades, was never found.\n\n\u201cYou drown in your own lungs,\u201d Chielens said.\n\nToday, cyclists crisscross these same fields and farmers plow around monuments honoring the first gas victims. On Tuesday, the 2013 Nobel Peace Prize-winning Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons will hold a commemorative meeting close to the fields. The organization today monitors reports that chlorine gas has repeatedly been used in Syria\u2019s civil war.\n\n___\n\n\u201cNOTHING TO REPORT\u201d\n\nA century ago Tuesday, German forces gathered their best and brightest at army headquarters in Tielt, some 30 miles (50 kilometers) behind the front line, for a momentous discussion.\n\nCommanders had already been waiting 10 days for favorable winds, huddled in a patrician mansion lined with maps and dotted with landscape models. Tension had steadily risen after the Schlieffen Plan to smash through Belgium and take Paris by storm bogged down in Flanders and northern France. Germany was bent on breaking the stalemate of trench warfare. All options were open.\n\nHolding back some German commanders was their sense of military honor. Some argued that deploying more troops would achieve a bigger breakthrough.\n\nFritz Haber, a chemical expert and future winner of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, preached for more gas for more shock and awe. Others wondered if gas could be trusted to work as advertised.\n\nExasperated, Chief of General Staff Erich von Falkenhayn decided: Tomorrow we use the gas, or not at all.\n\nAcross the line, Lamour\u2019s French forces were reporting from the trenches: \u201cRien a signaler\u201d \u2014 nothing to report. That might have been different had they been able to peer a bit further across no-man\u2019s land \u2014 at how German troops had dug in, under cover of night, more than 5,000 gas cylinders with tubes pointing their way.\n\nThe next morning, German trenches were filled with soldiers ready to pounce once the gas had cleared. The plan was to release the chlorine in the frosty morning hours, when it would cling best to the surface and give soldiers a full day to advance. But a windless morning came and went. The breeze picked up only in the afternoon. At 5 p.m. the gas cylinders were opened, with devastating effect.\n\nOnce the gas cleared, the soldiers jumped out and made more progress than they had in months. Men, horses, rats, even insects \u2014 all lay dead or choking before them.", "article_metadata": {"description": "First WWI gas attack produced new horrors, changed warfare", "title": "First WWI gas attack produced new horrors, changed warfare", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "First WWI gas attack produced new horrors, changed warfare", "title": "First WWI gas attack produced new horrors, changed warfare", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/04/18/first_wwi_gas_attack_produced_new_horrors_changed_warfare/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/belgium-wwi-first-gas-attack.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "First WWI gas attack produced new horrors, changed warfare", "title": "First WWI gas attack produced new horrors, changed warfare", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/belgium-wwi-first-gas-attack.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Raf Casert", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe28be\"", "article_summary": "Some 1,200 French soldiers were killed in the chaos of that first 5-minute gas attack and the fighting that followed.\nIt is indiscriminate,\u201d said Piet Chielens, curator at the In Flanders\u2019 Fields Museum in nearby Ypres.\nThe next morning, German trenches were filled with soldiers ready to pounce once the gas had cleared.\nChlorine gas \u2014 sent crawling in favorable winds over Flanders Fields from German positions \u2014 sowed terror and agony for the first time on April 22, 1915.\nAnd what\u2019s more, he said, \u201cyou create psychological terror.\u201dFoaming at the mouth, crazed and blinded, the French soldiers fled in all directions \u2014 sucking for oxygen, finding poison instead."}
