Actress Nicole Kidman was blindsided when a paparazzo on a bike ran directly into her as she walked into her New York hotel Thursday. The cyclist, who was identified as photographer Carl Wu, apologized profusely after the incident.

“I’m so sorry! I’m so sorry!” Wu screamed.

Kidman had just left the Calvin Klein fashion show where she was seated in the front row, just a few feet away from Vogue editor Anna Wintour. Wu was apparently trying to snap photos of Kidman as she exited her car and entered her hotel when he lost control of his bicycle and rode directly into the actress. Kidman let out a scream, fell to the ground, and lost one of her shoes in the incident. Forty-six-year-old Kidman was noticeably shaken and gripping her ankle as she got up. An ambulance did come to the hotel to check on her.

"She looked hurt, but there wasn't any blood," a witness said. "She put her shoes back on and ran into the [hotel]."

According to TMZ, Kidman is pressing charges against Wu for crashing into her. He received a ticket for illegally riding his bike on the sidewalk, but there’s no word on anything else yet.

"It was awful, but I got back up," Kidman told E! News. “I was shaken up and I’ll deal with it later… Luckily, I got up. But there will be a time when someone does not. “
