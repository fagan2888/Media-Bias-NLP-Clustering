Use of the steroids have been linked to deaths.

The House passed the bill in September, meaning it now heads to President Obama’s desk to be signed into law.

The Senate also passed S. 2338, the United States Anti-Doping Agency Reauthorization Act, which authorizes appropriations for the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency through 2020. The agency ensures U.S. athletes don’t use performance-enhancing drugs. The measure now heads to the House for further action.
