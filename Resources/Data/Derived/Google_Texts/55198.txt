Jerad and Amanda Miller, the man and woman who allegedly killed three people as well as themselves in Las Vegas on Sunday, bragged to neighbors about being part of renegade rancher Cliven Bundy’s gun-toting group, reports the Las Vegas Sun.

According to the Sun, former neighbors of the couple said the two would frequently talk about their extensive collection of guns as well as the time they spent with Bundy and his crew. In reference to the couple, Sue Hill, a former neighbor, said, “Yap, yap, yap. They were always running their mouths.”

Other neighbors claimed that the couple was “radicalized” after spending time with Bundy:
