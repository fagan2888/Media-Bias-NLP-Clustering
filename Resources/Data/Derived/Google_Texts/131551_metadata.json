Chris Christie declared loudly at this week\u2019s Republican presidential debate in Las Vegas.\n\nVirtually the entire debate was based upon this premise. Which is understandable. Since the bloody Islamist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, Calif., terrorism has shot up as the chief concern for most Americans, particularly Republican voters.\n\n\u201cFor most of 2015, the country\u2019s mood, and thus the presidential election, was defined by anger and the unevenness of the economic recovery,\u201d pollster Fred Yang of Hart Research Associates explained upon the release of the latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll. \u201cNow that has abruptly changed to fear.\u201d\n\nOnly 34 percent approve of President Barack Obama\u2019s handling of the Islamic State, according to the poll, and more Americans are worried about terrorism than at any time since the aftermath of 9/11.\n\nThis abrupt change in the climate explains why Hillary Clinton is suddenly talking much tougher about terrorism and why the president is keen to get some good national security photo ops in before he leaves for vacation.\n\nBut I can\u2019t shake the sense that the polls, politicians and my fellow pundits are mistaking a symptom for the disease.\n\nWe live in an anxious age. That anxiety runs like a river beneath the political landscape. Different news events tap into that river and release a geyser of outrage and fear. Right now, mostly on the right, it\u2019s terrorism, but before that it was Mexicans illegally sneaking into our country. Sometime before that, there was the freak-out over Ebola and the administration\u2019s aloofness about it.\n\nPresident Obama holds year-end news conference President Barack Obama is holding his year-end news conference and taking questions from reporters at the White House before starting his annual Hawaii vacation.

(AP) See more videos\n\nOne common explanation for the anxious age we are in is that the economy is undergoing a profound transformation that is leaving a lot of people on the sidelines. It seems obvious to me there\u2019s a lot of merit to this explanation.\n\nBut I don\u2019t think that economics explains everything. Seventy percent of Americans think the country is on the wrong track. Many of those people are doing just fine economically.\n\nNo, I think the missing piece of the puzzle is the fact that Americans \u2014 on the left and the right \u2014 think that the folks running the country have an agenda different from theirs. The left has a much richer vocabulary for such claims, given its ancient obsessions with greed and economic determinism. These partisans see big corporations and the so-called \u201c1 percent\u201d pulling strings behind the scenes. (Watch literally any Bernie Sanders speech on YouTube to learn more.) Paranoia about the influence of big money in politics has inspired the Democratic front-runner to make revising the First Amendment a top priority.\n\nBut while there are a great many people on the right who also complain about crony capitalism and special interests, such concerns don\u2019t get to the heart of the anxiety, at least not for conservatives.\n\nLet\u2019s go back to where we started. Christie says, \u201cWe have people across this country who are scared to death.\u201d No doubt that\u2019s true. But for a great many of them, I suspect, the fear is not so much a fear of the Islamic State but a fear that our own government, starting with the president, just doesn\u2019t take terrorism seriously. We now know he was very late in taking the Islamic State seriously.\n\nI suspect most conservatives think that if America marshaled the sufficient will to defeat the Islamic State, we\u2019d make short work of it. Obama has no interest in such an undertaking. He reserves his passion for attacking Republicans or pushing his other priorities, such as climate change, which persistently remains a very, very low priority for most Americans.\n\nBut the president himself is a symptom. The whole system seems to have lost its mind. That there\u2019s even a debate about whether security officials should be allowed to look at the social media posts of immigrants is a sign that our bureaucrats have such open minds their brains have fallen out. We should have seen this coming five years ago, when we learned that Obama told the new head of NASA to make one of his top priorities outreach to the Muslim world.\n\nTerrorism is a big concern, but this sense that the political system is unresponsive, unaccountable and operating on its own self-interested ideological agenda is bigger. It is the uber-complaint that explains everything from enduring outrage over the lies that greased Obamacare\u2019s passage to fury over illegal immigration, disgust over corruption at the IRS and the Department of Veterans Affairs, the immortality of the Ex-Im Bank and countless other outrages du jour.\n\nThe failure of credible politicians to address this anxiety created an opportunity for Donald Trump. At least he\u2019s willing to say Washington is stupid.\n\nTribune Content Agency\n\nJonah Goldberg is a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and a senior editor of National Review.\n\ngoldbergcolumn@gmail.com\n\nTwitter @JonahNRO", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "What's really eating America?", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Tribune Content Agency", "author": "Tribune Content Agency", "og": {"site_name": "chicagotribune.com", "description": "\u201cWe have people across this country who are scared to death,\u201d New Jersey Gov.
