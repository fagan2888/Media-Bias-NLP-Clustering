An Aurora police officer shot a suspect wanted in connection with a double stabbing Saturday night, police said. The suspect has died

Officer Crystal McCoy, an Aurora police spokeswoman, said the shooting happened at 7:42 p.m. in the 700 block of Kenton Street when police responded to a report of a double stabbing.

Two people with stab wounds have been transported to a hospital. The suspect, who was shot, was also transported then later pronounced dead. One stabbing victim had life-threatening injuries as of 12:10 a.m. Sunday morning, according to a release by Aurora police. Both victims are adult females.

The police officer involved in the shooting was not injured, McCoy said.

Police were working two sections of Kenton Street as crime scenes. One house was roped off with crime scene tape, and a portion of the street several houses down also was surrounded by tape.

One neighbor, who asked not to be named, said he came outside after he saw flashing blue lights and saw police bust through the front door of a house across the street.

He thought he heard five to 10 shots, but a neighbor who lived on the end of the block where the shooting happened said she heard two shots.

This story is developing and will be updated as more information becomes available.
