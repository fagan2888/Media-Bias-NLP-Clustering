(NASDAQ:HMSY) today announced financial results for the first quarter of 2016. Net income for the quarter ended March 31, 2016 was $4.6 million or $0.05 per diluted share, compared to net income of $8.7 million or $0.10 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2015 and $3.5 million or $0.04 per diluted share in the prior year first quarter. Adjusted EPS was $0.14 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2016, which included $0.01 per diluted share of non-recurring legal expense, compared to $0.19 in the fourth quarter of 2015 and $0.11 in the prior year first quarter. Total revenue in the first quarter of 2016 was $119.8 million, compared to $128.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 and $110.3 million in the prior year first quarter.\n\n\u201cThe first quarter was a very solid beginning for 2016, particularly for our commercial health plan business which showed year-over-year revenue growth of nearly 30%. First quarter commercial health plan revenue of $56 million supports our earlier view that nearly half of the projected full-year 18\u201320% growth will come from the run rate impact of new business implemented throughout 2015,\u201d said Bill Lucia, Chairman and CEO. \u201cWe completed about one-third more customer implementations this quarter than the preceding quarter, and have a plan to implement the needed level of already-sold business over the next three quarters to meet our full year commercial health plan revenue objective.\u201d\n\nTotal revenue in the first quarter of 2016 of $119.8 million was approximately 8.6% higher than the prior year first quarter, as a significant increase in commercial health plan revenue was partially offset by a net decline in state revenue.\n\nCommercial health plan revenue in the first quarter of 2016 was $56.0 million, a 29.4% increase compared to $43.2 million in the prior year first quarter and a $2.5 million decline, as projected, from the prior quarter. State government revenue was $50.7 million in the first quarter, compared to $59.8 million in the prior year first quarter, and reflected a decline of $3.8 million compared to the prior quarter as projected. State revenue in the prior year first quarter benefited from a spillover of coordination of benefits work caused by the substantial increase in Medicaid enrollment during 2014 due to implementation of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nNon-Medicare RAC Federal and other revenue was $4.8 million in the first quarter of 2016, a $0.3 million decrease compared to the prior year first quarter and a decrease of $1.0 million from the prior quarter. Medicare RAC revenue in the quarter was $8.3 million, compared to $2.3 million in the prior year first quarter and $9.7 million in the prior quarter.\n\nCoordination of benefits (COB) revenue, which continues to be our largest product line across both the state government and commercial health plan sectors, was $82.9 million in the first quarter of 2016 compared to $83.3 million in the prior year first quarter, and accounted for 69% of total revenue in the quarter, compared to 68% last quarter and 76% in the prior year first quarter.\n\nPayment integrity revenue (excluding Medicare RAC) was $28.5 million in the first quarter, a $3.8 million or 15.5% increase from the first quarter of last year and a $3.2 million or 10% decline from the prior quarter. The year-over-year increase reflects both the higher level of payment integrity product sales to commercial health plan customers in recent quarters and an accelerated pace of implementations due to our \u201cink to green\u201d initiatives. The sequential decline is primarily the result of special year end projects completed in the prior quarter.\n\n\u201cTotal revenue of $119.8 million in the first quarter, an 8.6% year-over-year increase, was somewhat higher than our expectation due primarily to a few one-time projects in our commercial health plan business completed during the quarter and the finalization of more Medicare RAC audits than anticipated,\u201d said Jeff Sherman, Chief Financial Officer. \u201cThough we added significant resources during the quarter to boost customer implementations, total operating expenses declined from the fourth quarter level. We continue to expect operating costs for the full year to be flat with the prior year, excluding non-recurring legal expense, despite planned investments in our commercial health plan growth engine and product innovation initiatives,\u201d added Sherman.\n\nSee the Q1 2016 Investor Presentation for additional information about the Company\u2019s first quarter 2016 financial results which is available on the Company\u2019s website at http://investor.hms.com/events.cfm.\n\nWebcast and Conference Call Information\n\nHMS will report its first quarter 2016 financial and operating results at 7:30 AM CT / 8:30 AM ET on Friday, May 6, 2016.

These non-GAAP financial measures are used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP and reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the Company's operations that, when viewed with GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, provides a more complete understanding of the results of operations and trends affecting the Company's business.
