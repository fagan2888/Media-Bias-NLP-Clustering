The peppery asparagus could not have been cooked more flawlessly, and the tender little round potatoes were perfect sides to the meats.\n\nThe sausages had just enough spiciness for interest but not so much to mask the flavor of the cheese and meat.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Tulsa World", "description": "This is a recap of Scott Cherry's restaurant review in last week's Weekend section.", "title": "Second Helping: Barbecue restaurant's spicy dishes get to the meat and potatoes", "url": "http://www.tulsaworld.com/scene/restaurantguide/second-helping-barbecue-restaurant-s-spicy-dishes-get-to-the/article_ee141787-4ec0-54d6-a076-2c52dc994575.html", "image": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/tulsaworld.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/1/f3/1f3c1755-eca3-56f0-b119-0d778ac5bd52/5312e64cc4c6d.preview-500.jpg?resize=500%2C341", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@tulsaworld", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"app_id": 288003941350366}, "keywords": "potatoes,com,meat,asparagus,burnco,dishes,items,restaurant,baby,bbq,restaurantguide,scene,scenelatest", "news_keywords": "potatoes,com,meat,asparagus,burnco,dishes,items,restaurant,baby,bbq,restaurantguide,scene,scenelatest", "description": "This is a recap of Scott Cherry's restaurant review in last week's Weekend section."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdeada\"", "article_summary": "Remember me on this computer Login Screen Name or Email Now I remember!\nThe peppery asparagus could not have been cooked more flawlessly, and the tender little round potatoes were perfect sides to the meats.\nThe sausages had just enough spiciness for interest but not so much to mask the flavor of the cheese and meat.\nJust as good were the asparagus and potatoes.\nIf you feel you are currently subscribed please click on the button to attempt to find your account."}
