We learned recently, for instance, about a company that trademarked \u201cJesus.\u201d But what about the word \u201cObamacare?\u201d\n\nA Florida insurance agency is trying to register \u201cObamacare Enrollment Team.\u201d And an HR outsourcing firm based in Texas wants to trademark \u201cObamacare calculator,\u201d according to trademark records.\n\nThe companies recently heard back from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, which turned down both applications for the same reason: the word is too closely associated with a living person, namely President Barack Obama.\n\nFederal law bars the registering of a mark that \u201cconsists of or comprises a name, portrait, or signature identifying a particular living individual except by his written consent.\u201d*\n\nThe trademark office in letters to the companies last month said the public would \u201creadily associate\u201d the word Obamacare with Mr. Obama. The agency explained:\n\nPresident Barack Obama became President of the United States of America on January 20, 2009. For this reason, he is the subject of frequent media attention and his name is often in the public view. The proposed mark would be construed by the public as a reference to Mr. Obama.\n\nThe trademark office helpfully attached the Wikipedia entry for Barack Obama as supporting evidence. So unless the companies get the president\u2019s written consent, they\u2019re out of luck.\n\nMarc Reiner, an intellectual-property lawyer at Moss & Kalish Pllc in New York, said he quibbled with the government\u2019s reasoning. The term Obamacare \u2014 how people commonly refer to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act \u2014 is really identifying a law, rather than a person, he said.\n\nStill he doesn\u2019t see how anybody could have an exclusive trademark on \u201cObamacare enrollment team\u201d or \u201cObamacare calculator\u201d because both terms merely describe a service.\n\n* The restriction doesn\u2019t apply to dead people unless they used to be president of the United States.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "It's not always obvious which words you can trademark and which ones are off limits.
