In 1985, Microsoft Windows was released. Since then, Microsoft has released more than 20 updates to the operating system.\n\nUpdating the tax system is one of the perennial policy issues politicians enjoy talking about, and has the potential to be a key policy debate in 2015 and 2016.\n\nBut whether all the talk, hand-wringing and head-nodding will actually result in change is yet to be seen.\n\nWhile Washington has consensus that tax reform needs to happen, there\u2019s significant disagreement on how to reform it.\n\nA recent study on American attitudes and support for tax reform conducted by the American Perceptions Initiative, a project of The Heritage Foundation, found that only a slight majority of Americans support tax reform (52 percent), in part, due to limited familiarity with what \u201ctax reform\u201d actually means.\n\nHowever, once respondents gained more familiarity with the current tax system and the possibility of alternate approaches, the level of support for tax reform among Americans jumped significantly to 71 percent.
