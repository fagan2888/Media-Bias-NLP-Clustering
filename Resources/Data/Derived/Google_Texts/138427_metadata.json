When the deputy approached the area, the four men fled, according to Pasco Sheriff\u2019s Office spokesman Kevin Doll.\n\nThe teen, who suffered injuries to his face, mouth, neck, chest and back, was treated at Medical Center Bayonet Point in Hudson. He identified the attackers while at the hospital, Doll said.\n\nThe motive for the attack stems from a previous incident in which Keenan got in trouble for possible drug use, Doll said.
