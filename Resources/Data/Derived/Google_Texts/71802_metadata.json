The Obama administration has done its part fulfill that promise, maybe the only promise this president will ever keep.\n\nThursday night, prominent conservative Dinesh D\u2019Souza \u2014 author of The Roots of Obama\u2019s Rage and producer of the documentary 2016: Obama\u2019s America \u2014 was arrested on felony charges of violating campaign finance law. Obama\u2019s Department of Justice seeking a $1 million fine and seven years in prison. This hard approach to \u201cjustice\u201d stands in stark contrast to the way Obama\u2019s DOJ handled a prominent Democratic donor who got off with a misdeameanor, a nominal fine, and two months in jail for doing the exact same thing.\n\nWhat did D\u2019Souza do? He is charged with making \u201cstraw donations\u201d by asking friends to give a total of $20,000 to a 2012 U.S. Senate camapign in New York and then reimbursing them. If proven true, that is a violation of America\u2019s Byzantine campaign finance laws, and D\u2019Souza must face the consequences. But this case stinks to high heaven of selective prosecution of the president\u2019s \u201cenemies\u201d \u2014 a long-standing pattern of this administration, which Michael Barone aptly dubbed America\u2019s first \u201cgangster government.\u201d\n\nD\u2019Souza was trying to help out an old college friend, Wendy Long, who ran on the Republican ticket against incumbent Democrat Kirsten Gillibrand. Let\u2019s be clear: Long\u2019s campaign was nothing more than a ceremonial campaign so that someone represented the party on the ballot. She had no shot of taking out Gillibrand, who won with 72 percent of the vote to Long\u2019s 27 percent. Furthermore, Gillibrand spent $14.2 million on her campaign to Long\u2019s measly $742,000. Yet we\u2019re supposed to believe that the feds caught D\u2019Souza in their net after simply conducting \u201ca routine review by the FBI of campaign filings with the FEC by various candidates after the 2012 election for United States Senator in New York.\u201d And Gillibrand\u2019s campaign \u2014 which collected and spent 1,800 percent more money \u2014 had zero sketchy contributions?\n\nWe are to believe that D\u2019Souza\u2019s status as one of the president\u2019s sharpest and most-prominent critics had absolutely nothing to do with DOJ taking a sledgehammer to kill a gnat that over-contributed to a nuisance candidate an amount that probably matches the tip money for Gillibrand\u2019s 2012 campaign luncheons? That is beyond absurd \u2014 especially in light of what the FBI and DOJ have found not worthy of any investigation, let alone indictment.\n\nIn 2012, the Obama re-election campaign\u2019s online donation form did not require that the billing address match the card, or that the security code on the back be entered, or even that the state match the ZIP code. This allowed at least one British citizen to illegally contribute to Obama\u2019s campaign, and likely many thousand more non-US citizens to do the same. (It is, again, an insult to our intelligence that the most tech-savvy campaign ever didn\u2019t set up its donation page for that very purpose.)\n\nIn October 2012, the Federal Elections Commission announced that it identified more than $2 million in donations at Obama\u2019s campaign website in which no ZIP codes were entered or the ZIP codes were incomplete \u2014 an error that requires the donation to be voided, and a feature that was in place on Romney\u2019s campaign site. The FBI didn\u2019t even have to do any \u201croutine review\u201d of the Obama campaign to take action on lawbreaking on a much greater scale than that alleged of D\u2019Souza. Yet, it is merely a coincidence that no Obama campaign staffer or donor was investigated, let alone arrested?\n\nHere are more coincidences we\u2019re supposed to take at face value, and not as evidence of a corrupt Obama adminisration determined to \u201cpunish\u201d the president\u2019s \u201cenemies\u201d:\n\nKing Street Patriots founder Catherine Engelbrecht was investigated by the FBI, audited by the IRS, and also saw her spotless family business put under close scrutiny by the IRS, OSHA, and the ATF \u2014 all just months after she applied for nonprofit status for her \u201cTruth the Vote\u201d group to battle rampant election fraud. Among the information the IRS demanded was \u201cevery Facebook post and Tweet she had ever written,\u201d detailed information about her family, and whether she or any of her relatives had ever run (or thought about running) for political office. Liberal members of Congress also publicly accused her of being part of a \u201ccriminal conspiracy\u201d and demanded DOJ investigate.\n\nThe IRS systematically gave similar bureaucratic proctal exams to countless other Tea Party groups seeking nonprofit status \u2014 thus chilling the speech and political paticipation of right-leaning groups, but not those on the left.\n\nThe appointment by the Obama administration of a long-time campaign donor to \u201cinvestigate\u201d the IRS abuses, which resulted in an \u201cinvestigation\u201d that considered talking to the victims an afterthought\n\nAn IRS, unchastened by the public exposure of its corruption, deciding to \u201clegalize\u201d its practice of chilling of non-leftist speech with a new rule that will establish a policy of harassing Tea Party groups while leaving unions and leftist outfits alone. According to this post at Examiner.com , not a single public comment about the rule (as of January 21) was in favor. I doubt something as insignificant to the IRS as the public will has a chance of stopping its plans.\n\nThe Obama administration and its Democratic allies in Congress sacrificing cherished spending priorities in 2014 to ensure the IRS could still institute its rule to put \u201cTea Party groups out of business\u201d as the 2014 midterm elections approach.\n\nAn SWAT-team federal raid on Gibson Guitars \u2014 whose CEO is a Republican donor \u2014 for allegedly breaking the century-old and almost-never-enforced Lacey Act for using the same \u201cillegal\u201d wood its competitors use. (The executives of Gibson\u2019s competitors, not subject to similar raids for that \u201ccrime,\u201d happen to be big Democratic donors.)\n\nIntense IRS scrutiny of the only conservative organization in Hollywood, \u201cFriends of Abe,\u201d which included a demand for a complete donor list \u2014 something the IRS does not typically ask for in a \u201croutine\u201d audit. Leftist Hollywood nonprofits, such as Norman Lear\u2019s People for the American Way, have never cited cause to complain about similar IRS harassment.\n\nThe auditing of James O\u2019Keefe and his Project Veritas, which exposed the genuine abuse of nonprofit status by the leftist ACORN \u2014 a group Obama worked with closely before he ran for political office. Now, out of the blue, the New York State Department of Labor has demanded O\u2019Keefe appear before them with all his papers in order on Tuesday \u2014 including all \u201ccopies of Social Security returns, unemployment insurance (state and federal), check stubs and canceled checks, and any other records pertaining to payments for services.\u201d New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo wasn\u2019t kidding, it appears, when he said conservatives are not welcome in \u201chis\u201d state.\n\nBillionaire Frank VanderSloot, a decades-long big Republican donor, getting audited by the Obama\u2019s IRS for the first time in his life after giving generously to the \u201cSuper PAC\u201d of the Mitt Romney campaign. The Obama Labor Department was kind enough to follow up with an audit of all the workers on VanderSloot\u2019s Idaho cattle ranch. Billionaire leftist George Soros \u2014 the \u201cDaddy Warbucks\u201d for countless left-leaning groups, creator of his own leftist nonprofits, and big donor to Democratic campaigns \u2014 has never had reason to complain about such scrutiny.\n\nConservative journalist Wayne Allen Root being audited twice by Obama\u2019s IRS, and reporting that he personally knows of at least 15 people who were subject to IRS audits within 90 days of writing big checks to the Mitt Romney campaign. (Chilling detail: Root says the IRS agent who called him said he knew who he was, and knew that he served as a guest host for a conservative radio show.)\n\nAnd while we\u2019re talking about politicized \u201cjustice,\u201d I must mention the fact that Obama\u2019s DOJ has still refused to pursue criminal charges against global warming activist Peter Gleick. He publicly admitted to impersonating a director of The Heartland Institute via email, stealing Heartland\u2019s confidential and private property (its budget and planning documents), and distributing them to leftist allies for the purpose of harassing Heartland donors. He has not yet copped to creating his own version of a Heartland \u201cplanning document,\u201d an obvious fake, intended to defame the organization and distort the purpose of its work in climate science. A criminal trial that is not likely to happen \u2014 despite the open-and-shut case laid out to federal prosecutors by Heartland, as well as Gleick\u2019s public confession \u2014 would do a lot to clarify that point. [Full background here.]\n\nAre those examples enough to establish a pattern? To establish that these are not mere coincidences or \u201cbad luck\u201d on the part of conservatives and right-leaning groups? That there are countless more examples that are not publicly known?\n\nNever in the history of this country have we seen such a broad and coordinated abuse of the government\u2019s power to threaten criminal prosecution and ruin the lives and livelihoods of people the president and his party see as political \u201cenemies.\u201d None of the victims above did anything that even smelled like a criminal act act (except, perhaps, D\u2019Souza) before the state came crashing down with the inevitable and purposeful result of ruining their lives. Their only \u201coffense\u201d was publicly opposing the president\u2019s agenda, and putting those dissenters through the goverment\u2019s paces was the whole point.\n\nAs columnist Mark Steyn has often noted, the process is the punishment. Exercising your rights of free speech and free assembly will put you on \u201cthe list.\u201d So think twice before daring to oppose the statist agenda. Don\u2019t speak out. Obey \u2026 or else. The Obama administration\u2019s intimination tactics are encouraging the president\u2019s powerful allies in Congress to join in even more heartily. This week, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) delivered a despicable, un-American speech to the leftist nonprofit Center for American Progress. He urged the IRS to \u201credouble\u201d its intimidation tactics against the Tea Party, and anyone else who dares to \u201cattack government\u201d through peaceful political outreach and speech.\n\nThis should be the political scandal of the century \u2014 if only we had an honorable and competent MSM press corps in this country. Alas, it is more interested in Justin Bieber\u2019s arrest. If President Obama deigns to give the MSM an audience for questioning, we are treated to gems such as \u201cWhat is your New Year\u2019s Resolution?\u201d (Obama\u2019s answer: Be nicer to the White House Press Corps!)\n\nWhen George W. Bush was president, Hillary Clinton famously shouted:\n\nI\u2019m sick and tired of people who say that if you debate and disagree with this administration, somehow you\u2019re not patriotic. We need to stand up and say we\u2019re Americans, and we have the right to debate and disagree with any administration.\n\nBut apparently not this administration. Hillary Clinton was right. But she and those who cheered her are nowhere to be found now that the sideshow of Dixie Chicks protests have been replaced by the infinitely more threatening governmental suppression of principled public dissent. Today, left-leaning America \u2014 as well as the constitutionally protected MSM \u2014 have no interest in standing up for the patriotic right to \u201cdebate and disagree\u201d with the Chicago-style thuggery of the Obama administration. That is tragic for the cause of liberty, our politics, and our increasingly fragile republic.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://blog.heartland.org/2014/01/the-unceasing-political-thuggery-of-obamas-gangster-government/", "type": "activity", "image": "http://blog.heartland.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/obama-looks-angry.jpg", "site_name": "Somewhat Reasonable", "title": "The Unceasing Political Thuggery of Obama\u2019s Gangster Government"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcc00\"", "article_summary": "This allowed at least one British citizen to illegally contribute to Obama\u2019s campaign, and likely many thousand more non-US citizens to do the same.\nThe Obama administration has done its part fulfill that promise, maybe the only promise this president will ever keep.\nToday, left-leaning America \u2014 as well as the constitutionally protected MSM \u2014 have no interest in standing up for the patriotic right to \u201cdebate and disagree\u201d with the Chicago-style thuggery of the Obama administration.\nYet, it is merely a coincidence that no Obama campaign staffer or donor was investigated, let alone arrested?\nThe FBI didn\u2019t even have to do any \u201croutine review\u201d of the Obama campaign to take action on lawbreaking on a much greater scale than that alleged of D\u2019Souza."}
