Burwell case now pending. That ruling comes in June.\n\nBut for now, it\u2019s candles-on-the-cake time.\n\nThe President\u2019s bragging points are that pre-existing conditions are covered, people previously uninsured are able to get insurance, and premium rates can\u2019t be jacked up because the insured person is a woman. He hit those points this morning while taking his fifth year victory lap.\n\nHe is telling Obamacare opponents to \u201cembrace reality.\u201d\n\nHe is occasionally bending to requests from his allies to put off politically harmful aspects of the law.\n\nWhat the President likes to ignore about his health care law is that people who were perfectly satisfied with their previous health care coverage are worse off. They pay higher premiums, they have fewer choices of insurance carriers, they are much more limited in choice of doctors and hospitals than they expected.\n\nThe President is also hiding a secret like a rabbit in his hat: in 2018 when he has left office the most pernicious aspect of Obamacare kicks in. That is the so called Cadillac Tax, which is designed to force employers to cut back on employer provided insurance. The purpose is to convert the cash value of employer insurance into employee pay. The government will then benefit by being able to tax a worker\u2019s increased pay, in contrast to the employer provided health care benefit, which was exempt from taxation.\n\nGet it? It\u2019s a tax grab.\n\nIt\u2019s sneaky. And it will give the government a $250 billion increase in tax revenues. And in the process little by little employer provided health insurance will fade away.\n\nWe have talked about these downsides to Obamacare for a long time. All these unpleasant aspects are true, but the cheerleaders for Obamacare pooh-pooh them, and say \u201clook at this shiny object over here\u2013no pre-existing conditions, your kid can stay on your policy until age 26, etc, etc, etc\u2026.\u201d\n\nThe result is that Americans are doing what they always do when the government interferes with their lives: they complain, they mutter, they grumble, but they adjust and move on.\n\nWhich is what Obama has always counted on. A few people benefit big and their praise and hosannahs will be loud. Many people will be burdened with extra costs, longer drives, fewer choices but they will soldier on as they always do.\n\nThey may occasionally get sick, as happens. But everyday they will grow ever more sick of complaining.\n\nIt\u2019s already happening.\n\nThat\u2019s how Obama wins. Sooner or later most people will become accustomed to conditions they despise.\n\nSlow boiling the frog works exactly the same way.", "article_metadata": {"prism.channel": "fnc", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "og": {"site_name": "FOX News Radio", "description": "by John Gibson\r\n\r\nFollow on Twitter, Facebook and listen free/live on the foxnewsradio app\r\n\r\nPresident Obama is celebrating the fifth anniversary of Obamacare today.\r\n\r\nMore than half of the country is trying to forget it: disapproval is running ten points ahead of approval among the public living", "title": "OBAMACARE'S FIFTH BIRTHDAY: NOT ACCEPTED BUT SICK OF COMPLAINING", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://radio.foxnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Obamacare.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-03-25T11:58:16+00:00", "url": "http://radio.foxnews.com/2015/03/25/obamacares-fifth-birthday-not-accepted-but-sick-of-complaining/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://radio.foxnews.com/2015/03/25/obamacares-fifth-birthday-not-accepted-but-sick-of-complaining/", "image": "http://radio.foxnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Obamacare.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "OBAMACARE'S FIFTH BIRTHDAY: NOT ACCEPTED BUT SICK OF COMPLAINING"}, "prism.section": "radio", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=601935043", "fb": {"app_id": 108927045863499}, "article": {"section": "John Gibson", "published_time": "2015-03-25T11:58:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-25T11:58:16+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "by John Gibson\r\n\r\nFollow on Twitter, Facebook and listen free/live on the foxnewsradio app\r\n\r\nPresident Obama is celebrating the fifth anniversary of Obamacare today.\r\n\r\nMore than half of the country is trying to forget it: disapproval is running ten points ahead of approval among the public living"}, "article_summary": "And in the process little by little employer provided health insurance will fade away.\nThat is the so called Cadillac Tax, which is designed to force employers to cut back on employer provided insurance.\nThe purpose is to convert the cash value of employer insurance into employee pay.\nby John GibsonFollow on Twitter, Facebook and listen free/live on the foxnewsradio appPresident Obama is celebrating the fifth anniversary of Obamacare today.\nThe government will then benefit by being able to tax a worker\u2019s increased pay, in contrast to the employer provided health care benefit, which was exempt from taxation."}
