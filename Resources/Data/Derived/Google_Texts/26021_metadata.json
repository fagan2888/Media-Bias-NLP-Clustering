The initiative includes no penalties or risks for physicians, Burrell said, and it treats patient consults conducted online the same as office visits. In 2014 the average practice in the program received an additional $41,000 in revenue in addition to the participation fee, Burrell told the Board.\n\nAlthough the insurer's medical home model is strictly voluntarily, Burrell said 90 percent of the plan's 4,400 physicians around the District of Columbia, Maryland and Virginia are participating. The program, which began in 2011, covers 3.4 million individuals.\n\nChet Burrell, president and CEO of CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield, described how the model has both engaged physicians and reduced expensive procedures.\n\n\"No physician in his right mind ought to take insurance risk,\" he said.\n\nBurrell emphasized that the plan offers shared savings to primary care physicians, but not to hospitals or subspecialists. Using claims data, the insurer found that 75 percent of its patients have an established relationship with a primary care physician.\n\n\"We wanted to bring the incentives down to the individual primary care level,\" he said.\n\nCareFirst asks primary care physicians in the program to form into groups of five to 15 physicians called \"panels.\" Smaller groups do not produce enough data and larger ones make collaboration too difficult, Burrell said. Most panels have about nine physicians. Panels are graded using a combination of engagement, patient access and appropriate use of services. The engagement score, which carries the most weight, includes patient satisfaction and working within the medical home model.\n\nPhysicians in each panel hold monthly meetings to discuss the group's performance and compare notes. CareFirst will not drop a physician from a panel for low performance -- only in extreme cases where they refuse to cooperate with the plan -- but it will allow the panel members to address struggling practices. Given the competitive nature of physicians, Burrell said, panels motivate each practice to maintain high standards and correct any substandard performance.\n\nCareFirst created a \"patient care account\" that acts as a scorecard for each patient's activity and related costs, but it is not a substitute for an electronic health record system. To help physicians with referrals, hospitals and area specialists are assigned a grade based on their cost.\n\nBurrell said the insurer does contract with retail clinics for convenience services, but the clinics are bound by contract not to recruit patients away from their primary care physician.\n\nUpdate from America's Health Insurance Plans\n\nPhysicians are adopting new payment models gradually, Carmella Bocchino, executive vice president for America's Health Insurance Plans (AHIP), told the Board in a separate presentation. There is no \"magic bullet\" to replace fee-for-service, she said. She told the Board she explained to CMS officials earlier that physicians need to have at least 30 to 35 percent of their patients in some kind of shared risk model before they can make a transformation away from fee-for-service.\n\n\"You have to have ROI (return on investment) and sufficient revenue to move,\" she said.\n\nThe move toward common performance measurements, which the Academy is helping to lead, can help. The work is sorely needed. Bocchino said representatives from 30 different health plans at a recent meeting listed hundreds of different measures and found they shared just 10 in common.\n\n\"How can a physician take care of patients if you ask him to do all of this?\" she asked.\n\nBocchino said recent agreement on some core measurement sets from the Core Quality Measures Collaborative has brought the process to \"second base.\" Even so, there are still an estimated 700 core measures, which she said is far too many if the goal is to streamline the process.\n\n\"If we are measuring something that is not improving a clinician's practice, then what are we doing?\" she asked.\n\nAnother issue Bocchino raised was a lack of transparency regarding hospital insurance coverage that is causing frustration among patients. She recalled how one insurance industry executive visited the hospital with a spouse who needed a joint replacement. The couple asked an anesthesiologist if he accepted their insurance, and he had to leave the room to find out.\n\nWhen the anesthesiologist returned he told them, \"Our group takes your insurance, but I don't.\" So the couple asked him to send someone else.\n\n\n\n\"Consumers have to start asking these questions, but they don't know they have to ask them,\" Bocchino said.\n\nAnother looming issue is the 2.5 million individuals who are covered under transitional plans that do not meet standards outlined by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. They generally are paying annual premiums of $800 to $1,200, but they will need to choose new plans by 2017, and that could raise their premiums to $6,000, Bocchino said. These individuals typically are younger and choose minimal coverage.\n\n\"This is the next problem we will have,\" Bocchino said. \"But we have time to make the transition. They are healthy and are not sick, but they are distorting the risk pool.\"\n\nIf this group receives adequate premium subsidies through government action, their entry into the exchanges could help to lower premiums, according to Bocchino.\n\nRelated AAFP News Coverage\n\nIncentive Payments Lead to Healthier Patients, Say Michigan FPs\n\n(3/9/2015)\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "AAFP News", "description": "A model that offers financial incentives but wields no penalties has proved popular with physicians, an insurance executive told the AAFP Board of Directors.", "pubdate": "2016-03-04", "author": "Michael Laff", "og": {"image": "http://www.aafp.org/content/dam/AAFP/images/logos_internal/og/AAFP-capital-RGB2_1024x512B.png", "description": "A model that offers financial incentives but wields no penalties has proved popular with physicians, an insurance executive told the AAFP Board of Directors.", "title": "Model With Incentives, No Penalties, Proves Popular"}, "twitter": {"site": "@aafp", "image": "http://www.aafp.org/content/dam/AAFP/images/ann/2016-february/nc-Ramas_Burrell.jpg", "description": "A model that offers financial incentives but wields no penalties has proved popular with physicians, an insurance executive told the AAFP Board of Directors.", "card": "summary", "title": "Model With Incentives, No Penalties, Proves Popular"}, "lastreviewdate": "2016-03-04", "news-category": "Practice & Professional Issues", "nav-title": "Plan With Incentives, No Penalties, Proves Popular", "image": "http://www.aafp.org/content/dam/AAFP/images/ann/2016-february/nc-Ramas_Burrell.jpg.daijpg.90.jpg", "keywords": "insurance, AHIP, America's Health Insurance Plans, AAFP Board of Directors, PCMH, patient-centered medical home", "content-type": "news-article", "archive": "false", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "subcategory": "Practice & Professional Issues"}, "article_summary": "CareFirst asks primary care physicians in the program to form into groups of five to 15 physicians called \"panels.\"\nThe initiative includes no penalties or risks for physicians, Burrell said, and it treats patient consults conducted online the same as office visits.\nA patient-centered medical home model that offers financial incentives but wields no penalties has proved popular with physicians, an insurance executive told the AAFP Board of Directors here last week.\n\"We wanted to bring the incentives down to the individual primary care level,\" he said.\nIn 2014 the average practice in the program received an additional $41,000 in revenue in addition to the participation fee, Burrell told the Board."}
