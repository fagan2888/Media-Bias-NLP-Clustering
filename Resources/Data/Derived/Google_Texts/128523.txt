Noted socialist sourpuss Chris Hedges has a new show on teleSUR and it’s pretty awesome. In his most recent interview, Hedges discusses with Canadian intellectual John Ralston Saul the nature of “neoliberalism” as an organizing ideology and it’s pernicious effect on foreign policy.

“What is this ideology [of neoliberalism]?” Saul asked about the nature of our current economic and political order. “Let’s face it. It’s an ideology of inevitability, it’s an ideology based on self-interest. An ideology in which there is no real memory. And at the end of the day it’s about power and money.” Saul has been predicting the falls of “globalism” and the rise of nationalism for almost 20 years – a prediction that’s looking more and more realistic of late.
