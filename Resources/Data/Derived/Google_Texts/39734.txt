Michelle Obama would not be happy. The Labor Department was just forced to shut down its internal cafeteria due to unhealthy standards — specifically, the rodent feces that was found along the floor in one storage room.

City health inspectors closed the facility earlier this month for violating numerous sanitation codes, The Washington Post reported.

Among the violations: Employees didn’t wash their hands and the food bars were kept at the wrong temperatures, The Post reported.

But perhaps the worst violation: “Rodent feces were observed along floor perimeter in dry storage room, on glue trap in mop room and on a piece of unused equipment in the unused equipment storage room. Small flies were observed on surfaces (i.e. walls and ceiling) in kitchen rear and ware washing areas,” The Post reported, citing the inspection report.

Mrs. Obama, who spent the better part of her first lady years promoting her healthy eating initiative — and bringing federal menu standards to the nations’ schools — visited the agency in 2010 to read “Green Eggs and Ham” at the daycare center. Then, The Post noted, she talked up the “delicious and, hopefully, healthy snack for our children” that culinary students had prepared.
