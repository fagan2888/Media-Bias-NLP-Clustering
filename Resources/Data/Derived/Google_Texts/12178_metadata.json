What this means is that any person earning less than $11,500 a year will find themselves in a very unfortunate situation.\n\nFamilies who rely on unemployment benefits particularly are up for risk as well as retired individuals who may not have had the retirement plan they dreamed of.\n\nIn Florida alone about 764,000 adults will have to go without insurance because they couldn\u2019t quite meet the $11,500 requirement for health care or a tax credit.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had people break down in tears at our desk,\u201d said Jason Connor, who is under contract with community health care centers in Florida to assist with the Affordable Care Act outreach and enrollment activities. \u201cFolks are frustrated and they\u2019re angry, and they\u2019ll curse at you even though have nothing to do with it.\u201d\n\nWhile many people are pointing fingers at the president for yet another catastrophe in his health care plan, one Florida man believes the state governments need to be held accountable as well.\n\nMarc Alphonse is an unemployed 40-year-old Marine veteran who is essentially homeless and uninsured under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAlphonse is currently living off of $400 every month from unemployment benefits while his wife and three children are living with relatives.\n\nAlphonse, on the other hand, is hopping from couch to couch trying to get back on his feet. Not being able to get health care is just another major problem to add to his woes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very frustrating,\u201d Alphonse said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of odd where an individual that has an opportunity to help millions of people in their own state, and they just totally refuse to do it.\u201d\n\nOne-quarter of Florida\u2019s population younger than 65 are currently uninsured. A record high that comes in just behind Texas for the amount of uninsured citizens.\n\nFor now, many citizens are forced to focus on surviving instead of living the American dream.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s extremely scary, but I try not to think about it,\u201d Alphonse said. \u201cI just try to live every day because it\u2019s what you have to do to survive.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Atlanta Black Star", "description": "A gap in the Affordable Care Act has left almost 5 million Americans uninsured after a large number of Southern states decided not to expand Medicaid.
