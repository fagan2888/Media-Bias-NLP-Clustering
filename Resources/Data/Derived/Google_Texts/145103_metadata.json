It's going to be getting bad for the giant slalom.\n\n\"I don't know if this is the best way to show off our skiing. This is a disaster, it was a shame for everybody.\"\n\nBritain's Chemmy Alcott was in tears after slowing in the slush and missing a top-20 placing.\n\n\"I'm gutted,\" she said. \"In the last pitch I got on to the tropical snow and it beat me down here. I lost tons of time.\"\n\nNot all the skiers were bothered by the conditions though.\n\n\"The course was very easy,\" Italian Nadia Fanchini said. \"At the beginning the snow looked like soap a little bit but at the end it was more difficult.\"\n\nCourse workers have been working manfully to hold back nature and keep the race slopes compact despite the punishment they take from skis and the temperatures.\n\nUsing salt and injecting water into critical points has helped while start times have been changed with Sunday's men's super-G now getting under way at 10am.\n\n(Reporting by Martyn Herman.
