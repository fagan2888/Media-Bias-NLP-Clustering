How much more affordable would Planned Parenthood\u2019s services be were not its corporate bosses and affiliate CEOs making big bucks? For that 2012 reporting period, PPFA\u2019s 12-member executive team tallied a combined income of $3.87 million.\n\nWhen questioned by The Daily Caller in October 2012 about what was thought at the time to be an \u201calmost $400,000 salary,\u201d Richards responded, \u201cNone of my salary is paid for by the federal government.\u201d\n\nBut if \u201c[n]early half of Planned Parenthood patients rely on Medicaid coverage,\u201d as Planned Parenthood states, does Richards really think she\u2019d be making the same coin were government funding \u2013 to the tune of $540.6 million in FY 2012-13 \u2013 removed from Planned Parenthood\u2019s total revenue of $1.210 billion?\n\nAnd actually, The Daily Caller was well over $100,000 off on Richards\u2019 salary.\n\nTurns out Richards made $583,323 during Fiscal Year 2011 (July 1, 2011 to June 30, 2012). This represented a whopping 39% pay increase from the year before that, when she \u201conly\u201d made $420,153.\n\nSo, actually, Richards\u2019 2012 salary of $523,616 represented a 10% pay cut.\n\nBut this was because she took time off from Planned Parenthood to campaign for President Obama\u2019s reelection \u2013 which paid off for Planned Parenthood handsomely via windfall income via Obamacare and other government funding streams, only kept flowing by Obama and other pro-abortion politicians.\n\nThis sort of financial cushion then frees up Planned Parenthood to raise and spend money to elect pro-abortion candidates, who then return the favor.\n\nSee how the circle of loot works?\n\nAnd where are the liberals \u2013 the Occupy Wall Street types \u2013 who supposedly despise such top-heavy income? They oppose Big Oil, Big Pharma, and Big Finance. But Big Abortion? Not on your life, or rather, not on the lives of innocent little babies.\n\nReprinted with permission from", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "LifeSiteNews", "description": "{meta_description}", "title": "Planned Parenthood CEO\u2019s annual salary now exceeds $500,000", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://www.data.lifesitenews.com/images/blog/2-e1326142871362-200x249.jpg", "url": "https://www.lifesitenews.com/blogs/planned-parenthood-ceos-annual-salary-now-exceeds-500000", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "{meta_description}"}, "description": "{meta_description}", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "fb": {"admins": 1477213784, "app_id": 132010293551131, "pages": 112623813202}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf7c2\"", "article_summary": "\u201cPlanned Parenthood works to make health care accessible and affordable,\u201d boasts Planned Parenthood.\nHow much more affordable would Planned Parenthood\u2019s services be were not its corporate bosses and affiliate CEOs making big bucks?\nAnd actually, The Daily Caller was well over $100,000 off on Richards\u2019 salary.\nThis sort of financial cushion then frees up Planned Parenthood to raise and spend money to elect pro-abortion candidates, who then return the favor.\nBut this was because she took time off from Planned Parenthood to campaign for President Obama\u2019s reelection \u2013 which paid off for Planned Parenthood handsomely via windfall income via Obamacare and other government funding streams, only kept flowing by Obama and other pro-abortion politicians."}
