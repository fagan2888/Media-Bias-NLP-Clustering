I\u2019m so excited and happy with my results that I\u2019m partnering with Duchesnay USA to raise awareness about treating morning sickness,\u201d West wrote in her Instagram post. It was also linked from her Twitter account, which has 34 million followers.\n\nBut her Instagram post, which has since been taken down, \u201centirely omits all risk information,\u201d an official with the FDA\u2019s Office of Prescription Drug Program wrote in an four-page email that cites the entire 100-word Instagram post.\n\nTo correct the record, the FDA called for a \u201ccorrective piece\u201d that clears up West\u2019s previous claims. If the company does not respond, it could result in \"seizure or injunction\" of the treatment, according to the letter.\n\nAnd because the FDA requests the correction to be distributed \u201cusing the same media,\u201d it could result in another post by West herself.\n\nWest's post included a link to a company website with safety information but did not specifically list possible side effects.\n\nIn a statement, Duchesnay USA wrote that it \u201cacknowledges that its communications, including in social media as in this particular instance, need to be in accordance with applicable rules and regulations.\u201d\n\nA representative for the company told TMZ that it had \"a deal with Kim for only one post.\"", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.title": "FDA threatens to pull drug after Kim Kardashian endorsement", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T05:25-05:00", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "title": "FDA threatens to pull drug after Kim Kardashian endorsement", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/250868-fda-threatens-to-pull-drug-after-kim-kardashian-endorsement", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/kardashian-west-instagram-diclegis-copy-cropped.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "author": "Sarah Ferris", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/250868-fda-threatens-to-pull-drug-after-kim-kardashian-endorsement", "dcterms.date": "2015-08-11T16:41-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Sarah Ferris", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-11T16:41:44-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/250868-fda-threatens-to-pull-drug-after-kim-kardashian-endorsement", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "card": "summary", "title": "FDA threatens to pull drug after Kim Kardashian endorsement"}}, "article_summary": "A recent endorsement from Kim Kardashian West has a drug company in hot water with federal regulators.\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warned pharmaceutical company Duchesnay last week that it could face consequences over the celebrity\u2019s \"misleading\" Instagram post promoting its morning sickness drug.\nI\u2019m so excited and happy with my results that I\u2019m partnering with Duchesnay USA to raise awareness about treating morning sickness,\u201d West wrote in her Instagram post.\nAnd because the FDA requests the correction to be distributed \u201cusing the same media,\u201d it could result in another post by West herself.\nBut her Instagram post, which has since been taken down, \u201centirely omits all risk information,\u201d an official with the FDA\u2019s Office of Prescription Drug Program wrote in an four-page email that cites the entire 100-word Instagram post."}
