Its future, and insurance coverage for millions of people, might hang in the balance, for neither the first nor the last time.\n\nAdditional Images Opponents of Obamacare, such as Amy Brighton of Medina, Ohio, may be hoping that the Supreme Court deals the Affordable Care Act a crippling blow when it gets around to ruling on a challenge that comes before the justices on Wednesday.

Adler, a Case Western Reserve University School of Law professor who\u2019s a leading critic of the law.\n\nThe oral argument Wednesday morning in King v. Burwell marks the latest return of the Affordable Care Act to the Supreme Court since 2012. Then, in a 5-4 decision authored by Chief Justice John Roberts Jr., the court upheld the law\u2019s \u201cindividual mandate\u201d requiring people to buy health insurance or pay a penalty.\n\nThis time, too, Roberts might play an important swing role, as the self-appointed protector of the court\u2019s reputation.\n\nAnd, as in 2012, the case has drawn an unusual number of kibitzers. Twenty-one amicus \u2013 friend of the court \u2013 briefs, some more trenchant than others, were filed supporting the challengers, and 31 defending the Obama administration\u2019s actions.\n\nFOUR WEIGHTED WORDS\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s task this time is different from that in 2012 or in 2014, when a 5-4 majority ruled corporations could claim a religious exemption from a mandate to provide contraceptive coverage. Now, instead of determining whether Congress exceeded its constitutional authority in writing the health care law, the nine justices must interpret the statute\u2019s meaning.\n\nUnder the health care law, states are encouraged, but not required, to establish exchanges to offer one-stop shopping for insurance coverage. Obama has likened the exchanges to an online site such as Amazon, a place where consumers can compare plans.\n\nAs inducement, the law offers tax credits to those qualified by income who buy insurance through an exchange \u201cestablished by the State.\u201d The challenge turns on this phrase.\n\nDriven primarily by Republican resistance, several dozen states declined to establish health insurance exchanges. Nevertheless, the Internal Revenue Service has extended tax-credit subsidies to residents in these states who buy insurance through the federal exchange, HealthCare.gov.\n\n\u201cMore than 5 million of the people who obtained coverage through exchanges in 2014 lived in one of the 34 states with an exchange operated by the federal government,\u201d the legal team headed by U.S. Solicitor General Donald Verrilli Jr. said in a Jan. 21 brief, \u201cand the overwhelming majority of these people relied on tax credits to pay their premiums each month.\u201d\n\nThe remaining states \u2013 including California, Kentucky, Idaho and Washington \u2013 as well as the District of Columbia have established their own exchanges.\n\nThe tax-credit subsidies, moreover, are an essential part of the health care law\u2019s insurance requirements. Congress, Verrilli noted, \u201ccannot mandate people having something they can\u2019t afford.\u201d\n\nThe challengers to the law have essentially flipped this argument on its head. They say an unwanted and illegitimate subsidy moves them, against their will, under the Affordable Care Act\u2019s discipline.\n\n\u201cBy expanding subsidies,\u201d conservative attorney Michael Carvin, the lead counsel for the plaintiffs, argued in a brief, \u201cthe IRS rule triggers (Affordable Care Act) mandates and penalties for millions of individuals and thousands of employers in states served by HealthCare.gov.\u201d\n\nAs often happens in big Supreme Court cases, the named individuals in the underlying lawsuit were essentially enlisted for the task. Their job is to meet all legal requirements and to present a sympathetic face.\n\nDavid King, the first-named plaintiff in the health care case, is a Virginia resident and Vietnam veteran. Usually, his plaintiff\u2019s obligation would be done once the legal rocket has launched; King\u2019s name, for instance, appears only once in his side\u2019s 57-page lead brief.\n\nReports by The Wall Street Journal and other news organizations have raised questions, though, about whether King and the other plaintiffs have truly suffered injuries that create the legal standing necessary to file a lawsuit. King, for instance, is eligible for veterans\u2019 health care.\n\nEven if two or three of the named plaintiffs fall off the case, only one is needed for standing. If this is established, the court can reach the underlying argument.\n\nHere, challengers say the law\u2019s black-and-white text is crystal clear: A health exchange must be established by \u201cthe state\u201d for tax-credit subsidies to be available. The federal government, by this reasoning, cannot simply step in when states have declined to act.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s really crucial is what does the law itself say, because that\u2019s the law that binds all of us,\u201d said Carrie Severino, a former clerk to Justice Clarence Thomas who\u2019s now chief counsel of the conservative Judicial Crisis Network. \u201cWe have to be able to refer to some objective law out there.\u201d\n\nThomas and Justice Antonin Scalia pay strict attention to text.\n\nDISPUTED DEFINITIONS\n\nSupporters of the law counter that the questionable phrase cannot be understood in isolation. Instead, citing everything from the expectations of states to the deal-making that shaped the legislation, they insist on a broader interpretation.\n\n\u201cFocusing on isolated phrases divorced from textual cross-references, definitions and context, and with no regard for the statute\u2019s structure and design, does not respect the rule of law,\u201d Verrilli wrote.\n\nThe administration\u2019s argument appeals to justices such as Elena Kagan, Obama\u2019s former solicitor general. In an unrelated recent case involving a Florida fisherman, Kagan all but foreshadowed the reasoning that the Affordable Care Act\u2019s supporters will adopt in defending the law.\n\n\u201cWe do not construe the meaning of statutory terms in a vacuum,\u201d Kagan wrote, adding that sometimes \u201cthe dictionary definition of a disputed term cannot control\u201d the outcome.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Four words in a 906-page law could affect whether millions can be covered under the Affordable Care Act.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "description": "Four words in a 906-page law could affect whether millions can be covered under the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Ambiguity has Obamacare in the balance - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 999, "identifier": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/597031_AP702980339834.jpg", "height": 758}, "updated_time": "2015-03-02T08:52:15-04:00", "url": "http://www.pressherald.com/2015/03/01/ambiguity-has-obamacare-in-the-balance/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Four words in a 906-page law could affect whether millions can be covered under the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Ambiguity has Obamacare in the balance - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "image": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/597031_AP702980339834.jpg", "creator": "@pressherald", "site": "@pressherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=951845858", "fb": {"admins": 769488179, "app_id": 178078215650057}, "google-site-verification": "QWs9pxQP8fwo2-nR5mWopc6qCK2D3920f7bl-U-zkso", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressherald", "section": "Health care", "published_time": "2015-03-01T04:00:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-02T08:52:15-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd002d\"", "article_summary": "David King, the first-named plaintiff in the health care case, is a Virginia resident and Vietnam veteran.\nNow, instead of determining whether Congress exceeded its constitutional authority in writing the health care law, the nine justices must interpret the statute\u2019s meaning.\nUnder the health care law, states are encouraged, but not required, to establish exchanges to offer one-stop shopping for insurance coverage.\nThey say an unwanted and illegitimate subsidy moves them, against their will, under the Affordable Care Act\u2019s discipline.\nThe oral argument Wednesday morning in King v.
