It is private people like me that are gladly funding the research, because we feel it is our honor to serve and our responsibility to CHOOSE to serve our fellow men. Talk with the doctors, or better yet, the patients I sat with in the therapy rooms. They will tell you all about public health and the VA. If private care like this were not available, many like me and much worse may be dead. Private charity and private clinics pave the way on experimental treatment. It is a rich blessing to us all that we live in a country where we can live side by side and so vehemently disagree and yet still be able to treat the other with respect. We all have different paths and beliefs, but you can take the public route and I will choose private. It is only when I would force you to take my route that one should cry foul. Of course, that works in the other direction as well. May God bless you and your team.\n\nBeck said veteran after veteran is committing suicide in government-run health care, and it is \u201cevil rich people\u201d like him who are supporting facilities like the Carrick Brain Centers, which have an \u201cunbelievable\u201d record of treating veterans.\n\n\u201cThis is the way it happens, Ed. When you have experimental stuff, the private market doesn\u2019t even want to do it,\u201d Beck said. \u201cThe private market says, \u2018Well, wait a minute. Hang on, no.\u2019 And the last one to give you this is the government.\u201d\n\nBeck read the comments on Schultz\u2019s Facebook page before his response \u2014 many of which were cheering on Beck\u2019s illness, or saying God or karma were punishing Beck for being so villainous \u2014 before reading the subsequent comments.\n\n\u201cBless you, Mr. Beck, and thank you for what you do for the fabric of our country,\u201d one commenter wrote. \u201cI may not always agree with you, but you\u2019re one on the only voices left I trust.\u201d\n\nAnother added: \u201cI\u2019m currently under the health care of the government while I battle PTSD and depression. It\u2019s no wonder the suicide rate among veterans is so high. The quality of care government provides you makes you feel like no one cares at all \u2026 Reading the comments of the section of Ed\u2019s post is concrete evidence that you are on the right path, Glenn. Love is what the world needs right now.\u201d\n\nBeck noted how the comments \u201cwent from total hate\u201d to love and understanding.\n\n\u201cLove is the answer,\u201d Beck said. \u201cJust speak the truth, do so with compassion, and know that you\u2019re not going to change people\u2019s minds. I\u2019m not going to change Ed Shultz\u2019s mind. I\u2019m not going to try to change his mind. I am just going to speak peace. I\u2019m going to speak the truth.\u201d\n\nBeck said \u201cgood, reasonable people on both the left and the right\u201d read these posts, and they run from combative, argumentative partisans.\n\n\u201cGo in as a peace-maker, speak your peace, speak it with kindness, love and empathy for everyone involved, then just retract,\u201d Beck suggested. \u201cMore of us [doing] that will be able to soften hearts. And we start by softening our own.\u201d\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nThe full episode of The Glenn Beck Program, along with many other live-streaming shows and thousands of hours of on-demand content, is available on just about any digital device.
