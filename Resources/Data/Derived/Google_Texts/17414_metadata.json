Rick Scott accelerated his efforts Thursday to secure federal funding for hospitals\u2019 care for the poor, filing an injunction aimed at preventing the Obama administration from ending the program.\n\nScott met with Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell on Wednesday to ask for a prompt decision on extending the Low Income Pool, a Medicaid program set to expire June 30 that would bring $1.3 billion in federal dollars to health providers in the state. No agreement was reached, and federal officials are still reviewing Scott's proposal to extend LIP, filed in April.\n\nHe filed suit in U.S. District Court last week alleging that the federal government was tying it\u2019s decision on whether to extend LIP to Florida\u2019s decision to expand Medicaid. Such \u201ccoercion\u201d is unconstitutional, Scott argues.\n\nTime is of the essence for Scott, whose top priorities of tax cuts and increased education spending are tied up in a fight between the House and Senate over whether to expand Medicaid, so he filed an injunction to push the court to order the federal government to unbind its LIP decision from Florida\u2019s Medicaid expansion decision.\n\nLawmakers in both chambers say they need a definitive answer from the federal government on LIP before they know how much is available for tax cuts and other spending priorities, but they are constitutionally obligated to pass a balanced budget each year. The fiscal year ends June 30. The Legislature adjourned last week without a budget but will reconvene for a special session June 1.\n\n\u201cBy refusing to continue funding a multibillion-dollar Medicaid program that offsets the costs of uncompensated healthcare (sic) provided by safety-net hospitals and trauma centers, children\u2019s hospitals, medical schools, and other providers statewide unless and until Florida agrees to opt into the Affordable Care Act\u2019s Medicaid expansion program, the federal government has engaged in \u2018unconstitutional coercion,\u2019\u201d the filing states.\n\nRead the full injunction filing here.\n\nA \"readout\" of Scott's meeting with Burwell issued by HHS says she told the governor LIP funds \"are not dependent\" on Florida's Medicaid expansion decision. But the readout also states that health insurance coverage rather than funding hospitals for uncompensated care funding is the best way to ensure affordable health care access and would be a metric used to evaluate the LIP proposal.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Gov.
