The Nebraska Hospital Association says the state is passing up an economic opportunity by refusing to expand Medicaid.

Nebraska Hospital Association is touting a study by University of Nebraska-Kearney professors which concludes Medicaid expansion would draw down billions of federal funds and sustain nearly 47,000 jobs.

The Unicameral will once again consider expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, this time legislators will debate the merits of the Medicaid Redesign Act, LB 472. The bill proposes to extend Medicaid health coverage benefits to approximately 79,000 Nebraskans who do not have health care coverage.

The study is entitled, “Nebraska Medicaid Expansion: Protecting a Critical Infrastructure, Supporting Main Street, Improving Worker Productivity.” It was prepared by economics professor and management professor Ron Konecny with UNK.

The study claims the state could save throughout its budget if the legislature expands Medicaid, businesses would save on Affordable Care Act penalties, and fewer Nebraskans would have to declare bankruptcy in the face of mounting medical bills.

The study concludes that while expansion would cost the state $81 million over a five-year period, will would recapture more than $2.1 billion in federal funds the first five years of expansion.

Medicaid expansion would support 10,000 jobs by 2020, according to the study, while avoiding the possibility of losing 31,000 jobs in jeopardy with scheduled Medicare reimbursement cuts.

The Nebraska Hospital Association and AARP funded the study.
