If that was the aim, it backfired.\n\nInstead, the killing of dozens of troops \u2014 most of them from the United Arab Emirates \u2014 has upended much of the ambiguity about the U.S.-backed coalition\u2019s boots-on-the-ground role in Yemen and is prompting the alliance to intensify what has effectively become a proxy war against Iran.\n\nIn the eyes of many across the Sunni-ruled Gulf states, Yemen \u2014 with its Iranian-backed Houthis \u2014 has become a key battleground in a Middle Eastern twist on the Cold War domino theory: if Iran cannot be checked in Yemen, the thinking goes, it could ramp up the pressure in Shiite-majority Bahrain and elsewhere in the region.\n\nPHOTOS: Gulf stiffens determination in wake of troop deaths in Yemen\n\nThe missile assault on Friday struck an ammunition depot in the Yemeni province of Marib, about 120 kilometers (75 miles) east of the capital, Sanaa.\n\nHardest hit in the attack was the UAE, a federation of seven states that includes Dubai and the oil-rich capital, Abu Dhabi, which lost 45 soldiers. Ten Saudis were killed in the blast too. Bahrain also lost five soldiers, though it was not clear if they were killed in the same incident.\n\nEmirati fighter planes have responded to the attack by pounding positions and arms caches used by Iranian-backed Shiite rebels known as Houthis - rebels that the Gulf states see as little more than tools of Tehran. Iran supports the Houthis politically but denies arming them.\n\nThe Gulf nation of Qatar significantly ramped up its involvement in the conflict on Monday, deploying about 1,000 ground troops backed by armored vehicles and Apache helicopters, according to Yemeni officials and the Qatar-based Al Jazeera television. Qatar neither confirmed nor denied its role.\n\n\u201cOur armed forces \u2026 are more resolved and determined to liberate Yemen and flush out the scum after the tragic incident,\u201d Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the powerful Abu Dhabi crown prince and deputy supreme commander of the UAE armed forces, assured visiting Yemeni President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi after the attack.\n\nRadio stations across the UAE have replaced their usual upbeat fare with Quranic recitations and classical music to mark three days of mourning commemorating the unprecedented war loss - an honor typically reserved for the country\u2019s top leaders.\n\nSheikh Mohammed and other top government officials visited families of killed soldiers. Outside medical clinics, Emirati men in traditional white garments known as thobes have been lining up to give blood for those still recovering from the attack.\n\nThe managing editor of the widely read UAE daily Gulf News, Mohammed Almezel, suggested in an op-ed that the deaths were a \u201cPearl Harbor moment\u201d that will strengthen the Emirates\u2019 determination in Yemen. He described the fight as \u201cpart of a strategic decision to defend and preserve the security and stability of the Gulf strategic hemisphere.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe cowardly attack in Marib will not intimidate the Arab coalition into abdicating its responsibility of defending justice and supporting the right of the Yemeni people,\u201d he wrote.\n\nMustafa Alani, the director of the security and defense department at the Gulf Research Center in Geneva, said that rather than spooking it, Friday\u2019s attack will likely prod the coalition to \u201cfinish the job in Yemen under any circumstance.\u201d\n\nMany in Gulf states such as Saudi Arabia and the Emirates support the war and will likely continue to do so despite the casualties, as a way to check what they see as Iran\u2019s expansionist policies in the region, Alani said.\n\n\u201cThis is not a battle for Yemen,\u201d Alani said. \u201cThe great majority of the population understands it\u2019s much wider than that. It\u2019s a strategic confrontation, and they are ready to sacrifice.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is a matter of survival in the region,\u201d Alani added.\n\nThat sentiment was echoed by businessman Abdullah al-Musa outside a Dubai mosque. He described the fight in Yemen as a way to ultimately help the Emirates.\n\n\u201cThey are our neighbors. If there is a problem in your neighbor\u2019s house, tomorrow it will be in your house,\u201d he said.\n\nThe U.S.-backed coalition has been carrying out airstrikes since March in a bid to halt the Houthi rebel power grab that captured Sanaa and areas in the country\u2019s north last year. The push forced Hadi and his government into exile in Saudi Arabia, and for a while the rebels held the strategic southern port city of Aden until pro-government forces pushed the rebels out.\n\nThe fighting in Yemen, the Arab world\u2019s poorest country, has killed more than 2,100 civilians, according to figures from the United Nations.\n\nThe Gulf states had maintained a policy of ambiguity about their role on the ground even as it became clearer that they were deploying troops and hardware.\n\nAlani, who has close ties to Saudi officials, said the Gulf troops inside Yemen include special forces soldiers and airpower support specialists, as well as armored units that arrived more recently.\n\nThe bulk of the fighting on the ground is being done by Yemenis, including infantry soldiers trained inside Saudi Arabia, he said. Alani predicted the Gulf coalition would pump more soldiers and equipment into the country in the wake of Friday\u2019s attack.\n\nThe UAE is a major buyer of military hardware and has increasingly deployed troops on military and humanitarian missions abroad. It last year began requiring compulsory military service for adult males, and it is one of the most prominent Arab members of the U.S.-led aerial campaign against Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria.\n\nAt least five other members of the Emirati military have been killed in Yemen this year, and another died during training exercises related to the operation in Saudi Arabia.\n\nTheodore Karasik, a Dubai-based geopolitical analyst, agreed that Friday\u2019s attack is unlikely to deter the Emirates.\n\n\u201cYemen is part of the strategic calculation of the UAE,\u201d he said, citing Emirati concerns not just about close ally Saudi Arabia\u2019s security but also about freedom of navigation in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden off Yemen\u2019s shores.\n\nThe Emirates relies heavily on international trade and Dubai\u2019s government-backed DP World is one of the world\u2019s largest seaport operators. The country is also a major backer of Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, whose country\u2019s Suez Canal depends on open sea lanes in the Red Sea.\n\nA somber scene Saturday perhaps best reflected UAE\u2019s resolve over Yemen - the coffins of the fallen Emirati soldiers were brought home by plane to the Al Bateen Airport in Abu Dhabi. The caskets, each draped in the Emirati flag, were then carried down a red carpet as an honor guard stood by on the tarmac.\n\nThe soldiers\u2019 final return is since being replayed on state-owned television, along with patriotic file footage of Emirati troops and fighter planes in action.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A deadly attack late last week on soldiers from oil-rich Gulf states deployed in Yemen as part of a Saudi-led coalition fighting the country's Shiite rebels may well have been designed to break the coalition's will.
