But a new study illustrates how federal policies influence the NP workforce and practice, and how misalignment of those policies with state mandates can affect workforce supply and patient access to care.\n\n\u201cFederal Polices Influence Access to Primary Care and Nurse Practitioner Workforce,\u201d published in the May issue of The Journal for Nurse Practitioners, was authored by J. Margo Brooks Carthon, PhD, RN, University of Pennsylvania School of Nursing Assistant Professor of Nursing, and two research fellows at the School: Hilary Barnes, PhD, CRNP; and Danielle Altares Sarik, MSN, CRNP. The authors are affiliated with the School\u2019s Center for Health Outcomes and Policy Research, a research and research training enterprise focusing on the outcomes of health care and health workforce policy.\n\n\u201cWhile much of the literature on NPs and primary care focus on the impact of state-level scope of practice restrictions, this paper offers a new contribution to the literature in that it examines implications of federal policy,\u201d says Dr. Brooks Carthon.\n\nThe study illustrates that while the goals of the ACA to increase access to primary care are linked to efficient use of NPs as care providers, it is just as imperative that federal initiatives include reliable funding to support NP training, education and models of care where NPs practice. It also shows that federal efforts may be hampered by state policies that restrict NPs scope of practice.\n\n\u201cExamining federal policies in tandem with state-level regulations is essential to achieving increased NP workforce supply and improved access to care,\u201d says Dr. Brooks Carthon.\n\nThe research is particularly timely in light of current legislation pending in Pennsylvania to remove mandatory collaborative agreements (SB 717 and HB 765). Collaborative agreements are business contracts that NPs in Pennsylvania are required to maintain with two physicians in order to practice. Twenty states and the District of Columbia have already eliminated such agreements.\n\n\u201cIf this legislation passes, it should increase patient access to care in Pennsylvania,\u201d says Brooks Carthon.\n\nResearch in this press release is supported by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the National Institute of Nursing Research, National Institutes of Health.\n\n\n\nReporters: follow Looking for a different expert?
