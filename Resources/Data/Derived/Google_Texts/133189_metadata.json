Nikki Haley brushed aside talk over the weekend about all the political attention she is suddenly receiving.\n\nThe one-time Tea Party conservative and the first woman and first racial minority ever to be elected governor of her state has captured the nation\u2019s attention with her dignified, sure-footed handling of the aftermath of the massacre of nine African Americans by a white supremacist in a Charleston, S.C., church last month.\n\nRelated: South Carolina\u2019s Confederate Flag Joins Museum Collection\n\nNow there is renewed speculation about Haley as a possible vice presidential running mate in the 2016 GOP presidential contest.\n\nWhile her state and the nation were still mourning over the shootings at the historic black Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church June 17, the two-term governor swiftly and deftly convinced a hidebound state legislature to vote to lower and remove a Confederate battle flag that had flown over the South Carolina Statehouse for the past half century.\n\nThat flag had long been a symbol of slavery and southern defiance of the civil rights movement, and many viewed it as an affront to the death of one of the victims, the Rev. Clementa Pinckney, a state legislator whose body lay in state at the capitol.\n\nShortly after she signed the bill into law last Friday, a seven-man South Carolina Highway Patrol Honor Guard, which included two African-Americans, slowly lowered the banner from its pole alongside a Confederate memorial near the Capitol.\n\n\u201cI think it meant a lot of things to a lot of different people,\u201d Haley told Chuck Todd of NBC\u2019s Meet the Press on Sunday in discussing the import of that moment while brushing aside any discussion of all the national attention she is suddenly receiving. \u201cWhat I can tell you was it felt like a massive weight had been lifted off South Carolina. We can truly say it's a new day in South Carolina.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was emotional,\u201d she added. \u201cYou know, I think that it was hard for me to look at that flag coming down and not think about the Emanuel Nine, not think about those nine people who took in someone that didn't look like them, didn't sound like them, and accepted him and prayed with him for an hour [before he shot them]. It is hard for us to not think about those nine people.\u201d\n\nHaley\u2019s success marked a stunning evolution for a politician \u201cwho first ran for governor as a state lawmaker waving the tea party banner, but who was also subjected to ethnic slurs from her own side,\u201d The Washington Post noted recently. \u201cOnce in office, she initially struggled to cope with South Carolina\u2019s white, male-dominated establishment \u2014 often reluctant to insert herself into racial politics \u2014 only to emerge now as a prominent and confident leader of the New South.\u201d\n\nRelated: South Carolina\u2019s Leaders Unite to Call for Removal of Confederate Flag\n\nHaley was born Nimrata Nikki Randhawa to Sikh parents who had emigrated from India to Bamberg, S.C. Her father was a biology professor and her mother ran a gift shop. She got an accounting degree at Clemson University, where she met her husband, Michael Haley, according to the Almanac of American Politics. She later worked for a waste-management company before deciding to challenge veteran Republican state Rep. Larry Koon. Haley went on to win on a strong platform of fiscal conservatism and tax relief.\n\nIn 2010, she was elected governor, succeeding Republican Mark Sanford, a close ally at the time.\n\nDuring the 2012 presidential campaign, Haley frequently turned up on lists of GOP vice presidential possibilities, although Republican nominee Mitt Romney ultimately picked Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) ahead of Haley and a dozen others who were thought to be in the running.\n\nIn the wake of her extraordinary performance in dealing with the shootings and Confederate flag controversy, Haley suddenly has moved into the national spotlight. But with so many family members and friends of the victims and others still struggling to make sense of the killings, Haley appears embarrassed to discuss the possible political ramifications for her career down the road.\n\nRelated: Confederate Flag: A Small Step for Nikki Haley, a Big Move for the GOP\n\nWhen Todd asked Haley what she made of \u201cthe extra political attention you\u2019ve been getting,\u201d Haley replied that it was \u201cpainful\u201d because \u201cnine people died in Charleston.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the Nikki Haley interview with Chuck Todd of Meet the Press.\n\nThe full clip from Meet The Press:\n\nAs time goes by and the 2016 South Carolina presidential primary approaches in late February, Haley inevitably will be the topic of intense speculation as a raft of Republican presidential candidates court her support and drop hints that she is among their favorites for a second spot on the ticket.\n\nMonths before the Charleston tragedy, Haley was already meeting with political suitors. During one appearance with former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Haley led the press conference that followed, making it clear that she would be closely questioning all the candidates who came through about their stands on the issues as they affected South Carolinians, according to one report.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about taking pictures and holding a baby. We\u2019re going to talk about South Carolina issues,\u201d Haley said of the coming visits of presidential hopefuls. \u201cAnd the candidates who come here and figure out what those issues are, I appreciate, and you should too. \u201c\n\nRelated: South Carolina Governor Takes Aim at Union 'Bullies' in Boeing Labor Vote\n\nAccording to Real Clear Politics, Haley and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker were elected the same year \u2013 2010 -- and have been friendly since, sharing a strong antipathy towards unions. Haley, for example, has actively opposed efforts to unionize a Boeing plant in her state. Haley campaigned for Walker in his 2011 recall election, and Walker returned the favor by campaigning for Haley\u2019s reelection in 2013.\n\nHaley also is close to New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, and is on friendly terms with Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who is seeking the GOP presidential nomination, as well as Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, another GOP presidential aspirant.\n\nAs for Haley\u2019s prospects for a second spot on the 2016 GOP presidential ticket, it is much too soon to say. But there is little doubt she will be generating a lot more interest than she did in the last election.\n\nRelated: Now It\u2019s Congress in an Uproar Over the Confederate Flag\n\n\u201cShe is not at the top, no,\u201d said University of Virginia political scientist Larry J. Sabato in an email on Monday. \u201cShe will be on the long and maybe the short list, inevitably. How high on the list will depend on the nominee for president and his needs.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs we've learned many times, vice presidential candidates usually do less than advertised,\u201d he said. \u201cWould Haley cause a rush of women to the GOP ticket? Almost certainly no. See Palin, Sarah. And minorities? Doubtful. She might have some impact on Asian-Americans (5 percent of the national vote). Haley is from South Carolina, a guaranteed GOP state in November, so no bonus electoral votes.\n\nSo has she helped her chances with the Confederate flag issue? Yes, says Sabato. \u201cDoes it guarantee her selection or even her placement at the top of the list of possibles?
