The money will go toward housing and food for workers who are experiencing direct impacts from the water shortage, bond funds that will finance projects enabling local communities to capture and manage water more efficiently, and help procure emergency drinking water for communities whose supply is dwindling.\n\nBrown had declared a drought emergency in January as the state acknowledged its driest period in recorded history. The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation had also announced on February 21 that water levels were too low for it to release irrigation waters to farmers, households and businesses that rely on the flow, the Associated Press reported.\n\nRELATED: California Governor Declares Drought Emergency\n\nAlthough a large part of the state got much-needed precipitation via a winter storm on February 27 and 28, it was not enough to make up for years without water.\n\n\u201cLike the rain this weekend, this package is badly needed to help mitigate the effects of the historic drought California is facing. But also like the rain, we need to see more,\u201d said Assembly Speaker John A. P\u00e9rez in the governor\u2019s statement. \u201cThat\u2019s why every Californian needs to continue to conserve water, and there\u2019s more work to do on storage, water quality improvement and environmental protections. If we don\u2019t act now, the problems we face will only get worse.\u201d\n\nThe Hoopa Tribe is among the communities that are suffering the effects of too little water, though it was not immediately clear how much of the aid would go to tribes specifically.\n\nRELATED: Hoopa Valley Tribe Declares Drought Emergency as California Dries Out", "article_metadata": {"description": "Recent rainstorms notwithstanding, California Governor Jerry Brown signed into law a $687 million drought-relief bill on March 1.California Governor Jerry Brown Signs $687 Million drought relief bill.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "theresa", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/03/01/california-governor-signs-687-million-drought-relief-bill-153813", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/california_drought-rich_pedroncelli_fileassociated_press.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "California Governor Signs $687 Million Drought Relief Bill"}, "dcterms.date": "2014-03-01T19:30-05:00", "dc": {"title": "California Governor Signs $687 Million Drought Relief Bill"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/03/01/california-governor-signs-687-million-drought-relief-bill-153813", "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Drought, California, Jerry Brown, Governor Jerry Brown, drought relies", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.title": "California Governor Signs $687 Million Drought Relief Bill"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcab68\"", "article_summary": "Recent rainstorms notwithstanding, California Governor Jerry Brown signed into law a $687 million drought-relief bill on March 1.\nRELATED: Hoopa Valley Tribe Declares Drought Emergency as California Dries Out\n\u201cLike the rain this weekend, this package is badly needed to help mitigate the effects of the historic drought California is facing.\nBrown had declared a drought emergency in January as the state acknowledged its driest period in recorded history.\n\u201cLegislators across the aisle have now voted to help hard-pressed communities that face water shortages,\u201d said Brown in a statement."}
