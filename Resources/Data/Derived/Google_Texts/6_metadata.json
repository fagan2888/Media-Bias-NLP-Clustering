They have unqualified political analysts. We need FCC to monitor and regulate them. \u2014 DickinsonForCongress (@VoteMike2014) February 18, 2014\n\nBoy, did Hannity have a blast poking at the exaggerations and distortions in that one. Here\u2019s how he kicked things off, asking Dickinson, \u201cAll day long, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, we\u2019ve never told the truth ever on Fox. All we do is tell lies. We do nothing but tell lies? That\u2019s all we\u2019ve ever done is tell lies?\u201d\n\nImprisoned by his own sweeping absurdity, Dickinson eventually got a chance to defend his allegations and pointed toward Hannity\u2019s treatment of Obamacare: \u201cAll right, all you do on yourshow is promote Obamacare, you say this, that, and implying it\u2019s socialism. The American people that I\u2019ve talked to that don\u2019t understand what the Affordable Care Act is about is ridiculous. They all have this idea it\u2019s socialism. They all have this idea it\u2019s big government.\u201d\n\nSo you want to talk Obamacare, huh? Hannity surmised. The host then hammered away at President Obama\u2019s misleading statement that Americans could keep existing insurance plans. Said Hannity regarding Obama: \u201cThe bottom line is, he told lies and mistruths, the very criticism you have against us, and yet you support him. What does that make you?\u201d\n\nDickinson never managed to get back on his feet. The interview ended on a classically sour note from Hannity: \u201cGood luck to you. You\u2019re going to lose. I\u2019ll put any amount of money on it. You\u2019re going to lose badly. Goodbye.\u201d\n\nServes Dickinson right for not keeping abreast of the Erik Wemple Blog. Had he sampled our 21-post series on Fox News\u2019s fall 2012 Benghazi reporting, he might have had some material to throw at Hannity. After all, the network\u2019s towering \u201cscoop\u201d from October of that year contains very few claims unmolested by debunking.\n\nYet no reporting in this space or any other could possibly excuse or support Dickinson\u2019s reckless and big-brotherly call for Federal Communications Commission monitoring of Fox News content nor his risible comment that Fox News commentators are unqualified, as if the commentators on other networks are all geniuses.\n\n(h/t Mediaite)", "article_metadata": {"description": "Challenger also wants FCC monitoring of network.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/erik.wemple", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Challenger also wants FCC monitoring of network.", "title": "Fox News\u2019s Sean Hannity destroys Democratic pol who accused Fox of lying", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2014/02/26/fox-newss-sean-hannity-destroys-democratic-pol-who-accused-fox-of-lying/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=https://img.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-3000x1568.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@ErikWemple"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2014/02/26/fox-newss-sean-hannity-destroys-democratic-pol-who-accused-fox-of-lying/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Fox News, Sean Hannity, Mike Dickinson, Obamacare, Eric Cantor,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/erik.wemple"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Fox News, Sean Hannity, Mike Dickinson, Obamacare, Eric Cantor,"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc936d\"", "article_summary": "Watch the latest video at video.foxnews.comFox News does nothing but tell lies and mistruths.\nWe do nothing but tell lies?\nAll we do is tell lies.\nSaid Hannity regarding Obama: \u201cThe bottom line is, he told lies and mistruths, the very criticism you have against us, and yet you support him.\nHad he sampled our 21-post series on Fox News\u2019s fall 2012 Benghazi reporting, he might have had some material to throw at Hannity."}
