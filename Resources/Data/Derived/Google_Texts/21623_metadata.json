According to a report in The New York Times, Kushner says he wanted to create an experience \u201clike having a doctor in the family.\u201d\n\nOscar currently only serves New York City and a few other counties in lower New York state. Yet Kushner says the firm aims to eventually expand across the country, a process made easier by already being licensed in one state.\n\nOscar still charges deductibles and monthly payments, however, the insurer focuses on offering other services intended to make life easier for patients, including free generic drugs, free calls to doctors and a handful of free primary care appointments.\n\nThe start-up also emphasizes design and technology. It has an online search function that lets patients type in their symptoms in natural language and then steers them to a doctor that meets their needs.\n\nSince October the company has grown rapidly. After an initial round of fundraising that netted about $35 million, the insurer is valued at approximately $340 million.\n\nAmong the investors are Kushner\u2019s private-equity and venture-capital firm, Thrive Capital, as well as the Founders Fund, Khosla Ventures and General Catalyst Partners.\n\nJosh Kushner is the son of real estate developer Charles Kushner and the younger brother of Jared Kushner, CEO of the family real estate company, owner of The New York Observer and husband of Ivanka Trump. Thrive Capital has raised $200 million since it debuted three years ago.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Venture capitalist and real estate scion Joshua Kushner, 28, has raised $30 million in a new round of funding for his latest venture, health insurer Oscar.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.1", "og": {"site_name": "IFAwebnews.com", "description": "Venture capitalist and real estate scion Joshua Kushner, 28, has raised $30 million in a new round of funding for his latest venture, health insurer Oscar.", "title": "Wunderkind investor raises additional $30M to launch new health insurer", "url": "http://ifawebnews.com/2014/01/15/wunderkind-investor-raises-additional-30m-to-launch-new-health-insurer/", "image": "http://ifawebnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Kushner-Joshua.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary"}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-15T15:28:53+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-15T15:29:33+00:00"}, "verify-v1": "Fve8IDDdj94aX4Ar18+v33qGgAesGnY2YiqbnR5P17I="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcab1d\"", "article_summary": "Venture capitalist and real estate scion Joshua Kushner, 28, has raised $30 million in a new round of funding for his latest venture, health insurer Oscar.\nAfter an initial round of fundraising that netted about $35 million, the insurer is valued at approximately $340 million.\nJosh Kushner is the son of real estate developer Charles Kushner and the younger brother of Jared Kushner, CEO of the family real estate company, owner of The New York Observer and husband of Ivanka Trump.\nKushner, who serves as Oscar\u2019s chairman, and his co-founders Kevin Nazemi and Mario Schlosser, are betting that technology and good customer service can transform the industry.\nYet Kushner says the firm aims to eventually expand across the country, a process made easier by already being licensed in one state."}
