But in addition to standard financial disclosure, the companies must lay out their social and environmental commitments and detail each year publicly what they have achieved.\n\nWhether that is good enough is still an open question, however.\n\nGeorgetown University Law School and Independent Sector, an advocacy group for nonprofits, foundations and corporations, jointly sponsored a conference in April that looked at some of the growing pains of the movement. In a post-conference summary, the Nonprofit Quarterly looked at some of the issues raised by participants at the April gathering. Among them:\n\n\u2022 Can social enterprises and benefit corporations regulate themselves, or should there be a separate overseer to ensure their performance matches their promises? States vary widely in the documentation they demand over whether benefit corporations are performing as advertised, and many businesses in the movement have been resistant to oversight.\n\n\u201cIf we start to overregulate this form, [we\u2019ll have] no one going into this,\u201d one participant warned.\n\n\u2022 How do benefit corporations differ from traditional nonprofits, and can the two sectors work together? Will for-profit socially conscious companies be seen by consumers and supporters as traditional charities, and is there a government role in making the distinction clear?\n\n\u2022 How do states ensure a benefit corporation remains true to its mission over the long term, and what recourse do regulators and shareholders have if a company does stray? Benefit corporation backers say shareholders have a private right of action to sue if they think the company is not delivering its promised social benefits, but to date, not a single such suit has been filed.\n\nAnd conference participants raised concerns that benefit corporations will be tempted to seek out government subsidies and other regulatory breaks just the way traditional for-profit companies have always done.\n\n\u201cTo think that for-profit social enterprises won\u2019t follow the less-than-free-market model of other corporations seeking multiple government subsidies is to fall for the halo effect, that these for-profit entrepreneurs will adjure the tax incentives and funding subsidies that other corporations have typically sought, no matter what kind of endeavor,\u201d wrote author Rick Cohen in the Nonprofit Quarterly survey.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The sharp rise in the number of benefit corporations has also led to some sharp questions about whether the socially-conscious but for-profit companies are delivering on their promises.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The sharp rise in the number of benefit corporations has also led to some sharp questions about whether the socially-conscious but for-profit companies are delivering on their promises.", "title": "Benefit corporations raise legal, regulatory questions", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/dec/7/benefit-corporations-raise-legal-regulatory-questi/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/07/screen-shot-2014-12-07-at-63357-pm.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/07/screen-shot-2014-12-07-at-63357-pm.png", "description": "The sharp rise in the number of benefit corporations has also led to some sharp questions about whether the socially-conscious but for-profit companies are delivering on their promises.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Benefit corporations raise legal, regulatory questions"}, "Author": "David R.
