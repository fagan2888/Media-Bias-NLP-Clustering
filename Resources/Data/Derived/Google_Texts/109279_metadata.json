The thing where Obamacare makes it illegal for health insurance companies to discriminate against women on the basis of their gender, according to Fox Business News\u2019s John Stossel.\n\n\u201cWhen did you last go to the doctor?,\u201d he asked Steve Doocy yesterday. \u201cElizabeth\u2019s going to answer quite quickly. Women go to the doctor much more often than men. Maybe they\u2019re smarter, or maybe they\u2019re hypochondriacs. They live longer. But if it\u2019s insurance, you ought to be able to charge the people who use the services more, more.\u201d\n\nAnd if women are not hypochondriacs, Doocy pointed out, they're probably just pregnant. \u201cAs a number of Republicans have made the argument, why should I pay for \u2014 I\u2019m in my 60s, why should I pay for your maternity coverage?\u201d he asked.\n\nThat's a slight mischaracterization of the \"gender rating\" practice the Affordable Care Act made illegal. According to the National Women's Law Center, insurers charged women in the individual health insurance market approximately $1 billion more annually on their premiums alone, regardless of how many times they went to the doctor, and regardless of whether they had a baby. In 88 percent of individual market plans, maternity costs extra.\n\nSomewhere off-camera, Megyn Kelly glared at the monitor, snapping a pencil in frustration.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#000", "description": "Are we pregnant or are we hypochondriacs?", "generator": "the-factory", "og": {"site_name": "The Cut", "description": "Are we pregnant or are we hypochondriacs?", "title": "Fox News: Women Should Pay More for Health Insurance", "url": "http://nymag.com/thecut/2013/11/fox-news-women-should-pay-more-for-health-care.html", "image": "http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2013/11/01/01-stossel.w1200.h630.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Are we pregnant or are we hypochondriacs?", "creator": "@kstoeffel", "image": "http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2013/11/01/01-stossel.w190.h190.2x.jpg", "title": "Fox News: Women Should Pay More for Health Care", "site": "@TheCut", "card": "summary"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The Cut", "fb": {"app_id": 343556435754245}, "msapplication-TileImage": "//cache.nymag.com/media/thecut/icon.144x144.png", "application-name": "The Cut", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "pre-existing conditions, love and war, health insurance, affordable care act, gender rating", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Cut", "tag": "pre-existing conditions,love and war,health insurance,affordable care act,gender rating", "published_time": "2013-11-01T15:18:00.000Z"}, "topics": "topics-test, pre-existing conditions, love and war, health insurance, affordable care act, gender rating", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0071\"", "article_summary": "Maybe they\u2019re smarter, or maybe they\u2019re hypochondriacs.\nThe thing where Obamacare makes it illegal for health insurance companies to discriminate against women on the basis of their gender, according to Fox Business News\u2019s John Stossel.\n\u201cAs a number of Republicans have made the argument, why should I pay for \u2014 I\u2019m in my 60s, why should I pay for your maternity coverage?\u201d he asked.\nWomen go to the doctor much more often than men.\nIn 88 percent of individual market plans, maternity costs extra."}
