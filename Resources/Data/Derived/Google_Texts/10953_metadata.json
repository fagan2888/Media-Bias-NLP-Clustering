They then lift the chip\u2019s data as it is read by the ATM. The shimmer can apparently be slipped straight into a typical ATM.\n\nThe push for chip-enabled cards in the U.S. began in earnest in early 2014 following massive data breaches at Target and Home Depot.\n\nIn both instances, hackers lifted tens of millions of people\u2019s payment card information from the terminals where shoppers swipe their cards.\n\nThe U.S. lags behind much of the world in payment card technology.\n\nMost developed countries have switched to chip-and-PIN or chip-and-signature technology. In both instances, the chip helps lock down payment card data during purchases. The signature or PIN then serves as a second form of verification. Security specialists have pushed for a move to chip-and-PIN because signatures can be forged.\n\nMost European countries that have moved to chip-and-PIN have seen enormous drops in in-store credit card fraud.\n\nBut the revelation that chip-enabled cards are not necessarily safe at ATMs highlights a new front in cybercrime.\n\n\"ATMs are designed for magnetic stripe cards and PINs, which are severely outdated and about as secure as a username and password,\u201d said John Gunn, vice president of Corporate Communications at Vasco Data Security, which provides security products for banks, by email. \u201cThis is why ATM skimming remains one of the leading causes of fraud losses for banks. As online and mobile banking become more secure, we will see a big increase in ATM attacks.\u201d\n\nThe ultimate solution, Gunn suggests, is integrating an ATM trip with some type of interaction on a smartphone banking app.\n\nThat way, he said, \u201cwe can detect ATM fraud in more than a dozen ways and virtually eliminate the threat of skimming.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The discovery raises questions about ATM and chip-based card security.", "description": "The discovery raises questions about ATM and chip-based card security.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Cory Bennett", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The discovery raises questions about ATM and chip-based card security.", "title": "Fraudsters skim chip-enabled cards at ATMs", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/250852-fraudsters-skimming-chip-enabled-cards-at-atms", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T05:25-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/250852-fraudsters-skimming-chip-enabled-cards-at-atms", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2015-08-11T14:51-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Cory Bennett", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-11T14:51:58-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00"}, "keywords": ",,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/250852-fraudsters-skimming-chip-enabled-cards-at-atms", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The discovery raises questions about ATM and chip-based card security.", "card": "summary", "title": "Fraudsters skim chip-enabled cards at ATMs"}, "dcterms.title": "Fraudsters skim chip-enabled cards at ATMs"}, "article_summary": "Fraudsters have started dropping devices into ATMs that can steal data off chip-enabled credit or debit cards.\nBut the revelation that chip-enabled cards are not necessarily safe at ATMs highlights a new front in cybercrime.\nThese devices, known as \u201cshimmers,\u201d lie between the chip on the card and the ATM\u2019s chip reader.\nThe push for chip-enabled cards in the U.S. began in earnest in early 2014 following massive data breaches at Target and Home Depot.\nIn both instances, hackers lifted tens of millions of people\u2019s payment card information from the terminals where shoppers swipe their cards."}
