Think of it as a reward or loyalty card, but we don\u2019t give points, we don\u2019t give coffees, we give property tax credit,\u201d de Falco said.\n\nThe program is pretty straightforward.\n\nGo into a participating local restaurant or store, hand over your rewards card when you check out and a percentage of your bill \u2014 pre-determined by each business owner \u2014 will go toward your third-quarter tax bill.\n\nSo if you spend $100 on dinner at a local restaurant that\u2019s chosen to give back 10 percent, Fincredit will take $2.50 for process fees and put $7.50 toward your reward account. If you\u2019re a renter or just frequent the township and live elsewhere, the rewards come back in the form of an annual check.\n\nThat $7.50 here and there can add up, he said.\n\nIn the pilot town of Marlboro, where Fincredit is based, the reward program saw more than $360,000 in bulk sales in its first fiscal year, with more than $20,000 going toward offsetting property tax bills. He expects that number to bump up to $60,000 to $70,000 in the near future, and said they\u2019ve already grown to include six other municipalities in the state, including Highland Park, Bayonne, West Orange and, most recently, Voorhees. More than a dozen others are in talks to be next.\n\nThe boon for businesses \u2014 since they\u2019re the ones doling out funds \u2014 is that residents aiming to make the most of the program will specifically seek them out and drive up sales.\n\n\u201cEveryone who walks around with this card is a potential customer,\u201d said de Falco.\n\nWhile businesses aren\u2019t required to purchase equipment to participate \u2014 the reward cards can be manually entered online for free \u2014 Fincredit offers a card reader that can attach to a terminal for $50 or a separate, dial-up terminal for $160 with no per-swipe fees for higher volume businesses.\n\nThe municipality would oversee the parameters of how the program is applied in the township, including how it\u2019s promoted and whether or not big-box, chain stores would be welcomed to participate.\n\nA good start to the program would be about 15 to 20 businesses, said de Falco, with about half of those considered \u201chigh-volume.\u201d\n\nMarlboro currently has about 50 businesses signed up, and Voorhees has enlisted more than 30.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll grow, absolutely,\u201d de Falco said.\n\nThere\u2019s even a possibility local colleges or universities could take advantage of the program, de Falco said, by signing up and contributing a significant chunk of change toward a family\u2019s property tax bill when they pay their tuition bill.\n\nThere\u2019s no cost to the township for the program, and township CFO and Tax Collector Robin Sarlo told council the tax credits would be applied by their financial software in the same way they process similar adjustments, and wouldn\u2019t be an additional burden on their workload\n\nUsers would be able to use the www.propertytaxcard.com website to login and check how much tax relief they can expect, and Fincredit will handle the customer-service aspect of the program.\n\nIf Washington Township decides to sign on, it could be part of the first wave of a growing program, as Assemblyman Ron Dancer (R-Ocean) recently proposed legislation to \u201cfacilitate implementing this in as many townships as possible,\u201d de Falco said.\n\nRepublican Councilman Chris Del Borrello, who spearheaded the move to bring the Property Tax Rewards Program to the township after reading about Voorhees\u2019 involvement, said he\u2019s tried to find flaws, downsides or ways the system could fail, and he\u2019s come up empty.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a win-win for residents and local businesses,\u201d he said.\n\n---\n\nContact staff writer Michelle
