GRAND FALLS TOWNSHIP – Maine’s highest court is upholding a state Board of Environmental Protection decision to give a developer the go-ahead to build a wind farm on Passadumkeag Ridge in Grand Falls Township.

The Maine Supreme Judicial Court issued a ruling on Tuesday that affirmed the board’s decision.

The nonprofit Passadumkeag Mountain Friends had appealed the board’s decision.

The group argued that an earlier decision by the Department of Environmental Protection to deny the wind farm a permit should stand up.

The high court’s ruling affirms that a Texas-based developer can build 14 459-foot-tall turbines on the ridge.
