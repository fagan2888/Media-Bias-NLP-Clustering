A cop from Lakewood will soon be pounding the pavement in Boston when he runs in the 118th Boston Marathon this month.

Lakewood police Officer Jesus “Moose” Chavez, a 13-year veteran of the department, is among 24 officers nationwide running in part to raise funds for Cops for Kids With Cancer.

With two weeks of fundraising to go, the officers have raised about $250,000, according to Lakewood police.

Chavez is assigned to Lakewood’s juvenile-crime unit and is a school resource officer at Alameda High School. He’s also a member of Lakewood’s SWAT unit.

Chavez has run several marathons, as well as the Bolder Boulder and races in San Francisco, Chicago and Istanbul.

In October, Chavez ran the Rock ‘n’ Roll Denver Marathon, pushing Luke Olmsted, an Alameda sophomore with cerebral palsy, the length of the route in a three-wheeled carrier.

In fundraising efforts tied to the April 21 Boston race, Chavez has raised $15,000 locally, he said.

“I’m very excited,” Chavez said of his fundraising and opportunity in Boston, where the 2013 finish was marred by a tragic bombing. “You can’t set up a better marathon, something you want to be involved with this year, than the Boston Marathon. Running with folks who are affected by the bombing — how impactful is that?”

Chavez said raising money for cancer is a way to pay respect to an old friend and mentor, Philip McClelland, who died of cancer in 2006.

Before his death, McClelland made Chavez promise to fight cancer.

“Cancer beat him. He hoped I would help others fight cancer,” Chavez recalled. “It’s one of those things words can’t describe, the overwhelming feeling” of helping others.

A second promise McClelland, on his death bed, asked Chavez to keep: “That my tears would dry when the sun rises the next day.”

Running, raising money and helping others comes easy, Chavez said: “It’s been a blessing.”
