Steve Farley, D-Tucson, said Arizona needs to do more to protect this vulnerable population.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of potential abuse that can happen financially in the system here in Arizona with the population of seniors we have,\u201d he said.\n\nDot Esler, senior program manager for senior impact strategies at the United Way of Tucson and Southern Arizona, said seniors are also more susceptible to scams because they spend more time at home, making them available for phone calls and in-person pitches. When someone is socially isolated, he or she can be even more vulnerable, Esler said.\n\n\u201cThey may be making the decision based on an emotional reaction that if they had an opportunity to talk to somebody else, they might be able to see through that it was a scam or a fraud,\u201d she said.\n\nKathleen Waldron, professor at Arizona State University\u2019s New College, said the embarrassment might also lead seniors to not report that they have been scammed.\n\n\u201cThat embarrassment factor can also cause them not to want to tell anyone what\u2019s happened, which can then cause more stress,\u201d she said.\n\nMiranda Garcia, a Phoenix-based inspector for the U.S. Postal Service, said that mail fraud is traditionally underreported because of the embarrassment factor.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t want their family members or friends to know that they\u2019ve been \u201cduped\u201d or lost money,\u201d she said.\n\nKathleen Winn, the Arizona Attorney General\u2019s Office\u2019s community outreach director, said business and investment scams are popular in Arizona because many seniors are on fixed incomes. When seniors investors don\u2019t make money, the scam artists will try to sell them more investments with promises of returns, she said.\n\nWhile the Attorney General\u2019s Office does a good job taking down these businesses, new ones quickly sprout, Winn said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like Whac-a-Mole,\u201d she said.\n\nGarcia, the postal inspector, said foreign lotteries and sweepstakes scams are the most common scams committed by mail, adding that scammers will victimize a person again and again once they find success.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, if a victim does fall for one of these scams \u2013 let\u2019s say it\u2019s a foreign lottery or a sweepstakes-type deal \u2013 they\u2019re name is put on a list and is essentially sent out to all these other scammers,\u201d she said.\n\nGlen Spencer, program director for benefits assistance with the Area Agency on Aging in Phoenix, said scammers now use the Affordable Care Act as a way to obtain a senior citizen\u2019s personal information, threatening tax penalties someone doesn\u2019t provide a Social Security number, for example.\n\n\u201cThieves and criminals are playing on that fear factor with vulnerable populations that sometimes aren\u2019t as capable of discerning truth from fiction because of advanced age or illness,\u201d he said.\n\nThe so-called granny scam, in which someone posing as a grandchild calls or emails to say he or she is in trouble in a foreign country and needs money, is another popular method of preying on the elderly, Spencer said.\n\n\u201cPeople have to be wary about these things, and usually if they pick up the phone and call the individual, they find that they\u2019re right where they\u2019re supposed to be \u2013 in their own safe neck of the woods in the United States and not travelling and not in need or emergency funds,\u201d he said\n\nFarley, the Tucson lawmaker, authored unsuccessful bills during the past two legislative sessions that aimed to prevent financial exploitation of senior citizens. They would have required financial institutions to report suspicious activity, like withdrawals and wire transfers to Nigeria, to the Attorney General\u2019s Office.\n\n\u201cThere are people who are out there who are unfortunately predatory upon seniors who see them as being vulnerable, which they are,\u201d Farley said. \u201cInstead of protecting that vulnerability, they take advantage of the vulnerability. And that\u2019s something that we have to crack down upon.\u201d\n\nMelanie Starns, assistant director of the Arizona Department of Economic Security\u2019s Division of Aging and Adult Services, said educating seniors is an important part of cutting down on scams. Her agency and others, including the Arizona Attorney General\u2019s Office, hold an annual Scam Jam that includes education on the latest scams and identity theft.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a whole thing to educate the community \u2013 to educate older adults \u2013 about what\u2019s out there and how to protect themselves,\u201d Starns said.\n\nDavid Mitchell, Arizona AARP\u2019s senior state director, said the AARP is launching a pilot program, the Fraud Watch Network (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00m_w6904JM), to inform individuals about new scams and frauds through email alerts.\n\n\u201cThe thieves are pretty smart. They try to get out there and take advantage any kind of a situation,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Fraud Watch Network is designed to not only protect participants but inform others about new scams through word of mouth, Mitchell said.\n\n\u201cEmpower the individual and create a desire in that individual to share that information with their friends and loved ones,\u201d he said.\n\nTina Dannenfelser, program administrator for Adult Protective Services, part of the state Department of Economic Security, said that even with education some seniors will believe in a scam.\n\n\u201cWe have seniors that have sent literally tens of thousands of dollars to the lotteries,\u201d she said. \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter how many pamphlets we take them, doesn\u2019t matter how many times we tell them it\u2019s a scam. They continue to believe that they are going to be getting that money.\u201d\n\nWaldron, the ASU professor, said families should prepare for the possibility that elderly family members may lose their cognitive abilities and become vulnerable to scams.\n\n\u201cThose are conversations people need to have in their families before these things become an issue,\u201d she said. \u201cBut families don\u2019t like to talk those things.\u201d\n\nRobert Schneiderman, a Scottsdale resident whose father was a victim of financial exploitation in California, families should have plans for children to eventually assume control of their parents\u2019 finances, even if it requires some difficult conversations.\n\n\u201cKnowing that your family is protected \u2013 I don\u2019t just mean financially protected, but legally protected \u2013 from outside intrusion should make a family feel good,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "index.html", "image": "http://cronkitenews.asu.edu/assets/images/13/12/12-scams-front.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "PHOENIX \u2013 Told he had won $10 million in a sweepstakes, an older man insisted that he was going to Florida to collect despite objections from his family and even an explanation from the Arizona Attorney General\u2019s Office that he was being scammed.
