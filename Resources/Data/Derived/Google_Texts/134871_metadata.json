Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., chairman of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, said recently in frustration. \"This is the very first opportunity the administration has to write regulations on the Every Student Succeeds Act. In my view, they earned an 'F.'\"\n\nAlexander, never known as a partisan bombthrower, has also referred to the Education Department's behavior in this matter as \"brazen, deceitful, dishonest and unprofessional.\" He is outraged because the law he passed states specifically that the feds may not use it to \"mandate equalized spending per pupil for a state, local educational agency or school.\"\n\nBut that's exactly what the Education Department is trying to mandate now.\n\nAlexander said last week that when he confronted the department, \"they responded with a lot of gobbledy-gook.\" This week, he confronted Education Secretary John King in a hearing, telling him, \"The plain fact of the matter is that the law specifically says you cannot do it.\"\n\nFor the record, the non-partisan Congressional Research Service has weighed in on Alexander's side of the argument: \"It seems that a legal argument could be raised that [the Education Department] exceeded its statutory authority,\" CRS opined earlier this month.\n\nAlso from the Washington Examiner DHS disciplines 41 Secret Service agents for Chaffetz leak The Department of Homeland Security Department said Thursday that 41 Secret Service agents are being disciplined, after a watchdog report found personal information from Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, was leaked. Last September, the DHS Inspector General confirmed that several Secret Service agents accessed information about Chaffetz, now chairman of the House Oversight Committee, from an application he submitted for a job at the Secret Service in 2003. This information was also \"wrongfully\" leaked to the press. Of the 57 agents that were reviewed, 41 are \"receiving some level of discipline,\" said DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson in a statement.\n\nAlexander, speaking at The Atlantic's Education Summit on May 17, added that it might be \"a good idea\" to equalize funding throughout a state or local school district, but this would have to be a decision made at the state or local level.\n\n\"We said in December, in the law the president signed, that the federal government may not require equalized spending,\" he said. \"Yet the department precisely did that in its rule.\"\n\nKing and the Education Department face political pressure to implement the law in a particular way. Their problem is that this is a nation of laws. When executives want new powers, they cannot simply claim them. They need Congress to approve them.\n\nObama stands on the shoulders of his predecessors in ignoring Congress. He has said his agenda \"can't wait\" for the legislature to act \u2014 \"my ideas are so great, let the Constitution go hang\" \u2014 and even asserted unsuccessfully before the Supreme Court that he had a right to determine the rules of the Senate.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Congress writes the laws, as every boy and girl learns in school, and the president enforces them.
