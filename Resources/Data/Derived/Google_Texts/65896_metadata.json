Put the family bikes on a gondola \u2014 or rent them nearby \u2014 and take them to the bike park at the top of the mountain, where you can choose your adventure for 50 miles\u2019 worth of fun. Check out the fast-paced, expert-level downhill flow trails that come close to 2,200 vertical feet, or ride down the greens for a gentle, easygoing trip that still allows beginners to try out berms, banked turns and bridges, but only if they want to. Through Aug. 29, the bike park is open Wednesday-Friday until 7 p.m. for twilight runs, as well.\n\nLooking for something tamer? In town, the paved, multi-userecreation trail winds along the Yampa River for four miles, and has access points in quite a few places \u2014 including at West Lincoln Park and around downtown. There are designated picnic areas, and the route winds through botanical gardens.\n\nTo cool off, hop in a tube and take the scenic float down the Yampa. Several outfitters offer tubes for rent from 10:30 a.m.-4 p.m. daily (backdoorsports.com, buckingrainbow.com and onestopskishop.net). Cost is $18-$20, and the shops shuttle you back. The trip goes for two miles and takes one-three hours, depending on how fast you want to get out of the water.\n\nGet there: The bike park is at 2305 Mount Werner Circle, 970-879-6111, bike.steamboat.com. Bike access pass costs $37 adults, $27 under 12.\n\nDine: Good food at a Holiday Inn? Who knew? But Rex\u2019s American Grill & Bar (3190 S. Lincoln Ave., 970-870-0438, rexsgrill.com) is that rare treat; a casual eatery that works well for families, with reasonable prices, a huge patio with mountain views, live music most nights, excellent service and a menu of well-executed dishes that makes it hard to decide. Should you go with the remarkably not-greasy chicken-fried chicken with a side of cheddar mac or a crispy-edged brick-oven pizza topped with truffled steak (kids\u2019 versions available), or fish tacos with orange-scented rice?\n\nStay: The Porches (2096 Indian Summer Drive, Steamboat Springs, 866-500-6673, theporches.com) have everything a group needs to make a vacation happen \u2014 up to five bedrooms in a fully furnished house, including a well-stocked kitchen. And then there are the porches with their rocking chairs and views, and the \u201cbarn,\u201d a lodge of sorts, with a heated outdoor pool, hot tubs, billiards, kids\u2019 games, a fitness center and a steam room. You may never leave. Rates start at $575 a night for a four-bedroom or $3,625 per week.\n\nExperience family-friendly high country fun in \u2026", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Happy trails to you in Steamboat Springs, on a bike", "title": "Happy trails to you in Steamboat Springs, on a bike", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/07/10/happy-trails-to-you-in-steamboat-springs-on-a-bike/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140710__20140713_E12_TR13FAMILYFRIENDLY4p1.jpg", "height": 434}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140710__20140713_E12_TR13FAMILYFRIENDLY4p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-11T03:45:40+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T07:25:55+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd847e\"", "article_summary": "Through Aug. 29, the bike park is open Wednesday-Friday until 7 p.m. for twilight runs, as well.\nGet there: The bike park is at 2305 Mount Werner Circle, 970-879-6111, bike.steamboat.com.\nThe trip goes for two miles and takes one-three hours, depending on how fast you want to get out of the water.\nPut the family bikes on a gondola \u2014 or rent them nearby \u2014 and take them to the bike park at the top of the mountain, where you can choose your adventure for 50 miles\u2019 worth of fun.\nTo cool off, hop in a tube and take the scenic float down the Yampa."}
