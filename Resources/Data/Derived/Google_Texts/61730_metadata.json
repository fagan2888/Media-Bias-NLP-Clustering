Maass, BSPharm, JD. Pharmacist provider status recognition \u201cis not a singular effort or sprint. We need pharmacists\u2019 long-term engagement,\u201d she said.\n\nDefining provider status as \u201cpromoting patient access to, and coverage of, pharmacists\u2019 patient care services,\u201d Maass said that pharmacists\u2019 services, in coordination with other health care team members, include chronic disease management and education, medication management, health and wellness, and care transitions.\n\nMaass explained that pathways to provider status include seeking legislative and regulatory changes at the federal and state levels. Federal-level pathways include opportunities in Medicare Part B and Part D, the CMS Center for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation (CMMI), and Medicare accountable care organizations (ACOs). At the state level, there are a multitude of paths to provider status successes, including pursuing changes in Medicaid, health insurance exchanges, state employee health plans, and existing pharmacy scope and practice acts. Maass added that pharmacists\u2019 provider status is happening in the private sector as well, including opportunities in ACOs and medical homes and with private insurers.\n\nAt the state level, in 2015 and thus far in 2016, \u201cwe\u2019ve seen a huge uptick in the number of legislation compared with previous years,\u201d Maass said. This shows state policy makers recognize the value of pharmacists and their services.\n\nShe discussed scope components and opportunities, including collaborative practice agreements and statewide protocols. She also discussed payment for pharmacists\u2019 services, including recent successes in North Dakota, Washington state, Minnesota, and Ohio.\n\nAt the federal level, the Patient Access to Pharmacists\u2019 Care Coalition (PAPCC) has grown to nearly 40 organizations, including APhA. The coalition seeks provider status recognition for pharmacists, including passage of the Pharmacy and Medically Underserved Areas Enhancement Act (H.R. 592/S. 314), which would enable Medicare patients to access pharmacist-provided services under Medicare Part B. Currently, H.R. 592 has one original sponsor plus 269 cosponsors in the House, and S. 314 has one original sponsor plus 41 cosponsors in the Senate.\n\n\u201cTo have bipartisan health care legislation in this kind of political environment [that continues to include controversy over the Affordable Care Act] is a big success, and something our profession should be proud of,\u201d Maass said, noting the positive feedback for pharmacists on Capitol Hill.\n\nOn Monday, Advancing the Pharmacists\u2019 Role: Will Provider Status Fix Everything? featured presentations by Maass on a summary of her previous provider status talk; Washington State Pharmacy Association CEO Jeff Rochon, PharmD, on how SB 5557 required health plans to recognize pharmacists as patient care providers for covered benefits in Washington state; and Affinity Insurance Services Vice President Mark Buczko, CPCU, CIC, RPLU, on pharmacists\u2019 liability (which may expand as their roles expand, much as it did for nurse practitioners).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important\u2014when you\u2019re talking to a payer or physician\u2014that you talk about the value pharmacists can provide,\u201d Maass said.\n\nIn the Exposition area of the convention center, APhA engaged with attendees on provider status recognition at the Pharmacists Provide Care booth and the Government Affairs Advocacy Action Center booth.
