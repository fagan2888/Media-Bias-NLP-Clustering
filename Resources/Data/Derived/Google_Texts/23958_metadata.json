But more than 6 weeks after Hoffer first asked Gruber to provide evidence that these research assistants actually exist and did in fact perform work under the contract, Gruber has refused to provide Hoffer with the basic information he requested on the names, contact information, and employment status of this purported research assistants.\n\n\u201cI asked the administration [of Vermont Governor Peter Shumlin] to request information from Mr. Gruber. His response was forwarded to me and it did not contain the documentation I wanted. I will now communicate directly with Mr. Gruber and be more specific about what I need,\u201d Hoffer told Breitbart News in an exclusive email on Friday.\n\nGruber has also ignored requests from Breitbart News to provide copies of the cancelled checks of the payments he is supposed to have made to his purported research assistants.\n\nGruber had a July 2014 contract with the state to provide \u201ceconomic modeling\u201d to support the Governor\u2019s analysis of a now-shelved (for this year, anyway) single-payer health care plan. Under the terms of that contract, Gruber was to be paid $500 per hour for work he performed, and $100 per hour for work performed by research assistants under his direction.\n\nAll checks under this contract with the state of Vermont have been paid to Gruber as an individual. No checks were issued directly to the research assistants. Thus Gruber has been paid $160,000 against $200,000 in invoices he submitted to the state for 1,000 hours of work (billed at $100 per hour) he claimed research assistants performed under his direction as part of that contract and 200 hours of work (billed at $500 per hour) for work he claimed he performed.\n\nUnder the terms of the contract, the state has retained 20% of the amount billed by Gruber ($40,000 of the $200,000 billed) until the contract is deemed fully completed. To date, that full acceptance of Gruber\u2019s work has not been authorized.\n\nThe trouble with Gruber\u2019s billing practices is that, though he was personally paid the $80,000 for work allegedly performed by research assistants, the MIT professor has refused to provide any documentation to the state of Vermont that research assistants actually performed the 1,000 hours of work identified in his invoices as performed by them. Gruber\u2019s invoice merely asserted 1,000 hours were worked by unnamed research assistants, nothing more.\n\nIn November, after Gruber\u2019s controversial comments about the \u201cstupidity\u201d of the American voters was made public, the state of Vermont and Gruber agreed to change the amount paid under the original contract.\n\nGruber was originally to receive compensation totaling $450,000, but he agreed to accept a revised compensation totaling $280,000.\n\nThe state of Vermont agreed to pay Gruber the $40,000 retained against the $200,000 he had already billed, and an additional $80,000 for 800 hours of work to be performed by his research assistants between November and January 2015.\n\nWith the release of Governor Shumlin\u2019s final report on the shelved single-payer program in late December, Gruber\u2019s contract has presumably been completed.\n\nIt is unclear if Gruber has been paid the additional $120,000 specified in the revised November contract, which would bring the total amount the state of Vermont has paid him to $280,000.\n\nGruber\u2019s Nixonian stonewalling\u2014his refusal to provide what every accounting expert would call standard operating procedure billing documentation\u2013is yet another indication that Gruber is hiding behind the prestige of MIT and his association with the Obama administration.\n\n\u201cThe Gruber contract has been a travesty from start to finish,\u201d a senior contracts manager at the state of Vermont told Breitbart News on Friday, adding:\n\nThe contract was a bare-bones contract that omitted some of the most important provisions in the state\u2019s contract regulations. It was vaguely worded. There were no performance penalties because there were no specific performance measurements that were to be met as the project progressed. The only \u201cperformance\u201d required of Gruber was to be on the phone with Robin Lunge [the director of health reform for the state of Vermont] every day.\n\nFor her part, Lunge says: \u201cI feel confident that we\u2019ve gotten our money\u2019s worth in terms of both the amount of work as well as the quality of the work that we received,\u201d she told Vermont Public Radio on Thursday. \u201cI think as is illustrated by the thousands of documents and emails we released between Dr. Gruber and the staff, including myself, I feel confident that we\u2019ve gotten our money\u2019s worth in terms of both the amount of work as well as the quality of the work that we received.\u201d\n\nBut that explanation doesn\u2019t hold water with the senior contracts manager Breitbart News spoke with on Friday.\n\n\u201cGruber\u2019s two line bills reflect the fact that the state was not rigorous enough in its contract language to require detailed billings, and the fact that once they received the first bill, they let it go,\u201d the state contracts manager told Breitbart News. \u201cRobin Lunge asking, \u2018Gee do you think this is detailed enough\u2019 one time, and then settling for the status quo is also a dereliction of duty because she\u2019s a lawyer and should know better.\u201d\n\nIn the end, the contracts manager said, \u201cthe administration blew it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe only question is, did they do so intentionally so that not very much of the work could be tracked?,\u201d the contracts manager asked.\n\nThat may be a question on the radar of Vermont State Auditor Hoffer.\n\n\u201cContracts are a serious business. And if you agree to the terms of a contract then you have an obligation to meet those requirements, and he [Jonathan Gruber] has not met those requirements,\u201d Hoffer told Vermont Public Radio on Thursday.\n\n\u201cThe contract called for a description of the work performed. He simply says we worked these many hours. On the face of it, it does not appear to meet the terms of the contract,\u201d Hoffer added.\n\nHoffer is losing patience with Gruber\u2019s lack of responsiveness. He told Vermont Public Radio on Thursday, he\u2019s \u201casked Gruber for more detailed documentation of his work. . . Gruber\u2019s responses to those inquiries have been \u2018unsatisfactory.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAs a constitutional officer elected statewide, Hoffer has a broad authority\u2013including subpoena power\u2013to compel subjects of investigations to comply with his information requests.\n\nHoffer appears increasingly inclined to use this subpoena power to compel Gruber to respond to his information requests in the near future. But Hoffer\u2019s subpoena power is not enforceable outside the state of Vermont without the assistance of law enforcement authorities in the state in which the subpoenaed subject lives.\n\nAs a resident of Massachusetts, Gruber may try to continue his stonewalling ways and force Hoffer to request the assistance of that state\u2019s Attorney General to obtain the basic accounting documentation he seeks from Gruber.\n\nAttorney Toensing, who resides in Vermont, is unimpressed with Hoffer\u2019s investigative efforts to date.\n\n\u201cHoffer recognizes red flags with Gruber\u2019s invoices and the need for an investigation. But he then purports to launch an investigation by making \u2018requests\u2019 through an administration apparatchik with a vested interest in protecting Gruber and Governor Shumlin,\u201d Toensing told Breitbart News on Friday. \u201cIf Hoffer was serious about conducting a real investigation, he would hit Gruber with a subpoena and demand a response forthwith.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis contract involves a lot of federal money and well-publicized, highly-questionable billing practices, so I would have expected Vermont\u2019s United States Attorney\u2019s office to have launched an investigation,\u201d Toensing noted.\n\nToensing concluded by offering a comment that potential white collar crime defendants around the country dread hearing.\n\n\u201cIf they get into this, which they should, they won\u2019t make pleading requests through a conflicted, political operative. They will serve Gruber with a federal grand jury subpoena,\u201d Toensing stated.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Vermont State Auditor: Jonathan Gruber Response to Contract Investigation 'Unsatisfactory'", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Vermont State Auditor: Jonathan Gruber Response to Contract Investigation 'Unsatisfactory'", "title": "Vermont State Auditor: Jonathan Gruber Response to Contract Investigation 'Unsatisfactory' - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2014/12/jonathan-gruber-testimony-afp.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/01/23/vermont-state-auditor-jonathan-gruber-response-to-contract-investigation-unsatisfactory/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Vermont State Auditor: Jonathan Gruber Response to Contract Investigation 'Unsatisfactory'", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2014/12/jonathan-gruber-testimony-afp.jpg", "title": "Vermont State Auditor: Jonathan Gruber Response to Contract Investigation 'Unsatisfactory' - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Brady Toensing, Jonathan Gruber, obamacare, Robin Lunge, Vermont single-payer, Vermont State Auditor Doug Hoffer,Big Government, Obamacare,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "Vermont State Auditor Doug Hoffer", "published_time": "2015-01-23T08:29:59-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,Obamacare"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcaecc\"", "article_summary": "That may be a question on the radar of Vermont State Auditor Hoffer.\nOn the face of it, it does not appear to meet the terms of the contract,\u201d Hoffer added.\nAll checks under this contract with the state of Vermont have been paid to Gruber as an individual.\nWith the release of Governor Shumlin\u2019s final report on the shelved single-payer program in late December, Gruber\u2019s contract has presumably been completed.\nUnder the terms of that contract, Gruber was to be paid $500 per hour for work he performed, and $100 per hour for work performed by research assistants under his direction."}
