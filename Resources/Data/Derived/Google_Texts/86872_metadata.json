The 59-year-old construction manager at Blue Lake Rancheria could have traveled the six hours to Stanford Medical Center. He had other reservations, instead.\n\n\u201cNo, we went to France \u2013 to Toulouse France \u2013 and did it,\u201d said Ryan, chuckling at the thought. \u201cIt was great.\u201d\n\nAll kidding aside, Ryan didn\u2019t have to pay a dime for his medical tourism surgery in France \u2013 even $7,000 worth of deductibles and co-pays were waived \u2013 plus, he got to tour the Pyrenees Mountains, take in the local art scene, and sample baguettes, chateaux, Truffles and other French indulgences.\n\n\u201cThe food in Toulouse was out-of-this-world,\u201d said Ryan. \u201cWe ate like royalty. I\u2019ll tell you.\u201d\n\nHis employer, the Blue Lake Rancheria tribe which operates the casino and hotel in Northern California, covered all costs; yet, saved about $12,000, roughly 35 percent of what the surgery would have cost in the United States. On top of that, 10 percent of the company\u2019s savings went directly into Ryan\u2019s 401k plan.\n\nJack Norton, the human resource manager at Blue Lake Rancheria, was introduced to medical tourism opportunities and France Surgery at the World Medical Tourism & Global Healthcare Congress.\n\nJack Norton, the human resources manager at Blue Lake Rancheria, said the company\u2019s self-funded insurance plan includes a medical tourism option that enables employees to travel overseas for procedures and treatments.\n\nDespite the Affordable Care Act, U.S. employers like Blue Lake Rancheria have struggled to control spiraling healthcare costs and understand complex provisions of the new legislation. A few years ago, Blue Lake Rancheria made the move to self-fund employee healthcare benefits. The decision to incorporate medical tourism was a no- brainer.\n\n\u201cWe (United States) do have high-quality care, but then also \u2013 at the same time \u2013 we also have the most expensive care in the world,\u201d said Norton, who had been introduced to health travel at the World Medical Tourism & Global Healthcare Congress.\n\nIt was at the Congress, last year, in Las Vegas, that Norton formed his \u201cFrench Connection, with France Surgery, a member of the Medical Tourism Association\u00ae with links to 120 hospitals and more than 1,500 specialists across France, which handled logistics for Ryan\u2019s surgery including two round- trip tickets on Lufthansa Airlines and 21-day hotel accommodations, admission to a Clinique de l\u2019Union \u2014 a private 531-bed, surgical and obstetric clinic in Toulouse \u2014 sightseeing tours and after care.\n\n\u201cWhen people think of medical tourism, most think of Latin America because it is inexpensive,\u201d said Carine Hilaire, an operations manager at France Surgery. \u201cBut, that\u2019s changing. France is very affordable and the level of healthcare services is very high. People just don\u2019t realize it \u2014 yet.\u201d\n\nBruce Ryan, a construction manager at Blue Lake Rancheria, is resting comfortable with his decision to undergo rotator cuff surgery in France.\n\nRen\u00e9e-Marie Stephano, President of the Medical Tourism Association\u00ae, said self-funding employers looking to save anywhere from 10 percent to 75 percent on elective surgeries, from hip and knee replacements to cataract removal and heart bypass, can take a clue from Blue Lake Rancheria and attend the 7th World Medical Tourism & Global Healthcare Congress, Sept. 20-24, 2014, in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe Congress annually attracts more than 3,000 hospital administrators, doctors and clinicians, employers and human resource managers, medical tourism facilitators, insurance executives, government policymakers, and hospitality and travel interests with a common thought in mind: connecting quality and affordable treatments to solve healthcare challenges without compromising anyone\u2019s bottom line.\n\n\u201cElevated quality and successful outcomes, price value, and travel experiences to France, don\u2019t come without some homework,\u201d said Stephano. \u201cAmerican hospitals should take notice: there\u2019s now high quality competition for U.S. patients and shrinking healthcare dollars.\u201d\n\nAs for Ryan and Blue Lake Rancheria, both patient and employer are resting comfortable with their decision.\n\n\u201cIt amazes me that the United States could be so medieval in its healthcare,\u201d said Ryan, who is back on the job. \u201cSurgery, both quality and experience, were exceptional. Cost of course was unbelievable compared to what I would have had in terms of co-payments in the United States.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Self-funding U.S. employers -- like Blue Lake Rancheria -- are managing healthcare costs by offering medical tourism to employees in their benefit plans.", "og": {"url": "http://www.medicaltourismmag.com/blog/2014/07/medical-tourism-piece-de-resistance-self-funding-u-s-employers/", "type": "article", "image": "http://www.medicaltourismmag.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/France_Medical_Tourism_CBS.png", "site_name": "Medical Tourism Magazine | Blog", "title": "Medical Tourism: Pi\u00e8ce de R\u00e9sistance for Self-Funding U.S. Employers"}, "twitter": {"description": "Self-funding U.S. employers -- like Blue Lake Rancheria -- are managing healthcare costs by offering medical tourism to employees in their benefit plans.", "title": "Medical Tourism: Pi\u00e8ce de R\u00e9sistance for Self-Funding U.S. Employers", "image": "http://www.medicaltourismmag.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/France_Medical_Tourism_CBS.png", "creator": "@Medtour", "site": "@MedTourMagazine", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 578485882245508}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdee28\"", "article_summary": "Jack Norton, the human resource manager at Blue Lake Rancheria, was introduced to medical tourism opportunities and France Surgery at the World Medical Tourism & Global Healthcare Congress.\nThe 59-year-old construction manager at Blue Lake Rancheria could have traveled the six hours to Stanford Medical Center.\n\u201cWhen people think of medical tourism, most think of Latin America because it is inexpensive,\u201d said Carine Hilaire, an operations manager at France Surgery.\nThe decision to incorporate medical tourism was a no- brainer.\nDespite the Affordable Care Act, U.S. employers like Blue Lake Rancheria have struggled to control spiraling healthcare costs and understand complex provisions of the new legislation."}
