Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson took a different approach. In a Rolling Stone article, Wilson claims his speedy recovery from a head injury last year was the result of drinking Reliant Recovery Water. #Nanobubbles.\n\n\"I banged my head during the Packers game in the playoffs, and the next day I was fine,\u201d Wilson told Rolling Stone. \"It was the water.\"\n\nI will give it to Wilson. Following a brutal collision with Green Bay Packers linebacker Clay Matthews, the Super Bowl winning quarterback did make a seemingly miraculous recovery. Although Wilson did not go through the league\u2019s concussion protocols, he did return to the next series to lead his team to a win in that NFC Championship Game.\n\nI believe @Recovery_Water helped prevent me from getting a concussion based on a bad hit! _ #NanoBubbles \u2014 Russell Wilson (@DangeRussWilson) August 26, 2015\n\nDespite Wilson\u2019s blessing, I have a hard time believing a $3 bottle of water that has \u201cno added ingredients other than minerals for enhanced electrolytes\u201d prevented his concussion \u2014 mainly due to science, but also because Wilson is an investor in Recovery Water.\n\nWilson doubled down on his outlandish claim with the above tweet and then tripled down with another tweet linking to an article from December 2014, showing that the company responsible for \u201cnanobubbles\u201d is still in its early research stages.\n\nIntriguing... http://t.co/Qn3WmfY0nH \u2014 Russell Wilson (@DangeRussWilson) August 27, 2015\n\nSo what do you think? Is this just a not-so-subtle marketing ploy or is Wilson officially off the reservation?", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "seattle, seahawks, quarterback, russell, wilson, claims, recovery, water, helped, him, avoid", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson praises Reliant Recovery Water for preventing a concussion last season.", "title": "Is Russell Wilson's Claim Water Prevents Concussions Really Just A Marketing Ploy?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/seattle-seahawks-quarterback-russell-wilson-claims-recovery-water-helped-him-avoid-350054", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2015/08/27/recovery-water.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson praises Reliant Recovery Water for preventing a concussion last season.", "title": "Is Russell Wilson's Claim Water Prevents Concussions Really Just A Marketing Ploy?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/seattle-seahawks-quarterback-russell-wilson-claims-recovery-water-helped-him-avoid-350054", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2015/08/27/recovery-water.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/08/27/recovery-water.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-08-27T17:00:29-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-27T17:00:28-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson praises Reliant Recovery Water for preventing a concussion last season."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1cc5\"", "article_summary": "Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson took a different approach.\nIn a Rolling Stone article, Wilson claims his speedy recovery from a head injury last year was the result of drinking Reliant Recovery Water.\nIntriguing... http://t.co/Qn3WmfY0nH \u2014 Russell Wilson (@DangeRussWilson) August 27, 2015So what do you think?\n\"I banged my head during the Packers game in the playoffs, and the next day I was fine,\u201d Wilson told Rolling Stone.\nFollowing a brutal collision with Green Bay Packers linebacker Clay Matthews, the Super Bowl winning quarterback did make a seemingly miraculous recovery."}
