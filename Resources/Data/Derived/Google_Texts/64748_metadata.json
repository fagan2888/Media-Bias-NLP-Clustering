Bobby Jindal says that President Obama made the \u201cmoral case for socialism\u201d during a speech Tuesday in which the president defended his health care law.\n\nThe president spoke before Catholic Health Association on Tuesday where he argued that Obamacare was entrenched in the \u201cfabric\u201d of American society and could not be repealed.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s call his remarks exactly what they are,\u201d Jindal on Wednesday told radio host Mike Gallagher. \u201cHe made the moral case for socialism. Let\u2019s not sugarcoat it, that\u2019s exactly what he believes. He doesn\u2019t hide it, he doesn\u2019t pretend, we shouldn\u2019t either. This isn\u2019t new. Those who favor socialism always make the moral case for it.\u201d\n\nJindal added, \u201cin the real word, socialism harms.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe truth is, maybe they actually believe in it, but in the real world, socialism harms, it weakens the economies of countries that have tried it. It just does,\u201d he said. \u201cWeaker economies hurt everybody in them. Socialism kills incentive, opportunity, freedom. It is the opposite of what America is all about. Look, socialism always harms the people it claims to help the most. It handicaps them, leaving them weaker, less self-determined, less free. We should have this debate out in the open.\u201d\n\nThe Louisiana governor, who is expected to announce his presidential candidacy in the coming weeks, said he believes the president\u2019s \u201cmoral case\u201d for the health care law was \u201cactually immoral.\u201d Jindal said the president lied to the American people and the law was fiscally irresponsible.\n\n\u201cHis \u2018moral case\u2019 for Obamacare is actually immoral. Spending money you don\u2019t have is immoral. Borrowing more money than you can pay back is immoral. Lying to the American people is immoral, so it\u2019s ironic he chooses to use the terms \u2018moral case\u2019 or \u2018moral imperative\u2019 to make the case for what I think is a very flawed law. The Supreme Court, I hope, rules the correct way. We need to repeal this, replace this. Mike, we cannot measure success by how many people are dependent on government. That\u2019s what President Obama wants. That is the opposite of what America stands for.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"He doesn't hide it, he doesn't pretend, we shouldn't either.
