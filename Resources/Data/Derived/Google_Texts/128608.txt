Republican Gov. Sam Brownback's push for an investigation into whether tissue from aborted fetuses is being sold commercially is the latest episode in a long history of moves against Planned Parenthood by Kansas abortion opponents.

That history includes investigations by prosecutors and a grand jury. The group's clinic in the Kansas City suburb of Overland Park has never faced criminal trial.

Legislators also have prevented federal funds from flowing through the state to Planned Parenthood.

Brownback called for a Kansas medical board investigation after anti-abortion activists released two secretly recorded videos of Planned Parenthood officials outside Kansas discussing how fetal tissue is provided for research.

The group's Kansas and Mid-Missouri affiliate sees the latest investigation as harassment.

The anti-abortion group Kansans for Life contends Planned Parenthood warrants the scrutiny.
