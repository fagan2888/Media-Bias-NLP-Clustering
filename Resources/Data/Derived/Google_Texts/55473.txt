Charles Krauthammer was on “The O’Reilly Factor,” where he weighed in on ObamaCare architect Jonathan Gruber’s remarks that a “lack of transparency” and the “stupidity of the American voter” helped pass the health care law.

“This is exactly what conservatives have been saying for four years, what we’re gearing now is the true voice of liberal arrogance,” Krauthammer said, adding that such people believe that voters are stupid.

“They believe that they know the right way, they have to lead the masses to the promise land and they can only do it by deception,” he said.

Both O’Reilly and Krauthammer agreed that ObamaCare won’t last.

Krauthammer then touched on Obama’s gum-chewing gaffe in China, which had some Chinese residents upset.

He said that the Chinese have been extremely sensitive to the rituals and decorum of diplomacy. In China, chewing gum is a sign of disrespect, so if you’re the president of the United States, you shouldn’t be chewing gum as you step out of your limo.
