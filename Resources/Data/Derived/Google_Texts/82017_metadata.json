It was extremely exciting to be able to tell people who stayed up very, very late in the evening that their efforts had paid off.\n\nIn subsequent posts, we have been happy to tell you about other wins that were not official on November 4. On Thursday we wrote about National Right to Life-endorsed retired Air Force Col. Martha McSally (R) who defeated pro-abortion Rep. Ron Barber (D) by less than one-thousandth of a percent! Previously we\u2019d updated you on the victory by pro-life Dan Sullivan (R) in Alaska over pro-abortion incumbent Mark Begich (D) and the solid victory by pro-life Rep. Bill Cassidy (R) over pro-abortion Sen. Mary Landrieu (D) in a December 6 runoff in Louisiana.\n\nBesides privately licking their wounds, pro-abortionists have publicly announced what you\u2019d expect: The abortion issue played no role in making possible a net gain of nine Republicans in the Senate or enabling Republicans to have the most GOP members in the House (247) since 1928.\n\nWe know better.\n\nFor details on all that NRL\u2019s political entities did, let me direct you to nrlc.cc/1z9a90Q; nrlc.cc/1z9a39l; and www.nrlc.org/uploads/NRLNews/NRLNewsDec2014.pdf. Here are just three quick concluding thoughts.\n\nBut if you want to see the results portrayed all in one place and easy to read, go to www.nrlc.org/electionhq.\n\n#1. NRL PAC and NRL Victory Fund were, as always, greatly outspent by the likes of EMILY\u2019s Lists and the Planned Parenthood Action Fund. Also, as always, our resources were used wisely, at just the right time in just the right locations to help carry vulnerable office-seekers over the finish line. Credit goes to everyone whose financial contributions helped make this shrewd use of resources possible.\n\n#2. The win by Col. McSally illustrates the manner in which NRL\u2019s political entities went all out. To quote NRL Political Director Karen Cross\n\nIndependently, approximately 25,000 identified voter households were contacted, and 275 radio ads were aired on seven stations in Arizona\u2019s second congressional district, exposing the vast difference on life issues between the candidates, including their positions on the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, the use of tax dollars to pay for abortion, and the pro-abortion, pro-rationing Obamacare law.\n\nAnd, of course, that is independent of the \u201csweat equity\u201d so many pro-lifers put into helping educate the public about the views of the candidates on the life issues. That input was absolutely essential. And\u2026\n\n#3. You are no doubt familiar with the following numbers, but they should remain firmly in mind. Why? Because in so many contests, they illustrate that once again David\u2014NRL\u2019s political entities\u2014defeated Goliath.\n\nNational Right to Life endorsed 287 federal candidates. A whopping 90% won their elections\u2014including Col. McSally\u2019s victory.\n\nWe were actively focused on 74 of the most competitive federal races: 18 for seats in the U.S. Senate, and 56 for seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. National Right to Life-supported candidates won 76% of their elections.\n\nWhat about the abortion lobby? National Right to Life was involved in 26 head-to-head races against the major pro-abortion PAC, EMILY\u2019s List. Of those, 19 (73%) of the NRL-endorsed candidates won their elections, despite a substantial financial disparity.\n\nFinally, the abortion issue did matter! Twenty-three percent of voters across the nation said that the abortion issue affected their vote and voted for candidates who oppose abortion. Just 16% said abortion affected their vote and voted for candidates who favor abortion.\n\nThis 7% net gain for pro-life candidates made the difference not just in Col. McSally\u2019s victory but also in many races. As a consequence, as Karen Cross wrote yesterday, \u201cThese pro-life successes mean that pro-life leadership will preside over both houses in Congress in 2015, when the 114th Congress convenes.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://www.nationalrighttolifenews.org/news/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Elections_Matter_2-231x300.jpg"}, "bitly-verification": "3d313669c834"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfe94\"", "article_summary": "Of those, 19 (73%) of the NRL-endorsed candidates won their elections, despite a substantial financial disparity.\nThis 7% net gain for pro-life candidates made the difference not just in Col.
