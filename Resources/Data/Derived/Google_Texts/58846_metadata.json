The margin of error is plus or minus four percentage points.\n\nThe largest share \u2014 about a quarter of those surveyed \u2014 gained it through the expansion of Medi-Cal, California's Medicaid program. About 12 percent report now having insurance through an employer, while 14 percent say they're covered by individual policies (9 percent of which were bought on the state's health insurance marketplace, Covered California \u2014 the remaining 5 percent purchased unsubsidized insurance outside the marketplace).\n\n\"That leaves 42 percent still uninsured,\" says Mollyann Brodie, Kaiser Foundation senior vice president and executive director of the foundation's public opinion and survey research. \"For the first time we can shed some light on what made them likely to get insurance and what didn't and what some of the challenges are going to be in the second round of open enrollment.\"\n\nThe survey found more Latinos enrollment than many had expected, with 61 percent of eligible Latinos gaining health coverage. That matched the signup rates for uninsured whites and blacks.\n\nIt also found a 58 percent increase in coverage among formerly uninsured 19-to 34-year-olds surveyed.\n\nNot all of the remaining uninsured can get health coverage. Those in the U.S. illegally are ineligible.\n\nFor those who are eligible, advocates are focusing on how to encourage them to get it.\n\nBrodie says most of the \"still-uninsured\" cited cost as among the most significant barriers to coverage. Yet, she says, six out of ten are actually eligible for financial assistance.\n\n\"The real message has to be financial help is available so they can really understand that their perceived barrier of cost and affordability might not be such a barrier,\" she says.\n\nOther hurdles cited by the still uninsured respondents: difficulty in finding information about signing up for insurance and difficulty in shopping for and comparing plans.\n\nWere you able to get health insurance under the Affordable Care Act?
