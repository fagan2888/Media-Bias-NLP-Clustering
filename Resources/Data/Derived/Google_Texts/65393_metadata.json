One guy was waving around a huge knife. They took us into the woods and made us strip topless, and gave us a swastika poster to hold. Now they will kill us for sure, I thought.\u201d\n\nTwo years ago today, Femen\u2014the Ukrainian-born protest movement that has since become one of the world\u2019s most provocative activist groups through its topless demonstrations and campaign for a militant feminism \u2014orchestrated one of its most daring early protests, sneaking into Belarus in an attempt to embarrass the Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, Europe\u2019s final dictator. In an excerpt from his new Atlantic ebook, Topless Jihadis, an exclusive account of life inside Femen, the magazine\u2019s longtime Russia correspondent Jeffrey Tayler shares the dramatic story of that formative first mission and the ensuing escape. In the winter of 2011, Inna Shevchenko, the 22-year-old Ukrainian activist who would soon catapult the protest movement Femen\u2014the self-described \u201cshock-troops of feminism\u201d and \u201cthe watch-bitches of democracy\u201d\u2014to international notoriety, began hatching a plan.\n\nShe and her Femen colleagues in their burgeoning battle against sexism and female oppression, decided to hit a truly hard target: the regime of Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, Europe\u2019s last dictator. \u201cWe spent two evenings talking over things in Caf\u00e9 Kupidon, which was our office back then. We were pretty inexperienced, but we did know it would be dangerous.\u201d Getting into Belarus would be the first problem. Inna Shevchenko, Oksana Shachko, and Sasha Nemchinova took an all-night train to Bryansk, in Russia, to avoid the border post between Ukraine and Belarus. (The border between Russia and Belarus is open, with no checkpoints.) Femen had already won a measure of notoriety, and the women didn\u2019t want to be turned back at the frontier, Shevchenko told me. \u201cTen guys in black tracksuits, with walkie-talkie earbuds, surrounded us.\u201d \u201cWe got to Bryansk in the middle of the night and caught a bus to Minsk. We arrived at 4 in the morning, and rented a room in the bus station. We were nervous, and I couldn\u2019t sleep. We woke up and called our contact, but as soon as she heard our voices, she said, \u2018Say no more!\u2019 and told us to meet her by the theater.\u201d Shevchenko\u2019s voice drifted, her glance diverted. I pictured the scene: the three young women, embarking on a mission that could cost them their liberty, if not their lives, riding on a cold, dark, creaking train north from Kiev through the snow-blanketed forests, the sky starless and black. Then catching a rickety, Soviet-era bus trundling down an icy, potholed highway toward Minsk, a city festooned with portraits of Lukashenko presiding over drab gray boulevards, spottily lit by streetlamps. A dingy room in the bus station. \u201cWe took a cab to the theater. It was bizarre: the streets were empty and silent. It\u2019s the capital, but it looks like a ghost town. The KGB headquarters was on a quiet, wide street, with no one around,\u201d Shevchenko said. \u201cWe quickly undressed, raised our posters, and started shouting our slogans.\u201d Only one video survived the KGB raid that soon followed. It shows the three women in fake, bushy Lukashenko mustaches, with Shevchenko and Shachko coiffed in floral crowns. Nemchinova\u2019s head was shaved to confer on her the president\u2019s male-pattern baldness, her shoulders bearing Lukashenko-style epaulettes, her back painted with the dictator\u2019s portrait, and a communist red star emblazoned between her pendulous breasts. They chanted only one slogan, \u201cZhyve Belarus!\u201d (\u201cLong live Belarus!\u201d), their posters inscribed with that and FREEDOM TO POLITICAL PRISONERS! The video that made it out \u201cwas shot,\u201d Shevchenko said, \u201cby a journalist who came up, stopped and taped, and walked on.\u201d\n\nBizarrely, no one arrested the activists. \u201cWe grabbed our coats and got dressed and ran like mad. We turned into the courtyards and ran down alleys,\u201d Shevchenko said. \u201cThey kept telling us, \u2018Now, bitches, you\u2019ll find out what it means to come to Belarus and destroy our national unity!\u2019\u201d \u201cOur Belarusian contact kept hurrying us, \u2018Hurry up! Hurry up! You\u2019ve got to get to the bus station fast!\u2019 At that moment, we saw a man in a black raincoat and black hat, sitting alone on a bench nearby. He got up and came along and passed us, talking on his phone. For a minute I thought, We\u2019re arrested! But no. We started to relax. It was true, we\u2019d succeeded and we were now going to get away. But then at the bus station we saw a second man in a black coat and hat. He came along and stood by us as we picked up our tickets. But he didn\u2019t do anything. He pretended to be reading a sign next to us.\u201d They left the man in black and hurried out to the bus. As they were about to board, it all began. \u201cTen guys in black tracksuits, with walkie-talkie earbuds, surrounded us,\u201d Shevchenko recounted. \u201cThen two of them grabbed me and clamped their hands over my mouth. People around us turned away, pretending not to see anything\u2014they are that afraid of the KGB there. The men dragged us over to a gray van, with no windows, and shoved us inside, with an officer sitting on each side of us so we couldn\u2019t move. There were a total of six cars with our minivan, and we peeled out at high speed.\u201d The activists demanded to know who these men were, but they refused to respond. One of them grabbed Shevchenko\u2019s mobile phone and started scrolling through her messages. \u201cThe men asked us who we were and why we were here. We told them the truth, since they knew anyway. \u2018With us you need to be careful,\u2019 one of our captors kept saying,\u201d Shevchenko told me. She asked in vain to be turned over to the police. \u201cThey kept telling us, \u2018Now, bitches, you\u2019ll find out what it means to come to Belarus and destroy our national unity!\u2019 They pulled my hands behind my back and put plastic handcuffs on me. They made us sit in the van with our heads bent down between our knees. Every time I raised my head, they hit me. Everything swelled in me from the cramped position. I never had to go to the bathroom, but Oksana did, so they took her outside and she squatted down and went, like a dog on a leash. We drove for about five hours, always hunched over.\n\n\u201cIt was unbearable,\u201d she remembered. \u201cThey kept telling us, \u2018Remember your mothers\u2019 faces and how happy they were when they saw you. And now imagine them when they see your dead bodies.\u2019 Otherwise there was total silence. It was eerie. They didn\u2019t talk to each other, not a word. They were professionally trained.\u201d Finally, late in the afternoon, the vehicle stopped. \u201cI thought, Now they\u2019re going to kill us,\u201d Shevchenko said. \u201cThey made us get out. They all had masks on. One guy was waving around a huge knife. They took us into the woods and made us strip topless, and gave us a swastika poster to hold. Now they will kill us for sure, I thought.\u201d \u201c\u2018Remember your mothers\u2019 faces and how happy they were when they saw you. And now imagine them when they see your dead bodies.\u2019\u201d The men took pictures of the women with the Nazi emblem and then threatened to kill them. \u201cThen one said, \u2018Take off your pants and panties, and turn around and face away from us. And bend over.\u2019 Now they\u2019ll rape us, I thought. We waited three minutes like that, but they didn\u2019t rape us,\u201d she told me. \u201c\u2018Dress by the count of three!\u2019 he then shouted. \u2018Strip by the count of three, or you will be killed!\u2019 We kept dressing and undressing. They beat us if we couldn\u2019t keep up. Then they came over to us with some sort of bucket and poured something over our faces. It was green paint, some sort of oil, and then they dropped feathers all over us. One guy grabbed me and shoved me to the ground. He held me down and waved his big knife over me. He grabbed my hair and yanked, and cut it off with the knife.\u201d The women were dragged back to the van and forced inside for a trip that didn\u2019t last long. The men pushed the women out into the frigid dusk. Shevchenko remembers that the driver was an older man\u2014she could tell by his eyes, through his ski mask. He pointed into the forest and said, \u201cUkraine\u2019s that way. Just keep to the right.\u201d \u201cWe walked into the woods,\u201d Shevchenko said. \u201cWhen we heard them drive away, we started running.\u201d\n\nThe women crashed and stumbled through the snow banks, tripping over downed tree trunks and fallen branches, and discovered they were in a frozen bog. On and on they plodded. Night was falling and they were alone, now deep among the trees. \u201cWe finally came to a river and saw a man on the other side. He shouted to us and asked who we were. But suddenly he just hurried away. We wandered for another hour, but ended up circling right around to where we\u2019d started. It started to snow. We got really scared.\u201d In the gathering dark, they heard the staccato roar of chainsaws. Three men soon walked out of the forest. \u201cI ran up to them. But I was covered with green paint and feathers. They looked startled, even afraid of us. They told us their village was about 10 kilometers away. Then they disappeared.\u201d The activists marched on, having almost lost hope of finding the border with Ukraine, ever more fearful in the night. But then a man came bouncing along atop a tractor. Shevchenko pulled out the $100 bill she had stuffed in her sock for emergencies. \u201cI offered it to him, but he wouldn\u2019t take us anywhere. He couldn\u2019t understand what I wanted! I kept shouting \u2018Take us to the village for this money!\u2019 He spoke half-swallowing his words. He was so uneducated, we could hardly understand him. He just refused to help and drove on.\u201d After a couple of hours of stumbling down the road, they reached the village of Beki. An old man invited them into his cabin, gave them tea and sweaters, and let them take off their wet clothes and dry them on his stove. \u201cI felt safe for first time,\u201d said Shevchenko, who called Anna Hutsol and told her where they were. \u201cThe old man fed us macaroni and fried onions, and he led us to two beds in a side room. I slept in one with Oksana. Oksana kept crying, saying, \u2018We have to leave! I\u2019m leaving or they\u2019ll come for us!\u2019 But I said, \u2018No, we can\u2019t go out into woods at night. If we do, they can kill us there and no one would know.\u2019 She threatened to go alone.\u201d \u201cA huge man, a lumberjack, who was drunk and angry, burst into our room and threw himself on us, groping us and wanting to have sex.\u201d Then things took a turn for the worse. \u201cA huge man, a lumberjack, who was drunk and angry, burst into our room and threw himself on us, groping us and wanting to have sex. We kept pushing him off, and he kept returning, pawing at us. He was trying to rape us. The old man came back in and shouted at him to stop and made him leave,\u201d Shevchenko said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u201cThey all had masks on.
