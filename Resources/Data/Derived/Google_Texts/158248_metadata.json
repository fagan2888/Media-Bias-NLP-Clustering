There\u2019s no middle ground. Depending on your views (or the degree of apathy), it\u2019s either consummate evil or merely the reality of politics. Depending on the size of your pocketbook, it\u2019s either predatory capitalism or a smart business decision.\n\nThe gang of immoral corporatists and their political vassals in Washington and state legislatures continue to do what they do best: Hold children, sick people, the elderly (anyone who can\u2019t fight back) and the citizens of entire nations hostage, demanding they surrender and accept their demands.\n\nA Wall Street hedge fund multi-millionaire named Martin Shkreli, who recently bragged on Twitter about spending $9,000 on a single bottle of wine, started a company that bought the rights to a medicine called Daraprim. The company then raised the price from $13.50 per pill to $750 per pill. Shkreli had the nerve to go on CBS News and say, \u201c\u2026.it\u2019s a reasonable profit. Not excessive at all.\u201d\n\nThe GOP holds our nation for ransom as they threaten to shut down our country over the funding of Planned Parenthood, when doing so will cost more tax dollars than leaving it alone. And regardless of what Carly the Horrible said, there is no video of a fully gestated baby about to have its brain harvested.\n\nThe truth is this: They don\u2019t care about this, it\u2019s merely click bait for attention, a political love song whose purpose is to seduce their electorate into loosening the strings of their wallets. \u201cI'm one of you, but I need money to be elected!\"\n\nHad it not been for Judge Tim Sulak, thousands of disabled Texas children would be without therapy service because of the state budget cuts, while at the same time, Texas legislators were handing out millions to their corporate overlords who fund their re-election.\n\nBut after all, we shouldn\u2019t hold up Texas as a model of logical thought, it\u2019s the only place in America where you can have a gun, but not a homemade clock.\n\nTed Cruz, the ultimate Darth Vader of politics, corrupts youth by putting a child on the Cruz\u2019 SuperPac payroll. His newest hired hand is little man, C.J. Pearson, who blurts out blatant lies to the media and broadcasts videos disrespecting the President. It's oddly reminiscent of Gary Coleman, sans Willis.\n\nIf this is the GOP\u2019s best attempt at minority outreach, we\u2019re not biting.\n\nYou can tell a lot about those who use impressionable young people as a human shield, to act as their personal pitbull, to do their dirty work for them and thus, maintain the illusion that Calgary Ted\u2019s hands are saintly and clean.\n\nAt the Value Voters summit, he alluded to killing the Ayatollah and putting Obama in prison on his first day in office. It\u2019s no wonder that last year, the police found Heidi Cruz crying on the grassy area by a busy freeway in Houston.\n\nLike cold water to a weary thirsty soul in the desert, came El Papa. It was an opportune moment. We needed his words, his scolding, and his admonitions.\n\nHe made the humanists of America realize they were not overly idealistic or crazy, after all. Of course, Republicans, who ALWAYS want to inject religion into everything, didn\u2019t think so. Predictably, they clutched their pearls and gasped. Many were outraged at his visit, announcing they were boycotting his speeches, publicly proclaiming it was injecting religion into politics.\n\nThe Pope\u2019s visit and his humble request, \u201cPray for me \u201c, was a moral epiphany, a Paul-on-the-road-to-Damascus-moment, for one man. Read Robert Costa\u2019s extremely moving piece about John Boehner after the Pope\u2019s visit. Beware, you may need tissues.\n\nThere were many dancing on Boehner\u2019s grave on Friday morning, after he made his resignation announcement, not realizing what kind of hateful devils will ascend to the stage now.\n\nIt seems as if there is nothing that politicians and corporatists won\u2019t say or do to fill their wallets or shore up their fragile sense of self.\n\nChildren are no longer off-limits. The elderly are not off-limits. Religion's not off limits, either.\n\nBanker/realtors everywhere will invoke the Bible to make a favorable impression on their unwary victims.\n\nTexas steals the future of young people by limiting their access to a college education and forces seniors to live without dignity as they wait for death, the ultimate escape from their humiliation of begging for food, medicine and perhaps, some companionship.\n\nIt falls on deaf ears, however.\n\nThose who worship the god of capitalism even employ their own offspring as props, cast, and cameo appearances for their political theater, and to ensure the future of their family financial dynasties.\n\nOn the right, there\u2019s nothing that\u2019s sacred; the most acceptable substitution is the religious rhetoric that, at some level, everyone, even their supporters, knows is a lie.\n\nMove over Dick Cheney, you\u2019ve been usurped by a new generation.\n\nGod help us all.\n\nAnd I mean that with the greatest of sincerity.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCarol Morgan is a career/college counselor, a freelance writer, and former Democratic candidate for the Texas House.
