Real believers take the Fox News \u201cWar on Christmas\u201d talking point seriously. Some, such as evangelical brand specialist Chris Stone, are acting on it.\n\nStone\u2014the founder of Faith Driven Global\u2014launched a Christian retail index earlier this year, which seeks to harness the $30 billion in Christmas buying power of the nation\u2019s \u201cBiblically Orthodox Christians.\u201d\n\nAs Stone sees it: \u201cToday\u2019s marketplace is tribalized.\u201d\n\nStone\u2019s base of evangelical BOCs are already almost as tribal as the Williamsburg Lubavitchers. The BOCs have their own Boy Scouts (Trail Life U.S.A.), Girl Scouts (American Heritage Girls), and their own Liberty University. They even read their own newspapers, like the dreary, tendentious Washington Examiner, where Stone announced his 2015 \u201cChristmasBuycott\u201d\u2014complete with a hashtag, of course.\n\nA \u201cbuycott\u201d is the flip side of a \u201cboycott.\u201d It guides faithful consumers toward Christian-friendly retail outlets, while ranking the places they can avoid by spending their money with merchants who share their biblical worldview. I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s a difference, but Stone argues that a buycott is not as negative as a boycott. Informing these buycott consumers is Stone\u2019s Faith Equality Index\u2014a ranking of \u201chow well brands acknowledge Faith Driven Consumers (FDCs) by welcoming, embracing, and celebrating them.\u201d\n\nStone\u2019s Index draws heavily on the Human Rights Campaign\u2019s \u201chugely successful\u201d Corporate Equality Index, which ranks brands, workplaces, and retail outlets by policies and practices regarding the LGBTQ community\u2014and has even been \u201clargely successful in compelling brands to include transgender transition in health coverage.\u201d The Faith Equality Index site even compares HRC rankings with each product or outlet it ranks\u2014a subtle \u201cbuy here or buy queer\u201d message.\n\nThe Index includes a leaderboard where a consumer can track the FDC-plus points earned by reaching out to brands and recruiting family and friends. The real-time competition invites FDCs to engage in a mercantile evangelical movement that rewards the faithful and punishes the not-so-faith-friendly retailers.\n\nStarbucks was an early buycott target. Like Trump, Stone came down hard on Starbucks after it replaced its traditional \u201cChristian-themed\u201d cups with a \u201csolid red blank canvas design.\u201d\n\nStone\u2019s Index directed believers looking for a more Christ-centered cup of coffee to Dunkin\u2019 Donuts, which honors the faith by serving coffee in red cups emblazoned with the word \u201cJoy.\u201d Krispy Kreme donuts is offered up as another option.\n\nHere\u2019s the FEI as pitched in one of its promotional e-mails.
