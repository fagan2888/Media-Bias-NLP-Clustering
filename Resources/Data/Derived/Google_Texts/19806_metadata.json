Hairdressers 50 years ago in downtown Washington and moved it to increasingly trendy Bloomingdale in 1988. For much of the past quarter-century, the store in the 100 block of Rhode Island Avenue NW has been surrounded by a laundromat, a uniform business and liquor stores with Plexiglas windows.\n\nNow, it\u2019s nestled between a pub with an extensive whiskey and scotch menu, a gourmet bakery and a Mexican restaurant that sells cucumber margaritas.\n\n\u201cI want people in the community to know, especially young people, that the community is filled with people who have and people who don\u2019t have,\u201d Jackson-Martin said. \u201cI want people to know that we put up a fight to stay where we are, but we are in the \u2018has not\u2019 \u2026 I can\u2019t afford to pay double the rent like the other folks.\u201d\n\nRent throughout Bloomingdale\u2019s Zip code, 20001, has skyrocketed, and some homes have tripled in value over the past decade. The area has gone from 6 percent white in 2000 to 33 percent white in 2010, according to census data.\n\nIn 2013, the median household income for the Zip code, which also covers parts of Shaw and downtown, was $78,848 - compared with $65,830 for the city. That compares to $25,095 in 2000.\n\nStatistics such as those have made survival tough for some District mom-and-pop shops like Jak & Co., which has a loyal African American customer base.\n\nBetween 1998 and 2012, the number of District businesses with five to nine employees decreased 24 percent, according to census data compiled by the District\u2019s Office of the Chief Financial Officer.\n\nDuring that same period, stores with 250 or more employees increased 50 percent, a rate that far outpaced the 20 percent increase nationwide.\n\nJackson-Martin took over her father\u2019s shop when he died five years ago and has been on a month-to-month lease with the property\u2019s longtime owner, 104 Rhode Island Avenue Associates LLC. She wouldn\u2019t say what she pays in monthly rent but noted that it\u2019s about half of what newer establishments around her are charged.\n\nNow, Jackson-Martin said the property owners want to charge a market rate, an amount she can\u2019t afford. She doesn\u2019t want to raise prices for her customers, who pay about $35 for a haircut.\n\nRecords at the District of Columbia Landlord and Tenant Branch indicate that an eviction receipt was processed in March. Jackson-Martin plans to leave by the end of this month, and she is selling and donating the salon\u2019s equipment and working with its hairdressers - many of whom have been there for decades - to help them find new jobs.\n\n\u201cAt one point, we were the only business here, and now that the street is full, we get the eviction letter. It really hurts,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m trying to look at it as, it\u2019s just business at the end of the day, and it is just business.\u201d\n\nThe property owner and the company that manages the property, Demers Real Estate, declined to comment.\n\nSmall stores with fewer than 20 employees compose about 85 percent of retail in the District, and many establishments have been able to adapt in these changing communities.\n\nWhen Windows Cafe & Market - a corner store in the heart of Bloomingdale - opened in 2001, it mostly sold beer and chips behind a window. Now the glass is long gone, and the shelves are stocked with such items as organic frozen pizzas, hummus and an extensive craft beer selection.\n\nSara Fatell, owner of Grassroots Gourmet - a small 2\u00bd -year-old independent bakery on the same block as Jak & Co. - said the salon\u2019s longtime employees and customers often visit her shop for coffee or baked goods while they are getting their hair done.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sad to see some of the older businesses go,\u201d Fatell said. \u201cWe know them, it\u2019s a community. \u2026 It\u2019s good to have someone there before you to tell you how it\u2019s been.\u201d\n\nJackson-Martin says she and her family have no plans to relocate the salon. She briefly looked at properties along Georgia Avenue NW, but that area was also too expensive.\n\nShe\u2019s trying to figure out how to honor her father\u2019s legacy once his namesake salon is closed. She said he contributed much to the Bloomingdale community, and she would like to see a street named after him.\n\n\u201cSome good things must come to an end,\u201d she said. \u201cIt served my dad\u2019s purpose to feed his family and help the community as best he could.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Washington Post, http://www.washingtonpost.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "District of Columbia native Latosha Jackson-Martin wants the sign she posted outside her father's 50-year-old hair salon in Bloomingdale to remind residents that the neighborhood they see today isn't what it used to be.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/18/as-gentrification-alters-dc-shop-sign-captures-ten/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "District of Columbia native Latosha Jackson-Martin wants the sign she posted outside her father\u2019s 50-year-old hair salon in Bloomingdale to remind residents that the neighborhood they see today isn\u2019t what it used to be.", "title": "As gentrification alters DC, shop sign captures tension"}, "twitter": {"description": "District of Columbia native Latosha Jackson-Martin wants the sign she posted outside her father's 50-year-old hair salon in Bloomingdale to remind residents that the neighborhood they see today isn't", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "As gentrification alters DC, shop sign captures tension"}, "Author": "PERRY STEIN", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca857\"", "article_summary": "She said he contributed much to the Bloomingdale community, and she would like to see a street named after him.\n\u201cDue to \u2018gentrification\u2019 and mixed emotions Jak and Company Hairdressers will be closing,\u201d reads the blunt message.\nJackson-Martin\u2019s father, William Jackson, opened Jak & Co.
