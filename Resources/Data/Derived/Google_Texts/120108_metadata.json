The \u201ctrouble tickets,\u201d as brokers call them, start with the date and end with a sequence number, such as 141215-001234. Brokers assume the tickets are issued sequentially \u2014 in simple numerical order.\n\nOne broker received a a sequence number just under 9000 on Monday, Dec. 15, the deadline for enrolling for coverage effective Jan. 1. On preceding days, the numbers were running in the 3000-4000 range. Connect for Health officials say it is a wrong assumption that 3,000 to 4,000 enrollees were experiencing problems those days, in part because a person who calls more than once will generate multiple ticket numbers.\n\n\u201cEvery call received is logged with an incident or tracking number,\u201d Clarke said. \u201cWhen we send an automated email response, they get numbers. And we may create multiple numbers for a single issue because the same person contacts us more than once.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just for people who had the patience to wait on hold for most of an hour,\u201d said ACA-certified broker Mike Eubanks, co-owner of Rosita Risk Management LLC in Colorado Springs.\n\nThe high volumes create longer waits, Clarke said.\n\nClarke said the exchange can quantify unresolved account problems by running a special report. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the time to do that immediately while helping customers,\u201d Clarke said.\n\n\u201cThat said, we have received many reports of technical problems,\u201d he said. \u201cThe majority have been forgotten passwords and locked accounts.\u201d\n\nSince Nov. 10, the technical problems officials have seen involve the financial application process for tax credits or Medicaid. The process has confused users into starting over and thus making multiple applications. Some users also are seeing a \u201c500\u201d (server) error message at some point in the process, Clarke said. And people have reported errors the exchange can\u2019t duplicate in its own testing.\n\n\u201cWe remain committed to completing January enrollments for anyone who initiated the process before Dec. 15 \u2014 whether they are working on their application alone or with assistance,\u201d Clarke said in a statement Tuesday.\n\nEubanks, who said he also has been a website developer for a long time, doesn\u2019t find the Connect for Health site even minimally user-friendly.\n\n\u201cWe experienced lockups or crashes at more than 10 different points in their systems,\u201d Eubanks said of the merged Connect for Health and Medicaid enrollment portal.\n\n\u201cHold times on the broker support line regularly ran close to an hour for the last several weeks,\u201d Eubanks said. \u201cThe broker support line was periodically down completely, and often dropped calls mid-conversation.\u201d\n\nAs The Denver Post has heard from more than a dozen would-be health insurance consumers, the site\u2019s Live Chat function required wait times of more than an hour, he said, and then often ended with a message that no one was available, try back later.\n\nEubanks said he was told by Connect for Health reps on the phone that about half of all tax-credit calculations coming to them from the Medicaid side, PEAK (Program Eligibility and Application Kit) side were wrong. Clarke said this is inaccurate.\n\n\u201cThere have been reports about incorrect APTC levels (Advance Premium Tax Credits),\u201d Clarke said. \u201cIn many cases it has involved customers who thought the levels were incorrect because the amount dropped (from 2014) \u2014 a factor of premium changes across much of the state.\u201d\n\nEubanks said the enrollment experience this year has been more difficult for a wide range of reasons.\n\n\u201cAs I see it, this was a fiasco to rival the federal ACA site last year,\u201d Eubanks said. \u201cMuch, much worse than last year\u201d in Colorado.\n\nHowever, he said, \u201ccourteous, professional, patient, and clear\u201d exchange reps were a bright spot in the ordeal.", "article_metadata": {"Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Dose", "description": "Brokers and agents in the field continue to report serious problems with online enrollment with Connect for Health Colorado, the state health insurance exchange established under the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Colorado health insurance brokers reporting problems with Connect for Health enrollment site", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/health/2014/12/16/colorado-health-insurance-brokers-reporting-problems-connect-health-enrollment-site/4709/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/health/files/2014/10/rsz_c4health.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Brokers and agents in the field continue to report serious problems with online enrollment with Connect for Health Colorado, the state health insurance exchange established under the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Colorado health insurance brokers reporting problems with Connect for Health enrollment site", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/health/2014/12/16/colorado-health-insurance-brokers-reporting-problems-connect-health-enrollment-site/4709/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/health/files/2014/10/rsz_c4health.jpg", "creator": "@electadraper", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "follow, all", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Affordable Care Act,Connect for Health Colorado"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd39e7\"", "article_summary": "Brokers and agents in the field continue to report serious problems with online enrollment at Connect for Health Colorado, the state health insurance exchange established under the Affordable Care Act.\nSome users also are seeing a \u201c500\u201d (server) error message at some point in the process, Clarke said.\nConnect for Health officials report they enrolled about 12,600 people in health and dental insurance Monday, Dec. 15 \u2014 \u201cmore than any single day ever before on the marketplace,\u201d an exchange spokesman said.\n\u201cEvery call received is logged with an incident or tracking number,\u201d Clarke said.\nEubanks, who said he also has been a website developer for a long time, doesn\u2019t find the Connect for Health site even minimally user-friendly."}
