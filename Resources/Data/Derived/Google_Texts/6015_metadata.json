Then Derrick Rose. John Wall has erased a pair of major 0-fers against two of the top point guards in the NBA.\n\nWall beat Rose head-to-head for the first time Friday night, getting 16 points and 12 assists in a 102-86 win over the Chicago Bulls.\n\nThe leader in All-Star votes among Eastern Conference guards snapped his 0-5 record when both he and Rose are on the court. It hasn\u2019t happened often because both have had serious injury problems. But Wall was definitely keeping track \u2014 just as he was last month when he ended his 0-6 history against Paul in a win over the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t I finally beat Chris and Derrick this year?\u201d Wall said with a smile. \u201cIt\u2019s a good year. It\u2019s a good start. It\u2019s finally good to beat them.\u201d\n\nRose was the No. 1 overall pick in the NBA draft in 2008, and Wall had the same honor two years later. The Wizards beat the Bulls in five games in a contentious first-round playoff series last year, which Rose missed because of a lengthy recovery from knee surgery.\n\n\u201cYou can tell he worked on his game,\u201d Rose said. \u201cTonight, they jumped on us. It wasn\u2019t about the matchup, I would say. They jumped on us pretty quick from the beginning.\u201d\n\nThe Bulls missed 20 of their first 24 shots and trailed 30-10 before Tony Snell\u2019s 3-pointer in the final second of the first quarter. It was Chicago\u2019s worst output in an opening period this season.\n\nRose has been in a horrid shooting slump \u2014 25.5 percent over his previous six games \u2014 and he went 8 for 19 and scored 19 points Friday night.\n\nRose shook his head emphatically \u2014 as if to say \u201cNo Way!\u201d \u2014 after blocking Wall\u2019s attempt at a buzzer-beating jumper at the end of the first half. It would have carried more meaning if the Bulls weren\u2019t trailing by 17 at the time following a Wall-led run.\n\nRose gets his chance to start a new Wall streak in Chicago next week.\n\n\u201cWe know they\u2019re going to hold this in their head,\u201d Wall said, \u201cbecause we play them again Wednesday.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "First, Chris Paul.
