Scott Walker says states should not bolster Obamacare in any way if the Supreme Court decides to strike down the law\u2019s subsidies in at least 34 states.\n\nThe likely GOP presidential candidate said the White House will be squarely to blame if the justices say the wording of the Affordable Care Act limited the tax credits to the handful of states that set up their own insurance exchanges.\n\nIn fact, he said Mr. Obama should \u201cadmit his failure\u201d and \u201cdo the right thing\u201d by repealing his own law and working with congressional Republicans to replace it.\n\n\u201cThe decision will be a turning point,\u201d Mr. Walker wrote in an op-ed for CNN. \u201cStates didn\u2019t create this problem, Washington did. Governors across the country have been clear: If the Supreme Court strikes down the Obama executive overreach, we will not bail out Obama at the expense of the American people. We will not set up state exchanges under the rules of Obamacare.\u201d\n\nMr. Walker, who is expected to officially enter the 2016 race in the coming weeks, is evoking a common theme among Republican watchers of the court challenge known as King v. Burwell, which will be decided as early as Thursday.\n\nStates that rely on the federal HealthCare.gov portal will be tempted to set up their own Obamacare exchanges to remain eligible for subsidies.\n\nRepublicans in Congress don\u2019t want states to further entrench Obamacare, so they\u2019re crafting ways to rescue more than 6 million Americans who could lose their subsidies under the ruling, while moving away from the president\u2019s overhaul.\n\nMr. Walker acknowledged that 184,000 of his constituents could lose their subsidies, and that it would be \u201ca big problem.\u201d But he did not prescribe a solution, saying it was up to the administration to have a backup plan and then rip up its own law.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear Obamacare must be repealed and replaced with a plan that puts patients and their families back in charge,\u201d he wrote.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Wisconsin Gov.
