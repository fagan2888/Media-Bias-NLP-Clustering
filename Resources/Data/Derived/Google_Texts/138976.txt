In a newly released campaign video, 2016 Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton reiterates her support and defense for Obamacare.

"We've got to defend the Affordable Care Act," the former secretary of state says in the minute-long video.

The video comes just days after the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of federal subsidies â€” a major victory for the healthcare law.

The ad, which is her first healthcare focused one of the 2016 cycle, features an emotional moment between Clinton and Meghan Richardson, a high school student who suffers from cystic fibrosis. According to Richardson, without Obamacare, it would have been extremely difficult for her to receive health insurance because of the chronic lung condition.

Clinton also reminds her supporters about her 25 years of experience working to get Americans easier access to healthcare.

"No child, no adult, should go without quality, affordable healthcare. My pledge, as it has been for 25 years, is I will do anything I can to make that promise," she says to the small crowd of supporters, including Richardson.

As first lady during her husband Bill Clinton's first term as president, she was part of a task force that attempted to bring universal healthcare to the nation. However, it failed without strong support from both sides of the aisle.
