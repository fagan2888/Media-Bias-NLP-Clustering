Several players took photos with O\u2019Neill after the meeting Saturday night and posted them on social media, including quarterback Robert Griffin III, wide receiver Pierre Gar\u00e7on and nose tackle Chris Baker.\n\n\u201cIt was pretty cool,\u201d said outside linebacker Ryan Kerrigan. \u201cI mean, obviously, what he\u2019s done, the way he\u2019s sacrificed a lot of things in life for people like us and for our country\u2019s betterment is awesome. It was really cool to meet him.\u201d\n\nPHOTOS: Redskins-Bucs gallery\n\nIt\u2019s not uncommon for NFL teams to invite guest speakers to their team meetings the night before a game, but the Redskins do not do it regularly.\n\nA reporter\u2019s request to speak to O\u2019Neill was declined by a Redskins spokesman, who said O\u2019Neill was merely trying to enjoy the game as a fan.\n\nPlayers said O\u2019Neill spoke about the tenets of leadership and accountability and how what he learned during nearly two decades in the military can be applied to team sports.\n\nSEE ALSO: As Redskins sink deeper with loss to Bucs, nothing left to do but \u2018get angry\u2019\n\nO\u2019Neill, who became a public speaker after leaving the Navy in 2012, revealed his identity only after it became a loosely guarded secret among top military leaders and several members of Congress.\n\nHe was one of the members of the unit that stormed bin Laden\u2019s compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan in May 2011. He also was among those who helped rescue those aboard the Maersk Alabama, which was overtaken by Somali pirates in the Indian Ocean in 2009.\n\nGriffin said he understood the parallels O\u2019Neill made between military life and football, especially as the son of two Army sergeants.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost exactly the same, it\u2019s just we\u2019re just not putting our lives on the line, per se, in the way that they are,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cWe put our careers on the line. You see Trent [Williams] go down [injured] today, and that was disheartening for everybody, but [O\u2019Neill] said, \u2018If you make a mistake, you own it. You own that mistake.\u2019\n\n\u201cWhen things go right, it doesn\u2019t matter who gets the credit. Everybody gets the credit. That\u2019s why it took so long for it to come out that he was the one who shot him, because it doesn\u2019t matter who shot him. We shot him. Who won? We won.
