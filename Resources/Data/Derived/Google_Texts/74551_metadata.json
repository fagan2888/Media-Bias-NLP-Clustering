We are seeing huge declines in HPV infection rates in the U.S. overall and especially among those who have received the vaccine.\u201d\n\nThe vaccine is given in three doses over six months. Overall, 33 percent of girls have had three shots while 28 percent of those below the poverty line received the injections, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nHPV is the most commonly sexually transmitted infection in the U.S. with 75 percent of Americans infected at some point, O\u2019Leary said. It is also a leading cause of cervical cancer in women and throat cancer in men.\n\nThe study\u2019s researchers recommend that health care providers fully explain the need for the vaccines to their patients and he necessity of three shots.\n\n\u201cThe HPV vaccine is one of the few tools we have that actually prevents cancer,\u201d O\u2019Leary said.", "article_metadata": {"Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Dose", "description": "Cultural differences reason some girls don't get HPV vaccines", "title": "Cultural differences reason some girls don't get HPV vaccines", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/health/2013/10/14/cultural-differences-reason-some-girls-dont-get-hpv-vaccines/3747/", "image": "http://local.denverpost.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/denverpost.png?v=21060130", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Cultural differences reason some girls don't get HPV vaccines", "title": "Cultural differences impact why some girls don\u2019t get HPV vaccines", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/health/2013/10/14/cultural-differences-reason-some-girls-dont-get-hpv-vaccines/3747/", "image": "http://local.denverpost.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/denverpost.png?v=21060130", "creator": "@karencrummy", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Cultural differences reason some girls don't get HPV vaccines"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3ba1\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe HPV vaccine is one of the few tools we have that actually prevents cancer,\u201d O\u2019Leary said.\nHPV is the most commonly sexually transmitted infection in the U.S. with 75 percent of Americans infected at some point, O\u2019Leary said.\nThe study\u2019s researchers recommend that health care providers fully explain the need for the vaccines to their patients and he necessity of three shots.\nIt is also a leading cause of cervical cancer in women and throat cancer in men.\nCultural differences may explain why some girls in minority groups and low-income families \u2013 who have a statistically higher risk of cervical cancer \u2013 are not getting the human papillomavirus or HPV vaccine, according to a new study from the University of Colorado School of Medicine and Children\u2019s Hospital Colorado."}
