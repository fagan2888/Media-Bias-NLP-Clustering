A federal judge says HHS needs a congressional appropriation to make PPACA cost-sharing reduction subsidy payments.

A U.S. District Court judge today issued a ruling that could block the operation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) cost-sharing reduction subsidy program.

The program helps PPACA public exchange plan users with income under 250 percent of the federal poverty level pay the plan deductibles, coinsurance amounts and co-payments.
