Purple Day, (World Epilepsy Day), is March 26, so now is the time to learn a little more about the disorder. Here are four things about epilepsy you probably didn\u2019t know.\n\nEpilepsy Can Be treated With Marijuana\n\nThe medical marijuana movement has taken off, with many patients using the plant to treat ailments ranging from nausea to multiple sclerosis. Epilepsy is one of those ailments. Lawmakers have approved several clinical studies testing marijuana-based drugs, and many states have allowed both adults and children to use cannabis to treat seizures. The treatments have proven successful, especially in helping children at risk of frequent or particularly aggressive seizures. Critics say marijuana treatments will get kids smoking earlier in life, but parents of epileptic children who have seen success with the treatments don\u2019t seem to mind the criticism, probably because their kids aren\u2019t using the marijuana in a smokeable form.\n\n\u201cI feel like it\u2019s saved his life \u2014 it has saved his life,\u201d said Tanesha Smelser, mother to a 9-year-old child who uses a marijuana oil medication. \u201cI know it sounds scary, and I know it sounds unconventional, but it\u2019s working. It\u2019s working!\u201d\n\nNot All Seizures Involve Convulsions\n\nThough a seizure may look the scariest when it involves violent shaking, a person can actually have a seizure without anyone else noticing. An absence seizure can cause a short period in which the person zones out, or stares into space. Absence seizures, which are also called petit mal seizures, can last only a short time \u2014 sometimes less than 10 seconds \u2014 so they\u2019re often missed or mistaken for daydreaming. Absence seizures are caused by abnormal brain activity just like any other seizure, but they typically cause a person to be unaware of what\u2019s going on around them, and may even lead them to stop speaking in the middle of a sentence.\n\nThis type of seizure usually doesn\u2019t require first aid, as the person will normally just continue doing whatever they were doing before the seizure.\n\nEpilepsy Is More Prevalent In Developing Countries\n\nThough epilepsy is common all over the world, it\u2019s developing countries that seem to be hit the hardest. Approximately 50 million people worldwide have the disorder, but nearly 80 percent of them live in low and middle-income countries. Studies have identified high incidence of risk factors, including head trauma, complications during childbirth, and parasitic infections as the reason for the high number of people with epilepsy in these regions. Despite the burden of the disorder, there is a significant treatment gap in poorer nations \u2014 over 60 percent of people with epilepsy in these nations do not have access to appropriate care.\n\nThe Color Of Epilepsy Awareness Is Lavender\n\nMarch 26 is actually called Purple Day, since lavender is the color for epilepsy awareness. This is for good reason: seizures are generally caused by abnormal electrical impulses in the brain, so one approach to treating them is relaxing the brain and nervous system. Lavender, both the color and the plant, are said to have this effect \u2014 the plant has even been proven to act as a central nervous system relaxant and anticonvulsant.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "epilepsy, awareness, day, 4, things, you, didnt, know, about, neurological, disorder", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Epilepsy affects 50 million people worldwide, so learn a bit about the condition on Purple Day.", "title": "Epilepsy Awareness Day: 4 Things You Didn\u2019t Know About The Disorder", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/epilepsy-awareness-day-neurological-disorder-purple-day-379428", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/03/25/lavender.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Epilepsy affects 50 million people worldwide, so learn a bit about the condition on Purple Day.", "title": "Epilepsy Awareness Day: 4 Things You Didn\u2019t Know About The Disorder", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/epilepsy-awareness-day-neurological-disorder-purple-day-379428", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/03/25/lavender.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/03/25/lavender.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2016-03-25T13:23:39-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-25T13:23:38-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Epilepsy affects 50 million people worldwide, so learn a bit about the condition on Purple Day."}, "article_summary": "Purple Day, (World Epilepsy Day), is March 26, so now is the time to learn a little more about the disorder.\nEpilepsy is the fourth most common neurological disorder, with an estimated 2.2 million people living with it in the U.S.\nHere are four things about epilepsy you probably didn\u2019t know.\nMost people associate epilepsy with seizures and bright flashing lights, and while these are accurate associations, there\u2019s much more to it.\nApproximately 50 million people worldwide have the disorder, but nearly 80 percent of them live in low and middle-income countries."}
