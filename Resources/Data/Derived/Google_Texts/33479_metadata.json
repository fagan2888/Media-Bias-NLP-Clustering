Bush took a cold splash for charity.\n\nWith the help of his daughter, Jenna Bush Hager, and wife, former First Lady Laura Bush, Bush accepted the Ice Bucket Challenge. However, it did not come without a short-lived protest.\n\nBush first acknowledged his challengers \u2014 Woody Johnson, Jenna Bush Hager, 49ers coach Jim Harbaugh and Rory McIlroy \u2014 and then questioned whether the cold shower is \u201cpresidential.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo you all that challenged me, I do not think it\u2019s presidential for me to be splashed with ice water,\u201d Bush said in the video. \u201cSo I\u2019m simply going to write you a check.\u201d\n\nHowever, Laura had other plans. While Bush was writing the check, Laura dumped a bucket of cold water on his head.\n\nBush\u2019s protest was an obvious nod to President Obama who declined to take the chilly shower after he was challenged by the Kennedy family.\n\n\u201cHis contribution to this effort will be monetary,\u201d the White House said in a statement on Aug. 13.\n\nBush then took the opportunity to challenge a close friend.\n\n\u201cNow it\u2019s my privilege to challenge my friend Bill Clinton to the ALS challenge. Yesterday was Bill\u2019s birthday and my gift to Bill is a bucket of cold water,\u201d Bush said in the video.\n\nThe ALS Ice Bucket Challenge has raised $24 million for ALS research.", "article_metadata": {"description": "http://youtu.be/DepakUSDtQE?rel=0 Like millions of people across the country, George W.
