Jim Gibbs of the Belfast Police Department.\n\n\u201cWe believe it was a mechanical failure. We don\u2019t know why it locked up,\u201d Gibbs said Saturday.\n\nThe rider traveling next to Giggey told police the motorcyclist\u2019s eyes were \u201cas big as saucers\u201d when he lost control and started to skid. The motorcycle traveled 465 feet from the first mark on the road until it came to a halt. Giggey skidded a total of 410 feet, Gibbs said.\n\n\u201cHe just got very lucky,\u201d the officer said.\n\nGiggey, who was wearing blue jeans but not a helmet, suffered road rash on his body and face. When emergency responders from the police department, Belfast Ambulance and Belfast Fire & Rescue arrived at the scene, they assisted Giggey and took him to Waldo County General Hospital in Belfast to be treated.\n\nNo cars were involved in the accident, Gibbs said, and police were able to measure the skid marks without shutting down the busy coastal thoroughfare.", "article_metadata": {"description": "BELFAST, Maine \u2014 A motorcyclist from Lincoln who skidded more than 400 feet on U.S. Route 1 on Saturday after losing control of his bike suffered significant road rash but was alert and conscious when first responders arrived to help.
