While preservation of existing resources is critical, the scientific community these days has been coming up with surprising \u2013 and in some cases, disgusting \u2013 new ways to obtain clean water.\n\nHere\u2019s a head-spinning one: Scientists at Michigan State University are developing a system that actually takes cow manure and turns it into water clean enough for livestock to drink.\n\nKnown as the McLanahan Nutrient Separation System, the process also extracts nutrients from that water to serve as fertilizer. The system could be ready for commercialization by the end of the year.\n\nRelated: $12.3B Water Bill Awash in Rare Bipartisan Effort\n\n\u201cIf you have 1,000 cows on your operation, they produce about 10 million gallons of manure a year,\u201d Steve Safferman, an associate professor of biosystems and agricultural engineering who is involved in the project, told Michigan State University Today. \u201cAbout 90 percent of that manure is water.\u201d\n\nSome people fervently believe that if the water is clean enough for livestock, then it\u2019s also appropriate for humans.\n\n\u201cIf you ask the average American whether they would drink water from cow manure, they\u2019d say no,\u201d Lynn Wilson, executive director at SeaTrust Institute and academic department chair for public administration at Kaplan University, said in an interview. \u201cBut clean water is clean water.\u201d\n\nShe added that there\u2019s a psychological challenge for Americans when it comes to getting used to the idea that they could be drinking water from cow manure. \u201cWe have to change the mindset of Americans,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re in a learning curve. They\u2019ll say yes [to clean water from cow manure] when there\u2019s no more water.\u201d\n\nThat day may come faster than we think. By 2030, nearly half the world\u2019s population could be facing a scarcity of water, with demand outstripping supply by 40 percent, U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said last year.\n\nAfter all, Americans in several communities throughout the U.S. are already drinking water that comes from the sewer. Yes, you read that correctly!\n\nRelated: What Extreme Weather Is Really Costing Us\n\nWichita Falls, a Texas town near Dallas that has been under exceptional drought conditions, has a big black pipe connecting the city\u2019s wastewater facility to the water treatment plant. Residents who understand how bad the water shortage has become are supporting the project.\n\nIn California, a state that\u2019s experienced pronounced drought in recent years, sewage is all the rage as well. Orange County Water District has one of the oldest and largest wastewater treatment facilities that can recycle sewage water into drinking water.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The drought in California is bringing renewed attention to water shortages in certain areas of the country and the need for more clean water sources overall.
