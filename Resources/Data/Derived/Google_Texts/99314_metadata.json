So far, no one has the important religious right vote sewn up.\n\nThere was a lot of agreement on display, against abortion and same-sex marriage, for religious liberty, and for a strong alliance with Israel.\n\nBusinessman Donald Trump was the outlier, who kept up his pattern of controversial statements. Trump says he doesn\u2019t regret his recent comments against Mexican immigrants.\n\n\u201cNo, not all,\u201d Trump says. \u201c I\u2019m very happy.\u201d\n\nTrump also questioned the war hero status of Arizona Senator John McCain. And he flubbed at least one answer, telling the religious audience he\u2019s never asked God for forgiveness for his sins.\n\nThere were no such flubs from the other presidential hopefuls seeking to win the hearts of evangelicals. Texas Senator Ted Cruz earned the first standing ovation of the day, calling for total de-funding of Planned Parenthood.\n\n\u201cWe will take this country back for our values,\u201d Cruz says.\n\nWisconsin Governor Scott Walker said Jesus Christ is his personal savior.\n\nFormer Arkansas Governor and ordained minister Mike Huckabee gave a religious twist to the issue of racial conflict.\n\n\u201cWe don't have a skin problem in America,\u201d Huckabee says. \u201cWe have a sin problem in America. That is the root and cause of racial strife.\u201d\n\nQuestions from the audience strayed beyond religious themes. Recent Ames High School graduate Jared Larson quizzed neurosurgeon Ben Carson.\n\n\u201cDo you believe all members of our military should be armed in order to defend themselves?\u201d Larson asked, referring to last week\u2019s fatal shooting of Marines at a recruiting station in Tennessee.\n\n\u201cConsidering what happened in Chattanooga, of course they should be armed,\u201d Carson says. \u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d\n\nA small business owner asked if it\u2019s really possible to repeal Obamacare, now that it\u2019s been upheld by the U.S. supreme Court.\n\n\u201cThe simple answer is yes,\u201d replied former Texas Governor Rick Perry.\n\nSouth Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham was one of the harshest on Hillary Clinton.\n\nOut in the lobby, Healing Touch Books from Altoona was doing a brisk business in books written by the candidates.\n\nISU student Adam Neuhouser has already read Ben Carson\u2019s book. He bought A time for Truth by Ted Cruz.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know very much about Ted Cruz,\u201d Neuhouser says. \u201cSo I\u2019m looking forward to reading his book.\u201d\n\nNeuhouser calls Cruz a strong Christian man. And he likes Florida Senator Marco Rubio because of his strong support for Israel.\n\nAnother small business owner Greg Theroux of Des Moines has some reading to do.\n\n\u201cToday I bought Dr. Carson\u2019s, Rick Santorum\u2019s, and Bobby Jindal\u2019s book,\u201d Theroux says. \u201cAnd I\u2019m looking at several others too.\u201d\n\nSo it appears that even some of the past darlings of the evangelical set including Mike Huckabee in 2008 and Rick Santorum in 2012 aren\u2019t getting a free pass this time. One voter says he sees a lot of candidates who are of equal or better value.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics & Elections", "description": "Ten Republican Presidential candidates vied for the evangelical vote Saturday in Ames at a forum sponsored by the leading Christian conservative group the", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://iowapublicradio.org/post/iowa-evangelicals-undecided-presidential-race", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/ipr/files/styles/medium/public/201507/0718cruz.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Ten Republican Presidential candidates vied for the evangelical vote Saturday in Ames at a forum sponsored by the leading Christian conservative group the", "title": "Iowa Evangelicals Undecided on Presidential Race"}, "story_id": 424344614, "twitter": {"site": "@IowaPublicRadio", "card": "summary", "creator": "@IowaPublicRadio"}, "author": "Joyce Russell", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Iowa Evangelicals Undecided on Presidential Race"}, "nid": 60887, "datePublished": "2015-07-19", "keywords": "news, 2016 Caucuses, Religion, Iowa Politics, Family Leadership Summit Audio;", "wordCount": 771, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd15c9\"", "article_summary": "Texas Senator Ted Cruz earned the first standing ovation of the day, calling for total de-funding of Planned Parenthood.\n\u201cThe simple answer is yes,\u201d replied former Texas Governor Rick Perry.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know very much about Ted Cruz,\u201d Neuhouser says.\nHe bought A time for Truth by Ted Cruz.\nThere were no such flubs from the other presidential hopefuls seeking to win the hearts of evangelicals."}
