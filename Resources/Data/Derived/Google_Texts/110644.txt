The first week of March 2015 saw the release of two major hospital rankings lists, the Healthgrades Top 100 and the Truven Top 100. But aside from the number of healthcare providers honored, very little looked the same between the two lists.

For Healthgrades, criteria focused on clinical outcomes, especially related to a set of common medical procedures, while Truven, an analytics firm, mixed clinical outcomes witrh organization and financial benchmarks. The result is a grand pool of more than 200 hospitals with only a handful earning accolades from both agencies.

To be precise, only 12 hospitals ended up on both lists

The following slideshow highlights those hospitals.
