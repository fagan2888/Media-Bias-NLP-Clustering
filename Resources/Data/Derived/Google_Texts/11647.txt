LEON, Iowa â€” Mike Huckabee, a former Arkansas governor and current Republican presidential candidate, called the Supreme Court's decision Thursday to protect the Affordable Care Act "an out-of-control act of judicial tyranny."

"Our Founding Fathers didn't create a 'do-over' provision in our Constitution that allows unelected Supreme Court justices the power to circumvent Congress and rewrite bad laws," Huckabee said in a statement provided to The Washington Post.

"The Supreme Court cannot legislate from the bench, ignore the Constitution, and pass a multi-trillion dollar 'fix' to ObamaCare simply because Congress misread what the states would actually do," his statement continued. "The architects and authors of ObamaCare were intentional in the way they wrote the law. The courts have no constitutional authority to rescue Congress from creating bad law. The solution is for Congress to admit they screwed up, repeal the 'nightmare of Obamacare,' and let states road-test real health care reforms."

Huckabee, who is campaigning throughout rural south-central Iowa all day Thursday, pulled over at a gas station to review the court's King v. Burwell ruling.

Huckabee said in his statement that the Affordable Care Act has been a "Washington disaster" that's resulted in families "getting punched in the gut with outrageous insurance premiums and infuriating hospital bills."

"As President, I will protect Medicare, repeal ObamaCare, and pass real reform that will actually lower costs, while focusing on cures and prevention rather than intervention," Huckabee said. "The status quo is unfair, unaffordable, unsustainable and completely un-American."
