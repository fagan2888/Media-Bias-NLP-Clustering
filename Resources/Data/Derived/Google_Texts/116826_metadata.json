The Massachusetts effort, however, is showing some signs that may not bode well for Obamacare, says Dr. Danny McCormick, associate professor at the Harvard Medical School and one of the authors of the study.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s potentially troubling,\u201d McCormick said.\n\nThe study shows that from late 2004\u2014about 21 months before Romneycare was implemented\u2014to late 2009, the rate of preventable hospital admissions came down 2.1% in Massachusetts. But in three nearby states that had no health reform\u2014New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania\u2014that rate came down 3.5% during that time.\n\nFurther, the study shows that the rate of preventable admissions for white and Hispanics came down at a faster rate in those three nearby states than they did in Massachusetts. For blacks, preventable admissions went up at an unadjusted rate of 1.8% from 2004 to 2009 in Massachusetts, and slightly higher\u20142.1% -- in the other three states.\n\nThe Harvard study might be a bit more comprehensive than that of earlier studies, McCormick says. Roughly 900,000 patient records were examined as part of the effort. Since Obamacare was implemented last year, Massachusetts has altered its health plan to get in line with the federal tenets, including provisions for minimum coverage.\n\nThere are several key differences between the earlier Massachusetts experience and Obamacare, McCormick says, but it doesn\u2019t erase all concerns.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to assign a weight to all of these factors,\u201d he said.\n\nFirst, Romneycare also only offered subsidies to households with income at 300% of the federal poverty level. Obamacare raised that threshold to 400% of the federal poverty level, he says.\n\nMassachusetts also had a so-called \u201csafety net\u201d before 2006 in which hospitals that treated indigent patients were reimbursed by the state, a feature that doesn\u2019t exist in many other states.\n\nFinally, the uninsured rate in Massachusetts was much lower than the rest of the nation, sitting at roughly 12% before Romneycare, and brought down to about 6% afterward. In states such as Texas and California, the uninsured rate had exceeded 30%, McCormick says, but the average reduction in the number of uninsured will be roughly seven to eight points.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s higher than [Massachusetts] but it\u2019s not dramatically higher,\u201d he said.\n\nHenry Aaron, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, says the stronger health-care system that existed in Massachusetts before Romneycare could prove to be a major difference between it and Obamacare.\n\n\u201cMassachusetts was already the best-insured state in the U.S. even before Romneycare went into effect,\u201d Aaron said, pointing out it also offered cutting-edge care.\n\n\u201cMost of the rest of the U.S. can\u2019t make that statement,\u201d Aaron said.\n\nMore from MarketWatch", "article_metadata": {"lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "description": "Trouble in getting some hospitalization rates down under Massachusetts\u2019 Romneycare program may not bode well for Obamacare", "creator": "@russbrittmktw", "image": {"width": 1320, "identifier": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DI964_romney_ZG_20150401151857.jpg", "height": 742}, "site": {"id": 624413}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "parsely-author": "Russ Britt", "article.content_group": "marketwatch", "article.section": "Industries", "parsely-type": "post", "description": "Trouble in getting some hospitalization rates down under Massachusetts\u2019 Romneycare program may not bode well for Obamacare", "parsely-link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/romneycares-inability-to-make-inroads-may-not-bode-well-for-obamacare-2015-04-01", "author": "Russ Britt", "parsely-title": "Romneycare\u2019s inability to make inroads may not bode well for Obamacare", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=336693422", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-04-01T16:39:00-04:00", "page.site": "marketwatch", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 283204329838}, "parsely-section": "MW_Industries", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "MarketWatch", "description": "Trouble in getting some hospitalization rates down under Massachusetts\u2019 Romneycare program may not bode well for Obamacare", "title": "Romneycare\u2019s inability to make inroads may not bode well for Obamacare", "url": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/romneycares-inability-to-make-inroads-may-not-bode-well-for-obamacare-2015-04-01", "image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DI964_romney_ZG_20150401151857.jpg", "type": "article"}, "ob": {"image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DI964_romney_ZG_20150401151857.jpg"}, "article.id": "C5BE727A-D898-11E4-BCC3-E0D4FB5F3554", "position": 1}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1dca\"", "article_summary": "There are several key differences between the earlier Massachusetts experience and Obamacare, McCormick says, but it doesn\u2019t erase all concerns.\nThe Massachusetts effort, however, is showing some signs that may not bode well for Obamacare, says Dr. Danny McCormick, associate professor at the Harvard Medical School and one of the authors of the study.\nFinally, the uninsured rate in Massachusetts was much lower than the rest of the nation, sitting at roughly 12% before Romneycare, and brought down to about 6% afterward.\nSince Obamacare was implemented last year, Massachusetts has altered its health plan to get in line with the federal tenets, including provisions for minimum coverage.\nBut in three nearby states that had no health reform\u2014New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania\u2014that rate came down 3.5% during that time."}
