The legislation, S.B. 569, passed the Republican controlled House with a vote of 70-8 and now heads to pro-life Governor Asa Hutchinson\u2019s desk.\n\nThankfully, Arkansas also has a constitutional amendment barring public money from funding abortions, except to save the life of the mother. However, previously abortion businesses in the state received federal grants to be \u201cnavigators\u201d under Obamacare. Pro-lifers were opposed to this because they said it indirectly funding of abortion.\n\nAs LifeNews previously reported, by choosing Planned Parenthood affiliates to be Navigators in the federally facilitated Exchanges, affiliates had the the seal of approval of the federal government as an entity that consumers can contact for help in applying for coverage. Moreover, HHS listed the Navigators (e.g., Planned Parenthood) in each federally facilitated Exchange on HHS\u2019 official government website as a resource to help consumers.\n\nCLICK LIKE IF YOU\u2019RE PRO-LIFE!\n\nAdditionally, on March 24th, an Arkansas legislative committee approved a bill that would revise the state\u2019s informed-consent law. The legislation, House Bill 1578, requires abortionists to provide patients with more detailed information on the medical risks that can be associated with abortion. Specifically, the pro-life legislation will increase the waiting period from 24 hours to 48 hours as well as require abortionists to discuss alternatives, health risks and a detailed description of the unborn child to the woman seeking the abortion. The bill also ensures that abortionists describe fetal pain to a women seeking abortions after 20-weeks.\n\nThe bill\u2019s sponsor, Robin Lundstrum (R-Springdale) said the changes would help women get quality information. She said, \u201cThis bill focuses on a woman\u2019s health, updates the information and helps provide alternatives.\u201d Of course, Planned Parenthood of Arkansaa opposed the measure. A spokeswoman for the abortion business, Angie Heartland, said, \u201cThis bill would create barriers for a woman to receive abortion care if or when she has made the deeply personal and often complex decision to end a pregnancy.\u201d\n\nIn December,Planned Parenthood Federation of America released its 2013-2014 Annual Report. The report indicated that Planned Parenthood did 327,653 abortions in 2013, an increase over the 327,166 abortions it did in 2012. The \u201cnon-profit\u201d also ranked in $305.4 million; and received over a half-billion dollars in taxpayer money, as it took in $540 million in 2012 and $528 million in 2013.\n\nThe vice president of American Life League, Jim Sedlak, commented on the new figures. He said, \u201cDespite this lack of increase in its primary business, Planned Parenthood continued to receive over a half-billion dollars in taxpayer money.\u201d Sedlak added. \u201cIt has such a tremendous publicity machine that it convinced corporate and private donors to increase donations by more than $75 million (from $315.4 million to $391.8 million).\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Arkansas Legislature Passes Bill to Cut Off Funding to Planned Parenthood Abortion Biz", "og": {"site_name": "LifeNews.com", "description": "On Thursday, Arkansas lawmakers voted to cut off public funding to abortion businesses like Planned Parenthood and organizations that refer women to abortion pr", "title": "Arkansas Legislature Passes Bill to Cut Off Funding to Planned Parenthood Abortion Biz", "url": "http://www.lifenews.com/2015/03/27/arkansas-legislature-passes-bill-to-cut-off-funding-to-planned-parenthood-abortion-biz/", "image": "http://www.lifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/plannedparenthood138.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 204509779594999}, "OBKey": "avejq02j7xRr+0owuq+Pcw==", "keywords": "arkansas legislature passes bill to cut off funding to planned parenthood abortion biz", "google-site-verification": "PPPx-GD0i7nWjUFAYnFdOYorAAJLuNyKOl23JCeXyrQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "On Thursday, Arkansas lawmakers voted to cut off public funding to abortion businesses like Planned Parenthood and organizations that refer women to abortion providers.\nThe report indicated that Planned Parenthood did 327,653 abortions in 2013, an increase over the 327,166 abortions it did in 2012.\nMoreover, HHS listed the Navigators (e.g., Planned Parenthood) in each federally facilitated Exchange on HHS\u2019 official government website as a resource to help consumers.\nShe said, \u201cThis bill focuses on a woman\u2019s health, updates the information and helps provide alternatives.\u201d Of course, Planned Parenthood of Arkansaa opposed the measure.\nHe said, \u201cDespite this lack of increase in its primary business, Planned Parenthood continued to receive over a half-billion dollars in taxpayer money.\u201d Sedlak added."}
