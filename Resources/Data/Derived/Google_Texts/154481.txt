A person familiar with the situation says the Winter Classic, the NHL's annual New Year's Day showcase, is coming to Washington for the first time in 2015.

The person Friday confirmed the news to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because Washington Capitals owner Ted Leonsis is expected to make a formal announcement Saturday.

No opponents have been identified, but a rematch of the 2011 Winter Classic against the Pittsburgh Penguins would be a big hit in the ratings.

Leonsis has lobbied to host the game for several years. The Capitals played in the 2011 game as the visiting team against Pittsburgh.

The D.C. area has several potential sites to host the game, including Nationals Park, RFK Stadium and FedEx Field.

Washington radio station 106.7 The Fan first reported Washington was getting an outdoor game, and The Washington Post reported that it would be the Winter Classic.
