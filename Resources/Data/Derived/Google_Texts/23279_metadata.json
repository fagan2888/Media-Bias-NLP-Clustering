In its first year operating in Texas, it gained 43,000 members--helped by the fact that it offered the least expensive mid-level plan on the ACA exchange in San Antonio.\n\nBut Oscar has not been as price-competitive in California, where the insurer accounted for less than 1 percent of plan selections on the state's exchange for 2016, according to recent data from the state. Schlosser tells Bloomberg that he remains optimistic that Oscar will gain traction in California, noting that it was able to rapidly boost its enrollment in New Jersey. The insurer worked with Providence Health to build its network in California, and the two entities have collaborated on a value-based care initiative that lets them share the cost and profits associated with patient care.\n\nIn changing focus to narrow networks, Oscar is following in the footsteps of some Blue Cross Blue Shield plans as well as lesser-known startups like Melody Health Insurance that have embraced the strategy. But federal and state officials are considering new regulations aimed at ensuring narrow-network plans give patients adequate access to providers.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the Bloomberg article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nOscar's California entrance might show whether insurer can transform industry\n\nStartup health insurer embraces narrow-network plan design\n\nBlues exec: Smaller networks can improve care quality, lower costs\n\nMore consumers enrolling in narrow network health insurance plans", "article_metadata": {"description": "The health insurance company that says it wants to disrupt the industry is doing an about-face from the broad network strategy it extolled at its birth in 2012,\u00a0Bloomberg\u00a0reports.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthPayer", "description": "The health insurance company that says it wants to disrupt the industry is doing an about-face from the broad network strategy it extolled at its birth in 2012,\u00a0Bloomberg\u00a0reports.", "title": "In an about-face, Oscar turns to narrow-network strategy to reach enrollment goals", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthpayer.com/story/oscar-health-insurance-corp-narrow-network-strategy-reach-enrollment-goals/2016-02-22", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthpayer.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "healthpayer", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "keywords": "Affordable Care Act Exchanges,Financial Management,Health Insurance Exchanges,Mario Schlosser,Marketing & Consumer Engagement,narrow networks,Oscar Health Insurance,payer-provider collaboration", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Financial Management,Health Insurance Exchanges,Marketing & Consumer Engagement"}, "article_summary": "The health insurance company that says it wants to disrupt the industry is doing an about-face from the broad network strategy it extolled at its birth in 2012, Bloomberg reports.\nStill, Oscar boosted its total enrollment to 145,000 customers in 2016, compared to just 40,000 in 2015, Bloomberg notes.\nBut federal and state officials are considering new regulations aimed at ensuring narrow-network plans give patients adequate access to providers.\nIn changing focus to narrow networks, Oscar is following in the footsteps of some Blue Cross Blue Shield plans as well as lesser-known startups like Melody Health Insurance that have embraced the strategy.\nSchlosser tells Bloomberg that he remains optimistic that Oscar will gain traction in California, noting that it was able to rapidly boost its enrollment in New Jersey."}
