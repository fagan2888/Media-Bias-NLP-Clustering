Her husband, 29-year-old Clayton Butler, said he saw his newlywed wife\u2019s parachute malfunction and tried to jump to save her, but he was not able to reach Amber in time.\n\nButler then hiked more than two hours out of the park, reaching a park ranger just before sunset. Bellow\u2019s body was found on Sunday among rugged rocks at the base of the mountain, park spokeswoman Aly Baltrus said on Monday.\n\nBefore the tragedy, both Bellows and Butler had been very well known in the dangerous sport of BASE jumping. BASE stands for buildings, antennas, spans and earth, the dangerous structures that participants climb before jumping.\n\nBellows and Butler have been featured in many YouTube videos, including a jump from Buttermilk Tower in Utah. The two-minute video shows the couple climbing hundreds of feet up a ladder and jumping from the top of the tower.\n\n\n\nOn Monday the video turned into a de facto memorial for Amber Bellows, with many YouTube users leaving messages.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry for your loss. Looks like she really enjoyed base jumping. RIP Mrs. Butler,\u201d one user wrote.\n\nGiven the dangerous nature of BASE jumping, it is illegal in many locations. Amber Bellows and Clayton Butler had to illegally enter Zion National Park to perform their jump.\n\n\u201cBASE jumping is so dangerous. Even for those that are experienced, like Amber Bellows. That is one of the reasons it is not allowed in the park,\u201d Acting Superintendent Jim Milestone said in a statement.\n\nAmber Bellows was the first person ever to die BASE jumping at Zion National Park.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Amber Bellows had been married just two weeks when she and her husband decided to take an adventurous BASE jumping trip, but the 28-year-old would not leave", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "Amber Bellows had been married just two weeks when she and her husband decided to take an adventurous BASE jumping trip, but the 28-year-old would not leave", "title": "Amber Bellows: Newlywed Killed BASE Jumping Was Expert, Well Known In The Sport", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/1128538/amber-bellows-newlywed-killed-base-jumping-was-expert-well-known-in-the-sport/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Amber-Bellows.jpg", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-10T20:18:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-02-10T20:23:48+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Amber-Bellows.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2014-02-10T20:18:10+00:00", "fb": {"app_id": 164157850314499, "pages": 71179904752}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "amber bellows,amber bellows death,amber bellows killed,base jumping death,news", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Amber-Bellows.jpg", "width": 630, "height": 404}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Amber Bellows had been married just two weeks when she and her husband decided to take an adventurous BASE jumping trip, but the 28-year-old would not leave"}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd6ef\"", "article_summary": "Before the tragedy, both Bellows and Butler had been very well known in the dangerous sport of BASE jumping.\nAmber Bellows was the first person ever to die BASE jumping at Zion National Park.\nLooks like she really enjoyed base jumping.\nGiven the dangerous nature of BASE jumping, it is illegal in many locations.\n\u201cBASE jumping is so dangerous."}
