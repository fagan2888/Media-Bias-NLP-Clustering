The site is in the Hillside Design District above Cliff Drive west of Las Positas Road.\n\nThe project includes a pool and spa, landscaping and 3,870 cubic yards of fill grading.\n\nArchitect Brian Cearnal presented the plan at a recent Santa Barbara Planning Commission meeting.\n\n\u201cI am going to start here with a view of the front door because I think it is important for all you to understand who is going to live in this house and why it is what it is,\u201d\u200b Cearnal said, as he showed a slide of the proposed house during his presentation. \u201cDr. Park was recruited by the Santa Barbara Institute of Neuroscience at Cottage Hospital.\n\n\u201cEssentially he is the only brain (tumor) surgeon between Los Angeles and San Francisco.\u201d\n\nCearnal stressed that the house would be for Park; his wife, Grace, a physician at Sansum Clinic; the Parks' three children, Grace's parents; and Park\u2019s mother.\n\n\u201cRecruiting doctors to Santa Barbara is not an easy thing,\u201d he said. \u201cJohn and his wife, Grace, decided to move their family to Santa Barbara. It is truly an extended, multigenerational home.\u201d\n\nThe planning commission approved a coastal development permit for the house on a 6-0 vote Nov. 6, but recommended that the Single-Family Design Review Board again consider ways to make the house smaller.\n\nThe house exceeds floor-area-ratio guidelines for the size of the lot. The floor-area-ratio measures the size of a house compared to the overall lot size, for a particular neighborhood. The ratios are just guidelines for lots as large as the Parks\u2019, however.\n\nCearnal wants to place the house at the rear of the property, on a manmade hill that would require about 4,000 square yards of fill. The hill would lift the house to give it an ocean view.\n\nAlthough the single-family design ratios are just guidelines, some of the commissioners felt they should still be respected.\n\n\u201cEvery time you go over that 100 percent ... and design it in at over 100 percent, you feed this accumulated (floor-area-ratio) creep to the point that any additions following later to other houses and rebuilds, it is always going to edge its way upward,\u201d commissioner June Pujo said.\n\n\u201cThe continuum will creep higher and higher.\u201d\n\nCommissioner Sheila Lodge said the land ultimately will look much better than it currently appears, but she noted she shares some of Pujo\u2019s concerns.\n\n\u201cI would prefer to see the house just a little bit smaller,\u201d Lodge said. \u201cMr. Cearnal has done a good job fitting it into that upper corner, but it still seems rather large to me.\u201d\n\nCearnal pushed back.\n\n\u201cWe have worked so hard with the Parks to get a house that works for them, and by no means is opulent or excessive in terms of this area,\u201d he said. \u201cI just don\u2019t want to get into an arbitrary trimming of the square footage. We are so close. We meet the intent.\u201d\n\nSeveral of the neighbors immediately next to the Parks\u2019 property have no objections to the size of the proposed house. Some other nearby residents wrote letters in opposition to the project, and at least one neighbor spoke at the meeting in opposition to the house size.\n\n\u201cI think you get the lot you buy,\u201d said Patricia Foley, who lives in the Braemar Ranch neighborhood two blocks to the west of the Parks\u2019 property. \u201cYou don't get to build a hill on a lot and put a house on top. That isn\u2019t fair to our neighborhood.\u201d\n\nShe said the proposal just gentrifies the neighborhood.\n\n\u201cPlease save our bucolic neighborhood,\u201d she said.\n\nBut other neighbors said the house was just fine.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have any objections to the size of the home,\u201d said Taka Nomura, a nearby resident. \u201cIt is a good-sized home for a family of his size. I don\u2019t think it will ruin the appearance of the neighborhood.\u201d\n\nThe project will return to the Single-Family Design Review Board, which has already reviewed the plans three times.\n\nCommissioner Addison Thompson said he supports the project, but not because physicians will live there.\n\n\u201cWith all due respect to Mr. Cearnal and Dr. Park, it really doesn\u2019t matter who is applying for the permit to build the house,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cWe understand that that entered into the decisions that were made on the design. We have seen many projects come in here based upon \u2018this is going to be the family homestead,\u2019 and by the time it\u2019s built it has changed ownership two or three times.\u201d\n\nThompson said the approval should be based on what\u2019s best for the neighborhood.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be there long after all of us are gone, so with due respect we can\u2019t be considering who is going to be living there,\u201d he said.\n\nPark spoke with Noozhawk after the meeting. He said he doesn\u2019t understand the objections.\n\n\u201cWhile we respect the desire of our distant neighbors to preserve the rural character of their neighborhood as it was 20-plus years ago, we are a bit puzzled over their comments referring to our proposed home as out of place in terms of style and size,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe homes currently surrounding our lot have an appealing variety of architectural styles, and a FAR analysis of the neighborhood shows our proposed home to be well below the average size.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Noozhawk staff writer Joshua Molina can be reached at .(JavaScript must be enabled to view this email address) .
