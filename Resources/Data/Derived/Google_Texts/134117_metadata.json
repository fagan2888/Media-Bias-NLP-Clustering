The top capital gains rate has already been raised from 15 percent to 23.8 percent during Obama's presidency.\n\nObama also wants to close what the administration is calling the \"Trust Fund Loophole,\" a change that would require estates to pay capital gains taxes on securities at the time they're inherited. Officials said the overwhelming impact of the change would be on the top 1 percent of income earners.\n\nWhile GOP leaders have said they share Obama's desire to reform the nation's complicated tax code, the party has long been opposed to many of the proposals the president will outline Tuesday. For example, most Republicans want to lower or eliminate the capital gains tax and similarly want to end taxes on estates, not expand them.\n\nAdministration officials pointed to a third proposal from the president as one they hope Republicans would support: a fee on the roughly 100 U.S. financial firms with assets of more than $50 billion. Officials said the fee is similar to a proposal from former Republican Rep. Dave Camp of Michigan, who led the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee. Camp's plan, however, was part of a larger proposal to lower the overall corporate income tax rate.\n\nRaising the capital gains rate, ending the inheritance loophole and tacking a fee on financial firms would generate $320 billion in revenue over a decade, according to administration estimates. Obama wants to put the bulk of that money into a series of measures aimed at helping middle-class Americans. Among them:\n\n\u2022 A credit of up to $500 for families in which both spouses work. The administration says 24 million couples would benefit from the proposal, which would apply to families with annual income up to $210,000.\n\n\u2022 Expanding the child care tax credit to up to $3,000 per child under age 5. The administration says the proposal would help more than 5 million families with the cost of child care.\n\n\u2022 Overhauling the education tax system by consolidating six provisions into two, a move that could cut taxes for 8.5 million families. Republicans have been open to the idea of consolidating education tax breaks.\n\nObama's call for higher taxes on the wealthy could further antagonize Republicans who are already angry with the president over his vows to veto several of the party's priorities, including legislation to approve construction of the Keystone XL oil pipeline, make changes to the Affordable Care Act and block his executive actions on immigration.\n\n\"Slapping American small businesses, savers and investors with more tax hikes only negates the benefits of the tax policies that have been successful in helping to expand the economy, promote savings and create jobs,\" Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, the chairman of the Finance Committee, said in a statement. \"The president needs to stop listening to his liberal allies who want to raise taxes at all costs and start working with Congress to fix our broken tax code.\"\n\nEven before officials revealed Obama's tax proposals, Republicans were saying that his veto threats are a sign of a president who didn't get the message from voters who relegated his party to minority status in the November election. New Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said the president still has a chance to change his tone.\n\n\"Tuesday can be a new day,\" McConnell said Friday. \"This can be the moment the president pivots to a positive posture. This can be a day when he promotes serious realistic reforms that focus on economic growth and don't just spend more money we don't have. We're eager for him to do so.\"\n\nAl Jazeera and wire services", "article_metadata": {"description": "Obama is expected to continue to speak about income inequality and propose raising taxes on capital gains", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=810543104, affiliate-data=10lxKx", "og": {"url": "http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/1/18/sotu-taxes-obama.html", "image": {"width": 1460, "identifier": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/articles/2015/1/18/sotu-taxes-obama/jcr:content/headlineImage.adapt.1460.high.obama_sotu_0118.1421767655831.jpg", "height": 911}, "type": "article", "description": "Obama is expected to continue to speak about income inequality and propose raising taxes on capital gains", "title": "Obama to pitch tax hikes on wealthy to help middle class"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/articles/2015/1/18/sotu-taxes-obama/jcr:content/headlineImage.adapt.1460.high.obama_sotu_0118.1421767655831.jpg", "title": "Obama to pitch tax hikes on wealthy to help middle class", "description": "Obama is expected to continue to speak about income inequality and propose raising taxes on capital gains", "card": "summary", "site": "@AJAM"}, "google-play-app": "app-id=com.aljazeera.simple", "keywords": "The middle class, Barack Obama, Taxes, U.S., State of the Union 2015", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe52f5\"", "article_summary": "The top capital gains rate has already been raised from 15 percent to 23.8 percent during Obama's presidency.\nBut the proposals administration officials listed on Saturday will likely generate significant opposition from the Republicans because they would increase taxes.\nFor example, most Republicans want to lower or eliminate the capital gains tax and similarly want to end taxes on estates, not expand them.\nAdministration officials disclosed details on the tax proposals on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the proposals by name ahead of the president.\nObama also wants to close what the administration is calling the \"Trust Fund Loophole,\" a change that would require estates to pay capital gains taxes on securities at the time they're inherited."}
