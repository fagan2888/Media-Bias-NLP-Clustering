But he insisted the operations did not contribute to an expansion of the U.S. military role in the country.\n\n\u201cI expect we\u2019ll do more of this sort of thing,\u201d he said, before adding: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t represent us entering the combat role.\u201d\n\nU.S. troops left Iraq in 2011, and remain there in an advisory role.\n\nCarter said the operations simply enhanced the effort to train, advise, and assist Iraqi forces. But he added: \u201cThey will be in harm\u2019s way. I don\u2019t want anybody to be under any illusions about that.\u201d\n\nAs we reported Thursday, the soldier was killed in a raid by U.S. and Kurdish commandos on an Islamic State base in Hawijah, Kirkuk province, following a request from the Kurdistan Regional Government. About 70 hostages, including dozens of civilians, were freed. The Pentagon said they faced imminent execution.\n\nThe Pentagon identified the slain soldier as Master Sergeant Joshua L. Wheeler, 39, of Roland, Oklahoma. Wheeler, who was assigned to U.S. Army Special Operations Command at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, is the first American soldier to die in Iraq after the U.S. withdrawal in 2011.\n\nOn Friday, Carter added he made the decision to aid the Kurdish troops after receiving actionable intelligence the hostages faced imminent execution. He said the hostages, who have since been debriefed, had told them that their graves had been dug.\n\n\u201cWe had seen them [graves] beforehand,\u201d Carter said.\n\nHere\u2019s how the Pentagon described the U.S. role on Thursday: \u201cThe U.S. provided helicopter lift and accompanied Iraqi Peshmerga forces to the compound.\u201d The Peshmerga came under fire, Wheeler was injured, and died later, the Defense Department said.\n\nOn Friday, Carter provided more details about Wheeler\u2019s actions: \u201cHe ran toward the gunfire,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said he was proud of Wheeler\u2019s actions and called them courageous.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t part of the plan, but it\u2019s something that he did,\u201d he said.\n\nCarter also added that U.S. operations against the Islamic State will focus on the group\u2019s oil infrastructure, which is a major source of revenue for the group.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Defense Secretary Ash Carter says he expects more missions of the kind that saw an American service member killed on Thursday in an operation to rescue dozens of prisoners held by the Islamic State.", "author": "Krishnadev Calamur", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "Ash Carter says he expects more missions of the kind that saw an American service member killed on Thursday in an operation to rescue dozens of prisoners held by the Islamic State in Iraq.", "title": "'More of this sort of thing,' in Iraq, Defense Secretary says", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2015/10/AP_492587429778/facebook.jpg?1445627012", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/10/ash-carter-us-iraq-operation/412204/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb45b\"", "article_summary": "Defense Secretary Ash Carter says he expects more missions of the kind that saw an American service member killed on Thursday in an operation to rescue dozens of prisoners held by the Islamic State in Iraq.\nOn Friday, Carter added he made the decision to aid the Kurdish troops after receiving actionable intelligence the hostages faced imminent execution.\nCarter also added that U.S. operations against the Islamic State will focus on the group\u2019s oil infrastructure, which is a major source of revenue for the group.\nCarter said the operations simply enhanced the effort to train, advise, and assist Iraqi forces.\nBut he insisted the operations did not contribute to an expansion of the U.S. military role in the country."}
