The main purpose of the massive piece of legislation is to provide about $1.1 trillion is government funding. But lawmakers have also slipped in several policy changes that actually have little to do with funding the existing government.\n\nFrom cyber security to sledding, here are 10 of the most surprising provisions in the omnibus:\n\n1. Cyber Security\n\nThe Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA), a bill that passed the Senate in October which appears in the omnibus in updated form, gives companies legal cover to share cybersecurity information\u2014including customers\u2019 personal data\u2014with federal agencies, like the National Security Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. While CISA\u2019s defenders say that the law will facilitate the government\u2019s reaction to hacks and breaches, privacy advocates say it essentially enables intelligence and law enforcement surveillance to collect private information without a warrant.\n\n2. Energy\n\nA provision in the package would repeal a 40-year ban on exporting U.S. oil and extend subsidies for solar and wind power. Republicans in Congress argue that selling oil overseas will create jobs and revenue in the U.S. energy sector, TIME\u2019s Justin Worland reports, but environmentalists worry that incentivizing more drilling will hurt the recent Paris climate deal\u2019s goal of slowing global temperature rise. President Obama opposes lifting the ban, but lawmakers doubt he\u2019ll hold up the entire funding deal over this.\n\n3. Campaign Finance\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had hoped to squeeze in approval for political parties to spend unlimited money in coordination with candidates, the Hill reports. Still, Republicans were able to include two riders that enforce undisclosed political spending\u2014one protects \u201cdark money\u201d groups from the IRS and allows them to continue running political ads without disclosing donors, and the other blocks the Securities and Exchange Commission from compelling corporations to reveal their campaign finance activities.\n\n4. Food and Agriculture\n\nTheir are multiple provisions in the spending bill that deal with regulations on food and agriculture. One, as NPR reports, gives grocery stores and restaurants more time to implement the mandated calorie information on their menus. Another increases flexibility in how schools meet nutrition standards in lunches. And there\u2019s a provision that may slow the arrival of the genetically modified salmon that recently won approval from the FDA, by blocking sale of the fish until guidelines are finalized on how to label genetically modified foods.\n\nSign up for and more view example\n\n5. Health Care\n\nThree major taxes in the Affordable Care Act are delayed under this spending plan. The package includes a one-year break in the health insurance tax and two-year pauses on the Cadillac tax, which targets costly benefits for many union workers, and the medical device tax. According to Politico, these three measures will take about $35 billion in funding away from the Affordable Care Act.\n\n6. 9/11 First Responders\n\nCongress initially appropriated funds in 2010 to provide health care for first responders who became sick after their work in response to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Under this spending bill those responders will receive lifetime medical care for the illnesses that arose from that time. The health care portion of the Zadroga Act, as its called, is now extended through 2090.\n\n7. Global Slavery\n\nThe package includes $25 million dollars for The End Modern Slavery Initiative, which aims to end sexual and labor slavery worldwide by funding programs, with private partners, to increase enforcement against slaveholders, free and assist in the recovery for victims of modern slavery and prevent new enslavement. The initiative was passed unanimously by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in February.\n\n8. Alcohol\n\nThe extenders bill gives temporary tax breaks to help the rum industry in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, as well as to some small breweries and distilleries, Politico reports. And for all the hipster craft cider lovers out there, Sen. Chuck Schumer\u2019s CIDER Act creates a new definition of cider: wine made from apples, pears, apple juice concentrate or pear juice concentrate can be called cider if the alcohol contend does not exceed 8.5%.\n\n9. Russian Rockets\n\nA single paragraph in the bill will allow the United States to use Russian-made rocket engines to launch military satellites. According to USA Today, Congress passed a previous law to eliminate use of the Russian-made RD-180 to punish Russia for invading Ukraine and annexing Crimea. But Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama, who pushed this provision into the omnibus, says that restriction is \u201creckless\u201d and \u201cundermines our national security.\u201d The United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Lockheed Martin and Boeing, has a factory in North Alabama that makes use of the Russian engines.\n\n10. Winter Fun\n\nAfter daring children openly defied the ban on sledding on Capitol Hill last winter, lawmakers have included a provision in the omnibus that urges the Capitol Police Board to cede to the children\u2019s wishes and allow sledding down the hill. As Roll Call reports, the language in the rider is to \u201curge,\u201d not mandate, so there is no final decision on this important issue yet, but it does show the sledders at least brought Congress to their side.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Slipped into the more than 2,000 pages of the omnibus are some provisions that actually have nothing to do with funding the government.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "From hard cider to sledding.", "title": "10 Most Surprising Things in the Omnibus Spending Bill", "url": "http://time.com/4153217/budget-omnibus-bill-provisions/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/congress-spending-bill-december-2015.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "TIME", "image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/congress-spending-bill-december-2015.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "description": "From hard cider to sledding.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "10 Most Surprising Things in the Omnibus Spending Bill"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "budget, congress, house, senate", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "omnibus, congress budget deal, congress spending bill, omnibus provisions, things hidden in budget deal"}, "article_summary": "Food and AgricultureTheir are multiple provisions in the spending bill that deal with regulations on food and agriculture.\nFrom cyber security to sledding, here are 10 of the most surprising provisions in the omnibus:1.\nThe health care portion of the Zadroga Act, as its called, is now extended through 2090.\nUnder this spending bill those responders will receive lifetime medical care for the illnesses that arose from that time.\n+ READ ARTICLEThe House and Senate are expected to vote Friday to pass an omnibus spending bill that would fund the government through September 2016, ending the threat of another government shutdown this year."}
