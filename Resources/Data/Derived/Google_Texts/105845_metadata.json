Rick Scott among women voters, Charlie Crist is launching a new ad attacking Scott as \u201cwrong every single time\u201d on women\u2019s rights and abortion rights, backed by an endorsement from the Planned Parenthood PAC.\n\nThe ad, titled \u201cExtreme,\u201d accuses Scott of opposing abortion rights, failing to back equal pay for women and undercutting women\u2019s health care, including contraception coverage.\n\nIts statements about Scott\u2019s issue positions on abortion are accurate, though some other claims are questionable. But Crist\u2019s accusations could also raise questions about his own mixed history on the issue.\n\nThe ad features several women, including lawyer and former Democratic political operative Ghada Skaff of Tampa, St. Petersburg psychologist Angela Horvath and other Crist supporters stating the accusations.\n\nThe text:\n\nSkaff: \u201cRick Scott wants to take away a woman\u2019s right to choose.\u201d\n\nLibby Burke: \u201cHe wants to overturn Roe v. Wade.\u201d\n\nMigdalia Beronda: \u201cAnd restrict access to abortions ... \u201d\n\nSkaff: \u201cEven for victims of rape and incest.\u201d\n\nMonica Harris: \u201cHe signed laws that require mandatory ultrasounds.\u201d\n\nHorvath: \u201cAnd thinks employers should be able to deny women coverage for birth control.\u201d\n\nDayana Rincon: \u201cRick Scott even refused to support new laws for equal pay.\u201d\n\nHorvath: \u201cWhen it comes to doing what\u2019s right for Florida women ... \u201c\n\nRincon: \u201cRick Scott has been wrong every single time.\u201d\n\nAnalysis\n\nThe ad is designed to exploit the partisan \u201cgender gap.\u201d\n\nIn a recent poll by Mason-Dixon Polling & Research for the Florida Press Association and others, for example, Scott won 49 to 37 percent among men, while Crist won 44 to 37 percent among women, who make up a growing majority of Florida voters.\n\nA recent national poll and focus group study by prominent GOP strategists said the party is failing to heal the gender gap, and women tend to view the party as \u201cintolerant,\u201d \u201clacking in compassion\u201d and \u201cstuck in the past.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s true that Scott has advocated repeal of the Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision and signed a bill, previously vetoed by Crist, requiring that women undergo and pay for an ultrasound procedure before having an abortion.\n\nScott also signed a law prohibiting abortions after \u201cfetal viability,\u201d the point at which a fetus can live outside the womb, usually considered to be about 24 weeks. That replaces the previous time limit, the end of the second trimester of pregnancy, or 27 weeks.\n\nThe bill also allowed no exceptions other than danger of death or major disability to the mother, and specifically prohibited any exception for her emotional or mental health. At least two legislators, Reps. Dennis Baxley, R-Ocala, who co-sponsored the bill, and Amanda Murphy, D-New Port Richey, who opposed it, said they understood that meant no rape or incest exceptions.\n\nThe Crist campaign\u2019s basis for saying Scott \u201cthinks employers should be able to deny women coverage for birth control\u201d is a 2012 lawsuit by seven states, including Florida, against a requirement in the Affordable Care Act that health insurance cover contraception with no co-pay, as a preventive measure.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi, who\u2019s elected and doesn\u2019t work for Scott, joined that suit on behalf of Florida. Scott opposed the Affordable Care Act and is a political ally of Bondi, but his name wasn\u2019t on the lawsuit.\n\nTo back the claim that Scott \u201crefused to support new laws for equal pay\u201d for women, the Crist campaign cited the Scott campaign\u2019s response to Crist\u2019s promise to issue an executive order requiring equal pay in state government and for state contractors.\n\nFive legislators backing Scott, all men, called it \u201cdangerous\u201d for Crist to suggest making policy by executive action instead of legislation. They didn\u2019t advocate any equal pay measures, however.\n\nThe Scott campaign gave no direct response when asked about the ad\u2019s accusations.\n\nInstead, it released a Web ad Wednesday of Crist in the past proclaiming himself \u201cpro-life\u201d and saying in speeches that he backed a ban on \u201cpartial-birth\u201d abortions and a law requiring parental notification for minors to get abortions.\n\nCrist proclaimed himself \u201cpro-choice\u201d early in his political career and \u201cpro-life\u201d at other times, apparently depending at least in part on the political circumstances. He declared himself pro-life, for example, during his 2006 Republican primary campaign against Tom Gallagher, when each claimed to be the most conservative.\n\nCrist has also said, however, that he has consistently preferred to avoid government regulation of reproductive and other medical issues even while opposing abortion personally.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather change hearts than change the law,\u201d he has said. He cites actions of his, including blocking an abortion waiting period bill while in the Senate early in his career, and the ultrasound veto.\n\n\u201cHe personally has his own religious beliefs, but he doesn\u2019t believe the government should interfere in a woman\u2019s right to choose,\u201d Crist\u2019s running mate Annette Taddeo said on the subject in a conference call with reporters.\n\nPlanned Parenthood PAC Treasurer Barbara Zdravecky, asked to square the group\u2019s endorsement with Crist\u2019s past, said the pro-choice and pro-life labels \u201cdon\u2019t really reflect where people are in America, the complexity of how people feel about abortion.\u201d\n\nZdravecky said she has talked to Crist, who \u201cstill says he\u2019s pro-life, but as to legislating, will support a woman\u2019s right to make her own decisions\u201d and \u201cis really clear on all of our issues.\u201d This includes sex education, contraception coverage and access to prenatal care.\n\nShe said Scott, on the other hand, \u201chas cut funding for community clinics, rape crisis centers, services for women with AIDS, testing for STD\u2019s, health services for teen mothers. I\u2019ve never seen the kind of blatant attacks on women\u2019s health care that I\u2019ve seen in the last four years since Rick Scott took office.\u201d\n\nwmarch@tampatrib.com\n\n(813) 259-7761", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Wed, 10 Sep 2014 22:25:09 -0400", "Description": "TAMPA \u00ad\u00ad\u2014 Seeking to exploit his advantage over Gov.
