Whoever takes over next year is already in trouble. The indomitable pair nailed jokes about Bill Cosby, South Korea and Sony/\u201dThe Interview\u201d all within the first nine minutes of the show. See the monologue here.\n\nWorst of the show: Ryan Seacrest\u2019s selfie stick, Jeremy Renner\u2019s \u201cglobes\u201d gag at JLo\u2019s expense.\n\nBest of the show: lots of support for free speech, from Helen Mirren\u2019s pin to George Clooney\u2019s \u201cJe suis Charlie\u201d button.\n\nPolitical messages were sprinkled through the night. In an impressive statement, Jeffrey Tambor, who won for his career defining role in \u201cTransparent,\u201d dedicated his win to the transgendered community. Maggie Gyllenhaal, who won for \u201cThe Honourable Woman,\u201d attempted to strike a political stance but ended up raising questions when she cited the \u201cwealth of roles for actual women in tv and film\u201d as revolutionary. Really? It\u2019s getting better, but Hollywood still needs to push for more.\n\nSpeaking of a politically daring bit, perceived by some as a misfire, prepare for a flood of commentary on Margaret Cho\u2019s unavoidably racist impression of a North Korean. Was that running gag offensive, or funny? I\u2019d say the later, a welcome jab at the censorship surrounding \u201cThe Interview.\u201d But the Asian stereotype she played was stinging.\n\nLike the Globes themselves, the monologue was biased toward the big screen: \u201cOur apologies, television, we\u2019re running out of time.\u201d And yet, thank the Globes for being open to little-known, worthy shows \u2014 \u201cTransparent\u201d (Amazon) and \u201cJane the Virgin\u201d (CW) got the recognition they deserve (and likely won\u2019t get elsewhere). Both CW and Amazon are first-time award winners. That\u2019s what makes the Golden Globes a fun night. Kevin Spacey\u2019s win for \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d is big for Netflix, another sign that the game has changed. Entertainment is ever more platform agnostic. Viewers will go wherever to find good content.\n\nFor those keeping score, ultimately the only broadcast networks to win awards were CW (\u201cJane the Virgin\u201d) and PBS (\u201cDownton Abbey\u201d). The big four broadcast networks\u2019 combined Golden Globes 2015 tally: zero.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "2015 Golden Globes,Amy Poehler,Globes,Hollywood Foreign Press Association,Tina Fey", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "Ostrow Off The Record", "description": "Tina Fey and Amy Poehler proved again tonight they own the Golden Globes hosting job.
