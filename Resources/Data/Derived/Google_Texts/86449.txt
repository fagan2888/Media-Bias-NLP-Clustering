You've probably read and heard about the end of retirement as we know it so many times by now that you're wondering if it's all a big marketing conspiracy to keep us baby boomers producing and consuming until we die with our boots on.

Do we really want to return to the dawning of America's industrial age, in 1910, when the average retirement age was 76? That's a tough scenario to imagine, especially when you're sitting in Sarasota where the beaches and golf courses and bike paths are continually beckoning you to relax and enjoy.

Of course, we all know the reasons why putting off retirement makes so much sense for our generation:

-- With higher life expectancy, we don't want to outlive our savings.

-- Generous pension plans and retirement benefits are a relic of the past.

-- The Great Recession came along and swallowed our nest eggs and earning potential.

--Boomers have never wanted to do anything exactly the way our parents did it.

That said, the prospect of sticking with the same-old until we can no longer pull our weight in the workplace sounds a bit, well, bleak.

So when I saw yet another study about how there are more people over 55 still hard at work in the United States than at any time the 1960s, I expected more of the same predictions that a majority of us — those who live somewhere between affluence and indigence — just need to keep on keeping on at our jobs.

But "Work in Retirement: Myths and Motivations," put together by Merrill Lynch and Age Wave, takes a different tack. For one thing, this report gets a lot more specific about what our busy lives after age 65 might look and feel like.

There's all the stuff we've seen before, about how we boomers can start new businesses and careers when our old ones wind down, and how fulfilling it can be to work right up into the sunset. But there's also a persuasive counterargument to the notion that our later years have to be an uphill journey.

The Merrill Lynch report relies on online surveys completed by more than 7,000 people — more than 1,800 of them self-identifying as working retirees over the age of 50. Then they backed up the surveys with focus groups. Conducted a little over eight years after the first boomers turned 60, it's one of the first reports to emerge with something like a template for what our post-career lives might look like.

The authors call it "The New Retirement Workscape," and it's not the long slog that I had feared. It's more like what you might expect of a baby boomer, full of stops and starts and impulses and dreams. And according to their research, it falls into a fairly predictable pattern:

-- Pre-retirement: Just as with our parents, this phase begins when you're still working, before you leave your current job. But instead of planning your mountain retreat or fishing trips, you're thinking about how you will stay productive. About 37 percent of pre-retirees start this preparation five years ahead of time, and 54 percent get serious about it when they're two years away.

-- Career intermission: This is where people are taking the break that so many of us fear we won't get. This sabbatical, which the report describes as "a chance to step away from stress and responsibility after an often strenuous pre-retirement career," lasts for 29 months, on the average. Then we become bored — or broke.

-- Re-engagement: The study found that this second go-round in the work place lasts an average nine years, and for 83 percent of retirees, the work is part-time. About 32 percent are self-employed. Only 13 percent do their jobs on a volunteer basis; the rest are getting paid.

-- Leisure: Ah! You've arrived at last in the land of the free and easy. But you took 11 or 12 more years to get there than your parents took, and you're financially better off because you did. According to this study, however, 80 percent of you will say you worked longer because you wanted to, and not because you had to.
