If floodwater rushed through your garden, some of those vegetables are no longer safe to eat. The water may have carried unknown pathogens, contaminating the food.

Cooking the vegetables will make them safe to eat.

If your garden was destroyed by any of the recent severe weather, Lewis Drug may be able to help.

Just bring a picture of your damaged garden to the cashier and you can get two free 4-packs of vegetable plants.

The offer is good while supplies last at the stores in Sioux Falls, Brandon, Brookings, Madison and Huron.
