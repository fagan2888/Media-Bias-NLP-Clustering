I mean it\u2019s true. We do speak Spanish and we practice Spanish culture. But we also come from a land that is still governed by our Indigenous relatives. I thought hard about how to politely counter argue his belief. His opinion. His Latino identity.\n\n\u201cSo I guess this means Filipinos are Hispanics or Latinos, too, right?\u201d I said. \u201cThink about it, they have Spanish names. They speak Spanish. They probably dance to Spanish music, too.\u201d\n\nHe laughed at me. He said, \u201cThey are Asians, though. You can\u2019t confuse their race with Spanish.\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly, so why are we the only ones considered Latino or Hispanic? Some of us are Indigenous, right? Think about it, papa. We are Guayakos and Manab\u00edtas. We come from family clans that stretch back for thousands of years of Indigenous tradition.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell..\u201d he stammers. \u201cI would say, we\u2019re Ecuatorianos.\u201d\n\nLatino or Hispanic is a term coined by the United States to identify Spanish-speaking people coming from south of Mexico. The reality is Spanish-speaking people from Latin America come from a variety of racial and cultural backgrounds. We are like a rainbow.\n\nHowever, since 2011, Latinos or Hispanics now start to identify as Native American, census shows. Even the New York Times features their article on the cultural change and perspective of Indigenous identity among mestizos, mulattos, and Indigenous people.\n\nAlso, Latino comes from the root word Latin which corresponds to the nations that used to form the Roman Empire: Spain, Portugal, Romania, Italy, and France. According to El Boricua, \u201c The word Hispania thus refers to the people and culture of the Iberian peninsula, Spain in particular. The term Hispano (Hispanic) later was used in referring to Spain and its subsequent New World \u2013 New Spain, conquered territories which covers most of Latino America.\u201d The white-mestizo society or descendants of Spanish relatives can claim these labels to themselves.\n\nBut Latino is not a person who only looks Mexican and speaks Spanish. Many of us come from mixed-Indigenous heritage and some of us are Indigenous, too. For example, Ecuador is home to 30+ Indigenous nations and a home to 8 million descendants of the Quitu-Shyri and Spanish ancestry. It\u2019s also home to 1 million Euro-Ecuadorians and 1.3 million Afro-Ecuadorians. However, the 8 millions Ecuadorian mestizos form part of the rainbow colors of the Indigenous race mixed with the Spanish and the African cultures. In Ecuador, we say \u201ctenemos la pinta ecuatoriana\u201d (we have the Ecuadorian look) because some of us are brown, have black hair, and some, more than others, inherit the Atahualpa face, our last Tawantinsuyu King in 1535. We also dance to merengue and reggaeton, but we blast to Indian music and do the round dance, stomp the floor, swing the skirts, and chirp like the Curiquingue and Quinde birds.\n\nEcuadorians make up the majority of mixed-Indigenous and Indigenous population, among other groups like Afro-Ecuadorians and Euro-Ecuadorians, who re-invent a fusion of all cultures, languages, and religions, yet preserve their Indigenous ethnicity, traditions, and roots simultaneously.\n\nThe Idle No More Movement is an excellent example of how Indigenous people in North America unite to stand up and fight for their culture, land, and identity against a people who think it\u2019s okay to walk over Indigenous people with mascot names and Halloween Indian costumes. I also think the Idle No More Movement should include Indigenous people and mixed-Indigenous people from Spanish-speaking nations as an effort to collaborate, unite, and support one Indigenous people across both continents.\n\nDo we call an African-American a Britannic because he or she speaks English? Do we call an Arab an Amish because he or she looks white? Why don\u2019t we call Euro-Americans \u201cmixed\u201d or \u201cmestizos\u201d because they also have Irish, Italian, German, African, and Indigenous blood, some more than others? However, there is no debate about our differences. We come from different nations, backgrounds, religions, cultures, and so forth. But the key point is to co-exist in peace and respect each other. The principle is to not step on people\u2019s sacred space without asking their permission. The Indigenous space has been repeatedly trespassed and disrespected in the Americas.\n\nI can only speak of what I\u2018ve seen in Ecuador. In Ecuador, the label Mestizo provides an opportunity for Indigenous people to climb the social ladder. In order for them to not be hated, insulted, harmed, put down, ashamed, physically assaulted, and to some extent, massacred in ethnic and cultural genocides, the ethnic label \u201cmestizo\u201d provides a convenient strategy to avoid all of the aforementioned complications. However, Indigenous people should not feel obliged to make the switch from Indigenous to Mestizo because of the shame with their Indigenous identity. Their culture is as beautiful as that of the African-American, European-American,and Asian-American.\n\nIn Santa Elena, Ecuador, we identify as Indigenous people. We go by \u201ccholo comunero,\" and some, more than others, by \u201cWankavilka\u201d to emphasize their ethnicity. The Ecuadorian government sends us a census that provides three options: white, black, and Mestizo. We are forced to put mestizo even though in our hearts we know we are Indigenous to our ancestral lands and cultures, but this mislabel affects new generations of youth who start to distance themselves from their Indigenous heritage and encourage outsiders to expropriate our lands because we do not \u201cvoluntarily\u201d identify as Indigenous. (Original Source in Spanish). Therefore, in this case, the mestizo concept does not equally glorify two cultures, but only the dominant European one. It serves to disenfranchise Indigenous people in Latin America. In a parallel comparison, there are Latinos, (Indigenous Spanish-speaking people from tribal nations in Latin America who migrate to the United States), who do not want to identify as Latinos and Mestizos but are forced to because it\u2019s the only option.\n\nAppropriating a local tribe that is not yours is also NOT the respectful manner to go about this either. However, US census should provide an ethnic label that speaks for Mexican, Central, and South American Indigenous people. This also gives an opportunity for mixed-Indigenous people to learn from their culture via Indigenous groups in United States settings. Because as mixed-Indigenous people from Spanish-speaking nations, we have a right to learn about our Indigenous past that includes everything before 1492. Our nations started way before the colonial contact.\n\nImagine what would happen if mixed-Indigenous or Indigenous Ecuadorians, Mexicans, Guatemalans, Salvadorans, Peruvians, Bolivians, among other Spanish-speaking nations re-identify with their Indigenous roots, how would that cause a chain reaction in Latin America and how would that redefine our culture, our history, and our thought process?\n\nSanty Quinde Baidal, blogger of The Quinde Journey | Wankavilka Nation (www.squinde.wordpress.com), speaks about his experience of re-identifying with his Wankavilka Comunero Indigenous identity as an Ecuadorian-American citizen in the United States. He recently graduated from Middlebury College with a Bachelor\u2019s degree in English and Creative Writing. Thanks to oral tradition and extensive independent research, Santy learns about his Indigenous culture, identity, and traditions that stretches back to 12,000 years, to the first people of Santa Elena, Ecuador.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.creator": "mazecyrus", "description": "Late last night, my father and I talked about how the ethnic term Latino mislabels Indigenous and mixed-Indigenous people from Mexico, Ecuador, Puerto Rico, etc.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Santy Quinde Baidal"}}, "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/04/05/dont-be-fooled-latino-indigenous", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/author_thumbnail_medium/public/author/screen_shot_2014-04-03_at_7.16.40_pm.png?itok=w7WCz7b3", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Don't Be Fooled: Latino = Indigenous"}, "dcterms.date": "2014-04-05T11:30-04:00", "keywords": "Santy Quinde Baidal, Latinos, Hispanics, Culture", "robots": "follow, index", "dc": {"title": "Don't Be Fooled: Latino = Indigenous"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/04/05/dont-be-fooled-latino-indigenous", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 23}, "dcterms.title": "Don't Be Fooled: Latino = Indigenous"}, "article_summary": "For a long time, we believed Latino and Hispanic correctly defined the Spanish-speaking mixed-Indigenous and Indigenous people in Latin America.\nHowever, Indigenous people should not feel obliged to make the switch from Indigenous to Mestizo because of the shame with their Indigenous identity.\nLate last night, my father and I talked about how the ethnic term Latino mislabels Indigenous and mixed-Indigenous people from Mexico, Ecuador, Puerto Rico, etc.\nBecause as mixed-Indigenous people from Spanish-speaking nations, we have a right to learn about our Indigenous past that includes everything before 1492.\nFor example, Ecuador is home to 30+ Indigenous nations and a home to 8 million descendants of the Quitu-Shyri and Spanish ancestry."}
