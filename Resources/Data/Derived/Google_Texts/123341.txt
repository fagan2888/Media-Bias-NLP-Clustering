San Diego's Gaslamp Quarter is already being transformed for Comic-Con, a pop culture convention that will be at the Convention Center from Thursday until Sunday.

Hotels near the center have been doing lots of advanced planning for the influx of customers.

Rana Kay with the Hard Rock Hotel said they've been planning for Comic-Con since last year.

"We've got all of our rooms booked, we've got branding throughout the whole hotel, parties every night. There's a lot that goes into preparing for Comic-Con and nothing else in the city compares," Kay said.

The San Diego Convention Center Corporation says San Diego hotels generated nearly $25 million during last year's Comic-Con. This year, the average room is going for about $225 a night â€” a significant jump from the rate of $165 a night during the weeks before and after the convention.

Transportation also generates a lot of revenue during the convention, with Comic-Con attendees getting around using everything from the trolley to taxis to pedi-cabs. Last year, the industry generated close to $10 million during Comic-Con.

Convention attendees also spent a lot on food last year. In 2013, visitors spent more than $11 million at restaurants and other eateries.
