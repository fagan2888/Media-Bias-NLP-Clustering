Blue Cross Blue Shield is one of the top Medicaid insurers in New York.\n\nStephen T. Swift, the insurer\u2019s chief financial officer, denied that the decision it driven by Obamacare and said that while the company has been trying to fix the failing Medicaid business for years, it\u2019s just unable to continue taking the losses.\n\nBut the cuts come at a very inopportune time for the Medicaid program. New York accepted Obamacare\u2019s full Medicaid expansion and almost 650,000 state residents are eligible for the expansion or a coverage program for children of low-income families, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nIt\u2019s also possible that the influx of new Medicaid patients under the expansion are sicker and costlier to care for than typical Medicaid patients, putting further pressure on insurance companies that have already been taking hits from Medicaid for years. Chicago health officials have already reported increasing budget pressures as newly insured patients seek pricier care than expected.\n\nWith millions more Medicaid enrollees nationwide, a trend of insurers ceasing to offer Medicaid plans is especially dangerous. New York Republican Rep. Chris Collins fears that other insurance companies are likely suffering the same losses from Medicaid coverage and more may move to drop or limit their participation.\n\n\u201cBCBS has lost money by providing Medicaid coverage for the last three years, but was able to absorb those costs with other aspects of its business model. With Obamacare\u2019s massive expansion of Medicaid, the financial impact for companies like BCBS has become unsustainable,\u201d Collins said in a statement. \u201cI fear BCBS is the first of a number of insurers who, due to Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion, will no longer be able to financially support their Medicaid programs.\u201d\n\nFollow Sarah on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Sarah Hurtubise", "description": "Bad timing for Medicaid expansion state", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Blue Cross Blue Shield in New York is dropping out of the state's Medicaid program due to serious financial losses, dropping 53,000 New Yorkers from coverage.    \"We have incurred losses in excess of", "title": "Insurer Drops New York Medicaid Coverage For 53,000 Over Unsustainable Losses", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/07/18/insurer-drops-new-york-medicaid-coverage-for-53000-over-unsustainable-losses/", "image": {"width": 630, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/2014-03-28T050228Z_1_CBREA2R0E0E00_RTROPTP_4_USA-HEALTHCARE-ENROLLMENT-e1398375650608.jpg", "height": 270}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Bad timing for Medicaid expansion state", "creator": "@@SarahMHurtubise", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/07/18/insurer-drops-new-york-medicaid-coverage-for-53000-over-unsustainable-losses/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/2014-03-28T050228Z_1_CBREA2R0E0E00_RTROPTP_4_USA-HEALTHCARE-ENROLLMENT-e1398375650608.jpg"}, "title": "Insurer Drops New York Medicaid Coverage For 53,000 Over Unsustainable Losses Via @dailycaller", "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-07-18 14:29:21", "sailthru.title": "Insurer Drops New York Medicaid Coverage For 53,000 Over Unsustainable Losses", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "keywords": "blue cross blue shield,medicaid,obamacare", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "sailthru.tags": "medicaid,obamacare,sarah-hurtubise", "sailthru.description": "Blue Cross Blue Shield in New York is dropping out of the state's Medicaid program due to serious financial losses, dropping 53,000 New Yorkers from coverage.    \"We have incurred losses in excess of", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/2014-03-28T050228Z_1_CBREA2R0E0E00_RTROPTP_4_USA-HEALTHCARE-ENROLLMENT-e1398375650608.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdcb8\"", "article_summary": "4259937Blue Cross Blue Shield in New York is dropping out of the state\u2019s Medicaid program due to serious financial losses, dropping 53,000 New Yorkers from coverage.\n\u201cBCBS has lost money by providing Medicaid coverage for the last three years, but was able to absorb those costs with other aspects of its business model.\nBlue Cross Blue Shield is one of the top Medicaid insurers in New York.\nBut the cuts come at a very inopportune time for the Medicaid program.\nWith Obamacare\u2019s massive expansion of Medicaid, the financial impact for companies like BCBS has become unsustainable,\u201d Collins said in a statement."}
