Country music\u2019s hottest stars had a bone to pick with the faulty Healthcare.gov website.\n\nCMA Awards host Brad Paisley jokingly told his co-host Carrie Underwood that his back hurt and he needed to see a doctor. Underwood asked the singer if he had signed up for ObamaCare.\n\n\u201cObamaCare, what\u2019s that?\u201d Paisley asked Underwood.\n\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s great!\u201d Underwood quipped. \u201cI started signing up last Thursday and I\u2019m almost done!\u201d The \u201cBlown Away\u201d singer proceeded to help her co-host sign up for ObamaCare and \u201cjoin the six other people\u201d who have reportedly signed up successfully for the healthcare service.\n\nThe routine had the Nashville audience clapping their hands to the tune of newly crowned entertainer of the year George Strait\u2019s \u201cAmarillo by Morning,\u201d but with the words changed to \u201cObamaCare by morning/ Why\u2019s this taking so long?/ I\u2019m going to end up with hemorrhoids/If I sit here \u2019til dawn.\u201d\n\nThe super star hosts also tried to settle the feud between Luke Bryan and Zac Brown who called Bryan\u2019s new single \u201cThat\u2019s My Kind of Night\u201d the \u201cworst song I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d The two hugged it out while Carrie told them they had nothing to fight about. \u201cYou both made great records and you're both millionaires,\u201d she sang to the tune of \u201cWhy Can\u2019t We Be Friends.\u201d\n\nThe CMA Award hosts did not stop there. Paisley thanked Swift not acting like her fellow pop star Miley Cyrus. He praised her for \u201cnot once humping a teddy bear or gyrating with beetle juice.\u201d Underwood joked, \u201cIf someone in music today was going to be caught naked licking a hammer I think we'd all thought it'd be Blake Shelton.\u201d The camera zoomed in on Shelton who nodded his head in agreement.\n\nNext up was a surprise appearance by Willie and Jase Robertson of Duck Dynasty who were joined by their wives Missy and Korie to perform a redneckified version of Robin Thicke\u2019s \u201cBlurred Lines.\u201d\n\nWhile the Robertson clan twerked on stage, Underwood and Paisley switched up the words of Thicke\u2019s song. \u201cI'm going to grow a beard and go out hunting\u2026 'Duck Dynasty' guys dance to Robin Thicke/We tried to get nasty talking 'Duck Dynasty.'\u201d\n\nThe Robertson\u2019s weren\u2019t just onstage to show off their lack of dancing skills; they also gave out the first award of the night to duo Florida Georgia Line for single of the year for their hit song \u201cCruise.\u201d\n\nThe country twosome shot to stardom this year after touring with both Luke Bryan and Taylor Swift on their respective tours. The pair also won vocal duo of the year and opened the show with Luke Bryan singing a medley of Bryan\u2019s \u201cThat\u2019s My Kind of Night\u201d and their own \u201cCruise.\u201d The two wins solidified the hip-hop country sound making its way into mainstream country music.\n\nPerhaps the single of the year win will finally put \u201cCruise\u201d to rest. The duo released the song in August of 2012.\n\nJason Aldean performed next followed by Kacey Musgraves and Lady Antebellum. Both Aldean and Lady Antebellum surprisingly went home with no awards for the second year in a row.\n\nMusgraves didn\u2019t walk away empty handed as she won the title of new artist of the year. However, the \u201cFollow Your Arrow\u201d singer displayed a face of disappointment as Miranda Lambert beat her out to win female vocalist of the year for the fourth time in a row.\n\nLambert\u2019s hubby and fellow country singer Blake Shelton scored album of the year and male vocalist of the year.\n\nVocal group of the year was awarded to Little Big Town and beating out The Band Perry, who were inexplicably ignored yet again. The band of siblings won big at the 2011 CMA Awards but have yet to win any awards since.\n\nTaylor Swift took home the pinnacle award given to those who take country music to a worldwide audience, though her \u201cRed\u201d album doesn\u2019t have one bit of country twang to it.\n\nSomber moments at the awards included a tribute to the late George Jones as well as an unusually serious Luke Bryan who sang his song \u201cDrink a Beer\u201d in memory of his brother and sister.\n\nThe highest honor of CMA entertainer of the year was given to veteran country singer Strait who announced his final tour this year. We tip our hats to the \u201cKing of Country.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"prism.subsection1": "music", "classification": "/FOX NEWS/ENTERTAINMENT/EVENTS/CMA Awards,/FOX
