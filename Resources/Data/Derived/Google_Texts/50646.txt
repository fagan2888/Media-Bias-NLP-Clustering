Since the effort to protect Browns Canyon began nearly a decade ago, there have been countless meetings to air concerns and build consensus for additional safeguards for this beautiful place.

It has been a thorough process that has resulted in strong local support for giving this federal land a special designation.

The time has come.

Last week, Coloradoâ€™s U.S. Sens. Mark Udall and Michael Bennet asked the president to use his power under the Antiquities Act to designate Browns a national monument.

President Obama should do so in short order.

We had hoped Congress would recognize the strength of Colorado support, measured by its longevity, bipartisan nature and enthusiasm of proponents, and approve a Browns protection bill.

With each passing day, that seems a more unlikely proposition, particularly considering the changing of the guard that will come with the end of the the 113th Congress.

The presidential designation would offer additional protections to 22,000 acres along the Arkansas River between Salida and Buena Vista. The area encompasses Gold Medal trout waters and important wildlife habitat, and supports a recreation-based economy.

Bennet and Udall invited administration officials to visit Chaffee County to hear what community members think about the idea.

The administration should waste no time in taking action. The designation of Browns Canyon as a national monument should be an easy call.
