He\u2019d had a rough start in life, bouncing around in seven or eight elementary schools. He wasn\u2019t always sure he was college material. Now here he was on a rural campus, where he knew no one.\n\nBut that had been part of the grand plan ever since Boldian had enrolled in Urban Prep, a new charter high school for young black men. Most were poor, way behind in school and living with their mothers in gang-ravaged neighborhoods. But founder Tim King had made a pledge: If they stayed disciplined and dreamed big, they\u2019d get into college. And sure enough, every member in the Class of 2010, the school\u2019s first, was accepted into four-year colleges and universities.\n\nOnce they\u2019d climbed that hill, though, the mountain was next. Each student approached college with his own baggage:\n\nThere was Krishaun Branch, the former hell-raiser who\u2019d flirted with gang life, left Urban Prep, then returned after a tragedy. Robert Henderson, the survivor of a lifetime\u2019s worth of hard knocks. Marlon Marshall, the soft-spoken runner who\u2019d said he\u2019d never had a real childhood. Rayvaughn Hines, the student council vice president and athlete, who grew up hearing the odds were stacked against young black men. Cameron Barnes, the lanky, shy teen still mourning his mother\u2019s death, wondering whether he had what it takes to finish college.\n\nOnce in school, these students would wrestle with stress and loneliness. Depression and self-doubt.\n\nThey\u2019d come to know the stomach-churning anxiety of getting a D on a big test. The strain of balancing classes with two, even three jobs and still ending up in debt. The uneasiness of living in a nearly all-white community for the first time in their lives. The sting of hearing your professor predict you will fail in school.\n\nThey\u2019d have to overcome all that, and more, to make it to graduation.\n\n___\n\nOn a sunny May day, Tim King sat in a Nashville church, savoring success.\n\nHe\u2019d just watched Branch accept his diploma from Fisk University, the first Urban Prep alumnus to earn a bachelor\u2019s degree.\n\n\u201cThere are times in life when you think you\u2019re right,\u201d a beaming King declared. \u201cAnd there are other times when you KNOW you are.\u201d\n\nWhen he opened Urban Prep in 2006, the school had two core principles:\n\nOne was discipline. Longer school days. Double doses of English classes. No bling, no baggy pants. Black blazers with the school crest and striped ties (a much-dreaded uniform often shed after school to avoid being targeted on the streets).\n\nThe other was the reach-for-the-stars message, celebrated every morning by students gathering in a noisy (think rap songs belching from speakers) gym to recite the school\u2019s oath:\n\n\u201cWe BELIEVE. \u2026 We are exceptional not because we say it, but because we work hard at it \u2026 We BELIEVE in ourselves.\u201d\n\nBut nobody knew for certain whether that message would successfully carry over to college. Nobody knew whether the young men would survive and thrive, absent the tough love and constant guidance they experienced at Urban Prep.\n\nKrishaun Branch comes from Englewood, the often dangerous South Side neighborhood that\u2019s home to the first Urban Prep. As a kid, he hung out with gangbangers. He quit Urban Prep rather than risk expulsion after getting into a fight. When a friend was beaten to death, he begged to be readmitted. He got serious, becoming president of the Student Government Association.\n\nFour years later, Branch still has the swagger that made him a school leader, the quick smile and \u201cS\u201d tattoo he says represents both \u201cShaun,\u201d his nickname, and Superman, his favorite comic book hero. He notes both have something in common: Invincibility.\n\nBut on graduation day, it was a fiercely proud and deeply grateful Krishaun Curtis Branch who received his degree in psychology from the historically black university. He wanted to wear sunglasses to hide his tears; his mom said no.\n\n\u201cI just feel like God\u2019s got my back,\u201d he declared, rubbing his eyes, his voice wavering.\n\nGetting through college was no sure thing, especially at first. He had money troubles. He was slow to trust others. He had a short fuse. He was homesick, but he knew he couldn\u2019t leave. \u201cI had to calm down,\u201d he says. \u201cI knew this was an opportunity I could lose. \u2026 College is a place where you have to want it. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll be spit out quickly.\u201d\n\nHis Urban Prep family, he says, often came to his rescue. They provided money when he needed it, boosted his confidence when it was sagging, even temporarily moved him out of his neighborhood during one break when trouble was brewing. \u201cI had people who wanted to see me succeed as much as I did,\u201d Branch says. \u201cThat helped me tremendously.\u201d\n\nThe school\u2019s midwife approach is all-encompassing. An alumni affairs team keeps in touch with the students by phone, text and email.\n\nThere\u2019s also limited money for tuition, books or everyday expenses. Transportation to college. Arrangements for travel home during holidays. Care packages, winter coats, clothes for internship interviews. Lawyers for legal troubles. Advice on fatherhood. In-person advocacy at school. Visits by staff to take a homesick kid to lunch or dinner.\n\n\u201cYou just can\u2019t say to a student, \u2018OK, now here\u2019s your chance to go to college. \u2026 See you later,'\u201d King says. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to keep being there to provide support.\u201d\n\nBranch hopes to pay back the favor, working as a fellow, mentoring freshmen at Urban Prep, which now has three campuses. He knows where he might have been if not for King and others who believed in him. The day before graduation, a longtime pal had phoned to offer his congratulations. He\u2019d called from Cook County Jail.\n\nJust thinking about it brings tears to Branch\u2019s eyes.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m supposed to have been dead \u2014 honestly,\u201d he says.\n\n___\n\nJust 40 miles separate Robert Henderson\u2019s South Side home and Lake Forest College, but the two places are worlds apart.\n\nHenderson left one of the poorest pockets of America, riddled with gangs and drugs, for one of the wealthiest, a peaceful enclave of Social Register families, old money and corporate power.\n\nHe hadn\u2019t heard of Lake Forest growing up, but when he saw it, he says, it was like a vacation retreat. \u201cThis is my Ha-wa-ii,\u201d he says, with a huge grin.\n\nSchool, though, was anything but relaxing. Chemistry was intimidating, but he wasn\u2019t too proud to seek help. His scholarship money fell short, so he sometimes juggled three jobs simultaneously: Security dispatcher. Assistant librarian. Campus mail clerk. Cashier at a local pharmacy. All-around helper at a community church.\n\nHenderson\u2019s bills still mounted and when pressured to pay up \u2014 which he couldn\u2019t do \u2014 he made it clear he was staying.\n\n\u201cI refused to give up and leave this college,\u201d he recalls. \u201c(I said), \u2018You\u2019re all going to have to call the police to get me off this campus. I\u2019m not going down without a fight. I WANT my education.'\u201d\n\nHenderson, 23, earned a degree in history and American studies. But his diploma came at a steep price: A $56,000 debt.\n\nUnlike many classmates, Henderson couldn\u2019t rely on parents for financial support. Along with six brothers and sisters, he was raised by his plain-spoken-but-wise grandmother, Ona, now 85. His mother was run over by a car when he was 17 months old. At times \u2014 especially at school\u2019s end when parents packed up their kids \u2014 Henderson says he found himself yearning for a mother and father to tell him they loved him.\n\nBut he\u2019s not one for regrets.\n\n\u201cWhy should I dwell on the past and play the violin and say, \u2018Somebody feel sorry for me.\u2019 Life doesn\u2019t work out that way,\u201d he says. \u201cNobody is going to try to help you unless you help yourself.\u201d\n\nHenderson tried to squeeze everything he could into college life: He joined Alpha Phi Omega, a national service fraternity, along with black, Latino and Asian clubs. He used his wrestler\u2019s strength \u2014 he participated in off-campus charity matches \u2014 to become a force on the school\u2019s rugby club.\n\nHenderson will soon move to South Carolina to join City Year, a national service group that is part of the AmeriCorps program.\n\n\u201cFor the people who invested time, money and love to get me here, it did not go to waste,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not where you start. It\u2019s how you finish. That\u2019s what I like to call resilient.\u201d\n\n___\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how many Urban Prep alumni will cross that finish line.\n\nUrban Prep won\u2019t say how many members of the Class of 2010 graduated from college in four years until the end of 2014 but King says it will exceed the national 15.6 percent rate for young black men. His benchmark for success is a six-year-graduation rate, a common standard. So far, about 70 percent of the Class of 2010 remains in school, he says.\n\nSome have quit because they couldn\u2019t afford it, others because college wasn\u2019t for them.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Inner-city school applauds first college graduates", "title": "Inner-city school applauds first college graduates", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Inner-city school applauds first college graduates", "title": "Inner-city school applauds first college graduates", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/07/inner_city_school_applauds_first_college_graduates/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/the-graduates.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Inner-city school applauds first college graduates", "title": "Inner-city school applauds first college graduates", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/the-graduates.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sharon Cohen", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4240\"", "article_summary": "That\u2019s what I like to call resilient.\u201d___It\u2019s not clear how many Urban Prep alumni will cross that finish line.\nNobody knew whether the young men would survive and thrive, absent the tough love and constant guidance they experienced at Urban Prep.\nIf you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll be spit out quickly.\u201dHis Urban Prep family, he says, often came to his rescue.\n\u201cAnd there are other times when you KNOW you are.\u201dWhen he opened Urban Prep in 2006, the school had two core principles:One was discipline.\nHe\u2019d just watched Branch accept his diploma from Fisk University, the first Urban Prep alumnus to earn a bachelor\u2019s degree."}
