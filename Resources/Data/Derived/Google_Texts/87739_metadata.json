Though not in danger of extinction, they have declined from a former high of millions 30 years ago to just about 4,000 returning to the Snake, Clearwater and Salmon river drainages where they once teemed, said Aaron Jackson, lamprey project leader for the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, to the Union-Bulletin.\n\nTribes in the Pacific Northwest use the lamprey for food and medicine, and the fish plays a key role in regulating inland aquatic systems. They spend their first four to seven years of life acting as filters in freshwater sand and silt, then move to the ocean where they become parasites, latching onto various saltwater prey, the Union-Bulletin said. After two to three years of that they return to their freshwater origins to spawn.\n\nThe Army Corps of Engineers work group that helped design and engineer the structure included tribal representatives, the newspaper said. Built by Marine Industrial Construction of Wilsonville, Oregon under a $336,542 contract, was completed in late February and is the first such installation in the mid-Columbia River, the Union-Bulletin said.\n\n\"We're excited to see something like this put in the river,\" Jackson said.\n\nRELATED: Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Reservation, Oregon", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Pacific lamprey, culturally significant to the Umatilla and other tribes, now has a shot at making it past the McNary Dam to spawn.New passage for Pacific lamprey through McNary Dam in Oregon gives high hopes for species regeneration.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/03/11/new-mcnary-dam-passage-gives-high-hopes-pacific-lamprey-153960", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/pacific-lamprey-usfws.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "New McNary Dam Passage Gives High Hopes for Pacific Lamprey"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dc": {"title": "New McNary Dam Passage Gives High Hopes for Pacific Lamprey"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/03/11/new-mcnary-dam-passage-gives-high-hopes-pacific-lamprey-153960", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.creator": "theresa", "dcterms.date": "2014-03-11T19:15-04:00", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Lamprey, Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Dams, Oregon, Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.title": "New McNary Dam Passage Gives High Hopes for Pacific Lamprey"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcee3c\"", "article_summary": "The Pacific lamprey, culturally significant to the Umatilla and other tribes, now has a shot at making it past the McNary Dam to spawn.\n\"We anticipate this prototype structure will help us learn quite a bit about what's best for lamprey passage.\"\nTribes in the Pacific Northwest use the lamprey for food and medicine, and the fish plays a key role in regulating inland aquatic systems.\nThe Army Corps of Engineers work group that helped design and engineer the structure included tribal representatives, the newspaper said.\nLampreys have been around for at least 450 million years, the oldest fish in the Columbia River system, according to the Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission (CRITFC)."}
