They\u2019re using handwriting robots that wield real pens on paper.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019re still not perfect at it. Humans have certain lovable eccentricities like dotting their i\u2019s in different places depending on how they\u2019re feeling. But robots may one day imitate even these quirks: \u201cWe can expect the robots to get better at mimicking our all-too-human irregularity. The best handwriting machines already vary some letters to avoid seeming too repetitive.\u201d\n\nWhich means robots may soon mimic human consciousness not for the purposes of, say, operating a complex spacecraft but of simply sending us junk mail:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m kind of cracked up by the fact that the most avid prosecutors of Alan Turing\u2019s sly and audacious 1950 thought-experiment have been not philosophers or computer scientists or advanced A.I. labs but \u2026 marketers. The former folks have foundered for years on the difficulties of understanding the fractal contours of human consciousness. The latter just want you to open up their damn mail.\u201d\n\nMr. Thompson references a related phenomenon, \u201cthe mid-00s wave of spambots that quoted classic literature\u201d \u2014 and I remember getting a chill down my spine when I got a spam email whose subject line was \u201cSkunk Hour,\u201d the title of a particularly wrenching Robert Lowell poem. It\u2019s hard to imagine that poem as a sales pitch for anything \u2014 and it wasn\u2019t, really. As Mr. Thompson notes, the snippets of poetry and prose may have been meant simply to foil spam filters. Similarly, a robot-addressed letter he received soon revealed itself as a fraud: \u201cI ripped it open \u2014 only to find it was an oily invitation to take out a second mortgage on my home. I\u2019d been fooled.\u201d\n\nAnd robo-marketing techniques may feel farther ahead of loftier A.I. projects in part because their goals are more modest \u2014 they need to act like humans only long enough to get a (robot) foot in the door.\n\nThat could change. In a Wall Street Journal examination of the role of chatbots in advertising, Christopher Mims quotes Ted Livingston, the founder of the chat service Kik: \u201cIf you could chat with a brand in the same way you chat with a friend, that\u2019s powerful.\u201d Mr. Mims notes that for now, chatbots on Kik have limited powers: \u201cThere is some worry at this stage in the development of the technology that a more autonomous chat bot might start saying things that could damage a brand.\u201d\n\nBut for a glimpse of the future of chatbots, Mr. Mims points to Mitsuku, a bot who can apparently advise humans on such topics as relationships, job interviews and dealing with illness: \u201cAny advertiser who doesn\u2019t sit bolt upright after reading that doesn\u2019t understand the dark art of manipulation on which their craft depends.\u201d\n\nMr. Thompson does point out one potential obstacle to the rise of the letter-bot:\n\n\u201cThe amount of upright, breathing humans who regularly write letters by hand has been shrinking steadily for years. So maybe it\u2019s not long before handwriting flips its existential polarity. A handwritten envelope will become not a litmus test of humanity but sure-fire proof that we were sent a form letter by an impersonal database. We\u2019ll sort through our paper mail with the inverse logic of today, tossing aside immediately all the letters addressed with pen-script (robot, robot, god, another one sent by a robot).\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, as in \u201cHer,\u201d we may come to prefer the nurturing love of a bot to the imperfect human variety. Will advertising bots one day be so good at everything, from writing letters to giving therapy, that we\u2019d rather interact with them than deal with actual humans? Unclear \u2014 but we have already reached the point where humans impersonate bots.\n\nI speak, of course, of Cat Facts, a prank wherein the Reddit user frackyou pretended to be an obnoxious and persistent automated dispenser of cat information. Frackyou repeatedly texted her cousin with silly factoids and increasingly involved instructions for cancellation, all of which only resulted in more cat facts. Sample conversation:\n\nCousin: \u201cShut up!!!! I\u2019m calling this number, if u don\u2019t stop\u201d\n\nCat Facts: \u201cThanks for texting Cat Facts! Remember, every time you text you will receive an instant Cat Fact. To cancel, reply \u2018chrykutfgh5764gvhtfvkigdrf678\u2019\u201d\n\nAnd now, according to Josh Lowensohn at The Verge, the developer Kyle Venn has created a Cat Facts app, which sends automated messages to the mark of your choice in the manner of the original Cat Facts prank. Says Mr. Lowensohn, \u201cThis is not, of course, a useful service.\u201d It is, however, a bot imitating a human imitating a bot.\n\nThis disturbing ourobouros may allow us to look at robo-authenticity in a new way. We often ask if robots can be as empathetic or as emotionally complex as humans. With Cat Facts, we\u2019ll find out if they can be as annoying.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20140928115602, "BN": "op-talk", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/optalk", "per": "Turing, Alan M", "keywords": "Turing Alan M,Cats,Letters,Robots and Robotics,Deeper Dive", "GBLC": "Deeper Dive", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/op-talk/Want a Robot Pen Pal?
