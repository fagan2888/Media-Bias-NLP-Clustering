Even though Congress had been preparing by doing absolutely nothing for the past two years, President Obama felt he had to make something very clear to the American people at his speech in Rockville, Maryland on Thursday afternoon: blame the Tea Party.\n\nPresident Obama began by explaining what happened to all of our \u2013I mean China\u2019s \u2013 money. Basically, the government shut down because no one passed a spending bill \u2013 which happens to be basically the only thing Congress is constitutionally required to do. So cancel your vacations to the Yosemite and forget about getting a last-minute passport, because right now the federal government is about as broke as a recent NYU graduate.\n\nThe spending bill was already a compromise, according to Obama, with across-the-board spending cuts that would have made any Republican in the 1960\u2019s swoon. Let me welcome you to the 21st century, though, where the only good stamps are postage stamps and Obamacare presents a bigger threat to the US than Ted Cruz\u2019s space-Nazi invasion.\n\nTrying to be sneaky, the Republicans in the House decided to hide a clause to defund Obamacare within the budget. The bill was sent back to the Senate, where Senate Majority Leader, Harry Reid, wasn\u2019t too happy. In his speech on Thursday, Obama called out House Speaker John Boehner for giving in to the extremists of his party. The Republicans are preventing any spending bill \u2013 without healthcare restrictions \u2013 from reaching the floor for a vote. If Boehner allowed the House to vote on the bill, Obama predicted \u201cthe shutdown would end today.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis whole thing is about one thing,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThe Republican obsessions with dismantling the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nAfter over forty failed attempts at defunding the Affordable Care Act \u2013 a law, not a bill, declared constitutional by the Supreme Court and passed by a majority of Congress \u2013 you\u2019d think that the Republicans would get the message: it\u2019s not happening. Negotiate an end to the employer mandate; try to restructure the system for exchanges; but the entire law will not just disappear by holding the government hostage. Ironically, Obamacare is actually one of the few things completely unaffected by the government shutdown.\n\nObama aimed his message Thursday at House Republicans, blaming them for the \u201creckless Republican shutdown\u201d and calling for an immediate vote. The president seemed confident that if the spending bill were to be brought to the floor, it would pass with bipartisan support. \u201cThat way,\u201d he said, the \u201cAmerican people would be clear\u201d who is for a shutdown and who opposes it. In other words, the American people deserve to know where congressmen would rather get nothing accomplished: inside or outside the Capitol.\n\nThree days into the government shutdown, the only change you\u2019ve probably noticed is all of your Facebook friends became political experts overnight. However, if the GOP continues to throw a temper tantrum, the entire country will be punished with more than sanctimonious social media rants. In two weeks, the U.S. government will no longer be able to pay its bills unless Congress raises the debt ceiling.\n\nIf the government defaults on its debts, dollars will be worth as much as monopoly money and a few closed national parks will be the least of our worries. Hopefully, a debt ceiling collision can be avoided. However, we\u2019re relying on Congress to get something done, so don\u2019t hold your breath (unless you\u2019re Rand Paul or Mitch McConnell \u2013 then hold your breath and count to a million).\n\n[Image Via]", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "NYU Local", "description": "On October 1, the Government shut down.
