This time around, they have to hit the official open enrollment deadline or face the penalty.\n\nThe elimination of the special enrollment period comes after relatively anemic uptake of the offer last tax season. Less than 144,000 people in the states served by the federal marketplace HealthCare.gov took advantage of the offer at that time.
