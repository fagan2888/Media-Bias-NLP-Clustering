The ingredients for this buffet of good will came from the home state of Senator Susan Collins, a Republican long known for her moderate views and willingness to find compromise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe seemed a fitting host for a new Republican-led Senate determined to rectify the dysfunction that has mired Congress. As senators struggle to pass even innocuous bills, Collins is emerging as a lifeline for moderate Democrats and a counterbalance to the GOP\u2019s right flank \u2014 a catalyst for compromise in a sea of intractable ideologies.\n\nCollins no longer sits in the shadow of Senator Olympia Snowe, a Republican and iconic Maine moderate who retired at the end of 2012. Collins has cultivated relationships with a powerful contingent of female senators, the largest number ever to serve in the chamber.\n\nAnd she has an opportunity this session to test her skill as a prominent dealmaker on challenging issues that range from raising the minimum wage to financing long-term repairs for the country\u2019s crumbling infrastructure.\n\n\u201cThe Senate is supposed to be the greatest deliberative body in the world, and in the last two years, we don\u2019t seem to have done much deliberating,\u201d Collins said in her Capitol Hill office, filled with home state mementos from her nearly two decades in office.\n\nThe sedate, 62-year-old senator, heralded for her help defusing the 2013 government shutdown, quickly dove into the Senate\u2019s thorniest issues after Republicans took control in January.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen lawmakers nearly failed to fund the Department of Homeland Security in February over a dispute about President Obama\u2019s executive actions on immigration, Collins introduced a bill that separated immigration from the rest of the spending measure. Her legislation augmented a broader deal that prevented a partial department shutdown.\n\nHer negotiating skills also helped break a Senate logjam this month over abortion language in a bipartisan bill to combat sex-trafficking. Collins and Senator Heidi Heitkamp, a North Dakota Democrat, proposed a method to pull the abortion reference out of the bill.\n\nThe move helped propel the negotiations that led to the bill\u2019s unanimous passage last month and broke a GOP blockade of the nomination for attorney general.\n\nIn a Senate where the loudest GOP voices frequently get the most attention \u2014 Senator Ted Cruz of Texas as Exhibit A \u2014 Democrats lavish praise on Collins as someone with whom they can work.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s been steadfast in\n\nher ability to operate independently,\u201d said Senator Claire McCaskill, a Missouri Democrat. \u201cIt\u2019s even more important now.\u201d\n\nLawmakers have started to show signs of compromise, namely by fixing a Medicare payment formula that had long vexed doctors and, in a separate dispute, crafting a role for Congress in negotiations with Iran. Bipartisan cooperation is crucial to moving legislation through the Senate; the Senate Republican leadership needs at least six Democratic votes to reach 60 and break filibusters, so someone has to meet in the middle.\n\nJohn Boal for The Boston Globe Senator Susan Collins spoke with Senator Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) prior to a committee meeting on April 15.\n\n\u201cI see my role as someone who has credibility with senators on both sides, who deals in good faith, and . . . is willing to put the time in to figure out what matters most to each side,\u201d Collins said.\n\n\u2018\u201cShe\u2019s been steadfast in her ability to operate independently.\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s a role grounded in Maine\u2019s unique stature and history. The rural state, with a strong independent streak, occupies a corner of the political landscape all by itself \u2014 a last bastion of a vanishing brand of moderate Republican politics.\n\nA black-and-white photo of Caribou, Maine, Collins\u2019s hometown, hangs on one office wall \u2013 a gift from Senator John Cornyn, a Texas Republican. Dozens of commemorative coins sit in rows near the window, memories of the military leaders she has met since first working for former senator William Cohen, a Maine Republican who went on to become secretary of defense under President Bill Clinton. An aging photo behind her desk shows Senate women posing in seersucker suits.\n\nNumerous senators credit Collins for easing the Senate past a 2013 government shutdown over the federal budget that stretched more than two weeks. Collins recalls sitting in her office \u2014 alone, because her staff had been furloughed.\n\nShe got up and walked to the Senate floor, where she implored lawmakers to work with her on a compromise. The Common Sense Coalition was born, sparking a discussion that helped end the stalemate.\n\n\u201cThe work of that group and the hours of press conferences, let me just say, helped leaders find a solution,\u201d said Senator Angus King, a Maine independent who beat Collins in a 1994 governor\u2019s race. \u201cSusan was at the heart of that.\u201d\n\nThose kinds of big breakthroughs are rare. Collins\u2019s compromises are often a steppingstone to consensus rather than the deal itself. And while she points to the Senate\u2019s 20 women as fellow collaborators, the one major issue they have united on \u2013 human trafficking legislation \u2013 stalled for weeks on the Senate floor.\n\nCollins is the senior Republican in an informal club of Senate women, which meets for regular dinners. These evenings go back years (they threw Collins an engagement party three years ago; Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, a New York Democrat, gave her lingerie). But the increasing number of female senators has made them much more influential.\n\n\u201cJust the ability to have a certain air of civility and to be able to have conversations and establish relationships, that is the basis to solving real problems,\u201d said Barbara Mikulski, a Maryland Democrat who helped create the supper group.\n\nThe first lawmakers to offer assistance after Collins\u2019s plea to end the shutdown were female senators. Women negotiated some of the most significant deals last session, including the passage of a farm bill and water resources legislation.\n\n\u201cThey haven\u2019t been a power bloc in the sense that the Congressional Black Caucus has, but it does help them build some trust across partisan lines that other senators may not have,\u201d said James Melcher, a political science professor at the University of Maine at Farmington.\n\nAnother framed photo in Collins\u2019s office shows her splattered in champagne. It captures the time she christened a boat for Bath Iron Works, a shipbuilder and the state\u2019s largest private employer.\n\nCollins, fearful of a bad luck omen if the glass failed to break, practiced in the shipyard the night before. The next day, she hit the ship so hard, the champagne covered her and nearby dignitaries.\n\nCollins\u2019s embrace of sticky situations could prove useful in a Congress that must deal with a looming debt ceiling, a contentious budget process, the potential ramifications of a Supreme Court decision on the Affordable Care Act, a sweeping international trade deal, a battle over wage floors, and funding for the Highway Trust Fund.\n\nPlacement on key committees also enhances her negotiating power. Collins heads the Special Committee on Aging, leads a transportation subcommittee on the highly influential Appropriations Committee, and sits on the health and select intelligence committees.\n\nThe picture closest to Collins\u2019s desk is a portrait of former senator Margaret Chase Smith, a Maine Republican and the first woman to serve in both houses of Congress. Letters Smith sent to Collins, then a high school senior, hang on either side.\n\nSmith, who died in 1995, was part of a breed of New England moderate Republican that has been nearly eradicated from the modern GOP. She was known for denouncing, in a speech in 1950, the smear tactics of the anti-Communist Republican Senator Joseph McCarthy of Wisconsin.\n\nCollins made her first trip to Washington in 1971 as part of a Senate youth program. Smith sat the student down and spoke with her for two hours.\n\n\u201cShe had such integrity; she always did what was right,\u201d Collins said, staring at the photo of the respected senator who shaped her career.\n\n\u201cNow I sit at her desk on the Senate floor,\u201d she said, \u201cwhich I think is so cool.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "4.0.2789953519", "eomportal-id": 392521, "description": "US Senator Susan Collins of Maine has an opportunity this session to cement her position as a prominent dealmaker on issues ranging from raising the minimum wage to financing long-term repairs for infrastructure.", "eomportal-instanceid": 29, "og": {"city": "Washington", "site_name": "BostonGlobe.com", "description": "US Senator Susan Collins of Maine has an opportunity this session to cement her position as a prominent dealmaker on issues ranging from raising the minimum wage to financing long-term repairs for infrastructure.", "title": "Maine Senator Susan Collins occupies moderate role in a polarized chamber - The Boston Globe", "url": "https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/nation/2015/05/05/maine-senator-susan-collins-occupies-moderate-role-polarized-chamber/KPtm4yRQmMnpN3M7RR8wTP/story.html", "country": "US", "image": "http://c.o0bg.com/rf/image_585w/Boston/2011-2020/2015/04/22/BostonGlobe.com/National/Images/JWB041515BGlobe_SenCollins091-finalA.jpg", "longitude": "-77.03687070000001", "state": "DC", "latitude": "38.9071923", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 95431448, "card": "summary", "site": "BostonGlobe"}, "robots": "noarchive", "news_keywords": "Susan Collins,Maine,bipartisanship,Senate, Susan M Collins, Olympia  Snowe, Heidi  Heitkamp, Claire  McCaskill, John  Cornyn, Bill  Clinton", "eomportal-lastUpdate": "Fri May 27 09:02:04 EDT 2016", "fb": {"admins": 507486035, "app_id": 103933749691726, "pages": 5637143257}, "keywords": "Susan Collins,Maine,bipartisanship,Senate, Susan M Collins, Olympia  Snowe, Heidi  Heitkamp, Claire  McCaskill, John  Cornyn, Bill  Clinton, Angus Jr  King, Kirsten E  Gillibrand, Barbara A  Mikulski, Margaret Chase  Smith, Joseph R  McCarthy,Senate, Republican Party, Senate,House of Representatives, Democratic Party, Homeland Security Department, Common Sense, Congressional Black Caucus, University of Maine, Bath Iron Works, Twitter", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/globe"}, "flashsale": "false", "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "eomportal-uuid": "4fade722-f3a1-11e4-b80f-851065fbee68"}, "article_summary": "Collins no longer sits in the shadow of Senator Olympia Snowe, a Republican and iconic Maine moderate who retired at the end of 2012.\nShe was known for denouncing, in a speech in 1950, the smear tactics of the anti-Communist Republican Senator Joseph McCarthy of Wisconsin.\nSmith, who died in 1995, was part of a breed of New England moderate Republican that has been nearly eradicated from the modern GOP.\nJohn Boal for The Boston Globe Senator Susan Collins spoke with Senator Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.)\nThe rural state, with a strong independent streak, occupies a corner of the political landscape all by itself \u2014 a last bastion of a vanishing brand of moderate Republican politics."}
