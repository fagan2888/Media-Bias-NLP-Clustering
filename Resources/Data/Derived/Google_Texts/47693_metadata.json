The killings happened amid a violent drug war between rival gangs in Southeast, the Congress Park Crew and the 1-5 Mob, according to prosecutors.\n\nProsecutors said Wilson acted as the driver in the drive-by killing of Ronnie Middleton, an 1-5 Mob member, and Sabrina Bradley, who was in the car with him when one of Wilson\u2019s two associates, Antonio Roberson, opened fire.\n\nYears after his conviction, Wilson\u2019s legal team filed a motion for another trial, citing new evidence from a D.C. Jail inmate, who said in an affidavit that he \u2014 not Wilson \u2014 acted as the driver.\n\nBut a judge rejected the motion.\n\nIn his open records request, Wilson sought a copy of a recording between Roberson and an informant he believed to be Bobby Capies. Wilson believed Roberson on the tape named his accomplices and that he was not among them. But the Justice Department refused to confirm or deny whether such a record even existed, citing privacy concerns about Roberson and the confidential source, whom officials would not identify.\n\nBut U.S. District Court Judge James E. Boasberg disagreed. In a ruling, he cited a 2011 article by The Washington Times that reported Roberson has since died, along with Wilson\u2019s other purported associate on the night of the shooting, Antoine Draine. The federal Privacy Act doesn\u2019t apply to the dead.\n\nThe judge also said the Justice Department had already disclosed the fact that Mr. Capies was an informant in the case. And the existence of the tape sought by Wilson wasn\u2019t a matter of speculation, the judge added in his May 21 ruling.\n\nAmong the thousands of pages of trial records was a 1999 police interview with Mr. Capies, in which he said he talked with Roberson and his other associate, the ruling pointed out.\n\n\u201cPlainly, the answer here is yes, the records exist,\u201d Judge Boasberg wrote.\n\n\u201cDOJ must \u2014 at a minimum \u2014 confirm or deny whether the record Wilson is seeking exists,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIf it does, DOJ must either turn it over or explain the reasoning behind its withholding.\u201d\n\nIn his open records lawsuit, Wilson said prosecutors \u201cimproperly withheld exculpatory evidence\u201d from the defense that would have showed he played no role in the murders.\n\nHe also argued that Mr. Capies was wearing an undercover wire and had talked with Roberson, but the conversation was never disclosed to the defense.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office did not respond to requests for comment Thursday, but Judge Boasberg gave prosecutors until June 16 to tell him whether they plan to turn over the records.\n\nMr. Salzberg said while the ruling marked a significant legal victory for Wilson, it doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019ll get the records he\u2019s seeking. He said the Justice Department also can refuse to turn over records on the basis that doing so could interfere with a law enforcement proceeding.\n\nWhile Wilson\u2019s trial ended in 2007, prosecutors could seek to apply that exemption to the open records law in withholding records, he said.\n\n\u201cThe government almost always responds to request whether they\u2019re filed by a defense lawyer or somebody who\u2019s been convicted by citing the law enforcement exemption,\u201d he said. \u201cI predict that\u2019s next.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Acting as his own lawyer from a federal prison cell, a D.C. man convicted of two murders has won a significant legal battle against the Justice Department, forcing federal prosecutors to acknowledge or deny the existence of taped conversations that the prisoner believes will exonerate him.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Acting as his own lawyer from a federal prison cell, a D.C. man convicted of two murders has won a significant legal battle against the Justice Department, forcing federal prosecutors to acknowledge or deny the existence of taped conversations that the prisoner believes will exonerate him.", "title": "Convicted murderer wins legal battle against Justice Department", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jun/5/convicted-murderer-wins-legal-battle-against-justi/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2012/06/18/dc-federal-courthouse-logo.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2012/06/18/dc-federal-courthouse-logo.jpg", "description": "Acting as his own lawyer from a federal prison cell, a D.C. man convicted of two murders has won a significant legal battle against the Justice Department, forcing federal prosecutors to acknowledge o", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Convicted murderer wins legal battle against Justice Department"}, "Author": "Jim McElhatton", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Law Crime, David Wilson, Department Of Justice, Antonio Roberson, Bobby Capies"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbb42\"", "article_summary": "The judge also said the Justice Department had already disclosed the fact that Mr. Capies was an informant in the case.\nHe said the Justice Department also can refuse to turn over records on the basis that doing so could interfere with a law enforcement proceeding.\nActing as his own lawyer from a federal prison cell, a D.C. man convicted of two murders has won a significant legal battle against the Justice Department, forcing federal prosecutors to acknowledge or deny the existence of taped conversations that the prisoner believes will exonerate him.\nBut the Justice Department refused to confirm or deny whether such a record even existed, citing privacy concerns about Roberson and the confidential source, whom officials would not identify.\nThe ruling in federal court in the District rejected Justice Department arguments that an informant had a right to privacy that would allow prosecutors to neither confirm nor deny the records existed."}
