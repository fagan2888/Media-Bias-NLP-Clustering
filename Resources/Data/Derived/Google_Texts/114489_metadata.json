That\u2019s where the bottleneck is going to be.\u201d\n\nDespite the inability of residency positions to meet the growing cohort of medical school graduate students, Fejiro Okifo, an eighth-semester physiology and neurobiology major, said she is has no fear when it comes to the future she imagines for herself as a physician.\n\n\"I\u2019m not afraid that I\u2019m not going to get into a residency program,\u201d Okifo said. \u201cA part of it is knowing your strengths and which programs are good for you.\u201d\n\nOkifo has been applying to medical schools since last May and said that she will make her decision by the end of this month. She applied to a wide range of schools, including UConn Health and Boston University School of Medicine.\n\n\u201cI came to UConn as a pre-med student, and I wanted to be a doctor because both of my parents are nurses, which introduced me to the medical field at a very young age,\u201d she said. \u201cAlso, another big reason is that in Nigeria, I had relatives that were experiencing sub-par care.\u201d\n\nBecause of projections showing a shortage of physicians, medical schools have responded by increasing their numbers, Nissen said, but it still takes a lot of time before the increase makes a difference in recruiting more physicians. Medical students still have to go through four years of medical school and numerous years of residency before becoming practicing physicians. This takes eight to 12 years.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think this will have a huge impact for UConn because we generally put out great students,\u201d Nissen said. \u201cAlthough students\u2019 perspectives are always that of worry.\u201d\n\nNissen listed some reasons why there have been physician shortages.\n\n\u201cWe have positions that are aging out,\u201d she said, meaning the physician workface is getting older. \u201cPeople are also living longer with many more complex medical problems.\u201d\n\nEven though the health care system is doing a better job with preventative medicine and chronic care, she said there are still more patients than ever before because people are living longer. The Affordable Care Act has also put millions of people into the system who have health insurance.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have the physician workforce to take care of that,\u201d she said.\n\nYounger physicians are taking the roles of physicians who retire, but not at a fast enough pace to keep up with the patient demand.\n\n\u201cMedical schools are certainly starting to increase in number,\u201d she said. \u201cThere has been growth in allopathic medical schools, but osteopathic medical schools have even more dramatically increased in numbers.\u201d\n\nAllopathic medical schools train medical doctors (M.D), while osteopathic medical schools train doctors of osteopathic medicine (D.O). The differences between the two deal with the way each practices medicine, but many argue that the difference is slim.\n\nStudents\u2019 worries, she said, center on questions about whether they will get the right residency or match in the right specialty.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been practicing for a while and my dad was a primary care physician,\u201d Nissen said. \u201cThe way I grew up with my dad, it was all about the patient.\n\nThere wasn\u2019t much concern over getting sued or making sure documentation was right, she said. Today, physicians are required to interact not with the patient, she said, but with a computer on which electronic records are now kept.\n\n\u201cOne of the things I would say to my patients is,\u201d she said. \u201c\u2019Listen. I\u2019m listening to you, but I\u2019m also typing. I\u2019m not ignoring you, but I\u2019m not necessarily looking at you either.\u2019\u201d\n\nEverything needs to be signed, she said. For example, paperwork with insurance companies and pharmacies is becoming \u201cmind-blowing.\u201d\n\nNow, there are medical scribes that act as physician-helpers and deal with the paperwork, but many hospitals can\u2019t afford a scribe for every physician, Nissen said. Another problem is that doctors still have to review what the scribe writes to make sure it\u2019s accurate, which also takes time and results in what she calls \u201cdouble-work.\u201d\n\nNissen, who is a graduate of UConn Health, said being a physician is one of the most rewarding experiences, and added UConn students are at an advantage when it comes to their education and readiness for medical schools and residencies.\n\nDespite this, she said 4,000 applicants, primarily from outside of the country, applied for 45 residency positions in internal medicine alone this year.\n\n\u201cI think the reason for the physician shortage is that it\u2019s competitive to get a job,\u201d Okifo said. \u201cAmerica also makes the medical school application process a lot more complicated than it needs to be.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Daily Campus", "description": "Reports of physician shortages have surfaced for decades, but recent \r\nprojections by the Association of Medical Colleges show even greater \r\nshortages by 2025, warning that the physician workforce will not be able to \r\nmeet a growing patient demand.", "title": "Residencies unable to keep up with medical schools, UConn Health says", "url": "http://dailycampus.com/stories/2016/4/21/residencies-unable-to-keep-up-with-medical-schools-uconn-health-says", "image": "http://static1.squarespace.com/static/54f74f23e4b0952b4e0011c0/54f9cb03e4b0d8458d5fcbc7/57183d69356fb02792271ef5/1461234931274/uconnhelath.jpg?format=1000w", "longitude": "-95.71289100000001", "latitude": "37.09024", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://dailycampus.com/stories/2016/4/21/residencies-unable-to-keep-up-with-medical-schools-uconn-health-says", "image": "http://static1.squarespace.com/static/54f74f23e4b0952b4e0011c0/54f9cb03e4b0d8458d5fcbc7/57183d69356fb02792271ef5/1461234931274/uconnhelath.jpg?format=1000w", "description": "Reports of physician shortages have surfaced for decades, but recent \r\nprojections by the Association of Medical Colleges show even greater \r\nshortages by 2025, warning that the physician workforce will not be able to \r\nmeet a growing patient demand.", "card": "summary", "title": "Residencies unable to keep up with medical schools, UConn Health says"}, "description": "Reports of physician shortages have surfaced for decades, but recent \r\nprojections by the Association of Medical Colleges show even greater \r\nshortages by 2025, warning that the physician workforce will not be able to \r\nmeet a growing patient demand.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe01bc\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThere has been growth in allopathic medical schools, but osteopathic medical schools have even more dramatically increased in numbers.\u201dAllopathic medical schools train medical doctors (M.D), while osteopathic medical schools train doctors of osteopathic medicine (D.O).\nShe applied to a wide range of schools, including UConn Health and Boston University School of Medicine.\nMedical students still have to go through four years of medical school and numerous years of residency before becoming practicing physicians.\n\u201cMedical schools are certainly starting to increase in number,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think this will have a huge impact for UConn because we generally put out great students,\u201d Nissen said."}
