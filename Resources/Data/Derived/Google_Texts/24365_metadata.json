That\u2019s why you see in the video the northwest side of the building fall over into the rubble pile instead of straight down.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very interesting building,\u201d Loizeaux said. \u201cWe restricted our explosives to the lower concrete floors of the building.\u201d\n\nThe building was already stripped of most materials, all that came down was concrete and iron, all of which will be recycled. Loizeaux also said the implosion caused less vibration than originally anticipated.\n\nAnd although the future of the site is still hotly debated \u2014 the Sam\u2019s Club planned for the site has been controversial since its inception \u2014 Loizeaux said his job was simply to get the building out of the way.\n\n\u201cI know there\u2019s a lot of discussion about what\u2019s going on at this site, our role was simply to clear it,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope that whatever works out that everybody\u2019s pleased with it.\u201d\n\nUpdate at 8:15 a.m.: As planned, north- and southbound N. Central have re-opened. Replay video above, with many other angles below. That was loud.\n\nOriginal item posted at 7:08 a.m.: By now you\u2019re likely aware there\u2019s a biggish bang scheduled to take place at 8 this morning along N. Central Expressway near N. Haskell Avenue, where Trammell Crow\u2019s about to implode what remains of the ACS/Xerox building to make way for that East Village Sam\u2019s Club that\u2019s sitting currently under construction in the Fifth Court of Appeals.\n\nBut if you haven\u2019t seen our two earlier heads-up, perhaps the third time\u2019s a charm lest you wind up stopped on Central or stuck in DART light rail. Both will grind to a halt \u2019round 7:30 this morning: Dallas police will bring the expressway to a rolling stop in both directions and close the service roads, while DART\u2019s going to park its trains from Mockingbird Station to the Pearl/Arts District Station until the transit authority can make sure there\u2019s no mud on the tracks (or damage to the Cityplace/Uptown station just beneath the boom).\n\nRight before the explosion we\u2019ll replace the video you see above with a live look at implosion. Then, after, you can relive it to your heart\u2019s content.
