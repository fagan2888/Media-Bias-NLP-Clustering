When the opportunity he had been waiting for finally arrived, Feiler placed first in all three of his events at the top-tier, all-classification invitational at Veterans Memorial Aquatic Center.\n\nBoulder's Christian Feiler was all smiles after winning two individual events and also leading the Panthers to a first-place finish in the medley relay at the annual Coaches Invitational. (Cliff Grassmick / Staff Photographer)\n\n\"I know who my competitors will be at state,\" Feiler said. \"Getting to race these guys was huge. It's a fun, early-season meet and a good warm-up for the state championship. I'm not tapered for this so seeing the times I was able to put up boosts my confidence for what I'll be able to do going into state with a full taper.\"\n\nSwimming with juniors Christopher Nicholson, PJ Stapleton and Mick Bartholomew, Feiler opened the Dick Rush with a first-place finish in the 200-yard medley relay. The Panther relay team outpaced Highlands Ranch by nearly two seconds, winning in 1 minute, 34.45 seconds.\n\nJust three events later, Feiler won the 50 freestyle with a time of 21.02, distancing himself from Arapahoe sophomore Griffin Eiber by half a second.\n\nThree more events later, Feiler touched the wall in 45.96 seconds to win the 100 freestyle. Cherry Creek's Sam Coffman was second with a time of 46.34 seconds.\n\nConsidered by many a contender for a state freestyle title in 2014, Feiler placed fourth in the 50 freestyle and sixth in the 100 backstroke at state last year. That didn't sit well.\n\nFeiler, who stands at 6-foot-4, 180 pounds, gave up basketball this winter to focus on swimming year-round. He will swim at Princeton next season, but hopefully not before winning a state championship.\n\n\"Ever since the day after state, I've set my goals to next year at state,\" said Feiler, who has a 4.5 GPA. \"I've been training, I've been lifting, I've been putting in everything I can to get to the next level.\"\n\nAlso for Boulder, which finished in a ninth-place tie (85 points) with Smoky Hill in the 5A team scoring, sophomore Nathan Rock placed 12th in the 100 backstroke with a time of 55.60 seconds.\n\nFor the Fairview Knights, who placed third at the 5A state meet last season, senior Daniel Hendricks placed second in the 200 IM with a time of 1:58.89, and also took ninth in the 500 freestyle with a time of 4:51.82. Sophomore Duncan Lester scored 388.90 points to place 13th in the one-meter diving competition.\n\nFairview also placed sixth (1:30.55) in the 200 freestyle relay and 14th (3:27.85) in the 400 freestyle relay.\n\nFairview finished 12th in the 5A team scoring.\n\nIn its first season at the Class 5A level, Broomfield finished 17th.\n\n\"We were really happy to get a few of our relays qualified (for state),\" Broomfield head coach Emily Austin said. \"That's big for us. Just getting some guys through to state is what our goal is this year. We know that we might not have as many qualified as we've had in the past but our goals of trying to hit best times are still the same and I was definitely pleased with how the day went.\"\n\nSophomore Austin Crump led Broomfield with a second-place finish in the 100 butterfly, finishing in 52.12 seconds. He also placed 16th (50.85) in the 100 freestyle.\n\nBroomfield placed 11th in the 200 freestyle relay with a time of 1:34.37.\n\nFollow Brad on Twitter: twitter.com/BradCochi\n\nDick Rush Invite\n\nAt Veterans Memorial Aquatic Center\n\n5A team scores \u2014 Cherry Creek 258, Regis Jesuit 235, Highlands Ranch 213, Fossil Ridge 203, Arapahoe 135, Grandview 120, Ponderosa 105, Heritage 98, Boulder 85, Smoky Hill 85, Pomona 73, Fairview 66, Lakewood 65, Chatfield 48, Greeley West 46, Bear Creek 35, Broomfield 30, Cherokee Trail 20, George Washington 19, Lewis-Palmer 17, Rampart 15, Denver East 14, District 51 Griffins 14, Northglenn 12, Columbine 7, Ralston Valley 2.\n\n4A team scores \u2014 D'Evelyn 89, Thompson Valley 63, Green Mountain 50, Greeley Central 22, Estes Park 16, Valor Christian 12, Montrose 10.\n\n200 medley relay \u2014 1.
