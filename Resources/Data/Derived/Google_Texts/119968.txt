Christmas will come a little late for some UPS customers, as shipping delays push deliveries into the day after the holiday.

UPS is not making pickups or deliveries Wednesday and plans to resume normally scheduled service Thursday.

The delays were blamed on poor weather earlier this week in parts of the country as well as overloaded systems. The holiday shopping period this year was shorter than usual, and Americans’ tendency to wait until the last possible second to shop probably didn’t help either.

Some FedEx customers are also still waiting on Christmas deliveries. However, some FedEx customers are able to pick up packages Christmas Day at their local FedEx Express centers.

“We’re sorry that there could be delays and we’re contacting affected customers who have shipments available for pickup,” said Scott Fiedler, a spokesman for FedEx Corp.

Neither company said how many packages were delayed but noted it was a small share of overall holiday shipments.

Between Thanksgiving and Christmas, FedEx handled 275 million shipments, according to Fiedler. Those that were not delivered in time, he said, “would be very few.”
