He predicted things will get worse in 2014:\n\nThe math gets worse heading into the new year. Starting in 2014, up to 80 million Americans might lose their employee-sponsored policies because those policies don\u2019t comply with Obamacare specifications. And those fortunate enough to keep coverage will still face a host of health care taxes, fees, premium increases and increased out-of-pocket costs.\n\nThe sticker shock will be felt on every level, from small-business owners who\u2019ll suddenly see their bottom line shrink or even vanish, to employees who could see their paycheck shrink dramatically as their premiums rise, or they face higher co-pays and deductibles. Or, worse yet, see their jobs vanish because their employer can\u2019t afford to keep them on anymore. We\u2019re already seeing reports of employers cutting employee hours to avoid Obamacare mandates.\n\nObamacare apologists may attempt to explain away all that by insisting these are transitional changes \u2014 even though it flies directly in the face of statements and promises to the contrary made by President Obama himself.\n\nThe truth is, these are real failures of this law, and they will profoundly affect every single American, whether they have coverage or not.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Texas Gov.
