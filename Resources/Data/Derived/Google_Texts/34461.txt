It’s a way to enjoy this weekend’s gorgeous weather and get a taste of Japanese culture at the same time.

Matsuri: A Festival of Japan is underway this weekend at Science & Heritage Park, located at 7th Street & Monroe in Phoenix.

The free event runs Sunday, Feb. 28 from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.

Guests will enjoy colorful displays of authentic Japanese art, crafts, and entertainment. Traditional Japanese food and merchandise are also for sale.

This year’s festival theme is “Momotaro.” Momotaro means "Peach Boy", who was born in a peach and traveled with a dog, pheasant and monkey. Momotaro conquered demons through his travels and became a hero of Japan.

The festival will also feature the 2nd Annual Haiku Poetry Expo. In the spirit of raising awareness of the arts and culture of Japan to the people of Arizona, the committee challenges everyone to write their own Arizona-inspired Haiku and submit it to the Haiku Poetry Expo.

Haiku poetry typically contains a reference to images of nature. They use simple concrete images of things we can see, smell, taste, touch, or feel. The best haiku poems reveal the essence of a thing so clearly that the reader can experience the momentary scene or insight that inspired the author.

Also at the festival, Fugetsudo, a popular confectionary shop in Little Tokyo, LA will have a booth selling mochi.

And there will be several Rakugo performers (a form of Japanese comedy).
