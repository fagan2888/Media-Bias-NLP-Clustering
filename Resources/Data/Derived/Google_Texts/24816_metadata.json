Lauren Powell-Smothers, CC BY-ND 2.0\n\nThe classic saying may need some readjusting \u2014 actual medicine may edge out laughter for the top spot, but it\u2019s still an important second place. A new study has found that hospitals may see greater overall patient satisfaction if they were to remove all visiting hour restrictions, as the comfort of family and reduced feelings of isolation make sterile hospitals seem a little more homey.\n\nPublished in the Journal of Healthcare Quality, the peer-reviewed publication of the National Association for Healthcare Quality (NAHQ), the case study investigated one New Jersey hospital, Morristown Medical Center, for a period of eight months between March 2012 and October 2012. In that time, 14,444 visitors passed through the hospital during \u201cafter hours,\u201d between 8:00 p.m. and 5:00 a.m. According to the researchers, patient satisfaction rose while staff and visitor complaint remained virtually nil.\n\n\u201cOur experience suggests that open visitation at both acute care and post-acute care hospitals can be accomplished with little disruption and improve the patient and family experience,\u201d Dr. David J. Shulkin, lead author and president of Morristown Medical Center, said in a news release.\n\nWhile many European hospitals have already adopted the practice of 24/7 visitation hours, Dr. Shulkin points out, the tendency among American hospitals to limit visitation sometime around 8:00 p.m. is counter-productive. Though it\u2019s usually to minimize the nightly load put on the hospital staff and ensure patients receive adequate rest, Dr. Shulkin argues patients should have more choice in whether they have visitors during night hours. Patient autonomy and personal justice should determine how and when their family visits, proponents claim, not the hospital itself.\n\n\u201cSupporting patients in a way that allows them to be with family and loved ones can be an important component of the healing experience and may reduce the anxiety and social isolation associated with illness,\u201d Dr. Shulkin explained.\n\nBut what about the staff? Surely, nearly 15,000 more visitors would make nightly routines run much more slowly, as people clog up the hallways and interrupt treatment schedules. As it turns out, a 2011 study found that nurses, too, favor the policy of open visiting hours \u2014 that is, visiting hours that run 24/7.\n\n\u201cResearch indicates an open visiting policy may improve the quality of care and satisfaction of patients, family members, and nurses in the intensive care unit,\u201d researchers involved with the study wrote. \u201cThe studies reviewed show that although most critical care nurses find that open visiting hours may impede patient care, the benefits to patients and family outweigh any negative impact to the patient.\u201d\n\nNow more than ever, the present study authors argue, family and friends are becoming patient advocates. Relatives and loved ones like to play a more integral role in rehabilitating the patient, assisting in his or her recovery as much as the bedside heart monitor. In this, the focus is patient-centered. Hospitals that have open visiting hours tend to put the patient first, which means the patient\u2019s friends and family are shown preference to the convenience of restricted hours.\n\nAt the same time, hospitals must be strategic in how they execute the policy, as security risks are expectedly higher during after-hours. \u201cBy requiring all visitors to enter through a single location and provide identification, and by security and off-hours staff cooperating to report suspicious behavior, we were able to minimize security risks,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cCalling to the patient care unit to ensure that the patient wants to receive a visitor at a particular time is also important.\u201d\n\nIn the end, Dr. Shulkin says the idea hospital staff and patients wish to have a \u201cdowntime\u201d from the daily hustle and bustle of visitors filing in and out is simply untrue. \u201cOur staff did not find this to be a reality after we did away with visiting hours. In fact, staff found that patients and families were in fact helpful in creating a calming and healing environment. So in essence this was a myth,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was no increase in workload.\u201d\n\nSource: Shulkin D, O\u2019Keefe T, Visconi D. Eliminating Visiting Hour Restrictions in Hospitals.
