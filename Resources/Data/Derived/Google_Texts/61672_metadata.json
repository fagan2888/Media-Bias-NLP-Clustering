She proves that you can enjoy life at any age and still turn heads.\n\nWendy Williams is turning 50 and has never felt better. She proves that you can enjoy life at any age and still turn heads. Facebook \"The Wendy Williams Show\"\n\n\u201cHow you doin'?\u201d Wendy Williams is doing great. The talk show host turned 50 Friday and says she will always be sexy.\n\n\u201cI want to be hot forever. Well, for me, that means hot to men at least 20 years younger than me. Men who take a second glance are so affirming to the process of getting older,\u201d she told the NY Daily News. Williams says that turning 50 is a good thing. \u201cI\u2019ve been preparing for this for years! People have told me that turning 50 can either be met with great happiness or deep, regretful sadness. Since I don\u2019t do sadness, I decided to take control of the wheel and give myself permission to just 'do me.'\"\n\nDespite her apparent strong confidence, she recalls being self-conscious about her body when she was younger. She says being 50 will only make her more confident in the bedroom. \u201cOpen the blinds and turn the lights on \u2014 this is as good as it's gonna get!\u201d she told the Daily News. So how did Williams stay fabulous over all these years? She credits good skin products and scarves to keep her skin ageless. \u201cA timeless purse, gorgeous scarves and great skin have become my thing. Clothing is nice, sure, but if I gain or lose weight, these things will no longer fit.\u201d\n\nThe New Jersey native started her career in radio at Northeastern University where she majored in communications and minored in journalism. Bio.com says Williams hosted her own urban music show on the college\u2019s radio station, WRBB, and interned for Boston DJ Matt Siegel of Kiss 108. She was always known for having a loud mouth and was misunderstood at times, but that didn\u2019t stop her high ratings on The Wendy Williams Show.\n\nNow 50, Williams is still on fire. Her show is a success and she still sports her fashionable wigs and tight, short clothing. \u201cI figure I\u2019ve made it to 50 and I\u2019ve earned the right to live by my own rules. That old hang-up some women have about long hair after 50, that\u2019s not my \u00adhang-up at all. I\u2019ll wear all lengths, but my favorite is long,\u201d she said.\n\nAge ain\u2019t nothing but a number and she proves it. \u201cI feel better about myself than I ever have in my entire life, and I wouldn\u2019t go back to 25 ever again. So when you see me \u2014 know this \u2014 I\u2019m 50 and I\u2019m fabulous!\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "wendy williams, birthday, fifty", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Wendy Williams is turning 50 and has never felt better.
