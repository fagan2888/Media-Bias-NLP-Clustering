At the same time, it took in $25.681 billion in tax revenue.\n\nThe Treasury also sold $1.648 billion in new Treasury securities--which is government debt.\n\nAmong the things, the federal government spent money on during the \"partial government shutdown\" was $1.129 billion in salaries for federal employees.\n\nTo put things in perspective, in the first two days of fiscal 2013 (Oct. 1-Oct. 2, 2012), when there was not a \"shutdown,\" the federal government spent $124.409 billion, collected $29.057 billion in taxes, paid out $2.542 billion in federal salaries---and sold $100.91 billion in new Treasury securities (or government debt).\n\nWhen the shutdown is over, the federal government will be able to get back to business as usual--and, depending on the outcome of the conflict over Obamacare between the House Republicans and President Obama and Senate Democrats--the government may or may not be able to add to its daily activities all those things that it will take to implement and pay for Obamacare.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "CNS News", "title": "What a 'Shutdown' Means: $63B Spent, $26B Taxed; $1.6B Borrowed; $1B Paid in Salaries--in Just 2 Days", "url": "http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/terence-p-jeffrey/what-shutdown-means-63b-spent-26b-taxed-16b-borrowed-1b-paid-salaries", "image": "//cdn.cnsnews.com/images/OBAMA-AP PHOTO_3.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-10-04T12:56:08-04:00", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2013-10-04T11:55:59-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-04T12:56:08-04:00"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/terence-p-jeffrey/what-shutdown-means-63b-spent-26b-taxed-16b-borrowed-1b-paid-salaries", "image": {"src": "http://cdn.cnsnews.com/images/OBAMA-AP PHOTO_3.jpg"}, "site": "@cnsnews", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "What a 'Shutdown' Means: $63B Spent, $26B Taxed; $1.6B Borrowed; $1B Paid in Salaries--in Just 2 Days"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd14a4\"", "article_summary": "Among the things, the federal government spent money on during the \"partial government shutdown\" was $1.129 billion in salaries for federal employees.\nThe Treasury also sold $1.648 billion in new Treasury securities--which is government debt.\nAccording to the Daily Treasury Statement for Oct. 2, which was released yesterday at 4:00 p.m., the Treasury spent a total of $63.262 billion in the first two days of fiscal 2014.\nAt the same time, it took in $25.681 billion in tax revenue.\nTo put things in perspective, in the first two days of fiscal 2013 (Oct. 1-Oct. 2, 2012), when there was not a \"shutdown,\" the federal government spent $124.409 billion, collected $29.057 billion in taxes, paid out $2.542 billion in federal salaries---and sold $100.91 billion in new Treasury securities (or government debt)."}
