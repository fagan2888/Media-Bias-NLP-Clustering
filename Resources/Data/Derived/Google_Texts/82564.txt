"The Daily Show" prepped its viewers for President Barack Obama's final State of the Union address, saying the President has "no more fucks to give" during Monday night's episode.

According to correspondent Roy Wood Jr., the speech will be "different."

"The rumor's that this year is going to be different. More of a preview of the exhibits in the Obama presidential library â€” the Affordable Care Act, the climate change deal, how he taught not one, but two Portuguese water dogs to fist bump," Wood said. "But what I do know for sure about this year's speech? Obama has no more fucks to give."
