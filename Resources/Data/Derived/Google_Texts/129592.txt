Los Angeles

So many flights go in and out of Los Angeles every day that the additional spring break demand has little impact on prices. There’s plenty for a tourist family to do — from touring Hollywood to visiting the zoo. There are some great beaches to visit, too, although the weather may still be a bit too cool for swimming in the ocean.
