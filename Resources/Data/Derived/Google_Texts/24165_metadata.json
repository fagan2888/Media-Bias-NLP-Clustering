She blasted Obama for telling Christians to get off their high horse at the National Prayer Breakfast while ISIS was beheading Christians across the Middle East.\n\n\u201cStop blaming the victim and wake up, Mr. President,\u201d she said. \u201cWhile Christians bow our heads to pray for you, radical Islamists want to cut off your head.\u201d\n\nPalin said that radical Islamists want a world that would \u201csubmit\u201d to them and their religion and ideology.\n\n\u201cWe will never submit to evil,\u201d Palin promised. \u201cWe will consign radical Islam to the ash heap of history.\u201d\n\nPalin said past leaders confronted evil with moral clarity and \u201celiminated fascists and Nazis\u201d and consigned Communism to the \u201cdustbin of history.\u201d\n\nShe said to \u201cmake no mistake\u201d that radical Islam is \u201cjust as dangerous as those ideologies.\u201d She mocked Obama for thinking the world can \u201cco-exist with these genocidal thugs\u201d and for refusing to even say that the Islamic State is \u201cIslamic.\u201d\n\nPalin said that ISIS is taking back land that Americans secured with their blood. She noted that Obama inherited a War on Terror in 2009 where \u201cIslamists were in retreat,\u201d but now \u201cthey control more territory than ever before.\u201d The former Alaska Governor said the \u201crise of ISIS is the direct result\u201d of the Obama administration\u2019s failure to heed the warning about needing residual troops in the Middle East.\n\nShe said America must provide its troops the political will and the rules of engagement to win and wondered how many Americans have been harmed because the Obama administration is \u201ctoo uncomfortable to give the troops the trust and the tools to win.\u201d\n\nPalin said that when \u201cevil Islamic terrorists\u201d are on the march screaming \u201cAllah Akbar\u201d from Syria to Iraq to Libya to Yemen to the Streets of Paris, \u201cit doesn\u2019t look like victory.\u201d\n\nShe had strong words for Obama\u2019s \u201cnaive\u201d State Department that, according to spokeswoman Marie Harf, does not believe America can \u201ckill our way out of war.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell that to the Nazis,\u201d Palin said. \u201cOh wait. You can\u2019t. Because they\u2019re dead. We killed them.\u201d\n\nPalin said that \u201caside from God Almighty,\u201d the \u201conly thing standing between us\u201d and the ISIS savages \u201cis the Red, White, and Blue.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the United States military,\u201d she said.\n\nUltimately, she pointed out the \u201cvirtues that set our nation apart from our enemy, you\u2019ll find them in those who wear the uniform and who pay the price for our freedom.\u201d\n\nPalin said the radical Islamists fight out hatred\u2013of jews, women, diversity and freedom. America\u2019s troops, in contrast, have always fought for the love of family, country, and freedom, she said.\n\nOn some of the biggest foreign policy issues over the years\u2013Ukraine, Egypt, Syria\u2013Palin has been out in front and her predictions have been correct.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sarah Palin on ISIS: Wake Up, President!
