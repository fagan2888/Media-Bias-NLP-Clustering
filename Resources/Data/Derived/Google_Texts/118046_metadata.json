By just about any standard, the House and Senate passed more significant pieces of legislation in 2015 than at any point since President Obama\u2019s first two years in office, when Democratic majorities gave him a raft of landmark policy achievements. The laws Congress enacted this year were not as expansive, but with Republicans controlling Capitol Hill for the first time since 2006, they were all bipartisan. The list of major congressional actions includes: The first rewrite of federal education law since the passage of No Child Left Behind in 2002\n\nA five-year, $305 billion infrastructure bill\u2014the longest reauthorization of federal transportation programs in a decade\n\nA long-term fix to the Medicare payment system, partially paid by modest reforms to entitlement programs\n\nEnactment of Trade Promotion Authority, which grants both Obama and his successor additional power to negotiate trade deals that can\u2019t be revised by Congress\n\nPassage of a $1.15 trillion spending bill, which loosens budget caps and lifts a 40-year-old ban on the export of U.S. oil\n\nA $622 billion tax package, which makes permanent dozens of tax breaks aimed at businesses and low-income individuals and families Using the last four years as a point of comparison is admittedly setting a low bar for judging the first session of the 114th Congress. As anyone paying even occasional attention to Washington politics could tell you, not much made it out of the Capitol between 2011 and 2014. The Republican-controlled House bickered with a Senate run by Democrats, and lawmakers lurched from one crisis to the next. Most of the noteworthy legislation that did pass\u2014a deficit-reduction bill in 2011, the fiscal-cliff deal in 2013\u2014were significant merely because they forestalled a calamity of Congress\u2019s own making, not because they established new law or proactively addressed a national problem. A look at what happened in 2015 and what to watch in 2016\n\nRead more And so although none of the legislation passed in 2015 matches, say, the Affordable Care Act or the 2009 economic stimulus package in scope, this year saw the House and Senate return to a semblance of normal governance. \u201cThey\u2019ve really nailed down some festering issues that have been on the agenda for quite a while,\u201d said Sarah Binder, a senior fellow who studies Congress at the Brookings Institution. \u201cAnd they\u2019ve done it in this sort of remarkably bipartisan way.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019ve really nailed down some festering issues...And they\u2019ve done it in this sort of remarkably bipartisan way.\u201d What changed? The first and most obvious difference is that Republicans took over the Senate majority. While this could have been the recipe for even more gridlock, new Majority Leader Mitch McConnell made a deliberate decision to demonstrate in his first year that Republicans could run, in his words, a \u201cresponsible, right-of-center governing majority.\u201d The imperative, as he described to reporters early on, was to lay the groundwork for the 2016 election and to show voters that they needn\u2019t be frightened of giving Republicans both the Congress and the White House.\n\nMcConnell got off to a slow start, and GOP leaders stumbled in an early showdown with Democrats by withholding funds for the Department of Homeland Security in a standoff over immigration. But ultimately, McConnell delivered on his promise, and during year-end interviews and press conferences, he took a victory lap on leading a more open and productive Senate. \u201cBy any objective standard,\u201d he said after the chamber closed up for the year, \u201cthe Senate is clearly back to work.\u201d Yet because the Republican majority is not filibuster-proof, McConnell needed Democratic cooperation. For the most part, he got it. In the closing weeks of the year, Democrats pointed out that the issues on which Congress made progress\u2014particularly the infrastructure and education bills\u2014came out of the large backlog that had built up when they were in the majority. \u201cAll the things that my friends boast about, my Republican friends, we could have done years ago, but they obstructed them,\u201d lamented Harry Reid, the former majority leader whom Republicans relegated to the minority. Senator Charles Schumer took the argument a step further: \u201cThe bills we\u2019re passing reflect Democratic values,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cEven though we\u2019re in the minority, we\u2019re passing a program that we\u2019ve been for all along.\u201d \u201cThe bills we\u2019re passing reflect Democratic values. Even though we\u2019re in the minority, we\u2019re passing a program that we\u2019ve been for all along.\u201d Victory, of course, has a thousand fathers\u2014or at least a couple hundred when a bill passes Congress. And much of the backslapping in the Capitol reflected the kind of credit-taking you\u2019d expect from members of an institution held in low-esteem by most of the American public. Democrats may have helped Republicans pass bills that aligned with their priorities, but they were frustrated that the GOP took no action to combat climate change, address gun violence, raise the minimum wage, or overhaul the nation\u2019s immigration\u2014all key parts of Obama\u2019s agenda. The final flurry of legislation came after a period of intense turmoil in the House, when Speaker John Boehner resigned rather than face a revolt by conservatives in the Republican conference. While most of the significant bills were in the works before Boehner left, lawmakers said his departure created more political space for Paul Ryan to steer them over the finish line. \u201cOver a period of time, Speaker Boehner had lost some gravitas within the conference, and Paul hasn\u2019t,\u201d said Representative Reed Ribble, a Wisconsin Republican. If nothing else, Ryan made productive use of the honeymoon afforded him by the conservatives who would raise objections whenever Boehner brought legislation they didn\u2019t like to the floor.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The House and Senate passed more significant pieces of legislation than at any time since early in President Obama\u2019s first term.", "author": "Russell Berman", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "The House and Senate passed more significant pieces of legislation than at any time since early in President Obama\u2019s first term.", "title": "Congress's Surprisingly Productive Year", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2015/12/RTR4M7V7-1/facebook.jpg?1450880150", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/12/congresss-surprisingly-productive-year/421314/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe02a4\"", "article_summary": "The first and most obvious difference is that Republicans took over the Senate majority.\nThe laws Congress enacted this year were not as expansive, but with Republicans controlling Capitol Hill for the first time since 2006, they were all bipartisan.\nThe Republican-controlled House bickered with a Senate run by Democrats, and lawmakers lurched from one crisis to the next.\nPlease consider disabling it for our site, or supporting our work in one of these waysLo and behold, Congress actually got some big things done this year.\nSenator Charles Schumer took the argument a step further: \u201cThe bills we\u2019re passing reflect Democratic values,\u201d he told reporters."}
