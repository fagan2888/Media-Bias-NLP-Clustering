party a \"clear victory\" in the country's second general election in a year and will return to power in a coalition government with the right-wing Independent Greeks.\n\nWith nearly 80 per cent of the the vote counted, the Greek Interior Ministry declared Syriza the party with the largest share of the vote:\n\nSyriza 35.5 percent\n\nNew Democracy 28.2 percent\n\nGolden Dawn 7.0 percent\n\nPASOK/DIMAR 6.4 percent\n\nKKE 5.5 percent\n\nTo Potami 4.0 percent\n\nIndependent Greeks 3.6 percent\n\nPopular Unity 3.3\n\nSKAI TV reported that Tsipras' Syriza party will form a coalition government of 155 seats with its old partner, the Independent Greeks, an agreement later confirmed by Independent Greeks leader Panos Kammenos.\n\nSpeaking to crowds in central Athens after the count, Reuters reported that Tsipras said he felt vindicated, having quit and called the election last month after his party split over his own acceptance of Europe's bailout terms.\n\nA triumphant Tsipras said that he had been given a clear, four-year mandate by the Greek people, but warned that there were difficulties ahead.\n\n\"In Europe today, Greece and the Greek people are synonymous with resistance and dignity, and this struggle will be continued together for another four years,\" Tspiras said, adding: \"We won't recover from the struggle by magic, but it can happen with hard work.\"\n\nThe new coalition government will now have to lead a people who have been demoralized by austerity, a weak economy and low employment.\n\nThis disillusion was expected to be reflected in the turnout figures for the election: Around 55 percent -- a record low according to some Greece-watchers.", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "cnbcnewsstory", "description": "Re-elected
