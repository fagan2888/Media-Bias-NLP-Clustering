Terry McAuliffe (D) against the Republican-controlled General Assembly.\n\nBut with the next legislative session just two months away, both Democrats and Republicans say that McAuliffe will have to decide how he will govern a still very much divided legislative body.\n\nSome Democrats frustrated by Republicans\u2019 opposition to Medicaid expansion and gun control argue that Tuesday\u2019s loss leaves McAuliffe free to blast the policies and politics of his conservative foes. Others say he should work with Republicans and use his coming two-year budget to build a legacy on education, workforce development and economic development.\n\n\u201cThis is a fork-in-the-road moment for McAuliffe. Does he continue to try to do both, or does he focus on one?\u201d said David Wasserman, House editor for the Cook Political Report. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt he\u2019s tried to work with Republicans, but he\u2019s also rallied with Hillary Clinton in Alexandria the day after her Benghazi hearing.\u201d\n\nBrian Coy, a spokesman for McAuliffe,said the governor will continue to make a pitch for expanding Medicaid, among other less-incendiary issues.\n\nView Graphic See the full results for statewide and local races.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to focus on things like education, transportation, caring for Virginia\u2019s veterans,\u201d he said. \u201cThose things should not be fodder for gridlock or political strife. We expect to have a productive session.\u201d\n\nVirginia Republicans celebrated their win Tuesday night, boasting of a \u201ccomeback,\u201d but when it comes to passing legislation, they can\u2019t go it alone, and they will also have to decide whether to compromise with the governor.\n\nHouse Republicans fiercely opposed to McAuliffe\u2019s priorities will continue to have the power to kill any legislation the governor proposes. Yet even with both chambers in Republican hands, the GOP still lacks a clear path to legislative wins, given the governor\u2019s line-item veto power. The GOP lost its veto-proof majority in the House in Tuesday\u2019s elections, for instance.\n\n\u201cThe governor has a veto pen, and the legislature effectively has a legislative veto,\u201d said Virginia Sen.-elect Scott A. Surovell (D-Fairfax), a state delegate who won the seat being vacated by retiring Sen. Linda T. \u201cToddy\u201d Puller (D-Fairfax).\n\nBy the same token, Speaker William J. Howell (R-Stafford) must continue to pacify hard-core conservatives without alienating the establishment wing of the party or giving Democrats fodder in a state that twice elected President Obama.\n\nWith a net loss of just one seat in the House on Tuesday night, Howell still maintains a strong majority of 66 Republicans to Democrats\u2019 34 seats, which he said he\u2019ll use to further education, health-care reform and economic development.\n\n\u201cVirginia really needs to take a look at its economic-development structure,\u201d Howell said in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019ve grown very complacent living off the federal government, whether it be military or government jobs or contracting. To a large extent, that\u2019s going away, and it\u2019s not coming back.\u201d\n\nThe message sounds a lot like McAuliffe\u2019s pitch to diversify the state economy. In fact, Howell has focused on pocketbook issues rather than hot-button social ones.\n\nThis summer, shortly after the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling that affirmed marriage rights for gay couples in all 5o states, Republicans said they would look for ways to protect religious freedom in the coming session. At the time, Howell asked Del. C. Todd Gilbert (R-Shenandoah) to review what other states have done before they decide what action to take in Virginia.\n\nFour months later, Howell said he hasn\u2019t heard much about the issue inside or outside of his caucus.\n\nInstead, Republicans say they want to unite the party in the vein of Ed Gillespie. The longtime Republican operative, who plans to run for governor in 2017, said he hopes that McAuliffe, with whom he used to spar on Sunday political shows, can avoid gridlock and work with lawmakers.\n\nBut knowing the Democrat\u2019s connection to Clinton and desire to deliver the key swing state of Virginia for her, Gillespie was skeptical.\n\n\u201cI do worry that Governor McAuliffe is going to be distracted by the presidential campaign and spending a lot of time on his friend Secretary Clinton,\u201d Gillespie said during a call with reporters that was organized by the Republican State Leadership Committee. \u201cAs a Virginian, I would like to see the General Assembly and the governor come together to address some of the concerns Republicans ran on.\u201d\n\nMcAuliffe could also try to find ways to advance his agenda without the legislature\u2019s consent. When Republicans shot down his efforts to expand Medicaid in 2014, he quietly pursued a plan to expand it unilaterally until the GOP caught wind of it and blocked him. Having failed to persuade Republicans to pass gun-control bills, he issued an executive order to ban guns from most state offices.\n\nOr, he could find ways to make legislative gridlock work for him \u2014 and Clinton \u2014 politically, using stalemates in the Capitol to whip up the Democratic base. He will face pressure from Democratic legislators and activists to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act \u2014 his chief promise in the 2013 campaign.\n\n\u201cI think our continuing failure to deal with Medicaid expansion is political malpractice,\u201d Surovell said. \u201cWe have to figure out a way to get health care to 400,000 people that the federal government\u2019s willing to pay for. . . . I\u2019ll be really surprised if the governor were to back down on that.\u201d\n\nMcAuliffe spent his first year in office pushing for Medicaid expansion, first by trying to charm Republicans, then by railing against them. After that failed, he shifted his focus to issues with bipartisan appeal, such as economic development. After plugging a projected budget shortfall with the GOP\u2019s help early this year, he acted so chummy with Republicans that Democrats feared he was undermining their case for ousting GOP incumbents in the coming elections.\n\nThe love fest did not last. The governor and the GOP fought bitterly with the legislature over a Supreme Court nomination last summer, with that animosity carrying over into elections filled with nasty name-calling.\n\nSome political observers predict that McAuliffe will try to reprise the role he played earlier this year, focusing on things that have a chance of passing \u2014 especially since 2016 voters are more likely to reward those who get things done rather than those who fight for the sake of appealing to base voters, according to Quentin Kidd, a political scientist and pollster at Christopher Newport University.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if the governor having a miserable legislative session is all that helpful to Hillary Clinton,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think Hillary Clinton can win Virginia because a surrogate wins Virginia for her. McAuliffe is not a powerful surrogate \u2014 he demonstrated that yesterday.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Gov.
