If Miami-Fort Lauderdale-West Palm Beach were a state, it would rank fifth nationally in the number of new cases.\n\nHealth News Florida is looking at how the infections are affecting certain populations in our state more than others. Starting June 18, you will meet Floridians who may or may not match the stereotypes of people living with HIV.\n\nThere\u2019s no easy answer as to why infections continue to be a problem, and there\u2019s no one way to reach the at-risk population. In the week leading up to National HIV Testing Day (June 27), hear and see our stories, and better understand how this rising tide of infections is affecting the state.\n\nMegan Milanese is a reporting intern with WUSF in Tampa.
