MADISON (WKOW) -- If you have a federal health insurance subsidy through the Affordable Care Act, you might need to write a check to Uncle Sam.

A monthly premium subsidy is determined by the estimated income a person puts down at the beginning of each year.

But as many are finding out, earning any income above that estimate means you're likely going to have to pay back some or all of the subsidy on your 2015 taxes.

It's something that wasn't spelled out by the federal government when people were signing up for those subsidies.

"Unfortunately, probably the assisters don't explain that real well when they're helping them file for the marketplace. You only have to do it once and then you'll learn your lesson I guess," said Marshall Mennenga, a Madison tax specialist..

Because the economy has improved year over year since the Affordable Care Act went into effect, most of his clients who have an insurance plan through the federal marketplace are paying some portion of the subsidy back. That can range from hundreds to thousands of dollars.

About two-thirds of 2014 taxpayers who received a subsidy through the Affordable Care Act had to pay some portion of it back to the federal government.
