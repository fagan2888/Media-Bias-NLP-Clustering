In a White House scandal that easily rivals the one attached to "Barney's Holiday Extravaganza" in 2006, the presidential pastry chef is quitting. Among other reasons, Bill Yosses cites First Lady Michelle Obama's emphasis on healthy eating, telling The New York Times:

“I don’t want to demonize cream, butter, sugar and eggs."

Some background on Yosses:

Hired by Laura Bush in 2007, when he was already acclaimed in New York for the raspberry and pear soufflés he created at restaurants like Montrachet and Bouley, Mr. Yosses began moving beyond the traditional sugar sculptures and cookie plates after Mrs. Obama arrived at the White House. He was directed to make more healthful desserts, and in smaller portions, that were to be served only sparingly to the first family.

The Times reports that he is "now headed [back] to New York with an aim to teach children and adults about eating better." And he's got nothing but praise for Michelle Obama's management style and agenda:

“She has done it with humor and good will, without preaching, just the way you would hope the ‘Mom in chief’ would do,” Mr. Yosses said. He called her “definitely an inspiring boss, a combination of spontaneity and seriousness.”

Hmm, what sort of adult wouldn't want to work for a "Mom in chief"? And what sort of citizen wouldn't want to live in a country run by pols who treat them like children?
