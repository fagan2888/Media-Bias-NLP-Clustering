You may have heard. And even though he\u2019s had the misfortune of writing down and voting on major issues for more than a decade, so far his campaign is predicated on hoping that nobody notices in spite of article after article after article after article chronicling his career.\n\nThe attempts to fake a newfound moderation on social issues have been well chronicled, but if you don\u2019t believe him, don\u2019t ask him\u2026 He refuses to talk about civil rights issues even as the Republican leadership Carl\u2019s running to empower continues going along with Tea Party extremists and holding votes on exactly those issues. It\u2019s not clear if anyone\u2019s really sat down yet and explained to Carl that you can\u2019t actually be an \u00e0 la carte Congressman, but he seems committed to trying anyhow.\n\nBut just for today, let\u2019s give him a break on all the issues that are apparently beneath him. Instead, let\u2019s jump in the wayback machine, back to when Carl DeMaio was publicly telling us that he would \u201cowe\u201d the people who pay for his campaigns. He voted several times to provide tax dollars to his donors, and then voted to give the mayor\u2019s office near impunity to distribute government contracts that his donors were competing for.\n\nIt\u2019s been a common theme with DeMaio. He also promised one of California\u2019s most prominent anti-LGBT equality activists and donors that if they donated to his campaign \u201che would not push the gay agenda issues (including same-sex marriage)\u201d like other Republicans had from office.\n\nAnd of course, he was out enthusiastically talking to Tea Partiers about \u201cour principles\u201d and assuring them that \u201cI will owe you and our collective movement everything\u201d if elected.\n\nBut why worry about DeMaio\u2019s ethics just because of a little implied payola? Sure, after he was fined by the Ethics Commission for bad ethics, he went ahead and tried to de-fund the Ethics Commission. Sure, in spite of all his rhetoric about transparency, he refused to register as a lobbyist even after being told to by the City Attorney.\n\nAnd sure, he managed to wrangle himself into essentially overseeing how the government awarded contracts to his own business. All it took was publicly vouching for David Safavian and then fretting about \u201cthe potential for going overboard with internal controls\u201d on ethics \u2014 before Safavian was indicted on multiple felonies in the Jack Abramoff scandal. What\u2019s the problem?\n\nIt could be easy to dismiss Carl\u2019s record like he wants us to, and not worry about where his priorities lie or who he\u2019s really working for. Except he\u2019s asking for real responsibilities that would impact hundreds of millions of lives, like with the Ryan Budget that\u2019s been passed this week by the House leadership that Carl is running to support.\n\nCarl has been clear that \u201cobviously I would prefer to have Republicans in charge,\u201d and now that the Republicans in charge are in thrall to the Tea Party, the Ryan budget outlines the priorities that Carl\u2019s running to support; priorities that would balance the nation\u2019s budget on the broken backs and emptied pockets of the middle class.\n\nFor most Americans, the country\u2019s top priority is getting Washington to focus on strengthening the economy, creating jobs, and protecting and growing the middle class. But what we got instead from the sharp Tea Party turn of the Republican leadership is a budget that does the opposite: It cuts the middle class loose and jeopardizes our economic future, all to protect special interests, big corporations, and the ultra wealthy.\n\nHow? Well for starters, it gives tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas at a time when we should be focused on how to bring jobs back and create good jobs here at home. Carl\u2019s built quite a career on outsourcing jobs, so this one should be right up his alley.\n\nThe budget would raise taxes on middle class families with children by an average of at least $2,000 in order to cut taxes for households with incomes over $1 million. On city council, Carl said \u201celected officials should certainly lead by example\u201d before he refused to cut his own salary and even gave his staff raises while the fire department\u2019s budget was being cut, so this one shouldn\u2019t be much of a reach either.\n\nCarl\u2019s never been much for programs designed to make college more affordable. He called for eliminating low-interest Perkins student loans (even though he was having some trouble with his facts), and said last year\u2019s Ryan\u2019s budget \u201ca good start\u201d that had \u201cgood ideas.\u201d That was the budget that would slash eligibility for Pell Grants and cap funding while inflation continues right along. This year\u2019s version would once again hack away at funding for Pell Grants and reduce the number of students receiving the aid. If you\u2019re wondering, student debt has more than tripled in the last decade, with poorer families hit hardest.\n\nBut the ideas don\u2019t stop there! There\u2019s also cutting $129 billion from Medicare as part of a plan that would \u201cend Medicare as we know it, turning it into a voucher program and risking a death spiral in traditional Medicare.\u201d DeMaio\u2019s own approach to Medicare is focused on cuts, so this should be in his wheelhouse too.\n\nAnd even though it might fall under Carl\u2019s banished \u2018social issues,\u2019 it\u2019s still worth noting that the budget targets funding cuts for job training programs, Head Start, and the STOP Violence Against Women Program in order to reduce \u2018wasteful spending.\u2019\n\nConveniently for us, since Carl\u2019s been trumpeting his willingness to challenge Republicans when he disagrees with them, it\u2019s easy to tell which parts of this Tea Party agenda he supports by simply keeping track of his silence.\n\nEven more conveniently, Carl went ahead and signaled support for the Ryan budget, so we don\u2019t even really need to wait on silence. While it\u2019s probably too much to expect that Carl would actually take a concrete position on the budget of the country just because he\u2019s running to vote on the budget of the country, he\u2019s at least apparently against people being against Ryan\u2019s Tea Party agenda.\n\nBut if the Ryan Budget still seems like a bit much, keep in mind that Carl is frustrated too. Unfortunately, his frustration isn\u2019t that it might be too extreme. Rather, he\u2019s feeling the conservative frustration lately because Republicans haven\u2019t been more proactive about these sorts of changes, and he\u2019s lamenting how many times the Republican Party has \u201ccaved.\u201d\n\nSo don\u2019t worry. If Carl DeMaio gets to Washington, we\u2019ll finally have the more stubborn, more ideological, more aggressive Republican Party that none of us have been hoping for.\n\nI\u2019m proud to work to re-elect Congressman Scott Peters", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://sandiegofreepress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Paul-Ryan-End-Medicare.jpg"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd435\"", "article_summary": "It\u2019s not clear if anyone\u2019s really sat down yet and explained to Carl that you can\u2019t actually be an \u00e0 la carte Congressman, but he seems committed to trying anyhow.\nBut if the Ryan Budget still seems like a bit much, keep in mind that Carl is frustrated too.\nEven more conveniently, Carl went ahead and signaled support for the Ryan budget, so we don\u2019t even really need to wait on silence.\nIf Carl DeMaio gets to Washington, we\u2019ll finally have the more stubborn, more ideological, more aggressive Republican Party that none of us have been hoping for.\nInstead, let\u2019s jump in the wayback machine, back to when Carl DeMaio was publicly telling us that he would \u201cowe\u201d the people who pay for his campaigns."}
