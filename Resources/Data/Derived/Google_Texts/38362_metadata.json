That\u2019s good news for consumers, some of whom have been charged hundreds of dollars for anesthesia after undergoing what they thought would be a free test. But the government guidance leaves important questions unanswered.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the health law, most health plans have to provide care that\u2019s recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force without charging members anything out of pocket. The only exception is for plans that have grandfathered status under the law.\n\nThat task force, a nonpartisan group of medical experts, recommends that starting at age 50 people periodically receive either a colonoscopy, sigmoidoscopy or fecal occult blood test to screen for colorectal cancer.\n\nMost people are anesthetized during a colonoscopy, in which a flexible tube with a camera at the end is inserted into the rectum and snaked through the large intestine to look for polyps and other abnormalities.\n\nAlthough the health law made it clear that the colonoscopy itself must be free for patients, it didn\u2019t spell out how anesthesia or other charges should be handled.\n\nThat lack of clarity allowed insurers to argue at first that if polyps were identified and removed during the colonoscopy, the procedure was no longer a screening test and patients could be billed. In 2013, regulators clarified that patients couldn\u2019t be charged for polyps removed during a screening colonoscopy because it was an integral part of the procedure.\n\nWith this week\u2019s guidance, the government has made it clear that consumers don\u2019t have to pick up the tab for anesthesia during a colonoscopy either.\n\nBut other questions remain. Consumers may still find themselves on the hook for facility or pathology charges related to a screening colonoscopy, according to an email from Anna Howard, a policy principal at the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, and Mary Doroshenk, director of the National Colorectal Cancer Roundtable.\n\nIn addition, cost sharing rules are unclear for consumers who get a positive result on a blood stool test and need to follow up with a colonoscopy. The federal government hasn\u2019t clarified whether that procedure is considered part of the free screening process or whether insurers can charge for it as a diagnostic procedure, Howard and Doroshenk say.\n\nIn a 2012 study, researchers found that four insurers imposed patient cost sharing for colonoscopies after a positive blood stool test and three did not.\n\nAs for consumers who paid for anesthesia and now learn that they shouldn\u2019t have been charged, it\u2019s unclear if they can get their money back.\n\n\u201cOur expectation is that those who have received a bill for anesthesia this plan year may be able to appeal, but not for previous years,\u201d Howard and Doroshenk said.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services didn\u2019t respond to a request for clarification.\n\n\u2013Michelle Andrews, Kaiser Health News", "article_metadata": {"description": "Insurers can\u2019t bill for anesthesia administered during free colonoscopies to screen for colorectal cancer, the federal government clarified this week.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "FlaglerLive", "description": "Although the ACA health law made it clear that the colonoscopy itself must be free for patients, it didn\u2019t spell out how anesthesia or other charges should be handled.", "title": "One Way to Lessen That Pain: Insurers May Not Charge for Anesthesia in Colonoscopies |FlaglerLive", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 650, "identifier": "http://flaglerlive.com/wp-content/uploads/colonoscopy-anesthesia.jpg", "height": 488}, "updated_time": "2015-05-17T14:37:08-04:00", "url": "http://flaglerlive.com/78785/colonoscopies-anesthesia/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://flaglerlive.com/wp-content/uploads/colonoscopy-anesthesia.jpg", "description": "Insurers can\u2019t bill for anesthesia administered during free colonoscopies to screen for colorectal cancer, the federal government clarified this week.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Insurers May Not Charge for Anesthesia in Colonoscopies"}, "robots": "noodp", "framework": "Alkivia Framework 0.9", "fb": {"app_id": 116656355016711}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://flaglerlive.com/wp-content/uploads/cropped-FlaglerLive-270x270.jpg", "article": {"section": "Backgrounders", "tag": "obamacare", "published_time": "2015-05-17T14:37:01-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-17T14:37:08-04:00"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc43c\"", "article_summary": "Earlier this week the federal government clarified that insurers can\u2019t charge people for anesthesia administered during a free colonoscopy to screen for colorectal cancer.\nThe federal government hasn\u2019t clarified whether that procedure is considered part of the free screening process or whether insurers can charge for it as a diagnostic procedure, Howard and Doroshenk say.\nThat\u2019s good news for consumers, some of whom have been charged hundreds of dollars for anesthesia after undergoing what they thought would be a free test.\nIn a 2012 study, researchers found that four insurers imposed patient cost sharing for colonoscopies after a positive blood stool test and three did not.\nIn 2013, regulators clarified that patients couldn\u2019t be charged for polyps removed during a screening colonoscopy because it was an integral part of the procedure."}
