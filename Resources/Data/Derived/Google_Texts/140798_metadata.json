Hamidou, who fled the country last year and now works in New York as a computer developer, was one of the first to take to the streets in his hometown of Kafranbel, in the northwest, in early 2011. But with regime aircraft pummeling his town and al-Qaeda-linked fighters periodically overrunning Kafranbel to kidnap civil-society activists like himself, the 29-year-old finagled a visa to the U.S. and escaped. His family and girlfriend remain in Syria, but he says there is no role for him there anymore. \u201cThe revolution started with the peaceful activists, we had no intention to hold a gun and fight anybody. What we wanted was freedom\u2014how did we get here?\u201d he asks. \u201cActivists are vanishing, my revolution is being stolen, and those martyrs, this blood, all for nothing. It\u2019s gonna be worthless, in vain.\u201d\n\nNowadays, his activism takes place on his computer, as it did before the revolution broke out. Like many towns in Syria, Kafranbel has a Local Coordination Committee (LCC) and media center page on Facebook, both of which are used to spread news of the revolution, document the dead, and distribute safety information to residents. In a country where foreign and independent Syrian journalists are barred, and the regime\u2019s expansive network of citizen-spies makes public discussion of the revolution dangerous to this day, Facebook was one of the first refuges for Syria\u2019s dissidents\u2014and now it has become one of their last. While al-Ahmed acknowledges the group\u2019s content is often \u201cdifficult,\u201d so is Syria\u2019s war. Which is why the social network\u2019s recent decisions to shut down dozens of opposition pages, including the Kafranbel Media Center that Hamidou administered in exile, have dealt a significant blow to peaceful activists who have grown reliant on Facebook for communication and uncensored\u2014if bloody and graphic\u2014reporting on the war\u2019s atrocities. It\u2019s only the latest chapter in Syria\u2019s well-documented Facebook wars, but it threatens to be the final one for the non-violent voices who sparked the revolution to upend 40 years of oppressive Assad family rule. The SecDev Foundation, a Canadian NGO that runs several digital-security initiatives in Syria\u2014 distributing censorship-circumvention tools like VPNs and proxies, and warning about pro-regime hacking schemes\u2014has compiled a list of dozens of pages belonging to opposition citizen-journalism outfits or non-aligned NGOs that have reportedly been shuttered since last fall for posting what Facebook deemed to be graphic imagery or calls to violence. These pages often resurface under different URLs with a fraction of the followers they had before, and sometimes continue operating as they had previously. Screenshots taken by SecDev or sent to the group by page administrators capture what appear to be some baffling decisions by Facebook. Take the case of the Daraa al-Mahata LCC. Its page, which documents the violence in Syria\u2019s southernmost city of Daraa, had over 42,000 \u201clikes\u201d when it was removed in October for posting a picture of a man allegedly killed by the Syrian Army. In the picture, Fadi Badr al-Miqdad sits comfortably\u2014very much alive\u2014in a beige armchair. A young child, also alive, is perched on his lap. The Arabic-language caption reads: \u201cHe was killed by shabiha gangs in [the town of] Busra al-Sham.\u201d Shabiha, loosely translated as \u201cthugs,\u201d is a pejorative term used by both sides in the conflict to describe their enemies\u2014and the only potentially offensive word in the post.\n\nThe page\u2019s administrators, who unsuccessfully appealed to have the page restored, do not understand. Why this picture? And, after nearly three years of posting images of dead bodies (among other things), why now? Activists point to Facebook\u2019s open-ended community standards and reporting system in explaining these closures. Any user who believes a post or photograph violates the social network\u2019s standards may lodge the complaint with the company\u2019s user-operations team, whose Arabic-language unit, operating out of Dublin, can then choose to remove the content, warn the page\u2019s administrators, or even close the page, sometimes without notice. Activists believe groups supportive of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad are gaming the system and reporting on their rivals. Facebook does not disclose information about who reported whom, making it impossible to confirm these theories. But the pro-Assad Syrian Electronic Army (SEA)\u2014best known for its hacks of major news sites, including an infamous White House bomb hoax that sank the Dow 140 points\u2014has publicly gloated about this tactic. \u201cWe continue our reporting attacks,\u201d read a typical post from December 9 on the SEA\u2019s Facebook page. \u201cOur next target is the Local Coordination Committee of Barzeh [a neighborhood in Damascus], the page that is a partner in shedding Syrian blood and provoking sectarian division.\u201d It then provided two links to photos on the Barzeh page that could get the page taken down. Soon afterwards, the SEA removed its post as if it had never existed. Though SEA campaigns aren\u2019t always successful\u2014Facebook says the \u201cquality\u201d of reports will always trump the \u201cquantity\u201d\u2014activists believe the pro-Assad hackers have claimed some high-profile scalps in recent months. Among them is the London-based Syrian Network for Human Rights, an NGO that documents casualties and rights abuses in the civil war. The SNHR has been regularly sharing graphic images\u2014from blood-spattered streets to mutilated bodies\u2014since 2011, but in October, Facebook reportedly pulled the plug on its page. With the UN announcing in January that it will no longer keep track of Syria\u2019s rising death count, citing an inability to verify information inside Syria, the world will depend on NGOs like SNHR for updates. Without an operating Facebook page, its reach will be thwarted. Human rights groups are preparing files so that war criminals can be brought to justice. When a page is shut down, those files are gone. LCC and media-center pages are ripe for the picking because they have long prided themselves on depicting the war in all its gory detail. Graphic content, like that posted by SNHR, would indeed upset many of Facebook\u2019s more than 1 billion users, all of whom can access public groups. But the owners of these pages insist their content is not meant to offend. \u201cThis is all \u2026 part of telling people what is happening in Syria,\u201d said Bassam al-Ahmad, the Istanbul-based spokesman for the Violations Documentation Center. His organization and others that track human-rights violations are preparing files so that war criminals can be brought to justice in a theoretical post-Assad Syria. When a page is shut down, those files are gone. And while al-Ahmed acknowledged the group\u2019s content is often \u201cdifficult,\u201d so is Syria\u2019s war.\n\n\u201cI blame Facebook 100 percent for the closures,\u201d said Dlshad Othman, a Syrian digital-security expert and cyberactivist, in a phone interview from his home in Washington, D.C. \u201cThey opened the door from the beginning, letting all the people use Facebook above all other networks and then they shut down their pages. Facebook was a trap for us.\u201d Richard Allan, Facebook\u2019s director of public policy for Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, acknowledged Facebook\u2019s community-policed reporting apparatus isn\u2019t perfect and that human error can creep into decisions on page violations. He also noted that his team is dealing with an unprecedented conflict. \u201cWith Syria, there are situations where it\u2019s very hard for us to get the rules just right,\u201d Allan said. \u201cThe funny thing,\u201d Othman mused, \u201cis that Facebook used to be proud that it was part of the Arab Spring.\u201d In a letter to potential investors when Facebook filed its IPO last February, founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg touted his social network\u2019s role in undermining tyrannical governments like Syria\u2019s: \u201cBy giving people the power to share, we are starting to see people make their voices heard on a different scale from what has historically been possible. These voices will increase in number and volume. They cannot be ignored.\u201d Unless, of course, they are deleted by Facebook itself. While Allan declined to comment on individual cases, the company said nothing has changed in its policy with regard to the Syrian conflict. Allan instead suggested that years of content breach may have finally caught up to pages that have been around since early 2011. In other words, it was only a matter of time. \u201cThere comes a point at which a page has breached the rules so many times that the only choice we have left is to close it,\u201d said Allan in a phone interview from London. \u201cWe don\u2019t like to take that sanction, it\u2019s not our first option \u2026 but if a page repeatedly breaches then it\u2019s going to hit that threshold.\u201d He added, however, that Facebook\u2019s decisions are \u201cbased on the quality of the content, not the quantity of reporting. One report about bad content, it will come down. A thousand reports about good content, it won\u2019t come down.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t a satisfying answer for activists like Razan Zaitouneh, one of the founders of the LCC system as well as the Violations Documentation Center. In early December, according to SecDev, the famed human-rights lawyer drafted a letter to Facebook imploring policy officials to consider that human-rights groups like her own have nowhere else to go. An exception should be made for those merely seeking to document conflict, she said. \u201cFacebook pages are the only outlet that allows Syrians and media activists to convey the events and atrocities in Syria to the world,\u201d she wrote in the letter, which was shared by SecDev. \"We strongly appeal to you not to make it easier for the Syrian regime to terminate calls for freedom and dignity.\u201d Zaitouneh never got a response to her letter. On December 9, five men stormed her organization\u2019s office in the Damascus suburb of Douma and kidnapped her, along with her husband and two colleagues, VDC spokesman al-Ahmad said. Their whereabouts and kidnappers are unknown, but the abduction is widely believed to be the work of an Islamist rebel group, the Army of Islam, which is active in an area that was \u201cliberated\u201d from Assad\u2019s grips months ago. Al-Ahmad said Zaitouneh had received threatening letters from an Islamist group shortly before the kidnapping, but he refused to name the group without proper evidence. Zaitouneh\u2019s kidnapping\u2014and specifically the fact that it appears to have been perpetrated by \u2018anti-Assad\u2019 rebel fighters, underlines the bleak reality facing Syria\u2019s non-violent holdouts, who bravely took to the streets in protest three years and 130,000 lives ago. With Assad showing no signs of wavering and al-Qaeda-linked extremists streaming across Syria\u2019s porous borders, the peaceful protesters say they no longer recognize the uprising they used to lead. \u201cIt\u2019s no secret that the role of activists in Syria is dwindling,\u201d said Laila Safadi, the editor of the online opposition news magazine Tala\u2019na al-Hurriya (\u201cTake Us to Freedom\u201d) from her home in the Golan Heights in Syria. That means Facebook is more important than ever, Safadi said. She feels that Facebook does not provide enough warning to page administrators to clean up their content before shutting down pages. The Internet in Syria is slow and unreliable, and pages that have been operating for years have amassed huge quantities of data that are not easy to comb through in time to respond to concerns.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Social media was one of the first refuges for Syria\u2019s non-violent activists.
