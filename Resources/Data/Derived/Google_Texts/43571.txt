KPBS media partner 10News has learned that Salvatore Belvedere, the second victim shot outside a Mission Valley shopping mall on Christmas Eve, has died from his injuries.

The 22-year-old and his brother's fiancee, Ilona Flint, 22, were found in a car in the parking lot at Macy's at the Westfield Mission Valley Mall after both being shot about 1:30 a.m., police said.

Flint was able to call 911 before dying in the vehicle at the scene.

Belvedere was rushed to Scripps Mercy Hospital and treated for a head wound, but succumbed to his injuries.

Police said they want to question Gianni Belvedere, the brother of the male victim and Flint's fiance, in connection to the shooting. He was last seen about 10 p.m. Monday in Tierrasanta.

His family pleaded Thursday for him to come forward.

"We need you right now, please call us," Salvatore and Gianni's sister, Antoinette Belvedere, said at a news conference.

"It does not appear that any sort of robbery took place," Lt. Mike Hastings of the San Diego Police Departments homicide unit said. "We still do not know a motive as to why this occurred."

Police investigators continued their forensic investigation of the four-door, black 2004 Toyota Camry XLE with Utah license plates in which Belvedere and Flint were found at the mall.

A possible suspect -- described only as a man up to about 5-feet-11-inches in tan pants -- might have fled in a dark gray 2008-2011 Honda, police said.

Hastings urged anyone with information on the case to call the SDPD homicide unit adult missing person's section at 619-531-2293 or Crime Stoppers anonymous tip line at 888-580-8477.
