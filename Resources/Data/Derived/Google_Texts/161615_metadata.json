That sounds like the normal American family enjoying one of our great holidays. This however defeats the vision of the American family that the Obama Administration and the Democratic National Committee share.\n\nIn the days before Thanksgiving, they issued their annual talking points on how to deal with what deemed \u201cYour Republican Uncle.\u201d They had talking points to drive home the idea that America is flourishing with Obamacare and a great economy. They even had points to attack every Republican candidate. Can you imagine people actually using a great holiday to argue Ted Cruz\u2019s position on some trade policy?\n\nI think my Thanksgiving experience was much more that of the average American. We went to Roe\u2019s relatives and talked about the miserable game played by the Eagles, family updates, who had to work on Black Friday and Roe\u2019s car being stolen.\n\nThe highlight of the dinner was the Brussel sprouts. They were great and I raved about them, and the two women who had cooked them in a pleasing way were thrilled. I promised to mention them on the next radio show.\n\nI did that on Friday and immediately I\u2019ve been crushed by demands for the recipe. Here is the recipe: Get 1 lb. Fresh Brussel sprouts, use 3 tablespoons of butter, 3 tablespoons of olive oil, teaspoon sea salt, fresh cracked pepper. Cut the sprouts in half by cutting off the bottoms. Cook at medium heat until tender. It will be a hit.\n\nSo this holiday I got a great recipe and a great family time. I wonder what Thanksgiving dinner was like with Debbie Wasserman Schultz?", "article_metadata": {"description": "I think my Thanksgiving experience was much more that of the average American.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2015/11/30/dom-giordano-column-partisan-thanksgiving-tips/", "image": {"width": 625, "secure_url": "https://cbsphilly.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/thanksgiving_meal.jpg?w=625", "identifier": "https://cbsphilly.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/thanksgiving_meal.jpg?w=625", "height": 352}, "type": "article", "description": "I think my Thanksgiving experience was much more that of the average American.", "title": "Dom Giordano Column - Partisan Thanksgiving Tips"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://cbsphilly.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/thanksgiving_meal.jpg?w=625", "description": "I think my Thanksgiving experience was much more that of the average American.", "site": "CBSphilly", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Dom Giordano Column - Partisan Thanksgiving Tips"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "News, Sports, Weather, Traffic and Philly's Top Spots", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CBS Philly", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/cbsphilly", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/cbsphilly"}, "keywords": "blogs, wpht, dom giordano, talk radio 1210 wpht, thanksgiving", "google-site-verification": "44caXBf4kjHeKKAT7ZZ89NaCX25utL_yRSa-qGpwIhY", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/40f9fbf792243f0932e0cab4dbd46d10?s=16", "news_keywords": "dom giordano, talk radio 1210 wpht, thanksgiving"}, "article_summary": "So this holiday I got a great recipe and a great family time.\nThis however defeats the vision of the American family that the Obama Administration and the Democratic National Committee share.\nPHILADELPHIA (CBS) \u2014 I hope your Thanksgiving dinner was a great time of family, food and fun.\nI wonder what Thanksgiving dinner was like with Debbie Wasserman Schultz?\nThat sounds like the normal American family enjoying one of our great holidays."}
