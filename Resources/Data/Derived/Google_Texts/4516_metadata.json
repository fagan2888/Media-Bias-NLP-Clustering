More people in older generations -- including 58 percent of the \"silent\" generation, which includes people ages 69 to 86 -- say there are big differences between the parties.\n\nPew surveyed 1,821 adults nationwide, including 617 millennials, from Feb. 14-23.\n\nPew found that 51 percent of millennials say they don't expect there to be any money in the Social Security system by the time they retire, while an additional 39 percent said the system will only be able to provide them with benefits at reduced levels. However, 61 percent oppose benefit cuts to Social Security.\n\nOn the issue of immigration, 55 percent of millennials said they favor a path to legalization for those who entered the country illegally -- making them the only age group in which a majority held that view.\n\nMillennials are as skeptical as older generations of the Affordable Care Act, Pew found.
