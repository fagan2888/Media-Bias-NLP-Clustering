A lesbian who was denied entry to a California strip club because she wasn’t with a man has now launched a lawsuit, claiming she was barred entry based on gender discrimination and sexual orientation.

Tamara Yatkin, 54, of El Segundo filed the suit in Los Angeles Superior Court against Paradise Showgirls for an incident she claimed took place a year ago, NBC’s local affiliate reported.

Miss Yatkin said she went the club on a friend’s recommendation, but was stopped at the door, the lawsuit claims.

The doorman asked if she was alone and when she said yes, he informed her that she had to be accompanied by a man to enter, according to the lawsuit.

The doorman, who is also the club’s manager, allegedly told her it was “policy” because of past instances of “women entering the club and causing problems.”

Miss Tatkin responded that she wasn’t a problem and was “a lesbian who wanted to spend money and have a good time,” but to no avail.

It took a year to file the suit because Miss Yatkin first filed discrimination complaints with the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing, NBC reported.
