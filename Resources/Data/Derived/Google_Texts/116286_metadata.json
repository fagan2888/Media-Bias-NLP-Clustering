(AP) - Here are the issues of significance in Virginia's 10th District U.S. House race between Democrat John Foust and Republican Barbara Comstock.\n\n1. HEALTH CARE\n\nComstock says she would vote to \"repeal and replace\" the national Affordable Care Act. Foust has said he would not repeal the legislation, which he calls \"a step toward what we need to accomplish in health care.\" He has said he supports improvements to the legislation.\n\n2. TAXES and BUDGET\n\nComstock has pledged not to raise taxes, and signed a pledge stating so with anti-tax activist Grover Norquist. Foust has touted his record on the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors in balancing budgets, which has relied at times on raising property tax rates.\n\n3. TRANSPORTATION\n\nComstock, as a Virginia state delegate, opposed a bipartisan transportation plan from Republican Gov. Bob McDonnell to increase transportation funding, which relied in part on raising taxes. Foust said he supported the legislation, which passed.\n\n4. ABORTION\n\nComstock is anti-abortion, but says the Foust campaign misrepresents her position in ads that say she would outlaw abortion even in cases of rape and incest. Comstock's campaign says she supports congressional legislation that has limited abortion funding for cases involving rape, incest, and when the mother's life is in danger.\n\nFoust, who is pro-abortion rights, says his campaign accurately characterizes Comstock's position. He says Comstock opposes the Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision and supports \"personhood\" legislation in Virginia that would confer the full rights of a person to an embryo from the moment of fertilization.\n\n5. MINIMUM WAGE\n\nComstock says increasing the minimum wage would result in the loss of 500,000 jobs nationally. Foust supports an increase.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Comstock-Foust congressional race heats up over key issues", "title": "Comstock-Foust congressional race heats up over key issues", "og": {"site_name": "WJLA", "description": "Comstock-Foust congressional race heats up over key issues", "title": "Comstock-Foust congressional race heats up over key issues", "url": "http://wjla.com/news/local/comstock-foust-congressional-race-heats-up-over-key-issues-108265", "image": "http://static-12.sinclairstoryline.com/resources/media/57bd0296-a73f-47d2-8abd-1a02466c9ab0-comstock_foust_collage_ap_wjla_606.jpg?1436570006773", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://static-11.sinclairstoryline.com/resources/media/57bd0296-a73f-47d2-8abd-1a02466c9ab0-comstock_foust_collage_ap_wjla_606.jpg?1436570006773", "description": "Comstock-Foust congressional race heats up over key issues", "site": "@abc7news", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Comstock-Foust congressional race heats up over key issues"}, "author": "Sinclair Broadcast Group", "blitz": "mu-cc36119f-f4dca522-3261b206-4b3bbd3f", "robots": "index, follow", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 889260367778456}, "google-site-verification": "vlvPG0QCf_iiMAIUjDk9GCC6YfRPCgJDgceUS8eJjt8", "keywords": "news,elections,local,VA", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/wjlatv", "published_time": "2014-10-20T18:37:24+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=0.5"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1cca\"", "article_summary": "LEESBURG, Va.
