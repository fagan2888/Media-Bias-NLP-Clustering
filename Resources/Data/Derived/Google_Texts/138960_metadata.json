At the end of 2009, more than 1.1 million people in the U.S. ages 13 and older were living with HIV. Some 80,000 of these people have been living with the disease for decades, and they are known as long-term survivors. Thursday, June 5, is National HIV/AIDS Long-Term Survivors Awareness Day.\n\nYoung people may not remember the deadly virus that ravaged communities around the world in the 1980s. Today, HIV is a manageable disease. In fact, a 20-year-old white gay man in the U.S. diagnosed with HIV today can expect to live as long as any other American man.\n\nGet the Facts: Life Expectancy for North Americans with HIV Reaches Historic High \u00bb\n\nBy next year, experts expect that half of all Americans living with HIV will be 50 or older. By 2020, that number will rise to 70 percent. Indeed, the median age for someone with HIV in the U.S. today is 58.\n\nA report released this week by three HIV and elder care advocacy groups has called on the U.S. government to prepare for and adapt to this new population of seniors living with HIV/AIDS. They want this topic addressed next year at the White House Conference on Aging, and they offer eight recommendations for improving the health and well-being of older adults with HIV.\n\nRead Related News: U.S. Centers for Disease Control Say Yes to Truvada for HIV Prevention \u00bb\n\n1. Put HIV on the Agenda\n\nTopping the list compiled by the Diverse Elders Coalition (DEC), the AIDS Community Research Initiative of America (ACRIA), and Services and Advocacy for GLBT Elders (SAGE) is a request that the White House put the issue of HIV and aging on the agenda for its once-in-a-decade aging conference, scheduled for 2015. The discussion needs to center on how to reach this population and identify their needs.\n\nRobert Espinoza, senior director of public policy and communications for SAGE, told Healthline that older people at risk for HIV often have a different set of circumstances than other at-risk or infected groups.\n\n\u201cSome older people become sexually active later in life after a partner or spouse passes away,\u201d he said. So they are less likely to have tools and coping skills for safer sex.\n\n2. Identify Those with Special Needs\n\nThe report also says that seniors with HIV need to be designated a population of \u201cGreatest Social Need\u201d if and when the U.S. Congress reauthorizes the Older Americans Act of 1965.\n\nMany older gay men, in particular, grew up in a bygone era of extreme discrimination and stigma. As a result, they may not disclose their sexuality to their doctors, so the doctors won't know they are at risk.\n\nIn the end, these men are often diagnosed with HIV and AIDS concurrently because they don\u2019t get tested until symptoms appear, Espinoza said. This can be further complicated by the fact that some symptoms of HIV resemble symptoms of aging and so go unchecked.\n\nLearn More: HIV Symptoms in Men \u00bb\n\n3. Test, Test, Test\n\nAdvocacy groups urge Congress to allocate more funds to the CDC so that the agency can devise campaigns aimed at the elderly that encourage them to get tested for HIV.\n\nThere is a myth that older people don\u2019t have sex, Espinoza said, but they do. Even though the CDC recommends annual HIV testing through the age of 65, many doctors don\u2019t adhere to this guideline.\n\nGetting older people tested and into treatment would not only save the healthcare system money in the long run, Espinoza said, but also help avoid a public health crisis.\n\n4. Track HIV Data\n\nThe CDC and other government agencies should focus on tracking HIV (called disease surveillance) among people ages 50 and older.\n\nA Real-Life 'Dallas Buyer' Remembers an Era\u2014and Says He's Amazed to Be Alive \u00bb\n\n5. Expand Medicaid Coverage\n\nThe report also suggests expanding Medicaid coverage as outlined in the Affordable Care Act (ACA) so that people younger than 65, who don\u2019t yet qualify for Medicare, can get treatment regardless of their ability to pay.\n\n6. Increase Funding for the Ryan White Program\n\nAdvocates are pushing for more money for the federal Ryan White program, which \u201chas been essentially flat-funded for the last decade despite the ongoing severity of the epidemic, especially among older people,\u201d according to the report.\n\nThis is particularly important, the report argues, in states where Medicaid has not been expanded. Those states include Louisiana, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, and Texas, where HIV infection rates are on the rise.\n\n7. Fund NIH Research on HIV\n\nThe report calls for increasing support to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), to fund more research on HIV and aging among diverse populations.\n\n\u201cOn average, adults age 60 and older have more than two chronic diseases,\u201d the report states. One ACRIA study found that the most common conditions among people 50 and older with HIV include depression, arthritis, hepatitis, neuropathy, and high blood pressure.\n\nLongevity Secrets: Advice from Golden Olympians \u00bb\n\n8. Create Better Clinical Guidelines\n\nLastly, the advocacy groups say the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services must develop treatment guidelines specifically for the care of older people with HIV.\n\nMore resources on HIV and aging can be found online at the National Resource Center on LGBT Aging.", "article_metadata": {"standout": "http://www.healthline.com/health-news/preparing-for-seniors-with-hiv-060414", "news_keywords": "HIV, seniors, National HIV/AIDS Long-Term Survivors Awareness Day, LGBT seniors, long-term HIV/AIDS, AIDS, Medicaid, ACA", "og": {"site_name": "Healthline", "description": "On the eve of National HIV/AIDS Long-Term Survivors Awareness Day, a new report shows that the median age of Americans with HIV is 58 and that the the United States is woefully unprepared for a growing population of seniors with the virus.", "title": "8 Ways the U.S. Must Prepare for More Seniors with HIV", "url": "http://www.healthline.com/health-news/preparing-for-seniors-with-hiv-060414", "image": "http://www.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/activeseniorman.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/activeseniorman.jpg", "description": "On the eve of National HIV/AIDS Long-Term Survivors Awareness Day, a new report shows that the median age of Americans with HIV is 58 and that the the United States is woefully unprepared for a growing population of seniors with the virus.", "card": "summary", "title": "8 Ways the U.S. Must Prepare for More Seniors with HIV"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP", "DC.date.issued": "2014-06-04", "fb": {"app_id": 239371929577489}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "On the eve of National HIV/AIDS Long-Term Survivors Awareness Day, a new report shows that the median age of Americans with HIV is 58 and that the the United States is woefully unprepared for a growing population of seniors with the virus."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd789\"", "article_summary": "Track HIV DataThe CDC and other government agencies should focus on tracking HIV (called disease surveillance) among people ages 50 and older.\nThis can be further complicated by the fact that some symptoms of HIV resemble symptoms of aging and so go unchecked.\nLearn More: HIV Symptoms in Men \u00bb3.\nAt the end of 2009, more than 1.1 million people in the U.S. ages 13 and older were living with HIV.\nMore resources on HIV and aging can be found online at the National Resource Center on LGBT Aging."}
