Mr. Woods infamously authored Issue 3, which narrowly passed in 2014 and is now Amendment 94 to the state constitution.\n\nIt passed, even though every single poll during the election and afterwards shows that voters opposed Woods\u2019s amendment . . . that is, when they understood what was actually in the longest constitutional amendment in the state\u2019s history. Amendment 94 now comprises roughly an eighth of the entire document, including nearly a hundred other amendments.\n\nBut voters didn\u2019t know the contents.\n\nBecause Woods didn\u2019t tell them.\n\nInstead, he cheated voters by wording the ballot title to claim Issue 3 was \u201cPROHIBITING MEMBERS OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY . . . FROM ACCEPTING GIFTS FROM LOBBYISTS.\u201d But now with the amendment in effect, lobbyists buy legislators breakfast, lunch and dinner pretty much every day they\u2019re in session.\n\nHe misleadingly told voters the amendment was \u201cESTABLISHING TERM LIMITS FOR MEMBERS OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY,\u201d when in reality the term limits already in effect were weakened under his measure, allowing pols like Woods to stay a whopping 16 years in a single seat.\n\nThe slippery solon\u2019s amendment also created a so-called Independent Citizens Commission \u2014 a majority appointed by legislative leaders \u2014 to set salaries for elected officials, including state legislators. Like Woods, for instance. Said commission received overwhelming public comment against increasing pay for state legislators and yet, in an unmistakable sign of glorious independence, rewarded legislators with a whopping 150 percent pay raise.\n\nThe Arkansas Times \u2019s Max Brantley called it \u201cstrange\u201d that the \u201cfull-time legislator . . . would drop out of the race at this point.\u201d Now that it\u2019s time to face the voters with all his mighty \u201caccomplishments,\u201d the senator decided \u201cto start a new chapter in [his] life.\u201d\n\nDejected, befuddled, limping home as a martyr to crony politics, Woods knows he can\u2019t win \u2014 meaning the Arkansas insider\u2019s reign of trickery is thankfully ending.\n\nIt\u2019s ironic. Woods defrauded Arkansas voters with his deceptively worded 2014 ballot measure. The successful scam weakening term limits allows him to stay in the Senate for 16 years, instead of just eight. But now, angry voters won\u2019t allow Woods another term.\n\nAt least, that sure appears to be the case.\n\nNow, it is true that if voters in next year\u2019s March primary could possibly be as uninformed about Woods\u2019s record as they were about last November\u2019s Issue 3, he would walk back into office in triumph. But Woods has made enemies: term limits supporters and Conduit for Action, a group sharply critical of him for supporting Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion and for gutting the Arkansas Ethics Commission, to identify just two. He not unreasonably fears they would communicate with his constituents.\n\nIn effect, \u201ctell on him.\u201d\n\nFool the voters once, shame on Woods. Fool the voters twice . . . well . . . \u2019tain\u2019t going to happen. That\u2019s not to say the sly schemer didn\u2019t have another unethical, underhanded, anti-democratic trick up his sleeve.\n\nOf course he did.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had serious conversations with my family about leaving . . . since April,\u201d Woods told reporters. Yet, the incumbent didn\u2019t bother to announce publicly that he was vacating the seat until the weekend before a Monday filing deadline.\n\n\u201cMy intention was to announce this decision earlier,\u201d Woods acknowledged, \u201cbut constituent obligations, being under the weather, and tremendous pressure to remain in the race delayed my action.\u201d Yeah, right. No doubt the sun was in his eyes as well.\n\nHis delay? A tactic \u2014 not new. By postponing his announcement he helped circumvent a meaningful election. He provided a leg up to a crony. Waiting until the last possible moment to announce one\u2019s retirement is an age-old method whereby insider politicians game the system.\n\nLuckily, Justice of the Peace Sharon Lloyd had already stepped up to challenge Woods \u2014 and his insider political games.\n\nIt\u2019s nice to know that Woods is on his way out. It\u2019s too bad, though, that he doesn\u2019t just resign and spare the people another year of suffering.\n\nWait: maybe the wicked Mr. Woods won\u2019t last that full year.\n\n\u201cRumors have been flying for months about federal investigations of Arkansas politicians and lobbyists,\u201d notes a commentary on the Conduit for Action website. Both the FBI and IRS are now investigating the misuse of what\u2019s known as General Improvement Funds \u2014 a slush fund that allows incumbent state legislators to steer millions in taxpayer money to their favorite cronies in similar corrupting fashion to the U.S. Congress\u2019s earmarks.\n\nSen. Woods is a walking advertisement for term limits. It would certainly be poetic justice if the next term he serves is behind bars.", "article_metadata": {"description": "I want to go home, Arkansas State Senator Jon Woods whimpered last weekend..05/27/2016 7:32:40AM EST.", "author": "Paul Jacob", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "I want to go home, Arkansas State Senator Jon Woods whimpered last weekend.", "title": "A Sudden Case of Homesickness", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/pauljacob/2015/11/15/a-sudden-case-of-homesickness-n2080925", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/160/2015-06-09T202723Z_1_LYNXMPEB580ZD_RTROPTP_3_USA-OBAMA.JPG", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "I want to go home, Arkansas State Senator Jon Woods whimpered last weekend.", "title": "A Sudden Case of Homesickness", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/pauljacob/2015/11/15/a-sudden-case-of-homesickness-n2080925", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/160/2015-06-09T202723Z_1_LYNXMPEB580ZD_RTROPTP_3_USA-OBAMA.JPG", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "A Sudden Case of Homesickness, Paul Jacob, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "The successful scam weakening term limits allows him to stay in the Senate for 16 years, instead of just eight.\nCertainly, that Senator Woods has any friends left is news \u2014 at least, non-lobbyist, non-legislator friends.\n\u201cI want to go home,\u201d Arkansas State Senator Jon Woods whimpered last weekend.\nBut voters didn\u2019t know the contents.\nBecause Woods didn\u2019t tell them."}
