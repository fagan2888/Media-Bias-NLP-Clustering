The truth is, none of those four companies are obligated because you didn\u2019t stay longer than 90 days. That\u2019s the trouble that some of the behind-the-scenes workers in Hollywood face as they try to navigate President Obama\u2019s health-care overhaul, says Mark Goldstein, chief executive of Entertainment Partners.\n\nThe Burbank-based company contracts out to studios and film producers for payroll and production management services. But finding an answer to the Obamacare question isn\u2019t an easy one. And employers aren\u2019t off the hook. They still employ full-time staffs throughout the year; it\u2019s just that it can be a constantly revolving crew.\n\n\u201cThe industry has reached out to see if we could facilitate something,\u201d Goldstein said. With up to 100,000 non-union workers spread out to do as many as 3,000 projects a year, it\u2019s tough to find a cost-effective way to insure those workers.\n\nIn an effort to cut through the confusion, Entertainment Partners has set up its own private insurance exchange so that the risk could be spread throughout the entire industry. That way the makeup artist that drifts from job to job can be on equal footing with, say, a camera operator that has been working on \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live\u201d in the heart of Hollywood for the last five years.\n\nTrouble is, much of the rest of the film industry that doesn\u2019t contract out with Entertainment Partners\u2019 \u201cEP Cares\u201d program can\u2019t participate in the exchange. Until then, however, others in the film industry and its workers may be scrambling to find insurance. Because of the uneven nature of entertainment work, large chunks of workers could be left to get coverage on their own.\n\n\u201cAn entire full-time employee base could be subject to penalties,\u201d he said.\n\nFollow Russ Britt on Twitter @russbrittmktw\n\nFollow Health Exchange on Twitter @MWHealthBlog\n\nMore health-care news from MarketWatch:\n\nMedtronic implants tiny pacemaker without surgery\n\nObamacare signups accelerate in California\n\nNew Obamacare wrinkle: Deadline is pushed back on early payments", "article_metadata": {"article.created": "2013-12-16T10:13:56-05:00", "application-name": "MarketWatch.com", "twitter": {"domain": "Marketwatch.com", "description": "If thinking about Obamacare gives you headaches, be glad you're not a member of a film crew in the Los Angeles area.", "title": "Obamacare causing headaches?
