(Photo: Russ DeSantis)\n\nSome 17,000 drivers today are cruising between Middletown and Red Bank, basking in the glow of a happy Christmas and Hanukkah or excitedly preparing their New Year\u2019s Eve plans.\n\nExpect delays in Middletown as West Front Bridge project nears\n\nBut starting Jan. 5, those same motorists will face a veritable vehicular aggravation \u2014 a traffic hangover, if you will \u2014 as the bridge that carries West Front Street over the Swimming River closes until May.\n\nThe backup is expected to be so bad that Monmouth County officials intentionally designed the project to minimize the bridge closure. And now that it\u2019s here, those same officials are more-than-gently nudging drivers to try to avoid that route if at all possible.\n\nBut once the work is done, pegged for May 17, the new bridge will bring a much improved route for motorists as well as a safe pathway for pedestrians and bicyclists.\n\n\u201cIt will be an inconvenience and we would be naive to say it\u2019s not going to be an inconvenience,\u201d said Freeholder Tom Arnone, who is the liaison to the county\u2019s Department of Public Works and Engineering.\n\n\u201cBut everyone who drives over that bridge, who listens to the crickety-cracks knows that this was inevitable, the replacement of this bridge. There is a time that inconvenience does get outweighed by safety.\u201d\n\nTraffic has largely remained open on the bridge, known locally as Hubbard\u2019s Bridge, since the federally-funded, $21.9 million replacement project began in August 2013.\n\nThe new bridge is being built to the north of Hubbard\u2019s Bridge, which now needs to close so the new span can be connected to the road.\n\nThe plan is to move traffic onto the new bridge ahead of the tourism season that kicks off Memorial Day weekend.\n\nThe contractor, Agate Construction of Ocean View, will then remove the old bridge, which was first constructed in 1921.\n\nThere will be a detour in place: From Red Bank, motorists would take West Front Street to Rector Place to Route 35 across Coopers Bridge, then onto Navesink River Road to Hubbard Avenue.\n\nTraffic from West Front Street in Middletown would use the same detour in reverse.\n\nBut motorists should drive a different way if they have one, Monmouth County spokeswoman Laura Kirkpatrick said.\n\n\u201cIf people have another way to get to the (Garden State) Parkway or get to western Monmouth, we are suggesting they plan an alternative route. It may be more challenging for people who need to get into Red Bank for work or for school,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt is going to be a very good improvement for the area. Unfortunately, this is the pain we have to live through to get to that.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.app.com/1B6VvEp", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Red Bank, Middletown motorists will face traffic headaches ahead of a big safety upgrades.", "og": {"site_name": "Asbury Park Press", "description": "Red Bank, Middletown motorists will face traffic headaches ahead of a big safety upgrades.", "title": "W.
