Now they reply, \u201cIt\u2019s legal in Colorado.\u201d\n\nThese can be confusing times for middle- and high-school students, who for most of their young lives have been lectured about the perils of marijuana. Now it seems that some of the adults in their lives have done an about-face.\n\nRecreational marijuana is legal in Colorado and Washington state, and many other states have approved it for medical use. Lawmakers, the media and even parents are debating the merits of full-scale legalization.\n\n\u201cThey are growing up in a generation where marijuana used to be bad, and maybe now it\u2019s not bad,\u201d said Ryan, a senior prevention specialist with FCD Educational Services, an anti-drug group that works with students in the classroom. \u201cTheir parents are telling them not to do it, but they may be supporting legalization of it at the same time.\u201d\n\nAnti-drug advocates say their goal is not to vilify marijuana or take a stand on legalization; instead, they say their role is to convince young people and their parents that the use of drugs is not just a moral or legal issue, but a significant health issue.\n\n\u201cThe health risks are real,\u201d said Steve Pasierb, chief executive of the Partnership for Drug-Free Kids. \u201cEvery passing year, science unearths more health risks about why any form of substance use is unhealthy for young people.\u201d\n\nNearly half of teenagers \u2014 44 percent \u2014 have tried marijuana at least once, according to data from the partnership. Regular use is less common.\n\nIn the states where marijuana is legal, it remains, like alcohol, off-limits to anyone younger than 21.\n\n\u201cMaking it legal makes it much more accessible, more available,\u201d said Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse. \u201cThis is the reality, so what we need to do is to prevent the damage or at least minimize it as much as possible.\u201d\n\nDrug prevention experts say the \u201cJust Say No\u201d approach of the 1980s does not work. The goal of parents should not be to prevent their kids from ever trying marijuana. Instead, the focus should be on practical reasons to delay use of any mind-altering substance, including alcohol, until they are older.\n\nThe reason is that young brains continue to develop until the early 20s, and young people who start using alcohol or marijuana in their teens are far more vulnerable to long-term substance-abuse problems.\n\nThe brain is still wiring itself during adolescence, and any drug use during this period essentially trains the reward system to embrace a mind-altering chemical.\n\n\u201cWe know that 90 percent of adults who are addicted began use in teenage years,\u201d Pasierb said. \u201cThey programmed the reward and drive center of their teenage brain that this is one of those things that rewards and drives me like food does, like sex does.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have to focus on brain maturation,\u201d he said. \u201cThis generation of kids wants good brains; they want to get into better schools. Talk to a junior or senior about whether marijuana use shaves a couple points off their SATs, and they will listen to you.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2012/06/ARIZ_MEDICAL_MARIJUANA_1.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8368\"", "article_summary": "Recreational marijuana is legal in Colorado and Washington state, and many other states have approved it for medical use.\nThe reason is that young brains continue to develop until the early 20s, and young people who start using alcohol or marijuana in their teens are far more vulnerable to long-term substance-abuse problems.\nIn the states where marijuana is legal, it remains, like alcohol, off-limits to anyone younger than 21.\nWhen anti-drug educator Tim Ryan talks to students, he often asks them what they know about marijuana.\nNow they reply, \u201cIt\u2019s legal in Colorado.\u201dThese can be confusing times for middle- and high-school students, who for most of their young lives have been lectured about the perils of marijuana."}
