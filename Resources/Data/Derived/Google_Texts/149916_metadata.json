So her April 3 article in the Weekly Standard, \u201cObamacare Pinches the Poor,\u201d on ACA\u2019s tax requirements will understandably concern many low-income citizens.** She writes:\n\nAccording to the www.healthcare.gov web site, you can get an income-based exemption if \u201cyou don\u2019t have to file a tax return because your income is below the level that requires you to file.\u201d Sounds simple enough, right? Until further investigation reveals that this exemption is claimed directly on the tax return. That\u2019s right \u2013 the tax return you\u2019re not required to file. While the circular nature of this exemption is ludicrous on its face, its effects are far-reaching and incredibly regressive\u2026. It\u2019s a safe bet that many members of this population will not be cognizant of their need to file simply to avoid the Obamacare penalty for being uninsured. [\u2026.]compliance with this behemoth law disproportionately burdens the poorest of the poor. Like a shark silently stalking its unknowing prey, Obamacare lurks waiting to take a bite out of the unwary. And in this case, it\u2019s the poor.\n\nYet another stupid Rube Goldberg application of the Nanny State, right? Well no. actually. ACA has its share of glitches and complications. But this isn\u2019t one of them. As ACA legal expert Timothy Jost notes over email, Pinter is wrong.\n\nIndeed here is the government\u2019s actual directions to low-income people. I found this through a quick Google search at a website called IRS.gov:\n\nIf you are not required to file a tax return and don\u2019t want to file a return, you do not need to file a return solely to report your coverage or to claim an exemption.\n\nThis isn\u2019t Nanny State. It isn\u2019t Rube Goldberg. Nothing behemoth. No shark is stalking or biting. It\u2019s not particularly complicated, either.\n\nThe Weekly Standard should run a correction on this important point.\n\n*A friend notes that my description of Ms. Pinter as a tax attorney conveys the impression that Ms. Pinter is someone whose main duties are assisting people with their taxes. Her byline says: \u201cKimberly Pinter is a tax policy lawyer and writer in Northern Virginia.\u201d Her Twitter byline notes that she is a \u201cTax policy expert, lawyer, lobbyist, jewelry designer, and Zumba fitness instructor.\u201d Sounds kindof cool, actually.\n\n**Update: I received a very professional email from the Weekly Standard. To their credit, they are now looking into this. I await a correction or amplification.", "article_metadata": {"robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd6bdb\"", "article_summary": "So her April 3 article in the Weekly Standard, \u201cObamacare Pinches the Poor,\u201d on ACA\u2019s tax requirements will understandably concern many low-income citizens.\nUntil further investigation reveals that this exemption is claimed directly on the tax return.\nThat\u2019s right \u2013 the tax return you\u2019re not required to file.\n**Update: I received a very professional email from the Weekly Standard.\nThe Weekly Standard should run a correction on this important point."}
