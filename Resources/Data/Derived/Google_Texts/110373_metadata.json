i.e., medical care, public health interventions, individual behavior and genetic information, as well as social (e.g., education, employment, cultural background) and physical (e.g., air and water quality, environmental safety) elements.\n\nIt follows that population health management is the application of processes, proactive strategies, and interventions to defined groups of individuals across the continuum of care with a focus on making the healthcare delivery system safer, more clinically precise, and more cost-effective.\n\nBecause population health figures prominently in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), it has become a priority on the national health reform agenda and we are beginning to see its ripple effect in the agendas of other fields -- most notably, healthcare quality improvement.\n\nUnder the ACA, reimbursement and revenue are more closely tied to quality improvement and patient outcomes for populations as well as individuals, and we've witnessed rapid growth in shared accountability financial arrangements -- from accountable care organizations to the Medicare Shared Savings Program to provider performance on Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) measures.\n\nWith significant financial incentives and penalties at stake, there has been a noticeable upswing in population health management activity; this, in turn, is driving advances in complex population health information technology applications that not only measure and report quality, but also provide the means by which quality improvement efforts can be enhanced.\n\nThe road to achieving real quality improvement and fully implementing the Triple Aim of improved patient experience, improved population health, and reduced per-capita cost of care is not an easy one -- it will take a monumental effort just to move beyond retrospective reporting -- but as progress is made (e.g., the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's work to decrease central-line-associated infections), the health of the population will surely improve.\n\nWhile there is a natural affinity between the public health sector and population health, there is a symbiotic relationship between population management and quality improvement; population health has a relentless focus on process improvement and measurement and in healthcare quality circles the operative statement is, \"if you can't measure it, you can't improve it.\"\n\nAs we push the population health agenda, we mustn't forget about the blocking and tackling of quality improvement (for example, \"never events\" such as wrong site surgery continue to occur at unacceptable rates); to achieve a healthy population we must always keep an eye on the performance improvement ball.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "David   Nash, MD, MBA, FACP", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.medpagetoday.com/Columns/FocusonPolicy/56260", "image": "http://clf1.medpagetoday.com/assets/images/defaultLede.png", "description": "This young but expanding field deserves attention, says David Nash, MD, MBA", "card": "Summary", "title": "Population Health's Ripple Effect"}, "dc.date.issued": "2016-02-18 14:00:00", "sailthru.is_cme": 0, "sailthru.tags": "primarycare,publichealthpolicy,healthpolicy,generalprimarycare,columns,hospitalbasedmedicine,focusonpolicy,nursing,nursing", "sailthru.date": "2016-02-18 14:00:00", "sailthru.title": "Population Health's Ripple Effect", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "verify-v1": "Vy2WQqSVx1yA90Uu2Rw12f2R8yqP7X0cxBFbafIuqao=", "sailthru.exclude": 1, "description": "This young but expanding field deserves attention, says David Nash, MD, MBA", "sailthru.expire_date": "2016-02-19 14:02:00", "date": "2016-02-18 14:00:00", "sailthru.description": "This young but expanding field deserves attention, says David Nash, MD, MBA", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og": {"url": "http://www.medpagetoday.com/Columns/FocusonPolicy/56260", "image": "http://clf1.medpagetoday.com/assets/images/defaultLede.png", "type": "article", "description": "This young but expanding field deserves attention, says David Nash, MD, MBA", "title": "Population Health's Ripple Effect"}, "sailthru.featured": 0, "dc.date": "2016-02-18 14:00:00", "sailthru.is_video": 0, "google-site-verification": "0uwxbLV_H5lccP3wm0UgRXFQ9w6ZQXh9ZLn-G0av8i0", "sailthru.speciality": "Other,primarycare,hospitalmedicine", "sailthru.image.full": "http://clf1.medpagetoday.com/assets/images/defaultLede.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcb6a\"", "article_summary": "As we gear up for the 16th annual Population Health Colloquium here in Philadelphia (March 7-9), it seems an ideal time to reflect on this relatively young, sometimes misunderstood, but vitally important field.\nWhile there is a natural affinity between the public health sector and population health, there is a symbiotic relationship between population management and quality improvement;
