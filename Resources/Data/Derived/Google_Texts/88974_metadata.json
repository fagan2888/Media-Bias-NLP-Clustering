People who text and drive spend at least five minutes looking down at their phone while they should be looking at the road, which means they drive the length of a football field at 55 mph with their eyes pretty much closed. In hopes of dissuading people who think texting and driving isn\u2019t that big of a deal, AT&T\u2019s \u201cIt Can Wait\u201d campaign is asking all drivers to take the pledge not to text and drive by pausing the conversation with #X.\n\nJoin over five million people, including celebrities such as Demi Lovato and Tim McGraw, by taking the pledge to tell your friends you\u2019re getting ready to drive via #X. No text is worth jeopardizing your life or the lives of your fellow drivers, and by typing #X you won\u2019t have to worry about your friends thinking that they\u2019re being ignored.\n\nAn estimated 82 percent of young Americans between ages 16 and 17 own cells phones. On average, 34 percent admit to texting and driving. What\u2019s worse is that 77 percent of young Americans say they are very or somewhat confident in their texting and driving abilities, while 55 percent say it\u2019s easy to text and drive. Teens and young adults aren\u2019t the only ones prone to texting and driving. Fifteen percent of young Americans say they have seen at least one of their parents text while driving and 48 percent of kids between the ages of 12 and 17 say they have been in a car with a driver who was texting.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "texting, driving, #x, it, can, wait", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "AT&T's \"It Can Wait\" campaign gives drivers a simple solution that will help us all avoid texting and driving: #X.", "title": "Find Out How #X Could Help Save Millions Of Lives [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/texting-and-driving-how-hashtag-x-could-help-keep-millions-safe-304444", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/23/x.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "AT&T's \"It Can Wait\" campaign gives drivers a simple solution that will help us all avoid texting and driving: #X.", "title": "Find Out How #X Could Help Save Millions Of Lives [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/texting-and-driving-how-hashtag-x-could-help-keep-millions-safe-304444", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/23/x.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/23/x.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-09-23T10:38:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-23T10:38:00-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "AT&T's \"It Can Wait\" campaign gives drivers a simple solution that will help us all avoid texting and driving: #X."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca0db\"", "article_summary": "An estimated 82 percent of young Americans between ages 16 and 17 own cells phones.\nAround 23 percent (1.3 million) of all automobile collisions in the United States involved a cell phone in 2011.\nJoin over five million people, including celebrities such as Demi Lovato and Tim McGraw, by taking the pledge to tell your friends you\u2019re getting ready to drive via #X.\nWhat\u2019s worse is that 77 percent of young Americans say they are very or somewhat confident in their texting and driving abilities, while 55 percent say it\u2019s easy to text and drive.\nTeens and young adults aren\u2019t the only ones prone to texting and driving."}
