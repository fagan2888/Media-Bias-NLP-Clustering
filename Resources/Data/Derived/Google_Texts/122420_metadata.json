Researchers found that Magnet hospitals correlate with higher reports of excellent quality care.\n\n\"Having visible and accessible chief nurses, encouraging and including nurses in decision-making in their unit and throughout the organization, supporting nursing practice and engaging in interdisciplinary patient care, are but a few examples of readily modifiable features of a hospital,\" she said. \"Because all organizations, Magnet and otherwise, have the potential to enrich their practice environment, every organization stands to benefit from improving the organization of nursing care.\"\n\nThe American Nurses Credentialing Center offers magnet recognition to hospitals that provide quality patient care, nursing excellence and innovations in professional nursing practice. Nine percent of U.S. hospitals have Magnet status.\n\nThe study underscores results of previous research published in Medical Care, which found Magnet hospitals that invest in nurse staffing, education and work environments achieve better patient outcomes and lower mortality rates.\n\nSurgical mortality was 20 percent lower at magnet hospitals, after adjustments for clinical factors, according to research by the University of Pennsylvania School of Nursing, FierceHealthcare previously reported. Surgical patients in Magnet hospitals also were 14 percent less likely to die in the hospital within 30 days. In addition, mortality among patients experiencing complications was 12 percent lower than non-Magnet hospitals.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the study abstract\n\n- read the announcement\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nStudy credits nurse work environment for better outcomes\n\nSurvey: Nurse understaffing, fatigue threatens patient safety\n\nNurses say profession changing for worse\n\nFewer patient deaths linked to more four-year nursing degrees", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hospitals that have visible and accessible chief nurses and also involve nurses in care-delivery decisions offer better quality of care, according to a new\u00a0study\u00a0published in\u00a0The Journal of Nursing Administration.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Hospitals that have visible and accessible chief nurses and also involve nurses in care-delivery decisions offer better quality of care, according to a new\u00a0study\u00a0published in\u00a0The Journal of Nursing Administration.", "title": "Give nurses the power to make care decisions to improve patient outcomes", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/give-nurses-power-make-care-decisions-improve-patient-outcomes/2014-03-12", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "American Nurses Credentialing Center,Care Delivery,HR & Workforce Management,Journal of Nursing Administration,magnet hospitals,Marketing,Patient Care & Outcomes,Quality Improvement", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,HR & Workforce Management,Marketing,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfea7\"", "article_summary": "The American Nurses Credentialing Center offers magnet recognition to hospitals that provide quality patient care, nursing excellence and innovations in professional nursing practice.\nResearchers found that Magnet hospitals correlate with higher reports of excellent quality care.\nHospitals that have visible and accessible chief nurses and also involve nurses in care-delivery decisions offer better quality of care, according to a new study published in The Journal of Nursing Administration.\nThe study underscores results of previous research published in Medical Care, which found Magnet hospitals that invest in nurse staffing, education and work environments achieve better patient outcomes and lower mortality rates.\nSurgical patients in Magnet hospitals also were 14 percent less likely to die in the hospital within 30 days."}
