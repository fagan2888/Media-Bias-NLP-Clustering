(AP) - It\u2019s 7 a.m. on a cool summer morning in Riverside down by the shore of Long Island Sound. Tim Lovett, 35, joined by Trevor Stanco, 26, of Norwalk, is stripping down to his swim trunks.\n\nIt\u2019s high tide and the water is cold, but thoughts of remaining on shore and dry, if there are any, are quickly swept away. They have a big swim coming up and have to train.\n\nLovett and Stanco are part of two relay teams chosen by Swim Across America for the nonprofit\u2019s first English Channel crossing in aid of those with cancer.\n\nThe crossing to France is scheduled for Aug. 31.\n\n\u201cWe have a one-week window in which to attempt the swim,\u201d says Lovett, \u201cto work around tides and inclement weather.\u201d\n\nThe distance of the Channel crossing is about 24 miles. \u201cBut we will swim more due to current and tides,\u201d Lovett says.\n\nThe last time Lovett checked, the temperature of the water in the English Channel was 61 degrees. He reckons it\u2019ll have warmed up by late August, but has been working to acclimate his body to the Channel\u2019s coolness, nonetheless. Lovett began swimming in the cold waters of a lake in New Jersey in May, and then moved to Long Island Sound when the water hit the high 50s and 60s.\n\n\u201cIt was pretty tough,\u201d he says, adding that he\u2019s eating more against the cold.\n\nNo wet suits are to be worn swimming, decrees the Channel Swimming Association. \u201cThey oversee everyone\u2019s attempt at swimming,\u201d says Lovett.\n\nSwim Across America is an organization dedicated to raising money and support for cancer research, prevention and treatment through swimming-related events.\n\nLovett, a former captain of the Greenwich High School swim team, has taken part in SAA events for 13 years. It was in a post-college job working at Tudor Investment Group that Lovett was introduced to Swim Across America by Tudor COO John MacFarlane, an avid tri-athlete.\n\nOver the years Lovett\u2019s involvement with the organization became more personal when cancer came to his family. His mother, Helen, died of cancer in 2006 and his father, Nigel, is currently recovering from thyroid cancer.\n\nTo qualify as Channel-crossing team Lovett and the other members had to swim for two hours in cold water __ and raise $10,000. As of Sunday, Lovett had raised $6,885, or 68 percent of his goal.\n\n\u201cThe funds will pay for part of the swim,\u201d he says, \u201cbut travel and accommodation are our own responsibility.\u201d\n\nLovett and Stanco\u2019s team of five has an appropriate title, \u201cBuoys and a Girl.\u201d The team includes one female, Stanco\u2019s sister Alexa. The other team, of six, comes from California, Oklahoma and London. Ages of swimmers range from late 20\u2019s to mid 50\u2019s.\n\nThe crossing to France will kick off from the shores of the white cliffs of Dover a minute past midnight. Relay team members will take to the water in hour-long shifts. Lovett figures it\u2019ll be a 12- to 15-hour day of swimming.\n\n\u201cThe interesting thing about an open water swim,\u201d says Lovett, \u201cis it\u2019s variable conditions.\u201d\n\nVariable, as in boat traffic, jellyfish, swimming through two different tides, waves and rain.\n\nTraveling with the teams will be a 30-foot fishing boat. The pilot will help the swimmers to navigate the currents and the shipping lanes.\n\n\u201cTo minimize any added distance,\u201d says Lovett.\n\nIn the best British style, the pilot will also provide a cup of hot tea to help warm the swimmers.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Greenwich Time, http://www.greenwichtime.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "It's 7 a.m. on a cool summer morning in Riverside down by the shore of Long Island Sound.
