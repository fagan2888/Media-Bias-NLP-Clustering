The Commissioner, after review, submitted her approved rates to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) in August. CMS has final authority on the rates. CMS concurred with the Commissioner\u2019s recommendations and announced their approval on September 21, 2015.\n\nIt is the Commissioner\u2019s duty to evaluate the reasonableness of rates to ensure rates are not excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory.\n\nThe Commissioner recommended approval of a 22.4% rate increase in the individual market for Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield of Delaware, a reduction of 3.0% from Highmark\u2019s June request of 25.4%. Highmark had made a second request in late August for an additional 8% increase, for an overall rate hike of more than 33% which the Commissioner rejected out of hand.\n\nAetna Life Insurance Company\u2019s request for a 16% increase in the individual market was also approved. In the small group market, Highmark\u2019s request for a 12.7% increase was granted, as was Aetna\u2019s request for a 6.1% decrease.\n\n\u201cMy actuaries took a hard look at Highmark\u2019s submitted rate request, and we were able to reduce it by 3.0%,\u201d said Commissioner Stewart. \u201cBut Blue Cross franchisees across the country are making requests for increases of 25% or more, claiming the Affordable Care Act has unleashed pent-up demand by persons who have not seen a doctor for years. Regulators have been approving significant rate increases throughout the country.\u201d\n\nBCBS plans have requested rate hikes greater than 30% in Oklahoma, Tennessee and Minnesota. Last month Blue Cross Blue Shield New Mexico pulled out of that state\u2019s healthcare exchange when denied a 51.6% increase.\n\nCommissioner Stewart said, \u201cI\u2019m continuing to meet with other insurance companies to persuade them to join Delaware\u2019s Health Insurance Marketplace and increase competition. Insurers have been discouraged by our state\u2019s high health care costs.\u201d According to a 2013 Wall Street Journal report[1] on health care spending nationwide, Delaware ranks third-highest in prescription drug costs, fourth in the cost of physician and clinical services, and ninth in the cost of hospital care.\n\nThe Department of Insurance held public information sessions in each county in June to receive comment on the proposed rate increases. Written comments can be found at the department\u2019s website. The department expects to post all of the rates on their website by October 15, 2015.
