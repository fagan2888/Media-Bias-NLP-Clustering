But what is the case for a Webb presidency?\n\nAccording to the Washington Post, Webb is pitching himself as someone who can shake up Washington\u2019s partisan gridlock. Webb argues that, through him, America can \u201creturn to a leadership environment where people from both political parties and from all philosophical points of view would feel compelled to work the common good.\u201d In this scenario people would \u201csort out their disagreements in a way that moves our country forward rather than tearing the fabric of the nation apart.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, Jim Webb is as unlikely as almost any public figure in America to build consensus among those with differing points of views. Stated differently, he is a nasty piece of work.\n\nIn November 2006, the Washington Post reported:\n\nAt a recent White House reception for freshman members of Congress, Virginia\u2019s newest senator tried to avoid President Bush. Democrat James Webb declined to stand in a presidential receiving line or to have his picture taken with the man he had often criticized on the stump this fall. But it wasn\u2019t long before Bush found him. \u201cHow\u2019s your boy?\u201d Bush asked, referring to Webb\u2019s son, a Marine serving in Iraq. \u201cI\u2019d like to get them out of Iraq, Mr. President,\u201d Webb responded, echoing a campaign theme. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I asked you,\u201d Bush said. \u201cHow\u2019s your boy?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s between me and my boy, Mr. President,\u201d Webb said coldly, ending the conversation on the State Floor of the East Wing of the White House.\n\nHenry Clay strongly opposed going to war with Mexico. James Polk defeated him for president in 1844 and the U.S. went to war. Clay became a leading anti-war critic. His favorite son was killed in action.\n\nYet Clay maintained good personal relations with Polk. In fact, their relations are said to have been warm during the latter days of Polk\u2019s presidency.\n\nClay, a gentleman, rarely put a wrong foot forward in public. The the notable exception was a tirade in a bar when he learned that the Whigs had rejected him in favor of William Henry Harrison at their 1840 convention (in those days presidential aspirants didn\u2019t attend their party\u2019s convention).\n\nWebb cannot be held to Clay\u2019s standard. But one should expect minimal civility from someone seeking the presidency on the theory that he can break gridlock by getting people to \u201csort out their disagreements in a way\u201d that doesn\u2019t strain \u201cthe fabric of the nation.\u201d That\u2019s not a job for a jerk like Webb.\n\nNor is there any other rationale, beyond personal ambition, that militates in favor of a presidential run by the former Senator, who is now on his third marriage. Webb is hardly a political dynamo. His only electoral victory was against George Allen in 2006. It came in a state that has trended Democratic, and in the context of a pro-Democrat wave election.\n\nEven so, Webb\u2019s margin of victory was extremely small. And but for Allen\u2019s use of the word \u201cmacaca,\u201d Webb certainly would have lost.\n\nWebb served six years in the Senate without distinction. His biggest contribution was his vote for Obamacare, without which the legislation would not have passed.\n\nWebb declined to stand for reelection in 2012. Perhaps he doubted he would win. Perhaps he was bored with public policy.\n\nNeither explanation commends him for the presidency. As former Virginia Governor Douglas Wilder told the Post, \u201cA lot of people will be asking, \u2018Is this the reason you didn\u2019t run for reelection, because you were still so concerned with the direction of the country?'\u201d\n\nWebb fancies himself a populist and at times has talked a pretty good game. This distinguishes him from Hillary Clinton, but not from a host of possible entrants with more credibility with the left. Bernie Sanders, Jerry Brown, and Elizabeth Warren come to mind.\n\nMoreover, Webb can\u2019t have it both ways. He can\u2019t appeal as a populist to the rabid Democratic left while claiming that he will heal the partisan divide. After all, Webb is no Barack Obama. Even President Obama is no Barack Obama.\n\nThat\u2019s why Steve is probably right in saying that Webb, although ideologically at home with the Democrats, better fits the independent/third part mold when it comes to presidential politics.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Power Line", "description": "Steve has commented on Jim Webb\u2019s decision to launch an \u201cexploratory committee\u201d for a possible presidential campaign.
