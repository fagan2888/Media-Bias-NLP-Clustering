Bernie Sanders among Democrats. He is reportedly willing to spend at least $1 billion of his own money on a campaign if he joins the race.\n\nRelated: Why Every Candidate in the 2016 Race Should Fear Mike Bloomberg\n\nThe 73-year-old is known best outside of the Big Apple for his campaigns against sugary drinks and guns. Below are a few other things that the rest of the country should know before backing or rejecting a Bloomberg run:\n\nMichael Rubens Bloomberg was born on Valentine\u2019s Day in 1942 in Brighton, Massachusetts.\n\nHe was raised in the Boston suburb of Medford, where he lived until he attended college.\n\nAs a boy, he attained the highest ranking within the Boy Scouts organization, making Eagle Scout.\n\nAfter attending Johns Hopkins University as an undergraduate and earning a degree in electrical engineering, Bloomberg received his MBA from Harvard Business School in 1996.\n\nHe was the first openly Jewish member of Hopkins\u2019 Phi Kappa Psi fraternity chapter.\n\nHe worked as a parking lot attendant in college to help pay for his tuition.\n\nRelated: If Michael Bloomberg Enters the Race, He Could Help Trump\n\nAfter earning his graduate school degree, Bloomberg applied to the Officer Candidate School of the U.S. Armed Forces in 1966, but wasn\u2019t accepted because he has flat feet.\n\nBloomberg\u2019s first job after business school was with Salomon Brothers as a trading room clerk. He became a partner in 1972, but was fired from the firm after it was bought in 1981.\n\nBloomberg used his severance package from Salomon Brothers to found his own company, called Innovative Market Systems, which focused on delivering financial information to Wall Street professionals via dedicated terminals. The company was renamed Bloomberg LP in 1987. In 2013, the company generated $8.3 billion in revenue and commanded around one third of the $25 billion market for financial data and analytics.\n\nIn 2002, Bloomberg was elected as the 108th mayor of New York. He was re-elected in November 2005 and then pushed through controversial legislation that would allow him to run for a third term on the grounds that his financial skills and experience were necessary to guide the city through a rough economic climate. He secured his third four-year term in November 2009.\n\nAs mayor, he took a salary of $1 a year.\n\nRelated: 15 Facts You Didn\u2019t Know About Donald Trump\n\nOriginally registered as a Democrat, Bloomberg became a Republican for his mayoral run in 2001. He then dropped his party registration in 2007 and became an Independent.\n\nWhile in office, Bloomberg banned smoking inside all NYC restaurants and bars in 2003. He then expanded the ban to include parks, beaches, marinas, boardwalks and pedestrian plazas in 2011.\n\nUnder his leadership, New York became the first city in the nation to ban restaurants from serving trans fats. He also implemented calorie counts on restaurant chain menus and fought against excess salt in restaurants and packaged food.\n\nHe was ridiculed nationwide for attempting to restrict sugary soft drinks to just 16 ounces. The New York Supreme Court later rejected the \u201csoda ban.\u201d\n\nAs mayor, Bloomberg\u2019s Spanish language skills \u2014 or, more accurately, his accent \u2014 became the subject of Internet mockery, even spawning a widely followed parody Twitter account.\n\nBloomberg returned to Bloomberg as CEO at the end of 2014.\n\nForbes ranks Bloomberg as the 14th richest person in the world and the 10th in the U.S. His net worth is $36.5 billion.\n\nBloomberg is variously listed as being 5\u20197\u201d or 5\u20198\u201d tall. Either way, he\u2019d be among the shortest presidents in U.S. history.\n\nRelated: Trump vs. Sanders?
