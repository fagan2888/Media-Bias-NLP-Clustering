But have you ever wondered just how many tears you shed month after month?\n\nDid you know you produce 96 gallons of saliva every year? That\u2019s equivalent to 1,024 bottles of beer. Did you know you shed 8.8 lbs. of skin in the same amount of time? That\u2019s about the average weight of a housecat.\n\nIn addition to saliva and skin, BuzzFeed created a video for YouTube that breaks down the amount of six other types of stuff the body produces within one year. The quantity of hair, skin, and saliva the body produces throughout its one-year lifetime may be surprising for many, especially because hair growth and salivating are mindless and involuntary functions.\n\nThe Body Produces The Following Quantities In One Year:\n\nHair: 6 in.\n\nNails: 1.5 in.\n\nSkin: 8.8 lbs.\n\nTears: 22 gal.\n\nSweat: 60 gal.\n\nSaliva: 96 gal.\n\nUrine: 133 gal.\n\nPoop: 360 lbs.\n\nIndividual cells have a finite lifespan, which means when they die the body replaces their absence with new cells. With 50 to 75 trillion cells in every body, a constant cycle of death and renewal are taking place throughout your hair, nails, and skin.\n\nWaste materials, such as urine and feces are a result of burning the food and drink we filter through our bodies. If the body didn\u2019t remove waste products, we\u2019d become poisoned by all the metabolic toxins, which would cause the kidneys and other organs to stop functioning and ultimately die.\n\nToxins also leave the body by means of sweating. Some toxins and waste products are diffused out through the sweat glands. Sweating is a natural and necessary bodily function used to cool off the body and get rid of excess heat from working muscles and warm temperatures. The body has over four million sweat glands found everywhere on the body except the lips.\n\nWhat happens to cells once the body dies?\n\nAt death, the heart stops beating and the body\u2019s cells and tissues stop receiving oxygen. Brain cells are the first to die within three to seven minutes. Bone and skin cells survive for a few days before they\u2019re starved out, followed by blood, which begins draining from capillaries and polling into the lower-lying portions of the body until full decomposition.\n\nAbout three hours after death, rigor mortis sets in, which is the stiffening of muscles. Although the body is considered medically deceased, the hair and nail follicles continue to cyclically grow and shed until complete decomposition takes place. Different cells die at different rates, and so long as the body produces glucose and is supplied with oxygen, the nails and hair will continue to grow. Once the supply stops, the body will expel the last amount of hair and nails from its follicles and the base of the nail called the germinal matrix.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "body, creates, pounds, skin, every, year, among, gallons, other, things", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The body produces huge quantities of cells every year without us even thinking about it.", "title": "Guess How Many Gallons Of Tears, Sweat, And Saliva You Produce Each Year [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/body-creates-pounds-skin-every-year-among-gallons-other-things-287432", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/10/pounds-skin-are-shed-every-year-among-other-things.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The body produces huge quantities of cells every year without us even thinking about it.", "title": "Guess How Many Gallons Of Tears, Sweat, And Saliva You Produce Each Year [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/body-creates-pounds-skin-every-year-among-gallons-other-things-287432", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/10/pounds-skin-are-shed-every-year-among-other-things.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/10/pounds-skin-are-shed-every-year-among-other-things.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Conditions", "published_time": "2014-06-10T12:13:03-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-10T12:13:02-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The body produces huge quantities of cells every year without us even thinking about it."}, "article_summary": "The quantity of hair, skin, and saliva the body produces throughout its one-year lifetime may be surprising for many, especially because hair growth and salivating are mindless and involuntary functions.\nThe Body Produces The Following Quantities In One Year:Hair: 6 in.\nWith 50 to 75 trillion cells in every body, a constant cycle of death and renewal are taking place throughout your hair, nails, and skin.\nIn addition to saliva and skin, BuzzFeed created a video for YouTube that breaks down the amount of six other types of stuff the body produces within one year.\nDifferent cells die at different rates, and so long as the body produces glucose and is supplied with oxygen, the nails and hair will continue to grow."}
