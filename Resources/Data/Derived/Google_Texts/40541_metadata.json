This met immediate criticism from Christine Ferguson, executive director of HealthSource RI, who said UnitedHealthcare\u2019s exchange would limit options.\n\n\u201cThere is an exchange that deals with individuals; those individuals get tax credits because they do not have access to affordable, employer-based coverage. The other is a small business exchange. You can choose Blue Cross, Neighborhood and United \u2013 and next year, Tufts,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWith United, the only option given to employer [and employees] is within United. So, any ability that we now have to use competition by allowing consumers to choose goes out the window.\u201d\n\nUnitedHealthcare of New England President and CEO Stephen Farrell dropped the news at the Health Insurance Small Employer Taskforce meeting on Jan. 28. The meeting included a panel discussion with Farrell, Mike Hudson, chief operating officer at Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Rhode Island, Brenda Whittle, vice president of Neighborhood Health Plan of Rhode Island, and Thomas Croswell, president and COO of Tufts Health Plan \u2013 executives from the health insurers that offer commercial health plans in Rhode Island.\n\nNew contract for state employees\n\nThe Chafee administration recently signed a new contract for current and retired state employees with UnitedHealthcare. The contract runs from Jan. 1, 2014, through Dec. 31, 2016. The state can renew it for up to two more years. The cost of the new contract is unknown because the state is self-insured. The contract only covers medical treatment. A separate agreement for prescriptions is being negotiated CVS Caremark.\n\nRichard Asinof broke the exchange story on his online weekly newsletter, ConvergenceRI. Asinof, who was at the meeting, is a journalist who most recently was the health care and life sciences contributing writer for Providence Business News.\n\n\u201cUnitedHealthcare\u2019s decision to open its own private exchange is in direct competition to Rhode Island\u2019s exchange. As Christine Ferguson, HealthSourceRI\u2019s executive director, said, it is all about the for-profit health insurer\u2019s efforts to increase market share,\u201d Asinof said.\n\n\u201cAt issue is not the state of Rhode Island\u2019s recent contract with state employees and retirees. What is at issue is how the state \u2013 and the R.I. General Assembly \u2013 will choose to provide future financial support for HealthSourceRI.\u201d\n\nAsinof believes UnitedHealthcare\u2019s decision to open its own private exchange provides the illusion of consumer choice \u2013 employers and employees can choose between different UnitedHealthcare products, but not from other insurance plans in the marketplace.\n\n\u201cUnitedHealthcare is the biggest health insurer and has made a business decision not to go into the exchanges because they see more profits in skimming off the best risks,\u201d said Robert McGarrah, AFL-CIO Office of Investment Counsel and healthcare benefit expert in Washington, DC.\n\n\u201cThey, together with their for-profit competitors, were the biggest opponents of Obamacare, secretly sending over $100 million to the US Chamber of Commerce and Tea Party opponents. Why? Because they didn't like the \u2018public option\u2019 that was soon eliminated in a deal with Obama.\u201d\n\nIn that regard, Farrell\u2019s announcement was a big surprise. Just before the consumer marketplace for insurance went live last year, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) wrote that big insurers such as UnitedHealthcare would avoid exchanges.\n\n\u201cThe insurance companies that are likely to draw attention on the exchanges\u2014 which are expected to enroll an estimated 7 million Americans in the first year\u2014are lesser- known, and in many cases will be offering comparatively lower rates. The biggest health insurers are eschewing many of the exchanges out of concern that many of the individuals who will purchase coverage need it because they have chronic illnesses or other medical conditions that are expensive to treat,\u201d write the WSJ.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act \u2013 often referred to as \u201cObamacare\u201d \u2013 companies with 50 or more workers are required to offer affordable health coverage or pay a penalty. Some companies are choosing to offer their employees health benefits via private exchanges \u2014 online insurance marketplaces that are separate from the federal system.\n\n\u201cWe have always maintained that this one-size-fits-all approach \u2013 a heavily-mandated approach \u2013 cannot possibly deliver the diversity and range of products that individuals and businesses are looking for,\u201d said Mike Stenhouse, CEO of the Rhode Island Center for Freedom.\n\n\u201cYou have to allow open competition. You have to allow businesses to determine which product best meets their needs.\u201d\n\nAsinof said the competition in the Rhode Island health insurance market is for small business customers.\n\n\u201cHealthSourceRI has launched \u2018full employee choice,\u2019 targeted at small businesses, as a way to introduce competition and consumer choice in the market to lower costs,\u201d Asinof said.\n\nStill, Stenhouse was perplexed by complaints from Ferguson and the push back from the business community.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re seeing the big picture. Business owners have been drinking the Kool Aid to think that only government knows how to put together low cost products.\n\nLet\u2019s have the competition. Let\u2019s see what happens.\u201d\n\nMessages to UnitedHealthcare seeking comment were not immediately returned.\n\nRelated Slideshow: New England\u2019s Healthiest States 2013\n\nThe United Health Foundation recently released its 2013 annual reoprt: America's Health Rankings, which provides a comparative state by state analysis of several health measures to provide a comprehensive perspective of our nation's health issues. See how the New England states rank in the slides below. Definitions All Outcomes Rank: Outcomes represent what has already occurred, either through death, disease or missed days due to illness. In America's Health Rankings, outcomes include prevalence of diabetes, number of poor mental or physical health days in last 30 days, health disparity, infant mortality rate, cardiovascular death rate, cancer death rate and premature death. Outcomes account for 25% of the final ranking. Determinants Rank: Determinants represent those actions that can affect the future health of the population. For clarity, determinants are divided into four groups: Behaviors, Community and Environment, Public and Health Policies, and Clinical Care. These four groups of measures influence the health outcomes of the population in a state, and improving these inputs will improve outcomes over time. Most measures are actually a combination of activities in all four groups. Diabetes Rank: Based on percent of adults who responded yes to the question \"Have you ever been told by a doctor that you have diabetes?\" Does not include pre-diabetes or diabetes during pregnancy. Smoking Rank: Based on percentage of adults who are current smokers (self-report smoking at least 100 cigarettes in their lifetime and currently smoke). Obesity Rank: Based on percentage of adults who are obese, with a body mass index (BMI) of 30.0 or higher. Source: http://www.americashealthrankings.org/ Prev Next 6.
