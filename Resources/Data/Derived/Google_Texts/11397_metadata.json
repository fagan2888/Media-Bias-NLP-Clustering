Families would be required to pay out of pocket an \u201caffordable and reasonable\u201d amount of tuition based on their financial situation.\n\nFor some low-income families, that would presumably mean that tuition is essentially zero -- or close to zero -- and the plan then envisions those students using the Pell Grant to cover expenses beyond tuition, like books, supplies and living costs.\n\nBut for families making more money, Clinton\u2019s plan appears to require students to pay an \u201caffordable\u201d amount based on their financial need. It\u2019s not clear, though, how Clinton would set those thresholds. Her campaign cited the current federal formula that calculates need based on students\u2019 responses to the Free Application for Federal Student Aid -- and said that the plan would make that formula more generous.\n\nThe Clinton Plan: Debt-Free Tuition at Public College The Sanders Plan: Tuition-Free Public College States would receive federal money to eliminate the need of some students to borrow to pay for tuition. Students would have to work 10 hours a week to participate. And families who could afford to chip in -- by some yet-to-be-determined metric -- would be required to pay. States would receive money from the federal government to eliminate tuition at public colleges and universities. All students would be eligible, regardless of income.\n\nRegardless of how the plan defines \u201caffordable\u201d payments, some wealthy families would likely end up picking up the full tab of their tuition at public colleges.\n\nThat stands in contrast to the Sanders plan, announced in May, which aims to create tuition-free public education. Under Sanders\u2019s proposal, the federal government would send money to states that agree to eliminate tuition and required fees at public colleges and universities for all students, regardless of income.\n\nFor low-income students who qualify for the maximum Pell Grant, Sanders\u2019s plan would require a public college to cover the student\u2019s full need, as defined by the current federal formula, up to the cost of attendance (but minus the value of the Pell Grant).\n\nThe Vermont Senator's legislation doesn\u2019t specify how colleges would have to charge other students from middle-income families who don\u2019t qualify for the maximum Pell Grant -- other than saying states have to put the new federal money toward eliminating tuition and fees (while also maintaining their own spending on higher education).\n\nBut wealthier families who could otherwise afford college would benefit from any across-the-board reductions or elimination of tuition at public colleges and universities.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a trade-off between simplicity and price,\u201d said Robert Kelchen, an assistant professor of education leadership, management and policy at Seton Hall University. \u201cSanders\u2019s program is very simple to understand -- tuition covered no matter what -- but he\u2019s subsidizing some people who Clinton would expect to pay.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing, Kelchen added. \u201cIt may subsidize higher-income students but it would also potentially increase economic diversity by getting higher-income students to go to public colleges instead of private colleges,\u201d he said.\n\nOther financial aid experts said that the Sanders plan\u2019s simplicity of calling for free tuition at public colleges across the board had some value.\n\n\u201cAs a message to students, simplicity has an impact on families,\u201d said Mark Kantrowitz, senior vice president and publisher at Edvisors. \u201cFree is easy to explain. One of the flaws of the Clinton plan is that it is very detailed and complicated, and the biggest part about college affordability is hard to explain -- what exactly does \u2018debt-free tuition\u2019 mean?\u201d\n\nStill, Kantrowitz said that neither Clinton's nor Sanders's plan goes far enough to help defray the full cost of college for students. And in both cases, he noted, the plans would be funded by tax hikes that are a political nonstarter with Republicans. He has an alternative debt-free college plan that would involve reshuffling the federal government\u2019s existing aid programs and sending money directly to colleges that agree to make their institution debt-free.\n\nBeth Akers, a fellow at the Brookings Institution, has been critical of the \u201cdebt-free\u201d college rhetoric because, she said, she\u2019s concerned it would move away from the nation\u2019s market-based system of higher education.\n\nClinton\u2019s plan, Akers said, does a better job of making sure some \u201cstudents still have skin in the game, that they are caring about the quality of the service.\u201d\n\nSandy Baum, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, who helped advise the Clinton campaign on its higher education plan, said that while in a perfect world public colleges might not charge tuition at all, Clinton's plan is \"carefully trying to focus\" on directing federal resources to students who need them most.\n\n\"The Clinton plan says that the people who go to college and can afford it are going to pay something. It's not 'tuition-free' for people who can afford to pay tuition,\" she said. \"I think that's a more realistic approach.\"\n\nBesides Clinton and Sanders, other Democratic candidates have been pushing their own higher education plans.\n\nFormer Maryland Governor Martin O\u2019Malley has outlined a proposal that he refers to as \u201cdebt-free college.\u201d It would follow a similar federal-state matching program model as the other plans, though his campaign documents don\u2019t make clear exactly how much different types of students would pay.\n\nIf Vice President Joe Biden were to make official the presidential bid that he\u2019s reportedly mulling, he would campaign while part of an administration that has been markedly less bullish on the \u201cdebt-free\u201d college concept. While Obama called for free community college earlier this year -- and Biden joined him to make the announcement in Knoxville, Tenn. -- the leadership of his Education Department has been far more tepid on proposals to make a four-year degree free.\n\nEducation Secretary Arne Duncan said last month that a \u201cdebt-free\u201d option at public colleges should be just one part of improving higher education and said that policy makers should expand their focus from student debt to accountability for outcomes.\n\nUnder Secretary of Education Ted Mitchell said earlier this summer that the administration believes that college \"affordability doesn\u2019t necessarily end up at zero.\"", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/08/27/clinton-sanders-united-call-more-federal-spending-higher-ed-vary-college", "image": "https://www.insidehighered.com/sites/all/themes/ihecustom/images/facebook_icon_large.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Nearly all the Democratic presidential hopefuls are pitching new federal college affordability programs -- how do they differ?", "title": "Clinton, Sanders united in call for more federal spending on higher ed, vary on college affordability approach"}, "msapplication-config": "/IEconfig.xml", "description": "Nearly all the Democratic presidential hopefuls are pitching new federal college affordability programs -- how do they differ?", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "follow, index"}, "article_summary": "The Clinton Plan: Debt-Free Tuition at Public College The Sanders Plan: Tuition-Free Public College States would receive federal money to eliminate the need of some students to borrow to pay for tuition.\n\"The Clinton plan says that the people who go to college and can afford it are going to pay something.\nOther financial aid experts said that the Sanders plan\u2019s simplicity of calling for free tuition at public colleges across the board had some value.\nStates would receive money from the federal government to eliminate tuition at public colleges and universities.\nBeth Akers, a fellow at the Brookings Institution, has been critical of the \u201cdebt-free\u201d college rhetoric because, she said, she\u2019s concerned it would move away from the nation\u2019s market-based system of higher education."}
