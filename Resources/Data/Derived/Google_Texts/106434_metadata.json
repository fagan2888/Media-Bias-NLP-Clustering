Strutton said many of the job openings are in Ca\u00f1on City.\n\nHe said at least a few employers will be conducting interviews on the spot.\n\n\"I would wear business-appropriate clothing,\" he said. \"It would be to the job seeker's advantage to be prepared ... and I would get there as soon as I could. It's kind of the early bird gets the worm kind of thing.\"\n\nThe fair includes full and part-time positions.\n\n\"All job seekers are invited to attend,\" he said. \"The jobs aren't just entry level.\"\n\nHe said staff will assist those who are looking for a job.\n\n\"We'll have staff at the front door that will make copies of resumes and copies of applications so that the job seekers ... can go to table to table and talk to the employers to see if there's any interest,\" Strutton said. \"If there is, they can hand them an application and a resume.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said the local work force center helps to make a connection between employers looking to fill positions and people looking for jobs.\n\nTo get fair applications before the event, visit the center, located at\n\n3224 Independence Road.\n\nThe event will be from 8 a.m. to noon Wednesday at The Abbey Events Complex, 2951 E.
