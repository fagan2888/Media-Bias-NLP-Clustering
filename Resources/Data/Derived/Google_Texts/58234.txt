Bay County's first 2016 baby is a boy.

At 1:43 PM on New Year's Day Casey Quesenberry and Brandon Dunford welcomed their first baby and the first-born 2016 baby in Bay County.

Jase Reid Dunford weighed in at a healthy six pounds, 13 ounces and 20.5 inches.

Jase was supposed to arrive last week, so Casey and Brandon did not think they would have a New Year's baby until they watched a certain movie.

Quesenberry explained, "Actually we watched a movie the other day, the New Year movie, and they were in the hospital and we thought 'Oh, I guess Jase would be born on New Year's,' we didn't even think about it until the movie came on."

"We're just happy, just so blessed that we have a healthy baby, that's the main thing and just ready to start the new year," Dunford added.

Casey and Brandon said they found out in the operating room that Jase was officially Bay County's first New Year's baby.
