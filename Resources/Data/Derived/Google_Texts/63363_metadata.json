(Photo: Ivan Marcio)\n\nYears ago, I was stood up on two separate occasions waiting to do a phone interview with B.B. King who probably napped through the whole ordeal each time. Unlike my usual conversational style of interview, I'd actually prepared a list of questions for the man we have come to know as \"Ambassador of the Blues.\" Sadly, given my past track record with him, we will probably never know if B.B. King's ambassadorship gets him any sort of diplomatic immunity. Or whether he would get a better table at restaurants than Memphis Slim who holds a Senate-approved Ambassador of Goodwill title.\n\nBut some 14 years later, I did get to ask a few of these stupid unused blues-based questions of Bob Corritiore who, if not an ambassador of the blues, is single-handedly the Valley of the Sun's most active advocate of the blues, as harmonica-playing bandleader, as record producer, as owner of the Rhythm Room and as radio host of KJZZ's \"Those Lowdown Blues.\" And Bob, ever the gentleman, answered them.\n\nThis Saturday at the MIM (Musical Instrument Museum), the Phoenician bluesman celebrates the release of his ninth CD, \"Taboo.\" The album features guest appearances by Jimmie Vaughan, Papa John DeFrancesco, Junior Watson, Fred Kaplan, Kedar Roy and Richard Innes. And the latter four names will be playing along with Bob at the \"Taboo\" album release show at the MIM.\n\nRecently \"Taboo\" has made the Blues Magazine's Best of 2014 list and has garnered a nomination for Germany's \"BiG Blues Award. Possibly the best accolade a harmonicat could hope for is some kind words from world-renowned harmonica player Charlie Musselwhite, who writes on the CD sleeve notes, \"Not many people can do an all-instrumental harp CD and keep it interesting all the way through. You've got a dandy CD here. A real treat.\"\n\nWhile the retro cover art evokes early-'60s exotica-bachelor pad nostalgia (Bob covers Arthur Lyman's \"Taboo\" as it might have sounded if it were recorded at Chess Records and someone left the birdcalls at home), it's still the traditional sound he has always championed, tempered with new sensibilities and a swanky after-hours vibe in tracks like \"Many a Devil's Night\" and \"Bob's Late Hours\" that make it the best last album to hear before you slip into bluesy unconsciousness.\n\nQuestion: \"Taboo\" looks like it's coming from a different place than your other albums. How did you approach it differently?\n\nAnswer: My other recordings are mostly partnering with vocalists. Since \"Taboo\" is all instrumental, it was a completely different form of expression. The harmonica as the lead instrument got to set the mood, create the conversation and explore new ground. It was also different because I partnered with some of the blues genre's most inventive musicians on it.\n\nIt's really a straight blues but as opposed to most of the CDs I have are really a down-home spin on blues but this one really takes it uptown, sometimes it goes to exotic places. because of that it has a different kind of appeal. So people who enjoy my prior works seem to be able to follow me there but then there's new people who have opened up to this record which is really exciting to me. There's a few magazines that have written about this CD who probably wouldn't have touched it if it was a more traditional release. Not that it's not based in traditional but it sounds like something you'd hear in the 1960s. It has a Sixties hipster vibe to it. It's got songs like \"Harmonica Watusi.\" The Potato Stomp\" and and \"5th Position Plea.\"\n\nQ: \"5th Position Plea?\" (insert dirty sniggering here)\n\nA: Don't you go there...5th Position is a position on the harmonica that nobody's ever made an instrumental out of. It's where you would play the two blow note as your tonic and it brings all these interesting little chord segments into play when you hit a certain way. It's an awkward position so you have to be very precise or you're gonna get in trouble. Some positions, you can play basically anything and it's still gonna be in key. It sounds like cool harmonica but it almost has a minor accordion edge to it.\n\nQ: Releasing any album in today's climate is a challenge, with people moaning about how no one buys physical product anymore but is that true in the blues idiom?\n\nA: The blues audience has been good to me as far as CD sales. I think it's a genre thing.\n\nQ: I get your newsletters and almost every week it seems another legendary blues player has passed. Is that going through your mind as a producer. like \"Say, I've got to get in the studio and put down what I've heard these greats do live that isn't represented or record?\"\n\nA: Yes so sad about all the passings. I have been blessed to be able to make records with most of my favorite players and yes I do feel the need to record the veterans whenever I can. My master tape vaults are filled with amazing material and much of it unreleased\n\nQ: Is there anybody that you haven't worked with yet that you'd like to ?\n\nA: There are lots of people who I have not worked with who I greatly admire. Mavis Staples is the first one that comes to mind. The cool thing about blues musicians is that we all tend to jam together if we are anywhere near a stage and an audience.\n\nQ: Does Phoenix have a regional blues sound? Could you pick it out if someone played you a Phoenix blues record from the '60s?\n\nA: Phoenix is a town that has always been a pass-through, to and from the West Coast. So many musical influences have landed here. That being said, there is a sound here that is unique to the great players around this area. Also great studios like Clarke Rigsby's Tempest Recording, where this CD was recorded, have a trademark studio sound. As far as the '50s and '60s sound, you should check out the compilation \"Flyin' High\" that John Dixon and I put together documenting that time period of Phoenix blues and R&B.\n\nQ: How healthy is our blues scene these days?\n\nA: Phoenix has a very strong and loyal blues following and it's really a fantastic home base for a performer that's lucky enough to perform here. People really come out.\n\nQ: Have you seen an influx of new fans with newer bands in town?\n\nA: It's always a pleasure when a band like the Sugar Thieves bring younger audiences into it. They've come into the blues from a slightly different perspective. Some of the old timers like Tommy Dukes, he grew up listening to B.B. King and Jimmy Reed, they're so much a part of his upbringing. But the Sugar Thieves, they came into it through an R. L. Burnside, Aretha Franklin, Tom Waits thing and they put it together in a rootsy blend that's their version of how blues should be played from that generation's perspective, which comes across as true and honest but different from the more traditional ways. It's fascinating to see young people come to that show and really respond to that. It's a cool thing.\n\nQ: Is there any crossover from that audience ?\n\nA: It does to a degree. I've got some people who are really young that come but overall I'm playing really old-school blues. There's always a group of people from a younger generation that seem to be wandering in and digging it. I've got a couple of fans who are harmonica students or just fancy the style of blues we play and recognize that it goes back to an old and deep well.\n\nQ: Is there a certain line of experimentation that the blues crosses that it's not the blues anymore? An album like Muddy Waters' \"Electric Mud,\" once you mess with the parameters does it just automatically get shunted off to rock?\n\nA: Blues is in the eyes of its beholder. Everyone draws the parameters differently. I prefer the traditional sound.\n\nQ: B.B. King is nicknamed the Ambassador to the Blues. Is there any honorary title you would like to have bestowed upon you?\n\nA: I am happy just being a part of this amazing worldwide blues scene. I am fine with my regular name. Nicknames can get confusing!\n\nRead or Share this story: http://azc.cc/1rtjzls", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Bob Corritore reflects on Phoenix blues scene and new album, \"Taboo.\"", "og": {"site_name": "azcentral", "description": "Bob Corritore reflects on Phoenix blues scene and new album, \"Taboo.\"", "title": "Plugging Into Phoenix: Bob Corritore releases 'Taboo'", "url": "http://www.azcentral.com/story/entertainment/music/2014/11/27/phoenix-tempe-local-music-scene-report/19582511/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/azcentral.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Bob Corritore reflects on Phoenix blues scene and new album, \"Taboo.\"", "title": "Plugging Into Phoenix: Bob Corritore releases 'Taboo'", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/dab110de8f479ee44c40dfe25f326b42ecc2566c/c=408-0-2856-2448&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Phoenix/Phoenix/2014/11/27/635526951056760009-066.jpg", "creator": "@azcentral", "site": "@azcentral", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600023563", "fb": {"app_id": 115142145268769}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Persons/Charlie Musselwhite", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Persons/Charlie Musselwhite", "title": "Plugging Into Phoenix: Bob Corritore releases 'Taboo'", "author": "Serene Dominic", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "entertainment/music", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/06ba27a0362a386e9000c02e5ad114cc3f2d85e9/c=714-0-2550-2448/local/-/media/Phoenix/Phoenix/2014/11/27/635526951056760009-066.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/70261845367a788a3f907a9f1f073a9c7298db27/c=408-0-2856-2448/local/-/media/Phoenix/Phoenix/2014/11/27/635526951056760009-066.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/519e70b3dd198a728f9efe74a59e76efcbe622d3/c=4-0-3260-2448/local/-/media/Phoenix/Phoenix/2014/11/27/635526951056760009-066.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/abf7fc9e077790e137c6a86512b8396963a5a375/c=0-302-3264-2146&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/Phoenix/Phoenix/2014/11/27/635526951056760009-066.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-11-27T12:25:42.363000-07:00", "shorthed": "Plugging Into Phoenix: Bob Corritore 'Taboo' Album Release at MIM", "articleid": 19582511, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6d46f0a03148c87ce3989a311abc6d55d0153ee9/c=0-302-3264-2146/local/-/media/Phoenix/Phoenix/2014/11/27/635526951056760009-066.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/80bc2c6d6bcf6351394bb3af892ba4acb199efd5/c=947-0-2318-2448/local/-/media/Phoenix/Phoenix/2014/11/27/635526951056760009-066.jpg"}}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd2ae\"", "article_summary": "This Saturday at the MIM (Musical Instrument Museum), the Phoenician bluesman celebrates the release of his ninth CD, \"Taboo.\"\nAnd the latter four names will be playing along with Bob at the \"Taboo\" album release show at the MIM.\nCould you pick it out if someone played you a Phoenix blues record from the '60s?\nRecently \"Taboo\" has made the Blues Magazine's Best of 2014 list and has garnered a nomination for Germany's \"BiG Blues Award.\nI prefer the traditional sound."}
