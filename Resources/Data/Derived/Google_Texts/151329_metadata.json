But the real 2016 news was just how badly three prominent Republican aspirants were doing: the once dominant Chris Christie, who\u2019s arguably just seen the last three nails in his coffin; Marco Rubio, whose high-profile global warming denialism seems to have come at just the wrong time; and Rand Paul, with his one-step-forward, two-steps-back move on voter ID laws.\n\nTuesday, I wrote about Chris Christie\u2019s doomed campaign prospects, beset by woes on three fronts: damning evidence from the mouth of his own press secretary at ongoing legislative hearings that he tried to cover up the Bridgegate scandal; the sixth bond downgrade of his administration (and third of the year) signaling his failure on the economic front; and the fresh, still-unfolding pay-to-play scandal first broken by David Sirota. But just because Christie\u2019s prospects are so dire doesn\u2019t mean that anyone else\u2019s look that good, either, over on the GOP side.\n\nChristie\u2019s plummeting fortunes are widely seen as indications that the GOP establishment is in trouble, and it clearly lacks any obvious candidate to rally around. But it\u2019s not as if any GOP candidate has really promising prospects \u2014 even to get the nomination, much less win the general election. No candidate in Real Clear Politics poll tracking has cracked 20 percent since Chris Christie did it twice back in November, just after his reelection. No candidate is currently above 13 percent in RCP\u2019s polling average (Paul and Huckabee are tied for the lead, trailed by Jeb Bush at 12.3 percent).\n\nThe travails of Rubio and Paul this past week or so are illustrative of a much more general problem: The GOP base\u2019s increasing political isolation makes it virtually impossible for anyone who wins the primary to have a chance at winning the White House. And yet, even the slightest awareness of the general electorate can trip up candidates in their primary run. Rubio (who once supported cap-and-trade, before flip-flopping in his Senate race against Charlie Crist) showed his stuff on climate change denial last week, and the results were not pretty. Nor were things much better with Paul\u2019s modest criticism of the GOP \u201cgoing crazy\u201d with voter ID laws. Rubio was trying to tack hard right, while still seeming reasonable \u2014 but he didn\u2019t. Paul was trying to seem reasonable, which he sort of did, until it became clear he had no intention of challenging the laws themselves.\n\nRubio\u2019s problems began with his comments on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d The question put to Rubio by Jonathan Karl was refreshingly direct: \u201cMiami, Tampa, are two of the cities most affected by climate change. So putting aside your disagreement with what to do about it, do you agree on the science on this? How big a threat is climate change?\u201d Rubio ducked a direct answer to the question, and was off to the weasel-word races:\n\nRubio: I don\u2019t agree with the notion that some are putting out there including scientists, that somehow, there are actions we can take today that would actually have an impact on what\u2019s happening in our climate. Our climate is always changing. And what they have chosen to do is take a handful of decades of research and say this is now evidence of a longer term trend that is directly and almost solely attributable to man made activity\u2026. Karl: You don\u2019t buy that\u2026 Rubio: I don\u2019t know of any era in world history where climate has been stable. Climate is always evolving. And natural disasters have always existed\u2026. Karl: But let me get this straight. You do not think that human activity, the production of CO2, has caused warming to our planet? Rubio: I do not believe that human activity is causing these dramatic changes to our climate the way these scientists are portraying it. That\u2019s what I\u2014and I do not believe that the laws that they propose we pass will do anything about it, except it will destroy our economy.\n\nThere\u2019s so much misdirection and obfuscation here, one might be tempted to call Rubio a master, except this is just a fairly standard regurgitation of a few of a denialist\u2019s more polished talking points. See Climate Progress, DeSmogBlog and Jonathan Chait for a sampling of the criticism Rubio drew online. Under the headline \u201cA Politician in Denial,\u201d his home state Tampa Bay Tribune editorialized the next day. It quoted the first paragraph above, and then said:\n\nThat is a politician in denial who is not up to responsibly tackling a complicated, serious challenge facing the nation and the world. With nothing credible to bolster his position, Rubio rejects the latest assessment by dozens of scientists working over five years \u2014 and the stacks of earlier reports and studies that pointed toward the same conclusion. This is not the sophisticated, critical thinking voters expect from the nation\u2019s leader. The senator trails evolving public opinion among voters who have more respect for established science and what they see with their own eyes than the senator does.\n\nCutting through all that nonsense on Tuesday at the National Press Club, an audience member asked, via a moderator, \u201cWhat information, reports, studies or otherwise are you relying on to inform and reach your conclusion that human activity is not to blame for climate change?\u201d And Rubio could not name a single supporting source of evidence.\n\nInstead, Rubio went right back into his standard evasion mode, first uttering two mutually canceling irrelevancies. \u201cWell, again, headlines notwithstanding, I\u2019ve never disputed that the climate is changing, and I\u2019ve pointed out that climate to some extent is always changing, it\u2019s never static,\u201d Rubio began. He then pulled out his ace in the hole: \u201cThat\u2019s not the question before me as a policymaker,\u201d and he was off talking about the futility of banning all coal in the U.S. \u2014 as if that was the question before him.\n\nThis has long been a Rubio favorite, apparently, using his non-scientist status as an excuse to ignore science entirely. Back in 2012, Rubio refused to give an answer when GQ asked, \u201cHow old do you think the Earth is?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not a scientist, man,\u201d he said, instead of answering. \u201cI\u2019m not a scientist. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m qualified to answer a question like that.\u201d\n\nYet Rubio did feel qualified to opine that \u201cthe laws that they propose we pass \u2026 will destroy our economy,\u201d and economics also claims to be a science. Contrary to Rubio\u2019s claims on this score, as I pointed out last weekend, a new report from the International Energy Agency, \u201cEnergy Technology Perspectives 2014,\u201d finds that cost savings in energy will far exceed the cost of investments to rapidly shift away from carbon-based energy. The press release explained:\n\nThe report finds that an additional $44 trillion in investment is needed to secure a clean-energy future by 2050, but this represents only a small portion of global GDP and is offset by over $115 trillion in fuel savings. The new estimate compares to $36 trillion in the previous ETP analysis, and the increase partly shows something the IEA has said for some time: the longer we wait, the more expensive it becomes to transform our energy system.\n\nIn short, Rubio\u2019s got the economics exactly backward, too. Perhaps he should just have said, \u201cI\u2019m not an economist, man. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m qualified to answer a question like that.\u201d\n\nBut, like the climate, things change. In fact, the very next day, as reported by Politico, Rubio appeared on Sean Hannity\u2019s show:\n\n[T]he Florida senator brushed off a backlash labeling him as a climate-change denier by aggressively accusing left-leaning critics as hypocrites given their abortion rights positions. He said emphatically that the \u201cscience is settled\u201d that life begins at conception but that liberals \u201cwill never admit\u201d to it. \u201cLet me give you a bit of settled science that they\u2019ll never admit to. The science is settled, it\u2019s not even a consensus, it is a unanimity, that human life begins at conception,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cSo I hope the next time someone wags their finger about science, they\u2019ll ask one of these leaders on the left: \u2018Do you agree with the consensus of science that human life begins at conception?\u2019\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a proven fact,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cThat\u2019s a scientific consensus they choose to ignore.\u201d\n\nSo, it looks like Rubio is a scientist, man, after all \u2014 but a damn bad one at that, as Tara Culp-Ressler explained at Think Progress:\n\nIf Rubio is trying to use abortion politics to prove that he and his Republican colleagues have a clear grasp of science, though, he waded into the wrong issue area. Although \u201clife begins at conception\u201d is certainly a deeply held religious belief for many Americans, including the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, the concept of \u201clife\u201d here actually has more to do with philosophy than it does with science. As Jodi Jacobson points out at RH Reality Check, \u201cthe phrase is highly \u2014 and purposefully \u2014 misleading because it confuses simple biological cell division both with actual pregnancy and with actual, legal personhood, which are all very different things.\u201d When scientists talk about conception, they use terms that are more medically specific than \u201clife.\u201d The current definitions relate to fertilization, implantation, and when a woman is officially considered to be pregnant.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Two front-runners have a bad week on voter ID and climate change.
