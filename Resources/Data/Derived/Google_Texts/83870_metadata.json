The passage of time is inevitable, but you can distract yourself from its depredations by cycling through the songs below, one for each month of the year you\u2019re going to have to get through like every other.\n\nAvett Brothers, \u201cJanuary Wedding\u201d\n\nThe Avett Brothers have kicked around alt country circles for a while, gamely hovering on the verge of next-big-thing. \u201cJanuary Wedding\u201d is from their 2009 Rick Rubin-produced major label debut \u201cI And Love and You.\u201d This live performance, complete with true believers in the audience letting loose with pig-calling yodels, nicely captures their charm. They\u2019re ragged hillbillies twanging away at sensitive indie pop, or maybe sensitive indie geniuses knee-deep in country. Either way, it\u2019s a good, simple marriage to start off the year.\n\nRitsu Katsumata, \u201cRobot Dance/February\u201d\n\nRitsu Katsumata was a childhood classical violin prodigy, but as an adult she decided she wanted to rock. So she entered the Seattle Bumbershoot Festival Jimi Hendrix Guitar Competition only to be disqualified in the finals for playing the wrong instrument. Undeterred, she formed her own power trio. You can hear Hendrix\u2019s psychedelic fire squalling through this 2004 track from Katsumata\u2019s album \u201cFebruary,\u201d both in the swaggering thrash of the very non-robotic \u201cRobot Dance,\u201d and in the lyrical \u201cFebruary.\u201d As a bonus, this live electric violin tribute to Hendrix and Jimmy Page is pretty spectacular. Bleeding ears will be your Valentine.\n\nCarter Family, \u201cMarch Winds Gonna Blow My Blues Away\u201d\n\nA great classic Carter Family track, with the famous Carter harmonies and the even more famous rhythmically dexterous strum of Maybelle\u2019s guitar. The band seems indifferent to the exigencies of weather; a harsh March blast might trouble some, but the Carters trundle on with the same jaunty drone as ever, celebrating dour exuberance at the turning of the season. Keep on the sunny side, March.\n\nThelonious Monk, \u201cApril in Paris\u201d\n\nThere are lots of famous versions of this one, including the expansively cheesy 1955 Count Basie recording, a glorious take by Sarah Vaughan and Clifford Brown and Monk\u2019s own 1940s small group setting. But I think his solo piano version is my favorite. I\u2019m not sure when this recording is from, but Monk sounds great; the smooth standard turned into a kind of strolling, staggering lurch through the streets, as if nostalgic recollection keeps getting interrupted by sudden downpours or sharp blows to the head. At a couple of points you can hear Monk muttering to himself as he thumps along, all spaces and hesitations and rhythmic confoundment, spring as vertigo.\n\nMalfunkshun, \u201cRains of May\u201d\n\nSometimes referred to as the grandfathers of grunge, Malfunkshun are best known as the band of Andrew Wood, who went on to form Mother Love Bone. This is a latter-day single from 2012, long after their \u201980s heyday, with singer Jeff Loftis replacing the sadly deceased Wood on vocals. \u201cRains of May\u201d doesn\u2019t have the mud-slogging cool of the original line-up. Instead, it\u2019s as much hair-metal as grunge; decadent riff-heavy retro-rawk. Hold up your lighters and enjoy the fact that Malfunkshun appears to think that August is the month that comes after May.\n\nMr. Del and Holy South, \u201cMemphis in June\u201d\n\nDel was originally in Three 6 Mafia before he got religion; this one is from his 2007 album \u201cHoly South: Kingdom Crunk.\u201d The sample voice repeating \u201cMemphis in June\u201d is sped up till it sounds like it\u2019s being sung by the Chipmunks, but I think it\u2019s from Nina Simone\u2019s famous performance of the Hoagy Carmichael tune, also titled \u201cMemphis in June.\u201d That song\u2019s evocation of a pastoral, sleepy Southern summer is largely abandoned. Instead, lines about \u201cSweet oleander blowing perfume in the air everywhere\u201d in the idiom of jazz-pop are replaced with name-checking of Al Green, Isaac Hayes and Martin Luther King in the idiom of crunked-out Christian hip-hop. Out with the old nostalgia, in with the new nostalgia, delivered with some righteous Southern summer sweat.", "article_metadata": {"description": "From \"January Wedding\" on, these month-themed songs let you make a musical calendar VIDEO", "title": "12 great songs to get you through the year", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "From \"January Wedding\" on, these month-themed songs let you make a musical calendar VIDEO", "title": "12 great songs to get you through the year", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/01/18/12_great_songs_to_get_you_through_the_year/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/avett_brothers.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "From \"January Wedding\" on, these month-themed songs let you make a musical calendar VIDEO", "title": "12 great songs to get you through the year", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/avett_brothers.jpg", "creator": "@hoodedu", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Noah Berlatsky", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Music, songs, Video", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda2c3\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Music, songs, Video, Entertainment NewsAs we do every year, we\u2019re heading from January into February, and on toward spring and tax time and other seasonal repetitive annoyances.\nCarter Family, \u201cMarch Winds Gonna Blow My Blues Away\u201dA great classic Carter Family track, with the famous Carter harmonies and the even more famous rhythmically dexterous strum of Maybelle\u2019s guitar.\nRitsu Katsumata, \u201cRobot Dance/February\u201dRitsu Katsumata was a childhood classical violin prodigy, but as an adult she decided she wanted to rock.\nAvett Brothers, \u201cJanuary Wedding\u201dThe Avett Brothers have kicked around alt country circles for a while, gamely hovering on the verge of next-big-thing.\nThey\u2019re ragged hillbillies twanging away at sensitive indie pop, or maybe sensitive indie geniuses knee-deep in country."}
