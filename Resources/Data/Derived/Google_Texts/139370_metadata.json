She denied a motion by the doctor\u2019s employer and Fairview to dismiss the case.\n\nNelson\u2019s 63-page ruling is believed to be the first extensive federal court analysis of Section 1557 of the 2010 Affordable Care Act. The provision prohibits discrimination by health care providers and is the first federal civil rights law barring sex discrimination in health care.\n\nFairview attorneys dispute the applicability of the federal statute and noted in court documents that Rumble was not denied care.\n\nBoth the hospital and the organization employing the emergency room physician, Emergency Physicians Professional Association (EPPA), declined to comment this week, citing pending litigation.\n\nBut Chad Strathman, EPPA\u2019s attorney, stated, \u201cFor over 40 years, EPPA\u2019s emergency providers have proudly cared for members of the Twin Cities community. Our group takes patient concerns seriously.\u201d\n\nSince the 2013 incident, Rumble says he has feared making visits alone to health providers.\n\n\u201cI was traumatized by the whole experience,\u201d Rumble said in an interview. He\u2019s identified in court documents as a \u201cfemale-to-male transgender man.\u201d\n\nThe suit said Rumble\u2019s female reproductive organs were inflamed and he could hardly walk, despite antibiotic treatment by his primary care physician. At one point, he had a temperature of 104 degrees, and a doctor later said he could have died without treatment.\n\nRumble said he registered at the Fairview Southdale ER on June 22, 2013, identifying himself as a male, but he was told by a clerk he was on file as a female. She gave him a wristband with an \u201cF\u201d on it.\n\n\u201cI was very upset,\u201d said Rumble. \u201cMy identity was disregarded. It wasn\u2019t like I hadn\u2019t explained it.\u201d\n\nWhen an ER doctor showed up after 4\u00bd hours, he asked Rumble in a \u201chostile and aggressive manner \u2026 who are you having sex with?\u201d the suit alleges. Rumble asked what he meant, and the doctor asked, \u201cmen, women or both?\u201d\n\nRumble said the doctor seemed angry. He asked Rumble if he engaged in penetration and if \u201che had ever had sex with objects.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was in my face asking very personal questions and very repetitive questions about my sex life,\u201d said Rumble in a Star Tribune interview.\n\nThe doctor examined Rumble\u2019s genitalia \u201cin a very rough manner,\u201d the suit says. At one point, Rumble claimed he felt like he\u2019d been stabbed. He said he cried out in pain and asked the doctor to stop, but he didn\u2019t.\n\nThe suit says Rumble turned to his mother and said, \u201cMom, can you make him stop?\u201d His mother yelled, \u201cStop!\u201d and the doctor complied.\n\nWhen Rumble asked if he had determined the problem, the doctor allegedly said in an angry voice, \u201cI can\u2019t tell you because your mom made me stop the exam.\u201d He then left the room. Rumble was admitted two hours later.\n\nFearful about how he would be treated, Rumble asked his mother not to leave. She slept on a chair in his room for the next six days, the suit said.\n\nWeeks after he left the hospital, he got a bill stating, \u201cDiagnosis inconsistent with the patient\u2019s gender.\u201d\n\nJudge: \u2018This is the first case\u2019\n\nIn her ruling that the case should go forward, Judge Nelson wrote, \u201cTo the court\u2019s knowledge, this is the first case that requires an interpretation of Section 1557.\u201d\n\nNelson said Rumble\u2019s alleged treatment constitutes \u201cunprofessional behavior\u201d and a fact-finder could infer discriminatory intent.\n\nThe doctor\u2019s \u201ccomments and hostile questioning about plaintiff\u2019s sexual activities,\u201d Nelson wrote, \u201ccoupled with his disregard for Rumble\u2019s repeated request for [the doctor] to stop the painful physical examination demonstrate that the alleged mistreatment plaintiff endured was because of Rumble\u2019s gender identity.\u201d\n\nAddressing the suit\u2019s claim that the doctor\u2019s exam was \u201cassaultive,\u201d Nelson wrote, \u201cWhen any individual permits a doctor to conduct a genital exam, the patient is in a physically vulnerable position, which the doctor controls.\n\n\u201cHere Rumble had a reasonable expectation that his treating doctor at the [ER] would not physically \u2018assault\u2019 him, or at the very least would stop an intrusive and painful genital exam when asked to stop.\u201d\n\nAdvocates applaud analysis\n\nGroups that defend transgender persons applauded Nelson\u2019s legal analysis.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful interpretation,\u201d said Sasha Buchert, staff attorney with the Transgender Law Center in Oakland, Calif. \u201cFor the first time a federal court has determined that the Affordable Care Act prohibits discrimination against transgender people by a health care provider.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are very excited about the decision,\u201d said Kyle Palazzolo, staff and HIV project attorney for LAMBDA Legal. The national group advocates for LGBT civil rights.\n\nLAMBDA has issued a report on a 2009 national survey of 4,916 LGBT people. Nearly 21 percent of transgender people said health care professionals used \u201chard, abusive language\u201d and 7.8 percent of transgender people said health care professions were \u201cphysically rough or abusive.\u201d\n\nSome Twin Cities medical programs provide sensitive, quality care to transgender people, said Ellie Krug, an attorney with the Minnesota advocacy group Call for Justice. She said there are fewer problems in the metro area than in outstate Minnesota.\n\nRumble\u2019s suit was filed by attorneys Christy Hall, Lisa Stratton and Jill Gaulding, who belong to Gender Justice, a St. Paul nonprofit group, and Katherine Barrett Wiik of the Robins Kaplan law firm.\n\nRumble, a student at Minneapolis Community & Technical College, came out as a transgender male when he was 15 and has been active in causes for transgender youth.\n\nHe said he was nervous about filing a suit in which he had to publicly disclose the personal details of the hospital visit. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want this to happen to other trans people,\u201d he said. \u201cSo whatever it takes.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A judge ruled this week that the man has built a \"plausible\" case that he was a victim of discrimination and mistreatment by a Fairview Southdale emergency room doctor on the basis of gender identity.", "og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "A judge ruled this week that the man has built a \"plausible\" case that he was a victim of discrimination and mistreatment by a Fairview Southdale emergency room doctor on the basis of gender identity.", "title": "Judge says transgender man has plausible case he was mistreated at hospital", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/judge-says-transgender-man-has-case-he-was-mistreated-at-hospital/296930741/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_142680303493738.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_142680303493738.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A judge ruled this week that the man has built a \"plausible\" case that he was a victim of discrimination and mistreatment by a Fairview Southdale emergency room doctor on the basis of gender identity.", "title": "Judge says transgender man has plausible case he was mistreated at hospital", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/judge-says-transgender-man-has-case-he-was-mistreated-at-hospital/296930741/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_142680303493738.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_142680303493738.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "article": {"tag": "health care"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "news_keywords": "transgender,health care"}, "article_summary": "The provision prohibits discrimination by health care providers and is the first federal civil rights law barring sex discrimination in health care.\nRumble asked what he meant, and the doctor asked, \u201cmen, women or both?\u201dRumble said the doctor seemed angry.\nFearful about how he would be treated, Rumble asked his mother not to leave.\nNearly 21 percent of transgender people said health care professionals used \u201chard, abusive language\u201d and 7.8 percent of transgender people said health care professions were \u201cphysically rough or abusive.\u201dSome Twin Cities medical programs provide sensitive, quality care to transgender people, said Ellie Krug, an attorney with the Minnesota advocacy group Call for Justice.\nNelson ruled this week that Rumble, who identifies himself as a transgender man, has built a \u201cplausible\u201d case that he was a victim of discrimination and mistreatment by an emergency room doctor on the basis of gender identity."}
