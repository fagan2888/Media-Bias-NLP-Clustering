In theory, a mind trapped in the human body could be freed of its corporeal prison, of particular interest to Hawking, who was diagnosed at age 21 with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a debilitating motor neuron disease doctors said would quickly kill him.\n\n\"I think the brain is like a programme in the mind, which is like a computer, so it's theoretically possible to copy the brain onto a computer and so provide a form of life after death,\u201d Hawking told reporters. \"However, this is way beyond our present capabilities. I think the conventional afterlife is a fairy tale for people afraid of the dark.\"\n\nThe film tells the story of Hawking\u2019s life, beginning with his childhood in Oxford to his present home in Cambridge, where he lives with the assistance of caregivers. The world's best known scientist, Hawking discusses the limitations his condition has placed on him for nearly a half-century. \"Keeping an active mind has been vial to my survival, as has been maintaining a sense of humour,\u201d Hawking says.\n\nAt the premier on Thursday, Hawking\u2019s close friend Kip Thorne, an American physicist, paid tribute to the author of A Brief History of Time. The book, a synopsis of the universe that captured the world\u2019s imagination, has sold 10 million copies and has been translated into 40 languages.\n\n\"I think his handicap allowed him to do science he may not otherwise have done,\u201d Thorne said. \"He is the most stubborn man I know and that stubbornness and that drive is in part motivated by his disability.\"\n\nAside from making the most of his life with trips to gentlemen\u2019s clubs, Hawkings has inculcated a reputation as a sterling conversationalist, capable of chatting about everything and nothing, according to the film\u2019s director, Stephen Finnigan. \"[Hawking] was very different from how I imagined him to be. You expect him to be quite plain-speaking, quite academic and quite brainy, but actually you can have a laugh with Stephen Hawking,\u201d Finnigan told reporters.\"I went for a curry with him this afternoon and you can chat to him about anything.\"\n\nDespite a focus on possible immortality, however, Hawking reveals his true feelings about the afterlife with his latest book and autobiography, My Brief History.\n\nBelow is a video profile on Stephen Hawking's life.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "stephen hawking, stephen hawking's autobiography, stephen hawking and digital immortality", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Cosmologist Stephen Hawking, 71, predicts \"digital immortality\" for humanity's future, in which disembodied minds inhabit a digital universe, while promoting his autobiography and a biographical film.", "title": "Stephen Hawking Predicts 'Digital Immortality' For The Human Race", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/stephen-hawking-predicts-digital-immortality-human-race-257523", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/21/stephenhawking.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Cosmologist Stephen Hawking, 71, predicts \"digital immortality\" for humanity's future, in which disembodied minds inhabit a digital universe, while promoting his autobiography and a biographical film.", "title": "Stephen Hawking Predicts 'Digital Immortality' For The Human Race", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/stephen-hawking-predicts-digital-immortality-human-race-257523", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/21/stephenhawking.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/21/stephenhawking.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Science/Tech", "published_time": "2013-09-21T16:17:38-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-21T16:17:37-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Cosmologist Stephen Hawking, 71, predicts \"digital immortality\" for humanity's future, in which disembodied minds inhabit a digital universe, while promoting his autobiography and a biographical film."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce7f9\"", "article_summary": "Physicist Stephen Hawking predicts humanity will someday be immortalized, not on commemorative plates or in museum exhibits, but as living beings inhabiting a digital domain of disembodied minds.\nBelow is a video profile on Stephen Hawking's life.\nYou expect him to be quite plain-speaking, quite academic and quite brainy, but actually you can have a laugh with Stephen Hawking,\u201d Finnigan told reporters.\nDespite a focus on possible immortality, however, Hawking reveals his true feelings about the afterlife with his latest book and autobiography, My Brief History.\n\"Keeping an active mind has been vial to my survival, as has been maintaining a sense of humour,\u201d Hawking says."}
