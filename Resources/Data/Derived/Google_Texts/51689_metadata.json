Millions have lost their health-insurance plans due to Obamacare; millions more have seen their premiums and deductibles increase. The labor-force-participation rate is at historic lows and a record 92 million Americans \u2013 nearly 10 million more than when Obama took office \u2014 are not in the workforce. The 16 million Americans who\u2019ve gone on food stamps since the president took office bring the total to 48 million, or one in seven Americans, dependent on the government for food. The poverty rate has spiked 32 percent. The national debt stands at 17.3 trillion, more than 7 trillion more than when candidate Obama declared the debt unpatriotic. Iraq is in chaos, Iran is on the verge of getting a nuke, and almost every other administration initiative in the Middle East has been a debacle. Despite the Herculean efforts of the administration\u2019s praetorian guards in the mainstream media, Americans are not happy about Benghazi, the NSA, or the IRS. Every political prognosticator not on the DNC\u2019s payroll declares that Republicans are delicately poised on the cusp of taking control of the senate.\n\nAnd yet, according to a flurry of news reports in the last week, House Republicans are about to tackle the one issue polling at the very bottom ( 3 percent according to Gallup) of voters\u2019 concerns: immigration reform. And Republicans are about to do so in a way guaranteed to rile the base and depress GOP voter turnout in November \u2014 by granting amnesty to illegal immigrants.\n\nMake no mistake \u2014 the central features of the proposed \u201creform\u201d constitute amnesty.
