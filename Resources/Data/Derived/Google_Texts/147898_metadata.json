Lindsey Graham said Sunday there is a \u201c91 percent\u201d chance he will seek the Republican nomination in 2016, saying he is a proven Capitol Hill problem solver who has \u201cgot something to offer.\u201d\n\nThe South Carolina Republican signaled his intentions from New Hampshire, where the GOP\u2019s presidential hopefuls congregated this weekend to court voters in the vital primary state.\n\nHis confidence surprised \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d host Chris Wallace, who asked if the senator was being serious.\n\n\u201cYeah, I think so. I\u2019ve got to put the means together,\u201d Mr. Graham said.\n\nHis comments come after fellow Republican Carly Fiorina, a former business executive, said there\u2019s a \u201c90 percent\u201d chance she will run.\n\nThree other Republican senators \u2014 Ted Cruz of Texas, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Marco Rubio of Florida \u2014 have officially entered the contest.\n\nMr. Graham said Mr. Rubio will be president one day, whether it is in 2016 or sometime later.\n\n\u201cI like Marco,\u201d he said.\n\nFor his part, Mr. Graham knows that a serious run would take him through his home state, the third major prize along the primary route.\n\n\u201cIf I didn\u2019t think I could win South Carolina, I wouldn\u2019t be talking to you [about the race],\u201d he told Mr. Wallace.\n\nThe senator is likely to ride his bona fides as a defense hawk and leading critic of President Obama\u2019s approach to the Islamic State, Syria\u2019s civil war and an emerging nuclear deal with Iran.\n\nMr. Graham said the president is heading down a dead-end road with Iran, as Capitol Hill moves to have a say in the pact.\n\n\u201cI think Barack Obama\u2019s deal is deteriorating before our eyes,\u201d he said, adding there\u2019s not a \u201csnowball\u2019s chance\u201d the current deal would earn Congress\u2019 blessing.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sen.
