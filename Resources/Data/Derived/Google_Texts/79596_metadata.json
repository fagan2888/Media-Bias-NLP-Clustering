Other topics tackled included immunization exemptions and student loan repayment.\n\n\n\nIn a Sept. 28 reference committee hearing at the 2015 Congress of Delegates, Oregon delegate Glenn Rodriguez, M.D., of Milwaukie, speaks in support of a resolution addressing the availability of affordable medication for patients.\n\nAffordable Medication\n\nDuring the Reference Committee on Advocacy hearing on Sept. 28, family physicians discussed a pair of closely related resolutions that addressed the availability of affordable pharmaceuticals. The conversation was sparked, in part, by the recent news that Turing Pharmaceuticals had acquired the drug pyrimethamine (Daraprim) and immediately increased its price from $13.50 to $750 per tablet -- a jump of more than 5,000 percent. Oregon delegate Glenn Rodriguez, M.D., of Milwaukie, testified in support of both resolutions, one of which the Oregon AFP had submitted. \"Our efforts to deliver the triple aim are overwhelmed by some of the other cost drivers in the system, and one of the biggest right now is pharmaceutical prices,\" he said. \"We purposely asked for investigation into this pattern of profiteering -- because that is what this is. I think our voice is really important to speak up against this profiteering.\" Rodriguez said that during his recent training on Medicare fraud, waste and abuse, abuse was defined as \"anything that results in unnecessary cost that is not consistent with best patient care and professional standards and is priced unfairly.\"\n\nStory Highlights Delegates to the 2015 Congress of Delegates addressed, among other topics, making medications affordable for patients and conducting research on the health effects of marijuana.\n\n\n\nAfter lengthy testimony and debate, delegates adopted a resolution that asked the Academy to advocate for graduated loan repayment programs.\n\n\n\nDelegates also adopted a measure that directed the Academy to support legislation eliminating nonmedical immunization exemptions for those participating in federally funded educational programs, including Head Start.\n\n\n\n\"So maybe the Academy should initiate a whistleblower suit against some of the generic drug price increases, and when it's settled, we get a cut,\" he quipped to a round of applause. General registrant Hugh Taylor, M.D., of South Hamilton, Mass., also spoke in support of the resolution, explaining that in his area of the state, physicians deal with a lot of Lyme disease. It used to be pretty cheap and easy to treat patients with medication, he noted, before the price of doxycycline went up significantly. \"So it's been a real problem for our patients,\" said Taylor.\n\n\n\nNoting that he is a member of the Academy's delegation to the AMA House of Delegates, Taylor said the AMA is actively researching what action it can take to help with this issue in accordance with a multipart resolution AMA delegates adopted during their 2015 annual meeting. That measure directed the AMA to, among other things, work with groups such as the Federal Trade Commission and the Generic Pharmaceutical Association to come up with solutions. Ultimately, AAFP delegates adopted a substitute resolution that called on the Academy to urge Congress and other appropriate federal agencies to investigate current policies that result in pharmaceutical price increases that create barriers to accessing generic medications. Marijuana Research\n\nThe reference committee also heard testimony on another drug-related pair of resolutions: one resolution introduced by the New York State AFP that sought to legalize marijuana \"for personal use\" and tax it to support substance abuse treatment, and a second resolution from the Minnesota AFP that called for the reclassification of marijuana to allow research to be conducted on its potential benefits for patients.\n\nGeneral registrant Heather Paladine, M.D., of New York, N.Y., supported both resolutions and contended that using the verbiage \"decriminalizing marijuana use\" versus \"legalizing\" its use would make it similar to alcohol -- that is, a substance adults could choose to use or not use. \"Having previously practiced in several states that have legalized medical marijuana, I chose as a physician to let people make their own choices about whether to use marijuana,\" she said. That approach avoids putting the physician in the awkward position of tacitly giving marijuana use a \"stamp of approval,\" Paladine added.\n\nGeneral registrant Heather Paladine, M.D., of New York, N.Y., testifies in support of a pair of resolutions discussing legalizing marijuana, explaining that decriminalizing marijuana use versus actually legalizing its use would make it similar to alcohol.", "article_metadata": {"category": "AAFP News", "description": "Delegates to the 2015 Congress of Delegates addressed affordable medication for patients and the need for more research on marijuana, among other topics, adopting a number of resolutions during the Sept. 29 business session.", "pubdate": "2015-10-02", "author": "Chris Crawford", "og": {"image": "http://www.aafp.org/content/dam/AAFP/images/logos_internal/og/AAFP-capital-RGB2_1024x512B.png", "description": "Delegates to the 2015 Congress of Delegates addressed affordable medication for patients and the need for more research on marijuana, among other topics, adopting a number of resolutions during the Sept. 29 business session.", "title": "Affordable Medications, Marijuana Research Among Topics Debated"}, "twitter": {"site": "@aafp", "image": "http://www.aafp.org/content/dam/AAFP/images/ann/2015-cod-fmx-images/nc-CoD_Advocacy_Glenn-Rodriguez.jpg", "description": "Delegates to the 2015 Congress of Delegates addressed affordable medication for patients and the need for more research on marijuana, among other topics, adopting a number of resolutions during the Sept. 29 business session.", "card": "summary", "title": "Affordable Medications, Marijuana Research Among Topics Debated"}, "lastreviewdate": "2015-10-02", "news-category": "News From 2015 COD and FMX", "nav-title": "Affordable Medications, Marijuana Research Among Topics Debated", "image": "http://www.aafp.org/content/dam/AAFP/images/ann/2015-cod-fmx-images/nc-CoD_Advocacy_Glenn-Rodriguez.jpg.daijpg.90.jpg", "keywords": "Congress of Delegates, COD, Advocacy, affordable medication, marijuana, inflated medication prices, reclassifying marijuana, naloxone, loan repayment, non-medical exemption, ACA", "content-type": "news-article", "archive": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "subcategory": "News From 2015 COD and FMX"}, "article_summary": "Story Highlights Delegates to the 2015 Congress of Delegates addressed, among other topics, making medications affordable for patients and conducting research on the health effects of marijuana.\nDelegates to the 2015 Congress of Delegates here addressed a number of health policy issues, including making medications affordable for patients and conducting more research on marijuana.\nAffordable MedicationDuring the Reference Committee on Advocacy hearing on Sept. 28, family physicians discussed a pair of closely related resolutions that addressed the availability of affordable pharmaceuticals.\nThat approach avoids putting the physician in the awkward position of tacitly giving marijuana use a \"stamp of approval,\" Paladine added.\nOregon delegate Glenn Rodriguez, M.D., of Milwaukie, testified in support of both resolutions, one of which the Oregon AFP had submitted."}
