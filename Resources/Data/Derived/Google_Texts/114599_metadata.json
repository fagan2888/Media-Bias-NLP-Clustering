He made fun of Jeff Gordon's age and Michael Waltrip's dancing outfits, too.\n\nBut it was an unlikely target \u2014 Joey Logano\u2019s pit crew \u2014 that probably got hit the worst. Mohr saved the best for last.\n\nBack to Danica. She wasn\u2019t at the banquet in the same room where a year ago she seemed to stare down Mohr who had made fun of her struggles as a rookie in 2013.\n\nIn an opening video skit that made fun of NASCAR\u2019s \u201cNation\u201d commercials, Mohr is told by his mother: \u201cYou be nice to Danica this year!\u201d\n\nMohr didn\u2019t listen.\n\n\u201cThis is my fifth time hosting the NASCAR awards, and I have learned, the drivers, you guys have proven to me that you can really take a joke,\u201d he told the crowd. \u201cWell, you guys.\u201d\n\nWhile Patrick wasn\u2019t there for fans to see her reaction, Keselowski obviously was. He laughed at the jokes that he later said helps bring drivers back to a little bit to the outside world.\n\n\u201cIn Kentucky, Brad Keselowski cut his hand in victory lane opening a bottle of champagne,\u201d Mohr needled. \u201cEven booze hates Brad Keselowski.\n\n\u201cWhere is Brad? Let me look for the table of one.\u201d\n\nMohr also made fun of other victory lane moments, as he repeatedly joked about NASCAR now giving \u201cwinner\u201d stickers to drivers after a win.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the same reward for winning a race that my 2-and-a-half year-old son gets for making a potty,\u201d he said. \u201cA sticker? \u2026 What idea did they turn down?\n\n\u201cStuffed animals? Free hugs? A goldfish in a plastic bag?\u201d\n\nHe also talked about the sticker when trying to figure out how Denny Hamlin\u2019s diagnosis at California in March (which was done at the track infield medical center) went from a sinus infection to later being diagnosed with a piece of metal in his eye. He suggested Hamlin just put stickers over his eye.\n\n\u201cHow do you misdiagnose metal in your eye with a sinus infection?\u201d he said. \u201cWho\u2019s your doctor? Dre? Seuss? Phil?\n\n\u201cIs that Obamacare?\u201d\n\nIf that stung, no one was stinging more than Logano\u2019s pit crew, who had a rough championship race, dropping a lugnut on one pit stop and then having the car fall off the jack on the pivotal late-race stop.\n\n\u201cI hope I\u2019m not talking too fast,\u201d Mohr said. \u201cI don\u2019t want Joey Logano\u2019s pit crew to miss any of my jokes. \u2026 I\u2019m not saying that Joey Logano\u2019s pit crew is slow, but tomorrow they\u2019re celebrating Thanksgiving.\u201d\n\nIn addressing 2014 Cup champion Kevin Harvick as well as Harvick's 2-year-old son Keelan, Mohr found away to rip on Logano's crew again:\n\n\u201cYou earned it,\" he told Harvick, who made his Cup debut in 2001. \"It took you 14 years to get here. Fourteen years. That\u2019s like six Joey Logano pit stops. \u2026 Joey Logano's pit crew is so slow, Keelan just turned 9.\"\n\nOf course, Harvick himself also got a little ribbing. And it tied into Mohr\u2019s jokes about the NASCAR fights.\n\n\u201cI have to admit I\u2019m a little uncomfortable up here with Kevin Harvick behind me,\u201d Mohr said. \u201cCan somebody please let me know if he tries to push me into the audience.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Sporting News", "description": "Mohr couldn\u2019t avoid talking about the fights and current most-hated driver Brad Keselowski.
