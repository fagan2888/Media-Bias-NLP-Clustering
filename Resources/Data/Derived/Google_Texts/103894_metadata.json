Wolke and colleagues found that children born significantly ahead of term, or before the 32nd week of pregnancy, had a 39.4 percent chance of having general mathematical impairment. That\u2019s more than twice the risk of children carried to term, for whom the figure was 14.9 percent.\n\n\"In general, preterm and small-for-gestational-age children often have mathematic problems,\u201d Dr. Julia Jaekel, study co-author from the Ruhr-University Bochum, said in a press release. \u201cAnd, even if they are not diagnosed with dyscalculia, they may need special help in school to not be left behind academically.\u201d\n\nDyscalculia and Beyond\n\nToday, about 2.4 million U.S. students are diagnosed with some type of learning disability. Although improved resources have helped bring down the number of diagnoses, conditions like dyslexia and dyscalculia still pose a significant burden on students, with one in five sufferers dropping out of high school. Similarly, only 10 percent of people with learning disabilities enroll in a four-year college within two years of graduation compared to 28 percent of the general public.\n\nWhile it is not clear why some premature babies develop these problems, knowledge of the elevated risk may help create a better learning environment in schools. \"Teachers should be aware of these children's problems and need to work on ways of math instruction that help preterm children deal with the high cognitive workload and integration of information required for mathematic tasks in school,\u201d Wolke told reporters.\n\nSource: Jaekel J, Wolke D.
