The daddys are gone. At Florida State we were talking like 65 percent. It might be more or less at other schools. FCA tries to help fill that gap to get coaches and players to be role models.\u201d\n\nBowden, a native of Birmingham, won 315 games at Florida State, another 42 in six years at West Virginia before that.\n\nHis 1993 and 1999 FSU teams won national championships. He coached 24 consensus All-Americans, and not all came from homes with All-American families.\n\nThose who experienced little discipline and structure previously did not always easily adapt to a new environment, and off-field issues could follow.\n\nSome players Bowden couldn\u2019t help, because they were immediately suspended, he said.\n\n\u201cI would give them a second chance if I could,\u201d Bowden said. \u201cThey used to call me the second-chance coach, and sometimes the press didn\u2019t like that, but that\u2019s what Christianity is all about. \u201cSo many of these kids did not have a father in the home.\u201d\n\nPlayers like this were seeking leadership, and FCA was not a hard sell for them, Bowden said.\n\nHe wants coaches to understand the importance of modeling positive behavior.\n\n\u201cI would tell them that God has put them where they are for a reason,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they live a Christian life and encourage boys to get into FCA where they learn how to pray and read the Bible \u2026 I\u2019ve seen many saved that way.\u201d\n\nFor more information on he Breakfast of Champions, call 315-0860 or visit MississippiFCA.org.\n\nparrish.alford@journalinc.com\n\nTwitter: @parrishalford", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal", "description": "By Parrish Alford Daily Journal Robert Cleckler Bowden, better known as Bobby, says he embraced a reputation as the coach of second chances during his 34-year run at Florida State.
