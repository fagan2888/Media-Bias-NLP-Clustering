Hernando County officials have received Giarratana\u2019s plans for a new restaurant on the same site, and he plans to meet with building staffers and inspectors at a code compliance review meeting Thursday to address a few technical matters.\n\nThe eatery at 6244 Spring Lake Highway, between Brooksville and Ridge Manor, opened 33 years ago. Many considered it a local landmark. The pre-dawn fire that destroyed the building in January was sparked by an electrical malfunction in the dining room\u2019s ceiling, the state fire marshal determined.\n\nFrom the outside, the new Papa Joe\u2019s will resemble the former restaurant. Giarratana plans to expand the sidewalk about two feet, but the building will look similar, right down to familiar columns.\n\nInside, patrons immediately will notice differences, he said.\n\nInstead of a deli section, there will be a larger and more visible full liquor bar, possibly with a fountain.\n\nMost diners will be seated in a small dining room, equipped to handle about 60 people. There also will be a private dining room with 80 to 90 seats for banquets and larger events.\n\n\u201cBefore, we were sitting about 100 people in the big dining room and 40 in the banquet room,\u201d Giarratana said.\n\nThe menu will be much the same, except for expanded seafood and steak selections.\n\n\u201cAll the Italian staples will be there, but we\u2019ll be changing the menu a little bit,\u201d he said.\n\nBob Showalter, owner of Brooksville-based Showalter Builders, said he felt bad for the Giarratanas and, as a contractor, plans to be personally involved with the rebuilding.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re hoping to be in construction by the end of September and we\u2019re hoping to be completed sometime in February,\u201d Showalter said. \u201cThat\u2019s the game plan right now.\u201d\n\nShowalter said he realizes the significance of Papa Joe\u2019s and how important it was to the community. That is one reason he pursued the project.\n\n\u201cI was looking forward to doing it and really went after the job,\u201d he said.\n\nGiarratana said Nicholson Engineering Associates is the engineer for the new building.\n\nJoe and Donna Giarratana frequently held charitable events at the restaurant, including an annual 99-cent spaghetti dinner the first Tuesday in October, with proceeds donated to charities.\n\nGiarratana said that won\u2019t change when the restaurant reopens. In fact, he\u2019s not even waiting that long.\n\nOn Oct. 7, he once again will give out meals \u2014 albeit cooked off-site \u2014 for people to take with them. A percentage of the proceeds will go toward churches that assisted in the restaurant\u2019s relief fund.\n\nAfter the fire, Giarratana lost about 45 employees. Shortly before he re-opens, he plans to advertise for another 45 or so staffers. Former employees are welcome to apply, he said.\n\nGiarratana said he has vivid memories of rushing to his restaurant in the early hours of that winter morning and seeing the business in flames: \u201cYou never forget,\u201d he said.\n\nNow, with its rebirth likely a few months away, Giarratana said it\u2019s almost too much to take in.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been overwhelming,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like reading your eulogy. You\u2019ve been dead and you come back to life.\u201d\n\nmbates@hernandotoday.com\n\n(352) 544-5290", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sun, 07 Sep 2014 23:34:39 -0400", "Description": "BROOKSVILLE \u2014 Eight months after fire destroyed Papa Joe\u2019s Italian Restaurant, owner Joe Giarratana said people still ask if he plans to re-open the popular eatery.", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "BROOKSVILLE \u2014 Eight months after fire destroyed Papa Joe\u2019s Italian Restaurant, owner Joe Giarratana said people still ask if he plans to re-open the popular eatery.", "title": "Papa Joe\u2019s restaurant destroyed by fire is being rebuilt", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/Local/CommunityNews/papa-joes-restaurant-destroyed-by-fire-is-being-rebuilt-20140907/", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140907/ARTICLE/140909345/EP/1/2/EP-140909345.jpg", "height": 1243}, "updated_time": "2014-09-08T11:24:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "BROOKSVILLE \u2014 Eight months after fire destroyed Papa Joe\u2019s Italian Restaurant, owner Joe Giarratana said people still ask if he plans to re-open the popular eatery.", "title": "Papa Joe\u2019s restaurant destroyed by fire is being rebuilt", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140907/ARTICLE/140909345/AR/0/AR-140909345.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2014-09-07T23:34:39Z-04", "modified_time": "2014-09-08T11:24:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "papa joe's brooksville,papa joes brooksville,restaurant"}, "article_summary": "Eight months after fire destroyed Papa Joe\u2019s Italian Restaurant, owner Joe Giarratana said people still ask if he plans to re-open the popular eatery.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the game plan right now.\u201dShowalter said he realizes the significance of Papa Joe\u2019s and how important it was to the community.\nFrom the outside, the new Papa Joe\u2019s will resemble the former restaurant.\n\u201cBefore, we were sitting about 100 people in the big dining room and 40 in the banquet room,\u201d Giarratana said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just been unreal support.\u201dBarring unforeseen delays, Papa Joe\u2019s will serve up its trademark pasta and spaghetti sauce in about five months."}
