In 2008, nearly 4,000 people lined up for a dinner. Today, it's less than half that.\n\nBut that's a good thing, right?\n\n\"It's not a bad thing because it means they're getting food somewhere and they'll be able to spend Christmas with someone and have a meal,\" says Shawna Kroh, a spokesperson for the Salvation Army. \"We're hoping that's the case.\"\n\nAnd that does appear to be the case.\n\nMore and more Tucsonans are going a step beyond volunteering to serve meals, to actually doing the serving themselves.\n\nJust a quick look around town during Christmas, 2014.\n\nSeveral hundred are being fed in Santa Rita Park on 22nd by a group which has been feeding the needy for the past 17 years.\n\nA pizza cafe on Broadway is giving free pizza to the homeless or homeless who donate to the homeless.\n\nA half dozen food trucks lined up late in the day in Santa Rita Park with 26 turkey's and all the trimmings.\n\n\"There are a lot more services out there serving food on Christmas day,\" says Kroh.\n\nRoy Aros and a couple of friends thought they'd help out in 1997 so they grabbed a couple of grills out of the back yard, bought 50 hamburgers and 100 hot dogs and set up on a cold, wet Christmas and fed a few dozen hungry people.\n\nFast forward by 17 years and the menu has changed a bit.\n\n\"We're probably looking at a thousand pounds of chicken, 18 turkeys, 1,000 hamburgers and a half dozen hams on the rotisserie,\" says Aros.\n\nAnd the line is 350 long.\n\nNot just food now but sleeping bags, warm blankets, sweatshirts and more.\n\nDog food for the dogs. Toys for the kids.\n\nAnd from Aros. \"It's the least we can do,\" he says.\n\nLater in the day, the food trucks pull in and announce they will feed all comers.\n\nSusan French, one of the organizers, says last year they pulled in with 30 meals and they were gone in eight minutes.\n\nThis year they decided to do more.\n\nDown the street and just north, the Broadway Pizza cafe is cooking up pizza's for the neighborhood.\n\nJay Jofee tells his customers he'll work on Christmas day if they'll bring in some canned food in exchange for free pizza.\n\nAnd the homeless, the needy or families who can't eat pizza on the their budget, are encouraged to come in to eat a large pizza pie.\n\nWe talked to a family which didn't want to be embarrassed told us their kids don't get pizza because they can't afford it.\n\nJay gave them a real Christmas treat.\n\nLat year, he gave the food bank 2,500 cans.\n\nIt's this kind of generosity which is spreading, making it a bit easier for those who need to have a full belly on Christmas.\n\nBut just because the Salvation Army isn't feeding as many as in the past, it doesn't mean the need is any less.\n\n\"Those people will always be with us, those people will always be poor,\" says Major Clement Leslie, of the Salvation Army. \"The poor will always be with us.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright 2014 Tucson News Now.
