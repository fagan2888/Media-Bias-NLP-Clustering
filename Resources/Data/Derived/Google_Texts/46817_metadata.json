Or so says the Heritage Foundation, which on Tuesday will start doing just that.\n\nCall it think-tank journalism, or maybe just journalism. Heritage is calling it the Daily Signal, the Washington policy organization\u2019s online helping of the day\u2019s news, reported and edited straight up, the site\u2019s architects promise.\n\n\u201cOur sense is there are a lot of really good stories that go unreported or under-reported,\u201d says Geoff Lysaught, the site\u2019s publisher and Heritage\u2019s vice president of strategic communications. \u201cOur whole role here is to make sure that the facts find their way into the light.\u201d\n\nHence, Tuesday\u2019s debut edition, which features an exclusive story by former CBS News correspondent Sharyl Attkisson about government-funded medical research on premature babies. The article contends that researchers may have violated federal requirements on informed consent. (Attkisson\u2019s work on medical topics has been controversial; medical experts criticized her reporting in 2012 about a purported link between vaccines and autism.) The site also has an interview with Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback (R) about the federal health-care law\u2019s impact on his state,and a first-person account by Heritage president Jim DeMint about his recent trip to Korea\u2019s demilitarized zone.\n\nPlus, video featurettes and a daily infographic \u2014 just like many other news sites.\n\nWhich is kind of the point. The journalism has to be \u201cfair, factual [and] trustworthy,\u201d as editor Rob Bluey puts it, to have credibility not just with Heritage\u2019s 600,000 donors and members, but with the wider audience that DeMint, a Republican former senator from South Carolina, hopes to reach. The Signal\u2019s news reporting, in effect, will act as a sweetener to bring conservatives, moderates and even liberals to the Heritage-friendly commentary that will be part of the site.\n\nBluey and other members of the Signal\u2019s news team acknowledge that there are plenty of places to get a conservative take on the news (a partial list: The Blaze, the Daily Caller, the Washington Times, the Washington Examiner, Breitbart.com, the Washington Free Beacon, the Drudge Report, Newsmax, the Weekly Standard, National Review, and a certain TV network that promises to be fair and balanced).\n\nThe Signal will have a small staff \u2014 12 journalists to start \u2014 and a relatively small budget of $1 million a year. The site does not accept advertising, yet Lysaught figures the site can find its niche. \u201cWe want to be where the news gets its news,\u201d he says. \u201cWe want to see a world where Fox, MSNBC, CNN, The Washington Post and the New York Times are reporting on the things that were first reported on the Daily Signal.\u201d\n\nThe Signal\u2019s precursor \u2014 a Heritage blog called the Foundry \u2014 has had a couple of greatest hits. In November, Bluey and reporter Kelsey Harris were tipped by a North Carolina man, Justin Hadley, about a privacy breach that occurred when he tried to use the HealthCare.gov Web site. The story resonated among conservatives and was picked up by more than a dozen news outlets, including the Drudge Report and Fox News\u2019s \u201cSpecial Report.\u201d\n\nIn February, news editor Ken McIntyre began relentlessly covering President Obama\u2019s pick to head the Justice Department\u2019s civil-rights division, Debo Adegbile. McIntyre\u2019s stories emphasized Adegbile\u2019s work defending convicted cop-killer Mumia Abu-Jamal, stirring strong Republican opposition. The Senate eventually blocked Adegbile\u2019s nomination.\n\nThe Foundry will disappear with the advent of the Daily Signal, but its following \u2014 some 2.6 million unique visitors last month \u2014 are likely to gravitate to its replacement.\n\nAlthough DeMint has pledged to stay out of editorial decisions, the Signal\u2019s challenge will be to separate itself from its benefactor\u2019s stated mission, which is to promote conservative public policies.\n\nMost of the staff is drawn from news organizations with conservative leanings. McIntyre worked for two decades at the Washington Times; Bluey hails from Human Events (which describes itself as \u201cthe nation\u2019s leading conservative voice\u201d) and CNS News, an offshoot of Brent Bozell\u2019s Media Research Center. Managing editor Katrina Trinko joined in January from the National Review, the magazine founded by William F. Buckley. Other staff members come from Fox News and the Washington Examiner.\n\nSo far, the Signal\u2019s news agenda doesn\u2019t stray very far from Heritage\u2019s policy agenda. The core of the Signal\u2019s editorial staff, meeting Monday in the organization\u2019s headquarters near Capitol Hill, showed a visitor an early version of the site. A news bar at the top displayed four \u201cthemes\u201d that the staff expects to cover in depth: the Common Core educational standards, Obamacare, Benghazi and cronyism.\n\nThe four topics have been meat and potatoes for Heritage\u2019s analysts. Cronyism refers to cronyism at the Export-Import Bank, which provides government-backed loans to foreign firms to enable them to buy American exports. The bank was the subject of a blistering Heritage report on Friday.\n\nStill, Bluey hopes to reach beyond the people who already support Heritage.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re probably not going to break through to the liberal left,\u201d he says. \u201cWe do think that by doing the news, and having that wall between news and opinion, there is an opportunity to reach beyond\u201d the foundation\u2019s core audience.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It\u2019s not enough to be a newsmaker these days, as the conservative Heritage Foundation surely has been with its vigorous opposition to federal budget deficits, Obamacare, immigrant \u201camnesty\u201d and same-s...", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/paul.farhi", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "It\u2019s not enough to be a newsmaker these days, as the conservative Heritage Foundation surely has been with its vigorous opposition to federal budget deficits, Obamacare, immigrant \u201camnesty\u201d and same-s...", "title": "Heritage Foundation starts online site to cover news it says is unreported or under-reported", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/heritage-foundation-starts-online-site-to-cover-news-it-says-is-unreported-or-under-reported/2014/06/02/2a7631ce-ea76-11e3-b98c-72cef4a00499_story.html", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=https://img.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-3000x1568.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@farhip"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/heritage-foundation-starts-online-site-to-cover-news-it-says-is-unreported-or-under-reported/2014/06/02/2a7631ce-ea76-11e3-b98c-72cef4a00499_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Heritage Foundation, Jim DeMint, Rob Bluey, Ken McIntyre, Geoff Lysaught, Brent Bozell, William F.
