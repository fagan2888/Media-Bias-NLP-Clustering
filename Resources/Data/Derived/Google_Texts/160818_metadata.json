After the California State appropriations committee voted 5-2 on Friday to require warning health labels on bottled and canned sugary drinks, many experts weighed in, including those abroad. Simon Capewell a professor of public health at the University of Liverpool, highlights that the new health warning move by California is a good idea and one that the UK public would support.\n\nCapewell believes that the public would receive the labeling well, especially considering many other harmful products already carry warning, such as insecticides and cigarettes. The warnings\u2019 power to deter users from harmful products and ingredients is \"now agreed by almost everyone\" according to Capewell.\n\nIn an effort to deter the consumption of high-calorie beverages, which medical experts believes is a large contributor to the childhood obesity epidemic, the bill may be meet fierce opposition when it hits the senate floor for a final vote as early as Wednesday.\n\n\"This is a major victory for public health advocates, community groups, physicians, and dentists,\u201d Bill Monning, Democratic state senator and author of the bill, told Reuters. \"By informing consumer choice, we can improve the health of Californians.\u201d\n\nLast year, Monning also supposed a proposed measure that would have placed taxes on sugary drinks; however, it fell unsuccessful with no surprise, considering New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg\u2019s failed attempt in 2012.\n\nCapewell\u2019s international opinion on America\u2019s attempt to curb the liquid sugar consumption is one of hope. He says sugar is \"increasingly being implicated as a specific causal factor\" for overweight, obesity, and higher risks of heart disease. The \"current UK and U.S. obesity policies are failing to reverse obesity trends,\" he added.\n\nA recent BBC survey found that 60 percent of adults would support health warnings similar to those on cigarette packets on food packaging. Even more, 70 percent would support \"banning sugary drinks in UK schools, or limiting the amount of sugar allowed in certain foods.\u201d\n\nThe warning labels represent an \"interesting natural experiment\" that \"may offer an effective new strategy to complement existing, potentially powerful interventions like marketing bans and sugary drinks duties,\" Capewell said.\n\n\"Proposals may herald a tipping point in public attitudes and political feasibilities\" and that \"investors, industrialists, and international health groups will all be watching closely,\" Capewell continued.\n\nThe leading opposition said although the proposal has good intentions, ultimately it \"will do nothing to prevent obesity, diabetes, or tooth decay, and may even make problems worse,\" according to Lisa Katic, who testified on behalf of the California Nevada Soft Drink Association in April because the sugar in Americans\u2019 diets comes mainly from sandwiches and hamburgers and not the frequently scapegoated sodas and other soft drinks.\n\nThe American Heart Association recommends Americans drastically cut back on their added sugar intake in order to slow down on the ubiquitous obesity and heart disease epidemics. Harvard School of Public Health agrees and adds that soft drinks are the primary source of extra calories, weight gain, and provide no nutritional benefits, along with many popular children\u2019s breakfast cereals.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "sugary, drink, warning, labels, expert, agrees, new, california, bill, health, warnings, soda", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Health expert weighs in on the benefits that could rise from the California mandate to place warning labels on sugary drinks such as soda.", "title": "Should Sugary Drinks Have Health Warning Labels?
