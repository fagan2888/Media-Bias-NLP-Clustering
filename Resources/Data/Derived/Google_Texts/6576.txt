This year has been a challenging time for covering the state of New Jersey. From the gubernatorial election to the Hurricane Sandy recovery to the numerous sporting events in the region, New Jersey has it all.

Along with other photojournalists, I feel very fortunate to cover a wide array of assignments. I covered Gov. Chris Christie as he ran for and won his second term as governor. I was among a group of Star-Ledger journalists covering the Major League Baseball All-Star game as well as the last game of Yankees great Mariano Rivera.

The highlight of my year was being assigned to cover the pursuit of Rutgers Scarlet Knights women's basketball head coach C. Vivian Stringer as she went after her 900th career win. I traveled to Queens, N.Y., to cover her as she attempted to win against St. John's, only to fall short.

Her next game was against South Florida at home in Piscataway, where she came away with the win and the crowd was celebrating as if the team had won the NCAA national title. The event was one of the pure moments when sports is special in everyone's heart.

This was not the only sporting event I saw as a true special moment. The retirement of Yankees relief pitcher Rivera was an event that lasted all season long. As the final week approached and the Yankees were eliminated from playoff contention, all the attention turned to #42.

This was underscored when his two longtime teammates, Derek Jeter and Andy Pettitte, went to the mound to get him in the 9th inning. What an emotional moment, and one of the best ways to say, "Exit Sandman."
