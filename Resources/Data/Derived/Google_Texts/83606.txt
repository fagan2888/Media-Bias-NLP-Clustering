Dozens gathered at Frank Brown Park Saturday for the 9th Annual "Furry Friend 5K Race." Those who participated either walked with their own pet or walked a furry pup that is looking for a "fur-ever" home.

The cost of registration was $25 per person. Humane Society employees said each year they raise thousands of dollars which goes to the local shelter.

Kyla Thrall, the General Manager of the Bay County Humane Society said, "Everybody loves it, there's not a lot of 5K's that you can bring your animals to, so it's just a totally different feel it's not the racing for the time kind of feel, it's just coming out and having a good time and enjoying that time with family and pets and friends."

Humane society employees said over the last nine years of hosting the event, Saturday's 5K had the largest turn out.
