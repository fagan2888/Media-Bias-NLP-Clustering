I did not see a whole lot of candidates that were likely to energize and mobilize and bring together those millions of conservatives who had been staying home,\" said Ted Cruz.\n\nCruz also spoke with the media before the event, and had plenty of nice things to say about current Republican front-runner Donald Trump.\n\n\"I am glad that he is running, I think that his campaign has been enormously beneficial for my campaign. The biggest reason is his campaign has framed the central question of this election as who will stand up to Washington,\" said Cruz.\n\nCruz says that while he's glad Trump is running, he feels he is a better choice than the billionaire to be the GOP's nominee.\n\nCruz says if he's elected, on his first day he'll rescind all of President Obama's executive orders, order a federal investigation of Planned Parenthood, end religious liberty persecution, and cancel the Iranian Nuclear Deal.", "article_metadata": {"description": "(SIOUX CITY, IA) Another Presidential candidate visits Sioux City, Texas Senator Ted Cruz appeared with Iowa Congressman Steve King and Senator Chuck Grassley earlier Monday night at Western Iowa Tech.", "title": "Ted Cruz Makes a Stop in Sioux City", "og": {"site_name": "KMEG", "description": "(SIOUX CITY, IA) Another Presidential candidate visits Sioux City, Texas Senator Ted Cruz appeared with Iowa Congressman Steve King and Senator Chuck Grassley earlier Monday night at Western Iowa Tech.", "title": "Ted Cruz Makes a Stop in Sioux City", "url": "http://siouxlandnews.com/news/local/ted-cruz-makes-a-stop-in-sioux-city", "image": "http://static-12.sinclairstoryline.com/resources/media/66b2f1b8-845a-48c6-8645-03f00f93ceef-9002311_G.jpg?1444736179688", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://static-11.sinclairstoryline.com/resources/media/66b2f1b8-845a-48c6-8645-03f00f93ceef-9002311_G.jpg?1444736179688", "description": "(SIOUX CITY, IA) Another Presidential candidate visits Sioux City, Texas Senator Ted Cruz appeared with Iowa Congressman Steve King and Senator Chuck Grassley earlier Monday night at Western Iowa Tech.", "site": "@siouxlandnews", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Ted Cruz Makes a Stop in Sioux City"}, "author": "Sinclair Broadcast Group", "blitz": "mu-cc36119f-f4dca522-3261b206-4b3bbd3f", "robots": "index, follow", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 1905919346300867}, "keywords": "local,IA", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/siouxlandnews", "published_time": "2015-10-12T22:29:41+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=0.5"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2426\"", "article_summary": "Texas Senator Ted Cruz appeared with Iowa Congressman Steve King and Senator Chuck Grassley earlier Monday night at Western Iowa Tech.\nThe event at Western Iowa Tech was an opportunity for Cruz to preach his message, of limited government in a fairly conservative part of the state.\nCruz says that while he's glad Trump is running, he feels he is a better choice than the billionaire to be the GOP's nominee.\nCruz also spoke with the media before the event, and had plenty of nice things to say about current Republican front-runner Donald Trump.\n\"I am glad that he is running, I think that his campaign has been enormously beneficial for my campaign."}
