The hearing will be held by the House Oversight Committee and Gruber will have to field questions from Chairman Darrell Issa and angry lawmakers about the legislation.\n\nGruber became infamous just a few weeks ago after a Philadelphia financial consultant and citizen blogger started pulling and publishing multiple video clips of him at various events discussing Obamacare. During those events, Gruber admitted the redistribution of wealth in the legislation was purposely covered up along with the fact that Obamacare is indeed a tax.\n\nMeanwhile, the White House has distanced itself from Gruber in the wake of his controversial comments and Health and Human Services sent a letter to Issa last week asking that officials from the Department, who will also testify tomorrow, be seated separately from Gruber. More from The Hill:\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is asking lawmakers not to seat ObamaCare consultant Jonathan Gruber next to Medicare's top official when the two testify on Capitol Hill next week.\n\n\n\nHHS Assistant Secretary for Legislation Jim Esquea wrote to the House Oversight Committee with the request, stating that government witnesses are \"almost always afforded an opportunity\" to sit alone or with other federal officials.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe accommodation of separate panels for government witnesses reflects important comity in congressional-executive relations,\u201d Esquea wrote. \u201cThe relatively few exceptions to this practice reinforce the seriousness of this accommodation.\u201d\n\n\n\n\"The request is currently before Chairman Issa but at past hearings, government officials have testified alongside other non-administration witnesses,\" said Becca Watkins, a spokeswoman for the committee.\n\nThe hearing starts tomorrow at 9:30 am et.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Questions. .05/25/2016 20:26:00PM EST.", "author": "Katie Pavlich", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Questions.", "title": "- Obamacare Architect Jonathan Gruber to Testify on Capitol Hill This Week About \"Stupidity of American Voters\"", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2014/12/08/obamacare-architect-jonathan-gruber-to-testify-on-capitol-hill-this-week-n1928889", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2012/92/e54b5922-b7c4-478d-94d8-17b8cde9fb80@news.ap.org.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Questions.", "title": "- Obamacare Architect Jonathan Gruber to Testify on Capitol Hill This Week About \"Stupidity of American Voters\"", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2014/12/08/obamacare-architect-jonathan-gruber-to-testify-on-capitol-hill-this-week-n1928889", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2012/92/e54b5922-b7c4-478d-94d8-17b8cde9fb80@news.ap.org.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Obamacare Architect Jonathan Gruber to Testify on Capitol Hill This Week About \"Stupidity of American Voters\" , Katie Pavlich, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf498\"", "article_summary": "MIT professor and Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber will testify on Capitol Hill Tuesday about his role in selling the 2010 healthcare law to \"stupid American voters\" through deception and non-transparency.\nMore from The Hill:The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is asking lawmakers not to seat ObamaCare consultant Jonathan Gruber next to Medicare's top official when the two testify on Capitol Hill next week.\nThe hearing will be held by the House Oversight Committee and Gruber will have to field questions from Chairman Darrell Issa and angry lawmakers about the legislation.\nDuring those events, Gruber admitted the redistribution of wealth in the legislation was purposely covered up along with the fact that Obamacare is indeed a tax.\nGruber became infamous just a few weeks ago after a Philadelphia financial consultant and citizen blogger started pulling and publishing multiple video clips of him at various events discussing Obamacare."}
