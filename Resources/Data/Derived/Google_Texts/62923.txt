On May 5, the Legislature's outside attorneys filed the appeal in Supreme Court, naming the Legislative Council as the plaintiff. However, the council never voted to continue the case, and under an opinion by the Legislature's lawyer, it had no authority to take a vote even if it wanted to. The legal opinion said the Legislative Council's authority to sue expired when the full Legislature went into session, and the Senate and House would have to vote on continuing the case.
