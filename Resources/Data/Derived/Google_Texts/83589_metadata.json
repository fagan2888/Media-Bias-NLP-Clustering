Mr. Broussard filed suit earlier this year against First Tower Loan LLC. I\u2019m happy to report that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission \u2013 EEOC joined Tristan Broussard\u2019s trans discrimination suit.\n\nDespite the fact that Mr. Broussard out-performed his boss\u2019 expectations given the short time he was on the job, he was told he needed to dress and act like a woman. Mr. Broussard hadn\u2019t yet had his driver\u2019s license updated to reflect his change of gender. Rather than discuss the issue or wait for a driver\u2019s license change to be completed, the company gave Mr. Broussard a choice:\n\nPresent as a female, in dress and behavior, or you\u2019re fired.\n\nFirst Tower, a loan company headquartered in Flowood, Mississippi, has locations in Mississippi, Alabama, Missouri, Illinois and Louisiana. Mr. Broussard was employed at the Lake Charles, Louisiana branch until March 2013.\n\nThe EEOC advised First Tower of the wrongful discharge as part of Mr. Broussard\u2019s original complaint. However, the advice fell on deaf, transphobic ears. This prompted Mr. Broussard to file suit. He is seeking undisclosed damages from First Tower, whose attorney refused comment.\n\nOne believes that First Tower will soon learn the error of its ways. The EEOC has leant its considerable authority to Mr. Broussard\u2019s cause by joining his suit in federal court. It is the EEOC\u2019s opinion that First Tower sexually discriminated against Mr. Broussard on the issue of gender, something expressly forbidden by Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. U.S. courts and the EEOC have both previously held that employers can neither fire nor refuse to hire based on the employee being transgender.\n\nAs before, I wish this brave young man all the best in his pursuit of justice. I sincerely hope that the addition of the EEOC in the suit will be of great help to him. Look for more on this story as it becomes available.\n\nSource:\n\nJoin the Discussion", "article_metadata": {"description": "Mr. Broussard filed suit earlier this year against First Tower Loan.
