As written, would the legislation known as a \"religious liberty\" bill offer any specific protection that is not already protected by the law of the land?\n\nThe answer falls outside a Truth-O-Meter ruling, since we cannot fact check a judicial interpretation.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean there are not judicial facts surrounding SB 129, which would require government to show a compelling interest for public policy to override an individual\u2019s religious freedom.\n\nThat concept is called the Sherbert Test in legal circles.\n\nFor about two decades, it set the standard that governments must show they pursued action that was the least restrictive or burdensome to religion.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court limited that test in 1990, ruling in Oregon vs. Smith that individuals can\u2019t claim religious exemptions from generally applicable laws that are not targeted directly at religion, said Eric Segall, the Kathy and Lawrence Ashe Professor of Law at Georgia State University and a Constitutional scholar.\n\nReaction to that ruling gave way to the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, in which Congress reinstated the Sherbert test.\n\n\"The federal Constitution does not allow people to escape their secular, general obligations on the basis of religious objections,\" Segal said. \"If the rule were otherwise, the Constitution would enshrine religious supremacy not religious equality or liberty.\"\n\nThat\u2019s something Ralston likely knows, since he is a practicing attorney.\n\nBut the federal religious liberty law is of little help, too. It applies only to federal actions, according to the Supreme Court\u2019s 2014 ruling that allowed Hobby Lobby to opt out of some Obamacare mandates based on religious beliefs.\n\nStatewide bills would extend those protections to state actions. Advocates of SB 129 have said that is there intent with the Georgia proposal.\n\nOpponents warn the proposal is an end run on the First Amendment that could allow business owners to cite beliefs to deny people service.\n\nCorporate players, in particular, helped kill similar bills last year, out of concern they would allow discrimination against gays and lesbians.\n\nThat is one of the issues still under intense debate under the Gold Dome.\n\nOften missing from that back-and-forth: Georgia does not have any specific statewide protections for gays and lesbians.\n\nWithout that, SB 129 could in theory tilt the law in Georgia to allow religious exemptions to trump claims of discrimination, said Mark Goldfeder, an Emory Law School professor and senior fellow at the school\u2019s Center for the Study of Law and Religion.\n\nGoldfeder said Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes\u2019 Bad Man theory \u2013 in which bad actors care only for the material consequences of law and do not follow their conscience \u2013 would suggest that priority could create problems.\n\n\"Georgia has not really had religion under attack,\" Goldfeder said. \"The concern is that because of the gray area in Georgia's (anti-discrimination) law, a bill like this might allow people who were so inclined to discriminate, and simply assert that it is based on a religious belief.\"\n\nThat focus of the debate is likely to continue at least until April 2, when the legislative session is slated to end.\n\nPolitiFact Georgia will keep watching, to see if either side makes claims based more on checkable facts instead of intent.\n\nRalston\u2019s interview suggests those may be coming.\n\n\"I have said all along that I\u2019m wrestling with the issue,\" he said in the GPB interview. \"I think it\u2019s an honest and civil disagreement over an intense and emotional issue.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "A bill that supporters say would prevent Georgia&rsquo;s governments from intruding on faith-based beliefs has cleared one chamber of the General Assembly.
