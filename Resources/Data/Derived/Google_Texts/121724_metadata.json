For years now they have been reporting the evidence of increasingly cold weather worldwide.\n\nOn the same day the President was lying about warming, eight inches of snow fell in Rize, Turkey. It has fallen as well in South Africa, Norway, Sweden, Finland and Russia while closer to home snow fell on several cities in Idaho with cold freezes extending into Oregon. In June!\n\nObama used the speech to demand that politicians take steps to acknowledge climate change which used to be called global warming until it became undeniable to everyone except the charlatans lining their pockets with utterly bogus \u201cresearch\u201d that underwrites the source of the lies, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).\n\nObama continues to listen to his White House advisor, Dr. John Holdren, whose contempt for the human race is such he would happily see large parts of it disappear. In February, Holdren told reporters that all weather is impacted by climate change, but that is what climate change has done for 4.5 billion years. Not mentioned was that climate cycles are measured in centuries while weather is a short-term event. The most recent mini-ice age lasted from 1300 to 1850.\n\nHoldren alluded to droughts affecting parts of the nation, claiming they were getting longer and drying. Two leading climate scientists, former NASA scientist Dr. Roy Spencer and University of Colorado climate scientists, Roger Pielke, Jr, called Holdren\u2019s assertions \u201cpseudo-science rambling.\u201d \u201cThe idea that any of the weather we are seeing is in any significant way due to humanity\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions verges on irrationality,\u201d said Spencer. Pielke called Holdren\u2019s assertions \u201czombie science.\u201d\n\nWhile Holdren is warning about droughts that could cause famines, James M. Taylor, the managing editor of the Heartland Institute\u2019s monthly, Environment & Climate News, took aim at the IPCC claims, noting that U.S. and global crop production, especially the most important staple food crops, corn, rice, and wheat, \u201chave more than tripled since 1970. During the past few years, the United States has set crop production records for alfalfa, cotton, beans, sugar beets, sweet potatoes, canola, corn, flaxseed, hops, rice sorghum, soybeans, sunflowers, peanuts and wheat, to name just a few.\u201d\n\nThe worst part of Obama\u2019s lies about the so-called \u201cgreenhouse gases\u201d that we\u2019ve been told for decades are warming the Earth is the way those lies are translated into government policies. The Obama administration, via the Environmental Protection Agency, has launched a war on coal-fired plants that produce 40% of the nation\u2019s electricity claiming that their emissions such as carbon dioxide (CO2) are causing a warming that is not happening. What is happening is a deliberate effort to drive up the cost of electricity for everyone.\n\nAmerica runs on electricity and 68% of it is generated by fossil fuels, 20% by nuclear, and 7% by hydropower. So called \u201cclean energy\u201d, wind and solar, provides about 4% at far higher costs than the others and exists largely due to government subsidies and mandates.\n\nClaims about increased severe storms, heat waves, and hurricanes simply have no basis in fact. In recent years there has been a record low in the numbers of tornadoes, hurricanes, no change in the rise of sea levels, but record gains in Arctic and Antarctic ice. None of this is reported by the mainstream media.\n\nYet Obama told graduates that rising temperatures and sea levels, as well as intensifying storm patterns represent \u201cone of the most significant long-term challenges that our country and our planet face.\u201d He said this even though his administration\u2019s recent National Climate Assessment acknowledged that \u201cThere has been no universal trend in the overall extent of drought across the continental U.S. since 1900.\u201d The report, however, is being used to justify carbon-related regulations.\n\nWhile the world\u2019s attention is on one of the greatest threats facing it, the takeover of northern Iraq by a barbaric Islamist group\u2014one from which even al Qaeda disassociated itself\u2014Obama is talking about non-existent climate threats to further policies that kill jobs in the U.S. and harm its struggling recovery of our economy.\n\nWhile the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) seeks to expand its control of a major portion of the Middle East, Obama thought it was more important to lie about the climate to college graduates.\n\nHow much more damage Obama can inflict on the economy between now and the end of his second term in office is unknown, but what we do know is that his priorities, based on scare-mongering speeches about the climate will continue until he leaves office.\n\n\u00a9 Alan Caruba, 2014\n\n[Originally published at Warning Signs]", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://blog.heartland.org/2014/06/obama-talks-climate-change-while-iraq-implodes/", "type": "activity", "image": "http://blog.heartland.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/snoww.jpg", "site_name": "Somewhat Reasonable", "title": "Obama Talks Climate Change While Iraq Implodes"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3cab\"", "article_summary": "In February, Holdren told reporters that all weather is impacted by climate change, but that is what climate change has done for 4.5 billion years.\nIt is depressing beyond words that we will have to endure two and a half more years of an endless stream of lies about climate change from President Obama.\nObama used the speech to demand that politicians take steps to acknowledge climate change which used to be called global warming until it became undeniable to everyone except the charlatans lining their pockets with utterly bogus \u201cresearch\u201d that underwrites the source of the lies, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).\nNot mentioned was that climate cycles are measured in centuries while weather is a short-term event.\nOn the same day the President was lying about warming, eight inches of snow fell in Rize, Turkey."}
