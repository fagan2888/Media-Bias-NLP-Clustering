In fact, that should be the only issue in every election until it\u2019s repealed.\n\nI also think all Republican candidates should be trained with shock collars and cattle prods to automatically respond, upon hearing some combination of the words \u201cabortion,\u201d \u201crape,\u201d and \u201cincest\u201d: \u201cYes, of course there should be exceptions in the case of rape or incest, and I also support giving rapists the death penalty, unlike my Democratic opponent, who wants to give rapists the right to vote. Now, back to what I was saying about Obamacare \u2026\u201d\n\nYet and still, I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s news that the New York Times ran into some kids at CPAC who are \u201cpro-free market on fiscal issues and libertarian on social ones.\u201d (\u201cYoung Republicans Find Fault With Elders on List of Social Issues,\u201d March 10.)\n\nFirst of all, young people are idiots. I love them, I was one once myself \u2013 but they\u2019re idiots. We\u2019ll be interested in their opinions on the basic rules of civilization as soon as they have one of three things: a household to run, a mortgage or school-aged children. Being in college is like living in Disneyland.\n\nSecond, I\u2019ve been reading that same column in the New York Times every few months for the last 20 years. Whether it\u2019s abortion, gays, God or drugs, Times reporters are like bloodhounds in sniffing out Republicans \u2014 often kids \u2014 who are \u201cpro-free market on fiscal issues and libertarian on social ones.\u201d If something has been trending for decades without ever really catching on, it\u2019s probably not about to sweep the nation.\n\nIn 1988, the Times claimed Congress had \u201clost its taste for the social agenda\u201d and quoted Sen. Warren Rudman of New Hampshire \u2014 one of the GOP\u2019s last liberals and, consequently, the Times\u2018 lodestar for all things Republican -\u2013 saying that people like himself \u201cfelt deeply\u201d that the social issues should be dumped.\n\nIn 1989, the Times was all atwitter about three typical Republicans who opposed the GOP\u2019s pro-life position. These \u201cstalwart Republicans\u201d were: Barbara Gimbel of Manhattan (Gimbels department store heiress), Barbara Mosbacher of Manhattan (banking heiress) and Pauline Harrison of Manhattan (DuPont heiress). All vowed not to support any pro-life candidates \u2014 except Harrison, \u201cbecause she had recently been appointed to the Republican State Committee representing the 66th Assembly District on Manhattan\u2019s East Side.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a reason you never hear the expression, \u201cAs goes Manhattan\u2019s Upper East Side, so goes the nation.\u201d\n\nIn 1990, the Times heralded the formation of a pro-choice Republican group, consisting primarily of Ann Stone and her husband, Roger.\n\nIn 1992, the Times missed the masses of socially conservative delegates at the Republican National Convention, but somehow bumped into several people who wanted to drop the family and God references.\n\nIn 1996 \u2014 nearly 20 years ago! \u2014 guess what the Times said young voters cared about? Young people were: \u201cConservative on economic issues and liberal-leaning on social issues like health care and abortion.\u201d It\u2019s almost as if today\u2019s generation of whippersnappers is exactly like their middle-aged counterparts 20 years ago!\n\nIn 1999, the Times reported that Republicans were \u201crepositioning\u201d themselves on the abortion issue, based on their recognition that \u201ca more tolerant position\u201d would help the GOP win the White House.

Bush won the presidency.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Ann Coulter", "description": "The paper of record has been proclaiming the end of the culture war since 1988.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Let me begin by saying that I think the only issue in the 2014 election should be Obamacare.
