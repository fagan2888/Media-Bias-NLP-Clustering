With two weeks left in the regular season, many teams still have hope of playing in the postseason. The top two seeds can be determined in the AFC and the NFC. The Jets are in a nearly must-win situation for a playoff berth, while the Patriots can lock up the AFC’s best record and home-field advantage. The Cardinals and Packers have locked up playoff slots, but their game is about a shot at a first-round bye.

Game of the week:

Packers (10-4) at Cardinals (12-2); 2:25 p.m., KDVR-31

Arizona has arguably the best offense in football to go with its turnover-causing defense. The Packers haven’t looked right all season, but they’re in the driver’s seat for the NFC North title.

Patriots (12-2) at Jets (9-5), 11 a.m.

The Jets, who have won four straight, have the type of defense that has given the Patriots fits this season. New York can’t afford another loss, with the Chiefs and Steelers also fighting for the AFC’s two wild-card slots.

Texans (7-7) at Titans (3-11), 11 a.m.

It’s in your hands, Houston. Beat the Titans without Marcus Mariota, then Jacksonville in Week 17 to capture the AFC South title.

Browns (3-11) at Chiefs (9-5) , 11 a.m.

Kansas City’s eight-game winning streak has put it in prime playoff position, while putting heat on Denver in the AFC West.

Colts (6-8) at Dolphins (5-9), 11 a.m.

Indy’s playoff hopes could end against Miami in a battle of two underachieving teams.

49ers (4-10) at Lions (5-9), 11 a.m.

San Francisco is a double-digit underdog to a bad Detroit team. That’s all you need to know about the 49ers’ season.

Cowboys (4-10) at Bills (6-8), 11 a.m.

The quarterback conversation will be interesting come draft time, because Tony Romo can’t stay healthy and Dallas can’t win without him.

Bears (5-9) at Buccaneers (6-8), 11 a.m.

The Lovie Bowl, with Tampa Bay head coach Lovie Smith facing his former team. Both have shown flashes of success but lack the talent both sides of the ball to compete for a playoff berth.

Panthers (14-0) at Falcons (7-7), 11 a.m.

Early in the season, this set up as a showdown. The teams met two weeks ago, with Carolina posting a 38-0 victory.

Steelers (9-5) at Ravens (4-10), 11 a.m.

The Ravens could salvage some pride from a lost season and severely damage the Steelers’ playoff chances.

Jaguars (5-9) at Saints (5-9), 2:05 p.m.

An offensive shootout is coming in New Orleans, as both teams rank in the league’s bottom three for most points allowed.

Rams (6-8) at Seahawks (9-5), 2:25 p.m.

Seattle can’t win its division, but can get the better of the two wild-card spots.

Giants (6-8) at Vikings (9-5), 6:30 p.m., KUSA-9

No Odell Beckham Jr. in a game New York needs to keep its playoff hopes alive. Minnesota locks up a playoff berth with a win.
