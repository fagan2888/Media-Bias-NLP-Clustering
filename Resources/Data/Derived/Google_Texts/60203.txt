The Fox News reporter who wrote about the Aurora movie theater gunman’s notebook won’t have to testify about how she learned about the crucial document because the U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday rejected an appeal on the matter.

Lawyers for James Holmes had appealed a New York court order shielding Jana Winter from testifying about her sources. On Tuesday, the Supreme Court announced that it had denied the appeal, known as a petition for certiorari.

Winter reported that the notebook, which Holmes mailed to his psychiatrist just before the deadly attack on the Century Aurora 16 movie theater in July 2012, contained violent drawings and plans. She cited unnamed law enforcement sources in her report.

Because Winter is based in New York, courts in two states had to approve her subpoena. After the trial court in Colorado did so, the highest court in New York ultimately blocked the subpoena there because it said Winter was protected under the state’s shield law for journalists.

In a statement issued after Tuesday’s ruling, Fox News said the decision was an important victory for journalists’ rights.

“We’re pleased that the Supreme Court has ruled in favor of free speech today,” the statement reads. “The Court made it clear that Jana Winter can never be compelled to testify in Colorado, and that all New York-based journalists and media companies can rely on New York’s strong shield law when they are covering news across the country.”

Tuesday’s ruling clears up one more outstanding issue that could have further delayed the trial, which is currently scheduled to start in October with jury selection.

Holmes faces 166 counts of murder, attempted murder and other offenses and could be sentenced to death if convicted. He has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity.
