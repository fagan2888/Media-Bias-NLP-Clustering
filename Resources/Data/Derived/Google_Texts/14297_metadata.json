Marco Rubio justifies skipping not one, but two critical Senate votes aimed at defunding Planned Parenthood. Rubio says those were \u201cshow votes,\u201d and that only by electing a Republican president can taxpayers hope to stop sending $500 million to the baby body parts trafficker every year.\n\nConservative grassroots voters, feeling betrayed by a GOP that immediately funded President Obama\u2019s illegal executive amnesty for law-breaking foreigners and sold out U.S. sovereignty to a hugely unpopular global governance deal known as the Trans Pacific Partnership, appear to be turning up the heat on establishment candidates.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nRubio shifted the frame, subtly reinforcing the notion that Congress is hopeless so long there is no Republican in the Oval Office wielding the pen. Senator Rubio is a victim of the system; President Rubio would run it.\n\n\u201cWhat you just described is why I\u2019m running for president. I\u2019m not even running for re-election in the Senate. I\u2019m running for president because we can\u2019t change any of this unless we have people like that in the presidency,\u201d Rubio said, according to the Des Moines Register. \u201cBut we need to fight them in the court of public opinion. That\u2019s the other thing we have to do. Sometimes they don\u2019t even try.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have these horrifying [Planned Parenthood] videos put out,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cAnd instead of saying: \u2018We\u2019re going to spend two to three months going out and into town halls, and aggressively talking to people about what this means, and convincing people that aren\u2019t convinced yet, that we\u2019re right on his cause so they can pressure their senator or congressman to vote the right way.\u2019\u201d\n\nExactly to whom Rubio talking is unclear: Those who watched the videos of Planned Parenthood operatives discussing dismembered babies over salads and cabernet or laughing while looking at a baby boy ripped to pieces on a table are either 1) against giving Planned Parenthood another cent of their tax dollars, or 2) liberals with a deficient sense of disgust who project what revulsion they can feel onto political opponents. Mass media allows instant, nationwide distribution of the Planned Parenthood exposes carried out by genius David Daleiden and his Center for Medical Progress team. Senators aren\u2019t needed to act as conduits to the public.\n\n\u201cWhat do they say instead?\u201d Rubio continued. \u201c\u2018We\u2019ll, we\u2019re not going to win this vote anyway so we\u2019ll do a show vote, but ultimately the president\u2019s not going to sign it and we lost. If you don\u2019t even try, of course you lost. And more importantly, you haven\u2019t set the table for the time when you can make that difference,\u201d Rubio said.\n\nAt least Rubio admits the incompetence of GOP leadership in the Senate, with Majority Leader Mitch McConnell at the helm. Yet he uses it as leverage to beg voters to elect more Republicans. This is a familiar ploy: Elect more of us, and we\u2019ll deliver. As Texas Sen. Ted Cruz said in a speech to the Senate last week, Republicans told voters in 2010 that they needed a majority in the House to repeal Obamacare. Then, in 2014, they told voters they needed a majority in the Senate to stop Obama\u2019s executive amnesty. Now, having both failed to stop parts of Obama\u2019s agenda and pushed others, they want the same voters they spit on to deliver to them the presidency.\n\nRubio has the worst attendance record in the Senate: He missed 81 votes this year alone. After delivering calculated speeches to earnest pro-life audiences, he skipped the two votes to fund Planned Parenthood and the government, failing to go on the record as an opponent to the abortion mill.\n\nEmail Katie at kmchugh@breitbart.com.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Florida Sen.
