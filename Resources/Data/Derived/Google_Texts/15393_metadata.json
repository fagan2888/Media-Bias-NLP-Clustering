Meanwhile, hospitals in states that are not expanding eligibility saw little variation in their share of Medicaid and self-pay patients.\n\nSince Medicare\u2019s average share of hospital revenue mostly held steady over the same time period, the increase in Medicaid \u201ccannot be explained by an overall rise in total volume of patients attending hospitals or overall costs of care due to other structural changes in the healthcare sector,\u201d wrote researchers at the Colorado Hospital Association.\n\nThe study highlights a disparity in hospital financing across the country, with those in states that aren\u2019t expanding eligibility facing a continuing responsibility for uncompensated care, along with Medicare cuts that were supposed to be offset by more patients insured by Medicaid.\n\n\u201cThese findings not only affirm that more people are finding healthcare coverage who didn\u2019t have it before, but also that it is having a positive impact by reducing the levels of uncompensated care at hospitals, which could further efforts to reduce healthcare costs,\u201d said the association\u2019s president and CEO Steven Summer.\n\nMedicaid a boon for hospitals\n\nIn Colorado, one of 26 states that are opening Medicaid to childless, low-income adults, hospitals\u2019 Medicaid revenue has grown faster than average \u2014 now representing on average 20 percent of their base, according to the study. Health systems with primary care practices in Colorado and elsewhere are also benefiting from a boost, albeit temporarily. For 2013 and 2014, as directed by the ACA, Medicaid is paying primary care docs at Medicare fee levels for about 150 evaluation and management and vaccine administration codes.\n\nMany of those health systems are participating in Colorado\u2019s Medicaid accountable care program, which now covers about half of the state\u2019s beneficiaries. In its first full year, the program saw a 15 percent reduction in hospital admissions and a 25 percent reduction in high-cost imaging in the 2013 fiscal year, contributing to $44 million in savings, with most going to providers as incentive bonuses and $6 million returning to state coffers.\n\n[See also: ACOs get down to brass tacks.]\n\nElsewhere, Medicaid programs are very much in flux. In New York, hospitals are bringing in additional revenue for Medicaid patients who may have been previously uninsured, while facing a new restructuring of the program.\n\nAfter paring back the growth rate of New York\u2019s $54 billion Medicaid program, Governor Andrew Cuomo won a waiver from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to invest $8 billion in a larger redesign over the next five years, with its main aim being reducing avoidable admissions by 25 percent. Nonprofit hospitals, physicians and community groups are being tasked with creating demonstration projects focusing on home and community-based care.\n\nIn North Carolina, where one-third of hospitals are in the red and where a Medicaid revenue assessment is set to increase, health systems are supporting ideas in the legislature to introduce a new model of accountable care organizations in Medicaid. The proposal to use Accountable Care Organizations is a step in the right direction and would align Medicaid with the innovations already underway for Medicare and privately insured patients,\u201d the North Carolina Hospital Association said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/much-needed-boost-medicaid", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/456900049.jpg", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Hospitals in states that have expanded Medicaid eligibility under the Affordable Care Act are already bringing in fewer self-pay and charity care patient cases, according to an analysis by the Colorado Hospital Association.", "title": "As Medicaid expands, hospitals see declines in charity care, self pay"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/456900049.jpg"}, "description": "Hospitals in states that have expanded Medicaid eligibility under the Affordable Care Act are already bringing in fewer self-pay and charity care patient cases, according to an analysis by the Colorado Hospital Association.", "site": "@HC_Finance", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "As Medicaid expands, hospitals see declines in charity care, self pay"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "As Medicaid enrollment grows to record levels, covering 65 million people nationwide, providers are starting to see some positive trends in their rates of uncompensated care.&#13; Hospitals in states that have expanded Medicaid eligibility under the Affordable Care Act are already bringing in fewer self-pay and charity care patient cases, according to an analysis by the Colorado Hospital Association.", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2712\"", "article_summary": "[See also: Medicaid care expansion: Two test cases.]\nMany of those health systems are participating in Colorado\u2019s Medicaid accountable care program, which now covers about half of the state\u2019s beneficiaries.\nMeanwhile, hospitals in states that are not expanding eligibility saw little variation in their share of Medicaid and self-pay patients.\nHospitals in states that have expanded Medicaid eligibility under the Affordable Care Act are already bringing in fewer self-pay and charity care patient cases, according to an analysis by the Colorado Hospital Association.\nIn New York, hospitals are bringing in additional revenue for Medicaid patients who may have been previously uninsured, while facing a new restructuring of the program."}
