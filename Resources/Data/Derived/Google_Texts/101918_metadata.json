Since 2012, the Wake Forest University professor has \u201ceducated\u201d her audiences in the ways of racism, evil conservatives and anti-American ideals. It was hard to pick just ten, but here\u2019s a look back on some of Harris-Perry\u2019s craziest rants and stunts.\n\n1. Kids Don\u2019t \u201cBelong to Their Parents\u201d They \u201cBelong to the Whole Community\u201d\n\nIn a April 2013 ad for MSNBC\u2019s \u201cLean Forward\u201d campaign, Harris-Perry lamented that Americans didn\u2019t think of their kids as public property:\n\nWe have never invested as much in public education as we should have, because we\u2019ve always had kind of a private notion of children...We haven\u2019t had a very collective notion of these are our children\u2026.We have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents, or kids belong to their families, and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.\n\n2. \u201cHard worker\u201d Is a Racist Phrase\n\nAfter Harris-Perry\u2019s guest Alfonso Aguilar, (Latino Partnership for Conservative Principles), called Paul Ryan a \u201chard worker,\u201d on her October 24, 2015 show, Harris-Perry scolded him and acted as if she has been slapped in the face:\n\nI want us to be super careful when we use the language \u2018hard worker,\u2019 because I actually keep and image of folks working in cotton fields on my office wall, because it is a reminder about what hard work looks like. So I feel you that he\u2019s a hard worker, I do, but in the context of relative privilege.\n\n3. Star Wars Is Racist; Darth Vader Is a \u201cTotally Black Guy\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s hard to make this stuff up. On Harris-Perry\u2019s December 13, 2015 show, she complained that Star Wars was racist because Darth Vader was being \u201ctotally a black guy\u201d by being portrayed by James Earl Jones. She ranted that \u201cwhile he was black\u201d he \u2018was terrible and bad and awful\u201d and \u201cused to cut off white men\u2019s hands and didn\u2019t, you know, actually claim his son.\u201d\n\n4. \u201cObamacare\u201d Is a Racist Phrase, Too!\n\nOn her December 8, 2013 show, Harris-Perry ranted that the phrase \u201cObamacare\u201d was actually a \u201cderogatory\u201d phrase made up by \u201cwealthy white men\u201d and \u201cmeant to shame and divide and demean\u201d President Obama. Who knew?\n\nI want to talk today about a controversial word. It\u2019s a word that has been with us for years, and like it or not, it\u2019s indelibly printed in the pages of American history. A word that was originally intended as a derogatory term, meant to shame and divide and demean. The word was conceived of by a group of wealthy white men who needed a way to put themselves above and apart from a black man, to render him inferior and unequal and to diminish his accomplishments...Y\u2019all know the word that I\u2019m talking about: Obamacare.\n\nFunny enough, she used the word herself just two weeks before her harsh condemnation of it.\n\n5. Americans Are \u201ca Plague on the Rest of the World\u201d\n\nBringing on guests to discuss Obama planning to reopen a relationship with Cuba, Harris-Perry fretted that American tourism would be bad for Cuba\u2019s Communist economy, calling it \u201ccultural hegemony.\u201d On the April 11, 2015 show she said:\n\nOn the one hand, it is great to reopen these relationships. On the other hand, I worry about American tourists and the ways that we can sometimes be a plague on the rest of the world, particularly in these nations that become high-tourist economies. And I\u2019m wondering if there is a downside to our economic ties opening up with Cuba, for Cuba.\n\n6. Could Rachel Dolezal Be \u201cTrans-Black\u201d?\n\nFor someone so obsessed with racism, it\u2019s ironic that the MSNBC host couldn\u2019t assign any to her liberal friend, NAACP President of Washington Rachel Dolezal. On her June 13 show last year, Harris-Perry wondered if the white Dolezal, who had been pretending to be black, was in fact \u201ctrans-black.\u201d The MSNBC host asked her guest, \u201cIs it possible that she might actually be black?\u201d before launching into a convoluted rant about how some women are born \u201ccis-black\u201d and others are born \u201ctrans-black\u201d (ie: white).\n\n7. Wearing Tampon Earrings to Fight for \u201cReproductive Rights\u201d (or Something)\n\nIn one of her first political stunts in 2013, the MSNBC host brought out a pair of handmade \u201ctampon earrings\u201d put them on and proceeded to lecture her audience on \u201creproductive rights\u201d by completely misrepresenting a recent event in the Texas legislature.\n\nI just have to show these. My producer Lorena made for me last week some tampon earrings because of course you\u2019re remember that the Texas state legislature said that you couldn\u2019t bring tampons in when they were going these women to in fact stand up for their own reproductive rights. You weren\u2019t allowed initially to bring tampons. So, just in case that ever happens again ladies, you can just bring them on your earrings.\n\nBut what Harris-Perry didn\u2019t say was that every small throw-able item in a protester\u2019s possession was confiscated by police, not just feminine hygiene products.\n\n8. I hope Trayvon \u201cWhooped the Shit Out of George Zimmerman\u201d\n\nLast February at Cornell University, the MSNBC host told students that she hoped Trayvon Martin \u201cwhooped the shit out of George Zimmerman,\u201d a statement which earned her applause from her audience.\n\n9. Illegal Immigrants Are Beheld to a \u2018Fugitive Slave Law\u2019\n\nDiscussing the Flint water crisis February 1, Harris-Perry compared illegal immigrants to fugitive slaves in a statement so loony that it makes you want to ask, \u201cDoes she even know how illegal immigration works?\u201d\n\nI don't want the Obama administration\u2019s final year to be marred by a fugitive slave law around the question of this deportation that leads in the context of Flint to actual children being actually poisoned by lead because their parents are too afraid to open the door for clean water.\n\n10. America \u201cWas Stolen,\u201d Built on \u201cImperialism\u201d \u201cGenocide\u201d and \u201cSlavery\u201d\n\nTo honor Independence Day, Harris-Perry went on an anti-American rant against the country which gave her the freedom to do so, on her July 1, 2012 program. Blasting the Founding Fathers for \u201cstealing\u201d this country, she claimed America was built on \u201cimperialism\u201d \u201cgenocide\u201d and slavery.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "NewsBusters", "description": "After having a meltdown last Friday, it\u2019s been revealed that MSNBC\u2019s most insufferable host Melissa Harris-Perry, has been let go from her four-year stint at the left-wing cable network.
