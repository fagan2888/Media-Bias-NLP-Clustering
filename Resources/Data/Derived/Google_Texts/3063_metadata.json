Landrieu and her liberal Democrats have been in charge in the Senate since the last two years of the administration of President George W. Bush until now. They also had control of the House for the last two years of the Bush administration and the first two years of President Barack Obama\u2019s term. All the debt incurred is on Landrieu, U.S. Sen. Harry Reid and Obama, since Obama\u2019s presidency.\n\nI wonder if the moratorium in the Gulf affected Pellerin the way it did for many other energy companies. Where was Landrieu on that?\n\nPellerin cites her backing of raising the minimum wage and her being against tax breaks for the \u201cwealthy\u201d as she lives in her Washington million dollar mansion. Pellerin and other liberals can pay an employee $20 or $30 an hour, if they choose. Why stop at $10 an hour? Does Mr. Pellerin\u2019s CPA suggest he not use the tax breaks since they are only for the \u201cwealthy?\u201d\n\nObama is in the 39 percent bracket, but only paid around 25 percent. This is nothing but a straw man to divert attention from her support of Obamacare which caused millions to lose their health coverage and from her free spending at our expense.\n\nThis is Landrieu\u2019s record: She voted for gutting the greatest health care system in the world, for policies resulting in record amounts of poverty and the largest amount of non-working Americans since World War II, for policies which keep her constituents depending on government and in turn keep her and others like her in power.\n\nAl Louviere\n\nLafayette\n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.theadvertiser.com/story/opinion/2014/09/07/another-look-landrieus-record/15261999/", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "She voted for gutting the greatest health care system in the world, for policies resulting in record amounts of poverty and the largest amount of non-working Americans since World War II, for policies which keep her constituents depending on government and in turn keep her and others like her in power.", "og": {"site_name": "The Advertiser", "description": "She voted for gutting the greatest health care system in the world, for policies resulting in record amounts of poverty and the largest amount of non-working Americans since World War II, for policies which keep her constituents depending on government and in turn keep her and others like her in power.", "title": "Another look at Landrieu\u2019s record", "url": "http://www.theadvertiser.com/story/opinion/2014/09/07/another-look-landrieus-record/15261999/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/theadvertiser.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "She voted for gutting the greatest health care system in the world, for policies resulting in record amounts of poverty and the largest amount of non-working Americans since World War II, for policies which keep her constituents depending on government and in turn keep her and others like her in power.", "creator": "@theadvertiser", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f160e2f2c0b7edf174233173fc250705280e9ec8/c=670-0-3322-2652&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/LafayetteLA/2014/09/07/tdabrd07-06-2014advertiser1a00520140705imgtdabrd06-24-2014ad11.jpg", "title": "Another look at Landrieu\u2019s record", "site": "@theadvertiser", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=743844896", "fb": {"app_id": 150147415035780}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": ""}, "article_summary": "Buy Photo Mary Landrieu U.S. Sen.
