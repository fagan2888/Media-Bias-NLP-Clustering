As you determinedly make your way to the produce aisle, you pass by the cookie aisle and have an impulse to stroll through to see if they have updated your favorite line of cookies. While it seems like a harmless stroll through the sweets aisle, it can be detrimental to your body\u2019s health. According to the Boston Medical Center, approximately 45 million Americans diet each year and spend $33 billion annually on weight loss products, but nearly two-thirds of Americans in the United States are overweight or obese.\n\nDieters who want to lose the pounds may have a difficult time following a healthy eating regime, especially when they are bombarded by junk food ads that promote unhealthy but tasty foods. Primes at grocery stores may help shoppers choose healthy food choices and reduce their spending on junk food. Obese shoppers who are given a recipe flyer with a few health-related words spend less than one-third the amount on unhealthy snacks as those given the same flyer without health-related wording, according to a recent study.\n\nFindings published in the International Journal of Obesity revealed that subtle cues can aid obese shoppers in opting for healthy foods while curbing their appetite for junk food and decreasing their spending. Dutch researchers handed recipe flyers to 99 shoppers \u2014 42 overweight and obese, and 57 normal-weight people \u2014 on their way into a grocery store. The team of researchers designed two versions of a recipe flyer. One flyer had words such as \u201chealthy\u201d and \u201cgood for your figure\u201d and noted how many calories that a certain dish contained. The other recipe flyer contained non-health-related words such as \u201ctry it out\u201d and \u201cnew recipe.\u201d\n\nOverweight participants who received the health-related flyer spent an estimated $1.40 on junk food including cookies, candy, and chips, while those who received the other flyer spent an estimated $4.80. For normal-weight participants, no difference was reported in the amount of money spent on snacks, Reuters Health reports.\n\nThirty study participants reported to not have paid attention to the flyer; therefore, the researchers did not find an association between the flyer that the participants received and how much money they spent on snacks. However, the overweight participants who paid some attention to the health-related flyer were found to reduce their snack spending regardless of whether they reported thinking about it as they shopped.\n\n\"Subtle cues can have a strong impact on our behavior, without us noticing. Fortunately, this is true not only for tempting food that surrounds us and makes self-control difficult - it also works for subtle cues that remind us of our health and dieting goals,\" said Esther K. Papies, of Utrecht University in the Netherlands, to Reuters Health.\n\nThese subtle cues, or messages, are not meant to be condescending or to make shoppers feel like they are being told what to do. They are meant to recommend healthy food alternatives that can overall improve their body.\n\nPapies believes that there should be less cues centered on junk food and more health-positive posters throughout food markets. While this health initiative is being explored, she recommends shoppers to put these cues on their grocery lists as a means to reinforce healthy food ideals.\n\nCurrently, obesity is a health epidemic that affects more than one-third of U.S. adults, according to the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "obese, shoppers, subtle cues healthy foods, junk food", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Subtle cues are found to aid obese shoppers with healthy food choices while decreasing spending on junk food.", "title": "Obese Shoppers Choose Healthy Foods With Help Of Subtle Cues", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/obese-shoppers-choose-healthy-foods-help-subtle-cues-decrease-spending-junk-food-255852", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/06/overweight-biker.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Subtle cues are found to aid obese shoppers with healthy food choices while decreasing spending on junk food.", "title": "Obese Shoppers Choose Healthy Foods With Help Of Subtle Cues", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/obese-shoppers-choose-healthy-foods-help-subtle-cues-decrease-spending-junk-food-255852", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/06/overweight-biker.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/06/overweight-biker.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2013-09-06T14:09:27-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-25T11:25:26-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Subtle cues are found to aid obese shoppers with healthy food choices while decreasing spending on junk food."}, "article_summary": "Primes at grocery stores may help shoppers choose healthy food choices and reduce their spending on junk food.\nPapies believes that there should be less cues centered on junk food and more health-positive posters throughout food markets.\nFindings published in the International Journal of Obesity revealed that subtle cues can aid obese shoppers in opting for healthy foods while curbing their appetite for junk food and decreasing their spending.\nThey are meant to recommend healthy food alternatives that can overall improve their body.\nWhile this health initiative is being explored, she recommends shoppers to put these cues on their grocery lists as a means to reinforce healthy food ideals."}
