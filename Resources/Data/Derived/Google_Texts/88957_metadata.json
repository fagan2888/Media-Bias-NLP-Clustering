Jeff Miller, Florida Republican and chair of the House Veterans Affairs\u2019 Committee, said the bill would allow the VA secretary to rescind a bonus whenever he deemed it appropriate, though the employee would have a chance to appeal the secretary\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cI believe the ability to recoup a bonus based on bad or manipulated performance data is a tool the secretary needs and that the American public would expect,\u201d Mr. Miller said at a hearing.\n\nLast year, a whistleblower at the Phoenix VA hospital alleged that veterans were dying while waiting for care on secret lists in an effort to make wait times appear shorter than they were and thus secure large bonuses for the bosses. Under Mr. Miller\u2019s proposal, the VA would be able to take those bonuses back if it was discovered that they were awarded for fraudulent data.\n\nThe VA has paid more than $380,000 to top executives at 38 hospitals across the country that are currently under investigation for falsifying wait times as part of last year\u2019s scandal, according to a release from Mr. Miller\u2019s office.\n\nWhen previously questioned on whether or not they could recoup bonuses, VA officials told the committee they were unsure if they had that authority. Mr. Miller said this bill would clear up the confusion.\n\nSEE ALSO: Congressional veterans: \u2018American Sniper\u2019 a realistic portrait of sacrifice, war\u2019s toll\n\nAleks Morosky, deputy director of the national legislative service for Veterans of Foreign Wars, said employees who are putting veterans\u2019 lives at risk or fraudulently serving the government shouldn\u2019t be eligible to keep a bonus.\n\n\u201cWe feel like bonuses should be awarded for exceptional performance,\u201d he said. \u201cClearly anybody who is putting veterans at risk or defrauding the government is not serving exceptionally.\u201d\n\nBlake Ortner, the deputy government relations director for Paralyzed Veterans of America, said that while his organization supported the intent of the law to hold VA employees more accountable, there were some concerns about details, such as how long after awarding a bonus the department could decide to take it back and who would preside over appeal hearings so the secretary wasn\u2019t ruling on his own decisions.\n\nThe appeal hearing\u2019s decision would be final and not subject to additional appeals, the bill states.\n\nSome VA employees and lawmakers have worried that the department is still too focused on rewarding quantity over quality, which they say will lead to data manipulation in both health care and claims processing as employees rush to meet performance goals and earn bonuses.\n\nThe VA had no opinion to share on the bill, saying that it was still looking into what changes it would make across the government and would submit a position to Congress when it had finished its research.\n\n\u201cWe note that this legislation could change laws outside of our department and as such are consulting with other government agencies,\u201d said David McLenachen, acting deputy undersecretary for disability assistance at the Veterans Benefits Administration.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Veterans advocates mostly supported a bill on Tuesday that would allow the VA secretary to take back a bonus if an employee was found to have been manipulating data.", "Author": "Jacqueline Klimas", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Veterans advocates mostly supported a bill on Tuesday that would allow the VA secretary to take back a bonus if an employee was found to have been manipulating data.", "title": "Jeff Miller\u2019s VA bill to rescind bonuses gets backing by veterans advocates", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jan/27/jeff-millers-va-bill-rescind-bonuses-gets-backing-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/17/12172014_ap4240846205208201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/17/12172014_ap4240846205208201.jpg", "title": "Jeff Miller\u2019s VA bill to rescind bonuses gets backing by veteran", "description": "Veterans advocates mostly supported a bill on Tuesday that would allow the VA secretary to take back a bonus if an employee was found to have been manipulating data.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Health Medical Pharma, Politics, Social Issues, Phoenix Va Hospital, Jeff Miller"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd06d9\"", "article_summary": "When previously questioned on whether or not they could recoup bonuses, VA officials told the committee they were unsure if they had that authority.\nVeterans advocates mostly supported a bill Tuesday that would allow the VA secretary to take back a bonus if an employee was found to have been manipulating data.\nMr. Miller said this bill would clear up the confusion.\nUnder Mr. Miller\u2019s proposal, the VA would be able to take those bonuses back if it was discovered that they were awarded for fraudulent data.\nRep.
