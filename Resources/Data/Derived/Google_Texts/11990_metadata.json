Soon after, New York state announced a plan to raise the minimum wage of all fast food workers to $15, and the state\u2019s governor, Andrew Cuomo, recently said he believes it should apply to all workers.\n\nMany of these plans start from the assumption, implicitly or explicitly, that these minimum wage hikes would be relatively cost-free, pointing to several studies seeming to show that increases in the minimum wage don\u2019t have much effect on jobs.\n\nHere is what the author of some of the most influential of those studies, former Obama administration economic adviser Alan B. Krueger, had to say about raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour in an op-ed for The New York Times last week:\n\n15 an hour is beyond international experience, and could well be counterproductive. Although some high-wage cities and states could probably absorb a $15-an-hour minimum wage with little or no job loss, it is far from clear that the same could be said for every state, city and town in the United States.\n\nKrueger goes on to warn of greater risk, and the potential for \"severe\" trade-offs, if policymakers pursue a $15 minimum wage, warning that it would go beyond what any research supports. Ultimately, he concludes, it is \u201ca risk not worth taking. \u201d\n\nKrueger wasn\u2019t disowning his own work or abandoning his position. He still supports raising the minimum wage to $12 an hour over a period of years, which he thinks could be done with essentially no job loss.\n\nThere are some reasons to be skeptical of that claim too: The Congressional Budget Office, which generally tries to take a moderate approach to economic evidence and put its estimates right in the middle of the consensus range, found that even a more modest hike to $10.10 an hour nationally would most likely cost about a half a million jobs, and while it\u2019s possible such a raise might produce minimal job loss, it\u2019s equally possible that it would cost a million jobs.\n\nOverall, as David Neumark and William Wascher have found, the bulk of the evidence from research into the minimum wage suggests that hikes tend to decrease employment.\n\nThe point is that Krueger\u2019s research, while notable and worth paying attention to, is on the edge of what the evidence can possibly support.\n\nBut Democrats like Sanders who support a $15 federal minimum wage have gone far beyond even that. There is no evidence whatsoever to support such a move, which would be, at best, a foolish gamble with the nation's economy.\n\nIt is especially telling that Sanders\u2019 call for a higher federal minimum wage came in the midst of a related call to create millions of jobs through infrastructure projects, and fears that trade has cost the nation employment too (it hasn\u2019t). Sanders says he wants to create millions of jobs. But he\u2019s proposing policies that might well destroy them.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "This is an idea that\u2019s become increasingly common amongst more liberal Democratic politicians and policymakers.", "title": "Sorry, Bernie Sanders.
