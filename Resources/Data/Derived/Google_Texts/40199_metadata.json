Non-state residents will pay 2.8 percent more for general tuition \u2013 or $ 432 per semester \u2014 and a facilities fee of $55 per semester, for a total increase of 3.19 percent.\n\nThe fee increases, plus anticipated enrollment growth, will generate approximately $11 million, which will help cover anticipated cost increases of $15 million from a state-mandated pay raise for faculty and staff, increased employee retirement expenses and increased health insurance costs mandated by the federal Affordable Care Act.\n\nIn addition to partial funding for the mandatory pay raise, the state budget provided $1.2 million for programs to increase four-year graduation rates and provide paid, on-campus internships, programs that university President James P. Clements said will help hold down the cost of education in the long run and increase the value of a Clemson education.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate the state\u2019s targeted investment in these two programs that will help students be more successful in the classroom and in the job market,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of the best ways to hold down college costs is to get through in four years \u2013 and one of the best ways to land a job after graduation is an internship that provides relevant, marketable job skills.\u201d\n\nStudent housing and meal plans will increase by an average of 2.3 percent, which will cover rising food and energy costs, insurance and retirement costs, facilities renovations and a 2 percent cost-of-living pay increase for staff mandated by the state.\n\nActual costs vary depending on housing assignments and dining plan selection. On average, the fee increase will add $47 per semester for housing and $50 per semester for dining plans.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Local News", "ib-analytics": "data", "item-publish-date": "Wed, 25 Jun 2014 23:14:56 EDT", "generator": "CoreMedia", "author": "James McCray", "og": {"site_name": "WYFF4", "description": "Clemson University trustees approved an increase for tuition starting this fall.", "title": "Clemson University trustees approve tuition increase", "url": "http://www.wyff4.com/news/clemson-university-trustees-approve-tuition-increase/26668658", "image": "http://www.wyff4.com/image/view/-/6294054/medRes/2/-/maxh/630/maxw/1200/-/13uqxqi/-/Clemson-University-generic---29120904.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.wyff4.com/news/clemson-university-trustees-approve-tuition-increase/26668658", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "wyff://content/article/26668658", "iphone": "wyff://content/article/26668658", "googleplay": "wyff://content/article/26668658"}, "name": {"ipad": "wyff", "iphone": "wyff", "googleplay": "wyff"}, "id": {"ipad": 505507641, "iphone": 505507641, "googleplay": "com.hearst.android.wyff"}}, "site": "@wyffnews4", "card": "app"}, "al": {"android": {"url": "wyff://content/article/26668658", "app_name": "wyff", "package": "com.hearst.android.wyff"}, "ios": {"url": "wyff://content/article/26668658", "app_store_id": 505507641, "app_name": "wyff"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 135671321180}, "keywords": "Clemson, University, Tution, Fees, Housing, Meal Plans, Increase", "google-site-verification": "LWpc590JPr9qDk05qHGWcq1nIo4PF7VlkN6wQmjiOb8", "news_keywords": "Clemson, University, Tution, Fees, Housing, Meal Plans, Increase", "description": "Clemson University trustees approved an increase for tuition starting this fall."}, "article_summary": "Clemson University trustees approved an increase for tuition starting this fall.\nOn average, the fee increase will add $47 per semester for housing and $50 per semester for dining plans.\nThe increase for tuition, housing and meal plans will go up by an average of less than 3 percent, which will partially offset mandatory payroll, retirement and health insurance cost increases.\nNon-state residents will pay 2.8 percent more for general tuition \u2013 or $ 432 per semester \u2014 and a facilities fee of $55 per semester, for a total increase of 3.19 percent.\nIn-state students will see an increase of 2.6 percent for general tuition \u2013 or $171 per semester \u2014 and pay a $25 per semester charge dedicated to facilities maintenance and renovations, bringing the total increase to 3 percent."}
