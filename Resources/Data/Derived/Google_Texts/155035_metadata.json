An employee making $8.25 per hour would make $17,160 a year.\n\nLevy is the executive director of the Colorado Center on Law and Policy but was not speaking on behalf of the organization on Tuesday and is not representing it in this article.\n\nLevy said she wants the city to consider making employment practices a more important element of their contracting process.\n\n\"I would just like to see the city pay some attention to it and consider changing its procurement practices,\" she said. \"It's not right to look for cost savings in any way possible and close your eyes to the consequences of those cost savings.\"\n\nWilner said she was naturally interested in the benefits employees receive after spending much of her career in nonprofit advocacy working toward improving conditions at nursing homes by improving job quality for workers. She has a doctorate in social welfare policy from Brandeis University.\n\nAn avid swimmer, she said has visited all of the city's rec centers over the past eight years and wants to see the custodial staff people treated fairly. She said the power to improve the job conditions is in the city's hands.\n\n\"It's not particularly about the company. I think that any municipality that is contracting out work needs to stipulate for themselves, based on their values what are the labor practices they want to espouse through their municipal contracting policies,\" she said.\n\nIssue may see greater attention in 2015\n\nCity manager Jane Brautigam at Tuesday's City Council meeting said Councilman Macon Cowles, alerted to the situation by Wilner, approached her about the issue late last year. She said Karen Rahn, director of human services, brought the idea of looking at establishing a living wage for Boulder employees to the city's human relations commission.\n\nShe said the commission has the issue on its agenda for this year, but the process will likely take extensive research from staff and recommended it be placed on the work plan for 2015.\n\nCouncilwoman Lisa Morzel also spoke with Wilner about the city's contracting policies late last year. As a vocal Walmart critic, Morzel said she is eager to address the issue but does not want to overload city staff with work in 2014.\n\n\"I think there is some interest on the part of council to really work on this. I think it's really important and belies the values of Boulder,\" she said. \"We worked very hard for affordable housing but if we can't provide wages that allow people to live here than we're really not realizing our vision.\"\n\nContact Camera Staff Writer Joe Rubino at 303-473-1328 or rubinoj@dailycamera.com", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/news/boulder/ci_26004977/former-state-rep-claire-levy-others-urge-boulder", "sailthru.author": "By Joe Rubino ,  Camera Staff Writer", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:26004977:view"}, "startDate": "2014-06-22T14:30:00-0600", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "Former state representative Claire Levy wants the city of Boulder to walk the walk, so to speak, when it comes to working with contractors that treat their employees fairly.", "title": "Ex-state Rep.
