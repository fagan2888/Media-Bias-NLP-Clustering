Following President Obama’s State of the Union address this evening, Congressman Gene Green issued the following statement in response:

“Tonight, in his last State of the Union address, President Barack Obama painted a picture of progress and unity, the strides that our great nation has made and the road ahead. I agree that our nation is stronger than ever, and that we’re working toward an even better and stronger future for the generations ahead. The United States remains a global leader in innovation, health care, and so much more.

“We have also made significant strides here at home. Seven years ago, our nation faced its worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. Today, the national economy is much stronger than it was in 2008, and unemployment is down from 10 percent to 5 percent.

“Thanks to the Affordable Care Act nearly 18 million previously uninsured Americans now have affordable, dependable health coverage. In our District alone, the uninsured rate has dropped from 41 percent to 32 percent between 2010 and 2014. This is significant progress in just a few years, but we still have more work to do, like expanding Medicaid, to ensure that health care is within reach for all Americans.

“Now, as ever, I am proud to be American. I’m optimistic about our nation’s future, and I look forward to continuing to work on our nation’s most pressing issues with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle.”
