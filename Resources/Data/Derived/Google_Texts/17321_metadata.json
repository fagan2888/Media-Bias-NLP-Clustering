He noted that when a president defies the express will of Congress, his power is at its \u201clowest ebb.\u201d\n\nRoberts was dissenting in the court\u2019s decision in the so-called Jerusalem passport case. President Obama \u2014 and George W. Bush before him \u2014 had refused to execute a law that would\u2019ve required him to list Israel as the country of birth for an American born in Jerusalem.\n\nThe court let Obama deny the passport listing, but Roberts wrote that Obama\u2019s power was at its lowest ebb. His point could serve as a marker for much of Obama\u2019s entire tenure, which has often seen presidential power at its lowest ebb \u2014 or in a \u201czone of twilight.\u201d\n\nBoth phrases are from a famous opinion written in 1952 by Justice Robert Jackson. He was writing about what he called \u201cthe actual art of governing.\u201d\n\nThis is the shortcoming that has hobbled Obama\u2019s presidency \u2014 on ObamaCare, immigration, gun control, trade and Iran, to name but a few issues.\n\nJackson was an FDR liberal of the first water, but he understood presidential powers fluctuate depending on relations with Congress. Only with the \u201cexpress or implied\u201d authorization of Congress, he wrote, can a president be said to \u201cpersonify the federal sovereignty.\u201d\n\n\u201cZone of twilight\u201d was the phrase Jackson used to describe the predicament where a president acts \u201cin absence of either a congressional grant or denial of authority,\u201d meaning when Congress is quiet. Either the president or Congress might have the authority, but \u201cits distribution is uncertain.\u201d\n\nA president\u2019s power is at its \u201clowest ebb,\u201d Jackson wrote, when he takes measures that are \u201cincompatible with the expressed or implied will of Congress.\u201d President Obama\u2019s troubles stem from the frequency with which he has found himself in the twilight zone or at the low ebb.\n\nThe Jerusalem case is the least of it. The law the president defied may have been passed by an almost unanimous Congress, but the case was still about a child\u2019s passport. A president skilled in the actual art of governing would\u2019ve found a compromise.\n\nThere are bigger cases. The ObamaCare poser currently before the court should have been an easy fix, if it\u2019s just, as the administration insists, about erroneous wording. Simply send it back to Congress for a rewrite.\n\nIt\u2019s turned into a titanic drama because Congress wouldn\u2019t come close to rewriting it the way the president wants. So he\u2019s now crosswise with the legislature. On the centerpiece of his entire domestic program, he can\u2019t personify the federal sovereignty.\n\nThe same is true for, say, gun control. The president wants to speak for the nation, but he\u2019s without the support of Congress. So his latest gambit is to issue a regulation banning certain bullets that Congress won\u2019t ban. He\u2019s in the twilight zone.\n\nOn some issues \u2014 trade, metadata collection, immigration \u2014 conservatives like me may be with him. But Congress isn\u2019t, at least not yet. Obama just can\u2019t speak for the federal sovereignty. Nor take a hint. So he\u2019s lurching around in the twilight zone, a weakened figure.\n\nWe\u2019re likely to see this thrown into sharp relief if he gets his deal with the Iranian ayatollahs. Congress doesn\u2019t like this appeasement. It\u2019s made that clear. There may not be a veto-proof majority in Congress against him, however.\n\nThat\u2019s what Jackson meant when he warned of acting against the \u201cexpress or implied\u201d will of Congress. The president, he wrote, has but \u201chis own constitutional powers minus any constitutional powers of Congress.\u201d\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean the president always loses. Obama defied the express will of Congress in, for example, refusing to enforce the Defense of Marriage Act. And he won. But it\u2019ll be difficult for him to speak with the full federal sovereignty while the two branches are apart.\n\nIt\u2019d be nice to think that whoever ends up as the next president will take this to heart. How wonderful it would be to have a president skilled enough in the actual art of governing as to speak with the authority of the full federal sovereignty.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "New York Post", "twitter": {"description": "As the Supreme Court staggers toward the end of its term, I keep thinking about a phrase quoted by Chief Justice John Roberts.
