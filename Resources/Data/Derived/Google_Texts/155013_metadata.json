Most people assumed voters would pick another Republican.\n\nMore than 60 percent of the district voted Republican in the 2004 presidential election; more than 57 percent did four years prior.\n\nInstead, this time, they chose humble, mustachioed Prentiss County Chancery Clerk Travis Childers over his more polished and better-funded GOP opponent, Southaven Mayor Greg Davis, in a May 2008 runoff.\n\nThe district didn\u2019t swing left. It stuck together, like it usually does.\n\nNestled into the hills of northeast Mississippi, the 1st District boasts some of the state\u2019s most conservative residents. They\u2019re hardworking, church-going, community-minded folks who grow soybeans, build cars and shout \u201cHotty Toddy\u201d or clang a cowbell every Saturday.\n\nTheir big cities include Tupelo and the DeSoto County hubs of Southaven, Olive Branch and Horn Lake. Not far behind are Columbus and West Point \u2014 two-thirds of the Golden Triangle \u2014 as well as Corinth and Oxford, home to the University of Mississippi.\n\nMost of its 756,400 residents, though, live in rural areas.\n\nAnd while they don\u2019t always agree, the people have a long history of collaborating on projects benefiting them all. Case in point: The tri-county PUL Alliance that shared resources to develop a megasite and then successfully recruited Toyota to open a manufacturing plant there. Or the CREATE Foundation, a nonprofit committed to improving the quality of life for all residents in the 16-county region.\n\n\u201cIt could be one of the most solid areas in terms of being able to work together,\u201d said Vaughn Grisham, a sociologist who has studied the region extensively through his work with the McLean Institute for Community Development at the University of Mississippi.\n\nSo when confronted with an outside candidate \u2014 although in the 1st District, Southaven is considered by many as a Memphis suburb \u2014 voters banded together to pick the homegrown guy despite his Democratic label.\n\nIt didn\u2019t help that Davis had angered central district Republicans with his relentless, D.C.-funded attack ads against Tupelo\u2019s favorite GOP candidate and former mayor, Glenn McCullough Jr.\n\nAs soon as it had another viable Republican candidate, the district veered right again. They picked longtime Republican state Sen. Alan Nunnelee for the seat in 2010.\n\nWill they shake things up anew this year? Don\u2019t count on it.\n\nThirteen candidates are vying for the position left vacant in February when Nunnelee lost his battle to brain cancer. All but one \u2014 Walter Zinn Jr. of Pontotoc \u2014 are Republican. And while Zinn has the smarts and qualifications to lead the 1st District, he doesn\u2019t enjoy the same favorable circumstances that got Childers elected.\n\nIt\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess who among the 13 will win this year\u2019s race, but most bets are on a Republican.\n\n\u201cAs compared to the rest of the state, that area in particular does have a significant number of the remaining old-time Jamie Whitten Democrats \u2026, but those folks are in decline,\u201d said Marty Wiseman, former head of Mississippi State University\u2019s Stennis Institute of Government. \u201cIt\u2019s a Republican district like the rest of the red South. It\u2019s virtually hopeless for a Democrat, but not impossible.\u201d\n\nWhitten represented the 1st District for more than two decades, at a time when the entire state \u2014 the entire South \u2014 voted blue. In reality, though, Whitten had held power in the region since 1941, when it was still part of the 2nd District.\n\nWhen he retired in 1995, he did so as the then-longest serving representative in the nation.\n\n\u201cWhitten gave the region a political identity and a political unity,\u201d Grisham said. \u201cIt was very deliberate.\u201d\n\nThe region owes its success to a long parade of business leaders who partnered with Whitten and other members of the congressional delegation to bring home federal pork. Among the most memorable projects is the $2 billion Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway. But millions more dollars went to north Mississippi in the form of agriculture subsidies and highway project funds.\n\nWhitten had earned the title, King of Pork, which he shared with his congressional counterpart and fellow Democrat John Stennis.\n\nTheir ghosts would howl at the anti-pork rhetoric of their would-be successors, who at a recent debate in Tupelo denounced that type of \u201cwasteful\u201d Washington spending. They\u2019re all reading from the same GOP playbook, the one that derides Obamacare and limits the role of federal government.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re all saying the same thing,\u201d Wiseman said. \u201cThe only difference is the amount of emphasis they\u2019re putting on how conservative they are in hoping to top the others.\u201d\n\nWithout much else to differentiate the candidates, voters will rely on name recognition.\n\nCongressional hopeful Mike Tagert wins that contest, since he already represents the entire district as its transportation commissioner. But he faces competition from opponents spending hundreds of thousands of dollars to get their faces on TV.\n\nThose efforts might be too little too late for most voters.\n\n\u201cI have lived here 20 years, and I have no idea who most of the people are \u2014 and I pay attention to politics,\u201d said John M. Bruce, chairman of the University of Mississippi\u2019s Political Science Department. \u201cNot only is this election at the wrong time of the year, but there\u2019s a slew of candidates without political labels. From a political science standpoint, it\u2019s the worst time to have an election.\u201d\n\nBruce predicts low turnout comprised of voters loyal to one particular candidate. It\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess who will win the race.\n\n\u201cMy flip answer,\u201d he said, \u201cis that the winner will be whoever has the most friends.\u201d\n\nTHE 1ST DISTRICT\u2019S 2008 SPECIAL ELECTION\n\nJust a fraction of the nearly 575,000 voting-aged residents of Mississippi\u2019s 1st Congressional District cast ballots in the previous special election. Turnout could be equally low this time around.\n\nSpecial election results\n\nTravis Childers, Democrat \u2013 33,304\n\nGreg Davis, Republican \u2013 31,117\n\nSteve Holland, Democrat \u2013 789\n\nGlenn L.
