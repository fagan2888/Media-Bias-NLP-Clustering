Rick Scott vetoed nearly $57 million from the state\u2019s Health and Human Services budget Tuesday, including $9.25 million for biomedical research.\n\nScott\u2019s red pen cut $3 million earmarked for the Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute in Orlando's Lake Nona. Sanford-Burnham officials said the money was to fund the Florida Translational Research Program for another year.\n\nThe program provides Florida-based scientists access to professionals and state-of-the-art technological resources for drug discovery, said Patrick Bartosch, a spokesman for Sanford-Burnham. It\u2019s aimed at unmet medical needs, he said.\n\n\u201cThe (program) is an extremely successful program that has grown over three years, and researchers from universities and nonprofit institutes across the state have participated in it,\u201d Bartosch said in a statement. \u201cWe are currently evaluating what the governor\u2019s veto means for the FTRP and how to proceed.\u201d\n\nA total of $461 million was cut from the final $78 billion budget for the state on Tuesday. Scott said many of the projects he cut were either allocated in a non-competitive manner, or because the money was addressed elsewhere in the budget.\n\nIn his veto note, Scott said his health care budget was focused on access, quality and costs.\n\nThe vetoes related to health care totaling $1 million or more include:\n\n\u00b7 Florida State University Medical School, Facility for Rural and Underserved Areas: $3 million\n\n\u00b7 Intermediate Care Facilities for Developmentally Disabled rate increase: $3.9 million\n\n\u00b7 Florida Association of Free and Charitable Clinics, St. Petersburg: $9.5 million\n\n\u00b7 Florida State University Rural Primary Care Residency Program: $3 million\n\n\u00b7 Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute, Orlando: $3 million\n\n\u00b7 Torrey Pines Institute for Molecular Studies \u2013 Florida Drug Discovery Acceleration Program, Port St. Lucie: $2.5 million\n\n\u00b7 Scripps Research Institute, Jupiter: $1 million\n\n\u00b7 Vaccine and Gene Research Institute, Port St. Lucie: $2.5 million\n\n\u00b7 Miami Project to Cure Paralysis: $1 million\n\n\u00b7 All Children\u2019s Hospital Pediatric Research Zone, St. Petersburg: $2 million\n\nMary Shedden contributed to this report.
