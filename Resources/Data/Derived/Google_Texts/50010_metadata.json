No one expects accountability in this day and age and certainly not from Obama\u2019ites.\n\nMiller believes employees should no longer be cut based on seniority.\n\n\u201cThere are some people who think this is crap, fire a believer, they\u2019ll understand. Just say \u2018we\u2019re all in this together, this is what you wanted. I have to let you go, but at least you\u2019ll have health care in the single payer.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe went on to explain,\n\n\u201cfolks I\u2019m not saying that to be mean. That is how weird things have gotten where if you say that you\u2019re thought to be perverse or vindictive. Who else would you fire?Go out into the parking lot. If somebody has to be cut to 29 hours-if somebody has to be fired. You know how proud they are of their Obama-Biden bumper stickers in their original permutation. They\u2019re still on five years down the road.\u201d\n\nRational arguments are a specialty of Dennis Miller. He hits a home run here.\n\nPost navigation\n\n[poll id=\u201d128\u2033]", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "BizPac Review", "description": "Famed SNL star and radio personality Dennis Miller has a strong take on what should happen when Obamacare starts hurting businesses, according to an Oct. 17th radio broadcast of \u201cThe Dennis Miller Show.\u201d In the audio clip published by Media Matters, Miller said if someone has to be let go due to Obamacare, employers should \u2026", "title": "Dennis Miller to businesses: Fire Obama supporters, they'll understand", "locale": {"alternate": "en_US", "identifier": "en_US"}, "image": "http://www.bizpacreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Dennis-Miller-9542519-1-402.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-10-21T12:48:38+00:00", "url": "http://www.bizpacreview.com/2013/10/20/dennis-miller-to-businesses-fire-obama-supporters-theyll-understand-85580", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"widgets": {"csp": "on"}}, "alexaVerifyID": "qC73ojZoktel85cbl12SAFJar9k", "fb": {"admins": "10152426200106417,10152720237657852,10200650572686956,3854753687919,100215693385946,549853448412696", "pages": 169204449790211, "app_id": 1502886339979348}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ConservativeNewsToday", "section": "News", "published_time": "2013-10-20T09:41:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-21T12:48:38+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Miller said sarcastically, \u201cthey\u2019ll understand, they\u2019re patriots.\u201dThat part just doesn\u2019t seem plausible.\n\u201cThere are some people who think this is crap, fire a believer, they\u2019ll understand.\nThey\u2019re still on five years down the road.\u201dRational arguments are a specialty of Dennis Miller.\nThat is how weird things have gotten where if you say that you\u2019re thought to be perverse or vindictive.\nMiller believes employees should no longer be cut based on seniority."}
