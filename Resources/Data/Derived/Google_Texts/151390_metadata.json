Some 3,500 people have enrolled this year, she said.\n\n\"If you use a certain segment of physicians and hospitals, you have no copayment, no deductible, and there is no co-insurance,\" said Kendall, who said McLaren has partnered with four-hospital Oakwood Healthcare in Dearborn for its narrow network.\n\n\"You can also choose to use our (full) network of 33,000 physicians, hospitals and other providers and pay the normal deductible or copay,\" Kendall said.\n\nOfficials for Health Alliance Plan and Priority Health say they are not changing their commercial point-of-service plan strategies.\n\nScott Norman, Priority's vice president of sales and client services, said the Grand Rapids-based insurer is projecting increases in its point-of-service plans over the next several years because employers are looking for lower-cost options.\n\n\"Because of the (Affordable Care Act), PPO plans are seeing large rate increases,\" Norman said. \"POS plans are popular, especially in Southeast Michigan, because employers believe it is a most cost-effective way to continue to deliver benefits to employees.\"\n\nNorman said Priority has looked at offering a limited provider network as an option.\n\n\"The challenge with narrow networks is that it is a 'gotcha moment' for members,\" he said. \"The perception is they are buying something they don't understand.\"\n\nNorman said very few small-business clients have expressed interest in dropping their plans and moving to the public exchange.\n\n\"Almost 70 percent of clients are extending their current plan,\" Norman said. \"That has stunted the marketplace and private exchanges. ... The jury is still out about going to the exchange for small employers.\"\n\nKendall said another reason McLaren, which has about 144,000 members, eliminated its off-exchange POS plan is to cut losses.\n\nOver the past three years, McLaren Health Plan's profit dropped to a net loss of $172,000 last year from net income of $14.8 million in 2012 and $23.9 million in 2011, according to the Michigan Office of Financial and Insurance Services.\n\nDriving McLaren losses in 2013 was a $7.4 million hit on commercial business. McLaren lost $3.3 million in its new Medicare HMO plan but generated net income of $11 million on its Medicaid plan.\n\nKendall said McLaren expects to improve efficiency this year after it installs a new claims computer system, which will enable members, employers and providers to review claims online, saving staff time for other duties.\n\n\n\nJay Greene: (313) 446-0325, jgreene@crain.com.
