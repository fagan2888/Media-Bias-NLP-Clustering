The one-day, one-stop event gave Central Oregon\u2019s homeless and nearly so access to everything from hairdressers to veterinarians to dentists. Social service agencies were there, as were professionals who could vaccinate children or adults if need be.\n\nBut Project Connect was expensive, said Volunteer Connect Executive Director Betsy Warriner not long after the announcement was made, and attendance was down (from 3,421 in 2011 to 1,459 in 2014), while planning took up most of a year for those involved. Funding, which initially came from the Partnership to End Poverty, also grew more difficult to secure.\n\nA couple of things led to the decline in attendance, I suspect. Perhaps most important, Project Connect\u2019s early success was very much traceable to the recession that began in 2007. The first Project Connect was held in September of that year, when unemployment rates ran from 5.5 percent in Crook County to 5.7 percent in Jefferson County and 4.4 percent in Deschutes County.\n\nBy 2011, the event\u2019s biggest year, Crook County\u2019s unemployment rate was 19 percent, Jefferson\u2019s 13.6 percent and Deschutes\u2019 12.7 percent. In 2014, the event\u2019s last year, unemployment rates had fallen to 10.1 percent in Crook County, 10.8 percent in Jefferson and 7.9 percent in Deschutes. They\u2019re well below that now.\n\nMeanwhile, Warriner\u2019s agency turned the remaining Project Connect funds over to the nonprofit Icon City, which in a different fashion provides at least some of the services that had been available at the annual event.\n\nIcon City is probably best known for its shower truck, which can be found at Family Kitchen in downtown Bend on Tuesday and Wednesday, at Jericho Road in Redmond each Thursday and, in summer, at Drake Park. It also supplies food regularly and helps those in need find everything from bunk beds for new apartments to propane fuel for those who spend their winters in tents. It does all this with no paid staff and no formal fundraising, though it accepts donations on its website.\n\nAnd when Project Connect ended, it stepped in to take over some of the services that event offered. Its efforts, says Kenny LaPoint, one of Icon City\u2019s founders, have largely focused on medical and dental care, particularly the latter.\n\nWhile the Affordable Care Act makes it easier to get medical care these days, dental care is a different story. If you\u2019re homeless, a semiannual checkup is out of reach, so relatively inexpensive problems can grow to become serious health threats before they\u2019re dealt with. Thus Icon City has used a chunk of its Project Connect money to provide clients with dentures or extractions and implants \u2014 none of which comes cheap.\n\nWhat neither Icon City nor, to my knowledge, any other nonprofit in the area has stepped up to do is fill the need Project Connect\u2019s veterinarians used to meet each year, unfortunately. Those vets were in huge demand, too, providing routine checkups for upward of 700 animals in the event\u2019s peak year, including vaccinations. At the same time, as many as 70 cats and dogs \u2014 65 percent the latter \u2014 were spayed and neutered before day\u2019s end.\n\nGone, too, is the pet food handed out free of charge.\n\nI\u2019ll admit to being a softie about such things. My own belief system tells me we have a responsibility for our pets, who rely on us in a way people never will, and my own observation tells me homeless men and women often need their pets as much as or more than the rest of us do.\n\nJust as I think the rest of us should do what we can, individually and collectively, to help those in need, I think we should help assure that their animals get what they need as well. That can be difficult for those with housing but limited incomes; it can be nearly impossible if you\u2019re homeless.\n\n\u2014 Janet Stevens is deputy editor of The Bulletin.
