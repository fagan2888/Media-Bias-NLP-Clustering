He also pledged to seek about $1.5 million in increased annual funding for the Arkansas State Police Crimes Against Children Division to fund the hiring of eight additional hotline operators and supervisors and 16 additional investigators and supervisors.\n\nRoss announced his plan about a month and a half after his Republican opponent, Asa Hutchinson, also a former congressman, announced a plan to spend an additional $1 million a year to hire more probation and parole officers and an additional $300,000 a year to fund proven re-entry programs for convicts, among other things.\n\nAlso Tuesday, Ross proposed increasing the maximum sentences for certain violent crimes; increasing the maximum sentences for certain crimes for repeat offenders; adding representatives of law enforcement to the Arkansas Sentencing Commission; and encouraging Arkansas Community Correction\u2019s continued development of a system of pre-sentencing assessments to gauge offenders\u2019 risk of re-offending.\n\nRoss said that in just two counties, Union and Columbia, pre-sentencing assessments reduced prison admission rates and saved the state $4.2 million in 2011.\n\n\u201cIf you look at what this plan can do to save us, it probably \u2026 will actually save the state money,\u201d he said.\n\nRoss\u2019 plan also includes charging criminal defendants a $150 fee for each misdemeanor conviction and a $300 fee for each felony conviction to fund existing and new domestic violence shelters; creating a statewide database of protective orders; enhancing training for law enforcement officers on domestic violence; and requiring publication of a biennial report containing statistics on domestic violence in Arkansas.\n\n\u201cIn the last decade alone, Arkansas has frequently been ranked one of the 10 worst states in the nation when it comes to men killing women, a typical indicator of domestic homicide. We need to send a strong, clear message in this state that domestic violence will not be tolerated and we will do everything we can to protect and empower victims of domestic violence,\u201d Ross said.\n\nRoss said he developed his plan after consulting with law enforcement officers, prosecutors, public defenders, judges, policymakers and victim advocates.\n\nAsked to compare his plan to Hutchinson\u2019s, Ross said, \u201c(Hutchinson) threw a plan out there that I\u2019m not sure anybody in the law enforcement community took seriously. His answer to the parole and probation issue that we have in Arkansas, his answer to re-entry, was to invest an additional $5 per parolee in Arkansas. Really? That\u2019s not a serious crime-reduction plan.\u201d\n\nHutchinson said Tuesday in an email he is pleased that Ross \u201cfollowed my lead and offered support for many of the same points in my plan,\u201d including giving more tools to prosecutors, adding parole officers, and funding re-entry programs and drug courts.\n\n\u201cThe clear difference is experience and leadership. I bring to this challenge my experience in law enforcement and as a former federal prosecutor,\u201d said Hutchinson, who has served as director of the federal Drug Enforcement Administration and as U.S. attorney in Fort Smith.\n\nHutchinson said it is \u201cdisappointing that (Ross) arrogantly mocks my plan\u201d to do many of the same things Ross proposed.\n\n\u201cHe likes to be on both sides of the issue whether it is the Affordable Care Act; or gun control; or voting for (House Minority Leader) Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif). This is just another example,\u201d Hutchinson said.\n\nRoss and Hutchinson also will face Libertarian candidate Frank Gilbert and Green Party candidate Joshua Drake in the Nov. 4 general election.", "article_metadata": {"description": "LITTLE ROCK \u2014 Democratic candidate for governor Mike Ross on Tuesday unveiled a plan to spend an additional $10 million a year on efforts to reduce violent crime and prison overcrowding.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "John Lyon Arkansas News Bureau jlyon@arkansasnews.com", "og": {"site_name": "Arkansas News", "description": "LITTLE ROCK \u2014 Democratic candidate for governor Mike Ross on Tuesday unveiled a plan to spend an additional $10 million a year on efforts to reduce violent crime and prison overcrowding.", "title": "Ross unveils plan to address crime, prison overcrowding", "url": "http://arkansasnews.com/news/arkansas/ross-unveils-plan-address-crime-prison-overcrowding", "image": "http://arkansasnews.com/sites/arkansasnews.com/files/field/media/web1_mike-ross_7.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://arkansasnews.com/news/arkansas/ross-unveils-plan-address-crime-prison-overcrowding", "image": {"src": "http://arkansasnews.com/sites/arkansasnews.com/files/field/media/web1_mike-ross_7.jpg"}, "creator": "@arkansasnews", "card": "summary", "title": "Ross unveils plan to address crime, prison overcrowding"}, "keywords": "Arkansas,News,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-15T13:56:55-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9d2a\"", "article_summary": "We need to send a strong, clear message in this state that domestic violence will not be tolerated and we will do everything we can to protect and empower victims of domestic violence,\u201d Ross said.\nRoss said he developed his plan after consulting with law enforcement officers, prosecutors, public defenders, judges, policymakers and victim advocates.\nHutchinson said it is \u201cdisappointing that (Ross) arrogantly mocks my plan\u201d to do many of the same things Ross proposed.\nLITTLE ROCK \u2014 Democratic candidate for governor Mike Ross on Tuesday unveiled a plan to spend an additional $10 million a year on efforts to reduce violent crime and prison overcrowding.\nRoss proposed spending $8.5 million a year to hire about 200 additional probation and parole officers and support alternative sentencing, drug courts and re-entry programs."}
