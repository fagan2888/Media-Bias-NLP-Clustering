So, his presidency is useful after all, because it illustrates the perils of government run by believers in magic words and numbers.\n\nThe last progressive president promised Model Cities, with every child enjoying a Head Start en route to enjoying an Upward Bound into a Great Society. Today\u2019s progressive president also uses words \u2014 and numbers \u2014 magically emancipated from reality.\n\nThirty months have passed since Obama said: \u201cThe time has come for President Assad to step aside.\u201d Today, James Clapper, director of national intelligence, says Bashar al-Assad\u2019s grip on power has \u201cstrengthened.\u201d In last month\u2019s State of the Union address, Obama defined success down by changing the subject: \u201cAmerican diplomacy, backed by the threat of force, is why Syria\u2019s chemical weapons are being eliminated.\u201d If saying so makes it so, all is well.\n\nAssad, however, seems tardy regarding this elimination, perhaps because the threat of force was never actually made. The Democratic-controlled Senate nullified the threat by its emphatic reluctance to authorize force. Reuters recently reported that Assad had surrendered \u201c4.1 percent of the roughly 1,300 tonnes of toxic agents\u201d he supposedly has. The \u201c.1\u201d is an especially magical number, given the modifier \u201croughly\u201d attached to 1,300 tons.\n\nThe English Civil War was not finally ended by negotiations between Oliver Cromwell and Charles I; Cromwell seized power and Charles lost his head. America\u2019s Civil War ended when Robert E. Lee capitulated to U.S. (\u201cUnconditional Surrender\u201d) Grant. Russia\u2019s civil war ended when Leon Trotsky\u2019s Red Army defeated the White forces. Spain\u2019s civil war ended with Francisco Franco in Madrid and remnants of the loyalist forces straggling across the Pyrenees into France. China\u2019s civil war ended when Chiang Kai-shek skedaddled to Formosa (now Taiwan), leaving the mainland to Mao. But Syria\u2019s civil war \u2014 after the massacres, torture, chemical weapons \u2014 supposedly will be resolved by a negotiated regime change: with words. Next, words will supposedly result in Iran ending the decades-old and hugely expensive nuclear weapons program that it says is nonexistent, and will proceed.\n\n1 of 8 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 What Obama didn\u2019t know View Photos The many controversies that the White House says the president was kept in the dark about.

Thousands who had bought insurance have been receiving cancellations notices from insurers. The president said he wasn\u2019t aware his promise before the rollout would result in cancellations, and Obama had repeatedly stated that, although new health-care insurance would be available through the Affordable Care Act, those willing to stay on their plan would be able to do so.In fact, that wasn\u2019t the case.

Seven dollars is the figure, plucked from the ether, that Obama says will be saved by every dollar spent on \u201chigh quality\u201d universal preschool, which is probably defined, with tidy circularity, as preschool that saves seven dollars for every dollar spent on it.\n\nForests continue to be felled to produce the paper on which are printed the continuing studies demonstrating that the United States, which has more than 2 million miles of natural gas pipelines and about 175,000 miles of hazardous-liquid pipelines, would not be menaced by the 1,179 miles of Keystone XL. The new State Department study says construction \u201cwould support approximately 42,100 jobs (direct, indirect, and induced).\u201d Obama, of course, has his own number. In a July 24, 2013, interview with the New York Times, he said construction \u201cmight create maybe 2,000 jobs.\u201d\n\nThe workforce participation rate is at a 36-year low; in the second half of the fifth year of the recovery, a smaller fraction of the population is employed or looking for work than was when the recovery began. Nevertheless, the administration is cheerful about the Congressional Budget Office\u2019s conclusion that the Affordable Care Act (ACA) will substantially slow the growth of employment and compensation over the next decade.\n\nThe decrease is projected to be nearly three times larger than the CBO had previously predicted. The ACA\u2019s insurance subsidies, which decline with rising income and increase with falling income, will cause many people to choose to stop working, or to work less, or to stop looking for work, thereby reducing the number of hours worked by the equivalent of 2.3 million full-time jobs by 2021.\n\nAn administration spokesman did not dispute the CBO\u2019s key finding but hailed it as evidence that the ACA is increasing Americans\u2019 choices. Really.\n\nMany of the words and numbers bandied by Obama and his administration may reflect an honest belief that the world is whatever well-intentioned people like them say about it. So, Obama\u2019s critics should reconsider their assumption that he is cynical. It is his sincerity that is scary.\n\nRead more from George F.
