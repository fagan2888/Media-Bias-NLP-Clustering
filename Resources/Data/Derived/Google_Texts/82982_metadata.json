If you answered ObamaCare, you\u2019re wrong. The biggest trend is the rapid growth in private Health Savings Account plans.\n\nHSAs let people buy high-deductible insurance and put pretax dollars into savings accounts to cover \u2014 tax-free \u2014 out-of-pocket costs. Extra funds are rolled over. The accounts are portable.\n\nFor years, conservatives championed HSAs as market-based health reform that gives consumers more control of their health care and their spending.\n\nDemocrats, naturally, hated the idea, claiming that HSAs would appeal only to the young and healthy, would destabilize the insurance market and wouldn\u2019t hold down health costs. Ted Kennedy, for instance, dismissed them as \u201can untried, untested, expensive system that could provide billions of dollars of benefits to wealthy individuals and insurance companies.\u201d\n\nRepublicans were finally able to overcome this intense opposition, authorizing HSAs in 2004. They\u2019ve proved a big hit ever since.\n\nAccording to America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, nearly 17.4 million people are in HSAs today, up 12% from last year and more than double the number in 2009.\n\nAnd none of the Democrats\u2019 attacks proved true.\n\nFar from destabilizing the insurance market, premium growth slowed as HSAs grew. And now they\u2019re helping slow the growth of health costs.\n\nThe Kaiser Family Foundation estimates that these plans account for a quarter of the recent health-spending slowdown. And the Rand Corp. says a 50% HSA market share would slash health costs by $57 billion a year.\n\nUnfortunately, ObamaCare may be thwarting this healthy trend. Individual and small-group enrollment has dropped in the past two years, just as ObamaCare\u2019s onerous insurance rules kicked in. While large-group HSA plans are still growing, ObamaCare\u2019s market distortions might put an end to that, too.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Free Enterprise: What's the biggest health reform sweeping the country today?
