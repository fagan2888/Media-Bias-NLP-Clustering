She recently posted the following on her blog:\n\n\u201cOne of my security detail, Dominic Arena, recently purchased a DJI Phantom flying camera. These drone-like, radio controlled aircraft are lots of fun to play with and they take extraordinary photos. However, controlling them takes practice and getting used to. Since my farm has lots of open fields, Dominic thought it would be the best place to get acquainted with his new toy. The results were amazing!\u201d\n\nOn Twitter, she offered more thoughts on unmanned aircraft:\n\n#the martha blog has amazing photos of my farm taken by a drone! We love the possibilities and opportunities drones offer. Do you? \u2014 Martha Stewart (@MarthaStewart) July 9, 2014\n\nhttp://t.co/b2YyxhGHbK was a huge hit today- displaying photos of my farm taken by a DRONE! controversial but fabulous, drones do a good job \u2014 Martha Stewart (@MarthaStewart) July 10, 2014\n\nTo dedicated Martha watchers, her drone allegiance is old news. Rich McCormick of The Verge notes that she was already talking up the technology to Vanity Fair back in May. At an Herm\u00e8s event (during which she also rode on a mechanical horse), she told the magazine that her drone \u201cflies all over my farm and takes pictures\u201d and that \u201cyou can use it inside also, but I don\u2019t, because it can bang into stuff.\u201d Asked if the drone ever frightened her neighbors, she laughed and said: \u201cNo. I don\u2019t have any neighbors.\u201d\n\nAlso in May, Alyssa Bereznak of Yahoo noticed a mention of the Parrot AR.Drone 2.0 Power Edition in Martha Stewart Living. Ms. Stewart wrote therein:\n\n\u201cParrot, a French company, makes fantastic high-tech products, like this remote-control drone, or quadricopter. It takes photos and even high-definition video. I operate it from my iPad and can send it out over the farm \u2014 I love getting overhead shots of the gardens and livestock.\u201d\n\nThis is a different drone from the DJI Phantom Ms. Stewart praised last week \u2014 comparing the two at The Verge, Mr. McCormick points out that the Phantom is \u201cmore advanced.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how Ms. Stewart\u2019s livestock feel about their continuing aerial surveillance, but others have some concerns. At The Washington Post, Caitlin Dewey writes:\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something a little jarring about hearing a drone endorsement from Stewart, a lady best-known for her embrace of all things fussy, florid and otherwise unmodern. It\u2019s not a breakthrough moment for the technology, exactly \u2014 but it\u2019s certainly a glimpse at how mainstream America might use it.\u201d\n\nAnd at Time, Medea Benjamin, a cofounder of the peace advocacy group Codepink, writes that many drone companies are in the process of rebranding, publicizing the more peaceable uses of their products and even moving away from the word \u201cdrone.\u201d But, she argues, this shouldn\u2019t distract us from the necessity of regulating the technology: \u201cNot even Martha Stewart can sweep aside the important ethical and legal issues that have arisen with President Obama\u2019s killer drones, or the deployment of autonomous drones or the coming use of domestic spy drones.\u201d She says Codepink has tried to work with drone manufacturers on regulation to little avail and concludes: \u201cRather than ignoring or white-washing the problematic nature of killer drones, spy drones and autonomous killer robots, the industry \u2014 and drone enthusiasts \u2014 should work with the human rights and peace communities to distinguish between good, the bad and the ugly.\u201d\n\n\n\nOthers, however, have focused on how drone use will fit into Ms. Stewart\u2019s already-crowded technological life. In May, Ms. Bereznak cited an earlier episode when Ms. Stewart repeatedly tweeted about her broken iPad, apparently hoping that an Apple technician would come to her home and fix it. \u201cIf how she dealt with that situation is any indicator of her ability to operate a drone,\u201d wrote Ms. Bereznak, \u201cmay god have mercy on us all.\u201d\n\nAnd Sage Lazzaro of Betabeat reminded readers of Ms. Stewart\u2019s penchant for tweeting pictures of gloppy food: \u201cYour drone pics are alright, but sorry, we\u2019re still not excited about your infamously horrific food photos.\u201d\n\nPerhaps in future Ms. Stewart\u2019s food pictures will be taken by drone.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20140715114845, "BN": "op-talk", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/optalk", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/op-talk/post", "DISPLAYDATE": "July 15, 2014", "keywords": "Deeper Dive", "GBLC": "Deeper Dive", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/op-talk/What Happened When Martha Stewart Got a Drone  ( 20140715 )", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Anna North", "SCG": "op-talk", "sourceApp": "blogs", "CLMST": "Anna North", "byl": "Anna North", "twitter": {"description": "The lifestyle mogul\u2019s enthusiasm for unmanned aircraft is not shared by everyone.", "title": "What Happened When Martha Stewart Got a Drone", "url": "http://op-talk.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/07/15/what-happened-when-martha-stewart-got-a-drone/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "site": "@nytopinion", "card": "summary"}, "blogpostid": 100000003001356, "description": "The lifestyle mogul\u2019s enthusiasm for unmanned aircraft is not shared by everyone.", "CG": "Opinion", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "July 15, 2014", "article": {"section": "Opinion", "tag": "Deeper Dive", "published_time": 1405439325, "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "modified_time": "2014-07-15T15:48:45-04:00"}, "utime": 20140715154845, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20140715, "pdate": 20140715, "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "Op-Talk", "description": "The lifestyle mogul\u2019s enthusiasm for unmanned aircraft is not shared by everyone.", "title": "What Happened When Martha Stewart Got a Drone", "url": "http://op-talk.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/07/15/what-happened-when-martha-stewart-got-a-drone/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://op-talk.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/07/15/what-happened-when-martha-stewart-got-a-drone/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "What Happened When Martha Stewart Got a Drone", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "article_summary": "controversial but fabulous, drones do a good job \u2014 Martha Stewart (@MarthaStewart) July 10, 2014To dedicated Martha watchers, her drone allegiance is old news.\n\u2014 Martha Stewart (@MarthaStewart) July 9, 2014http://t.co/b2YyxhGHbK was a huge hit today- displaying photos of my farm taken by a DRONE!\nI don\u2019t have any neighbors.\u201dAlso in May, Alyssa Bereznak of Yahoo noticed a mention of the Parrot AR.Drone 2.0 Power Edition in Martha Stewart Living.\nMs. Stewart wrote therein:\u201cParrot, a French company, makes fantastic high-tech products, like this remote-control drone, or quadricopter.\nPhotoIf you have lingering questions about drones \u2014 particularly about whether they can take nice pictures of a farm \u2014 allow Martha Stewart to reassure you."}
