Associated Press\n\nThe Japanese government posted two archives online Friday that it says bolster its case for sovereignty over islands also claimed by China and South Korea.\n\nThe documents, images and other records were originally held by local governments, some which were not previously available to the public, according to the Office of Policy Planning and Coordination on Territory and Sovereignty. About 100 support Japan\u2019s case that that Liancourt Rocks, known as Takeshima in Japanese, belong to Japan, the office said. The islands are administered by South Korea, which refers to them as Dokdo.\n\nAnother 100 items are evidence of Japan\u2019s rights to uninhabited islands in the East China Sea known as the Senkakus in Japan and the Diaoyu in China, the office said. China also claims sovereignty over the islands.\n\n\u201cThe database was created to show that Japan\u2019s claim is based on objective facts,\u201d a government official told Japan Real Time.\n\nItems include a document from 1903 showing records of Japanese fishermen hunting sea lions on the Liancourt Rocks, and Okinawa prefecture records from 1890 on the state of fishery at the Senkakus/Diaoyu. The office said it is to translate parts of the database into English, and may also prepare Korean and Chinese versions.\n\nTokyo has said the two territories are \u201cindisputably an inherent part of the territory of Japan in light of historical facts and based upon international law.\u201d South Korea has said on its own website that the Liancourt Rocks are \u201can integral part of Korea\u2019s territory historically, geographically and under international law,\u201d offering its own evidence.\n\nChina also calls the Senkakus/Diaoyu \u201can inherent territory of China,\u201d with the government saying there are clear historical and legal grounds supporting China\u2019s claim to sovereignty.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "The Japanese government posted two archives online Friday that it says bolster its case for sovereignty over islands also claimed by China and South Korea.", "title": "Japan Offers Archival Evidence in Island Territorial Disputes", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/japanrealtime/2015/08/28/japan-offers-archival-evidence-in-island-territorial-disputes/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KB161_jislan_P_20150828022510.jpg"}, "site": "wsjasia", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "World", "article.headline": "Japan Offers Archival Evidence in Island Territorial Disputes", "description": "The Japanese government posted two archives online Friday that it says bolster its case for sovereignty over islands also claimed by China and South Korea.", "article_section": "World", "author": "Jun Hongo", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Japan Real Time Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Japan Real Time", "article.summary": "The Japanese government posted two archives online Friday that it says bolster its case for sovereignty over islands also claimed by China and South Korea.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2015-08-28T07:20:39-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-138", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/japanrealtime/2015/08/28/japan-offers-archival-evidence-in-island-territorial-disputes/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-JRTB-20695", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "World", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "The Japanese government posted two archives online Friday that it says bolster its case for sovereignty over islands also claimed by China and South Korea.", "title": "Japan Offers Archival Evidence in Island Territorial Disputes", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/japanrealtime/2015/08/28/japan-offers-archival-evidence-in-island-territorial-disputes/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KB161_jislan_P_20150828022510.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Japan Real Time", "article.id": "BL-JRTB-20695", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-08-28T07:45:46-04:00"}, "article_summary": "An aerial view of the Liancourt Rocks, called Takeshima in Japan and Dokdo in South Korea.\nAbout 100 support Japan\u2019s case that that Liancourt Rocks, known as Takeshima in Japanese, belong to Japan, the office said.\nThe islands are administered by South Korea, which refers to them as Dokdo.\nAssociated PressThe Japanese government posted two archives online Friday that it says bolster its case for sovereignty over islands also claimed by China and South Korea.\nAnother 100 items are evidence of Japan\u2019s rights to uninhabited islands in the East China Sea known as the Senkakus in Japan and the Diaoyu in China, the office said."}
