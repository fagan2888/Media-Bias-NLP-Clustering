The two brothers from North Carolina are the subjects of a documentary called \"Woodhouse Divided\" about politics and family dynamics.\n\nCSPAN said they had no notice Joyce Woodhouse would call during Tuesday's program and Brad and Dallas appeared to be surprised as well.\n\nThe story and video have already made the rounds of many news outlets and blogs that cover North Carolina politics. To my knowledge, the Woodhouses have no particular connection to Western North Carolina, but the video is still fun to watch.
