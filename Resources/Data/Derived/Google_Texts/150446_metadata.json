He said the next president will need to be someone who will make big changes in DC and that he thinks it should be a governor. He said he has been praying about his decision, but on top of that he\u2019s been focused on what he would do if placed in that position so he\u2019s been busy working on policy statements through his non-profit America Next.\n\nJindal was comfortable and well versed in discussing a variety of topics. Education policy is quick becoming one of his wheelhouse issues as he has been front and center in the battle against Common Core. In Iowa, as Jindal arrived in the state, Common Core ads were being run touting the math and English language arts standards as \u201cconservative.\u201d Jindal said he disagreed with that description, but it is a debate worth having.\n\n\u201cWe are going to fight Common Core with everything we\u2019ve got in Louisiana.\u201d Jindal said. \u201cWe are in federal court against Arne Duncan. We in our state legislature, when it comes into session in April, we are going to pass legislation where we get rid of Common Core.\u201d\n\nHe also dismissed the notion that Common Core doesn\u2019t impact textbooks or classroom discussion. \u201cThe standards determine what is tested. The tests determine what is taught which determines the curriculum,\u201d Jindal stated.\n\nJindal told Caffeinated Thoughts that he wants to shrink the U.S. Department of Education by getting rid of many of its programs and then block grant those dollars to the states. He said the Department should only be focused on transparency, deregulation and civil rights. Everything else he said should be left to locals. \u201cLet\u2019s trust parents,\u201d he added.\n\nHe also encouraged those who on the fence to consider why people are opposed. He shared during our discussion and in previous ones we\u2019ve had struggles his own kids have had with the math. He said the problems go beyond just philosophical concerns.\n\n\u201cLook at the actual standards. Look at the move away from Euclidean geometry. Look at the deemphasis on getting the right answers at an earlier grade. Look at the move away from the classic texts in the ELA. There are a lot of content specific issues with this,\u201d Jindal noted.\n\nHe also noted that the current trends from Common Core proponents ignore the basic reason for public education.\n\n\u201cThe reason we pay for public education, the fundamental reason we have education is we want a self-governing society. We want citizens who can make critical decisions for themselves and for others when they vote in elections, when they train the next generation of leaders,\u201d Jindal shared. \u201cHistorically you track the reasons why in this country we fund public education is to train the next citizens, the next generation, in critical thinking to have a self-governing republic.\u201d\n\nJindal called No Child Behind an \u201cawful mistake.\u201d He believes that reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act needs to happen so No Child Left Behind doesn\u2019t continue to exist in perpetuity. He said he doesn\u2019t favor tweaks or status quo.\n\nHe stated that our Founding Fathers never intended for the Federal government to be involved in local education. \u201cInstead of being cheaper Democrats, lets shrink the size of the Federal Department of Education. Remove the power of discretionary spending so no future Secretary can abuse that,\u201d Jindal said. \u201cWe miss a great opportunity if all we do is tinker around the edges.\u201d\n\nJindal currently has a Republican state legislator calling his approach to state budgeting \u201cinsane.\u201d Jindal said the issue is that he kept his campaign pledge to cut spending and not raise taxes.\n\n\u201cOf course I\u2019m going to keep my pledge. My pledge means something. When I told voters \u2013 I wasn\u2019t secretive about this. I wasn\u2019t ambiguous about this. I was very clear. We are not raising taxes,\u201d he asserted.\n\nHe highlighted Louisiana\u2019s economic record. \u201cI am proud we have shrunk, we have reduced the size of our budget by nine billion dollars \u2013 26%. We have cut over 30,000 state government jobs. As a result our state private sector economy is growing,\u201d Jindal stated.\n\n\u201cOur economy is growing twice as fast as the national economy, private sector jobs nearly three times as fast. We are a top-five state when it comes to private sector job creation,\u201d he added.\n\nJindal stated this was done through making government do more with less. He indicated the work is not done. He also added that his administration is trying to get rid of half a billion of dollars in corporate welfare and shrink the state\u2019s budget by another billion dollars.\n\nHe\u2019s tired of politicians not living up to their promises, including ones in his own party.\n\n\u201cYou are going to have politicians \u2013 both Republicans and Democrats who think the easy way out is to just raise taxes. We have had enough of that, and I think that voters are tired of candidates who say one thing and do another to get elected,\u201d Jindal stated. \u201cIn DC \u2013 18 trillion dollars in debt \u2013 wouldn\u2019t it be nice if we actually had Republicans who would tell us that we are going to shrink the size of government, not just slow down the growth.\u201d\n\nHe dinged Republican Congressional leadership.\n\n\u201cOne of the things I think is so frustrating is when candidates promise one thing and do another so now we got leadership in DC that tells us, \u2018hey we are not really serious about repealing Obamacare.\u2019 They just gave up on amnesty. They told us when they were campaigning \u2018give us the majority\u2019 when they campaigned in red, blue and purple states and they won a majority. I don\u2019t remember the fine language in the ad that said \u2018we are not serious\u2019 or \u2018just repeal the easy parts\u2019 or \u2018just repeal part of it,'\u201d Jindal exclaimed.\n\nHe said it took liberals since 1993 to take over the healthcare system. He wished Republicans would fight with as much tenacity.\n\n\u201cI disagree with the entirety of Obamacare. The entire thing needs to be repealed and replaced, but you have to admire (Democrats\u2019) tenacity. They did whatever it took to fight to take away our freedom. I want our side to fight just as hard to restore our freedom. They don\u2019t even seem willing to try,\u201d Jindal said. \u201cRepublicans need to pass an Obamacare replacement today and it better not be Obamacare light.\u201d\n\nIf Republicans don\u2019t follow through on this Jindal is afraid there will be a voter backlash in upcoming elections.\n\nWhile the country may be experiencing a recovery, voters have not felt it with their wallets. Jindal noted that to address wage stagnation there needs to be some policy changes in DC. He noted the repeal of Obamacare and then regulations need to be reigned in. He said their needs to be a push toward domestic energy production to bring good paying energy sector jobs which will require technical training. He said there needs to be real educational choice and reform, and real tax reform that cuts out corporate loopholes.\n\nHe noted the problem with our current monetary policy.\n\n\u201cOver 18 trillion dollars in borrowing with artificially low interest rates because of Fed policies. At some point, and it is not predictable when and nobody can tell you exactly when it is going to happen, at some point this is going to catch up with us. You can\u2019t keep borrowing and printing money like this forever. What I worry about is that you can see a very significantly weaker dollar, you can see very high rates of inflation and the only choice the government has in that scenario is to rapidly increase interest rates,\u201d Jindal noted.\n\n\u201cNow a lot of people are too young to remember the stagflation of the 70s and how hard it was when Reagan came in to break the back of inflation and how hard it was with the high interest rates and what that did to the economy in the short term,\u201d Jindal added. \u201cHe did what he felt was necessary to grow the economy again. We are living on borrowed time. Whether you are an economic expert in economics or not, it is pretty simple. You can\u2019t keep living beyond your means. You can\u2019t just keep assuming that other countries will buy our debt. You can\u2019t assume that it is inevitable that the dollar is going to be the global reserve currency. You can\u2019t assume this is sustainable.\u201d\n\nHe said that leadership in DC is needed who will reduce the size of government, cut spending, balance the budget and start paying off the debt.\n\n\u201cWe need a stronger dollar. We need a sustainable monetary policy. We don\u2019t have that today and my concern is that this President has never even proposed to balance the budget at any point. He does ten-year projections and at no point does it ever balance. They continue to kick the can down the road and the problem is only going to get worse, not better,\u201d Jindal stated.\n\nJindal notes that a Republican majority is not enough as our current Congress has shown. Structural changes are needed. He touted a balanced budget amendment, term limits, prohibiting members of Congress from becoming lobbyists, and amending the Constitution so that a supermajority vote is needed to grow the budget faster than the economy and increase taxes.\n\nCaffeinated Thoughts as a final question asked about Iran.\n\n\u201cEveryone who is running in 2016 needs to make it very clear to the Iranian regime tha tthey are negotiating with a lame-duck president and if this agreement is not sent to the Senate and Congress for ratification and approval it is not binding on the successor,\u201d Jindal stated.\n\nJindal endorsed the \u201copen letter\u201d to the Iranian leadership that U.S. Senator Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas) wrote that most of the Republican Senate caucus signed onto. In a released statement earlier this week Jindal called on all Republican candidates to do the same.\n\nHe said without legislative approval at most President Obama\u2019s deal with the Iranians is a two-year deal, not a ten-year deal or longer. \u201cI\u2019m very worried this President prefers a bad deal over no deal,\u201d Jindal said.\n\n\u201cA nuclear-armed Iran is an existential threat to Israel, to our European allies, and to the United States. After Iran you\u2019ll see Egypt, Turkey and Saudia Arabia all want nuclear capabilities. Some of those countries already have the ability to buy that capability from Pakistan. You will have multiple countries in the Middle East who have nuclear capabilities. Think about how dangerous that is for the world,\u201d Jindal added.\n\n\u201cThe real enemy is radical Islamic terrorists\u2026 and a nuclear armed Iran,\u201d Jindal stated.\n\nHe said Congress needs to pass a bill that requires the Iran deal to come to Congress for approval and then pass additional sanctions.\n\n\u201cThis is the first Commander-in-Chief who said \u2018I don\u2019t want more leverage at the table. I don\u2019t want any more power to negotiate,'\u201d Jindal said. \u201cNow think about that if you are ever in a business deal you always want to be across the table from someone who needs the deal more than you do.\u201d\n\nHe noted that President Obama\u2019s attitude toward Iran has \u201cinfected\u201d his entire foreign policy and he has not received anything in return.\n\n\u201cSo Iran has not reversed their hostile attitudes toward Israel. They continue to be hostile toward the United States.\u201d Jindal observed.\n\nHe said the administration\u2019s hostility is misplaced. He needs to be more assertive with Iran and stop criticizing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and denigrating United States Senators.\n\nYou can watch the whole video of our exclusive interview here or below:", "article_metadata": {"shareaholic": {"site_name": "Caffeinated Thoughts", "language": "en-US", "url": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/2015/03/bobby-jindal-focused-on-policy-as-he-considers-2016/", "article_author_name": "Shane Vander Hart", "image": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Bobby-Jindal-Interview-1024x577.png", "site_id": "965f58835b5900850067f65116487024", "article_published_time": "2015-03-12T18:42:47+00:00", "shareable_page": "true", "article_modified_time": "2016-05-26T05:30:14+00:00", "keywords": "2016, barack obama, bobby jindal, campaign promises, common core, elementary and secondary education act, foreign policy, iowa caucus, iran, national debt, no child left behind, obamacare, value of the dollar, election central", "wp_version": "7.7.1.0"}, "description": "Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal is focused on policy and discusses education, economic, monetary and foreign policy with Caffeinated Thoughts this week.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Caffeinated Thoughts", "description": "Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal is focused on policy and discusses education, economic, monetary and foreign policy with Caffeinated Thoughts this week.", "title": "Bobby Jindal Focused on Policy As He Considers 2016 | Caffeinated Thoughts", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Bobby-Jindal-Interview-1024x577.png", "url": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/2015/03/bobby-jindal-focused-on-policy-as-he-considers-2016/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal is focused on policy and discusses education, economic, monetary and foreign policy with Caffeinated Thoughts this week.", "creator": "@shanevanderhart", "image": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Bobby-Jindal-Interview.png", "title": "Bobby Jindal Focused on Policy As He Considers 2016 | Caffeinated Thoughts", "site": "@CaffThoughts", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 259594777484510}, "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/CaffThoughts", "section": "Election Central", "tag": "Value of the Dollar", "published_time": "2015-03-12T13:42:47-05:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/shanevanderhart"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5629\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe real enemy is radical Islamic terrorists\u2026 and a nuclear armed Iran,\u201d Jindal stated.\nThey continue to be hostile toward the United States.\u201d Jindal observed.\n\u201cI\u2019m very worried this President prefers a bad deal over no deal,\u201d Jindal said.\nHe said Congress needs to pass a bill that requires the Iran deal to come to Congress for approval and then pass additional sanctions.\n(Des Moines, IA) Governor Bobby Jindal (R-Louisiana) in an exclusive interview with Caffeinated Thoughts said that he was just two months away from making a decision about 2016."}
