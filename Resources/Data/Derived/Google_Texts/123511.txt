Vice President Biden is returning to Washington, D.C., on Wednesday after spending the past week with family in Delaware following the funeral for his son, Beau Biden.

Biden will attend meetings at the White House in the morning and have lunch with President Obama at the president's private dining room in the afternoon.

The vice president will then meet with Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk at the White House, before returning to Delaware later in the day.

ADVERTISEMENT The White House has faced pressure to supply offensive weapons to Ukraine, which it has repeatedly said it would not do, fearing further escalation with Russia.

Obama discussed continued support of economic sanctions against Russia during a meeting with French President Francois Hollande on Monday at the G-7 summit in Germany.

Lawmakers from across the political spectrum attended Beau Biden's funeral Saturday in Wilmington, Del. He died May 30 at the age of 46 after a two-year battle with brain cancer.

Beau Biden, Delaware's attorney general until early this year, was reportedly mulling a 2016 gubernatorial bid.

In a tweet Monday, Biden's family offered their thanks for the outpouring of support:

Our deepest gratitude for everyone's kindness & compassion. Your love & admiration for Beau has touched us beyond measure. -The Biden Family â€” Vice President Biden (@VP) June 8, 2015

The vice president briefly returned to Washington last week for his granddaughter's middle school graduation, per The Associated Press.

After their lunch, Obama will meet with Defense Secretary Ashton Carter to discuss the administration's ongoing strategy to defeat Islamic militants in the Middle East.
