It also was so emphatic, she recalled this week, \u201cYou could actually see it beat through my shirt.\u201d\n\nShe told her mother, Debra, about it, asking, \u201cIs this normal?\u201d\n\nNo, a concerned Debra said, it isn\u2019t. She took Kelsey to the family physician, seeking answers. Soon, Kelsey was found to be afflicted with the rare Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome, meaning she had an extra electrical pathway in her heart. After referrals to Children\u2019s Hospital, she underwent two separate operations a month apart.\n\nThe first, an attempted freezing of the pathway to shut it down, was the less radical of the two possible solutions, but it didn\u2019t work. The second, more risky, involved \u201cburning\u201d the pathway.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t want to burn it the first time because there could be scabs and create a clot and more issues,\u201d Snider said. \u201cBut they had to do that.\u201d\n\nShe smiled and added, \u201cIt worked. \u2026 I\u2019m good now!\u201d\n\nYes, years later, the Pomona High graduate is a senior leader and middle blocker for CSU\u2019s five-time defending Mountain West champions. The Rams are 10-1 and ranked eighth in the country after Friday night\u2019s victory over No. 18 Arizona State in Tempe, Ariz. CSU plays Saturday against Pepperdine at 11 a.m. and North Carolina Central at 6 p.m. in Tempe.\n\nSnider, 22, was named the conference player of the week Monday after she helped the Rams win four consecutive matches, including a victory over No. 9 Brigham Young in Las Cruces, N.M.\n\nThe current national ranking is the highest for the program since 2004. Although the Rams have made the NCAA Tournament in each of coach Tom Hilbert\u2019s 17 seasons with the Rams, and have made game nights a campus happening at Moby Arena, the farthest they\u2019ve gotten is the regional semifinals, or the Sweet 16. They\u2019ve done that five times.\n\n\u201cEvery year I\u2019ve been here, we only made it to the first or second round,\u201d said the 6-foot-1 Snider. \u201cThis is my last year here, and I want to make it farther. I want to be part of the team that goes to the Sweet 16 and Elite Eight. Final Four would be a dream.\u201d\n\nThe funny thing is, Snider at first didn\u2019t even like the sport.\n\n\u201cFreshman year of high school I wanted to be a three-sport athlete,\u201d Snider said. \u201cI said I was going to do basketball, track and soccer. Well, track and soccer were in the same season, so I said, \u2018All right, well, let\u2019s try volleyball.\u2019\n\n\u201cOn the second day of tryouts, I was saying, \u2018I don\u2019t like this. I\u2019m going to quit. This is horrible. I don\u2019t understand it.\u2019 My dad was like, \u2018Kels, you can\u2019t quit. You\u2019re not a quitter.\u2019 \u201c\n\nShe stuck with it, eventually also improving through her involvement with the Juggernaut club program and at Pomona.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s playing well, and she\u2019s a good leader,\u201d Hilbert said, adding that Snider \u201cis a great example of a top-level Colorado player who could have gone somewhere else and chose to stay home and has had a great career because of it.\u201d\n\nSnider and senior outside hitter Marlee Reynolds, who is engaged to marry former CSU and current New York Giants center Weston Richburg in March, both traveled to Slovenia and Croatia with an MW all-star team last summer.\n\nThis fall term, Snider is working in a for-credit internship in the CSU volleyball office, helping plan travel.\n\n\u201cIf the flights aren\u2019t correct, it\u2019s my fault,\u201d she said. \u201cIf the food\u2019s not there, it\u2019s my fault. If we don\u2019t have rooms, if anything is wrong, it\u2019s my fault.\n\n\u201cSo it\u2019s been stressful.\u201d\n\nHas anything been her fault yet?\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Snider said, \u201cwe had our first trip last weekend (to Las Cruces) and it went smoothly. I went, \u2018Yes!\u2019 It was a personal victory.\u201d\n\nTerry Frei: tfrei@denverpost.com or twitter.com/TFrei", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Kelsey Snider helps No. 8 CSU seize volleyball court", "title": "Kelsey Snider helps No. 8 CSU seize volleyball court", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/09/20/kelsey-snider-helps-no-8-csu-seize-volleyball-court/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140919__20140920_B5_SP19VBCSU1p1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140919__20140920_B5_SP19VBCSU1p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-20T09:27:44+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T05:00:16+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "FORT COLLINS \u2014 When Colorado State volleyball star Kelsey Snider was a seventh-grader in Westminster, she sensed something was wrong.\nThis fall term, Snider is working in a for-credit internship in the CSU volleyball office, helping plan travel.\nSoon, Kelsey was found to be afflicted with the rare Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome, meaning she had an extra electrical pathway in her heart.\n\u201cEvery year I\u2019ve been here, we only made it to the first or second round,\u201d said the 6-foot-1 Snider.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Snider said, \u201cwe had our first trip last weekend (to Las Cruces) and it went smoothly."}
