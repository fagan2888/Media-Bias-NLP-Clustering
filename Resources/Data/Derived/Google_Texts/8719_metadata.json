Wednesday, March 19, 2014, Berkeley. (Photo: Robert Ward / Asbury Park Press)Buy Photo\n\nJACKSON \u2013 Changes to the township\u2019s \u201cno-knock\u201d ordinance, measures aimed at reining in over-aggressive solicitors, will likely be enacted into law by month\u2019s end.\n\nThe Jackson council on Tuesday unanimously voted to introduce the ordinance, encouraged and supported by about 25 members of the public who looked on.\n\n\u201cThe problem is not only are they knocking at your doors, they\u2019re pulling in the driveways and stopping in front of your house, blocking traffic and waving oncoming cars by,\u201d Green Valley Drive resident Brandy Jarmolowich said. \u201cMy children go to check the mailbox and play in the street. It\u2019s a real safety concern.\u201d\n\nThe council will hold a public hearing on the ordinance at its Aug. 25 meeting. If adopted there, it will become law.\n\nChanges to the ordinance were inspired by a rash of persistent, door-to-door real estate canvassers. Multiple residents have filed complaints with the township over such visitors who would not let up after asking a homeowner if they\u2019d consider selling their property. In extreme cases, residents reported the solicitors peering over fences and into windows.\n\nUnder the ordinance, any for-profit company \u2014 from plumbers to real estate agents \u2014 interested in door-to-door solicitation must receive a permit from the township. The permit will only be issued after submitting a list of all canvassers, specific streets and a date range of up to 30 days.\n\n\u201cThe concerns are about the intrusion of the privacy of the residents,\u201d Council President Barry Calogero said. \u201cEverywhere I go, residents come over very concerned about people knocking on the door and very rudely and obnoxiously trying to buy their house.\u201d\n\nSome residents have singled out members of the Orthodox Jewish community in Lakewood as the solicitors behind the perceived harassment. As the Lakewood community has boomed, Orthodox Jewish people from New York have sought property on the outskirts, particularly on the Jackson and Toms River borders.\n\nThe ordinance also reiterates sections of the federal Fair Housing Act, which prohibit real estate solicitors from implying that a neighborhood could under go an \u201cadverse\u201d change if a homeowner declines to sell their home.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s left to linger in people\u2019s minds that if they don\u2019t agree to sell, something bad will happen in the neighborhood,\u201d Councilman Rob Nixon said\n\nViolators would be subject of fines up to $1,250 and 90 days in county jail, an addition that Nixon said would discourage anyone willing to ignore the rules, including visiting a home on the township\u2019s no-knock registry.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very clear that if you\u2019re on the no-knock list, it\u2019s the responsibility of the solicitor or vendor to respect that list,\u201d Nixon said.\n\nThe ordinance specifically calls out for-profit endeavors: Activities protected under free speech laws, such as religious and political canvassing, are not affected by the ordinance.\n\n\u201cThe state has laws on the books about the sale of homes, including prohibitions on discrimination for race, religion and other reasons,\u201d ACLU of New Jersey legal director Ed Barocas said in an email.\n\nMike Davis: 732-643-4223 mdavis@gannettnj.com\n\nDon't miss a thing Download our apps and get alerts for local news, weather, traffic and more.
