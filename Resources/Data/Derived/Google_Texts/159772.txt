Tulsa promoters are taking their show on the road to Austin, Texas later this month.

VisitTulsa and several other local music and film groups announced Tuesday they're returning to South By Southwest [SXSW] for a second year.

Organizers say their main goal of a booth at 2016 SXSW trade show is to promote Tulsa as a place to live, work, play and be creative.

During a news conference Tuesday, the groups said the "Created In Tulsa" booth will serve as an opportunity to promote Tulsa as a creative and cultural hub focusing on the music, film and start up scene, as well as tourism.

"With South by Southwest is not so much as awesome, it is the whole world comes together and I think that especially with the lineup that they've chosen this year it really showcases how great Tulsa is. I think that this event especially, is going to show that Tulsa has a lot more to offer than what anyone has thought before." said Fiawna Forte, Tulsa musician.

In 2015, the SXSW trade show was home to 555 booths focusing on film, music, and interactive companies, and had approximately 70,500 attendees during the 4-day show. The 2016 show is set to exceed those numbers.

The groups said they will focus on promoting Tulsa's music scene, while featuring 10 different bands including Tulsa music icon, Leon Russell. The event is set for March 17 from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. in Austin, Texas.
