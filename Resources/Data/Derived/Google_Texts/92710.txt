MANCHESTER, N.H. -- If you live in New Hampshire and have a mailbox, there is a very good chance that it is currently stuffed with glossy campaign fliers detailing horrifying traits of specific presidential candidates.

Over the weekend, a variety of mail pieces begin showing up at homes here in Manchester. And if one New Hampshire couple’s collection of soon-to-be-recycled material was any indication of a larger trend, the majority of it was coming from the super PAC supporting Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.).

Conservative Solutions PAC sent out at least three separate negative fliers over the weekend. There was the one that my colleague Scott Conroy reported, depicting Jeb Bush as a monarch and making a subtle jab at his mother, Barbara Bush. There was another one attacking Bush by placing him side by side with Hillary Clinton.

“Two names from the past, tied to the past, with ideas from the past,” the flier reads.
