Ohio’s oil production since 2012 has been far short of state officials’ projections, free-market think tank Opportunity Ohio says in new report.

Low production plus sharply lower prices further complicate Gov. John Kasich’s plans to pay for a statewide income tax cut by hiking energy taxes, Opportunity Ohio president Matt Mayer explained in a Monday release.

Mayer’s analysis of records filed with the Ohio Department of Natural Resources revealed yearly statewide oil production tens of millions of barrels short of the Republican governor’s projections.

Ohio Oil Production: Gov. Kasich’s Estimates vs. Actual Results

Year Kasich-Estimated Producing Wells Actual Producing Wells Kasich-Estimated Production (Barrels) Actual Production (Barrels) 2012 172 76 (44%) 7,662,600 635,874 (8.3%) 2013 731 341 (47%) 35,584,650 3,678,734 (10.3%) 2014 (Q3 Annualized) 1,656 595 (36%) 84,281,850 12,054,664 (14.3%)

Ohio is one of several states where drilling for oil and natural gas has increased recently due to breakthroughs in hydraulic fracturing, or “fracking.” Since 2012, Kasich has been demanding Republicans in the Ohio General Assembly increase the severance taxes energy companies — and often, landowners — must pay when oil and gas are extracted from Ohioans’ property.

In his report, Mayer explained that low oil prices and production guarantee a severance tax hike would not be the revenue source Kasich has been counting on. And even without Kasich’s tax hike, low prices and production are already driving energy companies from Ohio.

“It is critical to put Ohio’s energy production in perspective,” Mayer wrote after citing recent layoffs in the industry.

“According to Baker Hughes Rig Count, there are currently 46 drilling rigs in Ohio, as there are 839 in Texas, 209 in Oklahoma, 169 in North Dakota, 109 in Louisiana, and 53 in Pennsylvania,” he explained.

“More importantly, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the Utica Shale oil production numbers compared to the Permian, Eagle Ford and Bakken formations are insignificant,” he continued. Much of eastern Ohio sits atop the Utica Shale formation.

“Specifically, the Utica formation is producing less than 33,000 barrels of oil per day compared to more than 1.2 million in the Bakken formation, 1.6 million in the Eagle Ford formation, and nearly 2.0 million in the Permian formation,” Mayer wrote.

“Everyone knows Governor Kasich is depserate to find sources from higher taxes to fund continued personal income tax reductions, but hiking taxes on Ohio’s energy industry at such a precarious time will inhibit future investment and production in Ohio,” Mayer wrote, noting that taxes on oil accounted for nearly 96 percent of Kasich’s projected severance tax hike revenue.

“With the price of oil declining, the marginal attractiveness Ohio held for energy companies is also declining. There is a reason BP, Shell, Devon, Anadarko — all top energy companies — and several smaller independent oil companies have left Ohio,” Mayer wrote.

Although Ohio levies a variety of other taxes on oil and gas drillers operating in the state, Kasich has argued the current severance tax is ridiculously low. The governor insists the tax could be increased dramatically without driving any energy companies away.

The Kasich administration did not respond to a request for comment on Opportunity Ohio’s report and the governor’s severance tax plans.

In an email exchange with Ohio Watchdog, Mayer said no one from the governor’s office has expressed an interest in his findings. Mayer indicated he expects to discuss the issue with lawmakers as the governor continues pushing for a severance tax hike.
