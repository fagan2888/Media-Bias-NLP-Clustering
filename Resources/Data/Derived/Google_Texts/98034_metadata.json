The two strands have been difficult to disentangle because the moments during which they\u2019ve flared up have involved elements of both: the debt-ceiling fights, the shutdowns, the Obamacare repeals, the primary challenges against any member who had ever tried to legislate, the opposition to comprehensive immigration reform. These episodes entailed both efforts to move the party substantively rightward and to precipitate more confrontation with Obama. The current moment of enthusiasm for Donald Trump is instructive because it pulls the strands apart. Trump\u2019s appeal reflects, in nearly singular form, the nonideological component of Republican rage. He is the candidate of affect.\n\nThe official (i.e., non-Trump) Republican Party has experienced its activist base during the Obama years as an incessant and implacable series of demands for ideological purity. Republicans have dutifully complied with every policy demand. They have refused to increase taxes, even at the cost of programs they support, like infrastructure and defense. They quickly withdrew cooperation from all of President Obama\u2019s legislative initiatives, opposed virtually all of his nominees, and joined self-destructive demonstrations of anger they knew would fail.\n\nIt has never been enough. Eric Cantor had dutifully toed the party line for his career and even repeatedly sabotaged John Boehner\u2019s nascent attempts to strike a fiscal compromise, and when a right-wing primary challenger defeated him last summer, Republicans decided they had to repudiate \u2026 the Export-Import Bank, a tiny and justifiably obscure federal program. George Will sagely explained Cantor\u2019s defeat like so: \u201c[H]e was a supporter of reauthorizing the Ex-Im Bank, and I think the Export-Import Bank, this will stun you as counterintuitive, played as larger role in that election as immigration did and they were all part of the same (inaudible) of issues that said this man is an insider not paying attention to normal people.\u201d\n\nNext to the tiny ideological bumps Republicans have obsessively smoothed from their record, Trump\u2019s profile of deviations is incomprehensibly vast. He has called himself pro-choice, endorsed single-payer health care, praised Hillary Clinton\u2019s performance as secretary of State, donated to Democrats, and called for a huge onetime tax on existing wealth. It must be galling for the party regulars to prostrate themselves helplessly before the base, purging any hint of independent thought, only to watch a formerly pro-choice, libertine if not liberal, Democratic donor waltz into the lead.\n\nThe contrast with Ted Cruz is telling. Cruz has fashioned himself as the leader of the tea-party movement in Washington, and he has mostly grasped the nature of conservative agita. Republicans believe their leaders have done too little to fight the president. \u201cI have yet to meet a person whose criticism of Congress is, 'You guys haven\u2019t cooperated with Obama enough,\u2019\u201d he announced the other day. (Which is preposterous, of course: Republicans in Congress wouldn\u2019t cooperate with Obama if Obama\u2019s idea was to help Nancy Reagan cross a busy intersection.)\n\nCruz has the knack for self-destructive political theater, competitive Reagan idolatry, and purer-than-pure factional infighting. But Trump has outdone him not just in celebrity appeal, but in calculated offensiveness. Trump\u2019s crude denunciation of Mexican immigrants as criminals made him the symbol of Republican nativism in the Latino community, yet this only enhanced his appeal. The most staggering indicator of his success to date is not that he has maintained his polling lead. It is that opposition among Republican voters has actually decreased. A month ago 59 percent of likely Republican voters said they would never vote for Trump. That has fallen to one third. The attacks on Trump have actually backfired.\n\nThe amorphous fervor of the right-wing base has stumped liberals as well as conservatives. Outsiders have struggled to comprehend how Republican voters can attach themselves to an economic agenda so plainly at odds with their own interest, or whip themselves into a frenzy over a manufactured outrage (whether it is Eli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez, ACORN, death panels, or the legitimacy of Obama\u2019s birth). Trump embodies that mysterious X factor that has eluded analysts of all sides. His affect supplies his appeal \u2014 he is strong, mad, and, above all, unapologetic in a world that demands he apologize. Trump is not the spokesman for an idea at all, but the representation of undifferentiated resentment.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#000", "description": "An unexpected candidacy reveals that it was never about ideas.", "generator": "the-factory", "og": {"site_name": "Daily Intelligencer", "description": "An unexpected candidacy reveals that it was never about ideas.", "title": "Donald Trump, Affect, and the Conservative Mind", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/08/donald-trump-affect-and-the-conservative-mind.html", "image": "http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2015/08/04/04-donald-trump-rage.w1200.h630.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "An unexpected candidacy reveals that it was never about ideas.", "creator": "@jonathanchait", "image": "http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2015/08/04/04-donald-trump-rage.w750.h560.2x.jpg", "title": "Donald Trump, Affect, and the Conservative Mind", "site": "@intelligencer", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Daily Intelligencer", "fb": {"app_id": 120608177953522}, "msapplication-TileImage": "//cache.nymag.com/media/di/icon.144x144.png", "application-name": "Daily Intelligencer", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "the national interest, politics, donald trump, campaign 2016, trump 2016", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NewYorkMag", "tag": "the national interest,politics,donald trump,campaign 2016,trump 2016", "published_time": "2015-08-04T16:30:00.000Z", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/JonathanChaitPublic"}, "topics": "topics-test, the national interest, politics, donald trump, campaign 2016, trump 2016", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfdb3\"", "article_summary": "A month ago 59 percent of likely Republican voters said they would never vote for Trump.\nTrump\u2019s appeal reflects, in nearly singular form, the nonideological component of Republican rage.\nThe current moment of enthusiasm for Donald Trump is instructive because it pulls the strands apart.\nIt is that opposition among Republican voters has actually decreased.\nThe spasms of rage within the Republican base that have flared on and off throughout the Obama era have an ideological component and an emotional component."}
