Oliver Reid will perform at the Metropolitan Room. Photo: Lynn Redmile\n\nJazz & Colors, \u2018The Masterworks Edition\u2019\n\nThe Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\n1000 Fifth Ave, (212) 535-7710\n\nFriday\n\nHere\u2019s an ingenious way to combine two art forms into what promises to be a memorably multidisciplinary evening. Start with a wide array of bands, selected with an emphasis on ensembles from all over the jazz world: These include the combination of the Iraqi-American trumpeter Amir ElSaffar and Norwegian saxophonist Ole Mathisen, the jazz-rock fusion chamber music ensemble Cellar and Point, guitarist Marvin\u2019s Sewell\u2019s group with Lonnie Plaxico, clarinetist-conceptualist Don Byron, and a dozen others. Then, arrange to have them play newly minted reinterpretations of classic jazz standards, from Cole Porter to Billy Strayhorn to Ornette Coleman. Finally, position these ensembles and these standard tunes in the various galleries of the Metropolitan\u2014the music will complement the masterpieces on the walls, and vice versa.\n\nLincoln Center\u2019s American Songbook, \u2018Reich and Sondheim: In Conversation and Performance\u2019\n\nThe Appel Room (Formerly the Allen Room)\n\nBroadway at 60th Street; Centercharge, (212) 721-6500\n\nSaturday\n\nBroadway\u2019s eternal experimentalist Stephen Sondheim meets the avant-garde classicist, minimalist, and percussion maven Steve Reich in this \u201cconversation and performance.\u201d The program will illuminate the influence these two giants have had on each other, using one Steve as a means of discussing the other. Performers include Paul and Alexander Gemignani, Kate Baldwin, Michael Cerveris, and Ensemble Signal.\n\nENLARGE Bettye LaVette at the Caf\u00e9 Carlyle Photo: Alan Nahigian\n\nBettye LaVette\n\nCaf\u00e9 Carlyle\n\n35 E. 76th St., (212) 744-1600\n\nThrough Feb. 7\n\nShe is one of the major interpreters of our time, and like her approximate British equivalent, Barb Jungr, she illustrates that the superior rock and soul songs of the contemporary era can be interpreted no less than Cole Porter or Richard Rodgers. Her current show features too many completely new numbers (most from her new album \u201cWorthy\u201d), and could also benefit from a greater diversity of moods and tempos (her opener, Dylan\u2019s \u201cUnbelievable,\u201d is the most cheerful song in the set). Still, what\u2019s here is powerful and moving: \u201cNights in White Satin\u201d is now a lacerating saloon song and even Paul McCartney \u2019s \u201cWait\u201d becomes a harrowing experience.\n\nT. Oliver Reid, \u2018Drop Me Off in Harlem\u2019\n\nThe Metropolitan Room\n\n34 W. 22nd St., (212) 206-0440\n\nSundays and other dates through May 31\n\n\u201cThere is no place you will ever see / Like this dusky town-within-a-town.\u201d Seen (but not heard enough) in Broadway\u2019s \u201cAfter Midnight,\u201d the remarkably versatile bari-tenor T. Oliver Reid shows how African-American music of the interwar years wasn't just one single style, but a polyglot of styles\u2014jazz, show music, gospel, blues\u2014and he does justice to the cumulative legacies of all of these genres at once.\n\nSteve Lippia, \u2018Sinatra Centennial\u2019\n\nBirdland\n\n315 W. 44th St., (212) 581-3080\n\nThrough Saturday\n\nThere is no mistaking Steve Lippia for the most obvious kind of Sinatra impersonator\u2014for one thing, the actual timbre his voice sounds more like a hybrid of Steve Lawrence and Harry Connick Jr. For another, while he sings many of the most obvious Sinatra signatures (\u201dMy Way,\u201d \u201cNew York, New York\u201d) he doesn\u2019t concentrate on what most people consider the fin-de-si\u00e8cle of Sinatra music\u2014the 1950s Nelson Riddle arrangements\u2014but instead offers more charts from the 1960s onward, such as Sy Oliver \u2019s updates of the Tommy Dorsey hits \u201cWithout a Song\u201d and \u201cI\u2019ll Be Seeing You.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "article.created": "2015-01-30T01:59:00.000Z", "article.section": "US", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "Article", "twitter": {"domain": "wsj.com", "description": "Ensembles from all over the jazz world perform at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Bettye LaVette is at the Carlyle and more in this week\u2019s Jazz Scene.", "title": "Masterworks at the Met", "image": {"src": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-GR828_NYJAZZ_G_20150129123501.jpg", "alt": "Jazz ensembles at Metropolitan Museum of Art, Bettye LaVette at Carlyle and more in Jazz Scene", "identifier": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-GR828_NYJAZZ_D_20150129123501.jpg"}, "site": "@WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "wsj://launch?articleid=SB12403670989460264059204580429604066201546&headline=Jazz%20ensembles%20at%20Metropolitan%20Museum%20of%20Art%2C%20Bettye%20LaVette%20at%20Carlyle%20and%20more%20in%20Jazz%20Scene&weburl=http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB12403670989460264059204580429604066201546"}}, "page.site.product": "WSJ", "keywords": "bettye lavette,cafe carlyle,jazz clubs,lincoln center,metropolitan museum of art,sinatra,stephen sondheim,steve lippia,steve reich,t. oliver reid,political,general news,arts,entertainment,music", "news_keywords": "bettye lavette,cafe carlyle,jazz clubs,lincoln center,metropolitan museum of art,sinatra,stephen sondheim,steve lippia,steve reich,t. oliver reid", "article.headline": "Jazz ensembles at Metropolitan Museum of Art, Bettye LaVette at Carlyle and more in Jazz Scene", "cXenseParse": {"candybar": {"image": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-GR828_NYJAZZ_E_20150129123501.jpg"}, "poptart": {"image": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-GR828_NYJAZZ_D_20150129123501.jpg"}}, "description": "Ensembles from all over the jazz world perform at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Bettye LaVette is at the Carlyle and more in this week\u2019s Jazz Scene.", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=364387007,app-argument=wsj://launch?articleid=SB12403670989460264059204580429604066201546&headline=Jazz%20ensembles%20at%20Metropolitan%20Museum%20of%20Art%2C%20Bettye%20LaVette%20at%20Carlyle%20and%20more%20in%20Jazz%20Scene&weburl=http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB12403670989460264059204580429604066201546", "user.type": "nonsubscriber", "article.page": "US", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.summary": "Ensembles from all over the jazz world perform at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Bettye LaVette is at the Carlyle and more in this week\u2019s Jazz Scene.", "page.site": "wsj", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2015-01-30T01:59:00.000Z", "dj.asn": "i-c647", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj", "image_count": 2, "word_count": 540, "external_link_count": 5}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Article", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Ensembles from all over the jazz world perform at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Bettye LaVette is at the Carlyle and more in this week\u2019s Jazz Scene.", "title": "Masterworks at the Met", "url": "http://www.wsj.com/articles/masterworks-at-the-met-1422583155", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-GR828_NYJAZZ_G_20150129123501.jpg", "height": 369}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "author": "Will Friedwald", "article.access": "free", "page.content.source": "WSJ Online Article", "article.origheadline": "Masterworks at the Met", "article.type": "NY Culture", "article.id": "SB12403670989460264059204580429604066201546", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-01-30T01:59:00.000Z"}, "article_summary": "ENLARGE T.
