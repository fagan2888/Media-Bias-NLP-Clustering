A man wanted by Lakewood police as a suspect in an attempted homicide case has been arrested in Texas.

Charlie Robert Brammeier, 30, was taken into custody Tuesday in Hartley County, Texas, after resisting arrest on warrants out of Lakewood, according to a Lakewood Police Department media release.

On Monday Lakewood police responded to the 1200 block of South Pierce Street on an assault. The victim, who was robbed, was beaten so severely that he remains in a coma in a local hospital.

Investigators identified Brammeier as the suspect in the case and issued a warrant for his arrest.
