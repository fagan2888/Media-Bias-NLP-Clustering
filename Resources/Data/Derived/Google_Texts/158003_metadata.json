Have you been following the U.S. Senate race between incumbent Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., and Republican Monica Wehby? Here's a chance to learn more about where they -- and the minor-party candidates in the race -- stand on issues such as the Affordable Care Act and other topics.\n\nIn the governor's race between Gov. John Kitzhaber and Rep. Dennis Richardson, we asked the candidates whether they support or oppose legal marijuana, driver cards, GMO labeling and other issues that will be decided in statewide measures.\n\nOur guide will also let you build a sample ballot. Enter your address to see the races and measures you'll vote on. You can also go to any race and compare candidates side by side. The guide also outlines statewide ballot measures and local initiatives, explaining what happens with a yes or no vote.\n\nTry the interactive guide and let us know what you think.\n\n-- Michelle Brence", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "2014 elections,2014 voter guide", "title": "Voting in Oregon?
