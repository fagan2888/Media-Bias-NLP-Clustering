These values help explain why consumer spending accounts for nearly 70 percent of our gross domestic product. Rational self-interest. The fruits of your labor. American dream. A dog chasing its tail.\n\nWell, I\u2019m broke.\n\nBut despite that, I feel I\u2019ve been very successful since leaving the military because I\u2019ve been able to fulfill my dreams of higher education while providing for my family. I\u2019m the beneficiary of a culture that values and exalts military members above most other groups, and laudatory political rhetoric has manifested over the years in a bevy of social programs, which I began taking advantage of when I left the military in 2011 after 13 years on active-duty. Unemployment benefits? Check. VA disability rating? Check. G.I. Bill? Check. VA healthcare that meets Obamacare requirements and shields me from penalty for not purchasing my own? Check.\n\nAnd don\u2019t forget my free dinner at Applebee\u2019s on Veterans Day.\n\nThe crown jewel of these benefits, in my view, is the new G.I. Bill. Conceived and championed by Senator Jim Webb of Virginia, the Post-9/11 Educational Assistance Act of 2008 provided a much-needed update to the Montgomery G.I. Bill.\n\nWith America\u2019s wars in Iraq and Afghanistan in full swing and no end in sight, Webb rightly saw the need to provide a new mechanism for veterans to afford higher education and transition into the new American economy. Ever since the government incentivized higher education so boldly, veterans like me have found it hard to turn down getting paid to earn college degrees.\n\nMy wife, a veteran of the Afghanistan War, is about to complete an associate\u2019s degree and transfer to a four-year university in Oregon, where she\u2019ll study health sciences on her way toward a doctorate in physical therapy.\n\nMy best friend grew up in a Miami ghetto and flunked out of high school. He will graduate from Columbia University with a BA in Philosophy thanks to a four-year stint in the Marines. He didn\u2019t even have to deploy to Iraq.\n\nThe friend who asked me to write this used his benefits to complete a master\u2019s degree in journalism at NYU. Other Marine friends are studying mathematics and economics at Fordham University; predictive analytics at Northwestern University; film at the University of Texas; screenwriting at USC; culinary college in Denver.\n\nI know several vets who have already earned or are pursuing a master\u2019s in military social work. They\u2019re seeking to fill a huge need in America\u2019s new post-war economy, assuming, of course, the war does actually end and another doesn\u2019t swiftly pop up in its place. Fingers crossed.\n\nMy contribution, my American dream, is to serve my country and humanity in the way I believe I was meant to \u2013 as a storyteller, a teacher and a good father. My military service has entitled me to the means to accomplish my dreams.\n\nI am less than six weeks from completing an MS in Multimedia Journalism from the University of Oregon. I started my undergraduate studies at a community college in a Sacramento suburb in 1996. I joined the Army in 1998 as an infantryman, deployed to Kosovo in 2000 and was honorably discharged in 2001.\n\nThen I joined the Marines as a combat correspondent just two weeks after Sept. 11, 2001. While serving, I earned numerous accolades and awards for my skills as a storyteller and leader of Marines, and by the time my final enlistment was up in October 2011, I had just two semesters left to finish my BS in Photojournalism from Syracuse, a trove of skills and experience, and the full support of the Department of Veterans Affairs and the American people.\n\nI\u2019m working on this American dream thing \u2014 the nice house with the big yard, a Cadillac healthcare plan, retirement and a college fund for my daughters, the whole enchilada. I will soon have a master\u2019s degree, which I can use to begin teaching at the college level.\n\nMy career as a freelance journalist, blogger and documentary filmmaker is off to a good start, and I\u2019m learning how to make self-employment work while I support my wife as she pursues her bachelor\u2019s degree. I\u2019m a devoted father of two amazing daughters. And while my income remains paltry for now, my family and I live a modest but happy life in a community we love.\n\nHard work has gotten us to this stage in our lives, and we feel our future is bright. But I think it\u2019s important to acknowledge that a lot of this success equation in America is luck and help from my fellow Americans. My wife and I couldn't have done it on our own.\n\nEthan E.
