The 2013 numbers tell the tale of their ingratitude. In 2013, for the 32nd consecutive year, the best-selling vehicle was Ford\u2019s F-Series pickups. This supremacy began, fittingly, in the first year of Ronald Reagan\u2019s deregulatory presidency. Today\u2019s consumers, who cannot get it through their thick heads that they are supposed to want wee vehicles such as Chevrolet\u2019s Volt, bought 763,402 F-Series trucks. That is 740,308 more than the number of Volts General Motors sold.\n\nIn a recent column , George F. Will suggests that consumer preferences are always going to win out over big government\u2019s finger-wagging and incentives to do whatever it is liberals claim is the right thing. Prognosticating about the future of the Affordable Care Act, universal preschool and a possible minimum wage hike, he extrapolates from the auto market:\n\nHe adds that the government\u2019s \u201cincentive for Volt buyers is a tax credit up to $7,500,\u201d but it is no match for the public\u2019s preferences for big, all-American trucks.\n\nThere\u2019s just one problem with this argument: The government also offers a major tax incentive to buy trucks.\n\nTaxpayers often buy vehicles and claim them as business expenses so they can deduct the cost of the purchase. There are limits to how quickly the value of the vehicle depreciates for tax purposes. But trucks and heavy S.U.V.\u2019s get preferential treatment \u2014 meaning that you can take a larger deduction for big, gas-guzzling vehicles \u2014 which is why your accountant might suggest that your next business-related vehicle purchase be a Ford F-Series.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20140111080023, "BN": "economix", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "businessday/economix", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/economix/post", "per": "Will, George F", "org": "Ford Motor Co", "keywords": "Will George F,Automobiles,Federal Taxes (US),Tax Credits Deductions and Exemptions,Ford Motor Co,Uncategorized", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/economix/Consumer Preferences vs. Tax Breaks ( 20140111 )", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Catherine Rampell", "SCG": "Economy", "sourceApp": "blogs", "CLMST": "Catherine Rampell", "byl": "Catherine Rampell", "twitter": {"description": "The columnist George Will recently took aim at tax breaks for environmentally friendly cars.
