On Friday’s edition of The Laura Ingraham Show, host Laura Ingraham spoke about the Ebola outbreak. She disapproves of President Barack Obama’s decision to send troops to West Africa to help fight the outbreak and argues, instead, for the global equivalent of locking yourself inside your house and hiding until the outbreak works itself out.

“Is this the American military mission to assist in the fight against Ebola? Again if we are really serious about Ebola being a threat to the United States of America, we have to shut down our border because you never know who could come across–probably not people with Ebola, but who knows. We gotta be much tougher on who we allow to come into this country legally on planes…”

She then likely thought, ‘I haven’t been offensive enough in this three minute clip. How do convey that I don’t understand international humanitarian aid while being as offensive as possible?’
