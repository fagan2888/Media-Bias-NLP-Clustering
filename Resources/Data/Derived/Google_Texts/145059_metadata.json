But with the sun visible only briefly, the party was markedly shorter than in past years. Authorities reported nine arrests for drug offenses \u2014 fewer than in the past.\n\nVisitors kissed the stones, dancers swirled on the grass and drummers pounded as part of the free-form celebrations. A small group of yoga enthusiasts held a short class and couples renewed their commitments to one another.\n\nStonehenge is an icon of Britain, and one of its most popular attractions.
