Allen Jr., CNN\n\nROME (CNN) - Pope Francis has sketched a vision of a Catholic Church that\u2019s more welcoming \u2013 to women, to homosexuals, to divorced and remarried believers, to pretty much everybody \u2013- and less invested in the culture wars.\n\nIn a now famous interview published Thursday, the pope said he knows some militants want him to toss around more fire and brimstone. But he insists that Catholic positions on hot-button issues such as abortion and gay marriage are already well known, and anyway, \u201cMinisters of the church must be ministers of mercy above all.\u201d\n\nNone of that implies a change in church teaching, but it does suggest a fairly serious shift in tone. The question now becomes, is this just the pope talking? Or is he capable of bringing the rest of the church along with him?\n\nDespite the mythology of Roman Catholicism as a top-down monolith, the truth is that it\u2019s actually one of the most decentralized institutions on Earth.\n\nThere are only about 3,000 personnel in the Vatican directing the affairs of a church that counts 1.2 billion members, which means that Rome doesn\u2019t have the manpower to micromanage anything but exceptional cases.\n\nProbably 90% of the decisions that matter \u2013 what pastor will be assigned to which parish, or what tithes will be used for \u2013- are made at the local level.\n\nPopes trying to steer this colossus in a new direction, therefore, need middle managers as well as the rank and file to pull in the same direction, and experience suggests they don\u2019t always fall in line.\n\nMORE ON CNN: Pope Francis: Church can't 'interfere' with gays\n\nPope John Paul II, nearly 27 years, exhorted the church to be more evangelical, more daring about taking its message to the streets, and while he unleashed powerful new energies \u2013 think about World Youth Days, for instance \u2013 that missionary aspiration still remains a work in progress.\n\nSimilarly, Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI desired a church more appreciative of tradition and more focused on its core identity, and again most observers would say the end result over eight difficult years was a mixed bag.\n\nIf Francis is to bring the Catholic Church into line with his more pastoral and compassionate vision, two fronts seem especially critical.\n\nFirst is personnel. Nothing a pope does to shape culture in the church is more important than naming the roughly 5,100 bishops of the world, who set the tone in their own backyards.\n\nA new papal direction may be invigorating, but if people don\u2019t pick up the same vibe from their local bishops and pastors, over time it will only seem like sound and fury signifying little.\n\nTo date Francis hasn\u2019t made many flagship picks except for his own successor in Buenos Aires, Argentina, but he\u2019ll have to do so soon, since archbishops in critical locales such as Madrid, Cologne and Chicago are all older than 75, the normal retirement age.\n\nPopes typically rely on their nuncios, or ambassadors, around the world to recommend new bishops.\n\nIn June, Francis gave his nuncios their marching orders, saying he wants bishops who are \u201cclose to the people, fathers and brothers\u201d as well as \u201cgentle, patient and merciful.\u201d He also said they shouldn\u2019t have \u201cthe psychology of princes.\u201d\n\nHow well he spots talent to fit that profile will help determine whether his dream of moving past what he called \u201ca church of small-minded rules\u201d becomes reality.\n\nMORE ON CNN: The pope said what? Six stunners from Francis\n\nThe other key test is structural reform, beginning in the Vatican and radiating outward, perhaps especially on financial transparency and the fight against child sexual abuse.\n\nScandals in those areas have plagued the Vatican and the wider church in recent years, making it difficult for many people to see Catholicism as a vehicle for compassion.\n\nFrancis has set up three commissions to ponder reform, including a body of eight cardinals from around the world set to hold its first meeting in Rome from October 1-3.\n\nIf those groups don\u2019t deliver significant recommendations, which are embraced and implemented by the pope, once again his rhetoric about reforming the church may ring hollow.\n\nPopes play many roles, including prophet and CEO. Francis has delivered a stunning debut as the church\u2019s voice of conscience and spiritual guide; now he has to get down to the brass tacks of management to make sure it doesn\u2019t go to waste.\n\nJohn L.
