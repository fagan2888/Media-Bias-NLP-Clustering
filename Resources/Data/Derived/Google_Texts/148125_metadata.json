That\u2019s a slight improvement from Georgia\u2019s 40th-place ranking in 2008.\n\nThe report, for the first time, also tracked the distribution and number of physician assistants in Georgia. PAs are not physicians but are qualified to perform many of the duties that doctors routinely handle.\n\nThe doctor shortage is most critical in primary care/core specialties, which the Georgia board defines as family medicine, internal medicine, pediatrics, OB/GYN and general surgery.\n\nAnd the primary care gaps are more critical in rural counties and some inner-city areas, said Cherri Tucker, executive director of the Board for Physician Workforce, which has been producing such reports since 1986.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not getting the physicians in fast enough to meet population demands,\u201d Tucker said.\n\nThe overall population of Georgia increased by 18.3 percent from 2000 to 2010. The state\u2019s physician workforce actually outpaced that, growing by 26 percent. But a breakdown of that workforce growth paints a less rosy picture.\n\nThe increase for primary care doctors was 14.5 percent, compared with 36.7 percent for specialist physicians. The numbers for family medicine, internal medicine and pediatrics all improved, while ob/gyn and general surgery actually fell.\n\nMeanwhile, the overall physician population is aging. More than half are 50 or older, the report found.\n\n\u201cIt is a concern,\u201d Tucker said. Nationally, many doctors are retiring early, at age 55, she said. \u201cIf physicians in Georgia opt to retire earlier, we will have a much worse shortage of physicians than we expect.\u201d\n\nMany counties lacked a primary care practitioner in a given field: Six counties had no family medicine physician, 31 had no internal medicine physician and 63 had no pediatrician. Additionally, 79 counties had no OB/GYN, and 66 counties had no general surgeon, the report noted.\n\n\u201cThis report further indicates the great demand for primary care in our rural communities,\u201d Matt Caseman, executive director of the Georgia Rural Health Association, said. \u201cWe must be aggressive about recruiting and retaining our physicians.\u201d\n\nStudies show a rural physician can generate up to 23 jobs in the local economy, Caseman added.\n\nThe physician workforce in Georgia is growing more racially diverse. In 2010, 70.6 percent of doctors were white, down from 86.5 percent in 1992. About 10 percent of Georgia doctors speak Spanish, the report found.\n\nThere was an increase in the percentage of physicians who accept new Medicaid and new Medicare patients, in comparison to 2008.\n\nThe data for physician assistants, Tucker said, showed there isn\u2019t a sufficient supply in the state, and that they are not well distributed geographically.\n\nPAs, along with nurse practitioners (who also can handle many of the duties frequently left up to doctors), are considered part of the solution to primary care shortages in rural areas, especially with the coverage expansions from the Affordable Care Act.\n\nYet the state was 35th in the number of PAs per 100,000 population, and a large majority, 78.7 percent, were practicing in metropolitan areas.\n\nThe report found 49 counties did not have a physician assistant who practiced primarily in that county. And just 3 in 10 Georgia PAs worked in primary care.\n\nTucker said to solve the physician shortage, the state needs more initiatives to recruit doctors and get them to remain in Georgia. Such programs include school loan repayments, an increased number of medical residency programs and making the state a more attractive place for doctors to practice.\n\n\u2022 Georgia Health News (georgiahealthnews.com) is an independent news organization devoted to covering health care in the state.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Athens News, Athens Georgia, Athens Banner Herald, Athens, Georgia, Georgia Bulldogs, Dawgs, Bulldogs, Music, UGA, newspaper, 30601, Clarke County, Madison, Oconee, Oglethorpe, Dogs, 30602, 30603, 30604, 30605, Richt, SEC football, Jackson County, R.E.M., Widespread Panic, B-52s, Health, Local News, Features, Andy Miller", "og": {"url": "http://onlineathens.com/health/2014-01-05/doctor-shortage-georgia-remains-acute-rural-areas", "site_name": "Online Athens", "type": "article", "description": "Georgia's physician shortage continues to limit patients' access to care, especially in rural areas, a recently released report indicates.", "title": "Doctor shortage in Georgia remains acute in rural areas"}, "description": "OnlineAthens.com is the daily online edition of The Athens (GA) Banner-Herald."}, "article_summary": "\u201cThis report further indicates the great demand for primary care in our rural communities,\u201d Matt Caseman, executive director of the Georgia Rural Health Association, said.\nGeorgia\u2019s physician shortage continues to limit patients\u2019 access to care, especially in rural areas, a recently released report indicates.\nBut the report by the Georgia Board for Physician Workforce also highlights some promising trends on doctors practicing in Georgia.\n\u201cWe must be aggressive about recruiting and retaining our physicians.\u201dStudies show a rural physician can generate up to 23 jobs in the local economy, Caseman added.\nThe doctor shortage is most critical in primary care/core specialties, which the Georgia board defines as family medicine, internal medicine, pediatrics, OB/GYN and general surgery."}
