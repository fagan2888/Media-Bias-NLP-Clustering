(iWitness photo)\n\nIt wouldn't be winter in the #iceboxofct if a rain storm didn't finish up with heavy snow! (Norfolk CT FDEMS PIO)\n\nSnow is covering the ground and roads throughout Connecticut on Saturday morning.\n\nAhead of the storm, Eyewitness News declared it an Early Warning Weather Day because of the heavy rains.\n\nEarly risers woke up to a \"soggy situation\" as heavy rains fall throughout the state. However, the storm changed over to snow in many towns in OTlland and Litchfield counties.\n\n\"Snow is now mixing down in the hills both east and west of Hartford, even on some of the lower hills,\" WFSB Meteorologist Mike Cameron said.\n\nTrack the storm with Early Warning Pinpoint Doppler here.\n\nThere are reports of black ice in Tolland County. Drivers are being cautioned to time their time on the roads.\n\n\" Heavy, wet flakes will coat the ground and roads in many locations over the next few hours before tapering off at around noon,\" Cameron said.\n\nWEATHER ALERT: #IcyConditions are reported in #Tolland. #UseCaution #BlackIce #TollandWorks will be out to treat rds pic.twitter.com/0kJKfv72il \u2014 Tolland Alert (@TollandAlert) January 16, 2016\n\nA coating of snow to an inch or two is possible in some Connecticut towns.\n\n\"It will be the clingy snow that covers everything; the woods will look especially snowy for the next few hours in the hills inland,\" Cameron said.\n\nThe storms brought gusty winds with gusts up to 30 mph or higher.\n\nThe temperatures are in the 30s on Saturday morning.\n\nThe rains and the snow should be gone by Saturday afternoon.\n\nCameron said they are watching a second storm headed towards the state.\n\n\"With the influx of cold air comes the risk of flurries and perhaps even a few snow squalls Monday.
