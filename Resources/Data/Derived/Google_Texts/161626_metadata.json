She would replace Eric Holder and become the first black woman to hold the nation\u2019s top law enforcement job.\n\nAlthough most Republicans, including Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, planned to oppose her, they seemed ready to move on after delaying her vote for a variety of reasons \u2014 most recently to complete work on a human trafficking bill that got ensnared in an unexpected and lengthy dispute over abortion. A compromise on that issue was reached earlier this week and the trafficking bill was unanimously approved on Wednesday.\n\nMcConnell barely mentioned the Lynch vote in his opening remarks on the Senate floor Thursday.\n\n\u201cToday we\u2019ll consider the president\u2019s nominee for attorney general, Loretta Lynch,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cLast month, I said the Senate would consider this nominee as soon as we passed an all-important anti-slavery bill, and today, we\u2019ll consider the nominee.\u201d\n\nDemocrats have grown incensed over the long delay in confirming Lynch, with Obama himself weighing in last week to lament Senate dysfunction and decry the wait as \u201ccrazy\u201d and \u201cembarrassing.\u201d Yet Democrats controlled the Senate when Lynch was nominated last November and could have brought up her nomination for a vote then. They held off with the GOP\u2019s encouragement after being routed in the midterm elections, and spent the time confirming judges instead.\n\nThere was an expectation that Republican leaders would move Lynch\u2019s nomination swiftly this year, especially since most GOP members of Congress loathe Holder, who\u2019s seen as too politically close to Obama and even more liberal. But instead, the nomination became tangled in the dispute over Obama\u2019s executive actions limiting deportations for millions of immigrants in the country illegally. Once Lynch voiced support for Obama\u2019s moves, a number of potential Republican supporters abandoned her, and her nomination seemed to stall.\n\nStill, five Republicans have said they intend to vote for Lynch \u2014 Mark Kirk of Illinois, Jeff Flake of Arizona, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Orrin Hatch of Utah and Susan Collins of Maine. That means she would win confirmation with at least 51 votes and no need for Vice President Joe Biden to cast a tie-breaking vote, as had looked possible in recent months.\n\nLynch, who grew up in North Carolina, has been the top prosecutor since 2010 for a district that includes Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island and Long Island, a role she also held from 1999 to 2001. She is seen as a straight shooter, has wide law enforcement support and is viewed as a noncontroversial choice.", "article_metadata": {"description": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Senate Democrats argued Thursday for long-overdue confirmation of President Barack Obama's attorney general pick, Loretta Lynch, as her nomination headed for a confirmation vote after a five-month wait.", "pubdate": 20150423, "og": {"site_name": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Senate Democrats argued Thursday for long-overdue confirmation of President Barack Obama's attorney general pick, Loretta Lynch, as her nomination headed for a confirmation vote after a five-month wait.", "title": "Loretta Lynch heads for confirmation as attorney general", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/158214825.jpg", "url": "http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/loretta-lynch-heads-confirmation-attorney-general/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Senate Democrats argued Thursday for long-overdue confirmation of President Barack Obama's attorney general pick, Loretta Lynch, as her nomination headed for a confirmation vote after a five-month wait.", "title": "Loretta Lynch heads for confirmation as attorney general", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/158214825.jpg", "creator": "@newshour", "site": "@newshour", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"app_id": 114150878604116}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newshour", "tag": "Loretta Lynch"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Loretta Lynch"}, "article_summary": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Senate Democrats argued Thursday for long-overdue confirmation of President Barack Obama\u2019s attorney general pick, Loretta Lynch, as her nomination headed for a confirmation vote after a five-month wait.\n\u201cToday we\u2019ll consider the president\u2019s nominee for attorney general, Loretta Lynch,\u201d McConnell said.\nMcConnell barely mentioned the Lynch vote in his opening remarks on the Senate floor Thursday.\nOnce Lynch voiced support for Obama\u2019s moves, a number of potential Republican supporters abandoned her, and her nomination seemed to stall.\nShe is seen as a straight shooter, has wide law enforcement support and is viewed as a noncontroversial choice."}
