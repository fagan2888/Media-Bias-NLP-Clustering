His weight had ballooned to 320 pounds, and he was spending more than $1,000 a month on medications for high blood pressure, Type 2 diabetes and high cholesterol.\n\nIn 2010, a physician told him to buy a funeral plot, because he would need it in five years. He was 51 years old.\n\nSo he went to talk with a naturopathic doctor about losing weight. She said: Get a shelter dog.\n\nO\u2019Grey was surprised, but he took that advice, heading to the Humane Society Silicon Valley near his home in San Jose. He told the shelter, \u201cI want an obese middle-aged dog, like me.\u201d That\u2019s how he met Peety.\n\nPeety needed to be walked, so Eric and Peety walked, for at least a half-hour a day. O\u2019Grey, who was working as an area sales manager for GE appliances, shifted to a plant-based diet. Over the course of a year, he lost 140 pounds. Peety lost 25. O\u2019Grey got off the meds.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just the walks with Peety that transformed O\u2019Grey\u2019s life. The dog helped keep him from backsliding into his old, unhealthful ways. \u201cHe looked at me like I was the best person on the planet, and I wanted to become the person he thought I was.\u201d\n\nTheir story might have ended there. But Carol Novello, president of the Humane Society Silicon Valley, had been trying to make the point that helping animals improves the lives of humans, too. She was finding that a tough sell, so she started looking for stories that made the case. \u201cA while ago, Eric O\u2019Grey submitted his story, and I just loved it.\u201d\n\nNovello, a former tech executive, asked David Whitman, executive producer of the Tech Awards of Silicon Valley, what they could do with Eric and Peety\u2019s story. He came up with the idea of the Mutual Rescue initiative, which includes a contest where people can share stories of how a shelter animal changed their lives. The winning tale gets a video made about their rescue story. Donors to the HSSV funded the production of the Eric and Peety video as an example.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really about the transformation and the impact that animals can have on our lives,\u201d Novello says.\n\nSince the contest opened in February, the HSSV has received hundreds of stories, many of which focus on health. \u201cWe may do a Mutual Rescue weight-loss series,\u201d Novello says. \u201cThere are a lot of them.\u201d\n\nSure, stories are nice, but do pets really improve human health? No less an authority than the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says yes. Having a pet can help decrease blood pressure, cholesterol, triglycerides and feelings of loneliness, the CDC says, while increasing opportunities for exercise and socializing with other humans. And there\u2019s increasing evidence that interaction with pets helps people cope with challenges, including PTSD, Alzheimer\u2019s and the end of life.\n\nI know our shelter kitties make my family happier, even though they haven\u2019t helped me lose weight. And watching the Eric and Peety video has to be good for my heart, though it makes me reach for the tissues every time.\n\n\u201cHe transformed me into a completely different person,\u201d O\u2019Grey says in the video. \u201cI think about it now: Who rescued whom? Did I rescue him, or did he rescue me?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Eric O'Grey was 51, obese and suffering from diabetes and high cholesterol when he took home an overweight shelter dog.
