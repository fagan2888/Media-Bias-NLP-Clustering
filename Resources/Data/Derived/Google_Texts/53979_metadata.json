It was the only day the snow melted in that long winter.\n\nBlair, a student at North Dakota State University at the time, was to miss classes the following week so he and Jo Anne could honeymoon. As it turned out, there was a big blizzard and the university was closed all week.\n\nThey are both retired, Blair from NCAR and Jo Anne from St. Vrain Valley School District. They have traveled extensively and particularly enjoyed more than 50 trips with Elderhostel, now called Roads Scholars. The couple have volunteered at their church, First Presbyterian, as well as Boulder Senior Center and Boulder Open Space and Mountain Parks.\n\nThey have six children: Blair (Lanette), of Longmont; Paul (Cathy), of Broomfield; Jean Ann Day (John), of Crestone; Tom (Mavanee) of Lafayette; Mary Beth Jackson (Doug), of Englewood, and Scott (Becky) of Bend, Ore. The couple have 20 grandchildren and 12 great-grandchildren.\n\nBlair and Jo Anne will celebrate in the summer with a gathering of the family.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/milestones/ci_27662639/anniversary-blair-and-jo-anne-smallwood", "endDate": "2025-03-06T17:12:44-0700", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:27662639:view"}, "startDate": "2015-03-08T06:00:00-0600", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "Blair and Jo Anne Smallwood,  of Boulder, were married March 4, 1950, in a Presbyterian church in Casselton, N.D.
