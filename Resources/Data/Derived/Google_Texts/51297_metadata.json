They then reviewed each question within each category to capture the range of issues that assisters had to solve. These ranged from questions about whether the caller qualified for financial assistance to those concerning technical issues and duplicate accounts from prior enrollment efforts.\n\nThe report concluded that assisters are still an extremely important source of information for marketplace consumers. The rules that govern eligibility and enrollment are complex and evolving, and are often challenging because all households are different, with varying income with diverse coverage needs.\n\n\"Without doubt, one-on-one assistance is and will continue to be essential for many consumers, a large proportion of whom would not ultimately enroll into coverage without the guidance assisters provide,\" the researchers wrote.\n\nAssisters are also a valuable source to the marketplace, because they give feedback regarding member experiences that allow officials to identify and address systemic or policy-related problems as they arise, the report says. Going forward, the researchers add that policymakers must prioritize areas of greatest need, as funding for assister programs is not infinite.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here is the report\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nRole of ACA enrollment navigators, assisters continues to evolve\n\nHealth exchange assisters continue to enroll consumers amid funding uncertainty\n\nBrokers take on new role as reform navigator", "article_metadata": {"description": "As consumers continue to have complex questions about the process of signing up for a health plan through Affordable Care Act marketplaces, the assisters who answer these questions play a vital role in ensuring enrollment success, according to a new\u00a0report\u00a0from the Robert Wood Foundation.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthPayer", "description": "As consumers continue to have complex questions about the process of signing up for a health plan through Affordable Care Act marketplaces, the assisters who answer these questions play a vital role in ensuring enrollment success, according to a new\u00a0report\u00a0from the Robert Wood Foundation.", "title": "Report: ACA marketplace assisters still play vital role", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthpayer.com/story/report-aca-marketplace-assisters-still-play-vital-role/2016-05-10", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthpayer.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "healthpayer", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "keywords": "Assister Help Resource Center,assisters,Care Delivery,consumer resources,Health Insurance Exchanges,one-on-one assistance,Operations & Business Management", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Health Insurance Exchanges,Operations & Business Management"}, "article_summary": "The report concluded that assisters are still an extremely important source of information for marketplace consumers.\nTo learn more:- here is the reportRelated Articles:Role of ACA enrollment navigators, assisters continues to evolveHealth exchange assisters continue to enroll consumers amid funding uncertaintyBrokers take on new role as reform navigator\nThey then reviewed each question within each category to capture the range of issues that assisters had to solve.\nAs consumers continue to have complex questions about the process of signing up for a health plan through Affordable Care Act marketplaces, the assisters who answer these questions play a vital role in ensuring enrollment success, according to a new report from the Robert Wood Foundation.\nAssisters are also a valuable source to the marketplace, because they give feedback regarding member experiences that allow officials to identify and address systemic or policy-related problems as they arise, the report says."}
