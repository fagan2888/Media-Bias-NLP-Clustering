Of the 10 states with the largest number of Hispanic children, four states had rates of uninsured children below the national average and two were not statistically different than the average.\n\nArizona was one of four states in 2014 with uninsured rates \u201csignificantly higher\u201d than the national average of 9.7 percent, at 12.7 percent. The Arizona uninsured rate dropped 2.4 percent from 2013, the researchers said.\n\nThere are an estimated 89,000 Hispanic children in Arizona with no health coverage.\n\nAcross all Arizona children, 10 percent do not have health insurance. Nationally that rate is 6 percent.\n\nArizona is the only state that does not accept federal funding for the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, called KidsCare, which the study authors cite as contributing to the state\u2019s above-average rate. A bill is before the Arizona Legislature to restore KidsCare for families that make too much to qualify for Medicaid.\n\nJoe Fu is the health policy director for the Children\u2019s Action Alliance, an Arizona advocacy organization that supports restoration of KidsCare.\n\n\u201cWe do know that among Hispanic children there are higher rates of un-insurance, so I think that the (KidsCare) program would really be helpful not just for all children in the state but also to help address the high rates of un-insurance among Hispanic kids as well,\u201d Fu said.\n\nFu said health care coverage \u201caddresses the physical, mental and developmental health needs of all kids. Health coverage helps improve their educational outcomes and they perform better at school and are not sick.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Arizona Science Desk is a collaboration of public broadcasting entities in the state, including Arizona Public Media.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "https://www.azpm.org/p/crawler-stories/2016/1/19/80234-study-more-arizona-hispanic-children-have-health-insurance/", "image": "https://media.azpm.org/master/image/2015/12/31/segment-thumb/anonymouskids_segthumb.jpg", "description": "Number has grown, but Arizona remains above national average.", "title": "Study: Too Many State Latino Children Remain Uninsured"}, "MSSmartTagsPreventParsing": "true", "publish_date": "2016-01-19T05:00:00", "Copyright": "Arizona Public Media, 2007-2012"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2e25\"", "article_summary": "More Hispanic children nationwide had health coverage in 2014 than 2013, due in large part to the Affordable Care Act.\nThe Arizona uninsured rate dropped 2.4 percent from 2013, the researchers said.\nOf the 10 states with the largest number of Hispanic children, four states had rates of uninsured children below the national average and two were not statistically different than the average.\nMedia Player ErrorUpdate your browser or Flash pluginThe number of Hispanic children covered by medical insurance has increased in Arizona, but the state\u2019s uninsured rate remains above the national average.\nThere are an estimated 89,000 Hispanic children in Arizona with no health coverage."}
