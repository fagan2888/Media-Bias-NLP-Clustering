This is just people finding a way to steal stuff,\u201d Carron Morgan, cousin of Freddie Gray, told Kevin Rector of the Baltimore Sun yesterday. That\u2019s one of the most clear-headed interpretations of yesterday\u2019s mob violence in Maryland\u2019s largest city, which followed the convergence of hundreds of youths at 3 p.m. outside Mondawmin Mall, a shopping center on the city\u2019s west side that also serves as a hub for bus service. In the resulting tumult, groups of rioters burned police vehicles, looted stores and restaurants, and injured more than a dozen Baltimore police officers with flying missiles.\n\nMore than twenty years ago in the Cato Journal, distinguished law and economics scholars David Haddock and Daniel Polsby published a paper entitled \u201cUnderstanding Riots\u201d that\u2019s still highly relevant in making sense of events like these. Employing familiar economic concepts such as opportunity cost, coordination problems, and free-rider issues, Haddock and Polsby help explain why riots cluster around sports wins as well as assassinations, funerals, and jury verdicts; the group psychology of rioting, and why most crowds never turn riotous; the important role of focal points (often lightly policed commercial areas) and rock-throwing \u201centrepreneurs\u201d of disorder; the tenuous relationship between riots and root causes or contemporary grievances; and why when a riot occurs the police (at least those in places like the United States and United Kingdom) seldom manage to be in enough places at once, more or less by definition.\n\nThe H&P paper helps explain why so many of the memes of the past 24 hours are off base: the \u201cprotests turn violent\u201d headlines (yesterday\u2019s riots broke out in different places from where there had been demonstrations), the \u201cFreddie Gray\u2019s family is horrified\u201d stories (irrelevant since this riot, like most, had little to do with sending any message of protest), and, of course, the \u201cwhat about sports riots?\u201d meme (yes, the riots yesterday have a lot in common with English soccer riots, and it\u2019s important to understand why.) \u201cAuthorities looking for ways to explain why trouble has broken out on their watch sometimes ascribe exaggerated organizational powers to \u2018outside agitators,\u2019\u201d Haddock and Polsby write. (Check.)\n\nIn reaction to yesterday\u2019s events, pundits have tended to bark up a number of wrong trees, such as the supposed permission-giving remarks of the city\u2019s Mayor, Stephanie Rawlings-Blake. (Not really, as Dave Weigel explains.) Others imagine that the technical advances of recent years \u2013 whether the availability of social media by which rioters can share intentions, or the ubiquity of surveillance cameras in public places \u2013 will fundamentally alter the balance between the riotous impulse and public order.
