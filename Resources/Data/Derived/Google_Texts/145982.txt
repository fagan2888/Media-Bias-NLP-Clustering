Rep. Jim McDermott (D-Wash.) had some choice words for Republicans on Thursday, hurling an expletive to describe the government shutdown stalemate.

In an interview with Slate, McDermott said the GOP "can't figure out how to admit" that they've lost the battle on Obamacare.

"Why would House Democrats give away what the Supreme Court and the 2012 electorate didn’t?," McDermott said. 'You can’t say, OK, you get half of Obamacare—this isn’t a Solomonic decision. So we sit here until they figure out they f*ck*n’ lost.”

A HuffPost/YouGov poll released Saturday shows that both parties are facing blame for the government shutdown, which stretched into its fifth day. According to the survey, 25 percent of Americans see Republicans and Democrats as being equally at fault. On party lines, 36 percent point a finger squarely at Republicans and 33 percent place more blame on President Barack Obama and the Democrats.

On Saturday, the House unanimously passed legislation giving federal employees backed pay for the time they were out of work due to the shutdown. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) said this was a "cruel" message to those workers.

"What the Republicans in the House are telling -- because they're the ones that set the agenda -- all these federal workers [is] ... even though we don't like federal workers and we haven't given you a raise in three years, what we're going to do now is give you a paid vacation," Reid said.
