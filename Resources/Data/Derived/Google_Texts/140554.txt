DARE COUNTY, N.C. (WAVY) — Task force officers in Dare County arrested a man for drug trafficking on Friday.

An investigation into a person allegedly transporting large quantities of cocaine into the area led the Dare County Narcotics Task Force to conduct a vehicle stop in the East Lake Community. A search of the vehicle revealed “a trafficking amount of crack and powder cocaine,” according to Chief Deputy Steve Hoggard with the Dare County Sheriff’s Office.

Task force officers also found cash, which was seized, along with the drugs.

The driver, 23-year-old Timothy Javon White, was arrested and charged with trafficking cocaine by transportation, trafficking cocaine by possession, possession with intent to sell or deliver cocaine, and felony aid and abet.

At the time of his arrest, White was out of prison on bond because of similar charges in Chowan County, Hoggard said.

White, who is from Edenton, was committed to the Dare County Detention Center on a $70,000 bond.
