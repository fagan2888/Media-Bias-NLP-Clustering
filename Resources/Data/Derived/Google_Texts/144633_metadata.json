The goal was recruiting 250 professionals like Nesbitt to teach math and science in county middle and high schools.\n\nBut finding prospective teachers to complete the rigorous program has proven difficult. Now in its fifth and final year of recruiting, it has led to the hiring of just 100 STEM teachers.\n\nScott Richman, who oversees the program as the district\u2019s supervisor of professional development, estimates that about half of the original goal will be reached by the fall. He hopes to hire 30 new teachers for next school year to bring the total amount of SMART teachers to 130.\n\n\u201cIt has been an issue to find math and science teachers,\u201d said Richman, who went to school to be a veterinarian, but decided to teach instead. \u201cThe standards to become a teacher are very high. They realize \u2018it\u2019s not for me\u2019 and that\u2019s OK. We only want the best people.\u201d\n\nSMART was launched as part of a national movement to put more accomplished STEM teachers in classrooms across the country to get students interested in those subjects.\n\nThrough 2018, the United States is projected to have 2.4 million STEM job openings, according to the Georgetown University\u2019s Center on Education and the Workforce.\n\nSchools are turning to STEM professionals who want to teach because the University of South Florida and other colleges of education aren\u2019t producing enough math and science teachers, said Larry Plank, Hillsborough\u2019s director of K-12 STEM education.\n\n\u201cWe get a lot of elementary teachers coming out of USF and not a lot of middle school math and science teachers,\u201d he said.\n\nIn 2011, President Barack Obama launched the \u201c100K in 10\u201d initiative, which aims to provide classrooms with 100,000 STEM teachers by 2021.\n\nHillsborough recently joined in, as one of seven school districts across the country, with the goal of training and retaining 3,000 effective K-12 STEM teachers.\n\nThe district replaces about 10 percent of its science and math teachers each year compared to the overall teacher replacement average of 5 percent, Plank said.\n\nTough as it is to keep STEM teachers, at least 90 percent of those who go through the SMART program stay after their first year of teaching.\n\nThe program allows teachers to become certified in one year as opposed to the two years it takes those who opt to gain certification through the traditional alternative certification track.\n\nSMART teachers also receive a $2,000 scholarship and are reimbursed for testing fees after three years of teaching. They also are paired up with a mentor for the first two years on the job.\n\nThose interested must submit an application and take a subject-area exam and general knowledge test, as well as a series of classes. Teachers are reimbursed for the test fees after three years of teaching.\n\nLast year, just 50 of the 220 people who attended eight SMART information sessions ended up applying to teach math or science in the district.\n\nTurkey Creek teacher Nesbitt said that\u2019s because the SMART program isn\u2019t for everyone. It takes time and a real drive to become a teacher.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very demanding,\u201d she said. \u201cOn top of learning the content and different ways of teaching it along the way, I\u2019m making significantly less than I was before.\u201d\n\nBut for Nesbitt, it\u2019s all been worth it. She says teaching is definitely the career for her.\n\n\u201cI love teaching and I love to interact with the kids.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sat, 08 Feb 2014 18:22:34 -0400", "Description": "A five-year Hillsborough program started in 2009 to recruit science, technology, engineering and math teachers, but finding candidates to complete the rigorous program has proven difficult.", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "A five-year Hillsborough program started in 2009 to recruit science, technology, engineering and math teachers, but finding candidates to complete the rigorous program has proven difficult.", "title": "Finding STEM teachers no easy task for Hillsborough program", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/news/education/finding-stem-teachers-no-easy-task-for-hillsborough-program-20140208/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140208/ARTICLE/140209379/EP/1/1/EP-140209379.jpg", "height": 462}, "updated_time": "2014-02-09T00:30:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "A five-year Hillsborough program started in 2009 to recruit science, technology, engineering and math teachers, but finding candidates to complete the rigorous program has proven difficult.", "title": "Finding STEM teachers no easy task for Hillsborough program", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140208/ARTICLE/140209379/AR/0/AR-140209379.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2014-02-08T18:22:34Z-04", "modified_time": "2014-02-09T00:30:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe4a32\"", "article_summary": "Now in its fifth and final year of recruiting, it has led to the hiring of just 100 STEM teachers.\nIn 2011, President Barack Obama launched the \u201c100K in 10\u201d initiative, which aims to provide classrooms with 100,000 STEM teachers by 2021.\n\u201cWe get a lot of elementary teachers coming out of USF and not a lot of middle school math and science teachers,\u201d he said.\nHillsborough recently joined in, as one of seven school districts across the country, with the goal of training and retaining 3,000 effective K-12 STEM teachers.\nTough as it is to keep STEM teachers, at least 90 percent of those who go through the SMART program stay after their first year of teaching."}
