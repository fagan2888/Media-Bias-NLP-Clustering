So a new study published in Schizophrenia Research suggests the illness be categorized as something else entirely.\n\nResearchers from the University of Verona (UV) in Italy, the Association for the Improvement of Mental Health Programs in Switzerland, and The Australian National University reviewed previously published literature on the issue of renaming schizophrenia, weighing the pros and cons of those changes. In total, there were 47 papers, and among them, researchers found the advantages outweighed the disadvantages. Renaming schizophrenia would \u201creduce stigma and benefit communication between clinicians, patients, and families.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe literature, from both Eastern and Western countries, consistently shows that the term schizophrenia holds a negative stigmatizing connotation,\u201d Dr. Antonio Lasalvia, lead study author of the department of public health and community medicine at UV, told The Daily Beast. \u201cThis negative connotation is a barrier for the recognition of the problem itself, for seeking specialized care, for taking full advantage of specialized care. It is therefore useless and sometimes damaging.\u201d\n\nThe Daily Beast reported of the words used to categorize mental illness, so many are used to connote \u201cbeing broken or disorganized.\u201d There are even those who use the term to generally refer to anything at all that seems insane, crazy, or unhinged. And for patients who are actually diagnosed with the disorder, they\u2019re afraid to say so for fear of others writing them off as a crazy.\n\nHowever, schizophrenia stems from problems with brain chemisty and structure, NAMI reported; it\u2019s a combination of genetic and environmental factors not unlike many other medical illness. Cognitive behavioral therapy has been shown to be particularly effective in treating schizophrenia patients, and psychosocial rehabilitations can help patients \u201csuccessfully live in independent housing, pursue education, find jobs, and improve social interaction.\u201d\n\nSchizophrenia wouldn\u2019t be the only mental illness to undergo a name change. Multiple personality disorder, for example, is now referred to as dissociative identity disorder. Lasalvia and his team added that while these changes reduce stigma, and ultimately better the state of mental health care, there need to also be \u201cparallel changes in legislation, services, and the education of professionals and the public.\u201d\n\nSource: Lasalvia A, et al.
