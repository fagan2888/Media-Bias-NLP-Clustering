The number who have lost their coverage could be even larger, though, as the reported number does not include immigrants who may have had similar problems in the state exchanges.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nThe eligibility rules give foreign-born residents a 95-day window to prove they are either legal residents or naturalized citizens during which time they are covered by Obamacare. But many are failing to clear up residency questions in the required time period and are therefore being kicked out of the program.\n\nAdvocates for the immigrants claim that most of those who have lost their Obamacare coverage are legal residents and should never have been forced out of the program.\n\nRepresentatives for the National Immigration Law Center (NILC) insist that illegals would not be engaging in the system, so, they reason that those losing their coverage must be legal if they were risking alerting authorities to their status.\n\n\u201cSomebody who is trying to submit documents over and over \u2026 is someone who believes they have an eligible immigration status,\u201d an NILC representative said.\n\nAdvocates also claim that many who are losing their coverage are confused by the requirements and don\u2019t understand just what paperwork they need to turn in and that the government is providing little help in clearing up those questions.\n\n\u201cIf it was clearer what the consumer needed to do, we wouldn\u2019t have the numbers that we have,\u201d the NILC representative said.\n\nAnother factor in the suddenly widespread loss of coverage, advocates say, is that the government wasn\u2019t imposing the strict rules in the last few years, allowing immigrants to stay on insurance for a longer period of time, far past the 95-day limit. But now the time limits are being more strictly enforced.\n\nEarlier this year, another 200,000 immigrants lost their Obamacare coverage because they couldn\u2019t prove legal residency. This is in addition to the 112,000 who lost coverage for the same reason in 2014.\n\nDetractors of Obamacare point out that these numbers make it clear that hundreds of thousands of illegal residents were getting Obamacare coverage despite that they didn\u2019t qualify for it.\n\nWorse, they say that the $3,000 penalty for legal employees encourages employers to hire illegals to avoid the fee compounding the problem.\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "New rules on Obamacare eligibility have caused up to 400,000 immigrants to lose the coverage they thought they had under the healthcare law.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "New rules on Obamacare eligibility have caused up to 400,000 immigrants to lose the coverage they thought they had under the healthcare law.", "title": "400,000 Immigrants Lose Obamacare Coverage They Had Last Year", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/06/Obamacare-AP-Photo.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/09/13/400000-immigrants-lose-obamacare-coverage-they-had-last-year/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "New rules on Obamacare eligibility have caused up to 400,000 immigrants to lose the coverage they thought they had under the healthcare law.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/06/Obamacare-AP-Photo.jpg", "title": "400,000 Immigrants Lose Obamacare Coverage They Had Last Year", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Health Coverage, health insurance, Immigrants,Big Government, Immigration, Obamacare,Obamacare", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "Immigrants", "published_time": "2015-09-13T13:57:02-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,Immigration,Obamacare"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "Earlier this year, another 200,000 immigrants lost their Obamacare coverage because they couldn\u2019t prove legal residency.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERNew rules governing Obamacare eligibility have caused up to 400,000 immigrants to lose the coverage they thought they had under the President\u2019s healthcare law, a new report says.\nAdvocates for the immigrants claim that most of those who have lost their Obamacare coverage are legal residents and should never have been forced out of the program.\nDetractors of Obamacare point out that these numbers make it clear that hundreds of thousands of illegal residents were getting Obamacare coverage despite that they didn\u2019t qualify for it.\nThis is in addition to the 112,000 who lost coverage for the same reason in 2014."}
