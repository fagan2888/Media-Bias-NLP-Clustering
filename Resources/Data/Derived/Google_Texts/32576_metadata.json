It\u2019s a music venue that has great food, that has great cocktails, and we only want to do promoted shows.\u201d\n\nDark nights at The Capitol have been few and far between since the venue opened its doors in late November, and they\u2019re getting rarer still. Already the venue, located in downtown underneath Patagonia, Bishop\u2019s Barber Shop and Wild Rose Thai restaurant, has launched two themed Thursdays \u2014 the throwback Electroswing party on the second Thursday of every month, and \u201980s Night on the third Thursday of every month.\n\nLocal favorite Jive Coulis kicked off live music at the venue Dec. 5. This past weekend saw Colorado folk duo The Good Time Travelers play the venue Friday night, followed by an electronic house music showcase from Beat Lab Radio on Saturday. The Capitol will gear up for its biggest show yet Thursday: Larry and His Flask\u2019s traditional New Year\u2019s Eve show.\n\nThe local folk-punk mainstays are bringing the show back after a quiet year with only three gigs, including headlining slots at Crawfest and the Bend Summer Festival this summer. It even skipped the New Year\u2019s Eve show last year.\n\n\u201cThis year we decided to make it happen again, and we heard about (The Capitol),\u201d bassist Jeshua Marshall said. \u201cWe found out about it and checked it out. We had an offer from the Old Stone Church and from The Capitol, and we kind of thought it would be cool to try out a new spot since we had done it at the Old Stone Church in the past. They\u2019ve been really cool to work with so far, so we\u2019re excited to do it up.\u201d\n\nThe show, which also features California folkies Willy Tea Taylor and Tom Vandenavond, will kick off a much more active year for LAHF. The band is planning a cross-country tour out to Florida in the spring and a European tour in the summer. Marshall said the band also hopes to begin recording a new album, its first since 2013\u2019s \u201cBy the Lamplight,\u201d when not on the road. Additionally, the band\u2019s members are active around town in side projects Woebegone and Guardian of the Underdog.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re definitely \u2014 we\u2019re going back at it, but we\u2019re going at it at a more relaxed pace, not full-time touring mode,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll ever return to that mode. We\u2019re just stoked to be playing music together again.\u201d\n\nAnd like many local musicians and promoters, Marshall and the rest of the band are excited about a new, mid-sized music venue in town (The Capitol can hold about 300 people in its concert space, a room off to the side of the main bar and restaurant).\n\n\u201cI think we do need it, especially to have something downtown that helps bring a crowd out,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cThere\u2019s just not a lot of options. \u2026 It\u2019s cool that there\u2019s a new spot, and it seems like they\u2019re kind of catering to the whole dance club kind of scene, but also working live music into it, which is cool. I think any kind of growth like that for Bend is good; it\u2019s always kind of a struggle to keep live music going here because of people complaining about the noise, or people not wanting that kind of image, I guess, for Bend.\u201d\n\nLongtime music scene followers know opening a music venue in this city isn\u2019t always easy. In June 2013 the city lost a key venue in the Horned Hand; in 2007 live music venue and restaurant The Grove shut its doors. Those are just two examples.\n\nDay and Edgell, however, are confident The Capitol\u2019s mix of high-end cocktails, food and promoted events, plus its prime location in downtown, will help it avoid some of the pitfalls of venues past.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always talked about it, we\u2019re kind of the trifecta: We have dinner to start off with, we have the bar that\u2019s always going to make us money, and then the icing on the cake is the music venue,\u201d Edgell said. \u201cSo (we\u2019re) trying to basically fill every open minute with something to be profitable, and just stay viable as a business so that we can continue to bring live music to (Bend).\u201d\n\nThe owners both have experience in the hospitality and promotion businesses. Day moved to Bend about four years ago, and has worked in the restaurant business for 20 years. Edgell, a Bend resident since 1998, has worked in concessions for the Les Schwab Amphitheater, as well as with the theater\u2019s production company, Portland-based Monqui Presents.\n\nOriginally the two had planned to open The Capitol this summer, but their application with the city, filed in December of last year, wasn\u2019t approved until March. Renovations complicated the matter; at one point construction workers found a large slab of bedrock under the room when trying to dig out a plumbing trench. It cost an extra $40,000 to have it removed, Edgell said.\n\nThe entrance on Oregon Avenue opens on a stairway leading down into the basement of the building, where The Capitol is situated. The venue is named for the Capitol Theatre, a historic theater open from 1922 to 1955 in downtown on the corner of Wall Street and Greenwood Avenue, where Bank of America is today.\n\nThe Capitol\u2019s bar, created from reclaimed floor joists, is the first thing customers see when they walk in, along with large-screen TVs playing old horror and sci-fi films. The dining room is off to the right, along with an assortment of old-school arcade games such as \u201cPac-Man\u201d lining the side wall.\n\nThe live music space is to the left, cordoned off with a series of closet doors. The back wall of the space is covered in old tin tiles that were found in the building. The stage \u2014 which made its debut Friday \u2014 sits at an angle, commanding a view of the entire room.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a temporary stage, but it\u2019s going to be more permanent than temporary (in that it) will be movable, depending on the act, the size of the acts and depending on the show,\u201d Day said.\n\nResponse to the venue so far has been strong, according to Edgell. Stacy Totland, founder of the 4 Peaks Music Festival and promoter of The Good Time Travelers show last Friday, said she\u2019s looking forward to bringing more shows to the venue in the fall, spring and winter months.\n\n\u201cI think (The Capitol) is in line with what Bend could thrive on, not only with good, sustainable, tasty food and beverages, but just as a good-sized music venue for live music,\u201d Totland said. \u201c\u2026 I still think we need a larger indoor venue, which is something some of us always harp on, but (The Capitol) does fill a niche of a different kind of venue, a different vibe, different kinds of crowds, good food.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe town was lacking, for sure,\u201d Edgell said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of local acts that haven\u2019t had time to shine in something a little bit bigger. We\u2019ve got Larry and His Flask for New Year\u2019s Eve; they\u2019re a pretty big band, but I think the intimate space here is gonna be really fun for them and fun for us and all the people that are coming to enjoy the show.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Reporter: 541-617-7814, bmcelhiney@bendbulletin.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sean Day and Nate Edgell, co-owners of Bend\u2019s newest restaurant/music venue, The Capitol, are adamant: Any show at the venue will be an event. \u201cThat\u2019s the biggest thing that we\u2019ve had a lot of questions about,\u201d Day said recently while working on some last-minute stage construction in the newly opened venue. \u201cPeople would come down on Friday night, we wouldn\u2019t have anything going on, and they\u2019d be like, \u2018Oh, I thought this was a dance", "og": {"site_name": "The Bulletin", "description": "Sean Day and Nate Edgell, co-owners of Bend\u2019s newest restaurant/music venue, The Capitol, are adamant: Any show at the venue will be an event. \u201cThat\u2019s the biggest thing that we\u2019ve had a lot of questions about,\u201d Day said recently while working on some last-minute stage construction in the newly opened venue. \u201cPeople would come down on Friday night, we wouldn\u2019t have anything going on, and they\u2019d be like, \u2018Oh, I thought this was a dance", "title": "Larry and His Flask kicks off new year at The Capitol", "url": "http://www.bendbulletin.com/entertainment/3831822-151/larry-and-his-flask-kicks-off-new-year", "image": "http://www.bendbulletin.com/csp/mediapool/sites/dt.common.streams.StreamServer.cls?STREAMOID=11gNHCwKIo8D$43IxU3gZ8$daE2N3K4ZzOUsqbU5sYuyKXraUQ$ZhoycFHZvXN4YWCsjLu883Ygn4B49Lvm9bPe2QeMKQdVeZmXF$9l$4uCZ8QDXhaHEp3rvzXRJFdy0KqPHLoMevcTLo3h8xh70Y6N_U_CryOsw6FTOdKL_jpQ-&CONTENTTYPE=image/jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@thebulletin", "image": {"src": "http://www.bendbulletin.com/csp/mediapool/sites/dt.common.streams.StreamServer.cls?STREAMOID=11gNHCwKIo8D$43IxU3gZ8$daE2N3K4ZzOUsqbU5sYuyKXraUQ$ZhoycFHZvXN4YWCsjLu883Ygn4B49Lvm9bPe2QeMKQdVeZmXF$9l$4uCZ8QDXhaHEp3rvzXRJFdy0KqPHLoMevcTLo3h8xh70Y6N_U_CryOsw6FTOdKL_jpQ-&CONTENTTYPE=image/jpeg"}, "description": "Sean Day and Nate Edgell, co-owners of Bend\u2019s newest restaurant/music venue, The Capitol, are adamant: Any show at the venue will be an event. \u201cThat\u2019s the biggest thing that we\u2019ve had a lot of questions about,\u201d Day said recently while working on some last-minute stage construction in the newly opened venue. \u201cPeople would come down on Friday night, we wouldn\u2019t have anything going on, and they\u2019d be like, \u2018Oh, I thought this was a dance", "card": "summary", "title": "Larry and His Flask kicks off new year at The Capitol"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#035CB6", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://statics.bendbulletin.com/images/thebulletin_retro_nav_small.png/images/bb-windows-tile.png", "__sync_contentCategory": "pw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "In June 2013 the city lost a key venue in the Horned Hand; in 2007 live music venue and restaurant The Grove shut its doors.\nThe live music space is to the left, cordoned off with a series of closet doors.\nLocal favorite Jive Coulis kicked off live music at the venue Dec. 5.\n\u201cI think (The Capitol) is in line with what Bend could thrive on, not only with good, sustainable, tasty food and beverages, but just as a good-sized music venue for live music,\u201d Totland said.\nThe Capitol will gear up for its biggest show yet Thursday: Larry and His Flask\u2019s traditional New Year\u2019s Eve show."}
