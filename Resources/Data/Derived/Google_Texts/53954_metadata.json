The decrease came despite record numbers of refugees fleeing to Europe last year from conflict in Syria and Africa.\n\nEurostat couldn\u2019t say whether the cause was fewer migrants arriving in the EU, fewer Europeans emigrating, more migrants returning home, or a combination of these and other factors. The uncertainty arises from the fact that the methodology Eurostat uses subtracts the \u201cnatural change\u201d of the population (births minus deaths) from the overall population figure, the remainder being net migration.\n\nThe final migration figures for 2013, which will be calculated after emigration and immigration figures have been collected for all EU member states, will be available at the end of 2014, a spokeswoman for Eurostat said.\n\nTwo tiny EU countries that share a knack for banking services displayed particularly interesting demographic trends last year.\n\nLuxembourg\u2019s population (estimated this year at 549,700) grew most across the 28-member bloc, by 2.3%. That was propelled by a 0.42% increase in the \u201cnatural\u201d population (births minus deaths) and a 1.9% increase in net migration, the biggest in the EU.\n\nThe picture in Cyprus (population estimate 858,000, not counting those living in the Turkish-occupied north of the island) was very different. While Cypriots got busy having babies, boosting the natural change by 0.47%, net migration fell 1.39% \u2014 the biggest drop across the EU. So, despite the procreative fervor, the Republic of Cyprus\u2019s population shrunk by 0.9%.\n\nWe have unpicked some other interesting statistics from the survey:\n\nThe highest birth rates were recorded in Ireland (1.5%) and four EU countries with major immigrant populations: France (1.23%); the U.K. (1.22%); Sweden (1.18%) and Luxembourg (1.13%). Higher birth rates are observed in migrant communities in Europe.\n\nwere recorded in Ireland (1.5%) and four EU countries with major immigrant populations: France (1.23%); the U.K. (1.22%); Sweden (1.18%) and Luxembourg (1.13%). Higher birth rates are observed in migrant communities in Europe. In the crisis-hit South of Europe \u2013and in Germany- people were less keen to procreate. The lowest birth rate was recorded in Portugal (0.79%) while Germany, Greece and Italy saw the second-lowest (0.85%).\n\nwas recorded in Portugal (0.79%) while Germany, Greece and Italy saw the second-lowest (0.85%). The highest death rates were seen in the bloc\u2019s poorest countries \u2013the sad first going to Bulgaria (1.44%). The lowest death rate seems to confirm the theory that a Mediterranean diet can lead to a very long life: Cyprus recorded the lowest death rate (0.6%).\n\n[You can find the full flash estimate for 2013 here; to compare, see the 2012 release here]", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "The early reading of last year's population trends in the EU by Eurostat is packed full of interesting facts, including a dramatic drop in net migration from the year before.", "title": "EU Net Migration Shrank By A Quarter in 2013, Eurostat Says", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/brussels/2014/07/10/eu-net-migration-shrank-by-a-quarter-in-2013-eurostat-says/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "World", "article.headline": "EU Net Migration Shrank By A Quarter in 2013, Eurostat Says", "description": "The early reading of last year's population trends in the EU by Eurostat is packed full of interesting facts, including a dramatic drop in net migration from the year before.", "article_section": "World", "author": "Matina Stevis", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Real Time Brussels Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Real Time Brussels", "article.summary": "The early reading of last year's population trends in the EU by Eurostat is packed full of interesting facts, including a dramatic drop in net migration from the year before.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-07-10T12:22:58-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-143", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/brussels/2014/07/10/eu-net-migration-shrank-by-a-quarter-in-2013-eurostat-says/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-RTBB-4439", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "World", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "The early reading of last year's population trends in the EU by Eurostat is packed full of interesting facts, including a dramatic drop in net migration from the year before.", "title": "EU Net Migration Shrank By A Quarter in 2013, Eurostat Says", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/brussels/2014/07/10/eu-net-migration-shrank-by-a-quarter-in-2013-eurostat-says/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Real Time Brussels", "article.id": "BL-RTBB-4439", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-07-10T12:23:46-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd489b\"", "article_summary": "In 2012 net migration in the EU was 882,200 people; last year the figure stood at 653,100.\nWhile Cypriots got busy having babies, boosting the natural change by 0.47%, net migration fell 1.39% \u2014 the biggest drop across the EU.\nTwo tiny EU countries that share a knack for banking services displayed particularly interesting demographic trends last year.\nThat was propelled by a 0.42% increase in the \u201cnatural\u201d population (births minus deaths) and a 1.9% increase in net migration, the biggest in the EU.\nNet migration (meaning arrivals of migrants minus emigration of locals) in the European Union shrunk by a dramatic 25% in 2013 compared to the year before, preliminary figures collected by Eurostat and released Thursday showed."}
