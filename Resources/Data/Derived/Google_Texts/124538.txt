State Treasurer John Kennedy announced that he will be running for his current office again, ending years of speculation that he would jump in the race for governor or attorney general this cycle.

"It's not easy to muster the courage and political will to make the tough choices needed to get our budget under control, but I'll continue to challenge our leadership in state government and the federal government to confront those choices head on and stop the wasteful spending that burdens our taxpayers," Kennedy said.

A few people, including House Speaker Chuck Kleckley, had said they were interested in running for state treasurer if Kennedy did not seek reelection. \

Kennedy has more campaign cash on hand that most other statewide candidates, including most running for governor. He closed out 2014 with $3.5 million in his campaign account.
