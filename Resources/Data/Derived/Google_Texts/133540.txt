With apologies to Yogi Berra, you can see a lot just by looking up — and so it is with the giant pencil rising above the University Building at the corner of Champa and 16th streets.

The pencil was recently singled out in the annual Mayor’s Design Awards 2014, nabbing honors in the Distinctive Denver category.

But the pencil’s history, in some ways, goes back before World War I. The University Building was constructed in 1910 and ready for occupancy on Jan. 1, 1911. The “pencil” was originally a rather nondescript smokestack that vented the three coal-fired boilers that heated the 12-story structure.

“It had kind of been this gray presence forever,” says David Kaufman, the property manager and co-owner of the building with Naiman Partners-910 Associates. “In conjunction with the renovation of the building’s ground floor, we thought we’d create a new presence there.”



And so they did. A design firm and contractors transformed the gray smokestack into a dead ringer for a classic No. 2 pencil — familiar to any schoolkid who ever took a test — right down to an eraser, coat of yellow paint, and the “University Bldg.” written in lettering that resembles classic pencil-brand logos such as Dixon and Venus.

The smokestack sort of hides in plain sight. It’s not visible from the 16th Street Mall, but you can spot it as you walk up 15th Street from Larimer Square — if you’re looking up. Check it out.
