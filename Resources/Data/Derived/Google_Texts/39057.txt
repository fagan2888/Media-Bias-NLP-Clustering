Polish citizens no longer need a visa to travel to Turkey. Turkey’s Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu announced the visa policy change on Dec. 8 during a two-day visit to Warsaw. Davutoğlu explained that the government had done away with the visa requirement to “boost interaction” between Turkey and Poland. In return, Poland’s Prime Minister Ewa Kopacz promised to increase flights between the two countries and to support Turkey in its visa liberalization agreement with the European Union, which should result in visa-free EU travel for Turkish citizens starting in 2016. Poland has been a member of the EU since 2004.
