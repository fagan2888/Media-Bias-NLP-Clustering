DENVER (MainStreet) — When new regulations for packaging edibles went into effect this month, infused-product manufacturer Dixie Elixirs pulled its signature sodas out of dispensaries.

The company has been working on developing a new to comply with the Colorado mandate that all packaging for edibles be child resistant. For beverages, manufacturers also must provide a one-dose measuring cup with the product.

Dixie has spend several hundred thousand dollars developing a package that has the measuring cup integrated into the child-resistant lid, said Joe Hodas, Dixie’s chief marketing officer.

“There are some solutions that would have worked for a non-carbonated beverage, so we went about the process of inventing on,” Hodas said. “They do not make a resealable child-resistant bottle that holds carbonation.”

The company also has developed Dixie Lift, a single-serving one-ounce drink the size of an energy beverage.

Under Colorado law, child-resistant is defined as packaging that is designed or constructed to be significantly difficult for children younger than five to open and not difficult for normal adults to use properly. The law also requires packaging to be opaque so that the product cannot be seen without opening it. The packaging also must be resealable for any product intended for more than a single use or containing multiple servings.

The state has officially set the serving size of active THC in each edible marijuana product at ten milligrams. It also has set the maximum serving size of an individual marijuana product at 100 milligrams of THC. The rules also require edibles to be capable of being easily separated into a delineation that matches the serving size amount. For instance, if a chocolate bar contains ten serving sizes in a single product, it mast have indents that allow it to be easily broken into ten pieces.
