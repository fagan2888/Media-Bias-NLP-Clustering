"This is the truth from the very beginning," Spacey responded, looking directly at the camera and dropping into character Frank Underwood's Southern drawl.

"When I'm looking directly into that camera, I'm talking to one person and one person only â€” and that is Donald Trump," Spacey said.

"Now it all starts to make sense," Spacey added to Colbert.

The star of the Netflix political drama, which first aired in 2013, made the remarks on the same night Trump appeared alongside 10 other candidates for the second GOP presidential debate.
