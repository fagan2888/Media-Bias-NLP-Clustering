Wendy Lippman, a captain with the Aurora Fire Department, said the officer was looking in an alcove between two buildings and found the device, which had been packed with shrapnel.\n\nLippman said an undisclosed number of suspects tried to detonate the bomb outside the middle school at 6:30 p.m. Saturday but were unsuccessful. Investigators believe that had the bomb been properly detonated, it could have caused significant damage.\n\nSurveillance video showed the individuals trying to light the device on fire, officials said.\n\n\u201cThey have very good video of the suspects,\u201d Lippman said, adding that no other devices were found.\n\nLaw enforcement was working with school officials to identify and contact those in the video, she said. Investigators did not release details about those involved in the attempted detonation.\n\n\u201cAs a precaution, we have evacuated the building,\u201d said Georgia Duran, a spokeswoman for Aurora Public Schools.\n\nDuran said officials moved the students to Rangeview High School and then dismissed them for the day. Classes will resume Tuesday.\n\nAurora and Denver police, the Arapahoe County Sheriff\u2019s Office and the Aurora Fire Department searched the building. No injuries were reported.\n\nJesse Paul: 303-954-1733, jpaul@denverpost.com or twitter.com/jesseapaul", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Mrachek Middle School in Aurora evacuated after pipe bomb found", "title": "Mrachek Middle School in Aurora evacuated after pipe bomb found", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/11/mrachek-middle-school-in-aurora-evacuated-after-pipe-bomb-found/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140811__Mrachek-Middle-Schoolp1.jpg", "height": 480}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140811__Mrachek-Middle-Schoolp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-11T10:06:01+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T07:54:42+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The search began about 9 a.m. at Mrachek Middle School on the 1900 block of South Telluride Street after a school resource officer found the bomb.\nAURORA \u2014 Hundreds of students at a middle school were evacuated Monday after authorities found the remnants of a pipe bomb, leading them to search for other explosives.\nLippman said an undisclosed number of suspects tried to detonate the bomb outside the middle school at 6:30 p.m. Saturday but were unsuccessful.\nLaw enforcement was working with school officials to identify and contact those in the video, she said.\nAurora and Denver police, the Arapahoe County Sheriff\u2019s Office and the Aurora Fire Department searched the building."}
