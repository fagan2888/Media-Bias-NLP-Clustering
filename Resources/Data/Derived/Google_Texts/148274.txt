Minneapolis, MN

Dash cam video captures the moment a Minnesota State Trooper catches up to an 8-year-old boy out on a joy ride.

He had made it nearly 20 miles, taking 35 E to a Mounds View neighborhood. The boy eventually turns into a driveway and the trooper pulls up behind him.

At first the boy puts the car in reverse and hits the squad car before parking. The trooper gets out and checks to see what's going on.

The boy eventually gets out of his car, wearing pajamas. He takes out his backpack and a bag with his belongings. Then, his 5-year-old foster sister and her 3-year-old brother also get out of the car. The three of them leave with the trooper, unharmed.

All three children were returned to their foster family. It's still unknown why the boy took off or or where he planned to drive.
