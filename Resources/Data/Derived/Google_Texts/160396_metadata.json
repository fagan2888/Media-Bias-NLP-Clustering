Jerry Brown signed landmark legislation last October that would allow terminally ill people to request life-ending medication from their physicians.\n\nBut no one knew when the law would take effect, because of the unusual way in which the law was passed \u2014 in a legislative \u201cextraordinary session\u201d called by Gov. Brown. The bill could not go into effect until 90 days after the session adjourned.\n\nThat was this morning, after the Senate sent new tobacco regulations to the governor\u2019s desk and means the \u201cEnd of Life Option Act\u201d will go into effect June 9.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re glad to finally have arrived at this day where we have a date certain,\u201d said Sen. Bill Monning, D-Carmel, in an interview.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a historic achievement for California, and for a limited universe of people dealing with a terminal illness, it could indeed be a transformative way of giving them the option of a compassionate end-of-life process.\u201d\n\nDisability-rights advocates fought hard last year against passage of the act and continue to voice concern.\n\nGolden said it\u2019s impossible to know if a depressed patient went to many doctors who all denied the request for lethal medication before finding one who agreed to write the prescription.\n\n\u201cWe are looking ahead at measures to protect people from abuse,\u201d said Marilyn Golden, senior policy analyst with the Disability Rights Education & Defense Fund, \u201cand to explore and inform doctors, nurses and pharmacists that they don\u2019t have to participate.\u201d\n\nAs written, the law requires two doctors to agree that a patient has six months or less to live before prescribing the drugs. Patients must be able to swallow the medication themselves and must affirm in writing 48 hours before taking the medication that they will do so.\n\nCalifornia is the fifth state to permit this end of life option. It joins Vermont, Oregon, Washington and Montana.\n\nAcross the state, some patients with advanced cancer welcomed the news.\n\n\u201cIt gives me a great peace of mind to know that I will not be forced to die slowly and painfully,\u201d said Elizabeth Wallner, in a release from Compassion & Choices, an advocacy group. Wallner, 52, of Sacramento, is a single mother with stage IV colon cancer that has spread to her liver and lungs.\n\n\u201cIt gives great comfort to know that the agonizingly traumatic image of me suffering will not be my family\u2019s last memory of me,\u201d she said.\n\nSen. Monning expressed his gratitude to people who worked for passage of the law, some in their final days:\n\nBrittany Maynard , an Orange County woman with brain cancer who moved to Oregon to take advantage of aid-in-dying there. Before she died, she recorded a video that was shown during hearings on the \u201cEnd of Life Option Act\u201d in Sacramento\n\n, an Orange County woman with brain cancer who moved to Oregon to take advantage of aid-in-dying there.
