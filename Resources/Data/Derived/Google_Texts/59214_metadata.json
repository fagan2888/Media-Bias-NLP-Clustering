Clapper described on Sunday his recent secret mission to North Korea to bring home Americans Kenneth Bae and Matthew Miller.\n\nMr. Clapper said on \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on CBS that he was \u201cquite apprehensive\u201d during his trip to Pyongyang to secure the prisoners\u2019 release, The Hill reported.\n\n\u201cI personally was not completely confident that we would actually \u2026 that they would actually release our two citizens, and so yes, it was apprehensive,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, from a personal standpoint, it\u2019s kind of always been on my professional bucket list, you know, to visit North Korea, so I did get to do that.\u201d\n\nMr. Clapper said it was the first time he had been to North Korea \u201cwith permission\u201d from the government. He had previously traveled into North Korean airspace aboard a U.S. helicopter in December 1985.\n\n\u201cThey shot at us, and fortunately we made it back to the South,\u201d he said of that previous trip.\n\nMr. Clapper said North Korean officials were disappointed that there was no diplomatic \u201cbreakthrough\u201d in relations as a result of releasing the two Americans.\n\nHe described an unpleasant dinner he had during the trip with the head of the Reconnaissance Guidance Bureau, who reinforced his belief that North Korea \u201cfeels itself to be under siege,\u201d The Hill reported.\n\n\u201cThere is a certain institutional paranoia, and that was certainly reflected in a lot of things that he said,\u201d Mr. Clapper said. \u201cFor example, allegations about our exercises that we conduct in the Republic of Korea. They did bring up the human rights issue at one point, although we were well into the dialogue. Criticizing us for our interventionist approach, our interventionist policies into their internal matters. So it was that sort of dialogue back and forth. It wasn\u2019t exactly a pleasant dinner.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Director of National Intelligence James R.
