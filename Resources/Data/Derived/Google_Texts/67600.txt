Exhibit on portrait photographer continues into August

hello

Local residents discussed photographic portraits Sunday at the Lake County Discovery Museum near Wauconda during a members-only tour of "Arnold Newman: Luminaries."

The program was led by Lake County museum educator Seleena Kuester, who educated the group on portrait photographer Newman and the famous people he photographed.

"The whole point of the tour was learning how to read and analyze Newman's photographs," explained Kuester, "and what do they tell us about the subjects."

The members discussed with Kuester the intricacies of Newman's work and the relationship between subjects and their surroundings.

"It's a great way to showcase the photographer and the people he photographed," said Kathy Maynard of Deerfield.

The show runs through Aug. 17.
