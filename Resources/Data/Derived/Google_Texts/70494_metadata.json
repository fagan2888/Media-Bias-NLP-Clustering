The look was topped by sleek, pulled-back hair and white diamond De Grisogono earrings.\n\nPortman has received lukewarm reviews for the film, a handsomely mounted tale of a young boy coming of age in the newly formed Israeli state in the late 1940s. Portman plays the boy's sensitive, imaginative mother in the film, adapted from a novel by Amos Oz.\n\n\u2014By Jill Lawless, http://Twitter.com/JillLawless", "article_metadata": {"description": "CANNES WATCH: Natalie Portman dazzles in Dior - AP News: CANNES, France (AP) \u2014 Natalie Portman is at home on .05/26/2016 18:20:43PM EST.", "author": "AP News", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "CANNES, France (AP) \u2014 Natalie Portman is at home on the Cannes red carpet, but", "title": "AP News - CANNES WATCH: Natalie Portman dazzles in Dior", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/world/2015/05/16/cannes-watch-natalie-portman-dazzles-in-dior-n1999957", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015\\136\\9e69190f-f382-4b70-9189-1cef153739d4.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "CANNES, France (AP) \u2014 Natalie Portman is at home on the Cannes red carpet, but", "title": "AP News - CANNES WATCH: Natalie Portman dazzles in Dior", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/world/2015/05/16/cannes-watch-natalie-portman-dazzles-in-dior-n1999957", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/136/9e69190f-f382-4b70-9189-1cef153739d4.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "CANNES WATCH: Natalie Portman dazzles in Dior, AP News, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "CANNES, France (AP) \u2014 Natalie Portman is at home on the Cannes red carpet, but her appearance Saturday was her first as director as well as star.\nPortman wrote, directed and stars in the Hebrew-language festival entry \"A Tale of Love and Darkness.\"\nPortman plays the boy's sensitive, imaginative mother in the film, adapted from a novel by Amos Oz.\nShe wore an elegant dress from Dior Couture's spring-summer 2015 collection with an A-line skirt in black-patterned pale blue silk and a black strapless bodice.\nPortman has received lukewarm reviews for the film, a handsomely mounted tale of a young boy coming of age in the newly formed Israeli state in the late 1940s."}
