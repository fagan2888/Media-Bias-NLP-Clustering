Her mother is Mexican. (Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call)\n\nPresident Barack Obama may be just about done with this Congress, but there\u2019s one thing he can\u2019t do without \u2014 money.\n\nBefore Congress adjourns in a month for the August recess, Obama wants lawmakers to pass a supplemental spending bill dealing primarily with the child migrant crisis , while also averting a slowdown of highway projects.\n\nBut he will need a historically unproductive Congress to creak into action to do so, even as House Republicans head to the courthouse to sue the president over his executive actions.\n\nAnd after the break, Congress will have to agree on a spending bill to avoid a pre-election government shutdown \u2014 with Obama pushing Congress for a host of controversial items, including $500 million for Syrian rebels, a new anti-terrorism foreign aid fund and the authority to close the military prison in Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba.\n\nThe bottom line: While Obama has used his pen and phone to enact a host of administrative changes this year, he can\u2019t pen and phone his way around Congress\u2019 power of the purse. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters the administration would detail its supplemental spending request Tuesday and said the measure would include a surge of personnel to adjudicate border migrant cases and other items.\n\nEarnest has expressed hope that Congress could act quickly to provide both the funding and new authorities for Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson so the administration can quickly process and, in most cases, deport the children to their home countries in Central America.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear yet whether Congress would approve anything \u2014 or if the White House will have to swallow any riders or offsetting budget cuts Republicans might demand in return. GOP aides held their fire Monday ahead of the official request.\n\nBut Sen. John McCain suggested that an immigration overhaul was impossible until the border was secure , and said the United States should pressure Central American countries and Mexico to stop the flow.\n\n\"We should tell these countries in Central America that no more aid, no more assistance, no nothing until they stop this from happening,\u201d the Arizona Republican told KFYI radio in Phoenix. \u201cAnd tell our friends in Mexico to secure their border, their Southern border as well as their Northern border, and no comprehensive immigration reform until we get our border secured. It\u2019s unacceptable.\"\n\nOther Republicans have blamed the border crisis, in part, on the president\u2019s decision to unilaterally grant deportation relief to many immigrants brought to the United States as children.\n\nThe House already has voted to defund that program, known as DACA, and some Republicans recently wrote to Obama demanding he immediately end the program.\n\nThe White House has strongly rejected the GOP argument, and with chances of an immigration overhaul dead for the year , Obama is looking to expand deportation relief on his own, not shrink it \u2014 even as the administration emphasizes changes would not apply to new immigrants.\n\nIt's all rubbing Republicans the wrong way.\n\n\"In the same breath, at that moment when he asked for more money to take care of the crisis, he announced that he would deliberately and openly go around the Congress of the United States and the Constitution and unilaterally change immigration law again through an enforcement policy,\" Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., said Monday on the floor.\n\nBut even Sessions suggested Congress will need to find some money to deal with the crisis.\n\n\"We've got to take care of the children. We can't leave them in a circumstance where they're not fed or taken care of or in safe condition. We'll have to find some money, I guess, to do that. But the question is: how did it happen? Why did it happen?\u201d\n\nSessions also told CQ Roll Call any new spending should be offset: \u201cI don\u2019t think the president should be rewarded for his failures by just having us borrow more money to just pay for that.\u201d\n\nSessions suggested raising $4.2 billion to fund the program by making it harder for people in the country illegally to claim the Additional Child Tax Credit. His proposal would require a Social Security number to claim the benefit, cutting out those who have U.S. citizen children but aren't authorized to be here.\n\nSen. Richard C. Shelby, R-Ala., the ranking member on appropriations, said of the request \"absolutely it ought to be offset.\" He suggested starting with rescissions from the Affordable Care Act.\n\nSessions called the president's position a \"disconnect,\" noting he views it as \"ironic that he demands Congress provide him money while the money he\u2019s demanding is needed because of his failure to enforce congressionally passed law.\"\n\nSessions suggested House Republicans could attach to Obama's funding request conditions that would require the administration to enforce current immigration law to access the funds.\n\nThe supplemental request will get a hearing Thursday in the Senate Appropriations Committee.\n\nThe push for offsets comes as Congress is grappling with how to pay for a roughly $10 billion patch to avert a shutdown of highway projects across the country, while giving Congress more time to hash out a longer-term solution.\n\nThen there\u2019s the potential for a September shutdown showdown. Republican leaders haven\u2019t shown any appetite for a reprise of last year\u2019s partial government closure drama, which ended when the GOP capitulated on demands to defund Obamacare.\n\nJohn Thune of South Dakota, the No. 3 Senate Republican, said recently Republicans weren\u2019t plotting to shut down the government over the president\u2019s coal regulations, for example .\n\nAs he cranks into action ahead of the Nov. 4 midterm elections, Obama has been increasingly dismissive of the Capitol\u2019s dysfunction, blaming Republican partisan politics while saying he\u2019s ready to work with the GOP if they're willing to work with him.\n\nBut his relationship with Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio is at a low point, given the House GOP lawsuit and the speaker's refusal to bring an immigration bill to the floor. The president brushed off the lawsuit threat with a \u201cso sue me\u201d line, and also has dismissed the idea that golfing more with Boehner would accomplish anything.\n\nNiels Lesniewski and Humberto Sanchez contributed to this report.\n\nRelated stories: Boehner Moving Toward Late-July Vote on Obama Lawsuit White House: Boehner Lawsuit Uses Taxpayer Money Against Obama for 'Doing His Job' Boehner Planning House Lawsuit Against Obama Executive Actions Boehner\u2019s Memo to Members on Obama Lawsuit 33 House Republicans to Obama: End Deportation Stays for \u2018Dreamers\u2019 Obama Executive Order to Ban LGBT Discrimination Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call in your inbox or on your iPhone.", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Barack Obama may be just about done with this Congress, but there\u2019s one thing he can\u2019t do without \u2014 money.", "og": {"site_name": "Roll Call", "description": "President Barack Obama may be just about done with this Congress, but there\u2019s one thing he can\u2019t do without \u2014 money.", "title": "Obama Still Needs Congress to Show Him the Money", "url": "http://www.rollcall.com/news/home/immigration-news-obama-needs-congress-emergency-funding", "image": {"identifier": "http://cdn.videos.rollcall.com/blogs/sites/16/2014/07/immigration009_070714-445x299.jpg", "type": "image/png"}, "updated_time": "2014-08-26T20:25:28Z", "type": "website"}, "abstract": "President Barack Obama may be just about done with this Congress, but there\u2019s one thing he can\u2019t do without \u2014 money.", "fb": {"app_id": 1383531991672364}, "keywords": "Blog ID,Author,category,category,category,category,category,author,CQToday Topic,budget,congressional-relations,executive-orders,john-boehner,pen-and-phone,icnw", "article": {"section": "home", "published_time": "2014-08-26T20:25:28Z", "modified_time": "2014-08-26T20:25:28Z"}, "twitter": {"description": "President Barack Obama may be just about done with this Congress, but there\u2019s one thing he can\u2019t do without \u2014 money.", "title": "Obama Still Needs Congress to Show Him the Money", "url": "http://www.rollcall.com/news/home/immigration-news-obama-needs-congress-emergency-funding", "image": {"src": "http://cdn.videos.rollcall.com/blogs/sites/16/2014/07/immigration009_070714-445x299.jpg"}, "site": "@rollcall", "card": "summary |player (See: https://dev.twitter.com/cards/types/player We will have to submit a test and get approval before using this type)"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9fc7\"", "article_summary": "Related stories: Boehner Moving Toward Late-July Vote on Obama Lawsuit White House: Boehner Lawsuit Uses Taxpayer Money Against Obama for 'Doing His Job' Boehner Planning House Lawsuit Against Obama Executive Actions Boehner\u2019s Memo to Members on Obama Lawsuit 33 House Republicans to Obama: End Deportation Stays for \u2018Dreamers\u2019 Obama Executive Order to Ban LGBT Discrimination Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call in your inbox or on your iPhone.\nBut even Sessions suggested Congress will need to find some money to deal with the crisis.\n(Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call)President Barack Obama may be just about done with this Congress, but there\u2019s one thing he can\u2019t do without \u2014 money.\nHeather Pi\u00f1a Ledezma, a citizen who turned 6 on July 4, attends an immigration rally near the White House.\nBut he will need a historically unproductive Congress to creak into action to do so, even as House Republicans head to the courthouse to sue the president over his executive actions."}
