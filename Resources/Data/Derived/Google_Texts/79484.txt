Congresswoman Mia Love says the toughest thing about Washington is trying to influence unelected bureaucrats -- the best thing is that she has been welcomed and helped by so many of her new colleagues.

Love stopped by the FOX 13 studios for a wide-ranging interview on Live@4.

She explained her Resolution calling for the repeal of a tax on insurance premiums, one of the funding measures that supports the Affordable Care Act.

She also told FOX 13 why her campaign started raising money already, pulling in about $432,000 in the first three months of 2015.

"What I wanted to do was concentrate pretty much on working, and I think that's what the people of the fourth district want me to do, instead of playing catch-up, so I can concentrate most of my time on working and keeping the promises that I made to them," Love said.
