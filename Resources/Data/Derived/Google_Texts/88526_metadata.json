The two most notable were regarding same-sex marriage and Affordable Care Act. But, from a real estate perspective, the court handed down another ruling that could fundamentally change fair housing discrimination law suits.\n\nIn a rancorous 5-4 decision, the high court ruled in favor of disparate impact as a consideration in the application of fair housing laws. So what is disparate impact?\n\nHere's what Wikipedia has to say: \"In United States anti-discrimination law, the theory of disparate impact holds that practices in employment, housing or other areas may be considered discriminatory and illegal if they have a disproportionate adverse impact on persons in a protected class.\n\n\"Although the protected classes vary by statute, most federal civil rights laws protect based on race, color, religion, national origin and gender as protected traits, and some laws include disability status and other traits as well.\"\n\nThe case brought before the Supreme Court (Texas Department of Housing v. The Inclusive Communities Project) was about how the Texas Department of Housing was using federal tax credits for low-income housing.\n\nAccording to the Inclusive Communities Project, an anti-segregation group, the TDH was using disproportionate number of these tax credits in low-income areas and not enough of the tax credits were being used to build low-income housing in middle- and upper-class neighborhoods. And, since this low-income housing would largely be populated by a protected class, the net effect was to discriminate against the right of a protected class to live in middle-class and upscale neighborhoods.\n\nWith respect to housing, this disparate impact ruling basically says that, even when there was no intent to discriminate, if the result can be characterized as discrimination, then there may be legal recourse under the Fair Housing Act.\n\nSome see the ruling as a way to eliminate \"back door\" forms of discrimination. Others see it as a slippery slope that could inadvertently put people in legal jeopardy.\n\nIn a National Review article on the issue, Roger Clegg of the Center for Equal Opportunity says, \"Suppose, for example, that the owner of an apartment complex decides that she does not want to rent units to individuals who have been convicted of drug offenses. She makes that decision without regard to race, her policy on its face does not treat people differently because of race, and indeed she enforces it in an evenhanded way, so that it applies equally to all applicants, without regard to race.\n\n\"Should she be liable for racial discrimination under the Fair Housing Act if it turns out that the policy in her neck of the woods has a disproportionate effect on this or that racial or ethnic group?\"\n\nDennis Parker, director of the ACLU's Racial Justice Program, sees it differently.\n\n\"This ruling recognizes the stark reality that housing discrimination, regardless of intent, persists for many Americans. This decision retains the essential protections of the Fair Housing Act, meaning the law will continue to serve as an important tool in rooting out pernicious forms of racial segregation and discrimination.\"\n\nAs with most things, the truth probably lies somewhere between the concerns of Parker and Clegg. Nevertheless, there's always the law of unintended consequences, and the Supreme Court ruling could actually end up hurting the very people it was meant to help.\n\nThe reason is that expanding the pool of potential liability also expands the number of people who are unwilling to get in the pool. Whereas \"intent\" of discrimination was previously the threshold, disparate impact now extends liability to an \"outcome\" of discrimination, even if such an outcome was unintended or unforeseen.\n\nAs a result, the developers of products like low-income housing might simply decide that the risk isn't worth the reward. The result will be less such housing, not more.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the Supreme Court placed some limitations on the degree to which disparate impact can be applied in an allegation of discrimination. They said claims cannot be based solely on statistical disparities. A plaintiff would need to prove that a policy actually caused the disparity. It's an important distinction that addresses the old adage that figures don't lie, but liars figure.\n\nTo illustrate the point, let's say that statistics show a proportionately low number of minorities live in homes that don't have granite counters. Under disparate impact, someone might try to make the case that by putting in granite counters, a builder is discriminating. According to the Supreme Court ruling, it would be necessary to show that the presence of granite counters caused the disparity. The mere existence of such a statistical fact is not sufficient.\n\nShortly after the Supreme Court decision on disparate impact, the Obama administration also released new regulations through the Department of Housing and Urban Development. These regulations are designed to promote more diversity in the nation's neighborhoods.\n\nAccording to HUD Secretary Julian Castro, these rules would help us \"overcome the legacy of segregation.\" He went on to say, \"where a child grows up should not dictate where they end up. Unfortunately, too many Americans find their dreams limited by where they come from.\"\n\nAs you might expect, the idea of using the power of the federal government to force neighborhood diversity was unpopular with many. It was also a bit unclear as to whether the goal was racial, ethnic or economic diversity.\n\nRegardless, the new regulation has little enforcement power. Zoning powers will remain with local government, where it should be. Even so, the regulation will cost taxpayers millions and, like disparate impact, will likely have the opposite impact of what was intended.\n\nWhether you lean on disparate impact or the new HUD regulations, the simple reality is that we can't all live where we want to. We'd love to have a nice place in Malibu and help \"diversify\" that neighborhood with a couple of people who don't make millions and drive Ferraris, but we wouldn't expect HUD to help get us there.\n\nFurthermore, we'd have to disagree with Castro's odd idea that where someone grows up dictates where they end up. There are plenty of people who come from modest means to lead successful, productive lives. And there are probably just as many who grow up in the lap of luxury, only to end up in the depths of despair.\n\nTrue discrimination \u2014 in housing or any other facet of life for that matter \u2014 is unacceptable. But it would now seem that we're going a bit beyond that. In a world where everyone seems to be offended by something, we might be inventing discrimination as a means to guarantee not only the equality of opportunity, but the equality of outcome as well.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Realities of Real Estate: The impact of disparate impact", "Description": "The Supreme Court recently made some monumental decisions.
