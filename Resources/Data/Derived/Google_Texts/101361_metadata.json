It has swiftly gained attention in both Lithuanian and international media.\n\nThe image is a riff on the famous 1979 photograph that showed Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev and East German President Erich Honecker locked in an embrace.\n\nThat image showed the two men kissing on the lips, once a form of fraternal greeting between socialist leaders.\n\nSpeaking to the the Baltic News Service, Ceckauskas suggested the new painting was inspired by the Soviet-era image. \u201cWe saw similarities between the two heroes (Trump and Putin)\u2026 . They both have an ego that is too big, and it is funny that they get along well,\u201d Ceckauskas said. \u201cWe are in a sort of a Cold War again, and America may get a president who will want to be friends with Russia.\u201d\n\nPutin and Trump are known for exchanging mutual admiration statements, with the Russian leader calling Trump \u201ca very colorful person, tatented without any doubt\u201d and Trump saying it was \u201ca great honor to be so nicely complimented by a man so highly respected within his own country and beyond.\u201d Their relationship may have cooled, however, after Trump\u2019s campaign released a video that appeared to portray Russia as a geopolitical rival.\n\nLithuania and other Baltic states once dominated by Moscow during the Soviet-ere have repeatedly expressed concern about Russian foreign policy under Putin. In a statement sent to us, Keule Ruke said that the artists behind the mural were \u201cpredicting that if Russia and the USA would ever make out, it would happen in the Baltic states \u2026 with tongues or with tanks.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. presidential hopeful Donald Trump are kissing on the side of a barbecue restaurant in Vilnius, Lithuania.", "parsely-tags": "The Feed,The Feed,Trending,News,Nation and World", "parsely-link": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/trending/the-feed/mural-vladimir-putin-kissing-donald-trump-gathering-international-attention", "vf": {"unique_id": "reviewjournal-nid-2190001"}, "author": "ADAM TAYLOR THE WASHINGTON POST", "parsely-title": "Mural of Vladimir Putin kissing Donald Trump gathering international attention", "twitter": {"description": "Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. presidential hopeful Donald Trump are kissing on the side of a barbecue restaurant in Vilnius, Lithuania.", "title": "Mural of Vladimir Putin kissing Donald Trump gathering international attention", "url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/trending/the-feed/mural-vladimir-putin-kissing-donald-trump-gathering-international-attention", "image": {"src": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/NDN-VIDEO-6359390.mov, http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_APTOPIX-Lithuania-Dai_kare_0.jpg, http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_Lithuania-Daily-Life_kare_0.jpg"}, "creator": {"identifier": "@reviewjournal", "id": 15358759}, "card": "summary"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "al": {"web": {"should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"url": "review-journal://?eid=6359390", "app_name": "review-journal", "package": "com.LVRJ"}, "ios": {"url": "review-journal://?eid=6359390", "app_store_id": 540820524, "app_name": "review-journal"}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1098299519", "fb": {"admins": 630759385, "app_id": 195491203833571}, "google-play-app": "app-id=com.LVRJ", "parsely-author": "ADAM TAYLOR THE WASHINGTON POST", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "The Feed,The Feed, Trending, News, Nation and World,", "parsely-section": "The Feed", "article": {"published_time": "2016-05-15T11:50:33-07:00"}, "og": {"site_name": "Las Vegas Review-Journal", "description": "Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. presidential hopeful Donald Trump are kissing on the side of a barbecue restaurant in Vilnius, Lithuania.", "title": "Mural of Vladimir Putin kissing Donald Trump gathering international attention", "url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/trending/the-feed/mural-vladimir-putin-kissing-donald-trump-gathering-international-attention", "image": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/30777670.sfxl_0.jpg%3Fresize%3D750%3A500", "type": "article"}, "parsely-image-url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/30777670.sfxl_0.jpg%3Fresize%3D750%3A500", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9", "parsely-pub-date": "2016-05-15T18:50:33Z"}, "article_summary": "Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. presidential hopeful Donald Trump are kissing on the side of a barbecue restaurant in Vilnius, Lithuania.\nThat image showed the two men kissing on the lips, once a form of fraternal greeting between socialist leaders.\nLithuania and other Baltic states once dominated by Moscow during the Soviet-ere have repeatedly expressed concern about Russian foreign policy under Putin.\nThe mural, painted by local artist Mindaugas Bonanu, was unveiled by the co-owner of the Keule Ruke, Dominykas Ceckauskas, on Thursday.\n\u201cWe saw similarities between the two heroes (Trump and Putin)\u2026 ."}
