A former Del City elementary school teacher was charged with one count of First-Degree Rape of a Child after an alleged incident that took place at school back in May.

The victim, a 10-year-old female student at Epperly Heights Elementary, told police she was walking to the bathroom when she was followed inside by 44-year-old Raymond Crawford, who she says was a fifth grade teacher at the school.

The girl said she went to use the handicap stall but Crawford forced his way inside. The victim said Crawford pulled her pants down and fondled her genitals with his hand. She said he then pulled his pants down and she turned her head away.

During the alleged assault the victim told police she screamed and tried to kick Crawford several times, but it made no difference. After the girl said Crawford pulled out a silver box knife and threatened to kill her if she told anyone what he had done.

Details on when Crawford was arrested and his bond are not known at this time. A court document shows Crawford’s current address to be in Niceville, Florida.

Crawford is no longer listed as a current teacher on the school’s website.
