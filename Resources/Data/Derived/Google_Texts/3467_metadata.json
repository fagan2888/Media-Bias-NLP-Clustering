The most modest of the independent estimates works out to $3,800 per vehicle, even after the fuel savings are taken into account.\n\nSo whose predictions were more accurate?\n\nAlthough we don\u2019t know how prices would have changed if regulations had been left alone, there are several trends that all moved together before the law was changed in 2007.\n\nThe price index for vehicles (adjusted for quality improvements), published by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, had been falling steadily since the 1990s.\n\nThe prices of other large consumer goods\u2014\u201cfurnishings and durable household equipment\u201d\u2014had been falling even longer, as modern manufacturing and trade made things like dishwashers and sofas cheaper.\n\nPrices for vehicles had been falling at about the same rate in the U.K., Australia, and Canada.\n\nSo what happened? Several of these trends showed turbulence during the 2008-2009 global crisis but then resumed their downward paths. The exceptions were car prices in the U.S. and Canada, which enacted similar new, more stringent fuel economy standards.\n\nIn a recently released Heritage Foundation research paper, we\u2019ve compared the recent price trends to the scholarly predictions and found that if U.S. vehicle prices had followed one of the comparable trends, cars would be between $3,975 and $7,140 cheaper today than they are. This massive expense buys very little change in global warming: less than two hundredths of a degree, according to the Obama administration\u2019s own estimate.\n\nCongress should scrap Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards entirely\u2014they cost consumers dearly while having a negligible impact on carbon emissions. Failing that, a new administration can freeze the standards at 2016 levels to prevent the Corporate Average Fuel Economy tax from doubling by 2025, as the Obama administration has planned.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Congress should scrap Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards entirely\u2014they cost consumers dearly while having a negligible impact on carbon emissions.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Congress should scrap Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards entirely\u2014they cost consumers dearly while having a negligible impact on carbon emissions.", "title": "A New Car Will Cost You at Least $3,800 Extra Because of Government Regulation", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160328_CAFE_RK.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-03-29T03:53:57+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1UxoBL8"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Congress should scrap Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards entirely\u2014they cost consumers dearly while having a negligible impact on carbon emissions.", "title": "A New Car Will Cost You at Least $3,800 Extra Because of Government Regulation", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160328_CAFE_RK.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "regulation", "published_time": "2016-03-28T14:36:36+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-29T03:53:57+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Regulation, Costs of Regulation, New Car"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7e71\"", "article_summary": "Congress should scrap Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards entirely\u2014they cost consumers dearly while having a negligible impact on carbon emissions.\nThe exceptions were car prices in the U.S. and Canada, which enacted similar new, more stringent fuel economy standards.\nThe most modest of the independent estimates works out to $3,800 per vehicle, even after the fuel savings are taken into account.\nFailing that, a new administration can freeze the standards at 2016 levels to prevent the Corporate Average Fuel Economy tax from doubling by 2025, as the Obama administration has planned.\nThree teams of independent economists and engineers went up against the EPA\u2019s analysts\u2014finding much larger costs and smaller benefits."}
