Ted Cruz brought a heavily Tea Party-influenced message to Kenai Peninsula voters.\n\nDuring a rally that drew close to 200 people to the Soldotna Sports Center on Sunday, Cruz, R-Texas, sought to draw comparisons between incumbent Sen. Mark Begich, D-Alaska, President Barack Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada.\n\nCruz is one of two high-profile politicians from Outside who are making the rounds in Alaska during the days leading up to the election \u2014 former presidential candidate Mitt Romney will be in Anchorage tonight along with Gov. Sean Parnell and Sen. Lisa Murkowski.\n\nCruz and Sullivan framed Alaska\u2019s race as one of the deciding factors in the Republican Party\u2019s attempt to gain control of the Senate.\n\n\u201cOn Tuesday, the fate of the country is going to be decided here in Alaska,\u201d Sullivan said. \u201cIt is very likely, the control of the United State Senate and whether we continue rubber stamping the Obama administration\u2019s agenda, (the) explosion of debt, no jobs, liberal judges, whether that continues or we start to roll that back and rip it up by the roots.\u201d\n\nCruz said the nation was focused on Alaska.\n\n\u201cA Senate race is, in a real sense, a national battle,\u201d he said. \u201cA good senator, a senator who stands up to fight to defend liberty, defend the Constitution and defend growth, helps all 50 states.\u201d\n\nCruz\u2019s fiery rhetoric struck a chord with many in the audience as he touched on gun control, repealing Obamacare, protecting religious liberty and putting Alaska the forefront of an \u201cenergy renaissance\u201d in the United States. Many in the crawd called themselves Tea Party conservatives, and several wore buttons and T-shirts supporting former GOP senate candidate Joe Miller.\n\nDuring a three-way Republican primary in August, which Sullivan won with about 40 percent of the vote, Miller \u2014 a Tea Party candidate \u2014 finished second with 32 percent.\n\nFor some, having Cruz openly support Sullivan helped to resolve lingering doubts about the candidate.\n\n\u201cWe love Ted Cruz. We like Dan Sullivan. I\u2019d like to learn more about him, but for now he\u2019s got to be our go-to guy,\u201d said Keith Nushart, who attended the rally with his wife Dawn Nushart. \u201cIf Ted Cruz is going to stand by him, we will too at this point.\u201d\n\nThe Nushart\u2019s said they had supported Joe Miller, but had to shift focus to Sullivan after Miller lost the primary.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to keep an eye out,\u201d Dawn Nushart said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see how he votes, watch what he does and keep his feet to the fire.\u201d\n\nWhile the vast majority of the audience crowded around Cruz after the rally, standing in line to take photos with the senator and ask about his plans for the 2016 presidential race, some \u2014 Like Al and Bunny Chong \u2014 made their way straight to Sullivan.\n\n\u201cWe came the very first time that (Sullivan) came here and listened to him and we looked at the different topics and (we) talked about it and we decided to support him,\u201d Bunny Chong said.\n\nAl Chong, who said he does not vote along party lines, said he wanted a person like Sullivan in office.\n\nBunny Chong said Cruz\u2019s speech did not change her mind about Sullivan and that she had been more interested in seeing Sullivan again than she was seeing the Texas conservative.\n\n\u201cI thought it was nice that he would come all the way to provide a voice for Dan Sullivan, so he could say he supports everything (Sullivan) wants to do for Alaska and America.\u201d\n\nReach Rashah McChesney at rashah.mcchesney@peninsulaclarion.com.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Alaska, Peninsula, Clarion, Kenai, Soldotna, Homer, Kasilof, Nikiski, Sterling, Anchor, Point, Seward, Seldovia, Newspaper, News, Weather, Sports, Obituaries, Real Estate, Jobs, Classifieds, Cars, Homes, Fishing, Outdoors, Rashah McChesney", "og": {"site_name": "Peninsula Clarion", "description": "On the second day of stumping for U.S. Senate candidate Dan Sullivan, Texas Sen.
