The Affordable Care Act, they note, may no longer allow trade union workers to use shared benefits plans, which cover a share of their health care costs.\n\nFrustration over losing access to shared plans, the reports say, may also prompt these unions to leave the AFL-CIO.\n\nAs for immigration, McEllrath expressed frustration over the AFL-CIO\u2019s embrace of a congressional comprehensive immigration reform measure that calls for a wait of some 13 years to obtain a so-called green card, and that \u201cfavors workers with higher education and profitability to corporations\u201d at the expense of blue-collar immigrant workers \u201csuch as janitors,\u201d according to his letter.\n\n\u201cWe cannot continue to compromise on the issues that benefit and protect the working men and women of America,\u201d the letter said.\n\nAn article in the Oregonian newspaper said that Tom Chamberlain, the president of the Oregon chapter of the AFL-CIO, characterized the ILWU's withdrawal from their union as unfortunate.\n\nChamberlain added, however, that AFL-CIO head Trumka was skilled at diffusing tension.\n\n\"Hopefully he can use some of that talent with the ILWU to find out what the true issues are and bring them back,\" he said.\n\nFollow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatino\n\nLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino", "article_metadata": {"classification": "MONEY/Career and Jobs, POLITICS/Immigration, MONEY/Economy, LANGUAGES/English, POLITICS/US Congress", "dcterms.modified": "2013-09-03 16:25:53 EDT", "dcterms.abstract": "A union of some 40,000 members said it was leaving the AFL-CIO because it disagrees with its positions on immigration and President Obama\u2019s health care overhaul.", "twitter": {"image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/global.fncstatic.com/static/managed/img/FNL/Politics/0/0/longshoremen%20union.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "site": "@foxnewslatino", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@foxnewslatino"}, "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.publisher": "Fox News Latino", "parsely-metadata": "{\"title\":\"Dock Workers Union Quits The AFL-CIO, Citing Poor Support Of Immigrant Laborers\",\"link\":\"http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/politics/2013/09/03/dock-workers-union-quits-afl-cio-citing-poor-support-immigrant-laborers/\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/global.fncstatic.com/static/managed/img/FNL/Politics/0/0/longshoremen%20union.jpg?ve=1&tl=1\",\"type\":\"article\",\"identifier\":\"bc63728b065e0410VgnVCM100000d7c1a8c0RCRD\",\"section\":\"politics\",\"pub_date\":\"2013-09-03T20:25:53Z\",\"tags\":[\"MONEY/Career and Jobs\",\" POLITICS/Immigration\",\" MONEY/Economy\",\" LANGUAGES/English\",\" POLITICS/US Congress\"]}", "prism.aggregationType": "front", "keywords": "immigration reform,President Richard Trumka,Affordable Care Act,higher education,Richard Trumka,AFL-CIO,President Obama", "prism.channel": "fnl", "dc.description": "A union of some 40,000 members said it was leaving the AFL-CIO because it disagrees with its positions on immigration and President Obama\u2019s health care overhaul.", "dc.identifier": "urn:uuid:bc63728b065e0410VgnVCM100000d7c1a8c0RCRD", "pagetype": "article", "dc.subject": "immigration reform,President Richard Trumka,Affordable Care Act,higher education,Richard Trumka,AFL-CIO,President Obama", "classification-isa": "careerjobs, immigartion, economy, congress", "description": "La NASA en conjunto con Microsoft desarrollaron un software que permitir\u00e1 a los cient\u00edficos trabajar virtualmente en Marte para desarrollar el pr\u00f3ximo Mars 2020Rover.
