We focused primarily on their economic and tax plans to look at what changes might affect the investment world. We\u2019ll go through the candidates in alphabetical order by first name \u2013 Bernie Sanders, Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton and Ted Cruz. Before we dive into our picks and pans for a Cruz presidency, I want to explain a little bit about how we will approach things.\n\nThroughout this series we are going to assume that a candidate\u2019s economic plans, as they are defined now, are enacted as is. Obviously, with a divided Congress, no plan will be enacted exactly as the candidate presents it today. Not only that, if politicians are known for one thing, it\u2019s lying. For all we know, these proposals may not even be close to what the candidates actually plan on doing. Additionally, we are also not the \u201cnumbers police\u201d and are not here to debate whether a candidate\u2019s numbers add up (you want to enact $9 trillion in tax cuts, go ahead, we will analyze that) and we are not \u201cVery Serious People\u201d deciding whether a plan is \u201crealistic\u201d (you want universal healthcare or a giant wall, we will analyze that). We are going with what the candidates say they will do.\n\nEven though nothing the candidates present is enacted as is, the plans usually do at least show the direction that candidates are leaning. For example, Cruz and Trump are proposing huge tax cuts. Is a flat tax really likely to be enacted? No, but it\u2019s likely if elected Cruz would push hard for some type of tax cut. Likewise, is Sanders' $5 trillion infrastructure plan likely to be enacted as is? No, but if elected he\u2019s likely to push very hard for increased infrastructure spending.\n\nAlthough the information about the candidates' plans we have to go on is imperfect and subject to change, we still think it\u2019s useful to look at who the winners and losers might be under their plans.\n\nCruz\u2019s economic platform consists almost solely of his flat tax proposal. Cruz has very little in the way of other concrete proposals or they are simply too small to make a huge difference in the economy (e.g. approving the Keystone XL pipeline). Our primary focus will be on Cruz\u2019s simple flat tax proposal.\n\nUnder his plan individuals would be assessed a flat tax rate of 10% on all income with some deductions. Lower and middle income filers would be eligible for a $10,000 standard deduction and $4,000 personal exemption. Under the plan, a family of four would pay no tax on the first $36,000 of income. The plan also keeps the Child Tax Credit and Earned Income Tax Credit (with a few changes). Businesses will by a 16% tax on net business income, which functions as a type of VAT tax even though it is not referred to as such by Cruz.\n\nCruz\u2019s tax plan would likely shift the burden of taxation from individuals to businesses. When the personal income tax was first introduced, individual income taxes made up approximately 50% of government collected income taxes. Today individual income taxes make up approximately 70% of income taxes collected with corporate income tax making up around 30%.\n\nCruz\u2019s tax plan would cost about $8.6 trillion over a decade (second only to Trump\u2019s), so the economy would be receiving a tremendous amount of stimulus. Unfortunately, the benefits of the tax cut primarily flow to upper income earners who have a lower propensity to spend. The lowest income filers would receive a tax cut of around $46 or 4% of income, the middle group (middle third) about $1,800 or 3.25% of income and the top 1% would see a $400,000 benefit or 26% of income. The top 1% would see gains of $2,000,000 or 29% of income. Thus, the economy would see a limited benefit as most of the income gains accrue to the top. On the plus side, the tax plan does eliminate the payroll tax, which would reduce the cost of hiring workers for businesses.\n\nIn other areas Cruz pledges to repeal Obamacare, increase American exports and pledges to stabilize the dollar (although he does not say how).\n\nIn many respects a Cruz economy would be very similar to a Trump economy as they have similar policies and similar goals. Both propose large tax cuts with benefits that primarily flow to higher income earners, both repeal Obamacare, and both want to strengthen American manufacturing. Therefore, both Trump and Cruz will have some similar buys and sells.\n\nBuy:\n\nLuxury goods companies\n\nWith Cruz\u2019s tax plan even more heavily weighted toward the top, luxury goods companies should be a great buy. Choosing specific winners is a bit harder as many luxury goods manufacturers derive a substantial portion of sales from China, so U.S. centric luxury goods companies are hard to come by. The U.S. is still Tiffany\u2019s (TIF) largest market but it only accounts for 47% of sales. Movado (MOV) gets a majority (54.8% of sales) of its revenue from the U.S., but is more of a mass-market luxury goods company. Another idea is Toll Brothers (TOL) an upscale US homebuilder or perhaps Ferrari (RACE), or almost all American Tesla (TSLA).\n\nCompanies with lots of foreign cash\n\nLike Trump, Cruz is making it easier for companies to move foreign held cash home. His flat tax includes a one-time 10% tax on the repatriation of foreign held cash balances. Shareholders of companies with huge chunks of cash held overseas could benefit nicely from a one-time windfall dividend or stock buyback when the extra cash is brought home (the last one time tax cut resulted in most money being spent this way). Companies like Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) would come out as winners. Cisco (CSCO) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) are other names with large amounts of overseas cash.\n\nSell:\n\nTax preparation companies\n\nThis one is probably the easiest to see coming. If Cruz abolishes the IRS and we can pay taxes using a simple app or via postcard, then there is no need for the thousands of H&R Block (NYSE:HRB) offices across the country. And who would need to use Turbo Tax (Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU)) either?\n\nHealth insurance companies\n\nLike Trump, Cruz promises to repeal Obamacare. As we said in our other article, Obamacare has been a bit of a mixed bag for insurance companies. On one hand it has given health insurers millions of new customers, but on the other hand, some groups of these customers haven\u2019t turned out to be as profitable as the insurers had hoped. Even if the businesses aren\u2019t going as well as executives hoped, losing millions of customers will still be a terrible blow to the companies. When we wrote our previous articles, we listed UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) as one company that could lose out; however, UNH recently reported it was leaving an additional 35 state health care exchanges. So we\u2019ll narrow the list to Aetna (NYSE:AET) and CIGNA (NYSE:CI) as examples of health insurers that could suffer if Obamacare were repealed.\n\nFinancial sector\n\nIn lieu of the IRS, Cruz\u2019s tax plan has financial institutions such as banks and brokerages responsible for collecting tax data and withholding taxes. Needless to say this will impose some enormous costs on the financial sector. Brokerages like E-Trade (NASDAQ:ETFC) and Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW) and banks like Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) or JP Morgan (NYSE:JPM) will see expenses rise. It\u2019s likely that the smallest banks (PowerShares S&P SmallCap Financials Portfolio ETF (NASDAQ:PSCF) ) will be hit the hardest, as they would have fewer resources to fulfill the new requirements.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nWithout a lot of specific proposals, it\u2019s tough to single out winners and losers under Cruz. Cruz\u2019s tax plan really doesn\u2019t change a whole lot other than lowering taxes for the already wealthy, so the effects will be minimal. Other issues such as Cruz\u2019s call for a stable dollar are hard to analyze without information on how he plans on doing that. On the issue of protecting American manufacturers and boosting exports, Cruz\u2019s plan is not fully fleshed out (or is incoherent, I\u2019ll leave that judgment up to you). His VAT tax proposal would not alter import or export costs, so it would have no effect on the current trade balance (both importers and domestic sellers would be paying the new VAT thus the playing field is level). If he alters his proposal to one closer to Trump\u2019s tariff proposal, you can consulate our Trump article for how that may play out.\n\nAbout the author:", "article_metadata": {"apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1054144526", "Description": "Stocks to Buy and Sell If Ted Cruz Is Elected, Stocks: ETFC,SCHW,PSCF,WFC,JPM,AET,CI,UNH,HRB,INTU,ORCL,MS, release date:Apr 27, 2016", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.6, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca55d\"", "article_summary": "Today individual income taxes make up approximately 70% of income taxes collected with corporate income tax making up around 30%.\nWhen the personal income tax was first introduced, individual income taxes made up approximately 50% of government collected income taxes.\nBuy:Luxury goods companiesWith Cruz\u2019s tax plan even more heavily weighted toward the top, luxury goods companies should be a great buy.\nCompanies with lots of foreign cashLike Trump, Cruz is making it easier for companies to move foreign held cash home.\nOn the plus side, the tax plan does eliminate the payroll tax, which would reduce the cost of hiring workers for businesses."}
