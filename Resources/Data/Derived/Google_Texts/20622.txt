A Santa Paula museum will host an event Sunday to celebrate the monarch butterfly.

Organizers said the event will include family-friendly activities, plant and seed giveaways and information booths from noon to 2 p.m. at the Santa Paula Agriculture Museum, 926 Railroad Ave. Representatives from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Museum of Ventura County, UC Cooperative Extension and other agencies will be on hand.

Monarch butterflies travel thousands of miles over many generations from Mexico to the United States and Canada, officials said. But the loss of milkweed habitat and other sites has threatened their survival.

Planting habitat in backyards and school gardens can help, officials said. At the event, they will help people learn how to create butterfly-friendly habitats.

Regular museum admission — $5 for adults, $3 for seniors and students and $1 for children over 5 — will be charged.
