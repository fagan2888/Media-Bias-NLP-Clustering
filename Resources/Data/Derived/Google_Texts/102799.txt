STARTERS

44 Frank Kaminsky (7-0 Sr. C): The Big Ten preseason player of the year has looked fantastic in preseason.

15 Sam Dekker (6-9 Jr. F): Dekker is physically stronger and clearly more confident than last season.

10 Nigel Hayes (6-8 Soph. F): Hayes has dropped more than 10 pounds to 235 and has added a three-point shot.

21 Josh Gasser (6-4 Sr. G): With his surgically repaired left knee stronger, Gasser should be able to finish at the rim more frequently.

12 Traevon Jackson (6-3 Sr. G): Jackson shined in the NCAA Tournament with 12.6 points, 5.2 rebounds and 4.2 assists.

RESERVES

13 Duje Dukan (6-10 Sr. F): Dukan is ineligible for UW's first two games but he will provide scoring, rebounding and energy when he returns.

24 Bronson Koenig (6-4, Soph. G): A natural point guard with incredible court vision, Koenig must be more consistent and assertive.

3 Zak Showalter (6-2 Soph. G): After redshirting last season, Showalter should provide tenacity and energy.

30 Vitto Brown (6-8 Soph. F): Brown should give UW rebounding and defense but he must learn to slow down.

22 Ethan Happ (6-9 Fr. F): Happ probably should redshirt because of the frontcourt logjam, but he will be a player sooner rather than later.

35 Riley Dearring (6-5 Fr. G): Despite redshirting last season, Dearring needs to get stronger, but he can shoot and his length will help eventually on defense.

11 Jordan Hill (6-3 Soph. G): A tenacious defender who has improved his perimeter shot, Hill is contemplating redshirting because UW has enough guards.

2 Jordan Smith (6-3 Jr. G): Smith is a valuable member of the scout team because of his perimeter shooting.

5 Aaron Moesch (6-8 Fr. F): Moesch redshirted last season and will again push the starters in practice.

20 T.J. Schlundt (6-5 Fr. G): Schlundt is a terrific perimeter shooter who could help down the road.

4 Matt Ferris (6-6 Fr. G): A standout high school quarterback, Ferris will contribute on the scout team.
