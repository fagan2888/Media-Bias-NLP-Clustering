It gets stuck, neither partner can separate the bond, and this is not a myth. But for as terrifying as it sounds, does its severity really live up to the hype?\n\nThe idea of a penis getting stuck in a vagina might bring to mind the 2007 film Teeth, a comically absurd horror film about a teen girl whose vagina houses teeth \u2014 described in folk tales as vagina dentata \u2014 which sever every unknowing man\u2019s member, especially when he\u2019s committed a wrong (in her mind). Thankfully, penis captivus isn\u2019t as gruesome, as common, or as serious.\n\n\u201cWhen the penis is within the vagina, it becomes increasingly engorged,\u201d Dr. John Dean, clinical director of gender and sexual medicine for the Devon Partnership NHS Trust in southwest England, recently told BBC Health Check. \u201cThe muscles of the woman\u2019s pelvic floor contract rhythmically at orgasm\u2026 While those muscles contract, the penis becomes stuck and further engorged within [the vagina] until the muscles relax. Blood can flow out of the penis again, the penis starts to go down after orgasm, and the man can withdraw.\u201d He also noted that the rhythmic contractions a woman experiences during an orgasm aren\u2019t spasms \u2014 these usually characterize vaginismus, which can cause vaginal spasms so strong and painful that the vagina closes, according to the National Institutes of Health.\n\nThe fascination with penis captivus, Dean said, is the \u201cprospect of a couple struggling to separate themselves for many minutes.\u201d But he says that in his own experience, on the rare occasions that he\u2019s heard of it, it only happens for a few seconds \u2014 between five and 10. Long enough that \u201cif you\u2019re in that situation that probably seems like an eternity.\u201d\n\nA Limited History of Penis Captivus\n\nAlthough Dean passes penis captivus off as a mild occurrence, there have been reports of more severe cases, however, the condition is already so rare. Only a handful have been reported in the past century, and many were dismissed because they were \u201cbased on hearsay\u201d with a \u201ctenuous connection\u201d to the \u201cactual facts,\u201d Dr. F. Kraupl Taylor, a physician, wrote in a 1979 article in the British Medical Journal (BMJ). But of the cases that he speaks about, he mentions a \u201cmore or less credible instance\u201d from 1910, in which a pair found themselves stuck, and in \u201cintense pain,\u201d from attempts to separate. It wasn\u2019t until the woman was given chloroform, which was once used as an anesthetic, that her vagina was able to release the man\u2019s penis.\n\nAnother physician\u2019s response to Taylor was published in BMJ in 1980. Dr. Brendan Musgrave\u2019s letter spoke about a personal experience that occurred in 1947. At the time, Musgrave was a houseman at the Royal Isle of Wight County Hospital in south England, when a honeymoon couple was brought out of an ambulance \u201con a single stretcher.\u201d The woman was also given anesthetic, and the couple were discharged.\n\nPenis captivus occurs more frequently in animals than it does in humans, Dean said. And it\u2019s not uncommon to see animals that \u201care stuck together after sex, particularly dogs \u2026 and people look on with bemusement.\u201d If there was to be a more notable, severe case in humans that necessitated intervention or admission to a hospital, Taylor wrote, \u201cit would have been eagerly reported in a medical journal with as much evidence and detail as possible.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "penis captivus, sex, stuck, vagina, penis, vaginismus", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Can a penis really get stuck in a vagina during sexual intercourse?
