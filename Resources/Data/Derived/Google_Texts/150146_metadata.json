By getting them completely blotto on vodka, of course. The Animal Accident and Emergency hospital in Melbourne, Australia, explained in a recent blog post that it treats two to three cases of ethylene glycol poisoning per year at its 24-hour emergency centers. Commonly found in anti-freeze solutions, ethylene glycol is also often found in radiator and brake fluids. Bright green in color and tasting very sweet, many a dog will come upon a small stain in the garage and soon find himself unable to resist licking it all up till it\u2019s gone. Yet the chemical easily causes kidney failure in dogs, even when ingested in tiny amounts. Within days, a pet may even die.\n\nWhen Charlie arrived at the emergency center with his owner, Jacinta Rosewarne, staff immediately figured out what had gone wrong with the sick-as-a-dog Maltese terrier. They grabbed a bottle of vodka and took action. First, they inserted a tube through Charlie\u2019s nose and fed it down to his stomach. And then, over the course of about 48 hours, they gave him doses of vodka, the easiest form of alcohol to absorb. Essentially, alcohol alters the chemical reaction transpiring in the digestive tract and prevents kidney failure.\n\nvodka cure You Tube\n\n\u201cIn fact for the whole weekend, Charlie had a huge party with us in the Pet ICU,\u201d the veterinarians wrote in their post. Well, Absolut-ly!\n\n\"He was definitely drunk,\u201d Rosewarne told the Herald Sun News. \u201cHe was stumbling around. I'd go to pat him and he'd push me a way like a normal drunk person. He was vomiting a little, whining like a drunk. It was distressing but funny at the same time. He just slept and slept and slept.\u201d\n\nThroughout the weekend, the emergency center\u2019s staff and Rosewarne monitored Charlie\u2019s progression watching for signs of a complete recovery. Sent home this morning, his owner says the poor fellow's still nursing a hangover. \"I tried to take him for a walk but he just sat down after 50 metres,\" she said. \"I had to pick him up and carry him home.\" Watch his story below, courtesy of YouTube:", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "vodka cure, sick puppy, australian maltese terrier, animal accident and emergency hospital", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A Melbourne animal clinic saved a Maltese terrier's life this weekend by feeding him vodka after he had consumed anti-freeze.", "title": "Vodka Saves Puppy From Anti-Freeze [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/vodka-saves-puppy-sick-anti-freeze-australian-maltese-terrier-had-huge-party-pet-icu-270926", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/10/vodka-3.JPG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A Melbourne animal clinic saved a Maltese terrier's life this weekend by feeding him vodka after he had consumed anti-freeze.", "title": "Vodka Saves Puppy From Anti-Freeze [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/vodka-saves-puppy-sick-anti-freeze-australian-maltese-terrier-had-huge-party-pet-icu-270926", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/10/vodka-3.JPG", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/10/vodka-3.JPG"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Conditions", "published_time": "2014-03-10T17:24:04-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-10T17:24:03-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A Melbourne animal clinic saved a Maltese terrier's life this weekend by feeding him vodka after he had consumed anti-freeze."}, "article_summary": "When Charlie arrived at the emergency center with his owner, Jacinta Rosewarne, staff immediately figured out what had gone wrong with the sick-as-a-dog Maltese terrier.\n\"He was definitely drunk,\u201d Rosewarne told the Herald Sun News.\nvodka cure You Tube\u201cIn fact for the whole weekend, Charlie had a huge party with us in the Pet ICU,\u201d the veterinarians wrote in their post.\nHe just slept and slept and slept.\u201dThroughout the weekend, the emergency center\u2019s staff and Rosewarne monitored Charlie\u2019s progression watching for signs of a complete recovery.\nCommonly found in anti-freeze solutions, ethylene glycol is also often found in radiator and brake fluids."}
