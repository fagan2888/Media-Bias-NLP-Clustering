Cory Gardner, R-Colo (AP Photo/Chris Schneider, File)\n\n(CNSNews.com) - Every new GOP senator who won in last night\u2019s election campaigned on repealing Obamacare.\n\nSenators Cory Gardner (R-Colo.), David Perdue (R-Ga.), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), James Lankford (R-Okla.), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), and Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) all ran on a platform of repealing Obamacare.\n\nGardner touted patient-centered care and a full repeal and replacement of President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act (ACA), otherwise known as Obamacare.\n\n\u201cSmall businesses and the American people cannot afford President Obama\u2019s countless new regulations and tax increases. There is a right way and a wrong to improve our country\u2019s healthcare system, and the President\u2019s healthcare law just isn\u2019t working. We need patient-centered care and lower costs. It is not too late to start over with a full repeal and replacement of the President\u2019s healthcare law,\u201d Gardner said in a statement.\n\nDaines echoed those statements, also calling to repeal and replace Obamacare.\n\n\u201cEvery American wants healthcare at a reasonable cost. No American wants a complicated plan full of false promises, special political favors, and costs we cannot afford. We should repeal Obamacare and implement an affordable health care system that actually improves the quality of health care,\u201d he said.\n\nGeorgia Republican Senate candidate David Perdue (AP Photo/David Gold)\n\nPerdue noted on his campaign page that he was one of the millions who had their personal health care policy cancelled and would support free market solutions to replace Obamacare.\n\n\u201cObamacare is an overreaching federal program that will actually reduce the quality of health care and increase costs. I am one of the millions of Americans that had my personal policy cancelled after being told I could keep it. To make matters worse, Obamacare is discouraging full-time job creation. The consequences of politicians passing a massive bill without reading it continue to emerge. We need to repeal Obamacare and replace it with more affordable free market solutions,\u201d Perdue said on his campaign page.\n\nCotton signed the Club for Growth\u2019s \u201cRepeal-It!\u201d pledge which states, \u201cI hereby pledge to the people of my district/state upon my election to the U.S. House of Representatives/U.S. Senate to sponsor and support legislation to repeal any federal health care takeover passed in 2010, and replace it with real reforms that lower health care costs without growing government.\u201d\n\nErnst and Tillis have said they would repeal Obamacare.\n\nRepublican Iowa State Sen.

Joni supports immediate action to repeal Obamacare and replace it with common sense, free-market alternatives that put patients first, and health care decisions back in the hands of each of us rather than Washington bureaucrats,\u201d Ernst said on her campaign page.\n\n\u201cAs North Carolina\u2019s U.S. Senator, Tillis will push for repeal of Obamacare, a balanced budget, and conservative economic policy,\u201d Tillis\u2019 campaign page stated.\n\nLankford, a former congressman, has previously vowed to repeal Obamacare.\n\n\u201cI vowed to repeal this vastly unpopular law and today I joined more than 240 members of the House of Representatives to honor that commitment,\u201d Lankford said. \u201cAmericans were rightly outraged by its passage and have continued to resist the job-destroying, government takeover of health care. Those voices have not been ignored and the pledge to make government smaller and less intrusive is well underway.\u201d\n\nRounds campaigned on a platform of repealing Obamacare saying, \u201cRepublicans don\u2019t have the votes right now to repeal Obamacare. We must take over control of the Senate which will require Republicans to pick up six seats this cycle. That is why this U.S. Senate race is so important. Please join me in the fight to repeal Obamacare. Our families deserve better.\u201d\n\nFormer South Dakota Gov.

(AP Photo/Nora Hertel)\n\nFormer congresswoman Capito voted for a full repeal of Obamacare, highlighting the massive tax increases that the law would impose on Americans.\n\n\u201cAmericans of all ages and income brackets, and businesses across the country are learning the disturbing truth about the partisan legislation that was rammed through Congress without a single Republican vote. With the law\u2019s full implementation looming, Americans are bracing for massive tax increases and daunting uncertainty. As health care costs soar, families\u2019 access to care is limited and businesses contemplate closing their doors, it is time to fully repeal Obamacare,\u201d Capito said.\n\nSen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska also stated that part of his health care agenda would be to \"lower costs and increase access to healthcare\" with repealing Obamacare as the first bullet point to achieve that goal.\n\nIn Alaska and Louisiana where the Senate races have not been called yet, both GOP candidates have expressed that they would fight for a repeal of Obamacare.\n\nCandidate Dan Sullivan of Alaska has said he would repeal and replace Obamacare as his campaign page reads, \u201cAs Alaska\u2019s Attorney General, Dan sued to stop Obamacare. He will continue that fight as your U.S. Senator. It is time to repeal and replace Obamacare and empower Alaskans to make their own healthcare decisions not the federal government.\n\nLouisiana\u2019s Senate GOP candidate, Bill Cassidy, has also voiced support for the repeal of Obamacare, listing 10 reasons why it should be replaced. As a practicing physician, Cassidy has said that the ACA would drive up costs, endangers access to care, destroys jobs and increases taxes just to name a few.\n\n\u201cBy definition, a law that creates over 150 boards, bureaucracies, and commissions does not empower patients. Repealing this law is the first step to enacting real health care reform that lowers costs and expands access to quality health care for all Americans,\u201d Cassidy said.\n\nThe business and economic reporting of CNSNews.com is funded in part with a gift made in memory of Dr. Keith C.
