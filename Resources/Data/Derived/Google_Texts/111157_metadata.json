John McCain, left, and Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Barack Obama shake hands at the conclusion of the presidential debate at the University of Mississippi in Oxford, Mississippi. Friday, September 26, 2008. (AP Photo/Charles Dharapak).\n\nThe following is an excerpt from Ian Haney L\u00f3pez\u2019s book Dog Whistle Politics: How Coded Racial Appeals Have Reinvented Racism and Wrecked the Middle Class. Haney L\u00f3pez joined Bill Moyers to talk about how politicians use strategic racism to turn Americans against each other and win votes.\n\nWhen Obama briefly referenced race as one of the ways that the GOP might try to scare voters, in addition to the typical \u201crace card\u201d retort, the McCain camp also struck back with the charge that Obama had sought to \u201cpaint John McCain . . . as racist.\u201d This assailment deserves a bit more attention.\n\nThe claim to have been slandered as a racist frequently crops up on the right in response to liberal efforts to focus on troubling racial dynamics and there may be a fair level of cynical strategizing at work in such conservative carping. By translating the claim that race continues to play a distorting role in American life into a narrow indictment of mean-spirited bigotry, conservatives are more able to easily dismiss the allegation as absurd. The invented charge of being a closet Klan member is readily repudiated. In addition, because the charge of being a racist is freighted with social opprobrium, alleging they have been so charged allows conservatives to cast themselves as unfairly maligned victims. The claim to have been called a racist sucks all the air out of the room, ending any substantive conversation; the only thing left is for the race critic to apologize and to deny that she intended to call anyone a racist. In short, for conservatives, alleging that they\u2019ve been called a racist is good strategy.\n\nBut what about the emotional affect that often accompanies this particular defensive kick? Typically, those claiming to have been denoted racists exude outrage or distress. The imagined accusation, their emotions communicate, has wounded them personally, deeply bruising their sense of themselves. McCain\u2019s spokesperson reacted angrily, not only rejecting the non-charge but vigorously defending McCain as someone who \u201cfought his entire life for equal rights for everyone,\u201d as if McCain\u2019s whole career had been smeared.\n\nWatch the 'I Guess I'm a Racist' Anti-Obamacare Ad\n\nOr consider the pained dismay communicated by actors in an ad opposing health care reform. The ad featured perhaps a dozen adults, mostly white and seemingly middle class, including one young woman with a toddler, looking directly into the camera to confess \u201cI guess I\u2019m a racist.\u201d The ad interspersed these aggrieved confessions with text and a voice-over repeating the allegation made by some outspoken liberals, including Jesse Jackson and Jimmy Carter, that race likely informed some of the opposition to Obama\u2019s health care overhaul. These actors were signaling their antagonism to health care reform \u2014 and also to the charge that in politics race matters \u2014 by facetiously taking upon themselves the \u201cracist\u201d label. Yet when they intoned \u201cI guess I\u2019m a racist,\u201d their demeanor communicated not satire but heart sickness.\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to know whether, coming from a politician\u2019s camp or an anti-health care ad, these intonations of wounded feelings were genuine or feigned. Even if the latter, though, they nevertheless track a real sense of distress among many conservatives, including many tea party members, who feel that they have been unfairly vilified as racists. Sometimes allegations of having been called a racist constitute a strategic retort, but often they reflect a deeply felt wound.\n\nSome greet this sort of defensiveness as a sign of progress. At least we\u2019ve arrived at a place where whites worry about being racists, they say. But hair-trigger defensiveness is not a sign of forward movement. On the contrary, it reflects a pattern as old as racism. Racial ideas perpetually adapt to reassure members of the dominant group that, however unjust the social arrangements and whatever the attendant violence, they are good and decent folks. Thus, at virtually every historical juncture, challenges to existing racial structures \u2014 whether it be slavery 150 years ago or the inhumanity of racialized mass incarceration today \u2014 have often been received as personal affronts. Even in eras now recognized as unquestionably racist, most whites accepted the racial status quo as normal and moral and internalized challenges to racial injustice as assaults on their integrity. Thus, that whites should continue to feel defensive today should not be taken to indicate racial progress.\n\nBaldwin\u2019s words go to the larger impact generated when many whites feel implicated as racists. One dynamic is the forced exoneration. But the deeper result is to forestall desperately needed conversations about race in society.\n\nIn 1965, the novelist James Baldwin explored white defensiveness in an essay entitled \u201cWhite Man\u2019s Guilt.\u201d Baldwin started by noting how his color seemed to impede human connection with many whites. They saw his color first and reacting to that, feared an indictment over their own racial position. \u201cAnd to have to deal with such people can be unutterably exhausting,\u201d Baldwin wrote, \u201cfor they, with a really dazzling ingenuity, a tireless agility, are perpetually defending themselves against charges which one, disagreeable mirror though one may be, has not really, for the moment, made.\u201d Baldwin lamented that white defensiveness against possible charges of racism frequently skewed any possible relationship, repeatedly forcing him into exhausting gymnastics meant to reassure whites of their innocence. Just so with contemporary claims of wounded feelings at having been, supposedly, called a \u201cracist.\u201d The actual charge of racial malice is almost never made. And yet, racial justice advocates are time after time pushed to provide exoneration from the fictional accusation of personal bigotry.\n\nBut this is only half the dynamic and indeed, not the important half. Baldwin wrote that he did not need to level any charges, for the proof of white responsibility for racial oppression was everywhere in society. \u201cThe record is there for all to read. It resounds all over the world. It might as well be written in the sky. One wishes that Americans \u2014 white Americans \u2014 would read, for their own sakes, this record and stop defending themselves against it. Only then will they be enabled to change their lives.\u201d The imagined allegation against which many whites aggressively defend themselves today is of personal bigotry. The social indictment written in the sky is rather of a shared responsibility for race\u2019s continued distorting power.\n\nBaldwin\u2019s words go to the larger impact generated when many whites feel implicated as racists. One dynamic is the forced exoneration. But the deeper result is to forestall desperately needed conversations about race in society. Claims to have been personally attacked take productive conversations about current racial patterns and collapse them into a stultifying ventilation of wounded feelings. It shifts attention from racial dynamics that hurt everyone and focuses our eyes instead on the bruised egos of those whites who feel themselves personally targeted whenever the conversation turns to race. The imagined charge is of small-minded bigotry. The actual charge, written across society \u2014 including, importantly, in the racial politics of the GOP \u2014 is that race in various forms continues to harm us all. Histrionic distress about supposedly having been called a racist impedes recognizing the truth about race\u2019s continued harmful power.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2014 by Ian Haney L\u00f3pez.
