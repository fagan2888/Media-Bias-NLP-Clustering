Minnesota schools would also accommodate the transgender student when it comes to locker rooms, especially since the Minnesota Child Protection League (MNCPL), which is fighting against the new policy, brought up the argument that showering among transgenders might wreak havoc among cisgenders. \u201cYou tell me, where is the research that a biological male or a biological female is not a biological male or a biological female,\u201d said MNCPL state coordinator Michelle Lentz, according to the Record. \u201cWhere is the research, where is the science that says that a boy that feels like a girl is every bit a girl.\u201d\n\nAs a result of those against transgender equal opportunity, the policy has had to go through several different drafts to address these issues. And recently, the Minneapolis Star Tribune printed a full-page ad condemning the proposal and thus discriminating against transgender students.\n\nHere we go again - fear mongering ads in @StarTribune about transgender youth. #LetThemPlay @rweingarten @Lily_NEA pic.twitter.com/VnNldnJToS \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Denise Specht (@DeniseSpecht) November 30, 2014\n\nThe draft defines transgender as \u201ca person whose gender identity is different from and does not match the gender assigned at birth;\u201d gender identity as \u201ca person\u2019s deeply-felt internal sense of being male or female;\u201d and gender expression as \u201ca person\u2019s external characteristics and behaviors that are socially defined as either masculine or feminine.\u201d\n\nPerhaps everyone can take note from Brooke Guinan, a transgender who joined the New York City Fire Department amid complete acceptance from her fellow firefighters:", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "transgender, lgbt, minnesota transgender, mshsl", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A new Minnesota policy is under fire for proposing transgender equality in schools and sports teams.", "title": "Transgender Students In This State May Soon Choose Sports Teams Based On Gender Identity", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/minnesota-transgender-students-may-soon-be-allowed-choose-sports-teams-based-gender-313036", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/03/transgender.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A new Minnesota policy is under fire for proposing transgender equality in schools and sports teams.", "title": "Transgender Students In This State May Soon Choose Sports Teams Based On Gender Identity", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/minnesota-transgender-students-may-soon-be-allowed-choose-sports-teams-based-gender-313036", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/03/transgender.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/03/transgender.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Hill", "published_time": "2014-12-03T18:15:42-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-03T18:15:41-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A new Minnesota policy is under fire for proposing transgender equality in schools and sports teams."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf4d9\"", "article_summary": "A Minnesota policy that would allow transgender students to choose sports teams based on their gender identity has entered round four, and is waiting to be approved by the Minnesota High School League\u2019s (MSHSL) Board of Directors.\nAnd recently, the Minneapolis Star Tribune printed a full-page ad condemning the proposal and thus discriminating against transgender students.\nA new Minnesota proposal is aiming to provide equal opportunity to transgender students who are looking to join extracurricular activities and sports.\nIn order to qualify as transgender, the student must provide the school with documentation of their identity and held gender identity, as well as a statement from a health care professional who works with the student to verify the gender identity.\nMinnesota schools would also accommodate the transgender student when it comes to locker rooms, especially since the Minnesota Child Protection League (MNCPL), which is fighting against the new policy, brought up the argument that showering among transgenders might wreak havoc among cisgenders."}
