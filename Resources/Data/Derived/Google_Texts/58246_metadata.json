Clark wore topsiders without socks, belonged to any number of venerable clubs, once worked on Wall Street, had a New York apartment full of paintings by Abstract Expressionist masters that he allowed his Gordon setters to lick and, on top of all that, claimed to have a hand in a black-box precinct of cutting-edge aerospace technology research. Even when Kirn tired of Clark\u2019s selfish ways (he was always \u201cforgetting\u201d to bring his wallet to restaurants), his eccentricities made for good dinner table conversation.\n\nThen one afternoon in 2008, Kirn learned that the police were looking for Clark; he\u2019d abducted his young daughter during a supervised custody visit and had gone underground. But that wasn\u2019t all: People who definitely were Rockefellers claimed that he wasn\u2019t one. Turns out, not only was Clark not an East Coast blue blood, despite his uncanny impersonation of one, he wasn\u2019t even an American. He was born Christian Karl Gerhartsreiter in a podunk town in Bavaria, Germany. And even that wasn\u2019t the end of the story. As Kirn would learn, along with the rest of a marveling nation, one of Clark\u2019s previous identities \u2014 Christopher Chichester, purportedly an English baronet \u2014 was wanted in connection with a murder committed 23 years earlier in the affluent Southern California suburb of San Marino. Clark had been fooling people for decades and people had been lapping it up. \u201cAs a college English major,\u201d Kirn writes, \u201cI\u2019d learn the phrase \u2018suspension of disbelief,\u2019 but with Clark you contributed belief, wiring it from your personal account into the account you held with him.\u201d\n\nBy the time these revelations emerged, Kirn had seen two of his novels (\u201cThumbsucker\u201d and \u201cUp in the Air\u201d) made into acclaimed films and regularly wrote features for high-end magazines like Vanity Fair and the New Yorker. Of course he was going to cover the trial, and he did so for the latter publication. However, by 2013, when Clark was tried for murder, Kirn\u2019s magazine work was \u201cswiftly dissolving in an online acid bath of unpaid content. I needed a book idea.\u201d Anyone who reviews books for a living ends up reading a lot of nonfiction that has obviously been born of similar motives, but the authors always dissemble about that. Typically, the book is presented as merely the byproduct of some urgent personal quest. Yet despite the fact that Kirn has very real, very personal reasons for wanting to understand how and why Clark had gulled him, this is the only time I\u2019ve ever seen an author acknowledge that one of the reasons he wrote the book you\u2019re reading was that he needs to make a living. Notice is served that Kirn\u2019s readers are in for some unvarnished honesty.\n\nThe resulting memoir, \u201cBlood Will Out,\u201d holds to that promise. It\u2019s an absorbing spectacle of self-surgery, in which Kirn mercilessly explores \u201cwhat a perfect mark I\u2019d been. Rationalizing, justifying, imagining. I\u2019d worked as hard at being conned by him as he had at conning me. I wasn\u2019t a victim; I was a collaborator.\u201d Serial impostors like Clark are uncommon, and their mastery at persuading seemingly sensible people to believe just about anything makes them objects of keen fascination. The woman who helped Clark establish his Rockefeller identity (he\u2019d previously been saying he was the brother of filmmaker Cameron Crowe) not only supported him financially and accepted his bizarre story of being pursued by a sinister conspiracy, she also meekly agreed to drive him around (he had no license), to discard their household trash at remote locations and never to look inside the document-filled closet he referred to as his \u201coffice.\u201d He even made her walk on the opposite side of the street when they went out in public, and she complied.\n\nAlthough he ranks this particular victim as their \u201cQueen of Sorrows,\u201d all the witnesses at Clark\u2019s trial form, in Kirn eyes, a \u201clong parade of fools.\u201d He counted himself as a fellow marcher, even though he never took the stand. Yet if there\u2019s anything rarer than a con man with Clark\u2019s gift for the game, it\u2019s a writer of Kirn\u2019s quicksilver accomplishment. The Clark Rockefeller story has been dramatized by the Lifetime Channel (seen from the point of view of his long-suffering second wife, natch) and has previously served as the subject of Mark Seal\u2019s excellent 2011 book \u201cThe Man in the Rockefeller Suit.\u201d But to have someone of Kirn\u2019s ability write about the case from the inside promises exceptional insight into the way such tricksters operate and the even greater enigma of what motivates them.\n\nKirn gives his readers that, although he is not, it must be said, always entirely conscious of doing so. \u201cBlood Will Out\u201d relentlessly scrutinizes the author\u2019s own willingness to ignore the glaring inconsistencies in the stories Clark told Kirn about his life. He overlooked them because going along with Clark mean getting to hang out in the sanctums of the WASP elite. The two men met when Kirn, dazzled by the Rockefeller name and always up for a trip to New York, agreed to drive a crippled shelter dog Clark had offered to adopt from Montana to Manhattan. Their friendship extended over 15 years of occasional meetings and phone conversations, although Clark did once tell Kirn he considered him his best friend: \u201cYou\u2019re the only person in my life who doesn\u2019t want something from me, who isn\u2019t envious.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Walter Kirn's rich pal turned out to be a serial impostor who killed a man.
