(AP) - Columbia City Council members are studying whether to ban indoor use of electronic cigarettes and raise the minimum age to buy tobacco products in the city to 21.\n\nThe City Council voted unanimously Tuesday to send the proposal to a city health and substance abuse board for review. A final version of the proposal would then be presented to the City Council.\n\nThe proposed restriction on electronic cigarettes follows last week\u2019s vote by the Legislature to override Gov. Jay Nixon\u2019s veto of a bill barring sales of the devices to people under 18.\n\nThe city banned smoking in indoor public spaces in 2007 and the minimum age for tobacco purchases is now 18, The Columbia Daily Tribune reported (http://ow.ly/BzWGa ).\n\nFirst Ward Councilwoman Ginny Chadwick said increasing the minimum age for smoking would make it easier to spot underage smokers and make youth smoking less acceptable.\n\n\u201cThis decrease will create lasting benefits on the prevalence of tobacco use and save thousands of lives in Columbia,\u201d Chadwick said.\n\nJonathan Sessions, a member of the Columbia Board of Education, said 18-year-old students in the city\u2019s schools currently can legally buy tobacco products and distribute them to younger students.\n\nAnd Dan Rader, a member of the Substance Abuse Advisory Commission and co-owner of Bengal\u2019s Bar and Grill in downtown Columbia, said staff and patrons at his restaurant have had problems when they confused the electronic cigarettes with cigarettes. He said tobacco restrictions should be the same as those in place for alcohol.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s become quite clear over time that cigarettes are harmful,\u201d Rader said. \u201cBringing that minimum age more in line with the minimum age for alcohol, it makes sense.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Columbia Daily Tribune, http://www.columbiatribune.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Columbia City Council members are studying whether to ban indoor use of electronic cigarettes and raise the minimum age to buy tobacco products in the city to 21.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/sep/17/columbia-talks-raising-age-to-buy-tobacco-to-21/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "Columbia City Council members are studying whether to ban indoor use of electronic cigarettes and raise the minimum age to buy tobacco products in the city to 21.", "title": "Columbia talks raising age to buy tobacco to 21"}, "twitter": {"description": "Columbia City Council members are studying whether to ban indoor use of electronic cigarettes and raise the minimum age to buy tobacco products in the city to 21.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Columbia talks raising age to buy tobacco to 21"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca96b\"", "article_summary": "\u201cBringing that minimum age more in line with the minimum age for alcohol, it makes sense.\u201d___Information from: Columbia Daily Tribune, http://www.columbiatribune.com\n(AP) - Columbia City Council members are studying whether to ban indoor use of electronic cigarettes and raise the minimum age to buy tobacco products in the city to 21.\nThe city banned smoking in indoor public spaces in 2007 and the minimum age for tobacco purchases is now 18, The Columbia Daily Tribune reported (http://ow.ly/BzWGa ).\nThe proposed restriction on electronic cigarettes follows last week\u2019s vote by the Legislature to override Gov.\nFirst Ward Councilwoman Ginny Chadwick said increasing the minimum age for smoking would make it easier to spot underage smokers and make youth smoking less acceptable."}
