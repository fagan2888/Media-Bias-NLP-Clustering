Marriott is launching a program with Maria Shriver to put envelopes in hotel rooms to encourage tipping.\n\nThe campaign, called \u201cThe Envelope Please,\u201d begins this week. Envelopes will be placed in 160,000 rooms in the U.S. and Canada. Some 750 to 1,000 hotels will participate from Marriott brands like Courtyard, Residence Inn, J.W. Marriott, Ritz-Carlton and Renaissance hotels.\n\nThe name of the person who cleans the room will be written on the envelope along with a message: \u201cOur caring room attendants enjoyed making your stay warm and comfortable. Please feel free to leave a gratuity to express your appreciation for their efforts.\u201d\n\nShriver, who founded an organization called A Woman\u2019s Nation that aims to empower women, says many travelers don\u2019t realize tipping hotel room attendants is customary. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge education of the traveler that needs to occur,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you tell them, they ask, \u2018How do I do that?'\u201d She said envelopes make it easy for guests to leave cash for the right person in a secure way.\n\nSo how much should you leave? Marriott International CEO Arne Sorenson says $1 to $5 per night, depending on room rate, with more for a high-priced suite.\n\nMichael Lynn, a professor at Cornell University\u2019s School of Hotel Administration, says his research shows that \u201c30 percent of people stiff the maid,\u201d while 70 percent said they usually leave a tip.\n\nSorenson noted that housekeepers \u201care less frequently tipped\u201d than other hotel workers because they do an \u201cinvisible task.\u201d In contrast, workers who carry bags, hail cabs and park cars tend to get tipped because they \u201cmake a personal connection\u201d with guests, he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Envelopes in Marriott hotels invite tips for maids", "author": "Beth J.
