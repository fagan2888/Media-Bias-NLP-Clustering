These days, many are being cared for by baby boomer children who live far away.\n\nBalancing careers and kids of their own, these grown children may find it difficult to move closer to parents who have begun to need daily help.\n\nCaregiving has become \u201can unexpected second career\u201d for many people in their 50s and 60s, says Tamar Shovali, a gerontologist at Eckerd College in St. Petersburg. \u201cAnd distance caregiving is really difficult.\u201d\n\nIf moving nearer to each other isn\u2019t an option, how can you provide care and support for an aging parent from afar?\n\n\u25a0 Maximize visits. Make the most of periodic visits to your parents\u2019 home, says Amy Goyer, AARP\u2019s family and caregiving expert. Look around to see what sort of shape it is in, and consider modifications (hand rails in a hallway?) that might make it safer and more convenient.\n\nMeet briefly with any doctors your parents see regularly so you can develop a connection. Make sure that a prescription written by one doctor isn\u2019t conflicting with a prescription from another.\n\nAlso, choose a point person who lives nearby and is willing to visit your parents regularly to note any changes in their health, behavior or daily abilities.\n\n\u201cYou can talk to them on the phone, you can even Skype and still not get a full picture,\u201d Goyer says. You need someone onsite to tell you what they\u2019re seeing. This person could be a cousin, neighbor, good friend or someone from their faith community.\n\nIf no one is available, Goyer suggests hiring a \u201cgeriatric care manager,\u201d a growing profession because so many elderly people don\u2019t have relatives nearby. The website caremanager.org is one place to start searching for someone to hire.\n\nEven if your parents live in a facility, rather than at home, see that someone visits them regularly. Small problems can get out of control quickly, says Goyer. Even at good assisted-living facilities, \u201cthere are a lot of services you expect,\u201d she says, and you have to make sure they are being delivered.\n\n\u25a0 Seek out new technology. Baby boomers are increasingly using tools like video chat and e-mail circles (Google Hangouts is one example) to stay connected with parents, says Duane Matcha, professor of sociology at Siena College in Loudonville, N.Y.\n\nBy creating a Google Plus group that includes parents, adult children and even grandchildren, Matcha says, distance caregivers can create a virtual support system.\n\nShovali recommends an app called Reunion Care that keeps all of a person\u2019s medical records in one spot, plus contact information for doctors. \u201cFriends and family can log in and put the information in,\u201d she says, \u201cand that can be done in person or at a distance.\u201d\n\nCameras and motion sensors can help you make sure a parent is moving around the house normally, and monitor visitors as well. Wireless blood pressure cuffs send data to a remote user, and electronic pill boxes can let you know whether elderly parents have taken their medication.\n\nYou can even buy a door lock that can be coded to let in certain people on certain days.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s say on Tuesday and Thursday you have a paid caregiver coming to help your mom take a shower,\u201d Goyer says. \u201cYou can give them a certain code that\u2019s only good on Tuesdays and Thursdays,\u201d and then use a motion-sensor camera to make sure that caregiver arrived on time and left as scheduled.\n\n\u25a0 Have the difficult conversations.\n\nIt\u2019s often heartbreaking to approach your own parents about changes in their mental and physical abilities. It may be even harder to discuss planning for end-of-life medical care or burial wishes.\n\nBut have these conversations early, before critical situations emerge.\n\nAs for discussing whether parents should stop driving, need help managing finances or should consider moving into assisted living, Goyer says it\u2019s valuable to \u201cmake very specific observations.\u201d\n\nFor example, take a ride with them in their car.\n\n\u201cYou can say afterward, \u2018I really noticed you seemed to be having trouble making left turns,\u2019 or \u2018I noticed a lot of dings on the right side of the car,\u2019 \u201d she says.\n\nIn general, Goyer says, approach difficult subjects with an \u201cI\u2019m here to support you. I\u2019m not here to take over your life\u201d\u2019 attitude.\n\nFinally, find a support group for yourself. Just because you aren\u2019t providing daily care \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean that at a distance you don\u2019t need support,\u201d Shovali says. Along with encouragement, you might find good practical advice from people with more experience caring for parents.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2012/09/nursehometeez.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd342d\"", "article_summary": "Just because you aren\u2019t providing daily care \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean that at a distance you don\u2019t need support,\u201d Shovali says.\n\u201cAnd distance caregiving is really difficult.\u201dIf moving nearer to each other isn\u2019t an option, how can you provide care and support for an aging parent from afar?\nMake the most of periodic visits to your parents\u2019 home, says Amy Goyer, AARP\u2019s family and caregiving expert.\nAlso, choose a point person who lives nearby and is willing to visit your parents regularly to note any changes in their health, behavior or daily abilities.\nIf no one is available, Goyer suggests hiring a \u201cgeriatric care manager,\u201d a growing profession because so many elderly people don\u2019t have relatives nearby."}
