MISSION, Texas — A wanted fugitive with apparent connections to a Mexican drug cartel is dead after attacking Texas border sheriff’s deputies who were trying to arrest him. The shooting took place just north of the border city of Mission where authorities tried to arrest the wanted man. It remains unclear, at this time, if the fugitive fired a weapon at authorities or if he used some other weapon to attack them.

Investigators with the Hidalgo County Sheriff’s Office had been trying to arrest the man on various state charges from the sheriff’s office and McAllen Police, said Hidalgo County Sheriff’s Commander Joel Rivera in an interview with Breitbart Texas at the scene just moments after the shooting.

“This was part of Operation Lockdown,” Rivera said. “It was an attempt to apprehend a high profile fugitive. We worked with our partners with DPS, U.S Border Patrol and Constable’s Precinct 3.”

Investigators had developed information that he had been hiding out just north of Mission. When they went to arrest him, the man attacked, forcing the deputies to “use deadly force” which is the police word for shooting the suspect who later died, Rivera said.

A law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation confirmed that the suspect had a long criminal history and some connections with a Mexican drug cartel.

Since Breitbart Texas met with authorities almost as soon as the shooting took place, the suspects name and other details were not readily available, check back for updates.
