With the social care budget being cut, it is more difficult for hospitals to move patients on from the wards to care homes or managed care in their own homes.



There is also a sense that the U.K. population as a whole takes free healthcare as a right, and some may be abusing that right by, for example, showing up at the ER with non-serious conditions, something which has particularly exercised doctors this winter.

"We are going to see a lot of new models of care develop," Cathy Corrie, a senior researcher at U.K. think tank Reform, which has proposed a number of changes to the NHS, told CNBC.

Yet Reform's proposals to charge a small fee for appointments, or an idea from Norman Warner, the former Minister of State for Health, to charge an annual membership fee, coupled with a yearly health review, have not been backed by any major political party. Neither of the leading candidates to be Prime Minister following May's election seems to want their legacy to be the end of "free" healthcare.
