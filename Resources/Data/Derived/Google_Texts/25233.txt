APOLLO, Pa. (AP) – APOLLO, Pa. (AP) – Icy road conditions are being blamed for two pedestrian deaths in western Pennsylvania.

Apollo police say 68-year-old Gary Beigay had just parked his van outside his second-hand store around 7:30 a.m. Saturday when the vehicle started to slide backward on the icy street. Beigay went behind it in an attempt to stop it, but it rolled over him and he died of chest injuries, police said.

In Sewickley, a 49-year-old woman was killed Saturday when she was struck by a car sliding on ice, police told the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review. Kimberly Moran had been walking two dogs at the time, the paper said.

The ice-covered roads caused dozens of crashes throughout western Pennsylvania early Saturday, but conditions were improving as the temperature rose later in the morning.
