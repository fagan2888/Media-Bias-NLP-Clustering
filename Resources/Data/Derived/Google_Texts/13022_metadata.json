They want to repeal Obamacare, dismantle labor unions, repeal any environmental law protecting clean water and air, roll back voting rights, privatize Social Security, stop a minimum wage increase and more. They don\u2019t care about destroying the checks and balances in American democracy to get their way.\n\nIn an updated documentary by Robert Greenwald\u2019s Brave New Films, Koch Brothers Exposed: 2014 Edition, we learn many things the Kochs don\u2019t want you to know, from the origin of their radical agenda to other issues they\u2019ve championed that haven\u2019t made the national news, such as resegregating public schools.\n\nHere are 11 things the Kochs don\u2019t want you to know about them.\n\n1. The family\u2019s $100 billion fortune comes mostly from a massive network of oil and gas pipelines, and investments in other polluting industries like paper and plastics. The brothers inherited the seed money for their holdings from their father Fred Koch, who made his first fortune building oil pipelines for the Russian dictator Joseph Stalin in the 1930s. Back in the states, Fred Koch supported racial segregation and white supremacist groups like the John Birch Society.\n\n2. Koch Industries is the second largest privately held company in America, worth upwards of $80 billion. It is one of the country\u2019s top 15 polluters, responsible for more than 300 oil spills. It has paid over $100 million in fines and been found guilty by a federal jury of stealing oil from Native American lands.\n\n3. The Kochs have invested multi-millions in more than 85 right-wing organizations over the years to push an anti-government, libertarian agenda. Many local Tea Party chapters were fronts for Americans for Prosperity, one of their groups. Another big recipient, ALEC, or the American Legislative Exchange Council, drafts bills and talking points that Republican officials cite again and again. In the 2012 presidential election cycle, the Koch\u2019s right-wing donor network spent $400 million on electioneering.\n\n4. The brothers work to create legal decisions to empower their efforts. They brought two U.S. Supreme Court Justices, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, to give speeches at their invitation-only gatherings for libertarian industrialists. That was before the Court issued itsCitizens Unitedruling, gutting federal laws that restricted the kinds of outside campaigns they bankroll. They funded groups that filed thousands of pages of legal briefs to attack those election laws. After the Court threw out federal campaign restrictions in 2010\u2014a ruling they help to write\u2014the Kochs began to spend unprecedented sums to sway elections.\n\n5. Americans for Prosperity led a successful takeover of the school board in Wake County, North Carolina in 2009, which then ended student busing to resegregate high schools. They resurrected the coded rhetoric of the old South, using terms like \u201cforced busing\u201d and \u201cneighborhood schools.\u201d After hundreds of students were sent to other schools, the uproar was so great the AFP slate was voted out two years later, but not before the kids experienced racism and prejudice.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Robert Greenwald's updated documentary reveals the poster boys for the 1 percent are even worse than you thought", "author": "Steven Rosenfeld", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Robert Greenwald's updated documentary reveals the poster boys for the 1 percent are even worse than you thought", "title": "11 things the Koch brothers don\u2019t want you to know", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/05/21/11_things_the_koch_brothers_dont_want_you_to_know_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2012/03/Koch-brothers-e1447778154333.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Robert Greenwald's updated documentary reveals the poster boys for the 1 percent are even worse than you thought", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2012/03/Koch-brothers-e1447778154333.png", "title": "11 things the Koch brothers don\u2019t want you to know", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "11 things the Koch brothers don\u2019t want you to know", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 1 percent, AlterNet, Citizens United, Koch Brothers, Tea Party", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd86e1\"", "article_summary": "Topics: 1 percent, AlterNet, Citizens United, Koch Brothers, Tea Party, Politics NewsThis article originally appeared on AlterNetThe mega-billionaire brothers, David and Charles Koch, stand apart in the world of Republicans.\nHere are 11 things the Kochs don\u2019t want you to know about them.\nIn an updated documentary by Robert Greenwald\u2019s Brave New Films, Koch Brothers Exposed: 2014 Edition, we learn many things the Kochs don\u2019t want you to know, from the origin of their radical agenda to other issues they\u2019ve championed that haven\u2019t made the national news, such as resegregating public schools.\nBack in the states, Fred Koch supported racial segregation and white supremacist groups like the John Birch Society.\nThey don\u2019t care about destroying the checks and balances in American democracy to get their way."}
