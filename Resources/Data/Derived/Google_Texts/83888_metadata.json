Rubio attacked Obama's domestic policies while trying to soften his party's image as a defender of the rich.\n\nBut much of Rubio's message was swamped by a bottle of water - one that he reached for out of camera range in the middle of his speech - that he needed to lubricate his dry mouth.\n\nThe nationally televised gaffe became the butt of comedians' jokes and political pundits' speculation on whether his chances for the White House had been diminished.\n\nMcMorris Rodgers is expected to attack Obamacare - a theme Republicans have been pounding away on since the law to expand health insurance coverage to millions of Americans was enacted in early 2010.\n\nRepublicans have argued that Obamacare is unworkable, will cost jobs and raise healthcare costs despite Democratic claims to the contrary.\n\n(Additional reporting by Thomas Ferraro; Editing by Jonathan Oatis)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Richard Cowan", "Author": "Richard Cowan", "DCSext.PageNumber": 1, "twitter": {"description": "Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers, the highest-ranking female Republican in the U.S. Congress, will deliver her party's response to President Barack Obama's annual State of the Union address on Tuesday.", "title": "Republican congresswoman to rebut Obama State of Union speech", "image": "http://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20140123&t=2&i=832089617&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=CBREA0M1PMA00", "creator": "@Reuters", "site": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "DCSext.rChannel": "Article -
