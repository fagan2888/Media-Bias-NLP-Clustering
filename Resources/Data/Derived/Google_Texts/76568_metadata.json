Council retreated from its original purpose for the law and passed a temporary measure stating that it will not require any employer in the District to provide insurance coverage for abortion, contraceptives, or any other \u201creproductive health decision.\u201d The temporary measure will expire in 225 days, however, and therefore leaves pro-life employers open to unconstitutional treatment by the government.\n\n\u201cPro-life organizations in our nation\u2019s capital should not be forced to pay for abortions or hire those who oppose their pro-life beliefs,\u201d said ADF Senior Counsel Casey Mattox. \u201cWhile the D.C. Council has retreated from this law\u2019s original goal, which was to force pro-life organizations to pay for abortions in violation of their conscience, RHNDA remains an unnecessary and illegal attack on pro-life conscience that Congress must stop and that we will fight, if necessary, in the courts.\u201d\n\nIn addition to ADF, the signers of the joint statement include representatives from the Southern Baptist Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, Americans United for Life, Americans United for Life Action, March for Life, Concerned Women for America, Susan B. Anthony List, Family Research Council, and the Association of Christian Schools International.\n\nThe Reproductive Health Non-Discrimination Amendment Act of 2014 still prohibits even pro-life and religious organizations from \u201cdiscriminating\u201d against employees and potential employees for any \u201creproductive health\u201d decision, including elective abortions. If the District does not make its temporary amendment to the law permanent, it could also force employers to provide health insurance for elective abortions regardless of the organization\u2019s religious beliefs or pro-life mission.\n\n\u201cThat the House of Representatives took the extraordinary step of formally disapproving this bill demonstrates just how unprecedented and illegal RHNDA is. We will continue to resist, and encourage Congress to address, the District\u2019s egregious violation of the First Amendment and federal law\u2026,\u201d the joint statement says. \u201cWe are nonsectarian pro-life organizations and religious ministries that make the nation\u2019s capital our home. Despite the enactment of this unjust law, we will continue to hire employees who share our commitment to the dignity of every member of the human family. We will not abandon the purpose of our organizations in order to comply with this illegal and unjust law. We will vigorously resist any effort under RHNDA to violate our constitutionally protected fundamental rights.\u201d\n\nThe District\u2019s Human Rights Amendment Act of 2014 is also set to go into effect. HRAA overturns decades-old law and requires faith-based educational institutions to endorse and to provide school resources to individuals and groups who oppose the schools\u2019 religious teachings on human sexuality. ADF attorneys say that both laws violate constitutionally protected freedoms and federal law, including the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, and that ADF will be available to legally represent organizations that are negatively impacted by either law.\n\n\u201cADF stands ready to protect the freedom that schools have not to support student groups whose objectives clearly contradict the schools\u2019 religious values,\u201d said ADF Senior Counsel Gregory S. Baylor. \u201cThe government should not be in the business of forcing people to act contrary to their beliefs when it has no compelling reason for doing so. Federal law and numerous court decisions support that point.\u201d\n\nAs a federal district, D.C. laws are subject to review by Congress before they go into effect. Some members of Congress introduced resolutions to disapprove the bills, but they failed to pass. President Obama threatened to veto the resolutions if Congress passed them.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"url": "http://www.theglobaldispatch.com/adf-pro-life-groups-still-fighting-for-legal-protection-against-obamacare-mandates-11363/", "image": "http://www.theglobaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Jeff-Bridges-RIPD-stop-obamacare-meme.jpg", "type": "website", "title": "ADF, pro-life groups still fighting for legal protection against Obamacare mandates"}, "google-translate-customization": "7236b401605984b1-3bcbee0db8307092-g6f41da462829b1d2-19", "keywords": "Christian News, Religion News, 2016 Election, Outbreak News, Weird News, Movie News, US News, Breaking News, Internet News, Google News", "msvalidate.01": "F9A11A184D618AB8623122584A1DAB2D", "google-site-verification": "iI9n62s9s0Z-wJUY9p3-wGZp6AQYcH-Z1tDba2QiaT0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cPro-life organizations in our nation\u2019s capital should not be forced to pay for abortions or hire those who oppose their pro-life beliefs,\u201d said ADF Senior Counsel Casey Mattox.\n\u201cADF stands ready to protect the freedom that schools have not to support student groups whose objectives clearly contradict the schools\u2019 religious values,\u201d said ADF Senior Counsel Gregory S.
