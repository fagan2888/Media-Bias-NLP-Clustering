RICHARD HAASS, COUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS: With one exception: which is President Obama at the end of the day is responsible for the country and the economy. So he could quote unquote win, but it would be a Pyrrhic victory. So itâ€™s a game of chicken that really neither side wants to go off the edge here.



BRZEZINSKI: That shows how much they hate him and donâ€™t love the country, and thatâ€™s whatâ€™s scary about this.



SCARBOROUGH: No.



BRZEZINSKI: If they actually go through with this.



SCARBOROUGH: They love, are you saying they donâ€™t love the country?



BRZEZINSKI: Uh, are you saying they do?



SCARBOROUGH: Yes, of course Iâ€™m saying they do.



BRZEZINSKI: Ted Cruz and his group loves the country?



SCARBOROUGH: Yes they love the country. I have never once suggested that evenâ€¦



BRZEZINSKI: We disagree.



SCARBOROUGH: â€¦the craziest left-wing lunatic didnâ€™t love their country.



BRZEZINSKI: I think he loves his prospects to develop a database more than he loves the country.



SCARBOROUGH: I think Ted Cruz believes that ObamaCare is dangerous. I think he believes itâ€™s devastating. I think he believes like I believeâ€¦



BRZEZINSKI: Heâ€™s allowed to believe that.



SCARBOROUGH: Right. And I think that he is willing to take extreme measures to stop it from happening.



BRZEZINSKI: But thatâ€™s bad for the country.



SCARBOROUGH: Hold on one second. But you suggested that some people might not love this country.



BRZEZINSKI: I am suggesting that.



SCARBOROUGH: People love this country, but they believe we get to the best outcome in completely different ways.



BRZEZINSKI: You know what? Nobody has ever done this before.
