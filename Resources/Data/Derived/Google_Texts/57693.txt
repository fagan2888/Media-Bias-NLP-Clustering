The Republicans are angry. It's not because they're losing by a laughable degree to Donald Trump or their pipe dream of eradicating Obamacare seeming as dead as Disco. No, the Republicans are angry because they are ready for war. It's been long enough, they say, and it's time to intervene in the Middle East. The threat of ISIS is no longer contained in the area they control and many believe that the United States is in grave danger. "Our nation is under siege," Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey said at a cafe in rural Iowa. "What I believe we're facing is the next world war. This is what we're in right now, already."

According to the New York Times, many prominent Republican representative are imploring Obama to take on a bigger position in the Middle East and flex our foreign policy muscle to correct the many injustices committed on both sides of the Syrian civil war.

The Republicans feel that President Obama is not equipped to deal with the changing nature of the world and cannot handle the impeding fight that America, according to many, will eventually have to join. The candidates further criticized Hillary Clinton for not having the leadership skills to lead America during "wartime."

Marco Rubio, in reference to the Paris Attacks in mid-November, said, "Forty-eight hours after this is over they're still out there talking about gun control measures. As if somehow terrorists care about what our gun laws are. France has some of the strictest gun laws in the world and they have no problem acquiring an arsenal to kill people."

However, despite the strong rhetoric of the Republican candidates, none offered a clear solution for how to deal with the Islamic State. The terrorist group has captured large swaths of land in Iraq and Syria and is beginning to launch international attacks on civilians.
