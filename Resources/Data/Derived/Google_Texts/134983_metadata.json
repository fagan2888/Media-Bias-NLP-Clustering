It\u2019s a trend that\u2019s gone on for years, and the most recent struggles for portfolio managers may be due to their preference for companies that sell coffee, make travel reservations and otherwise focus on nonessentials for consumers. These stocks have had some of the year\u2019s weakest performances.\n\nThrough the end of June, 60 percent of large-cap stock funds fell short of the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index for one-year returns, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. The numbers are starker for funds that focus on small-company stocks: Nearly three quarters of small-cap funds \u2014 73 percent \u2014 failed to keep up with the S&P 600 index, while 58 percent of mid-cap funds underperformed the S&P 400.\n\nIt\u2019s one of the risks of buying a fund where managers are trying to pick winning stocks in hopes of beating an index: They could pick wrong. And when they stumble, they still charge fees that are higher than for index funds.\n\nSo far this year, a mistake has been to focus on companies that sell nonessentials to consumers. They\u2019re collectively known as the consumer-discretionary sector, and they have risen 2.3 percent. That\u2019s well below the 8.1 percent gain for the S&P 500.\n\nStrategists at Goldman Sachs looked at hundreds of large-cap mutual funds with $1.4 trillion in investments, measuring which stocks are most and least favored by managers. They found that most funds devote a bigger slice of their portfolios to the consumer-discretionary sector than the S&P 500 does.\n\nPriceline Group makes up 0.8 percent of the average large-cap fund\u2019s investments, for example. That may not sound like much, but it\u2019s double the online travel company\u2019s weight in the S&P 500. That means Priceline\u2019s performance will have a bigger effect on the average fund than the index, and Priceline has been relatively weak this year, up 1.2 percent. Its stock has struggled since August, hurt by slowing growth.\n\nOr consider Starbucks, another relative favorite of mutual-fund managers. Its stock is down 2.9 percent this year.\n\nTo be sure, mutual-fund managers are prepared to accept short-term drops. But many funds run by stock pickers have struggled to keep up with broad market indexes during the past five years, as well.\n\nIn the five years through June 30, 87 percent of large-cap stock funds have had lower returns than the S&P 500. The percentage of small- and mid-cap funds failing to beat their respective index is nearly identical, 88 percent.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Most mutual funds lag S&P 500 on one year returns", "title": "Most mutual funds lag S&P 500 on one year returns", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/09/12/most-mutual-funds-lag-sp-500-on-one-year-returns/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-12T18:43:59+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-12T18:43:59+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Personal finance"}, "article_summary": "In the five years through June 30, 87 percent of large-cap stock funds have had lower returns than the S&P 500.\nThrough the end of June, 60 percent of large-cap stock funds fell short of the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index for one-year returns, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.\nThey found that most funds devote a bigger slice of their portfolios to the consumer-discretionary sector than the S&P 500 does.\nThat may not sound like much, but it\u2019s double the online travel company\u2019s weight in the S&P 500.\nAnd when they stumble, they still charge fees that are higher than for index funds."}
