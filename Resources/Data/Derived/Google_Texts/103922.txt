The country's first National Coordinator for Health Information Technology, David Brailer, MD, argues in an opinion piece published in the Wall Street Journal April 30 that it's time for Americans to take charge of their medical records.

But getting access to one's growing mound of digital medical data is not as easy as it seems, he points out.

"You can’t force a covered entity to give your data to someone you choose, and you can’t stop them from giving it to someone they choose, " Brailer writes.

He adds, "It is crucial that Congress update health-information policy and privacy rules," and he puts forth four guiding principles for how to go about it.

President George W. Bush appointed Brailer national coordinator in April 2004. He held the post for two years. Brailer later founded health Evolution Partners, a San Francisco-based private equity firm where he is managing partner and CEO.
