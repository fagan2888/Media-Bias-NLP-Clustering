Old man winter may have a persistent grip on the weather outdoors, but the Wauconda Park District created a springlike atmosphere indoors for families at its community center with two back-to-back Pizza With the Bunny events on Friday.

Twenty-four families attended the events, said Tim Staton, superintendent of recreation.

"Dinner was topped off with a small Easter egg hunt indoors," Staton said.

Kristina Yakovler snapped a selfie with the Easter Bunny and her sons, Andrei, 3, left, and Ilya, 18 months, all of Wauconda, during a photo session before the egg hunt.

Those who attended also enjoyed the varied fare that was served.

Joe Stevens, 3, of Wauconda, said between the pizza, carrots, candy, and cookies, the cookies tasted the best.

Girl Scouts from Wauconda Troop 71 volunteered to serve the pizza and snacks to earn points toward a silver star volunteer badge.

The park district's annual Easter egg hunt is Saturday outside next to the community center. at 9:30 a.m., with the Easter Bunny on hand for photos. The egg hunt for children under 3 is at 9:30 a.m., followed by a 9:45 a.m. egg hunt for 4-to-6 year-olds, followed by a 10 a.m. hunt for 7-to-10-year-olds.
