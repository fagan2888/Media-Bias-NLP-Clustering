President Obama’s foreign policy approval/disapproval ratings are upside down for the first time since his 2008 inauguration, according to a new poll from ABC News/Washington Post.

Never before has the percentage of people who disapprove of the president on this issue been higher than it is now. At just 41 percent, his approval rating is now at an all-time low.

Furthermore, twice as many people responded that they “strongly disapprove" as opposed to those who said that they “strongly approve.”

The drop is particularly interesting considering that just last week, President Obama delivered a speech at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point in which he outlined the direction of American foreign policy.

In light of the recent controversy regarding the release of five high level Taliban detainees from Gitmo as well as Russia’s annexation of Crimea, the U.S. role in Afghanistan, and the ongoing war in Syria, these polling numbers are very telling:

When compared with other issues such as the Affordable Care Act, immigration, and the economy, it's fair to say it's been a rough couple of months for President Obama.
