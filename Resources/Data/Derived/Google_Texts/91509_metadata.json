Obama, you see, is more concerned for and correct about everything than everybody else at all times. \u201cNobody shares the frustrations of the American people more than I do,\u201d he told WABC earlier this month; \u201cnobody is more frustrated\u201d than he about the IRS scandal; \u201cno person,\u201d the president affirmed during the election, \u201cis more interested\u201d in \u201cseeing this economy growing strong.\u201d\n\nThe line is contagious. In January, while trying pathetically to sell gun control, \u201cShotgun\u201d Joe Biden informed the press that \u201cnobody\u201d was \u201cmore committed to acting on this moral obligation we have than the president of the United States.\u201d \u201cNobody is more interested,\u201d either, \u201cin finding out exactly what happened\u201d in Benghazi,\u201d \u201cmore upset\u201d about \u201cthe oil spill in the Gulf, or \u201cmore offended about the anti-gay and -lesbian legislation that you\u2019ve been seeing in Russia.\u201d\n\nEven when he\u2019s not interested he\u2019s interested. \u201cThe bottom line,\u201d Obama instructed NASA after cancelling the Constellation program, \u201cis that nobody is more committed to manned spaceflight, to human exploration of space, than I am.\u201d\n\nThe president is not just more concerned than you, but he\u2019s smarter than you are as well. \u201cI think I could probably do every job on the campaign better than the people I\u2019ll hire to do it,\u201d he told his campaign staff back in 2006. Per Jodi Kantor\u2019s book on the president, he delivered the same message to Patrick Gaspard during an interview:\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019m a better speechwriter than my speechwriters,\u201d Obama told him. \u201cI know more about policies on any particular issue than my policy directors. And I\u2019ll tell you right now that I\u2019m gonna think I\u2019m a better political director than my political director.\u201d\n\nIn 2011, Mrs. Obama told a Democratic fundraiser in California that her husband \u201c . . . reads every word, every memo, so he is better prepared than the people briefing him. This man doesn\u2019t take a day off.\u201d\n\nUgly as they are to my eyes, such professions of concern, of omnipotence, and of expertise appear to sell. If you were on the Obama campaign\u2019s mailing list, you will remember a set of creepy e-mails from the First Lady \u2014 e-mails in which she cast her husband as a veritable superhuman who, when he wasn\u2019t being more interested in everything than you, was clearing the snow from the driveway with his bare hands and toiling into the night to the light of candles and the sound of despair. Mitt Romney\u2019s stonewall refusal to advertise his many good deeds may have been politically frustrating in contrast, but it was almost certainly preferable to this crass spousal rodomontade.\n\nAlas, long gone are the noble days in which politicians were expected to pretend that they had neither interest in ascending to a position of power nor confidence that they would be up the task if selected. In the age of \u201cMission Accomplished,\u201d Greek columns, and \u201cwe are the ones we have been waiting for,\u201d the games that the Founders played \u2014 including, it must be said, ostensibly \u201creluctant\u201d George Washington \u2014 look distant and quaint. That self-promotion would trump faux-humility was almost certainly inevitable \u2014 neither reluctance nor reticence are likely springboards to political success in our Look At Me culture \u2014 but it would nevertheless be nice if at least some bashfulness remained.\n\nInstead, we have constructed a cult. Certainly, the American presidency was trending toward Caesaropapism before Barack Obama was elected, but the explosion of technology and the president\u2019s inexhaustible attempt to turn himself into a brand have made things considerably worse. Much of our electorate now lives part-time in a social-media netherworld that makes hero worship not just easy but casual, and the temptation towards recruiting distant figures in locum parentis has proven too much for some. Arguing for more gun control in the wake of the Newtown massacre, the comedian Chris Rock horrified those of us who cling bitterly to notions of limited government by suggesting that Obama was \u201cour boss\u201d and \u201cthe dad of the country.\u201d \u201cWhen your Dad says something,\u201d Rock added. \u201cYou listen.\u201d\n\nAs perverse as Rock\u2019s transmutation of public service into parental guidance is, he\u2019s actually slightly off in his estimation of what the commander-in-chief has become in 2013. That is to say that Obama is less Julius Caesar than he is a tribune of the plebs \u2014 an Oprahfied avatar that has been custom-designed both to indulge and guide the public sentiment like so many Bill Clintons feeling your pain. Politico\u2019s Edward-Isaac Dovere can credibly complain this week that Obama\u2019s behavior means he \u201crisks looking like a bystander to his own presidency,\u201d and the lament that both this president and the wider Left cannot get themselves out of \u201coutsider\u201d mode is without question a fair one. But Dovere misses the point: Obama doesn\u2019t want to be on the inside. He is better off swimming down the middle stream of the culture.\n\nThe peculiar truth is that there are a host of Barack Obamas. Once upon a time, an American president was limited by reality. He could make one speech at a time, lobby Congress one issue at a time, and tour the country locality by locality. Now, there is Barack Obama the human being; Barack Obama the Twitter avatar, whose words are written by a team; Barack Obama the website; Barack Obama the 501(c)3. It\u2019s exhausting. The \u201cBig Brother!\u201d character in George Orwell\u2019s 1984, remember, was not insidious solely because the government he represented was all-powerful and all-seeing, but because he probably didn\u2019t exist. Big Brother was just a construct \u2014 a human face and unitary focal point onto which an entire movement and power structure could project itself.\n\nOn this point, and as regards the wider problem of executive power, conservatives indulge a certain cognitive dissonance, preferring to critique the man and not the trend. I have, by way of example, always failed to understand the obsession that self-described defenders of liberty have with the president\u2019s playing golf. As far as I am concerned, he can\u2019t play enough golf. Bluntly, it is inconsistent to covet limited government, the reduction of state intrusion in private life, and a weaker executive branch and also to gripe that the executive doesn\u2019t spend enough time working. The Texas legislature meets only every other year, which is great. Right? Pick your poison, guys.\n\nWilliam Gibson\u2019s second novel, Idoru, tells the tale of Rei Toei, a Japanese pop singer who becomes a national idol. Rei Toie is not in fact a real person, but instead an artificial intelligence that adapts to her interactions and adjusts herself to become whatever her viewers want her to be. She is, in other words, all things to all people. This president is too fond of slamming his opponents to be able to become an effective Rei Toei, but he nevertheless exhibits some of the traits that one would expect from an adaptive avatar. Every country, we learned in 2012, is Obama\u2019s closest ally; every issue provokes his concern; all the talents are belong to him.\n\nThis model, one suspects, might be diminished slightly with a less celebrated president. But technology and the human tendency toward monarchy are likely to ensure that it will be here in essence for the long term. That is, unless Americans actively resist it. Looking forward, those who prefer their presidents quiet and their republics modest might consider focusing their attentions not on replacing Rei Toei\u2019s software and spinning up a new personality to replace the old one, but instead upon pulling the plug completely, and reminding the head of the executive branch that he is not the roaming repository of the country\u2019s hopes and fears, but instead a servant there to do a particular job \u2014 no more, and no less.\n\n\u2014 Charles C.

Per Jodi Kantor\u2019s book on the president, he delivered the same message to Patrick Gaspard during an interview:\n\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019m a better speechwriter than my speechwriters,\u201d Obama told him. \u201cI know more about policies on any particular issue than my policy directors. And I\u2019ll tell you right now that I\u2019m gonna think I\u2019m a better political director than my political director.\u201d\n\n\nIn 2011, Mrs. Obama told a Democratic fundraiser in California that her husband \u201c\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0reads every word, every memo, so he is better prepared than the people briefing him. This man doesn\u2019t take a day off.\u201d\n\nUgly as they are to my eyes, such professions of concern, of omnipotence, and of expertise appear to sell. If you were on the Obama campaign\u2019s mailing list, you will remember a set of creepy e-mails from the First Lady \u2014 e-mails in which she cast her husband as a veritable superhuman who, when he wasn\u2019t being more interested in everything than you, was clearing the snow from the driveway with his bare hands and toiling into the night to the light of candles and the sound of despair. Mitt Romney\u2019s stonewall refusal to advertise his many good deeds may have been politically frustrating in contrast, but it was almost certainly preferable to this\u00a0crass spousal rodomontade.\n\nAlas, long gone are the noble days in which politicians were expected to pretend that they had neither interest in ascending to a position of power nor confidence that they would be up the task if selected. In the age of \u201cMission Accomplished,\u201d Greek columns, and \u201cwe are the ones we have been waiting for,\u201d the games that the Founders played \u2014 including, it must be said, ostensibly \u201creluctant\u201d George Washington \u2014 look distant and quaint. That self-promotion would trump faux-humility was almost certainly inevitable \u2014 neither reluctance nor reticence are likely springboards to political success in our Look At Me culture \u2014 but it would nevertheless be nice if at least some bashfulness remained.\n\n#page#Instead, we have constructed a cult. Certainly, the American presidency was trending toward Caesaropapism before Barack Obama was elected, but the explosion of technology and the president\u2019s inexhaustible attempt to turn himself into a brand have made things considerably worse. Much of our electorate now lives part-time in a social-media netherworld that makes hero worship not just easy but casual, and the temptation towards recruiting distant figures in locum parentis has proven too much for some. Arguing for more gun control in the wake of the Newtown massacre, the comedian Chris Rock horrified those of us who cling bitterly to notions of limited government by suggesting that Obama was \u201cour boss\u201d and \u201cthe dad of the country.\u201d \u201cWhen your Dad says something,\u201d Rock added. \u201cYou listen.\u201d\n\nAs perverse as Rock\u2019s transmutation of public service into parental guidance is, he\u2019s actually slightly off in his estimation of what the commander-in-chief has become in 2013. That is to say that Obama is less Julius Caesar than he is a tribune of the plebs \u2014 an Oprahfied avatar that has been custom-designed both to indulge and guide the public sentiment like so many Bill Clintons feeling your pain. Politico\u2019s Edward-Isaac Dovere can credibly complain this week that Obama\u2019s behavior means he \u201crisks looking like a bystander to his own presidency,\u201d and the lament that both this president and the wider Left cannot get themselves out of \u201coutsider\u201d mode is without question a fair one. But Dovere misses the point: Obama doesn\u2019t want to be on the inside. He is better off swimming down the middle stream of the culture.\n\n#ad#The peculiar truth is that there are a host of Barack Obamas. Once upon a time, an American president was\u00a0limited by reality. He could make one speech at a time, lobby Congress one issue at a time, and tour the country locality by locality. Now, there is Barack Obama the human being; Barack Obama the Twitter avatar, whose words are written by a team; Barack Obama the website; Barack Obama the 501(c)3. It\u2019s exhausting. The \u201cBig Brother!\u201d character in George Orwell\u2019s 1984, remember, was not insidious solely because the government he represented was all-powerful and all-seeing, but because he probably didn\u2019t exist. Big Brother was just a construct \u2014 a human face and unitary focal point onto which an entire movement and power structure could project itself.\n\nOn this point, and as regards the wider problem of executive power, conservatives indulge a certain cognitive dissonance, preferring to critique the man and not the trend. I have, by way of example, always failed to understand the obsession that self-described defenders of liberty have with the president\u2019s playing golf. As far as I am concerned, he can\u2019t play enough golf. Bluntly, it is inconsistent to covet limited government, the reduction of state intrusion in private life, and a weaker executive branch and also to gripe that the executive doesn\u2019t spend enough time working. The Texas legislature meets only every other year, which is great. Right? Pick your poison, guys.\n\nWilliam Gibson\u2019s second novel, Idoru, tells the tale of Rei Toei, a Japanese pop singer who becomes a national idol. Rei Toie is not in fact a real person, but instead an artificial intelligence that adapts to her interactions and adjusts herself to become whatever her viewers want her to be. She is, in other words, all things to all people. This president is too fond of slamming his opponents to be able to become an effective Rei Toei, but he nevertheless exhibits some of the traits that one would expect from an adaptive avatar. Every country, we learned in 2012, is Obama\u2019s closest ally; every issue provokes his concern; all the talents are belong to him.\n\nThis model, one suspects, might be diminished slightly with a less celebrated president. But technology and the human tendency toward monarchy are likely to ensure that it will be here in essence for the long term. That is, unless Americans actively resist it. Looking forward, those who prefer their presidents quiet and their republics modest might consider focusing their attentions not on replacing Rei Toei\u2019s software and spinning up a new personality to replace the old one, but instead upon pulling the plug completely, and reminding the head of the executive branch that he is not the roaming repository of the country\u2019s hopes and fears, but instead a servant there to do a particular job \u2014 no more, and no less.\n\n\u2014 Charles C.
