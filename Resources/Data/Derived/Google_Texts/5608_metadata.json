Spearchief, a violent high-risk sex offender, was released from prison three days ago, and this victim whose incident occurred a decade ago is now fearing for her safety. Lyle Aspinall/Calgary Sun/QMI Agency\n\nIn order to give a convicted rapist back his life, they take hers away.\n\n\u201cThey re-traumatize me over and over and over again \u2014 it\u2019s been years of hell.\u201d\n\nThe man who attacked her was released from prison on Jan. 17: Keegan Troy Spearchief is a predator with a long record of sexual assault, violence, break-ins and voyeurism, and yet he\u2019s out, living in Lethbridge and likely to re-offend, according to police.\n\nIf every woman in southern Alberta should be nervous about the 28-year-old deviant in their midst, his victim is terrified.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m scared he\u2019ll find me again. I\u2019m freaked out beyond measure. Friday morning they phoned me to tell me they\u2019d let him go \u2014 so he\u2019s free and he can hurt people,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t change these freaking laws, and I can\u2019t seem to get through to anyone \u2014 he had victims before me, and he had victims after me. And they let him out again.\u201d\n\nJust over a decade ago, she was a 40-year-old woman celebrating a break in life, having escaped an abusive partner in Calgary.\n\nShe\u2019d landed a solid job, paying $20-an-hour, and had a new home where she felt safe and ready to start over.\n\n\u201cFor the first time in my life I had a good job, and I was doing so well,\u201d she said.\n\nThat\u2019s when the teenage sexual predator decided to break in, determined to rape someone \u2014 he\u2019d failed his first attempt earlier that evening, after attacking another woman in her home and being chased off by a male resident.\n\nIf there\u2019s a single bright spot in this horrifying story, it\u2019s that 17-year-old Spearchief failed in his second attempt to rape a stranger, and this time, the male homeowner showed up in time to save the terrified victim, and catch the creep trying to force himself upon her.\n\nIt was the justice system\u2019s first opportunity to keep the unrepentant monster behind bars.\n\nOf course, that didn\u2019t happen.\n\n\u201cThe justice system? We don\u2019t have one. They help him, and protect him,\u201d says the woman, now 50, and still trying to put her shattered life back together.\n\nSpearchief was charged, but released on bail \u2014 while out, he committed a third break-in, this time raping a teenage victim at knifepoint.\n\nArrested and charged, Spearchief became the first youth in Canada sentenced as an adult under the Youth Criminal Justice Act, and yet he ended up with a soft four-year sentence.\n\nThe court ruled the young predator\u2019s rehabilitation could be adversely affected by a harsher punishment, so four years was deemed tough enough.\n\nAs the lanky rapist was coddled, his 40-year-old victim saw her life fall apart.\n\nFrightened and in shock, she left her new job and went back to her abusive partner.\n\nThree years later, she moved out again \u2014 just in time to be told Spearchief was free from prison, untreated.\n\nSpearchief refused court-recommended therapy while in jail, leading the National Parole Board to rule he was a risk to re-offend.\n\nYet he was released anyway, because public safety is secondary to a Canadian criminal\u2019s right to a second chance.\n\nSpearchief wanted a second chance alright \u2014 to resume his career as a predator. He was soon back, peeping in windows at naked women.\n\nNever the brightest bulb, he dropped his wallet and cellphone as he fled one scene \u2014 but despite being arrested, he was again granted bail.\n\nEndless chances for dangerous criminals are a hallmark of Canada\u2019s court system, it seems \u2014 but Spearchief blows every break.\n\nLabelled an \u201cuncontrolled sexual deviant\u201d by Calgary police, Spearchief was finally sent back to jail for 3 1/2 years after beating up his common-law wife and mother, before waving a knife at police and demanding that officers shoot him.\n\nThe police held their fire, and now, two years and eleven months later, Spearchief is free again.\n\nFor his victim, it means reliving the old terror \u2014 and waiting for the monster to attack again.\n\n\u201cNow I can\u2019t eat, I can\u2019t sleep \u2014 I just keep pacing and I keep having nightmares,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThey keep letting him out. And I can\u2019t get on with my life.\u201d\n\nmichael.platt@sunmedia.ca", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Calgary Sun", "description": "In order to give a convicted rapist back \r\nhis life, they take hers away.", "title": "Rape victim sees her freedom robbed as repeat Alberta sex offender Keegan Spearchief given his", "url": "http://www.calgarysun.com/2014/01/26/rape-victim-sees-her-freedom-robbed-as-repeat-alberta-sex-offender-keegan-spearchief-given-his?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=recommend-button&utm_campaign=Rape victim sees her freedom robbed as repeat Alberta sex offender Keegan Spearchief given his", "image": "http://storage.calgarysun.com/v1/dynamic_resize/sws_path/suns-prod-images/1297518810965_LARGE_BOX.jpg?quality=80&stmp=1464084233394&size=100x", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 162622253780945}, "description": "In order to give a convicted rapist back \r\nhis life, they take hers away.", "robots": "NOODP,NOYDIR", "pinterest": "nopin"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc97e1\"", "article_summary": "If every woman in southern Alberta should be nervous about the 28-year-old deviant in their midst, his victim is terrified.\nSpearchief, a violent high-risk sex offender, was released from prison three days ago, and this victim whose incident occurred a decade ago is now fearing for her safety.\nA sexual-assault victim of Keegan Spearchief sits in her home on Thursday January 23, 2014.\n\u201cNow I can\u2019t eat, I can\u2019t sleep \u2014 I just keep pacing and I keep having nightmares,\u201d she said.\nSpearchief was charged, but released on bail \u2014 while out, he committed a third break-in, this time raping a teenage victim at knifepoint."}
