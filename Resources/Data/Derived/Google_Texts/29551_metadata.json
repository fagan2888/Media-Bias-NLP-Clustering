From all quarters, scorn is being heaped on him for his banana republic behavior. Visiting Monticello, Obama told French President Francois Hollande that \u201c[a]s President, I can do anything I want.\u201d Obama calls it a joke; as Glenn Reynolds likes to point out, Obama \u201cjoked\u201d about using the IRS to audit his political enemies as far back as 2009. It seems pretty clear that \u201cI can do anything I want\u201d accurately reflects Obama\u2019s views on executive power.\n\nThis image of Obama as a tinpot dictator is making the rounds on Twitter; I saw it in a tweet by thriller author Brad Thor:\n\nMeanwhile, Michelle Obama\u2019s office tweeted this bizarrely tone-deaf photo of the Obamas\u2019 dogs decked out in jewelry for dinner:\n\nWhat were they thinking? I have no idea, but it seems safe to say that the Obamas have lost touch with at least some portion of reality; that is, how Americans view them and the administration\u2019s economic policies. I tweeted the question, \u201cAre they eating cake?\u201d to the @FLOTUS account where the photo was published, but didn\u2019t get a response.\n\nTechnically, President Obama\u2019s misuse of executive agencies to harass his political opponents and his usurpation of Congress\u2019s powers by purporting to rewrite statutes by executive decree\u2013the Obamacare changes are not the only instances\u2013are grounds for impeachment. These are, in fact, precisely the sorts of abuses for which the impeachment remedy was intended, and for which no other remedy is adequate. For political reasons, impeachment is not an option, and I don\u2019t mean to suggest that Republicans should start talking about it. But it is at least worth noting that from a legal standpoint, Obama\u2019s banana republic conduct represents an impeachable offense, or series of offenses.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Power Line", "description": "President Obama\u2019s latest rewriting of the Affordable Care Act may prove to be the last straw.
