He took classes to teach Zumba and become a certified lifestyle coach, a role he now fulfills at a YMCA in Brooklyn.\n\nThe Healthier Communities project, begun in 2004 in collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, seeks to prevent costly chronic diseases through cultural changes that foster healthy lifestyles regardless of ethnicity or economic status.\n\nTwo years ago, the CDC awarded so-called Reach grants, for Racial and Ethnic Approaches to Community Health, to 16 communities already involved in promoting healthier living.\n\nMonica Hobbs Vinluan, director of the initiatives, says the long-term goal is to take disease prevention out of the doctor\u2019s office, where it is based largely on medications, and place it front and center where people live, work, shop and play.\n\nThis project, she said, fosters lasting changes that build healthy communities, for example, by designing sidewalks, providing access to healthy food and creating safe places for children to play.\n\nPromoters of the initiatives recognized that it takes a broad range of perspectives and stakeholders from different sectors of a community to achieve changes that will stick long after the initiators are gone.\n\nParticipating communities have raised an average of $3.47 for every $1 in funding they have received. They have provided residents with more smoke-free zones and work sites; healthier school menus and vending machine options; more and better school-based physical education; thousands of after-school programs that limit screen time and offer more sports programs; hundreds of new sidewalks, biking and walking trails, playgrounds and parks; and thousands of workplaces with better nutrition, more workday activities and active commuting options.\n\nIn Lawrence, Massachusetts, a city of 76,000, the Supporting Active Lifestyles for All, or Salsa, campaign is helping to reverse poor eating and exercise habits.\n\nNearly three-fourths of Lawrence residents are Hispanic; 28.6 percent live below poverty level; 90 percent don\u2019t meet national guidelines for fruit and vegetable consumption; and the numbers reporting any leisure time physical activity fall way below the state\u2019s average, the Y program reported.\n\nThe Merrimack Valley YMCA and the YWCA of Greater Lawrence joined forces with the mayor\u2019s office and health task force, the city\u2019s board of health, a hospital and family health center and business leaders to counter sedentary lives and poor nutrition that raise the community\u2019s rates of diabetes and heart disease.\n\nSince adopting a Healthy Active Living Resolution in 2013, the city has seen a drop in childhood obesity, increased sales at farmers markets, more fresh produce at five bodegas, new employee wellness programs and more opportunities for physical activity.\n\nJulian Villegas of the Merrimack Valley Y said that in two years, the program had reached more than 25,000 people.\n\nMore than 2,000 children go to the Y each week for physical activity and an \u201cactive science\u201d program where they learn about nutrition and how the body works.\n\nThey are given pedometers and tablets to translate activity into calories burned, then taught how to replace those calories with good food, Villegas said.\n\nThrough the Lawrence bodega project, fruits and vegetables have been repositioned so they are what customers see first, and \u201cRethink Your Plate\u201d posters in shops encourage choosing foods that are more nourishing and lower in calories.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2015/06/1003069099-FL_SAR_hfbrody23.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc5d7\"", "article_summary": "The Healthier Communities project, begun in 2004 in collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, seeks to prevent costly chronic diseases through cultural changes that foster healthy lifestyles regardless of ethnicity or economic status.\nJulian Villegas of the Merrimack Valley Y said that in two years, the program had reached more than 25,000 people.\n\u201cBecause of the Y, I\u2019ve been able to completely transform my life,\u201d Caraballo said in an interview.\nAt 38, Caraballo was seriously overweight and on the way to developing diabetes when, through the recommendation of two doctors, he joined the Y\u2019s Diabetes Prevention Program.\nMore than 2,000 children go to the Y each week for physical activity and an \u201cactive science\u201d program where they learn about nutrition and how the body works."}
