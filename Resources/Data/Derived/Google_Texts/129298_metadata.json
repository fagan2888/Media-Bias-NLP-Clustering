Nico van Aelstyn, representing the plaintiffs, told Bay Area public radio station KQED, \u201cDoctors are not providing aid-in-dying because they\u2019re afraid to; they\u2019re afraid of being prosecuted.\u201d\n\nOne of the plaintiffs, Angie Bloomquist, died in early August from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, (ALS), and wanted to take the fatal medication given by her doctor, Robert Brody, months ago.\n\nVan Aelstyn said, \u201cThis is truly an instance where justice delayed was justice denied. While we acted as fast as we could, it was not fast enough to provide relief for Angie. Should the next patient of Dr. Brody\u2019s suffer the way Angie did?\u201d\n\nBut the state attorney general\u2019s office bluntly state that the three doctors should not be allowed to ignore or change state law by themselves, that the issue should be decided by legislators or voters.\n\nIn July, San Diego Superior Court Judge Gregory Pollack ruled against three plaintiffs requesting the right to take lethal medication.
