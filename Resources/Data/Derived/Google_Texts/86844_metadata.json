But the health care world\u2019s response has been tepid, in part because there\u2019s so little transparency about health care costs and who pays when fatal mistakes occur.\n\nThe drive toward more transparent costs is critical to helping people make often complicated choices about their health coverage, from choosing a high-deductible insurance plan to figuring out which plan delivers the best value at the lowest cost, the panel agreed.\n\nBut panelists stressed that patients, who are often sick when they\u2019re faced with important health care decisions, aren\u2019t in the best position to be assertive with their doctors.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Full health care policy coverage)\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re sitting in a hospital with a johnny on and your butt hanging out, you are not in the position to be a powerful chooser,\u201d Binder said.\n\nPanelists also agreed that a tectonic shift in the way health care is delivered and paid for \u2014 with an emphasis on bringing costs down \u2014 is underway, fueled in part by the Affordable Care Act. But it will only pay off if transparency follows suit.\n\nYet that, too, is changing rapidly, argued Jeanne Pinder, CEO of ClearHealthCosts, and it\u2019s driven by consumer fury \u2014 particularly among women.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s actually a revolution going on in this country that defies the sort of easy abstractions,\u201d Pinder said. \u201cConsumers are in flames about this issue, and it turns out to be, perhaps not surprisingly, about women\u2019s behavior in the marketplace.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "They say overtreatment and preventable medical errors are huge drivers of health care costs.", "title": "Experts: Health care waste an issue", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/07/politico-pro-health-waste-in-healthcare-108476.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/07/01/probreakfast_js_1_3281.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Obamacare,Health Care,Affordable Care Act,Doctors", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "They say overtreatment and preventable medical errors are huge drivers of health care costs.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "| John Shinkle/POLITICO Experts: Health care waste an issueDespite health care industry concerns about wasteful and unnecessary care, it\u2019s nearly impossible for patients to overrule their doctors when they think they\u2019re getting a procedure they don\u2019t need, a prominent patient care advocate argued Tuesday.\nBut the health care world\u2019s response has been tepid, in part because there\u2019s so little transparency about health care costs and who pays when fatal mistakes occur.\n\u201cI\u2019ve had four unnecessary EKGs,\u201d Daniel Wolfson, executive vice president of the ABIM Foundation, said at a POLITICO Pro Health Care breakfast briefing at the Newseum.\nPanelists also agreed that a tectonic shift in the way health care is delivered and paid for \u2014 with an emphasis on bringing costs down \u2014 is underway, fueled in part by the Affordable Care Act.\nBut panelists stressed that patients, who are often sick when they\u2019re faced with important health care decisions, aren\u2019t in the best position to be assertive with their doctors."}
