Insurers Drop PPO Plans Under Obamacare

Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Texas and other health insurance providers are dropping PPO plans across the state. This year there were 15 preferred provider organization plans available in Harris County under Obamacare, next year there will be none.

“This is a direct result of the Affordable Care Act and the mandates that carriers have to operate within a certain medical loss ratio,” says Corbin Cooke at Core Benefits.

PPO plans no longer make good business sense.

“There's just not enough margin for them to allow individuals the choice of having a large PPO network as a option in their individual coverage,” says Cooke.

“Blue Cross lost $400 million in the health exchange individual business last year,” he says. “The ACA was supposed to provide some assistance with those losses, that reimbursement is approximately 12 percent.”

Point of Service plans offered by Aetna and Humana also are gone next year, leaving only HMOs, or health maintenance organization, for those seeking coverage under Obamacare.
