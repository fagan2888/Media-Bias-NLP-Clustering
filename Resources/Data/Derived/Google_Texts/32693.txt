On the cam­paign trail back in 2010, Demo­crats from battle­ground dis­tricts and states twis­ted them­selves in­to rhet­or­ic­al knots to try to dis­tance them­selves from Obama­care, an un­pop­u­lar law that Re­pub­lic­ans would use as a raft to ride in­to the ma­jor­ity in Novem­ber. “It’s ba­sic­ally been ra­dio — and tele­vi­sion — si­lence. Even as Re­pub­lic­ans have at­tacked Demo­crats on the bill, Demo­crats haven’t seen fit to fight back — pre­fer­ring to change the sub­ject,” The Wash­ing­ton Post‘s Chris Cil­lizza wrote at the time.

Rep. Jim Costa, D-Cal­if., who barely hung onto his seat that year, voted for the Af­ford­able Care Act, but later said he would have pre­ferred a more “in­cre­ment­al” ap­proach to health care re­form. Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., made a full flip-flop, go­ing from “I’d be for it” to “I would not have sup­por­ted that.” Mean­while, Blue Dogs like former Rep. Heath Shuler, D-N.C., touted their vote against the law and hoped it would in­su­late them from party back­lash.

Spoil­er alert: It didn’t work. Demo­crats lost 63 seats and the Blue Dogs were nearly wiped out.

Now, some Re­pub­lic­ans are fa­cing the in­verse prob­lem. While the more ideo­lo­gic­al wing of the party forced a con­front­a­tion over Obama­care that led to the first gov­ern­ment shut­down in 17 years, GOP can­did­ates in more com­pet­it­ive dis­tricts want noth­ing to do with it, even as they feel pres­sured from the right to avoid dis­own­ing the Ted Cruz wing all to­geth­er. So they’re opt­ing for a duck-and-cov­er ap­proach in­stead.

It’s hap­pen­ing in south­ern Ari­zona, where Re­pub­lic­an can­did­ate Martha Mc­Sally “wouldn’t take a stand [on the shut­down] des­pite mul­tiple re­quests for her po­s­i­tion from The Re­pub­lic, Ari­zona Daily Star, Green Val­ley News/Sahuar­ita Sun and KVOI-AM (1030),” as the Ari­zona Re­pub­lic re­por­ted this month. “She would say only that the shut­down is ‘a fail­ure of lead­er­ship,’ ” the pa­per’s Re­bekah Sanders ad­ded.

In New Hamp­shire’s 1st Dis­trict, Re­pub­lic­an Dan In­nis, who is primary­ing two-term Rep. Frank Guinta, wouldn’t say if he would have sup­por­ted the GOP’s ef­fort to de­fund Obama­care by link­ing it to a gov­ern­ment shut­down fight. “Obama­care is a dis­astrous, big-gov­ern­ment takeover of the health care sys­tem. While I sup­port re­peal­ing Obama­care, I think we’ve got to be real­ist­ic,” he told the AP.

In up­state New York, Re­pub­lic­an con­gres­sion­al can­did­ate Elise Stefanik used her first policy state­ment of the cam­paign to cri­ti­cize in­cum­bent Demo­crat­ic Rep. Bill Owens for vot­ing against the series of Re­pub­lic­an bills to fund cer­tain parts of the gov­ern­ment while leav­ing the rest closed. “But she re­peatedly would not say wheth­er she would have voted for the same four bills, if she was in Con­gress,” the Glens Falls Post-Star re­por­ted.

And across the coun­try in Cali­for­nia, Re­pub­lic­an chal­lenger Bri­an Nest­ande be­moaned the fisc­al fight in Wash­ing­ton, but “de­clined to say if he would have joined Re­pub­lic­ans who lob­bied House Speak­er John Boehner to take a hard line on Obama­care,” ac­cord­ing to the River­side Press En­ter­prise.

Mean­while, in the biggest race of the year, Vir­gin­ia gubernat­ori­al can­did­ate Ken Cuc­cinelli has been feel­ing the heat. He said he’s “very dis­ap­poin­ted” with “both parties in Con­gress,” adding that a shut­down is “an un­ac­cept­able out­come for Vir­gin­ia.”

There’s no doubt the shut­down has been harm­ful to the GOP brand, with the party’s dis­ap­prov­al rat­ings shoot­ing up 9 points since the shut­down, ac­cord­ing to a re­cent ABC News/Wash­ing­ton Post poll, and it seems the party’s can­did­ates are wor­ried that the dam­age will ex­tend bey­ond Re­pub­lic­ans already in Con­gress. It’s still way too early to say how much the shut­down will im­pact the 2014 elec­tion, but it seems it’s already creep­ing in.
