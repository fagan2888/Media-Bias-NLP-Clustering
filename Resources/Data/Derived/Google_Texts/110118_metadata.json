But the concentration of businesses and residents also makes roads more crowded. That\u2019s why dense, transit-friendly cities like New York have longer commute times than sprawling, transit-deficient cities like Phoenix. Think of it this way: New York has fewer cars per capita, but even fewer roads per capita. And building mass transit, contrary to popular belief, doesn\u2019t generally reduce traffic congestion. (Neither, by the way, does the expansion of roads.) Growth produces traffic, and urban growth produces even more.\n\nWith that in mind, consider the unusual case of Arlington County, Virginia. Just across the Potomac River from Washington, D.C., home to the Pentagon and National Airport, Arlington has grown rapidly over the past half-century. Like many inner-ring suburbs, its population exploded between 1940 and 1960, from 57,000 to 163,000. But then, after a period of decline in the 1970s, it grew again, from 153,000 in 1980 to 227,000 today.\n\nThat second spurt of growth did not look much like the first: The new Arlington reached for the sky, with clusters of high-rise buildings that today give the county a more impressive skyline than the squat panorama of the capital. What\u2019s more, population numbers don\u2019t tell half the story. Office space in America\u2019s fourth-smallest county has expanded from about 6 million square feet in 1960 to about 40 million today \u2014 making it a greater employment center than downtown Dallas or downtown Denver.\n\nAnd here\u2019s the really remarkable thing: Despite the influx of tens of thousands of workers and residents, despite the transformation of this sleepy suburb into a mid-size city, traffic has thinned. Nearly 20,000 cars traveled along Wilson Boulevard, a major east-west route here, each day in 1980. Today, that number is down to 13,000. Other arterials have shown similar declines: On the six-lane Jefferson Davis Highway (yes, Virginia has one of those), traffic dropped by 15 percent between 1996 and 2011/12. During that same period, the Lee Highway and Washington Boulevard also recorded 15 percent reductions in traffic.\n\nIn essence, Arlington has shown that the mistakes of American suburban development can be corrected within a few decades. The county won the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s 2002 award for Smart Growth Achievement, and its planning history is so locally celebrated that the county commissioned an hour-long documentary about its transformation from bedroom suburb to thriving city.\n\n\u201cArlington is the most important suburban place in the country,\u201d Christopher Leinberger, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, told me this week. \u201cIf you don\u2019t understand Arlington, you don\u2019t understand the future of the country.\u201d\n\nThe story begins in the 1960s, when Arlington\u2019s old-style suburban way of life was threatened by more distant suburbs offering bigger stores, bigger roads and bigger yards. But a series of decisions taken in the 1970s allowed Arlington to reinvent itself. First, the county litigated to prevent Interstate 66 from carving up Rosslyn, forcing the highway into a more circuitous riverine route. Second, as the newly built Washington Metro pushed into Virginia, planners pushed for a series of underground stations in the midst of the urban fabric, instead of acceding to the much cheaper method of running the tracks in the highway median.\n\nAround the new Metro stops, the county devised a series of \u201cbull\u2019s-eye\u201d plans for high-density, mixed-use developments. Between 1970 and 2000, the Rosslyn-Ballston corridor \u2014 just two square miles \u2014 added 15 million square feet of office space and 15,000 residential units. Adding in the Metro corridor in nearby Crystal City, Arlington\u2019s seven \u201cstation sectors\u201d produce half of the county\u2019s real estate revenue from just 7 percent of its area. It may be the only American suburban district where fewer than half of residents drive to work.", "article_metadata": {"description": "How one city avoided the worst of suburbanization and revealed the path toward sustainable urban development", "author": "Henry Grabar", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "How one city avoided the worst of suburbanization and revealed the path toward sustainable urban development", "title": "The suburb of the future is here", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/07/06/the_suburb_of_the_future_is_here/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/arlington_virginia.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "How one city avoided the worst of suburbanization and revealed the path toward sustainable urban development", "creator": "@HenryGrabar", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/arlington_virginia.jpg", "title": "The suburb of the future is here", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "The suburb of the future is here", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Arlington, Dream City, suburbs, Urban design, urban development, urban planning, Virginia", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb796\"", "article_summary": "With that in mind, consider the unusual case of Arlington County, Virginia.\nGrowth produces traffic, and urban growth produces even more.\nTopics: Arlington, Dream City, suburbs, Urban design, urban development, urban planning, Virginia, Innovation News, Sustainability News, NewsWe often associate high-density cities with car-free life, and rightly so.\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t understand Arlington, you don\u2019t understand the future of the country.\u201dThe story begins in the 1960s, when Arlington\u2019s old-style suburban way of life was threatened by more distant suburbs offering bigger stores, bigger roads and bigger yards.\nAnd here\u2019s the really remarkable thing: Despite the influx of tens of thousands of workers and residents, despite the transformation of this sleepy suburb into a mid-size city, traffic has thinned."}
