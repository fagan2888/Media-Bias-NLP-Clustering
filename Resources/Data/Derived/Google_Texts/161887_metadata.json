In 2013, the last year for which data is available, 15.5 percent of America\u2019s seniors \u2014 roughly 9.6 million people \u2014 faced the threat of hunger. Personal illness, family financial trouble \u2014 especially following the recession \u2014 or losing a spouse add to the problem. When mortgage payments and medicine are a priority, there is not always money left for food.\n\nTonight on the PBS NewsHour, watch a full report on seniors and hunger. We reported from Naples, where we met several people who were willing to share their stories with us.\n\nHarry and Sarah Knight, 76 and 75, moved to Naples 14 years ago after selling their house in New Jersey. Harry found a job at Publix grocery store, which helped make ends meet. But things started to crumble when Sarah\u2019s numerous health problems \u2014 Crohn\u2019s disease complicated with a string of other ailments, like giant cell arteritis, polymyalgia and fibromyalgia \u2014 began to drain them of their funds. Then, Harry got fired after a verbal clash with his manager.\n\nNow, the Knights budget about $100 for food each month. They receive about $17 worth of food stamps per month and the rest they receive from Jewish Family and Community Services of Southwest Florida, a local organization that provides food, services and activities for seniors in the region.\n\n\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for the [JFCS], we\u2019d be starving,\u201d Sarah said. JFCS provides them three gift cards with $25 on each every month, which they can use to purchase necessities other than food.\n\nEven with the help, they\u2019re still $700 short on their monthly budget, a large part of which is for medicine for both Harry and Sarah need, especially after Harry was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer\u2019s last year. Research has found that food insecure seniors are more vulnerable to disability and are more likely to suffer from chronic diseases like diabetes, heart disease and hypertension, which require a healthy diet.\n\n\u201cThis is my biggest gripe. I said, \u2018All my life, I\u2019ve struggled,\u2019\u201d Sarah said. \u201c\u2019So now, in my 70s, I have to struggle all over again?\u2019 It bothered me a lot. In fact, I felt suicidal \u2014 that\u2019s why I\u2019m going to a therapist.\u201d\n\nJaclynn Faffer, president and CEO of JFCS of Southwest Florida, did not foresee this problem, either, when she first opened the senior center.\n\n\u201cWe were surprised to find the significant needs that exist in Collier County, in terms of financial security and food insecurity,\u201d Faffer said, adding that out of their 676 members, about 60 percent are at, near or below the poverty line.\n\nThe JFCS senior center also provides grocery deliveries for those who cannot drive or are without a car \u2014 another common problem faced by food insecure seniors nationwide. Research has shown that typically, if you cannot drive, it makes it harder to secure affordable food. Among low-income families without a car, 64 percent are food insecure, about twice the rate of low-income families that do have access to transportation.\n\nAngelo and Mina Maffucci, 82 and 79, are among those who struggle without the use of a car. Not too long after they moved to Naples, they lost most of their savings in the mortgage nosedive and on medical bills for Angelo\u2019s back injury and prostate cancer.\n\nThey were able to live in an apartment their son owns, free of rent, but without a car or money, they sometimes went for an entire day with just a cup of coffee.\n\n\u201cWe hated to ask, you know? We didn\u2019t know where to go, because we didn\u2019t \u2026 ever have a problem like this before,\u201d Mina said.\n\nCurrently, they live on Social Security checks, food stamps, grocery delivery from the JFCS senior center and additional help from their son.\n\nDorothy Abruzzo\u2019s apartment is impeccably clean and adorned with carefully curated vintage furniture that she has collected over the past few decades, with empty walls completely free of any photos except for one: her parent\u2019s wedding portrait from the early 1900s.\n\nTwenty-four years ago, after her husband died, Dorothy followed her daughter to Naples from Philadelphia. She paid cash for a condo in a luxurious area \u2014 Pelican Bay \u2014 then had to keep lending money to her daughter who was going through some financial and marital trouble. Dorothy worked a daytime job at a luxury dress shop until she had to go through an emergency carotid artery surgery that left her sick and unable to drive for a while. She was able to recover, but a recent mismanagement of funds by a relative left Dorothy with pretty much nothing, forcing her to rent and live on food stamps.\n\n\u201cI mean, I never in my life thought I would have needed charity. \u2026 83 and I\u2019m renting and on food stamps,\u201d Dorothy said. \u201cI\u2019ve put myself on a budget [for food] \u2014 $159 for the whole month.\u201d\n\nAt 94 years old, Beatrice \u2014 a pseudonym, because she wished to stay anonymous \u2014 still drives a beat-up, red Pontiac everywhere, even with her lungs semi-permanently in need of oxygen support. She\u2019s always been independent \u2014 and still wants to be \u2014 but when it comes to food nowadays, that became almost impossible, especially after moving out of her son\u2019s condo after he suffered a stroke.\n\n\u201cYou know that [SNAP benefits and supplemental food programs] makes me feel very insecure to even talk about it, because, I [wasn\u2019t] that type at one time. And to get this at 94, and to have these people help, it\u2019s unbelievable.\u201d she said.\n\nOn top of her medical bills, Beatrice has to pay the monthly rent of $885 for her efficiency apartment, and she\u2019s worried that the rent will go up in the fall. She receives $70 in food stamps each month and additional help from the JFCS senior center, including grocery gift cards and the food pantry.\n\n\u201cI do everything alone. I go shopping alone, still drive a car. I\u2019m very independent. That\u2019s the thing that bothers me. At one time, I was in control. But the recession has done terrible things,\u201d Beatrice said.\n\nOver the next decade, the number of baby boomers struggling with food insecurity is expected to rise by 50 percent.\n\nGovernment food programs won\u2019t be enough to serve this population. That is where programs like those offered by Jewish Family and Community Services\u2019 senior center fill in the gaps. But many of these groups nationwide face long waiting lists and worry, too, about the coming need.\n\n\u201cSeniors are living longer, and they\u2019re outliving their incomes,\u201d said JFCS\u2019s Faffer. \u201cAnd, unlike younger people, who we can help find a job, find more affordable housing, with our seniors, that just can\u2019t happen.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The warm sands and tony neighborhoods in Naples, Florida, give it the name \u201cParadise Coast.\u201d But for seniors struggling to keep food on the table, it\u2019s far from a paradise.", "pubdate": 20150522, "og": {"site_name": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "The warm sands and tony neighborhoods in Naples, Florida, give it the name \u201cParadise Coast.\u201d But for seniors struggling to keep food on the table, it\u2019s far from a paradise.", "title": "Asking for help at 80 -- America\u2019s new faces of hunger", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/DSC_8379.jpg", "url": "http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/senior-hunger-photo-essay/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "The warm sands and tony neighborhoods in Naples, Florida, give it the name \u201cParadise Coast.\u201d But for seniors struggling to keep food on the table, it\u2019s far from a paradise.", "title": "Asking for help at 80 -- America\u2019s new faces of hunger", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/DSC_8379.jpg", "creator": "@newshour", "site": "@newshour", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"app_id": 114150878604116}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newshour", "tag": "senior hunger"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Editors' Picks, florida, food insecurity, great recession, long-term care, naples, photo essay, poverty, retirement, senior hunger"}, "article_summary": "Currently, they live on Social Security checks, food stamps, grocery delivery from the JFCS senior center and additional help from their son.\nShe receives $70 in food stamps each month and additional help from the JFCS senior center, including grocery gift cards and the food pantry.\n\u2026 83 and I\u2019m renting and on food stamps,\u201d Dorothy said.\nIn 2013, the last year for which data is available, 15.5 percent of America\u2019s seniors \u2014 roughly 9.6 million people \u2014 faced the threat of hunger.\n\u201cAnd, unlike younger people, who we can help find a job, find more affordable housing, with our seniors, that just can\u2019t happen.\u201d"}
