Jesse Lee Peterson has learned after 25 years of battling in the trenches of the culture wars, it\u2019s that the enemy never rests, never gives up, never falls down on the job.\n\nIf they lose a battle, they regroup and come back more prepared and confident the next time.\n\nConservative Christians, Peterson says, don\u2019t seem nearly as unified or committed. And that\u2019s why they don\u2019t win many battles.\n\nMost people know Peterson as the founder of Los Angeles-based Brotherhood Organization of a New Destiny, or BOND. He hosts a radio show, pastors a church and oversees a private school. He\u2019s also one of WND\u2019s most fearless columnists, calling out Houston\u2019s lesbian mayor \u201ctyrant\u201d and Ferguson\u2019s \u201cthug\u201d rioters, among others.\n\nEven major water damage from a burst pipe, which required rebuilding part of the Christian school on the BOND campus, couldn\u2019t keep him down last week. Peterson traveled to Jackson, Mississippi, to lead a protest against that state\u2019s last remaining abortion clinic. At age 65, his energy is boundless, says his assistant, Ermias Alemayehu.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been doing it for 25 years now, and his radio show is kind of like life case studies that show people can overcome whatever their issues are,\u201d Alemayehu said. \u201cHe believes everything comes back to responsibility and the way parents raise their kids.\u201d\n\nPeterson\u2019s overarching mission is to strengthen the family, especially America\u2019s black families, by \u201crebuilding the man,\u201d which he says will lead to stronger fathers.\n\nDonate to the BOND ministry, which has been set back by unexpected expenses related to a recent flood.\n\nBut before he became a conservative dynamo, Peterson was a union organizer. That\u2019s right: He worked for the \u201cother side,\u201d and he learned a thing or two about the tactics used by the left-leaning community organizers and change agents who are now embedded throughout the federal government.\n\nHis work with a local labor union representing hospital service employees taught him the importance of agitating and staying on the offensive, he said. The union taught him to avoid playing defense at all cost.\n\n\u201cOne thing they taught us in training was how to always be the aggressors and be on the offense. Because the person on the defense, the only thing they\u2019re trying to do is protect themselves,\u201d Peterson said.\n\nLooking for an angry person\n\nHow did Peterson start to recruit for the union hall? It was simple, he said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019d tell me to go to a hospital and find an angry person, then organize that hospital after a while by working through the angry people,\u201d he said. \u201cAngry people can be controlled unlike non-angry people who can\u2019t be controlled.\u201d\n\nThis is how the radical left pushes its agenda today, he said. They use the Saul Alinsky \u201cRules for Radicals\u201d playbook to divide the races and divide the genders. At the first sign of division, they immediately rush in to exploit the anger for their own political advantage.\n\nPeterson, 65, grew up on a farm in rural Alabama and later moved the Gary, Indiana, and by 1970 he was already involved in liberal politics. He said public protests were organized down to the smallest detail, with everyone knowing their job.\n\n\u201cWe would have a group of people doing the chanting, and a group of people doing the sit-in,\u201d he recalled.\n\nPart of the group at the sit-in would be instructed to lie down for the police and allow themselves to be taken off to jail, with the promise that they would be quickly bailed out by the union. Another group participating in the sit-in would be told to get up and not be taken to jail, thereby splitting the police force in half between those taking people to jail and those having to stay and monitor the sit-in.\n\n\u201cWe kept them on the defense, and they would be so stressed out that eventually they would come out and give us what we wanted,\u201d he said.\n\nHe tells that story only to show that Christian activists aren\u2019t as committed.\n\n\u201cChristians living in fear have lost the authority of God and don\u2019t have the courage to be on the offense and that\u2019s why they are losing on every hand,\u201d Peterson said. \u201cI tell Christians our battle is spiritual, and evil cannot handle you if it cannot put you on the defensive.\u201d\n\nHouston mayor\u2019s overreach \u2018just a test drive\u2019\n\nA good example of the audacity and relentless pushing of the envelope by liberal activists is the situation in Houston, first reported by WND, in which the city\u2019s lesbian mayor subpoenaed the sermons of local pastors who opposed her ordinance banning \u201cdiscrimination\u201d against LGBT people. The ordinance was sweeping to the point of requiring unisex bathrooms in public places.\n\nSince the story broke on WND and was picked up by other news outlets, the backlash has been tremendous against Mayor Annise Parker.\n\n\u201cThe fact that she did it she needs to be impeached but she\u2019s kind of backing down for right now because I\u2019m sure she didn\u2019t expect the amount of reaction she\u2019s got from the pastors,\u201d Peterson said.\n\nLetters have come into City Hall from pastors and others across the country, some sending Bibles with their letter and reminding the mayor that this is America, where the First Amendment guarantees freedom of speech and religion.\n\n\u201cBut these people are getting into positions of power, and they hate Christians and the Christian church because they say homosexuality is wrong. They want to shut down anyone who speaks out about it, so once they get in power you will see more of this type of thing,\u201d Peterson said. \u201cThis was just a test drive. They see now that there will be a strong reaction, but they will just go back and regroup and be better prepared for it next time around.\u201d\n\nAnd therein lies the lesson about persistence.\n\n\u201cOne of the things I\u2019ve learned about children of the lie is they do not give up,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are determined to push the lie and incorporate the lie into America, and they do not give up, they just go back and regroup and if it takes years they will keep at it. And that\u2019s how the Christians are supposed to be. We have God with us, the Holy Spirit is with us and some angels are with us, and yet Christians are afraid to use that authority they have to fight against evil.\u201d\n\nNo \u2018playing nice\u2019 with evil\n\nIf Christians had anywhere near the stamina to fight for good as the other side fights for evil, they would not be witnessing the historic transformation of American society that is taking place today, he says.\n\n\u201cNot only will Christians not fight against the liars, but they\u2019ll fight against you for not backing down to the liars,\u201d Peterson said. \u201cIf Christians were strong, there\u2019s just no way evil would be winning. Because evil doesn\u2019t give up. You have to destroy evil. You can\u2019t play with evil. You can\u2019t be nice to evil.\u201d\n\nHe also points to the dramatic events taking place in the Middle East, where the Islamic State, or ISIS, is taking over Iraq in the face of weakness by President Obama.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re about to take over Baghdad because Obama\u2019s being nice,\u201d Peterson said. \u201cHe\u2019s like, \u2018I\u2019m going to be nice to you if you will be nice to us,\u2019 and they\u2019re cutting off Americans\u2019 heads.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s what the liars in this country are doing, they just keep pushing because they know the Christians are meek and humble and not going to fight back.\u201d\n\nWhile the Bible does teach humility, Peterson believes there is a false sense of humility gripping the American church.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not real. When you read the life of Jesus and his disciples, they were not weak people. They knew they were fighting a spiritual evil, and they didn\u2019t back down from it,\u201d Peterson said. \u201cBut Christians today, Christians in America, don\u2019t seem to see that. They read it and talk it, but they won\u2019t live up to it.\u201d\n\nHe said the excuse he most often hears is that people can\u2019t stop what\u2019s pre-ordained by God.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll say the end times are coming anyway. There\u2019s nothing you can do about it,\u201d Peterson said. \u201cIt\u2019s only coming because they won\u2019t fight back. It comes because the Christians allow it to come and won\u2019t shine the light into darkness.\u201d\n\nHealing the racial divide\n\nPeterson was one of the first black pastors to come out and say that Michael Brown, who was shot and killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, in August, was not an innocent bystander shot in cold blood while raising his hands to surrender.\n\nNo, Peterson said, Brown was a thug trying to brutalize a cop.\n\nEven as the facts began to trickle in more than a week after the shooting, indicating that indeed the officer had reason to fire his weapon at Brown, few black leaders reversed their positions and came to the officer\u2019s defense.\n\nPeterson said that\u2019s because many blacks in America still harbor intense anger against whites, because that\u2019s what they\u2019ve been taught by black leaders for decades. Only a few like himself have listened to alternative black voices like Walter Williams, Thomas Sowell and Shelby Steele.\n\nPeterson said BOND\u2019s mission is to rebuild the family by rebuilding the man and to \u201cunite the races with truth instead of dividing them with lies.\u201d\n\nBut there\u2019s a lot of work to do in that regard.\n\nThe division among the races in America six years into the administration of Barack Obama is more pronounced than ever, Peterson said.\n\n\u201cI grew up on a plantation in Alabama and the races were closer then than they are today,\u201d Peterson said.\n\nMany blacks and whites believed race relations would improve after Obama was first elected.\n\n\u201cEspecially whites. I tried to tell them that it wouldn\u2019t. On my speaking tours, I said, you are not going to be able to change black people\u2019s minds and their racist mindset by giving them a black president,\u201d Peterson said. \u201cBlack people have to admit and deal with that anger toward white Americans, or things are never going to get better.\u201d\n\nPeterson said he estimates about 80 percent of American blacks harbor deeply rooted racial anger toward whites.\n\n\u201cIn some cases, it\u2019s unconscious. They don\u2019t realize they are racist, until a white person disagrees with them about a political issue or President Obama,\u201d Peterson said. \u201cEven black Christians. And many black-white friendships have been broken up \u2013 the friendship ends \u2013 because that\u2019s when you see the racist attitudes come out of the black person. That\u2019s when the anger comes out. And they won\u2019t admit it\u2019s them. They are angry, and they can\u2019t see the truth.\u201d\n\nPeterson said he has had white people come to him in tears about the loss of a long-term relationship with a black friend.\n\n\u201cSome had gone to church together, hung out together for years, and when Obama was elected it all fell apart and ended,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate. America has not dealt with the black racism and has not dealt with the anger, and the anger did not start with adults. It started as children in the home, when their parents or black leaders and many of the black preachers told them that it was white racism.\u201d\n\nSince racism started in the home, that\u2019s where it will have to be defeated, Peterson said. That\u2019s why he concentrates his ministry on the family.\n\n\u201cIt started in the home first with the weakness of the parents, and then it\u2019s encouraged by some of the black churches and some of the liberal white people, too, are using it to really keep blacks down and use the civil rights issue for their own personal gain as well,\u201d he said. \u201cLiberal white and black politicians are responsible for this.\u201d\n\nHe said the Congressional Black Caucus, NAACP, Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson all work to \u201ckeep black people angry by trying to convince them that everything that is wrong is a race issue. They go into a hypnotic trance and just believe it.\u201d\n\nThe only way they are going to come out of that trance is to get to know themselves and where that anger came from so they can forgive their parents for failing them, Peterson said.\n\n\u201cThen God will forgive them and then they can see the truth, and the hatred for white people and everything else will fall away and they can judge people based on character, not color, because they can now see the spiritual aspect of what\u2019s going on,\u201d he said.\n\nWas it the same misplaced anger that was seen spilling out into the streets in Ferguson? Peterson thinks so.\n\n\u201cYes, 100 percent, we saw the anger. We saw it in the George Zimmerman-Trayvon Martin situation. We saw it in Ferguson where an officer killed a black thug that was attacking him. We saw it in the O.J. Simpson killing,\u201d Peter said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about what\u2019s right; it\u2019s about the color.\u201d\n\nFear brings out the worst\n\nSo what is Peterson\u2019s advice to whites who genuinely want to improve relations with blacks, both personally and in the broader American culture?\n\nHe said the worst thing whites can do is to cower in fear and just give up on blacks.\n\n\u201cI would tell white people to overcome fear of being called racist and tell them the truth even at the risk of losing their friendship,\u201d he said. \u201cOtherwise, it will only get worse, because when you cower down to them it makes you look guilty. If you tell the truth, it will force them to look at themselves. But as long as white folks are afraid of being called racist or being sued, it makes things worse. Fear brings out the worst in people, and that\u2019s what they\u2019ve done over the years. They\u2019ve catered and catered to black people and it\u2019s only brought out the worst, the knock-out games, the black mob violence, all that is because they know that white people are afraid of them and it\u2019s just bringing out the worst.\u201d\n\nIslam: A rising threat to black Christians?\n\nAnother one of Peterson\u2019s concerns is the rise of Islam in America and its appeal especially to blacks.\n\n\u201cI am very concerned about it, and I\u2019ve been concerned for a long time,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do a lot of work in the jails and prisons around the country, and usually whenever I\u2019ve gone, I\u2019ve seen Louis Farrakhan\u2019s people there recruiting and telling them that Islam is the black man\u2019s religion and Christianity is the white man\u2019s religion. Then they\u2019re told there are the blood-sucking Jews taking advantage of the black, and they\u2019re just building on the anger that\u2019s already there and fueling hatred of Jews and Christians and America.\u201d\n\nPeterson points to the three Minnesota cases in which young black men left the United States to go fight for ISIS in Syria. One of them was American born and had converted to Islam from Christianity.\n\nThe Oklahoma man who beheaded a woman in that state last month, Alton Alexander Nolan, was also black and a recent convert to Islam.\n\n\u201cI interviewed an L.A. police officer on my show who worked in counter terrorism and was a man of color and a Muslim, and he told me that most of the Muslims in this country are black,\u201d Peterson said. \u201cI\u2019m very concerned about that because they\u2019re going to use those people to carry out whatever terrorist act they are planning.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn all honesty, because they\u2019re black I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to get dealt with in an appropriate way. We\u2019re already seeing it\u2019s been called workplace violence. So they\u2019re not pointing out the evil of Islam, and it\u2019s just going to encourage others to do worse things.\u201d\n\nPeterson said he predicts that if Islamic terrorism is not dealt with, Americans will live to regret it.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to see suicide bombings in shopping centers and buses like in Israel, because it\u2019s not being stopped and the president is not calling it evil or Islamic, so it\u2019s not going to get better,\u201d Peterson said. \u201cHe sees it as just a few thugs in crime. That\u2019s not the case. And because of that, I don\u2019t see anything that could stop it. So short of a miracle from God, we need to buckle down and get ready because we\u2019re going to have a difficult time ahead of us, with suicide bombers in restaurants and buses and crowded places.\u201d\n\nPeterson said the men he once revered, men like Jesse Jackson, now find themselves in a difficult situation. They are so far into the lie that even if they realize it is backfiring, it\u2019s hard to find their way out.\n\n\u201cBlacks have been set up for this. I don\u2019t believe that Jackson and most of the black preachers preaching all this hatred all these years knew it would get to this point, but they have been set up,\u201d Peterson said. \u201cThe feminists at NOW have used blacks for hatred of men. The NAACP has used blacks for hatred of whites. The Democratic Party has used blacks and set them up because they are angry and can\u2019t help but allow themselves to be used. So they\u2019ve been set up now for Islam to come in and be the next to use them.\u201d\n\nAbortion: The final solution?\n\nAs if blacks are not preyed upon enough by liberal politicians and Islamic recruiters, there is another weapon the left uses to destroy the black family \u2013 abortion.\n\nPeterson has been among the most steadfast supporters of the pro-life movement. He will put other projects aside and travel out of state if he thinks he can help shut down an abortion clinic, which is what he did last week when he joined in the pro-life rally in front of an abortion clinic in Mississippi.\n\nThere is one abortion mill left in Mississippi and it\u2019s in Jackson. So on Tuesday we did a little protest in front of the mill. There was a group of feminists there, real hard-core leftists, calling us names and getting in our faces, and there was one black woman with them who came up to me and said what are you doing here?\u201d Peterson said.\n\nHe calmly told the woman, \u201cIt would be good for you if you don\u2019t get in my face.\u201d\n\nThen he asked her, \u201cWhat happened to your soul that you, as a black woman, would work with these folks to kill black children?\u201d\n\nHe said the woman \u201cwent nuts\u201d and tried to accuse him of touching her, when it was she who got in his face and bumped into him. The whole encounter was on video, so the woman got nowhere with her false accusation, Peterson said.\n\nHe said the abortion clinic was right in the heart of the black community in Jackson.\n\n\u201cWhile we were there, we just saw car after car pull in and they\u2019re marching in there. Some were brought by their mothers, and we tried to explain what\u2019s going on. But they are just so angry, they think Planned Parenthood cares about them. \u2018It\u2019s just a medical center,\u2019 they said.\n\n\u201cWe went there to educate them and give talks on what they should do. But with their anger at white folks, they just have it all backward.\u201d\n\nHe said many black politicians and even some black preachers are getting money from Planned Parenthood for various church programs teaching about \u201cwomen\u2019s health\u201d issues.\n\n\u201cSo the left, the liars, they have it down pat. Our side, it\u2019s difficult,\u201d Peterson said. \u201cWe cannot get them to organize. We cannot get them to work together with full force against evil. If you make one mistake, they\u2019ll turn on you and work with the other side. The Christians have got to know: The answer is, we\u2019ve got to rebuild families and get men to turn back to God. If we don\u2019t rebuild families and work together, America is over, because it\u2019s not about race. It\u2019s not about the physical.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about the spiritual and the children of God. If they\u2019re truly born again of God, they would know that it\u2019s spiritual, and they would use the authority given them by God to fight evil.\u201d\n\nAndrew Klavan, an award-winning novelist, screenwriter and media commentator, said Peterson is a one-of-a-kind personality in America today.\n\n\u201cJesse derives his insight and wisdom from a very specific soul journey he was sent on. You listen to him speak or read his books and he is talking right out of his own life,\u201d Klavan said. \u201cYou can disagree with him on this point or the other, sure, but you can\u2019t shrug him off. He\u2019s too real.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "If there\u2019s one thing the Rev.
