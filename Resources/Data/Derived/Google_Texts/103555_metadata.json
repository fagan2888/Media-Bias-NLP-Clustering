Wei Sun, a professor of mechanical engineering at Drexel University, led a team who mixed gelatin, fibrous proteins, and cervical cancer cells into a potion they fed the machine they\u2019d earlier created: a 3D cell printer.\n\nBlowing the old dot-matrix printers completely out of the water, the machine prints the specified models in layers atop a grid structure 10 millimeters long and wide, and two millimeters tall. On the grid, which closely resembles the fibrous proteins composing the extracellular matrix of a tumor, the cells grow \u2014 assuming a spherical shape after five days.\n\nCancer models used to study possible drug treatments are now in 3D, scientists report.

Yet those 2D cell cultures may finally be replaced in many experiments with printed models, the researchers say.\n\n\"With further understanding of these 3D models, we can use them to study the development, invasion, metastasis and treatment of cancer using specific cancer cells from patients,\" Wei told Live Science. \"We can also use these models to test the efficacy and safety of new cancer treatment therapies and new cancer drugs.\u201d\n\nHowever, the researchers hadn\u2019t necessarily expected to successfully print the model, given that the force of the printing process damages some cells. But by using certain techniques, the researchers found they could preserve 90 percent of the cells while printing the model. Such advances in 3D-printing technology has allowed scientists to create these and similar models as an improvement on cell culturing.\n\n\u201cComparisons of 3D and 2D results revealed that Hela cells showed a higher proliferation rate in the printed 3D environment and tended to form cellular spheroids, but formed monolayer cell sheets in 2D culture,\u201d Wei and his partners wrote in the study. \u201cHela cells in 3D printed models also showed higher MMP protein expression and higher chemoresistance than those in 2D culture.\u201d\n\nThese new techniques in printing biologically live tumor models may \u201chelp the evolution\u201d of 3D cancer study, Wei says.\n\nSource: Zhao, Yu, Yao, Rui, Ouyang, Liliang, King, Hongxu, , Zhang, Ting, Sun, Wei, et al.
