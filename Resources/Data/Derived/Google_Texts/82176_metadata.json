Here\u2019s another edition of my weekend column for WPRI.com \u2013 as always, send your takes, tips and trial balloons to tnesi@wpri.com, and follow @tednesi on Twitter.\n\n1. GE might actually move its headquarters to Rhode Island. Can you believe that? Many Rhode Islanders probably can\u2019t, between the state\u2019s low self-esteem and its long economic woes. Believe it or not, though, it\u2019s become clear GE CEO Jeff Immelt is giving serious consideration to the pitch Governor Raimondo has been making since his company first expressed a desire to depart tax-happy Connecticut. Those close to the talks have stayed extremely tight-lipped, but Connecticut lawmaker John Frey\u2019s comments to the Hartford Courant this week were telling: \u201cRhode Island wouldn\u2019t surprise me. It\u2019s been expressed to me by a couple of people at GE that they\u2019ve been impressed by what the governor has done with state employee liabilities. \u2026 Their feeling is that if she tackled these things \u2026 her likelihood of coming back to the corporations for a tax increase are less.\u201d (GE spokesman Seth Martin declined to comment on Rhode Island\u2019s chances.) Luring Thomas Edison\u2019s $300-billion industrial icon over the border would be a massive coup for Raimondo, generating international press coverage about why the nation\u2019s smallest state was the right choice for the eighth-biggest company on the Fortune 500. Don\u2019t forget: Rhode Island now has the lowest corporate tax rate in New England and has lately lowered its income and estate tax rates, as well. For GE\u2019s corporate staff, moving to Rhode Island would be a lot less of a lifestyle change than moving to, say, Texas. And it\u2019s only a short helicopter ride from here to Manhattan. Don\u2019t count your chickens \u2013 it\u2019s far from a done deal \u2013 but don\u2019t be shocked if GE chooses Rhode Island, either.\n\n2. The most interesting mini-story in Rhode Island\u2019s Syrian refugees debate this week may have been Jim Langevin breaking with President Obama (and David Cicilline) on Thursday to back the House GOP bill on the matter. Langevin has always been a relatively moderate Democrat \u2013 he\u2019s still avowedly pro-life, after all \u2013 and he serves on two committees, Armed Services and Homeland Security, that lend themselves to hawkishness on national security. Nevertheless, it was a striking break with liberal orthodoxy during a week when many on the left were comparing the present treatment of Syrians with that of German Jews in the 1930s. And the backlash was swift. \u201cObjectively speaking, I know we\u2019ve seen bigger betrayals from most elected Democratic politicians in Rhode Island,\u201d Sam Bell of the Rhode Island Progressive Democrats wrote on Facebook. \u201cBut I still find Congressman Langevin\u2019s vote for the GOP\u2019s disgustingly racist anti-refugee bill nothing short of revolting.\u201d Added Providence Rep. Aaron Regunberg (whose grandfather escaped the Nazis by seeking refuge in the Philippines): \u201cSMH Congressman Jim Langevin \u2013 your vote was a disgrace to the state Roger Williams founded, and you know it.\u201d GOP Chairman Brandon Bell, by contrast, publicly thanked Langevin for his vote. Progressives have failed to defeat Langevin in the past despite their frustrations with him, and he appears to have public opinion on his side. He argued the GOP bill \u201cwill provide a reasonable new layer of assurance,\u201d and defended his support for it: \u201cI do not believe that protecting our national security precludes us from showing compassion to the refugees fleeing unspeakable violence and oppression in Syria, Iraq and other conflict zones.\u201d\n\n3. Hopkinton Sen. Elaine Morgan released this statement Friday in a bid to defuse the national controversy over her email on refugees. One question now: does this do any political damage to Morgan, who could face a 2016 rematch against Democrat Catherine Cool Rumsey in a presidential year, which means higher Democratic turnout?\n\n4. Senator Morgan\u2019s week in the headlines shines a spotlight on Rhode Island\u2019s very tiny Senate Republican caucus, which is down to four members after the sudden retirement of Chris Ottiano (unless you count independent Ed O\u2019Neill). Westerly Republican Dennis Algiere has been Senate minority leader for nearly 19 years now, but his style and views are quite different from his three remaining GOP colleagues, none of whom were in office before 2010: Morgan, Nick Kettle and Mark Gee. To take one example, Algiere was the only one of the four who voted for Governor Raimondo\u2019s truck-toll proposal last June; he even served on Raimondo\u2019s transition team last fall. He also has a strong working relationship with Teresa Paiva Weed and other Senate Democratic leaders, something they would argue benefits the minority caucus but that can frustrate conservatives who want to see stronger opposition in the chamber. It will be interesting to see how much longer Kettle, Gee and Morgan want to be led by Algiere; all eyes will be on Kettle if there\u2019s real appetite for a change.\n\n5. Governor Raimondo\u2019s first-ever approval rating: 46%. While the polling methodology used was unorthodox \u2013 the survey of 411 voters was conducted over the course of six months \u2013 the results don\u2019t look unreasonable. It will be interesting to see what her numbers look like in the first traditional poll that eventually tabulates them.\n\n6. Rhode Island\u2019s health care landscape is undergoing some big changes as 2015 winds down. The week\u2019s biggest announcement was the proposed hospital merger between Care New England and New Bedford\u2019s Southcoast Health System, which would create a regional giant with more revenue and employees than Lifespan \u2013 and, depending on where their new headquarters ends up, could see an independent Rhode Island-based company subsumed into a Massachusetts-based one. That\u2019s a worry for Rhode Island policymakers like Governor Raimondo and Senator Whitehouse, who don\u2019t want the state\u2019s top health providers to become arms of bigger Boston groups; the merged group could be a juicy takeover target for, say, Partners. It\u2019s also a worry for Lifespan, which Care New England spurned despite political pressure (and which Care New England CEO Dennis Keefe hinted to me did not exactly present itself as an appealing partner). Separately, there was the news that Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Rhode Island is outsourcing its IT functions, a move that will impact one-third of its work force \u2013 and an admission that the local insurer doesn\u2019t have the resources it needs to keep up with necessary technology investments. On a smaller scale, this week\u2019s Executive Suite featured Home Care & Hospice of New England CEO Diana Franchitto talking about her group\u2019s coming merger with Cape Cod\u2019s HopeHealth \u2013 which, as with Care New England-Southcoast, is an effort to create a sizable organization that cuts across the state borders of southeastern New England. \u201cThis kind of consolidation is happening all over the country \u2013 it\u2019s actually been a little slower to happen in the Northeast, and New England in particular,\u201d Keefe told me Monday. \u201cThe incentives in the Affordable Care Act, in Obamacare, have really created this really strong need to develop scale.\u201d\n\n7. Treasurer Magaziner showed this week he\u2019s not afraid to make some big changes at Treasury. The first was a bit of a foregone conclusion: the post-38 Studios replacement of First Southwest (and with it, the highly influential Maureen Gurghigian) as the state\u2019s financial adviser. The other was more of a surprise: the replacement of AllianceBernstein as the company in charge of Rhode Island\u2019s huge 529 plan, the CollegeBoundfund. While AllianceBernstein has come under criticism for the plan\u2019s fees and performance, the company had bureaucratic inertia in its favor after 15 years running the plan. But Magaziner\u2019s team decided the offer from Invesco and Ascensus, including a new 35-person Rhode Island office, was too good to pass up.\n\n8. Keep an eye on the drama at Brown University, part of a larger national wave of student unrest at campuses across the country. The latest salvos came this week, when a group of graduate students put out a list of demands that included cracking down on academic departments with an \u201canti-Black pedagogy.\u201d That led to a sharp rebuke from prominent Brown economist Glenn Loury, who is black himself; he declared that the students\u2019 demands are \u201ca step onto a slippery slope that slides down into intellectual mediocrity, and I will have nothing to do with them.\u201d The Daily Beast\u2019s Emily Shire also published a harsh critique of Brown\u2019s student protesters. Suffice to say this probably wasn\u2019t the sort of atmosphere Christina Paxson was hoping for when she kicked off the university\u2019s $3-billion capital campaign last month.\n\n9. Alon Levy says 95% cost savings are possible on the $290-billion Northeast Corridor rail upgrade plan if advocates push back at policymakers, which could open the door to high-speed rail service in many places. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer a question of political will; it\u2019s purely a question of cost control,\u201d he writes.\n\n10. Our weekly Saturday Morning Post dispatch from WPRI.com\u2019s Dan McGowan: \u201cHow serious is Governor Raimondo treating this week\u2019s PARCC results? \u2018It\u2019s like \u2018Truth in Numbers,\u2019\u2019 Raimondo said Friday, referring to the 2011 report she released on the state\u2019s pension system that paved the way for a dramatic overhaul. Raimondo made it clear she believes the poor scores \u2013 36% of Rhode Island students are on grade level in English and 25% are on track in math \u2013 \u2018just confirms what the [National Assessment of Educational Progress] or the remediation rates at CCRI tell us.\u2019 She acknowledged that there\u2019s a good chance Rhode Island students will see natural improvement on the exam as they get more comfortable taking it on computers, but said that doesn\u2019t explain results \u2018that make you want to cry.\u2019 Despite the concern, Raimondo isn\u2019t fully committing to using PARCC results as a graduation requirement beginning with the class of 2020. (Even with no cut score in place yet, various groups are already calling for the state to avoid tying a high-school diploma to PARCC.) Raimondo said she believes the PARCC results are accurate and said it would be a \u2018big mistake\u2019 if the General Assembly attempts to take some kind of action against the test this year, but also said she agrees with Education Commissioner Ken Wagner that students should have the option of using multiple assessments to prove they are college- or career-ready by the 12th grade.\u201d\n\n11. Don\u2019t miss Dan McGowan\u2019s 12 things you should know about the PARCC scores.\n\n12. Congratulations and best wishes to Seth Larson, who is leaving as Senator Whitehouse\u2019s communications director to take a job with the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s Office of the Under Secretary for Science and Energy. Seth \u2013 a Rhode Island native who\u2019s been with Whitehouse since the senator\u2019s 2006 campaign \u2013 is consistently hardworking, conscientious, good-humored and gracious. He understood what all good communications staffers do: the politician may pay your salary, but you really work for the reporters. (Just kidding! Sort of.) Good luck to Caleb Gibson, Whitehouse\u2019s longtime deputy communications director, who is now stepping into Larson\u2019s shoes.\n\n13. Check out this cool project \u2013 with some great vintage photographs \u2013 on the late Rhode Island Congressman John Fogarty, once described by historian Patrick Conley as having \u201chad more impact on the world than any other Rhode Island political figure.\u201d (Side note: the Providence College archivist mentioned in that article, Matthew J. Smith, also served as Rhode Island\u2019s House speaker from 1980 to 1988.)\n\n14. No surprise that Rhode Island\u2019s own Ian Prior, now working for conservative advocacy group American Crossroads, went out of his way to knock Hillary Clinton for holding a fundraiser at the NFL\u2019s Deflategate law firm.\n\n15.
