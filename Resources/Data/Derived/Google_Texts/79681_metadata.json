Switch positions? The Broncos drafted Bolden just last year in the fourth round as a cornerback. Now they wanted him to play safety.\n\n\u201cI tried not to focus on what it meant,\u201d Bolden said. \u201cI tried to control what I could control, which is do the best I can on the field. It crossed my mind but at the end of the day I\u2019m a ballplayer.\u201d\n\nBolden switched spots with veteran Quentin Jammer, who went from safety back to his natural left cornerback position. As it turned out, they both made it. The Broncos kept a whopping 11 defensive backs.\n\nWhen did Bolden realize he made the team?\n\n\u201cWhen you don\u2019t hear the phone ring, it\u2019s good,\u201d he said. \u201cNo news is good news.\u201d\n\nBroncos roster by position\n\nOFFENSE\n\nQuarterbacks (3):Peyton Manning, Brock Osweiler, Zac Dysert.\n\nManning has 244 more career starts than his two backups combined.\n\nRunning backs (5): Montee Ball, Ronnie Hillman, Knowshon Moreno, Jacob Hester, C.J. Anderson.\n\nYouth won out in Anderson making it instead of Lance Ball.\n\nReceivers (4): Demaryius Thomas, Wes Welker, Eric Decker, Andre Caldwell.\n\nThe first three have a chance to statistically approach the top trio tandems in NFL history.\n\nTight ends (4): Julius Thomas, Virgil Green, Joel Dreessen, Jacob Tamme.\n\nSame group as last year. Only Thomas and Green get most of the early playing time.\n\nOffensive linemen (9): Ryan Clady, Zane Beadles, Manny Ramirez, Louis Vasquez, Orlando Franklin, Chris Clark, John Moffitt, Chris Kuper, Steve Vallos.\n\nClark is the only backup tackle. Beadles would be fourth tackle.\n\nSpecialists (4): Matt Prater, Britton Colquitt, Aaron Brewer, Trindon Holliday.\n\nHolliday could also be listed as fifth receiver.\n\nDEFENSE\n\nDefensive backs (11): Champ Bailey, Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie, Chris Harris, Tony Carter, Kayvon Webster, Quentin Jammer, Rahim Moore, Duke Ihenacho, Mike Adams, David Bruton, Omar Bolden.\n\nEven with Bailey\u2019s iffy status against Baltimore, secondary should be better with addition of Rodgers-Cromartie and emergence of Ihenacho.\n\nDefensive linemen (8): Derek Wolfe, Robert Ayers, Shaun Phillips, Malik Jackson, Sylvester Williams, Kevin Vickerson, Terrance Knighton, Mitch Unrein.\n\nWolfe and Williams were the Broncos\u2019 top picks of the past two drafts.\n\nLinebackers (5): Wesley Woodyard, Danny Trevathan, Nate Irving, Paris Lenon, Steven Johnson.\n\nVon Miller on reserve/suspended list. Lenon could be this year\u2019s Keith Brooking.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Position switch secures job for Omar Bolden", "title": "Position switch secures job for Omar Bolden", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/08/31/position-switch-secures-job-for-omar-bolden/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130830__omar-bolden-broncos-083013p1.jpg", "height": 420}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130830__omar-bolden-broncos-083013p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2013-08-31T19:59:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-30T04:53:59+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfbb3\"", "article_summary": "The final roster cuts were a week away and the Broncos wanted him to do what?\nDEFENSEDefensive backs (11): Champ Bailey, Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie, Chris Harris, Tony Carter, Kayvon Webster, Quentin Jammer, Rahim Moore, Duke Ihenacho, Mike Adams, David Bruton, Omar Bolden.\nThe Broncos drafted Bolden just last year in the fourth round as a cornerback.\nOffensive linemen (9): Ryan Clady, Zane Beadles, Manny Ramirez, Louis Vasquez, Orlando Franklin, Chris Clark, John Moffitt, Chris Kuper, Steve Vallos.\nForgive Omar Bolden if worry seeped into his otherwise ever-positive attitude."}
