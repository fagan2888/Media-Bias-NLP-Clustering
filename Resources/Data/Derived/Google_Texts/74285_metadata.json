The band will march to tunes of their Portuguese ancestors. The Five Wounds Community of East San Jose will gather in the newly built town square. It\u2019s all to celebrate the opening of a new BART station at Alum Rock named after a nearby avenue.Fourteen years ago, the Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) proposed bringing four BART stations to the San Jose area, including one to the Five Wounds Community, a neighborhood mostly of Portuguese immigrants that has few public transportation options. Since then, \u201cLittle Portugal,\u201d as it is called, has spent over a decade preparing for the station by constructing an urban village plan residents are banking on to revitalize the area with hundreds of new housing units and thousands of new jobs.But on Oct. 6, the Five Wounds Community received devastating news after a transportation blogger spotted a VTA meeting agenda online proposing removing the station from a federal funding application that was to cover the bulk of the construction costs.\u201cIt was like a shot in the heart,\u201d resident Joan Rivas-Cosby said. \u201cI feel almost as if my husband had gone out and had an affair \u2026 How could they be so disrespectful?\u201dVTA said it considered scaling back its plans for four new stations to two because of a 2012 federal transportation bill that makes it harder to secure funding for such projects.After considering project costs, how profitable the station would be and ridership projections, VTA said a more modest two-station proposal would increase their chances of securing a federal grant. So they began considering a proposal to keep only two locations in downtown San Jose.VTA had planned to turn in its application by the end of the year. But community protests prompted them to postpone submission.\u201cWe\u2019re in a new climate now with the federal government,\u201d said Brent Pearse, VTA\u2019s community outreach supervisor. \u201cI think though, as an agency, we\u2019ve heard from the community. We want a 28th Street Alum Rock station in the project.\u201dAlthough all four stations will now undergo an Environmental Impact Report \u2014 keeping the hope of the Alum Rock station alive \u2014 East San Jose residents, like Cosby, remain unsure about the future.\n\nWhen Cosby first moved to the Five Wounds Community 40 years ago, her mother was horrified.\n\nNever giving anyone straight directions to her house, Cosby would lead visitors down side streets, circumventing specific areas of town \u2014 preventing her friends and family from seeing the underserved parts of the neighborhood she calls home.The Five Wounds Community, once comprised mostly of Portuguese immigrants, is now predominately Latino. Small single-family homes line the streets of an otherwise mostly low-income, largely industrial area near Highway 101 and just two miles east of downtown San Jose.Besides the Five Wounds Church, \u201cAll we have is the McDonalds,\u201d Cosby said. \u201cIt\u2019s sad. It can be so much better. And it will be one day.\u201dTerry Christensen, a professor of state and local politics at San Jose State University, is the founding executive director of CommUniverCity San Jose \u2014 a partnership between the City of San Jose, San Jose State University and the surrounding neighborhoods that partners engineering students with community residents in planning projects to support neighborhood-driven goals.Christensen said the BART station at Alum Rock had the city\u2019s support as well.In 2000, then San Jose Mayor Ron Gonzales implemented the Strong Neighborhoods Initiative, a plan to redevelop neglected San Jose neighborhoods. The Five Wounds Community submitted a list of priorities for their neighborhood. Because of VTA\u2019s project announcement to bring BART stations to San Jose, at the top of the Five Wounds Community\u2019s list was the urban village surrounding their proposed BART station.\n\nLast year, the San Jose City Council integrated the community\u2019s urban village with \u201cEnvision 2040,\u201d San Jose\u2019s new general plan.\n\nSo the community was on board. The city was on board. Even university students and others neighborhood outsiders got on board, Christensen said.More than 100 of Christensen\u2019s CommUniverCity urban planning students from San Jose State spent more than 1,000 hours of working with anyone that may be potentially affected by the BART station.With Styrofoam and Legos on countless Saturday mornings, university students sat alongside kids and seniors building several model villages that were incorporated into the final plan.Community resident Davide Vieira, who has lived on the same block of the Five Wounds neighborhood for 43 years, recalled when at one planning event a high school student suggested a Portuguese-inspired town square.\u201cAlmost every village in the Azores in every town in Portugal has a town square, a meeting place,\u201d Vieira said as he sat in the KSQQ offices, the East San Jose radio station that was started by his father in the 1960s. \u201cThe student envisioned our cultural marching bands performing in the center of the plaza, like they do back home.\u201dVieira said federal funding remained essential to the project\u2019s future.\u201cThose dollars would be most effectively spent here, on public transit for people who need and use it the most,\u201d Vieira said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about the station adding jobs here. It\u2019s about the opportunity to jump on the BART train and have opportunities wherever BART can take you.\u201d\n\nIn 2000 and 2012, voters passed tax measures that included funding for the future BART station. But VTA says tax revenue from the measures \u2014 which initially was thought to cover substantial project costs \u2014 would actually contribute very little.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been sold a bill of goods, we bought it twice and now going forward we will be asked in 2016 \u2014 with all certainty \u2014 to pass another tax measure. To again fund the same things we\u2019ve already funded,\u201d Vieira said. \u201cAt some point, we\u2019ve got to see stations being built.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Peninsula Press", "description": "East San Jose residents remain unsure whether the proposed Alum Rock BART station will become a reality or not.", "title": "Small San Jose community heartbroken with promised BART station in danger - Peninsula Press", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://peninsulapress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/IMG_8815-copy.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-12-15T08:04:12+00:00", "url": "http://peninsulapress.com/2014/12/11/san-jose-alum-rock-bart-station/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PeninsuPress", "section": "Transportation", "tag": "Valley Transportation Authority", "published_time": "2014-12-11T13:00:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-15T08:04:12+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "East San Jose residents remain unsure whether the proposed Alum Rock BART station will become a reality or not.", "title": "Small San Jose community heartbroken with promised BART station in danger - Peninsula Press", "image": "http://peninsulapress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/IMG_8815-copy.jpg", "creator": "@PeninsuPress", "site": "@PeninsuPress", "card": "summary"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "generator": "WordPress 4.2.4"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddf20\"", "article_summary": "Last year, the San Jose City Council integrated the community\u2019s urban village with \u201cEnvision 2040,\u201d San Jose\u2019s new general plan.\nThe Five Wounds Community of East San Jose will gather in the newly built town square.\nBecause of VTA\u2019s project announcement to bring BART stations to San Jose, at the top of the Five Wounds Community\u2019s list was the urban village surrounding their proposed BART station.\nAnd it will be one day.\u201dTerry Christensen, a professor of state and local politics at San Jose State University, is the founding executive director of CommUniverCity San Jose \u2014 a partnership between the City of San Jose, San Jose State University and the surrounding neighborhoods that partners engineering students with community residents in planning projects to support neighborhood-driven goals.Christensen said the BART station at Alum Rock had the city\u2019s support as well.In 2000, then San Jose Mayor Ron Gonzales implemented the Strong Neighborhoods Initiative, a plan to redevelop neglected San Jose neighborhoods.\nIt\u2019s about the opportunity to jump on the BART train and have opportunities wherever BART can take you.\u201dIn 2000 and 2012, voters passed tax measures that included funding for the future BART station."}
