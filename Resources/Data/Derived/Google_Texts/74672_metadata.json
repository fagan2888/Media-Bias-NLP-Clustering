Republicans and Democrats have fought over domestic and defense spending levels for the coming year, new highway spending authority and conservative efforts to slash funding for Planned Parenthood and the Affordable Care Act.\n\nRelated: McConnell Vows to Avoid Another Debt Ceiling Crisis\n\nWhile the difference between Lew\u2019s statement and the CBO prediction may seem small, even a few weeks can be an eternity on Capitol Hill in trying to work out a final agreement \u2013 especially with only roughly 60 legislative days left in the congressional calendar for the remainder of the year.\n\nAnd with Congress riven by partisan and ideological divisions that often lead to political brinksmanship, House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) may have to pass a short-term continuing resolution to keep the government operating beyond the Oct. 1 start of the new fiscal year. That means lawmakers and the White House could well be slugging it out through the December holidays.\n\nThe debt ceiling is the legal limit on how much the Treasury can borrow to pay debts already incurred by Congress; it is not a license to spend additional funds. Even so, opponents of raising the debt often argue that the debt ceiling is symbolic of runaway government spending and should not be increased.\n\nThe latest tensions began in March when a debt ceiling limit of $18.1 trillion kicked back in after Congress had temporarily suspended it last year as part of a budget agreement.\n\nRelated: U.S. Begins Measures to Buy Time Under Debt Limit\n\nSteve Bell, senior director of economic policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center, said yesterday that he hoped this fall\u2019s congressional debate over spending bills, the debt and other fiscal matters \u201cmay lead to larger consideration of a long-term debt stabilization bill.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the meantime, policy makers should take into account the evidence that delaying action on the debt limit can adversely affect markets and out economy,\u201d Bell said in a statement.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "It may not amount to a lot more time, but the Congressional Budget Office may have jus", "title": "Why the New Debt Ceiling Deadline Could Be Crucial", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/08/26/Why-New-Debt-Ceiling-Deadline-Could-Be-Crucial", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/01032013_Debt_Ceiling_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/08/26/Why-New-Debt-Ceiling-Deadline-Could-Be-Crucial", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/01032013_Debt_Ceiling_article.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "It may not amount to a lot more time, but the Congressional Budget Office may have jus", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Even so, opponents of raising the debt often argue that the debt ceiling is symbolic of runaway government spending and should not be increased.\nFears of provoking yet another debt ceiling crisis that would threaten a first-ever default on U.S. borrowing have hung over Washington for months.\nThe latest tensions began in March when a debt ceiling limit of $18.1 trillion kicked back in after Congress had temporarily suspended it last year as part of a budget agreement.\nThe debt ceiling is the legal limit on how much the Treasury can borrow to pay debts already incurred by Congress; it is not a license to spend additional funds.\nRelated: The Next Debt Crisis Could Be Much Worse than in 2013, GAO WarnsIn July, Lew warned Congress that the government\u2019s use of \u201cextraordinary measures\u201d to continue to finance the government on a temporary basis without breaching the current $18.1 trillion debt ceiling would last through Oct. 30."}
