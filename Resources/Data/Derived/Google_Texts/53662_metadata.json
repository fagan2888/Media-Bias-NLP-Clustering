But a political scientist says it\u2019s unsurprising that a Kentucky Democrat would skip a visit to the state by the party\u2019s national leader.\n\nObama, who will talk about the economy in Kentucky\u2019s largest city, has been unpopular in Kentucky and state Democrats have distanced themselves from the president in recent years.\n\nState politicians distance themselves from the president to avoid losing favor with more conservative Democrats across the state, said Dewey Clayton, a political science professor at the University of Louisville.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re trying to attract them then clearly you\u2019re going to have to portray a face to them that\u2019s not cozying up to the so-called liberal bastions in the party starting with President Obama,\u201d Clayton said.\n\nObama overwhelming lost to his rivals in Kentucky in the last two presidential elections. The state tends to skew toward the GOP in federal elections and elects mostly Democratic candidates in statewide races. The state\u2019s governor is a Democrat and the state House is controlled by the party, but Republicans make up seven of eight members of the state\u2019s federal delegation.\n\nDuring the Kentucky U.S. Senate race in 2014, Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes famously refused to say whether she voted for Obama. Grimes lost the race to incumbent Republican Mitch McConnell by a wide margin.\n\nThat\u2019s the impulse of Kentucky Democrats\u2014steer clear of the president, Clayton said. But that impulse may not be advisable.\n\n\u201cI kind of think that some of this distancing themselves from the president is not always the best thing to do. Particularly, there are a lot of policies and programs that he has initiated and he supports that many Kentuckians support as well,\u201d Clayton said.\n\nPolls show that Obama\u2019s signature achievement\u2014the Affordable Care Act\u2014isn\u2019t popular, but 500,000 Kentuckians have signed up for health insurance through Kynect, the state-run health exchange implemented through the legislation.\n\nObama\u2019s environmental priorities have been unpopular in the state, especially the implementation of more stringent carbon regulations.\n\nState Republicans often try to draw the connection between Obama and Kentucky Democratic candidates. Republican National Committee spokesman Raffi Williams called Conway\u2019s absence from the event on Thursday \u201cconspicuous.\u201d\n\n\u201cJack Conway is obviously just another Kentucky Democrat candidate who doesn\u2019t have the courage to tell Kentuckians the truth about his support for Barack Obama and his liberal agenda,\u201d Williams said in a statement.\n\nState Democrats, including Grimes in her 2014 campaign, have found themselves in the awkward position of opposing the national Democrats\u2019 platform and courting those who worry that carbon policies amount to a fatal blow to the already crippled coal industry.\n\nLast week Conway received an endorsement from the United Mine Workers Association, partly for \u201cstanding up to the EPA to protect jobs and keep miners working.\u201d\n\nIn his capacity as Attorney General, Conway joined a multi-state lawsuit against the EPA\u2019s proposed carbon regulations.\n\nKentucky has voted for Republican presidential candidates since George W. Bush\u2019s first campaign in 2000. The state has also had a majority of Republican congressmen and senators since the mid-1990s.\n\nBut only one other Republican has been elected Kentucky governor since Louie Nunn in 1968, and Kentucky Democrats have fought off repeated Republican attempts to control the state House.\n\n\u201cKentucky voters view state and federal elections very differently\u2014it\u2019s really like comparing apples to oranges,\u201d said David Bertstein with the Kentucky Democratic Party in an email.\n\n\u201cOur message this year of standing up to big special interests and fighting to put Kentucky families first resonates with voters across the political spectrum, which is the real reason why Kentucky Democratic candidates will win in November.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics", "description": "Presumptive Democratic gubernatorial nominee Jack Conway won\u2019t attend President Obama\u2019s visit to Louisville on Thursday.
