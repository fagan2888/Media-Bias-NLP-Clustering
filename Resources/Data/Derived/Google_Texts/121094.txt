Veteran Hollywood composer William Goldstein has written a strong response to critics of the Academy Awards.

Since the Oscars were announced January 14, actors, directors and members of the media have argued that the awards lack diversity. All of the acting nominees in 2016 are white.

Actors Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith and director Spike Lee have announced that they are boycotting the February 28 ceremony. The hashtag #OscarsSoWhite is being used on Twitter, and President Obama called for greater diversity. In the wake of the controversy the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences initiated changes that it hopes will double the number of women and minority members by 2020.

Writing in the Los Angeles Times, Goldstein, a longtime academy member and composer with over 50 film credits, argued that Hollywood is a meritocracy and that the people criticizing the Oscars are misguided: "In case it's not obvious, the point is to purge older (presumably white) members and create something akin to affirmative action for new members."
