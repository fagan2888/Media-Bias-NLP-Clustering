He won\u2019t be the first gay player in professional football, for sure, but he\u2019ll be the first one to declare so openly. And the best part? The reaction has been mostly positive, even in places you might expect to be full of negativity. Among the first to announce their support publicly were officials at the NFL league offices and Seattle Seahawks linebacker Malcolm Smith, who just happens to be the reigning Super Bowl MVP. \u201cThere is no room for bigotry in American sports,\u201d Smith tweeted. \u201cIt takes courage to change the culture.\u201d\n\nYes, some players groused and a bunch of anonymous NFL insiders gave Sports Illustrated quotes warning that Sam would struggle and disrupt locker-room chemistry. But the anonymity of those comments were quite a tell\u2014once upon a time, not so long ago, an NFL scout or general manager wouldn\u2019t think twice about suggesting a gay player had no place in professional sports. Better still, the supposition itself was transparently thin on evidence. Sam had told his University of Missouri teammates about his sexual orientation before the season started. They handled it just fine, as my colleague Marc Tracy noted, respecting Sam\u2019s privacy (he wasn't yet ready to make a public statement) and advancing with him to the Conference Championship. As if to erase any doubt, one of sam\u2019s former teammates, linebacker Kentrell Brothers, tweeted his own statement of support: \u201cIt takes a lot of courage to do what he did. And we are behind him all the way.\u201d\n\nThe announcement was so big that it also got attention in the political world. First Lady Michelle Obama and Vice President Joe Biden each issued personally signed tweets praising Sam. So did several Democratic senators, including Clare McCaskill of Missouri. But do you know who hasn\u2019t made a statement? Missouri\u2019s other senator, the Republican\u2014Roy Blunt. And there\u2019s been a similarly odd split in the media. Pretty much every left-of-center publication has weighed in\u2014Mother Jones, the Nation, and the American Prospect all had something to say. There appears to be nothing at National Review or the Weekly Standard. The Fox News seems similarly bereft of commentary.\n\nIn fact, the only conservative punditry on Sam I\u2019ve seen was an odd, if predictably unpleasant, rant from Rush Limbaugh.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Michael Sam\u2019s announcement that he is gay is a watershed moment.
