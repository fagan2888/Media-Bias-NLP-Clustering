But his father had nothing to do with these million-to-one odds.\n\nFamily sits with their three identical sons and new brothers. Photo courtesy of Facebook\n\nThere is only one genetic factor that can explain why certain family lines tend to have more twins than others: hyperovulation. When a woman releases multiple eggs during ovulation, it increases the chance of conceiving fraternal twins. However, only women can carry the odds for hyperovulation because women are the ones who ovulate, not men. If the mother\u2019s side of the family carried the gene, it could only be passed down through the daughters in order for there to be an increase in odds, according to About Health.\n\nJase\u2019s identical sons are a complete chance, and he\u2019s already thinking of all the mischief they could get into. \u201cThey can scheme together and get it figured out to where, \u2018OK, you're better at math, so you go to my math class, and you go to my math class, and I'll go to English, 'cause I'm better at English,\u2019\u201d Jase said.\n\nThey will be able to enjoy their rare opportunities to fool others, since Cade, Ian, and Milo were all born healthy at 32 weeks. Even though the first born was placed in the intensive care unit, it is not unusual to place a twin or triplet there until his breathing and heartrate remains stable. Being born as identical triplets means their mother\u2019s egg was divided evenly into three parts. A non-identical fraternal twin or triplet, is more common because they are born from their own egg but have been fertilized at the same time and share a womb.\n\n\u201cTo have a patient with spontaneous identical triplets is incredibly rare,\u201d said maternal fetal medicine physician Dr. Dana Damron, who works at the Billings Clinic where the triplets were delivered. \u201cWhen you see a patient with triplets, you take a deep breath and realize all sorts of complications that can occur. But when it turns out well in the end, it\u2019s one of the most amazing experiences.\u201d\n\nThe triplet\u2019s mother Jody is happy, healthy, and looking forward to bringing them back home to their 6-year-old big brother Jax. \u201cIt\u2019ll be nice to get them all home and get a routine figured out,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "doctor, calls, identical, triplets, one, million, science, triplets", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "One of the rarest births came last month when a mother delivered identical triplets naturally without IVF treatments.", "title": "Identical Triplets Born Without Fertility Treatment Are 'One In A Million'", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/doctor-calls-identical-triplets-one-million-science-triplets-317316", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2015/01/12/rare-triples-born-healthy.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "One of the rarest births came last month when a mother delivered identical triplets naturally without IVF treatments.", "title": "Identical Triplets Born Without Fertility Treatment Are 'One In A Million'", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/doctor-calls-identical-triplets-one-million-science-triplets-317316", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2015/01/12/rare-triples-born-healthy.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/01/12/rare-triples-born-healthy.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Weird Medicine", "published_time": "2015-01-12T11:20:30-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-12T11:20:28-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "One of the rarest births came last month when a mother delivered identical triplets naturally without IVF treatments."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2a08\"", "article_summary": "Being born as identical triplets means their mother\u2019s egg was divided evenly into three parts.\n\u201cTo have a patient with spontaneous identical triplets is incredibly rare,\u201d said maternal fetal medicine physician Dr. Dana Damron, who works at the Billings Clinic where the triplets were delivered.\n\u201cMy dad's a multiple,\u201d the 29-year-old father Jase Kinsey told the Billings Gazette.\nThey will be able to enjoy their rare opportunities to fool others, since Cade, Ian, and Milo were all born healthy at 32 weeks.\nJase\u2019s identical sons are a complete chance, and he\u2019s already thinking of all the mischief they could get into."}
