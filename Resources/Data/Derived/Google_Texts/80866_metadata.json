Right after you\u2019ve chowed down on all your Valentine\u2019s Day chocolates, the following day will be the last time you can sign up for Obamacare this year. Just ask Vice President Joe Biden: \u201cIf you don\u2019t sign up by the 15th of this year, you\u2019re going to have to wait till 2016 to get health insurance through the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nBut before you rush over to the Healthcare.gov site to snag a healthcare plan, we thought it would be a great idea to let you know the progress of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) \u2014 by the numbers.\n\nNow before we get into the stats, do you know what Obamacare is all about? According to HealthDay, 64 percent are a bit hazy about health care mandate. To demystify the ACA for you, here\u2019s a quick run-down: Obamacare became \u201cthe Law of the Land\u201d in 2012 and its goal is to provide accessible, quality, affordable healthcare plans for all. In a nutshell, healthcare premiums are dependent on your income level. Subsidies are available for American households who are between one and four times the Federal Poverty Level.\n\nIf you are uninsured, and you choose to not get healthinsurance (and you\u2019re not exempt) you\u2019ll penalized right where it hurts \u2014 your pockets. You\u2019ll have to give up two percent of your income or $325 per adult and $162.50 per child. Right, now that you\u2019re informed, let\u2019s get to it!\n\nA formidable 9.5 million Americans have signed up for the 2015 healthcare plans as of Jan. 27. According to the Washington Post. But let\u2019s put a face on who\u2019s signing up: Nearly 25 percent are between the ages of 18 and 34 and 30 percent are between 55 and 64. Eight percent of enrollees are Latino, while 11 percent were African-American \u2014 two groups that are reaping many benefits from the ACA, specifically the latter.\n\nBlack Americans, as the Center for American Progress reports, have seen their uninsured rates plummet from 24.1 percent to 16.1 percent between 2013 and 2014 thanks to the Affordable Care Act.\n\nWith Obamacare requiring five million private-insured African-American women to have access to additional healthcare benefits, HPV testing, mammograms, prenatal care \u2014 and other preventive services \u2014 will no longer be unattainable.\n\nAlmost 6.8 million African Americans have now become eligible for insurance since the implementation of the ACA.\n\nNow these figures are a stark difference from what other naysayers \u2014 namely conservatives \u2014 were saying about big ol\u2019 scary \u201cjob killer\u201d called Obamacare. This includes Forbes\u2019 2012 article, \u201cNo, Mr. President, Obamacare Will Hurt Blacks & Hispanics,\u201d TownHall\u2018s \u201cObamacare Negatively Impacts Minorities,\u201d and most recently, BloombergView\u2018s \u201cObamacare is Working. Unless You\u2019re Black.\u201d\n\nDebunking these mythological articles, The New York Times announced:\n\n\u201cThe biggest winners from the law include people between the ages of 18 and 34; blacks; Hispanics; and people who live in rural areas.\u201d\n\nCNBC delved further into the figures, quoting Gallup:\n\n\u201cThe [uninsured rate] drop has been most pronounced among black Americans and lower-income adults, the research organization said. Blacks have seen a 7 percentage-point decrease in their uninsured rate, while there has been a 6.9 percentage-point plunge in the rate among people earning less than $36,000.\u201d\n\nOverall, Obamacare helped the United States\u2019 uninsured rate plunge to its lowest levels since 1997, Business Insider reports. During the first three months of 2014, the uninsured rate dropped to 13.1 percent \u2014 a decrease of 1.3 percentage points, which reflects a decline of nearly four million uninsured Americans in the country, according to the Center for Disease Control.\n\nAnd, arguably, the most incredible result of the ACA is that more Americans are finding it easier to pay off those pesky medical bills, according to ThinkProgress. Researchers call it \u201cremarkable\u201d:\n\n\u201cFor the first time in a decade\u2026the number of people who had issues paying for health treatment dropped from 41 percent to 35 percent. The people who skipped out on health services because they couldn\u2019t afford them declined from 43 percent to 36 percent.\u201c\n\nBravo, Obamacare. Bravo.\n\nOnly time will tell if the Supreme Court will axe the ACA, but as MSNBC puts it, \u201cLet\u2019s be clear: if the Republican justices gut the law, they\u2019ll undermine a law that\u2019s working quite well.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The deadline for signing up for healthcare in 2015 is February 15.
