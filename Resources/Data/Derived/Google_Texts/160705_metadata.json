More than 13 billion gallons of this total will be met by the use of corn ethanol, the lawmakers said.The mandate has direct implications for the nation\u2019s food supply, Feinstein said.\u201cUnder the corn ethanol mandate in the RFS, roughly 44 percent of U.S. corn is diverted from food to fuel, pushing up the cost of food and animal feed and damaging the environment,\u201d she said.The lawmakers are also responding to concerns about the so-called \u201cblend wall.\u201d As U.S. gas consumption declines, refiners face a point when the RFS mandate will exceed the limit at which ethanol can be blended into the fuel supply, critics say. The result could be higher fuel prices and a gasoline blend that could damage cars, they said.The action comes a month after the Environmental Protection Agency's 2014that are lower than the 2013 requirements, an implicit acknowledgment of the concerns.The EPA is proposing to require 15.21 billion gallons in 2014, down from 16.55 billion gallons in 2013, marking the first time the agency has lowered the target from the prior year.The legislation introduced Thursday would remove the top-line mandate for renewable fuels, but leave mandates for non-corn ethanol advanced biofuels in place.The American Petroleum Institute, which has called for an outright repeal of the Renewable Fuel Standard, heralded the bill.\u201cRepealing corn ethanol mandates is the first step toward protecting consumers from outdated and costly public policy,\u201d API Downstream group director Bob Greco said.But the legislation drew swift rebuke from the Renewable Fuels Association. Bob Dinneen, the group\u2019s president, argued the bill comes just as the nation\u2019s farmers have finished harvesting the largest corn crop in U.S. history.\u201cThis is monumentally stupid,\u201d Dinneen said. \u201cThis legislation ought to be entitled \u2018The Oil Monopoly Protection Act of 2013.'\"Co-sponsors of the bill include Sens.(R-N.C.),(R-Maine),(R-Tenn.),(D-N.C.),(R-Ariz.),(D-W.Va.),(R-Idaho) and(R-Pa.).", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "New legislation would eliminate the ethanol portion of the federal Renewable Fuel Standard.", "description": "New legislation would eliminate the ethanol portion of the federal Renewable Fuel Standard.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Ben Goad", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "New legislation would eliminate the ethanol portion of the federal Renewable Fuel Standard.", "title": "Bipartisan push imperils ethanol mandate", "url": "http://thehill.com/regulation/energy-environment/192978-bipartisan-push-imperils-ethanol-mandate", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-02T23:19:58-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-02T23:19-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/regulation/energy-environment/192978-bipartisan-push-imperils-ethanol-mandate", "dcterms.date": "2013-12-12T14:21-05:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Ben Goad", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Renewable fuels, Ethanol, Ethanol fuel, Gasoline,Dianne Feinstein, Patrick Toomey, Susan Collins, Richard Burr, Joe Manchin, Jeff Flake, Tom Coburn, Bob Corker, Kay Hagan, Jim Risch,", "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-12T14:21:18-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-02T23:19:58-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/regulation/energy-environment/192978-bipartisan-push-imperils-ethanol-mandate", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "New legislation would eliminate the ethanol portion of the federal Renewable Fuel Standard.", "card": "summary", "title": "Bipartisan push imperils ethanol mandate"}, "dcterms.title": "Bipartisan push imperils ethanol mandate"}, "article_summary": "and(R-Okla.), thewould effectively repeal requirements for the amount of ethanol that is blended into gasoline.\u201cThe time to end the corn ethanol mandate has arrived,\u201d Coburn said in a written statement.\nA group of eight senators unveiled legislation Thursday to repeal the federal Renewable Fuel Standard\u2019s contentious ethanol mandate, saying regulations are pushing up corn prices and threatening the oil-and-gas industry.\n\u201cThis legislation ought to be entitled \u2018The Oil Monopoly Protection Act of 2013.\nBob Dinneen, the group\u2019s president, argued the bill comes just as the nation\u2019s farmers have finished harvesting the largest corn crop in U.S. history.\u201cThis is monumentally stupid,\u201d Dinneen said.\nADVERTISEMENTIntroduced by Sens.(D-Calif.)"}
