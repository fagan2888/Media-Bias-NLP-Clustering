Now, he wants to do it again, and is asking members of the National Rural Health Association to join him.\n\n\"I believe in Americans and I believe that when enough people find out the injustice that's going on, they'll do something about it,\" he said Tuesday at the association\u2019s conference in Washington.\n\n[RELATED: What Happens When a Town's Only Hospital Shuts Down?]\n\nHe and Belhaven residents, along with the state NAACP chapter, are protesting last year\u2019s closure of Vidant Pungo Hospital in Hyde County, North Carolina. But O\u2019Neal doesn\u2019t want to stop there: He wants Congress to start paying attention to the health of all rural Americans, and to help them get access to care.\n\n\u201cSome people don\u2019t care that people die,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be uncomfortable for some folks but i\u2019m going to talk about it.\u201d\n\nRural citizens in the U.S., many of whom work in agriculture, live in remote areas that are far from hospitals. This means primary care can be delayed, and families risk not being able to access emergency care when they need it.\n\n\u201cDo you know people don\u2019t have cars? A lot of people don\u2019t have cars,\u201d O'Neal said. \u201cDo you know what it\u2019s like to need a car and have to go to the hospital?\u201d\n\nIn a video presented at the conference, a Belhaven resident shared why she lived in the small town instead of moving to a city. \u201cThis is home,\u201d she said. \u201cWe may not have things in the ways of malls and departments stores and conveniences \u2013 but we have slow-paced lives and beauty and family \u2026 and it\u2019s irreplaceable.\u201d She noted as well that the existence of rural communities also allowed for people around the country to have access to food and other necessities.\n\n\n\n[SPECIAL REPORT: Healthcare of Tomorrow]\n\nBelhaven is a 1,600-person town is about 2.5 hours southeast of Raleigh, with a median income of $17,670.\n\nThe town\u2019s hospital was built in 1968 and just over three years ago was bought by Vidant Health, a large hospital system in North Carolina. Vidant shut down the hospital in July 2014, citing environmental and structural concerns and saying it would build a clinic instead. Now, the nearest hospital is 35 miles away. \u201cPeople can die getting there,\u201d O\u2019Neal said.\n\nThis story is becoming familiar for rural hospitals across the country. According to the American Hospital Association, more than a third of the nation\u2019s 5,700 hospitals are in rural areas. The National Rural Health Association says the nation is in a \"rural health crisis,\" estimating that 470 rural hospitals have closed during the past 25 years. Forty-seven of them closed during the last five years, and 283 more are in danger of closing soon, according to the association.\n\nDoctors also are scarce. According to the National Rural Health Association, a quarter of Americans live in rural areas, but only about 10 percent practice in these areas.\n\nThere also are fewer options for health insurance in rural areas. In November of last year the Urban Institute found that the largest increases in premium prices were likely to occur in rural areas.\n\n\n\n[READ: How Will Hospitals Handle the Newly Insured?]\n\nHealth disparities is only part of the problem. Severe economic costs also are at play. In many cities \u2013 both urban and rural \u2013 hospitals often are the largest employers. In Belhaven, the economic impact is estimated to be between $14 million and $16 million a year.\n\nO\u2019Neal also noted that the lack of Medicaid expansion in the state had hurt the hospital. Currently 29 states and the District of Columbia are expanding Medicaid, a provision of the Affordable Care Act that the Supreme Court made optional for states. Half a million previously uninsured North Carolinians would be covered if the state legislature and governor were to accept the funds from the federal government.\n\nIn 2013, Vidant Health CEO David Herman acknowledged to the Huffington Post that lack of Medicaid expansion in North Carolina also had played a role in shutting down the hospital.\n\nO\u2019Neal, who is a Republican, said Tuesday that expanding Medicaid in the state would have been the right thing to do. \u201cThey need to stand up and do the right thing,\u201d he said of the state government.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"usn-stitial-fact": "{\"slug\":\"160202\",\"text\":\"We all need a small amount of sodium to keep our bodies working properly \u2013 but too much is linked to heart disease.\"}", "usn-comments-mode": "facebook", "description": "Rural health leaders planning to grab attention of Congress through March to Washington.", "zone": "hospitalsoftomorrow/articles", "author": "Kimberly Leonard", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Rural health leaders planning to grab attention of Congress through March to Washington.", "title": "Small Town Mayor Pleads With Washington to Save Rural Hospitals", "url": "http://health.usnews.com/health-news/hospital-of-tomorrow/articles/2015/02/03/small-town-mayor-pleads-with-washington-to-save-rural-hospitals", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/4b/43/61810e204b3faf7d6163fb628b41/150203-mayor-editorial.JPG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Small Town Mayor Pleads With Washington to Save Rural Hospitals - US News", "description": "Rural health leaders planning to grab attention of Congress through March to Washington.", "card": "summary", "site": "@USNews"}, "usn-platform-id": "a", "site": "health-news", "keywords": "LTHealth [Consumer Advice],healthwellness [Consumer Advice],Hospital of Tomorrow,North Carolina,health care,hospitals,Kimberly Leonard", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "social_id": "http://t.usnews.com/Z6ghyf", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "published_at": "2015-02-03", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/usnewsandworldreport", "published_time": "2015-02-03"}, "usn-content-type": "article", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/151a35c/2147483647/thumbnail/80x80/quality/85/?url=%2Fcmsmedia%2F4b%2F43%2F61810e204b3faf7d6163fb628b41%2Fresizes%2F500%2F150203-mayor-editorial.JPG", "viewport": "width=980", "news_keywords": "Rural Health , Hospitals, Country, Farmers, Hospital of Tomorrow, National Rural Health Association, Vidant Health, Mayor Adam O'Neal, Belhaven North Carolina, Agriculture"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcff4d\"", "article_summary": "The National Rural Health Association says the nation is in a \"rural health crisis,\" estimating that 470 rural hospitals have closed during the past 25 years.\nNow, he wants to do it again, and is asking members of the National Rural Health Association to join him.\nAccording to the National Rural Health Association, a quarter of Americans live in rural areas, but only about 10 percent practice in these areas.\nBellhaven, N.C., Mayor Adam O'Neal speaks in front of the U.S. Capitol in 2014 to advocate on behalf of rural health care.\nIn many cities \u2013 both urban and rural \u2013 hospitals often are the largest employers."}
