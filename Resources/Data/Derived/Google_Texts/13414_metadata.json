Coulter\u2019s provocations are best treated as performance art. But there\u2019s also no doubt that she was playing on conservative insecurities about change and globalization and multiculturalism that are quite real. A generation of Americans feels its cultural-superpower primacy slipping away, replaced by something it would rather mock than understand or celebrate.\n\nIt\u2019s scary stuff! We\u2019ve got a black president and our neighbors are hooting and hollering about the World Cup. You can practically hear the pearl-clutching: What\u2019s happened to our once great nation!? And why the hell won\u2019t all these obnoxious people on Twitter just stop going on and on and on about it? Reuters columnist and confirmed curmudgeon Jack Shafer got so fed up with all the World Cup chatter that he devoted an entire column on Friday to explaining why he was unfollowing everyone who committed the sin of so much as retweeting a single Cup-obsessed comment.\n\nIt\u2019s mean and unfair to lump Shafer and Coulter in the same paragraph, but there is a connecting thread linking their disdain. Once every four years, the entire world explodes into an obsessive conversation about sports that incorporates and is inseparable from historical narratives of race and culture and nationalism. In many countries, soccer is politics. When the World Cup crests, it\u2019s the biggest thing happening on the planet.\n\nShafer doesn\u2019t want to hear that conversation. Coulter and her ilk are actively terrified of it. Because the fact that the U.S. is finally joining in is a sign that we are gradually becoming part of this world rather than lording over it or building walls to keep it out. On the pitch, Mexico is our equal, instead of a source of cheap labor and cheaper thrills. Our stars are neither the biggest nor the brightest. We can\u2019t samba like the Brazilians or pass with the crisp efficiency of the Germans.\n\nBut it\u2019s really cool that we\u2019re in the mix. Now is the worst possible time to turn down the Twitter volume. Turn it up! The jokes; the political resentments, the exultation \u2014 it\u2019s not just the sound of a truly global culture. It\u2019s the sound of the future.\n\n* * *\n\nIn the summer of 1990, I stood in Hong Kong\u2019s Central Station, staring at something I didn\u2019t understand. A live soccer game was being projected on a station wall \u2014 and hundreds of commuters had stopped to watch a couple of South American teams kick a ball around in Italy.\n\nI had been in Hong Kong for several weeks, interning at a magazine, and this was the first time I\u2019d seen anyone dawdle or linger about. There were no moments to waste in East Asia in the early \u201990s. My clearest memory from those days was of young men galloping up the escalators from the bottom of Central Station to the point where they could get reception for their brand-new (and very bulky) cellphones, and start cutting deals. Back in the States we were still figuring out fax machines.\n\nYet here was a crowd, watching Diego Maradona work his wiles against the mighty Brazil. South Korea, the only East Asian team that managed to qualify for the 1990 Cup, had already been ignominiously eliminated, manhandled with ease by Belgium, Spain and Uruguay. The cultural connection between Hong Kong and the screaming crowds 6,000 miles away seemed tenuous, at best.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ann Coulter's ridiculous World Cup claims underline conservatives' growing anxiety about our hyper-connected world", "author": "Andrew Leonard", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Ann Coulter's ridiculous World Cup claims underline conservatives' growing anxiety about our hyper-connected world", "title": "The right\u2019s absurd World Cup paranoia explained", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/29/the_rights_absurd_world_cup_paranoia_explained/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/ann_coulter_world_cup.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ann Coulter's ridiculous World Cup claims underline conservatives' growing anxiety about our hyper-connected world", "creator": "@koxinga21", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/ann_coulter_world_cup.jpg", "title": "The right\u2019s absurd World Cup paranoia explained", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "The right\u2019s absurd World Cup paranoia explained", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Ann Coulter, Globalization, Media Criticism, Nationalism, Soccer, Sports, Twitter, World Cup", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9f0f\"", "article_summary": "We\u2019ve got a black president and our neighbors are hooting and hollering about the World Cup.\nWhen the World Cup crests, it\u2019s the biggest thing happening on the planet.\nReuters columnist and confirmed curmudgeon Jack Shafer got so fed up with all the World Cup chatter that he devoted an entire column on Friday to explaining why he was unfollowing everyone who committed the sin of so much as retweeting a single Cup-obsessed comment.\nTopics: Ann Coulter, Globalization, Media Criticism, Nationalism, Soccer, Sports, Twitter, World Cup, Technology News, Media News, News, Politics NewsWith her recent column explaining how the rise of American interest in the World Cup is \u201ca sign of the nation\u2019s moral decay,\u201d Ann Coulter successfully sent readers around the world into gales of horrified laughter and generated god only knows how many hate-clicks.\nA generation of Americans feels its cultural-superpower primacy slipping away, replaced by something it would rather mock than understand or celebrate."}
