The nature of the discrimination claim asserted (e.g., race, gender, age, or disability) may impact the breadth and/or limits of a viable claim. The Final Rule applies Section 1557 across lines of business and possibly corporate entities for certain covered entities, including health insurance issuers.\n\nImportantly, HHS did not exclude Third Party Administrator (TPA) services for self-insured plans from the Final Rule. When the discrimination is alleged to have occurred in the administration of the self-insured plan, HHS will investigate the TPA directly. When the alleged discrimination is in the benefit design of the self-insured plan, HHS will process the complaint against the employer/plan sponsor and, if they do not have jurisdiction over the employer, refer the investigation to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC).\n\nOne important aspect of the Final Rule and its definitions is that TPAs that are a \u201cpart of\u201d the controlled group of a health insurance issuer that is otherwise \u201cprincipally engaged in the provision of health insurance\u201d and receiving federal funds are subject to the Final Rule. HHS recognizes that this will be a burden to insurer-affiliated TPAs in a way that it is not to standalone TPAs.\n\nHHS\u2019s approach in this Final Rule underscores the need for benefit distinctions to be supported by medical evidence. HHS confirmed that scientific or medical reasons can justify distinctions based on the grounds enumerated in Section 1557.\n\nHHS rejected the request from the insurance industry to either harmonize the Section 1557 rules with Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) rules, where applicable, or adopt a \u201cdeemed\u201d compliance approach when an entity is found compliant with other regulatory structures.\n\nThe Final Rule authorizes private causes of action for violations of Section 1557. HHS stated in the preamble that it plans to enforce Section 1557 using the enforcement mechanisms under Title VI, Title IX, Section 504, or the Age Discrimination Act with respect to recipients of federal financial assistance. The Final Rule also makes clear that this private right of enforcement includes compensatory damages.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Department of Health and Human Services Office of Civil Rights issued final rule Nondiscrimination in Health Programs and Activities on prohibitions found in Section 1557 of ACA", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "The National Law Review", "description": "On May 13, over six years after the Affordable Care Act (ACA) was passed, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office of Civil Rights issued its final rule (Nondiscrimination in Health Pr", "title": "Health and Human Services OCR Issues Long-awaited Nondiscrimination Final Rule", "url": "http://www.natlawreview.com/article/health-and-human-services-ocr-issues-long-awaited-nondiscrimination-final-rule", "image": "http://www.natlawreview.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/article/aux/1141/ACA_9.jpg?itok=0sGyUe18", "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Nation, Health, ACA, Affordable Care Act, Nondiscrimination Prohibition, Final Rule, OCR, HHS, Section 1557", "msvalidate.01": "5493B547C0AB527FF4CF8C4D0127302A", "google-site-verification": "SAKcOmA6_i0E79oG2TjlPWfOSs9kMM6EWAZNaT0aBtA", "verify-v1": "nSkrvEqyOIUMGKMak3OBIKcpcABac4XWK5NJKMuMtBY=", "y_key": "fe6cd8bd83ff0c09", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Legal, Business, Government, Nation, Health, ACA, Affordable Care Act, Nondiscrimination Prohibition, Final Rule, OCR, HHS, Section 1557"}, "article_summary": "HHS\u2019s approach in this Final Rule underscores the need for benefit distinctions to be supported by medical evidence.\nOne important aspect of the Final Rule and its definitions is that TPAs that are a \u201cpart of\u201d the controlled group of a health insurance issuer that is otherwise \u201cprincipally engaged in the provision of health insurance\u201d and receiving federal funds are subject to the Final Rule.\nThe Final Rule also makes clear that this private right of enforcement includes compensatory damages.\nThe Final Rule applies Section 1557 across lines of business and possibly corporate entities for certain covered entities, including health insurance issuers.\nThe Final Rule codifies existing nondiscrimination requirements and sets forth new standards to implement Section 1557."}
