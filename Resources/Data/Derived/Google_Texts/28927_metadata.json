A new study finds a relationship between the nightly awakenings of patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease and increased levels of orexin in their cerebrospinal fluid. \u201cThe main result of our study is the increase of the [spinal fluid] orexin levels found in Alzheimer\u2019s patients with moderate to severe cognitive decline,\u201d wrote the researchers, who further suggest these negative effects worsen as the disease progresses.\n\nYears ago, researchers first observed the unusual presence of beta-amyloid plaques and tangles of tau proteins in the brains of patients with Alzheimer\u2019s. Scientists immediately recognized these factors as causing a dramatic loss of neurons and synapses that resulted in the characteristic memory loss and derangement of the illness. However, Azheimer\u2019s disease (AD) not only causes a decline in mental ability but also disturbs the sleep of sufferers. Today, scientists are looking more closely at the brain regions and networks involved in the sleep-wake rhythm. In particular, they are focusing on a neurotransmitter produced in the hypothalamus, which helps us stay awake: Orexin A, (also referred to as hypocretin 1), a leading actor in the orexinergic system. In fact, the lack of this neurotransmitter is what causes the most common form of narcolepsy.\n\nFor the current study, researchers measured cerebrospinal fluid orexin levels in drug-free Alzheimer\u2019s patients and compared them with healthy controls. The study ran from August 2012, through May 2013 and included 48 untreated Alzheimer\u2019s patients at the Neurological Clinic of the University Hospital of Rome Tor Vergata. After examination, the researchers divided the group into 21 patients with mild AD and 27 patients with moderate to severe AD. The control group consisted of nondemented participants of similar age and sex.\n\nThe researchers discovered patients with moderate to severe AD presented with higher than average orexin levels compared with controls and they had more impaired sleep compared with controls as well as the patients with mild AD. In the overall AD group, orexin levels were associated with total tau protein levels and sleep impairment. Cognitive impairment was associated with sleep deterioration.\n\n\u201cWith a rising prevalence of AD around the world, there is an urgent need to identify opportunities for prevention and treatment of the disease,\u201d noted Dr. Luigi Ferini-Strambi, of the Universit\u00e1 Vita-Salute, Milan, in his related commentary. \"Further research should clarity how to modify or improve sleep for mitigating the risk of future AD or for slowing AD progression.\u201d\n\nSources: Liguori C, Romigi A, Nuccatelli M, et al.
