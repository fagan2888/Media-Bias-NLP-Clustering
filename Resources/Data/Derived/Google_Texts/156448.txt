Yes, those are “Back to the Future” stars Christopher Lloyd and Billy Zane. And, yes, that is an awesome, working DeLorean. Sadly, contrary to the tag line, “The Future Has Arrived,” the rest of this star-studded video featuring “Back to the Future”-like hoverboards is fake.

Despite that fact, the video by HOVr is well worth a watch. It stars Tony Hawk, Moby, Terrell Owens and actress Agnes Bruckner — who excitedly teeter around on the board, while sincerely lauding the fake hoverboard’s ease of use. Tony Hawk even says that “Back to the Future” was a huge reason skateboarding became popular.
