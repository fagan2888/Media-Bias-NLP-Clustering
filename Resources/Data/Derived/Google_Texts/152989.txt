What it asks: "May the state retain and spend state revenues that otherwise would be refunded for exceeding an estimate included in the ballot information booklet for Proposition AA and use these revenues to provide forty million dollars for public school building construction and for other needs, such as law enforcement, youth programs, and marijuana education and prevention programs, instead of refunding these revenues to retail marijuana cultivation facilities, retail marijuana purchasers, and other taxpayers?"

What it means: The ballot question asks voters if the state should be allowed to keep the $66 million in marijuana taxes collected during the first year of legal recreational pot in Colorado, or should that money be refunded to growers and users?

What supporters say: The refund would largely go to marijuana growers and users, and the average taxpayer would only get about $6 to $16 in refunds when it is divided up. But should the state keep it, proponents of the measure say the millions could go toward schools and youth services.

What opponents say: While there has been very little organized opposition, some have raised concerns that the Legislature is not required to spend the money as the ballot measure suggests and that some of the programs set to benefit from the tax have nothing to do with marijuana.
