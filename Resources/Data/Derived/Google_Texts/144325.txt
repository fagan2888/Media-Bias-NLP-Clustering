SAN ANTONIO - It's been nearly three months since the shooting death of 18-year-old Quinton Jones, a high school senior from Roosevelt High School.

The shooting happened in the 4800 block of Ray Bon drive on the Northeast Side.

Since then, church members from the area have been organizing a "Blessed the Block" event once a month, advising people how to curb violence in their neighborhood.

Marcus McIntyre from New Method Church believes the event helps keep city streets safe.

"A lot of times we wait for the violence to act. We already know it's been a violent area. We're not waiting for it to come back. We're just here now, we want a positive presence in this place," said McIntyre.

"We're letting the residents know that we're here for them and we just want to establish relationships. Relationship is the key to anything in life," said Pastor Toya Taylor from T.I. Taylor Ministries.

No arrests have been made in Jones' murder, who was shot multiple times.

Crime Stoppers will pay up to $5,000 for information leading to an arrest.

Anyone with information is asked to call Crime Stoppers at 210-224-STOP.
