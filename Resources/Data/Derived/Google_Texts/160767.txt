A few news reports, including this one from the New York Times, did reference Mueller's involvement in a campus ministry:

Kathleen Day, head of the United Christian ministry at Northern Arizona University, remembered how Ms. Mueller used her blog as a way to encourage her peers to get involved. She did not just write a blog post and leave it at that: She sent it to friends and family, asking them to forward it to others and to take action.

“It’s not that she’s so angelic,” Ms. Day said. “She saw things and did what she could, whatever she could, however she could.”

Most news accounts focused on Mueller's humanitarian "calling."

CNN reported:

Mueller made it her life's work to help others. She graduated from Northern Arizona University in 2009, and worked with humanitarian groups in northern India, Israel and Palestinian territories, a family spokeswoman said.

"She had a quiet, calming presence. She was a free spirit, always standing up for those who were suffering and wanting to be their voice. ... Kayla's calling was to help those who were suffering, whether in her home in Prescott, or on the other side of the world," her aunts, Lori Lyon and Terri Crippes, said Tuesday.

In general, media reports on Mueller's faith — if that aspect of her life was explored at all — could be described as vague.

"Her letter feels almost spiritual but not religious to me, no mention of Jesus," said one Godbeat pro who was frustrated in attempts to track down information on Mueller's religion.
