It could be a whole lot worse, she says.\n\n\"I am around so many teen moms every day and, seriously, I am so lucky. I see how moms struggle when the dad is not there. It's heartbreaking. I would say that out of 10 teen moms I know, two, or maybe one, have the father of their son with them. And of the ones who are with the father, I feel like they aren't usually happy because the father isn't fully there.\"\n\nBlake Wilk, 21, plays with his baby son, Mason, while enjoying an ice cream cone with his daughter, Makenna, 2, at their home in Longmont on Thursday. (Jeremy Papasso / Staff Photographer)\n\nEdwin Olguin, the father of the couple's toddler, Elijah, is there.\n\nHe was 17 when he found out Garcia was pregnant. Now 20, he's four years into the relationship and has graduated from Arapahoe Ridge High School in Boulder, which has a nursery program for teen parents like him and Garcia.\n\nThe couple lives with Elijah in a mobile home owned by Garcia's father, with Olguin working full-time at a restaurant in Golden and Garcia working toward a diploma and what she hopes will be a career in nursing.\n\nBefore he was a parent, Olguin would smoke pot, hang out with friends and \"drink every day,\" starting around age 13. These days, he looks forward to playing at the park with his son, or going for a family excursion to an ice cream parlor.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"You go on Facebook and you see the posts and the pictures and see that your friends are having fun, and sometimes it gets to you. You're like, 'Damn, I wish I could be there with them.' But you have your son,\" Olguin says. \"Yeah, going with your friends gives you good laughs, but with my son, he's my joy. He's my laughter. When I look at him and I see him run, I feel wonderful. And he can see he has both parents. That gives me joy. He's my drug. He's awesome.\"\n\nGarcia, seated on the couch next to Olguin, shakes her head in semi-disbelief.\n\n\"I found a unicorn,\" she says. \"When people ask me where the father is, I say, 'Oh, he's still with me.' They can't believe it.\"\n\n'People misjudge you'\n\nJody Scanlon, director of Boulder County's Genesis program \u2014 a center for teen parent families, about 70 percent of whom live in Longmont and are Latino \u2014 says that, at any given time, about a quarter of the dads she sees are involved beyond child support payments.\n\nThe numbers speak volumes, but some teen fathers who are helping raise their children say they've been widely mischaracterized as deadbeats, subject to stereotyping and constant judgment.\n\nBlake Wilk, who found out his then-16-year-old girlfriend, Jessie, was pregnant just weeks before he was set to begin college in Colorado Springs, is now 21 and living in Longmont with her and their two children, ages 2 and 2 months. He wakes around sunrise six days a week to work for a moving company, and he has oriented his life entirely around his family.\n\nBut Wilk still gets the stares.\n\n\"It sucks when people misjudge you,\" he says. \"You don't have to be 35 to understand how to give all your love to someone. You're showing that kid your full attention and undivided love all the time. I don't think it's really a hard concept to understand.\"\n\nTeen moms get stereotyped, too. (\"People think I'm a slut,\" Garcia says, \"that I have no respect for myself or my family.\" )\n\nEdwin Olguin pushes his 2-year-old son on his bicycle last week in Boulder.

(Jeremy Papasso / Staff Photographer)\n\nBut they also get a lot more help.\n\n\"In our culture, we are much better about paying attention and giving support to moms and babies, and dads of all ages can experience that feeling that they're sort of left out,\" Scanlon says. \"They're not going through a pregnancy; they're not breastfeeding. It's a little more difficult in general for fathers to feel that connection.\"\n\n'You gotta be tough'\n\nThe world of teen parenting, in particular, lags behind that slowly developing cultural shift, even though it's well known that the presence of a father or a second parent figure can be critical to a child's development. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that kids who don't grow up with two parents are at elevated risk for substance abuse, school dropout and incarceration.\n\nTalk to the teen dads who've stuck around and they'll say they're aware of the positive impact they can have on their kids' long-term health and societal outcomes. They'll also tell you it isn't that complicated.\n\n\"It's scary being a parent, and I don't think anybody is really ready for kids at any age,\" Wilk says. \"But when you first see your kid, at least for me, it's this crazy moment where you see it's a part of you. It's this love that you don't really experience anywhere else. You're worried for them and you're happy for them, and you're worried and happy for yourself.\n\n\"You gotta be tough, and you gotta be ready,\" he adds. \"People are stronger than what they think. I mean, I surprised the hell out of myself. I didn't think I could do this, and here I am, sitting in my own apartment, with two kids, working six days a week.\"\n\nWhen Wilk speaks of his former self, the character feels more like a ghost than someone who, as recently as 2012, was an average teen living in Westminster and preparing for college.\n\nHe doesn't see much of his friends these days and has no time for skateboarding, his greatest childhood passion. By 6:30 most nights, he's lounging in the family room and, by 8, he's in bed.\n\nThree years ago, he was preparing to major in business. He'd still like to go to college, but the odds are stacked high against him: Fewer than half of teen parents even finish high school, according to the National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy.\n\n\"It's difficult to know that if I only had my high school diploma, it would be easier for me to get a more decent job,\" says Erick Rojas, 19.\n\nRojas works 60-hour weeks as a farmhand for a $400 weekly wage that goes mostly to covering rent for the Frederick trailer he shares with his wife and their 2-year-old.\n\n\"I've even thought about getting a second job,\" he says. \"It wouldn't be that much time spent with my daughter, but at the same time I think it could be good because we wouldn't struggle as much.\"\n\nRojas says his love for his daughter, Yarentcy, outweighs all regrets, but he's still got plenty of them.\n\n\"There are times when I wish I could have completed school, or that I could take back the day that I had to quit to be able to take care of my child.\"\n\n'I think it's a bad decision'\n\nFrancisco Carbenas, of Longmont, used to have the same second thoughts.\n\n\"After everything I've gone through, I think it's a bad decision,\" says Carbenas, now 30, of becoming a father at 16. \"There were times when we didn't have money for Pampers or milk. We were not mature enough to handle the responsibility.\"\n\nThe kinds of questions teen parents must ask themselves \u2014 Finish school? Work for minimum wage? Spend the end of a paycheck on diapers or dinner? \u2014 are ones that officials from D.C. to Boulder agree should never have to be asked. The CDC has cited teen pregnancy as one of six winnable battles in the field of public health, and communities across the country are making strides to that end.\n\n\"We're trying to work ourselves out of a job,\" says Scanlon, of the Genesis program.\n\nIn Colorado, the statewide teen pregnancy rate dropped 50 percent between 1991 \u2014 when the U.S. teen birth rate peaked at 61.8 births per 1,000 teen females \u2014 and 2010, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nIt's dropped more since then, to about 25 per 1,000 teen females, HHS reports. The progress is evident in Boulder County's Genesis program's case load, which has dropped from 602 cases in 2010 to just 324 last year.\n\nWhile Scanlon and others attempt to eliminate the need for the services they provide, the young fathers who take their charge seriously say that, in spite of all the sacrifices, they've found parenting to be a rewarding and life-affirming experience that can bring out the best in them.\n\n\"We went to get our eyebrows done together,\" Garcia says, \"and Edwin left the room for a second, and the lady working there told me how lucky I am. That my boyfriend seemed so happy, that there aren't a lot of men out there like that.\"\n\nOlguin bristles \u2014 first at Garcia's open discussion of his eyebrow treatment, and then at the notion that he's done anything special.\n\n\"I would tell any teen dad that it's hard,\" he says, \"but at any age, you'll have ups, you'll have downs, and at the end of the day you have to think about your family. That's what I do.\"\n\nAlex Burness: burnessa@dailycamera.com or twitter.com/alex_burness", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-county-news/ci_28347732/stereotyped-deadbeats-boulder-county-teen-dads-find-joy", "sailthru.author": "By Alex Burness \n  Staff Writer", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:28347732:view"}, "startDate": "2015-06-20T14:00:00-0600", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "Edith Garcia, a high school junior with a 2-year-old son, considers herself fortunate.
