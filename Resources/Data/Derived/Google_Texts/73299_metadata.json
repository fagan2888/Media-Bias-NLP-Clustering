The chancellor, who was raised in Communist East Germany, where the government regularly spied on its citizens, publicly vented at being monitored when it was discovered last fall that her cellphone had most likely been tapped by the American intelligence agency.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe affair, brought to light when the former N.S.A. contractor Edward J. Snowden leaked agency documents, continues to rile particularly the political and media elite, which are stunned that the Americans who taught post-Nazi Germans the meaning of privacy and freedom of the individual are collecting private data on such a scale.\n\nPresident Obama has promised Ms. Merkel that her phone is no longer monitored. But a German newspaper revealed recently that the phone of her predecessor, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, apparently was monitored in 2002, when he opposed the Bush administration\u2019s plans to go to war in Iraq.\n\nFor all the fury in Germany, the French reaction to the N.S.A. efforts has been more equivocal, since it emerged that French intelligence was as assiduous in collecting communications and online data \u2014 a necessary tool in fighting terrorism acknowledged by many Western countries.\n\nIn Washington last week, Mr. Obama and Mr. Hollande suggested at a news conference that any French-American rancor on the subject had dissipated.\n\n\u201cFollowing the revelations that appeared due to Mr. Snowden,\u201d Mr. Hollande said, \u201cwe clarified things, President Obama and myself clarified things.\u201d\n\nNow, Mr. Hollande said, \u201cwe are making headway\u201d in cooperating in the fight on terrorism without compromising principles of protecting privacy. \u201cMutual trust has been restored,\u201d he said, based on respect for each country.\n\nIt is unlikely that Ms. Merkel, who has said she will visit Washington in coming months, would be so definite, because Germans are much more upset.\n\nBut in her podcast she also acknowledged the difficulties of preserving privacy and of forging a common European policy on data protection. Germany, which because of its Nazi and Communist pasts has strict data protection laws, wants unity, but \u201cwe don\u2019t want our data protection softened,\u201d Ms. Merkel said.\n\nNoting that companies like Google and Facebook base their European data operations in countries she did not name \u201cwhere data protection is weakest,\u201d Ms. Merkel added, \u201cThat is a situation which we also cannot countenance forever.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140216220651, "twitter": {"description": "After the revelations of U.S. spying, Chancellor Angela Merkel said she would raise the matter at a meeting with the French president this week.", "title": "Merkel Backs Plan to Keep European Data in Europe", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/17/world/europe/merkel-backs-plan-to-keep-european-data-in-europe.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002715077"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "creator": "asmalenyt", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/17/world/europe/merkel-backs-plan-to-keep-european-data-in-europe.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002715077", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/17/world/europe/merkel-backs-plan-to-keep-european-data-in-europe.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "world/europe", "hdl_p": "Merkel Backs Plan to Keep European Data in Europe", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/world/europe/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Feb. 16, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "org": "Deutsche Telekom AG", "keywords": "National Security Agency,Germany,France,Data Storage,Surveillance of Citizens by Government,Merkel  Angela,Hollande  Francois,Deutsche Telekom AG,Europe,United States,Espionage and Intelligence Services,Computer Security,E-Mail,Privacy", "news_keywords": "Germany,France,Europe,Email,Privacy", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Alison Smale", "SCG": "europe", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Hollande, Francois", "byl": "By ALISON SMALE", "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "After the revelations of U.S. spying, Chancellor Angela Merkel said she would raise the matter at a meeting with the French president this week.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "description": "After the revelations of U.S. spying, Chancellor Angela Merkel said she would raise the matter at a meeting with the French president this week.", "CG": "world", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Feb. 16, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/s/alison_smale/index.html", "section": "Europe", "modified": "2014-02-18", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/world/europe/index.jsonp", "tag": "Privacy", "published": "2014-02-16", "section-taxonomy-id": "9A43D8FC-F4CF-44D9-9B34-138D30468F8F"}, "geo": "United States", "slug": "17germany", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140218140633, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/17/world/europe/merkel-backs-plan-to-keep-european-data-in-europe.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article", "description": "After the revelations of U.S. spying, Chancellor Angela Merkel said she would raise the matter at a meeting with the French president this week.", "title": "Merkel Backs Plan to Keep European Data in Europe"}, "pdate": 20140216, "des": "Privacy", "articleid": 100000002715077, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Merkel Backs Plan to Keep European Data in Europe", "PST": "News"}, "article_summary": "Germany, which because of its Nazi and Communist pasts has strict data protection laws, wants unity, but \u201cwe don\u2019t want our data protection softened,\u201d Ms. Merkel said.\nNoting that companies like Google and Facebook base their European data operations in countries she did not name \u201cwhere data protection is weakest,\u201d Ms. Merkel added, \u201cThat is a situation which we also cannot countenance forever.\u201d\nIn Washington last week, Mr. Obama and Mr. Hollande suggested at a news conference that any French-American rancor on the subject had dissipated.\n\u201cWe will, above all, discuss which European providers we have who offer security for our citizens,\u201d Ms. Merkel said on Saturday in her weekly podcast.\nBut this was the first time that Ms. Merkel had publicly embraced the proposal."}
