John Cornyn\u2019s seat. Both are democrats.\n\nScherr says she is running to \u201cget Texas off Cruz control.\u201d\n\n\u201cCruz control works great for big corporations, but it doesn\u2019t work for middle class families, we\u2019re left to deal with the wreckage,\u201d Scherr said in her campaign announcement video.\n\nCruz is the very essence of what is wrong with Washington according to Scherr, as well as Cornyn.\n\n\u201cJohn Cornyn is stuck on Cruz control, and I won\u2019t be,\u201d Sherr said.\n\nShe is currently traveling around Texas in a recreational vehicle attached to a wrecked car in order to spread her message that Cruz has led to the destruction of the state.\n\nIf she is elected, Scherr said she will would work to raise the minimum wage to 10 dollars an hour, fix Obamacare to \u201cnot let insurance industry do whatever they want\u201d and increase support for Texas public schools. The single mother is also supportive of gay marriage and abortion.\n\nAlameel, who is from Dallas, is a former donor for Sen. Cornyn, but is now running against the long-serving lawmaker because he feel Cornyn\u2019s main focus is only to get reelected and not on the issues.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s part of the problem. He produced big deficits and big government and he has absolutely no solution other than giving tax breaks to the rich,\u201d Alameel said, according to the Dallas Morning News.\n\nAlameel said he will do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d, and that \u201cmoney is not an issue\u201d for him during his campaign. In 2011 Alameel ran to represent district 33 in the House of Representatives, but lost to Rep. Marc Veasey.\n\n\u201cSen. Cornyn welcomes them into the race and he looks forward to discussing his record with Texans, who deserve better than skyrocketing healthcare premiums and dropped coverage at the hands of Democrats\u2019 signature legislative failure,\u201d Brendan Steinhauser, Cornyn\u2019s campaign manager for the 2014 re-election, said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "An attorney and a dentist have filed to run against Sen.
