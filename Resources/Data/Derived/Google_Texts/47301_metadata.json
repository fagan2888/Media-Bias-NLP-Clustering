He ruled that the law is preempted by the federal Affordable Care Act.\n\nMissouri legislators passed the law, the Health Insurance Marketplace Innovation Act (HIMIA), in 2013 at the behest of insurance agents and brokers. The law prohibits navigators from counseling consumers about the benefits, terms and features of health plans offered on the exchanges, or marketplaces, established by the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare. It also bars them from providing information on health plans not offered on the exchanges.\n\nNavigators are individuals or organizations trained to help consumers understand their health coverage options under the ACA. More than a dozen states, including Missouri, passed laws restricting their activities. The laws were widely seen as an attempt to hobble implementation of the ACA, the signature domestic achievement of President Obama.\n\nAfter HIMIA\u2019s enactment, several organizations, including St. Louis Effort for AIDS and Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region and Southwest Missouri, sued to block its implementation. In January 2014, Smith found that the ACA preempted Missouri\u2019s law and issued a preliminary injunction in favor of the plaintiffs.\n\nThe Missouri Department of Insurance, which is responsible for enforcing HIMIA, appealed, and in April 2015 a federal appeals court upheld most of Smith\u2019s findings.\n\nOn Wednesday, Smith permanently blocked the insurance department from enforcing the \u201cno advice\u201d and \u201coff exchange\u201d provisions of the law. He also blocked it from enforcing another HIMIA provision that requires navigators to refer consumers with existing health insurance coverage to insurance brokers or agents \u201cregarding coverage in the private market.\u201d\n\nSmith noted that if the plaintiffs comply with HIMIA, they risk violating their obligations as navigators. On the other hand, if they perform their duties under the ACA, they risked violating HIMIA.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Missouri Department of Insurance did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAbigail Coursolle, an attorney for the National Health Law Program, which represented the plaintiffs, said Smith\u2019s decision was significant not just for Missouri but for states with similarly restrictive laws.\n\n\u201cWe really are hoping that this decision sends a message to those states that they can't put barriers in the way of letting people know about their options for affordable health care coverage,\u201d she said.\n\nMissouri was one of the first states to enact such a law, and Coursolle said her organization viewed it as a test case.\n\n\u201cSome of the states that passed laws have subsequently watered them down \u2013 there were new federal regulations that came out that made it clear that laws of this kind were not allowable,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I think this ruling really makes that very, very clear for other states and hopefully we'll see those laws going away.\u201d\n\nJay Angoff, a former Missouri insurance director who also represented the plaintiffs, said Missouri has one of the most restrictive navigator laws, which is why it was singled out for legal challenge.\n\n\u201cWe think it's a very significant decision beyond Missouri because there are about 15 states that have at least one of the three provisions that Judge Smith struck down in their law,\u201d Angoff said. \u201cThis decision obviously is not binding in those states, but we think that it would certainly be influential.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, Mary M. Kogut, President and CEO of Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region and Southwest Missouri, said her organization was \u201cvery pleased\u201d with the decision.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately,\u201d she said, \u201cmany of the Missourians our assisters met with this year fell into Missouri\u2019s Medicaid Gap and therefore remain uninsured. We urge the Missouri legislature to close the gap so that all Missourians have access to affordable health insurance.\u201d\n\nKogut was referring to consumers who make too much to qualify for Medicaid in Missouri but too little to qualify for subsidies in the Affordable Care marketplace. In Missouri, adults qualify for Medicaid if they make less than 18 percent of the federal poverty level, or about $3,600 a year. Marketplace subsidies are available only to those who make between 100 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty level.\n\nDan Margolies, editor of the Heartland Health Monitor team, is based at KCUR.
