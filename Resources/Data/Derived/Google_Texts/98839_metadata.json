Blue Shield said it is drawing on some of its $4 billion in reserves for the all-cash transaction.\n\nThe deal is still subject to numerous regulatory approvals, and it's expected to close in the third quarter of 2015.\n\nBlue Shield said it could continue to operate the businesses in Arizona and Texas under the Care 1st name. Markovich said no decisions have been made yet on how to proceed with those operations outside California.\n\nTwitter: @chadterhune", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Blue Shield moves into Medicaid with Care 1st deal", "date": "2014-12-08", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "Looking to seize on the massive expansion of Medicaid , Blue Shield of California said it has agreed to acquire Monterey Park health plan Care 1st for an undisclosed sum.", "title": "Blue Shield moves into Medicaid with Care 1st deal", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/business/healthcare/la-fi-blue-shield-deal-20141208-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-54860292/turbine/la-fi-blue-shield-deal-20141208", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp09.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "affordable care act, obamacare, medicaid, medi-cal, blue shield", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/82225945", "googlebot-news": "index", "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "news_keywords": "affordable care act, obamacare, medicaid, medi-cal, blue shield", "y_key": "cee2fe4077f8d050", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "Description": "Looking to seize on the massive expansion of Medicaid, Blue Shield of California said it has agreed to acquire Monterey Park health plan Care 1st for an undisclosed sum.
