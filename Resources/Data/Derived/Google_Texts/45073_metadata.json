She wasn't.\n\nThe Lynch nominated for attorney general never worked for the Clinton campaign. During the Clinton administration, Lynch served as the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York, Brooklyn's top federal prosecutor -- the same job she holds today.\n\nObama announced Lynch as his pick to head the Department of Justice on Saturday, saying of her, \"It\u2019s pretty hard to be more qualified for this job than Loretta.\" If confirmed by the Senate, Lynch would be the first black woman in the job and would follow the first black attorney general.\n\nBreitbart updated the Whitewater story along with another that also referred to the wrong Lynch, Talking Points Memo notes, before taking the Whitewater down late Sunday night.\n\nBut before the article was removed, it was given a correction notice, placed at the bottom. Here it is, in all its splendor:\n\nCorrection: The Loretta Lynch identified earlier as the Whitewater attorney was, in fact, a different attorney.\n\nh/t Media Matters\n\nCLARIFICATION: Language has been changed to reflect that the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York is, in fact, the top federal prosecutor in Brooklyn, and they are not as initially suggested two separate positions.\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Fox News FAILS Fox News FAILS\n\n1 of 13 A Common Misconception \"Up next, the tragic story of a cat who just wants a cheeseburger, but is denied by Obamacare.\" Via Reddit Share this slide:\n\n\n\nMore: Loretta Lynch", "article_metadata": {"description": "In a now-removed", "sailthru.expire_date": "2014-11-10 22:50:56 -0500", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "In a now-removed", "title": "Breitbart Completely Botches Attack On Obama's Attorney General Pick", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/09/breitbart-criticizes-wrong-loretta-lynch_n_6130372.html", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2260390/images/o-LORETTA-LYNCH-facebook.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In a now-removed", "creator": "peandhart", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2260390/images/o-LORETTA-LYNCH-facebook.jpg", "height": 1000}, "title": "Breitbart Completely Botches Attack On Obama's Attorney General Pick", "site": "@HuffPostMedia", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-11-09 22:50:56 -0500", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=6130372", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "media", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "Loretta Lynch,breitbart loretta lynch,wrong loretta lych,conservative breitbart loretta lynch,breitbart attorney general,breitbart wrong attorney general,breitbart obama attorney general loretta lynch,breitbart attacks loretta lynch,breitbart correction attorney general,breitbart correction loretta lynch", "article": {"section": "Media", "tag": "Loretta Lynch,breitbart loretta lynch,wrong loretta lych,conservative breitbart loretta lynch,breitbart attorney general,breitbart wrong attorney general,breitbart obama attorney general loretta lynch,breitbart attacks loretta lynch,breitbart correction attorney general,breitbart correction loretta lynch", "published_time": "2014-11-09 22:50:56 -0500", "modified_time": "2014-11-11 14:59:02 -0500"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb720\"", "article_summary": "In a now-removed article criticizing Loretta Lynch, President Barack Obama's nominee for attorney general, conservative news site Breitbart achieved two remarkable feats: it attacked the wrong Lynch, and issued one of the best correction notices of all time.\nHere it is, in all its splendor:Correction: The Loretta Lynch identified earlier as the Whitewater attorney was, in fact, a different attorney.\nBreitbart alleged that Loretta Lynch, the New York federal prosecutor Obama has nominated, was a part of the defense team for former President Bill Clinton during the 1992 Whitewater scandal.\nBreitbart updated the Whitewater story along with another that also referred to the wrong Lynch, Talking Points Memo notes, before taking the Whitewater down late Sunday night.\nVia Reddit Share this slide:More: Loretta Lynch"}
