Paige.\n\nWhen the former Rangeview High School star arrived at Colorado State in 2014, he went by Jeremiah. He couldn\u2019t wait to drape a green-and-gold jersey over his shoulders and play in his first college basketball game.\n\n\u201cRedshirting wasn\u2019t on my mind at all,\u201d he said.\n\nOne long year later, after a season in which he could only practice and not suit up for games, Paige entered the 2015-16 season eager for a new beginning in almost every way.\n\n\u201cMy dad actually gave me the name (J.D.) when I was younger, so a lot of family members called me that,\u201d said Paige, a 6-foot-3 guard. \u201cSo after I redshirted, I said, \u2018Why not a new start?\u2019 \u201c\n\nIt\u2019s easy in this age, with Kentucky\u2019s annual batch of fabulous freshmen making title runs and LSU\u2019s Ben Simmons drawing Le- Bron James comparisons, to think every college player should be ready to help a team from the moment he moves into his dorm room.\n\nThe reality is, outside of the prospects playing in the McDonald\u2019s All-American Game to end their prep careers, being thrown into the Division I fire isn\u2019t an easy proposition for most first-year players.\n\nA year to grow physically, to study and soak in the game, to plant roots into the college environment, are benefits that can come from taking a year away from in-game competition.\n\nOne example: Colorado has received great contributions this season from wing George King, who played as a freshman and then redshirted last year to continue working on his game.\n\nThe struggle for an 18- or 19-year-old who has played dozens of games per year though AAU and high school seasons \u2014 spring, summer, fall and winter \u2014 is viewing his situation through long-term lenses.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the hardest thing to do, to accept what happens and move on from it,\u201d Paige said of redshirting. \u201cAs soon as you accept it, you can move on from the situation and start to get better.\u201d\n\nPaige said missing games, not being on the court with his teammates during their 27-win season last year, was difficult. But it was not idle time. He said he built his body like he never had before, and now has noticed an improved ability to finish through contact at the rim.\n\nEntering CSU\u2019s game against Utah State on Saturday, Paige was averaging 5.6 points, 2.0 rebounds and 1.5 assists in 18.6 minutes per game. He had the biggest game of his career in the Rams\u2019 66-65 victory over UNLV on Jan. 6, scoring seven points in the game\u2019s final minute to help CSU pull off a huge Mountain West victory.\n\n\u201cIt was fun being able to be out there with my team after we all put the work in,\u201d Paige said. \u201cIt was great that I was able to contribute like that.\u201d\n\nPaige isn\u2019t the only member of this state\u2019s talented 2014 high school class to benefit from a year on the bench.\n\nGonzaga\u2019s Josh Perkins, a former Regis Jesuit standout, wasn\u2019t supposed to redshirt during his first year in Spokane, Wash. But a broken jaw a couple games into the season altered plans and he was forced to put on that metaphorical shirt he never intended to wear.\n\nBut Perkins got to travel with the team last season and watch star point guard Kevin Pangos up close as he led Gonzaga to the Elite Eight. Now, he has stepped into Pangos\u2019 role and is averaging 10.4 points for the Bulldogs.\n\n\u201cEverything happens for a reason,\u201d Perkins told The Seattle Times. \u201cHopefully, it\u2019s for the greater good.\u201d\n\nPaige wasn\u2019t forced to the sideline by injury, but he now sees the benefits of the time off the court.\n\n\u201cIt was about getting stronger and learning,\u201d he said. \u201cJust being a student of the game, learning from the older guys and growing.\u201d\n\nNick Kosmider: 303-954-1516, nkosmider @denverpost.com or @nickkosmider", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Kosmider: J.D.
