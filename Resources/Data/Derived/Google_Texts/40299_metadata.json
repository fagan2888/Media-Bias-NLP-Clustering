Women\u2019s health advocates say they welcome any expansion of fertility coverage.\n\nBut they say that the much-publicized changes at high-profile companies, including Facebook and Apple, are still relatively rare, even for women with cancer and other serious illnesses who want to preserve their fertility.\n\nNews stories about company-paid egg freezing for female employees have focused on whether the benefit truly gives women and men more options for balancing work and family life or instead sends a message that they\u2019re expected to put off having a family if they want to get ahead on the job.\n\nBut that is not the main concern for some women who, because of illness or age, are worried that time is running out for them to have children.\n\nAfter their mid-30s, women can still carry a pregnancy, but their eggs are less viable. Egg freezing allows women to extend their fertile years.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never met anyone who fits the mold of the stereotypical egg freezer who\u2019s career mad and waiting for Mr. Right,\u201d says Brigitte Adams, 42, who became the face of oocyte cryopreservation, as egg freezing is called, when Bloomberg BusinessWeek put her on its cover for a story on the subject last spring. \u201cA lot of women will tell you, \u2018I didn\u2019t expect to be here. I just want the possibility of having a child.\u2019 \u201d Adams is one of those women. Divorced in her mid-30s, she froze her eggs three years ago, paying for the $12,000 egg retrieval procedure with personal savings and help from her parents. Adams pays $300 annually to store her eggs, and she\u2019s pondering becoming a single mother.\n\nHer marketing job at a tech start-up in Los Angeles doesn\u2019t provide any coverage for egg freezing and storage or the in vitro fertilization that will be required if she decides to go ahead.\n\nAdams is keenly aware that there is no guarantee that the 11 eggs she\u2019s storing will result in a pregnancy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a silver bullet,\u201d Adams says, \u201cbut it gave me the sense I\u2019d done everything I could, and that has helped me tremendously to just move on.\u201d\n\nTwo years ago, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine declared that it no longer considered egg freezing to be experimental. Research shows that fertilization and pregnancy rates using frozen eggs are similar to those using fresh eggs, and children born using frozen eggs don\u2019t have higher levels of chromosomal abnormalities or birth defects, the ASRM said in its revised practice guideline.\n\nYet insurance coverage for egg freezing and other infertility treatments remains spotty, says Richard Reindollar, ASRM\u2019s executive director.\n\n\u201cOf all the disease processes, insurance coverage is available for essentially all of them, but not for infertility,\u201d he says.\n\nAmerica\u2019s Health Insurance Plans hasn\u2019t surveyed insurers specifically about egg freezing coverage, says Susan Pisano, a spokewoman for the trade group. However, she said, her understanding is that many plans cover egg freezing when there\u2019s a diagnosed fertility problem or when an individual is at risk for infertility because of such treatments as radiation therapy or chemotherapy.\n\nCoverage for non-medical reasons is much less common, Pisano says.\n\nRoughly a third of companies with 500 or more workers provide no coverage for infertility services, according to benefits consultant Mercer\u2019s annual survey of employer health benefits.\n\nHigh-tech companies are more likely to cover fertility services than other firms, according to Mercer. Forty-five percent of high-tech companies cover in vitro fertilization, and 27 percent cover other advanced reproductive procedures such as egg freezing, for example. The comparable figures for non-high-tech companies were 26 percent and 14 percent, respectively.\n\nIn January, Facebook began offering up to $20,000 in egg freezing coverage for medical or nonmedical reasons for its U.S. employees, a company representative confirmed.\n\n\u201cSilicon Valley is probably leading the way [in coverage for egg freezing] since competition is fierce and companies are always looking for ways to attract recruits,\u201d says Dan Bernstein, a senior consultant at Mercer\u2019s San Francisco office.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2014/12/20141121-AMX-EGG-FREEZING211-e1420561761734.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "article_summary": "America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans hasn\u2019t surveyed insurers specifically about egg freezing coverage, says Susan Pisano, a spokewoman for the trade group.\nIn January, Facebook began offering up to $20,000 in egg freezing coverage for medical or nonmedical reasons for its U.S. employees, a company representative confirmed.\nYet insurance coverage for egg freezing and other infertility treatments remains spotty, says Richard Reindollar, ASRM\u2019s executive director.\nForty-five percent of high-tech companies cover in vitro fertilization, and 27 percent cover other advanced reproductive procedures such as egg freezing, for example.\nAs some companies add egg freezing to their list of fertility benefits, they\u2019re touting the coverage as a family-friendly perk."}
