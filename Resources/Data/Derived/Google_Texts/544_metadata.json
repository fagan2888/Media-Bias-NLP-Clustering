No longer.\n\nFrom Jan. 1990 to July, Michigan gained private-sector jobs more quickly than Ohio. Private-sector employment increased at a rate of 12.4 percent in Michigan and 11.9 percent in Ohio.\n\nMichigan\u2019s long-term job creation rate has leapfrogged Ohio, which has had middling job growth since the 2007-09 recession and miserable job growth through the first seven months of 2015.\n\nSince December, Ohio has gained only 9,500 private-sector jobs while Michigan has gained 66,900.\n\nFree-market think tanks The Buckeye Institute and Opportunity Ohio both noted Ohio\u2019s slide behind its rival to the north in monthly reports tracking the latest U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data.\n\nRELATED: Who\u2019s paying for Medicaid expansion?\n\nOpportunity Ohio president Matt Mayer said compulsory union dues in Ohio are a serious hindrance to the state\u2019s economic growth.\n\nOhio is one of 25 states where workers can be forced to pay a labor union to have a job. Michigan\u2019s right-to-work law ending mandatory union dues took effect in 2013.\n\n\u201cAs Ohio added a paltry 9,500 private sector jobs in 2015, just across the border, Michigan added seven times as many, creating a prosperous future for nearly 67,000 Michigan families,\u201d Mayer said in an email to Ohio Watchdog.\n\nMichigan adopted right-to-work after Indiana \u2013 Ohio\u2019s neighbor to the west \u2013 enacted its own right-to-work law in early 2012. Ohio Gov. John Kasich says Ohio has no need for right-to-work.\n\nNet job growth this year is almost four times greater in Indiana than Ohio, Mayer said, adding, \u201cJohn Kasich can keep denying the importance of right-to-work, but his denial only denies tens of thousands of Ohioans a brighter future.\u201d\n\nMichigan and Indiana have markedly outperformed Ohio\u2019s private-sector job growth since Kasich took office in Jan. 2011.\n\nSince December, Ohio\u2019s private-sector job growth rate is 0.2 percent, Indiana\u2019s is 1.5 percent, and Michigan\u2019s is 1.8 percent. Michigan and Indiana are both on track to create more jobs than Ohio does this year, despite having far fewer residents.\n\nMayer pointed to an Opportunity Ohio white paper showing 12 of the 13 U.S. states with the worst private-sector job creation don\u2019t have right-to-work. The only right-to-work state in the bottom 13 is Michigan, whose economy has improved rapidly since 2013.\n\nBuckeye Institute policy analyst Greg Lawson agreed that right-to-work is the most obvious reform giving long-suffering Michigan a new advantage over Ohio.\n\n\u201cIt is not surprising Michigan finally eclipsed Ohio in private sector job growth,\u201d Lawson told Ohio Watchdog. \u201cMichigan, of course, finally joined the ranks of right-to-work states, while Ohio lags behind by not embracing that reform.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would not be surprised if Michigan\u2019s private sector growth rate continues to beat Ohio\u2019s for some time,\u201d Lawson continued, pointing out Michigan was the only state to lose more private-sector jobs than Ohio did between 2000 and 2010.\n\nKasich\u2019s office did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nPrivate-sector employment in Ohio was 4.62 million in July, far short of a 4.85 million March 2000 peak. Ohio has barely recovered from the 2007-09 recession, and could take years longer to recover from the 2000-01 recession.\n\nIn some sectors, Ohio\u2019s economy has been on a downward slide for decades. Employment in the construction, manufacturing and information sectors was lower in July than in January 1990, according to Buckeye\u2019s Ohio by the Numbers report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ohio's ability to outperform Michigan's long-term job growth has been a silver lining around a cloudy Ohio economic recovery for years.
