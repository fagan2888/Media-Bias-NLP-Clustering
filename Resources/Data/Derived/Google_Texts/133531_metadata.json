In fact, implementing Obamacare is a major fiscal and economic boost to any state that does it, and states opting out of the Medicaid expansion are going to have significantly lower overall incomes and fewer jobs than if they had gone along. (My back of the envelope says around 1 percent of GDP, but I\u2019m still working on that.)\n\nBeyond that, however, the California as fiscal basket case narrative is way, way out of date. Jerry Brown and the huge Democratic majority in the legislature have turned that situation completely around.\n\nI know, it\u2019s not supposed to be that way \u2014 and a lot of people will stick to their narrative, never mind the facts. But anyway, California is doing OK, both on health care and on budget policy.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20131126102836, "BN": "krugman", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/krugman", "DISPLAYDATE": "November 26, 2013", "keywords": "Uncategorized", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/krugman/California Myths ( 20131126 )", "PT": "Blogs", "SCG": "krugman", "sourceApp": "blogs", "twitter": {"description": "Gotta keep up, people.", "title": "California Myths", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/26/california-myths/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "site": "@NytimesKrugman", "card": "summary"}, "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/krugman/post", "description": "Gotta keep up, people.", "CG": "Opinion", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "November 26, 2013", "article": {"published_time": 1385479716, "author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/paulkrugman/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Uncategorized", "modified_time": "2013-11-26T15:28:36-05:00"}, "utime": 20131126152836, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20131126, "pdate": 20131126, "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "Paul Krugman Blog", "description": "Gotta keep up, people.", "title": "California Myths", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/26/california-myths/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/26/california-myths/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "California Myths", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "article_summary": "Beyond that, however, the California as fiscal basket case narrative is way, way out of date.\nFirst of all, the Obamacare subsidies \u2014 both the credits for insurance purchased on the exchanges and the Medicaid expansion \u2014 are paid for by the federal government.\nI know, it\u2019s not supposed to be that way \u2014 and a lot of people will stick to their narrative, never mind the facts.\nAmong the many vituperative reactions I had to yesterday\u2019s column, one recurred a lot \u2014 namely, the assertion that California\u2019s rising enrollment in Obamacare would bankrupt the state, which is already a fiscal basket case.\nBut anyway, California is doing OK, both on health care and on budget policy."}
