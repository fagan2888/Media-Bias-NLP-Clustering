Delta activist offers ideas on real reason for Delta dams

• Karen Cunningham says its part of governors plan for giant tunnels • Temporary barrier looking mighty permanent • WITH VIDEO

by Gene Beley, Delta CorrespondentCLARKSBURGJune 7, 2015 9:03pmIf someone from the state government asked a Delta resident or business owner for the time of day, the Delta person might check to see if they still had a watch.

Distrust of the state government is seen in a recent statewide poll by the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute that showed just 61 percent of adults say they trust the government in Sacramento to do what is right only some of the time.

And it would seem that distrust runs deep in the California Delta as expressed by Karen Cunningham, a landowner on Bradford Island.

She says she thinks the installation of the West False River salt water barrier is just part of a big plan to support the governors controversial twin tunnels project.

In remarks delivered to the Clarksburg-based North Delta Community Area Residents for Environmental Stability (also known as North Delta CARES) she said that two Department of Water Resources representatives first contacted her and her husband, Smith Cunningham, in 2005 and wanted access to their property.

Karen Cunningham tells how the history of West False River barrier dam dates back to before 2005—and is all part of "The PLAN" from Gene Beley on Vimeo.

When the Cunninghams asked, Whats going on? they were told that DWR wanted to put a gate from their island to Jersey Island.

They didnt call it an emergency drought barrier, Mrs. Cunningham told the North Delta CARES audience. They called it a gate.

Then she showed the audience the original document that DWR representatives gave them back in 2005. They were told the other gate was going in Three Mile Slough.

At first they called it the Franks Tract Project. Then somewhere in 2008 or 2009 the temporary entry permits I was receiving had a new name on it called BDCP. These fellows at that time called them pipes. They didnt call them tunnels or a canal. They told us big pipes were going to come down from somewhere up north on the west side of the Delta and they were going under Bradford Island, then straight do the pumps.

You can see that route if you go out there by looking at the transmission lines of PG&E and eyeballing it. If you go down to Orwood and Discovery bay you can see that coming across Twitchell Island and all the islands the state already owns. So the West False River barrier is not for the emergency drought, she said.

The state has said the massive rock wall will block saltier water from getting deeper into the Delta during the drought when insufficient fresh water flows fail to force back the salt water.

In 2009 we had gone to all the public and private meetings with land owners, Mrs. Cunningham continued. We were told the Three Mile Slough barrier is a definite go but youre off the hook for now. But it is guaranteed that we will be back.

And here they are  they figured the drought was a good opportunity to slam in the West False River barrier and get the permanent part in with the two metal abutments on each side of the rock barrier. The barrier is 750 wide and 150 of that on each side is the permanent abutment. Its in the exact spot they talked about in 2008.

Mrs. Cunningham said she asked back then, Why do you need these gates? Why does there need to be a gate in Three Mile Slough and a gate in False River?

Because these big pipes are going in and they will take so much fresh water that the salt will come up, she said the DWR representatives told the them. These gates have to be in place first.

So these gates are not a gate? asked Phyllis Dutra, a North Delta CARES member in the audience.

When they pull this barrier out, within a couple of years, it will morph into a permanent gate, said Mrs. Cunningham.

That is the permanent part, added Anna Swenson, a North Delta CARES advocate who had just visited the barrier earlier the same day. This is what they will hang the gate on.

But werent these supposed to be just three times in 10 years? asked Clarksburg resident Mary McTaggart, referring to a one time DWR proposal.

No, no  at our reclamation meeting the engineers said, Were not going to do that 10 year thing anymore. Theyve got this part in so why do they have to keep pulling it out and putting it back in?

The cost of putting in the barrier and them clawing it out adds up -- about $40 million with $10 million to just take out the rocks and store them in Rio Vista.

This was a huge water right in the Delta, continued Mrs. Cunningham, with the 150 taken from both sides. It is the biggest barrier ever put in the Delta. It is a major, major waterway for boaters. Why wouldnt they put boat passage in?

What will be the benefit of the Three Mile Slough gate then? asked Mrs. McTaggart.

It is a diversion, said Mrs. Cunningham, adding, It will only be effective with the West False River gate with two gates. The DWR representatives told us when they get the pipes in and suck out the fresh water, it (the two barriers) will stop the salt intrusion.

I went to the Bradford Reclamation District meeting when the state was purchasing the easement from the district on the Bradford Island side, said Mrs. Swenson. At that point Jacob L. McQuirk, an engineer for DWR, made the assertion that he had spoken to the farmers of the North Delta and gotten verbal permission to have easements on any property that they needed to put in the barriers.

I told them that was not true. He cited one farmer he had met with was a Mr. Wilson. So I called Mark Wilson and asked him if he had met with DWR and we figured out Mr. McQuirk had met with Daniel Wilson. That afternoon was the first contact Mr. McQuirk had ever made with the North Delta farmers about the barrier.

Mr. McQuirk added, I guess weve got to ID who the landowners are, then pressured the Bradford Reclamation district into doing this easement right, making them think the North Delta had already signed on. But that wasnt true.

Mrs. Swenson said the DWR negotiator Mr. McQuirk walked into the meeting thinking that the land was owned by a landowner who had signed a use permit in 2009 but it expired in 2011. That guy no longer even owned the land anymore, she said.

They were using an old Temporary Entry Permit that this guy signed, Mrs. Cunningham said. There were a few who signed it for about $500 for permission to get on their land to survey it.

The DWR started the bizarre negotiation on the encroachment for $1,600, said Mrs. Swenson. The reclamation district said we want our own evaluation of how much for the easement. Then the DWR said the state would offer $5,000 to go get their own easement and told them to take five grand plus $1,600 and its a deal right now. The reclamation district felt they didnt have a choice. It was an agreement with their arms tied behind their back.

I think thats exactly right, added Rogene Reynolds, a South Delta advocate in the audience.

Then why did the reclamation district sign any document to give DWR the needed right of way encroachment?

Its not that there wasnt a choice, Cate Kuhne, president of Bradford Island Reclamation District #2059, said by phone from her home on June 6. When youre looking at a situation like the barrier, after the governor made the emergency proclamation, is the District going to fight the proclamation?

It was a matter of dealing with the encroachment and the state wanted a natural easement, continued Mrs. Kuhne. We required them to purchase an easement.

More history of The Plan from Mrs. Kuhne

There were three scenarios proposed, she continued.

According to Mrs. Kuhne:

 They wanted to put in gates in West False River and Three Mile Slough but that was put on hold in 2007.

 Their report came out with fully closed barriers on the first one.

 The second one would be 20 percent closed on both sides.

 The third alternative would be a tide-operated barrier closed 12 hours a day but would still allow boats to go through.

 With the 20 percent barrier, the velocity was so much it wasnt safe for boats. With the fully closed barrier, the velocity increased 10 times.

Then the DWR focused on two other projects that were named the Two Gates Model near Discovery Bay that got scrapped. The Army Corps of Engineers also had a project using Little Franks Tract that got put back on the table and last June the Delta Stewardship Council began to rework it.

The West False River barrier is using funds that were originally allocated for the original Franks Tract Project, said Mrs. Kuhne. Now the state is in a bad position.

She said the state is currently out of compliance on their original agreement and cited the negative impact on the Victoria II ferryboat that serves the Bradford Island to Jersey Island areas. The non-cable ferryboat has had great difficulty navigating their normal route between the islands since the barrier was installed, she said.

On the DWRs website, heres what it says about Franks Tract Project:

The California Department of Water Resources (DWR) and U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) propose to implement the Franks Tract Project to improve water quality and fisheries conditions in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta (Delta). DWR and Reclamation are evaluating installing operable gates to control the flow of water at key locations (Three mile Slough and/or West False River) to reduce seawater intrusion, and to positively influence movement of fish species of concern to areas that provide favorable habitat conditions. By protecting fish resources, this project also would improve operational reliability of the State Water Project (SWP) and Central Valley Project (CVP) because curtailments in water exports (pumping restrictions) are likely to be less frequent.

The project gates would be operated seasonally and during certain hours of the day, depending on fisheries and tidal conditions. Boat passage facilities would be included to allow for passing of watercraft when the gates are in operation. The Franks Tract Project is consistent with ongoing planning efforts for the Delta to help balance competing uses and create a more sustainable system for the future. Preparation of a joint environmental impact report/environmental impact statement (EIR/EIS) for the project is underway, and public input is strongly encouraged.
