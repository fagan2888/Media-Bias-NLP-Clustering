However, one thing that stands between us and drinking the best cup of coffee is the color of our mug. According to a recent study published in the journal Flavour, the color of our mug can affect the way we perceive the taste of our coffee.\n\nThe color and design of a product can affect consumers\u2019 perceptions. Louis Cheskin, psychologist and marketer, increased margarine sales in the 1940s when he suggested it be colored yellow to more closely resemble butter. Now, researchers from the Federation University Australia, believe caf\u00e9 owners, baristas, and kitchenware manufacturers can increase their coffee sales and get more returning customers by considering the color of their mugs.\n\nGeorge Van Doorn, author of the study and lecturer in psychology at Federation University Australia, was influenced to conduct a series of two experiments after a barista once told him that when coffee is consumed from a white, ceramic mug, it tastes bitterer than when consumed in a clear, glass mug, according to The Conversation. In Australia, these two mugs types are among the most commonly used vessels to serve coffee in Australian cafes and restaurants.\n\nTo put this observation to the test, Van Doorn sought to investigate whether consumers\u2019 perception of a caf\u00e9 latte beverage would be influenced by the color \u2014 transparent, white, or blue \u2014 of the mug from which it was consumed by conducting two experiments. In experiment one, the research team put the validity of the barista\u2019s claim to the test to measure the intensity of the coffee flavor in the transparent, white, or blue mug. The goal was to observe the perceived variations in coffee flavor without telling the 18 volunteers that they were, in actuality, drinking down the same stuff. The white mug enhanced the rated intensity of the coffee flavor relative to the transparent mug.\n\nThe three different coffee mugs used in Van Doorn's two experiments. Flavour\n\nIn experiment two, Van Doorn recruited 36 volunteers, but this time, the shape of the mugs were identical. The results were similar to the first experiment. The mug type exerted a significant influence on participants\u2019 ratings of the perceived sweetness of the caf\u00e9 latte. Coffee in a white mug was found to taste less sweet when compared to the other colored mugs. The blue cup made the coffee taste the sweetest.\n\n\u201cOur study clearly shows that the color of a mug does influence the perceived taste and flavor of coffee,\u201d Doorn wrote in the The Conversation. He added: \u201cThe effect of the color of the mug on the flavor of the coffee reported here suggests that caf\u00e9 owners, baristas, as well as crockery manufacturers should carefully consider the color of their mugs. The potential effects may spell the difference between a one-time purchase and a return customer.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time a study explores how our perception of food is contingent on the characteristics of the container from which we eat and drink. A 2013 study published in the Journal of Sensory Studies found hot chocolate tastes best from orange or cream colored mugs. However, the sweetness and the aroma of the beverage was not influenced by the color of the cup, despite participants mentioning that the chocolate was slightly sweeter and more aromatic in a cream colored cup.\n\nTaste can be influenced by a variety of factors from the color and cutlery to emotion and price. Remember, next time a barista asks you how you\u2019ll take your coffee, don\u2019t forget to say in a blue mug, please.\n\nSources: Spence C, Van Doorn GH, Wuillemin D.
