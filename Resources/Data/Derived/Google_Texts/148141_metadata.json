The Department of Health and Human Services has said customers shouldn\u2019t be concerned by the proposed hikes, because the actual increases have not been as high as first expected in recent years.\n\nIncreasing costs of medical services and prescription drugs are expected to grow more quickly than in recent years, though they remain low compared to historic levels, the report says.\n\nThe end of the reinsurance program this year will also be something insurers consider, the actuaries say. \u201cBy offsetting a portion of claims, the reinsurance program lowered premiums, and each year the gradual reduction in reinsurance funding resulted in a corresponding increase in premiums,\u201d the report reads. \u201cThe final impact of the program on premiums will occur in 2017, when projected claims are expected to increase by 4 to 7 percent due to the reinsurance program ending in 2016.\u201d\n\nChanges to risk pool composition, insurers assumptions, the delay of the implementation of the Health Insurers Tax and the repeal of the small group exchange will also have an effect on changes in premium requests, the report says. Market competition, changes in insurers\u2019 provider networks, benefit package changes and administrative factors can also affect premium rates, it adds.\n\nConsumers\u2019 premiums are also affected by increases in age, whether they\u2019ve moved, their family status and how their chosen plan is designed.\n\nAs the Affordable Care Act has been implemented, insurers relearning more about the market, which affects their actions, the report says.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/icons/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "Morning Consult", "description": "Underlying growth in health care costs and the\u00a0sunset of\u00a0the Affordable Care Act\u2019s reinsurance program are the major drivers behind insurance premium increases this year, according to a new\u00a0report from the American Academy of Actuaries.
