Humana (HUM) said Monday that it’s selling its urgent care and physical therapy services division for $1.055 billion to a private equity firm and a specialty-hospital and rehab-center operator. The health insurer will sell its Concentra unit to Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe and Select Medical Holdings (SEM) for $1.055 billion in cash and would use the proceeds from the sale to fund its current $2 billion share buyback program.

Humana shares dipped 0.3% to 182.32 on the stock market today near noon.

The health insurer bought Concentra in 2010 for $790 million before Bruce Broussard was appointed CEO in 2013.

“Concentra’s operations did not ultimately align with Humana’s strategy as well as we had originally anticipated,” Broussard said in the earnings release.

But, he added, “We expect Humana will continue to invest in other primary care assets” as it expands its integrated care delivery model.

Humana reiterated its 2015 EPS outlook of $8.50 to $9. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters are expecting $8.88.

Profit this year is expected to fall slightly on the sale, which is seen closing in the second quarter.

Shares of Select Medical, which will own 50.1%, rose 4.5% to 15.29 intraday, rising to their best levels since early August.

Welsh Carson was busy Monday.

Also Monday, Tenet Healthcare (THC) announced that it will buy United Surgical Partners International from Welsh Carson and other investors. Tenet will take a 50.1% stake now, with a path to full ownership over five years. Tenet also will buy Aspen Healthcare from Welsh Carson. Aspen which operates nine private hospitals and clinics in the U.K.

Shares jumped 5.4% to 52.31, rising above its 200-day line.
