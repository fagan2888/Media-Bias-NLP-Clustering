Not only are patients and staff threatened by the event, but new patient volumes typically swell during a catastrophe. Aside from hurricanes, tornadoes and earthquakes, man-made disasters like a terrorist attack or hacking incidents can also shut down hospital operations, temporarily or entirely.\n\nThese risks seem to have enlarged in recent years. Consequently, many hospitals have upgraded their business continuity planning. Such is the case at Susquehanna Health, a four-hospital integrated health system based in Williamsport, Pa. In upgrading its emergency preparedness plans, the health system took an enterprise risk management approach to disaster planning. \u201cWe evaluated the threat on a risk by risk basis,\u201d explained Charles Santangelo, Susquehanna Health\u2019s chief financial officer.\n\nRisk analysis in action\n\nSusquehanna Health began by identifying what were considered to be the key risks to its operations, equipment, staff, patients and technology systems. \u201cThen we assessed and prioritized these risks for resource allocation purposes, based on an enterprise risk management formula developed by Kaiser Permanente that we altered a bit to stress the likelihood of the event occurring,\u201d said James W. Slotterback, Susquehanna Health emergency preparedness coordinator. \u201cFor each risk, we plug in a number from zero to three to describe the potential risk likelihood and severity.\u201d\n\nAs the lead person on the health system\u2019s multi-functional emergency response planning group, Slotterback is the de facto head of the four hospitals\u2019 24/7 incidence response efforts. These measures include regular drills in which a particular type of disaster is imagined as the real thing. Slotterback defines a disaster as \u201canything that taxes our resources or affects our ability to deliver uninterrupted services.\u201d This could be a bus accident involving 30 injured people or it could be a hurricane.\n\n\u201cWe have pre-defined plans and a reporting structure already in place that address different types of disasters, and have designated proper procedures that are kicked into gear on the fly during the drill,\u201d he said.\n\n[See also: Reforecast: Can clinical analytics generate financial returns?.]\n\nSo far, Susquehanna Health has evaded a major disaster, but events around the country and the world nonetheless have persuaded a more penetrating analysis of its business continuity plans. Following several shootings at schools, public buildings and corporate worksites, the company conducted an active shooting drill with the local police and fire departments. \u201cEven though a study by Johns Hopkins in 2012 indicates that hospital shootings are extremely rare, less than the chance of getting struck by lightning, we wanted to upgrade our response just in case,\u201d CFO Santangelo said.\n\nMore alarming is the possibility of a bombing along the lines of that which occurred at the 2013 Boston Marathon. The city of Williamsport, a 45-minute drive from two of Susquehanna Health\u2019s four hospitals, hosts the annual Little League World Series. Over a three-week period, more than 30,000 people from outside the region flock to this city of about 120,000 individuals to participate and watch the games. The threat of a major disaster involving the event popped up on the system\u2019s enterprise risk management matrix.\n\nLike many healthcare institutions, Susquehanna Health\u2019s emergency preparedness plans are governed by regulations mandated by OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration), the US Department of Health and FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency). To receive federal subsidies set aside for national emergency preparedness, the health system undertakes a hazard vulnerability analysis identifying key threats to its operations, property and patients. This process reveals areas needing resources for continuous improvement or potential risks that require greater evaluation\u2014 such as the situation with the Little League World Series.\n\n[See also: Reforecast: Organizational culture key to successful hospital mergers.]\n\n\u201cWe conduct the analysis with our external partners at FEMA and the Health Department, as well as with local fire, police and other agencies,\u201d Slotterback said. \u201cTogether we look at what could possibly happen in our area, especially the biggest threats, and then we reflect these possibilities in our continuity planning.\u201d\n\nLeveraging a federal grant administered by the Pennsylvania State Department of Health, Susquehanna Health is conducting an emergency preparedness drill focused on the risks associated with the Little League World Series. They are partnering with organizations like FEMA, the state\u2019s health department and the FBO, among others. \u201cWe are using the exact patient mix that had occurred in the Boston bombing, and will conduct a full-scale exercise with actual live people this June,\u201d Slotterback said. \u201cOur biggest concern is that unlike Boston, which had eight trauma centers within three miles of the bomb site, our closest hospital is 45 minutes by ground transport outside Williamsport.\u201d\n\nHe believes such drills will become more important to all healthcare institutions in future. \u201cA large scale disaster guarantees a huge number of patients,\u201d Slotterback says. \u201cOur goal is to have plans in place to react to this possibility, hoping, of course, that we never have to.\u201d\n\nThis is the first article in a two-part series.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/when-disaster-strikes-risk-management-and-business-continuity", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/modules/open_graph/hfn-stacked.jpeg", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Hospitals confront extraordinary challenges in the aftermath of a natural disaster.
