PHOTO COURTESY OF LIFESTYLE & ENTERTAINMENT\n\nThis tiny house can be moved anywhere, which is part of the allure, according to its owner, Paul Haskins of River Falls, WI. They could be easily moved in or out of the yard of a caregiver. WEST CENTRAL TRIBUNE/Gary Miller\n\nTiny houses have become all the rage around the country as people gravitate towards the downsized, simpler life. Beth Ann Norgaard, a Brainerd native, packed up her things and moved from a larger home to this tiny house. The houses are inexpensive and can be custom designed to fit an individual\u2019s needs. WEST CENTRAL TRIBUNE/Gary Miller\n\nThe tiny house to the right right was built by Willmar, Minn. students to be used by a homeless advocacy group. WEST CENTRAL TRIBUNE/Gary Miller\n\nThis tiny house below was built by Luke and Charlene Sabin and sits in the driveway of their rental home in north Fargo. FORUM NEWS SERVICE/Michael Vosburg\n\nCould these trendy little abodes be a good alternative for those needing an assisted living facility?\n\nCould these trendy little abodes be a good alternative for those needing an assisted living facility?\n\nMinnesota lawmakers are considering legislation to allow small houses for disabled family members to be temporarily placed next to existing homes.\n\nRep. Roz Peterson, R-Lakeville, wants allow a temporary dwelling for a family member near a property owner\u2019s primary home. Its use would be recommended after a doctor\u2019s written certification of either mental illness or physical disability.\n\n\u201cSometimes people have an elderly relative who is either injured or needs to be in temporary hospice that wants to come home, but there is either not enough room or the house isn\u2019t accessible anymore,\u201d Peterson said. \u201cThis provides an option to take care of those loved ones at home.\u201d\n\nOnly one temporary dwelling would be permitted per property, under the guidance of a caregiver older than 18 who is either a relative, legal guardian or health care agent. A permit would allow the dwelling to be established for a six-month period and could be extended for up to a year.\n\nApproved by the House Aging and Long-Term Care Policy Committee, the bill now moves to the House Government Operations and Elections Policy Committee.\n\nNorth Carolina, Virginia and New York have similar laws.\n\nTemporary dwellings visually resemble a recreational vehicle or large trailer home. However, the qualifications in which they are built are like a home.\n\nNo larger than 300 square feet, each dwelling has its own electrical outlet and a self-enclosed septic tank accompanied by an insulated water intake that can be connected to the primary house on a property. They are constructed of exterior materials comparable in appearance and durability to materials used in residential construction. On the inside a full kitchen, bathroom and bedroom nook are designed to comply with American Disabilities Act requirements. Heating and air conditioning are available.\n\nAccording to NextDoor Housing, which specializes in the creation of temporary dwellings, one can be rented for about $1,500 a month, or bought for around $55,000 depending on amenities. A nursing home can cost more than $62,000 per year on average in Minnesota.\n\n\u201cThis is about creating opportunity and accessibility for those in need,\u201d said John Louiselle, founder of NextDoor Housing.\n\nAnita Burke of Apple Valley says the appeal to temporary dwellings stems from the desire to still take care of loved ones, but being logistically unable to do so.\n\n\u201cMy mother lives in assisted living with a rent of over $3,000 a month,\u201d she said. \u201cGiven her pension and Social Security benefits, she is quickly running out of funds. Over the last couple of years I have tried to find more affordable housing for her.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I could move my mother into my home I would,\u201d Burke added. \u201cI am willing and able. However, I do not have a handicap-accessible bathroom. We simply do not have room or enough money for an addition.\u201d\n\nWhile committee discussion was favorable about the bill\u2019s intent, concern was expressed over bill specifics that would need to be ironed out along its journey.\n\n\u201cCities are specifically tasked with dealing with issues of public safety, health and welfare of our residents,\u201d said Craig Johnson, intergovernmental relations representative with League of Minnesota Cities. \u201cOur task is to balance the needs, interests and rights with the various property owners in that jurisdiction.\u201d\n\nOne concern came over the power of local governments to control the use and location of temporary dwellings, including utility management and renewals.\n\nBurke tried to petition the Apple Valley City Council to allow a temporary dwelling on her lot, but was told it would not be possible.\n\n\u201cThis could really put a city council in a bind if, for whatever reason, they did not want to extend a renewal and are now in a position of evicting grandma,\u201d Rep. Barb Yarusso, D-Shoreview, said.\n\nAs written, a city would be mandated to allow the temporary dwelling upon a doctor\u2019s certification.\n\nAccording to Peterson, an argument against the use of traditional city council channels is the need for an expedited timeline due to strenuous and often unforeseen circumstances.\n\n\u201cThis is an opportunity to really streamline the process and make it easy for family members who are going through a very difficult time,\u201d Peterson said. \u201cThis is really lifting a barrier so that people can use their own property how they would like to.\u201d\n\nSafety was another concern.\n\nSince temporary dwellings are not secured to a permanent foundation, extreme weather such as a tornado could pose a safety threat.\n\nOther concerns raised were potential neighbor complaints, property taxes and neighborhood aesthetics.\n\nSession Daily (www.house.leg.state.mn.us/sessiondaily) is produced by the nonpartisan House Public Information Services.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Life,Tiny houses", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Nick Longworth", "og": {"site_name": "Detroit Lakes Online", "description": "Minnesota lawmakers are considering legislation to allow small houses for disabled family members to be temporarily placed next to existing homes.
