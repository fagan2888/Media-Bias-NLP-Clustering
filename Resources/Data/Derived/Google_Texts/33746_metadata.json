The flight, which had at least 161 people on board, was scheduled to land in Singapore at 8:57 a.m. local time.\n\nMurjatmodjo said teams were searching the sea and mountainous areas in the region.\n\nThe plane was several hours past the time when its fuel would have been exhausted, Indonesian officials said during a news conference Sunday.\n\nThe aircraft was on the submitted flight plan but was requesting deviation due to enroute weather before communication with the aircraft was lost while it was still under the control of the Indonesian Air Traffic Control, AirAsia said.\n\nAccording to flight tracking website Flightradar24, the jet was flying at the regular cruising altitude for most jetliners -- 32,000 feet -- when the signal was lost.\n\n\"At the present time we unfortunately have no further information regarding the status of the passengers and crew members on board, but we will keep all parties informed as more information becomes available,\" AirAsia said.\n\nThe captain in command had a total of 6,100 flying hours and the first officer a total of 2,275 flying hours, according to the airline. The aircraft had undergone its last scheduled maintenance on 16 November 2014.\n\nThe flight manifest for the the Airbus A320-200, with the registration number PK-AXC, released by the Indonesian authorities said there were 155 passengers on board, including one infant and 16 children.\n\nOf the passengers, 149 were Indonesians, three were South Korean, and there was one traveler each from Malaysia, Singapore and United Kingdom. Of the crew one was French and six were Indonesian, according to AirAsia.\n\nSearch and rescue operations were in progress, AirAsia said.\n\nI am touched by the massive show of support especially from my fellow airlines. This is my worse nightmare. But there is no stopping. \u2014 Tony Fernandes (@tonyfernandes) December 28, 2014\n\nThe plane lost communication with Indonesia's Surabaya airport 42 minutes after takeoff, when it was believed to be over the Java Sea between Kalimantan and Java islands, Hadi Mustofa, an official of the transportation ministry told Indonesia's MetroTV.\n\nMustofa said the plane had seven crew and 155 passengers.\n\nThe Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore said it was informed about the missing plane by Jakarta ground control about half an hour after contact was lost.\n\n\"Search and rescue operations have been activated by the Indonesian authorities,\" it said.\n\nThe Singapore air force and the navy also were activated with two C-130 ready to assist Indonesia authorities in the search, according to the aviation authority.\n\n\"We remain ready to provide any assistance to support the search and rescue effort\", the CAAS said.\n\nA waiting area was set up at Changi Airport in Singapore, where the plane had been scheduled to land, with facilities and support for relatives and friends of the passengers on the plane.\n\n\"My only thought are with the passengers and my crew. We put our hope in the SAR operation and thank the Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysian governments\", the GCEO of AirAsia tweeted.\n\nThe White House said President Obama was briefed on the flight.\n\nThis caps a terrible year for Malaysia and air travel.\n\nVery sad to hear that AirAsia Indonesia QZ8501 is missing. My thoughts are with the families. Malaysia stands ready to help. \u2014 Mohd Najib Tun Razak (@NajibRazak) December 28, 2014\n\nAir Asia is Malaysian based, and in March, Malaysia Airlines flight 370, a wide-bodied Boeing 777 with 239 people on board, went missing soon after taking off from Kuala Lumpur for Beijing.
