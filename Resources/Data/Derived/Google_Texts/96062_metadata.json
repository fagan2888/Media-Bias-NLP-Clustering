Bush, Islamophobia, p.c. culture, political correctness, News, Politics News\n\n\u201cOur nation is waging a war on a radical network of terrorists, not on a religion. And not on a civilization. As we wage this war to defend our principles, we must live up to those principles ourselves. And one of the deepest commitments of America is tolerance. No on should be treated unkindly because of the color of their skin or the content of their creed. No one should be judged by appearance or ethnic background, or religious faith.\u201d\n\nBack in 2002, when President George W. Bush made these comments at the annual White House Iftar Dinner, there was no outcry from his Republican colleagues for being too \u201cpolitically correct,\u201d or for avoiding the term \u201cradical Islam\u201d \u2014 which the president consciously refrained from using in speeches. No one questioned where the president\u2019s loyalties were, or whether the terrorists could be defeated if he didn\u2019t constantly emphasize their twisted Islamic ideology. After invading one Muslim country and planning to invade another, the Bush administration considered it wise to emphasize that the United States was not at war with a religion, especially a religion with over 1 billion followers.\n\nIn another speech shortly after the attacks of September 11, at the Islamic Center of Washington, D.C., Bush condemned the Islamophobia that had emerged across the country, declaring that Americans who felt they could \u201cintimidate our fellow [Muslim] citizens to take out their anger\u201d did not \u201crepresent the best of America,\u201d but \u201cthe worst of humankind.\u201d Once again, these statements were not at all controversial. As the president of the United States, Bush was expected to keep the peace, not exacerbate violence and hatred against religious minorities. While there could be sharp disagreements over foreign policy, being commander-in-chief required at the very least an appearance of calm and sensible leadership, not hysterical and alienating rhetoric. It had nothing to do with \u201cpolitical correctness,\u201d it was simply a matter of being presidential.\n\nToday, top Republican presidential candidates no longer subscribe to this kind of leadership. Over the past 10 months, GOP candidates have often given the impression that they are running for fearmonger-in-chief, rather than commander-in-chief, where new rules of leadership apply. For these candidates, levelheaded discourse is considered a sign of weakness, and thinking before speaking is deemed phony and \u201cpolitically correct.\u201d\n\nWhen our Democratic president avoids generalizations and confronts intolerance \u2014 as his Republican predecessor did \u2014 he is called \u201can apologist for radical Islamic terrorism\u201d by one of the current frontrunners. When he does not become hysterical after a terrorist attack and rejects discriminatory and bellicose rhetoric, he is considered soft \u2014 or worse, his loyalties are questioned.\n\nOf the three candidates left in the Republican primaries, the party\u2019s two biggest demagogues \u2014 Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) and Donald Trump \u2014 have managed to stay on top by being about as unhinged and impulsive as General Ripper from \u201cDr. Strangelove.\u201d And while communists are no longer trying to impurify all of our precious bodily fluids, now Muslims are, according to one of Cruz\u2019s foreign policy advisors, planning to implement Sharia law in America and destroy the West from within (starting with \u201cAmerica\u2019s first Muslim president\u201d).", "article_metadata": {"description": "The right has called Obama weak for preaching tolerance toward Muslims.
