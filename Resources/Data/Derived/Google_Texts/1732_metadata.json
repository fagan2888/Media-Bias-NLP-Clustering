Couples in wedding finery pose for photographs in front of illuminated shop windows, with Salvatore Ferragamo, Louis Vuitton and Gucci offering the sort of backdrop for romance more usually provided by the sea or the mountains. The women are not wearing Ferragamo\u2019s Vara pumps, with their distinctive bows, or toting Vuitton\u2019s subtly monogrammed handbags. They cannot afford them. Tran Van Cuon, who assembles mobile phones at a Samsung factory, posed with his fianc\u00e9e in a brown suit and bow tie that cost him the equivalent of $150. Some day he hopes to become a customer in the mall. Until then, he will proudly display the photos in his home.\n\nTo stumble across an outpost of European luxury in a relatively poor and nominally socialist country is not all that surprising. Luxuries such as silk have travelled long distances for many centuries, and even modern luxury-goods makers have been pursuing wealth in new places for more than a century. Georges Vuitton, son of Louis, the inventor of the world\u2019s most famous luggage, showed off the company\u2019s flat-topped trunks (better for stacking than traditional round-topped ones) at the Chicago World\u2019s Fair in 1893. The oil-rich Middle East has been a magnet for expensive foreign trinkets since the 1960s. The Japanese became insatiable consumers in the 1970s. Today, two in five Japanese are thought to own a Vuitton product. And now it is China\u2019s turn to lap up luxury.\n\nAs luxury-goods sales have expanded geographically, they have also spread across the social scale. When Coco Chanel created her No. 5 perfume in the 1920s she reserved it for her best couture clients, but in the following decade she sold it in smaller bottles so that more women could afford it. Cartier\u2019s \u201cLes Must\u201d jewellery in the 1970s put the brand within reach of consumers who could only yearn for Panth\u00e8re necklaces and Tank watches. Many other brands followed Cartier\u2019s sortie du temple (descent from the temple), seeking to broaden their appeal while retaining their cachet. Not all succeeded.\n\nOver the past 20 years the number of luxury-goods consumers worldwide has more than trebled to 330m, according to Bain & Company, a consulting firm. Their spending on expensive jewellery, watches, clothing, handbags and so on has risen at double the rate of global GDP. Most of these new buyers are not the very rich but the merely prosperous, with incomes of up to \u20ac150,000 ($188,000). Shares of listed luxury companies have far outperformed those of other companies (see chart).\n\nConsumers\u2019 rush to quality has created billionaires at a rate that Silicon Valley might envy, especially among the main shareholders of luxury conglomerates that have gathered together many of the best-known brands. They include Bernard Arnault, a French tycoon who controls LVMH, owner of Louis Vuitton, Mo\u00ebt & Chandon champagne and a host of other brands, and his rival Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault, whose Kering group owns Gucci, a big Italian leather-goods maker. Nick Hayek\u2019s Swatch Group and Johann Rupert\u2019s Richemont (Cartier\u2019s owner) are powerhouses in watches and jewellery. Among the owners who have made fortunes from selling stakes to investors in the past few years are Brunello Cucinelli, whose eponymous company makes casual-chic clothing at serious prices, and Remo Ruffini, a fellow Italian who floated Moncler, a maker of down jackets.\n\nPersonal luxury goods are just one small corner of this empire of opulence. Upmarket options can be found in industries from health care to banking, though most analysts leave such things out of their reckoning. Using consumers\u2019 own perception of what constitutes luxury goods and services, the Boston Consulting Group reckons that $1.8 trillion was spent on such items in 2012. The biggest category is travel, followed by cars and then personal luxury goods. Bain comes up with a smaller sum for a similar spread of sectors (see chart). But luxury\u2019s boundaries are fuzzy and hotly disputed.\n\nThis special report will concentrate on personal goods, which face the tricky task of trying to achieve global scale while maintaining the artisan roots that give them rarity appeal. Ultra-expensive cars will make only a brief appearance, and yachts will just sail by on the horizon: globally, only 14,000 people are able to afford a really big one. But the report will include such fast-growing \u201cexperiential\u201d sectors as hotels and wine, which are growing faster than things to buy and own.\n\nTo view the world through the lens of luxury is to see it subtly altered. Some of the normal rules do not apply to luxury-goods makers, even though in many ways they are similar to other consumer-goods companies. The cost of production is not usually a prime concern and capital investment is generally modest, except for watches. A really prestigious item can be a \u201cVeblen good\u201d, named after an American economist born in the mid-19th century who noticed that demand for some goods actually rises as they get more expensive because they confer yet more status. And the margins even on lesser luxury goods are much better than on mass-market items.\n\nLuxury companies like to set their own agenda. Their creative directors oversee both the development of new products and the way they are presented in magazines, shop windows and online. \u201cWe are not going to let people influence the vision,\u201d says Patrick Albaladejo, deputy managing director of Herm\u00e8s, a French luxury house so august it claims not to have a marketing department.\n\nLuxury companies often get the most attention for the things they sell least of. Karl Lagerfeld, Chanel\u2019s creative director, made headlines this year by sending his models down a catwalk decked out as a grocery shop. But \u201cthe bread and butter of the company are chemicals,\u201d explains Armando Branchini of the Altagamma Foundation, which represents Italian luxury firms. Luxury perfumes and cosmetics are thought to account for over half of Chanel\u2019s business.\n\nDiageo, a big drinks company, has a \u201cReserve\u201d division that gives special attention to its priciest tipples, such as Johnnie Walker Blue Label whisky. They are marketed through the patient cultivation of the coolest bars and influential \u201cadvocates\u201d. \u201cYou need to be a black belt in relationships when it\u2019s about luxury,\u201d says James Thompson, who runs the division.\n\nLuxury\u2019s lens does odd things to the map as well. Europe is still the pre-eminent maker; its brands account for 70% of the world\u2019s luxury consumption. Germany matters in cars and yachts, but the real powerhouse is Italy, which serves as the workshop for French fashion and leather goods as well as its own. Luxury is \u201cone of the few industries where Europe has a sustainable competitive advantage\u201d, says Michael Ward, managing director of Harrods, a posh London department store. America is both an underexploited market, given its wealth, and a base for brash competitors such as Coach, Michael Kors and Kate Spade, which are challenging established European brands with a more affordable take on luxury. China, already a voracious consumer, is just beginning to stir as an exporter.\n\nThe pope doesn\u2019t wear Prada\n\nOf late, though, the champagne has gone a bit flat. The war in Ukraine and the sanctions imposed on Russia in response have put off rich citizens of that country, among the giddiest new consumers. The Japanese went on a spree early this year ahead of a rise in value-added tax, then stopped spending. The Ebola epidemic in Africa and pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, where Chinese mainlanders do much of their shopping, have unnerved consumers. Most important, slower economic growth and the anti-corruption campaign mounted by Xi Jinping, China\u2019s leader, have dampened the spirits of Chinese shoppers, who now account for nearly a third of the global demand for personal luxury goods. The share prices of recently listed luxury companies have fallen by a quarter this year. After two decades when annual growth averaged nearly 6%, the rate this year will be just 2%, predict Bain and Altagamma.\n\nThese passing crises come on top of more profound changes. One of them is a shift from \u201chaving\u201d to \u201cbeing\u201d, especially in rich countries, where the well-off are becoming less keen on owning and more interested in experiencing things. Consumers in China are turning from monogrammed showiness to subtler elegance. Younger people everywhere have their own ideas about how to consume luxury, helped by social media and e-commerce. Inequality is a growing concern from Berlin to Beijing. Last year a pope whose red shoes were widely (but wrongly) thought to have been made by Prada, an Italian fashion house, gave way to one who shuns the Apostolic Palace for a guesthouse. That captures the mood and contributes to it.\n\nSobriety has bypassed some sectors, including fine wine and expensive cars. Yacht sales, too, are buoyant again after a period in the doldrums in the late 2000s, and today\u2019s yachtsmen often add a helicopter or two to their order. But mostly substance is winning over style.\n\nIn some ways, today\u2019s preoccupation with sustainability plays into the hands of luxury-goods makers. With their ample margins, they can afford to reduce the environmental damage they cause. \u201cLuxury can show the path that answers the major issues of our century,\u201d argues Marie-Claire Daveu, Kering\u2019s sustainability chief. By and large, makers of luxury goods employ European workers rather than sweatshop serfs in Bangladesh. The key trend now, says Diageo\u2019s Mr Thompson, is \u201caway from show for its own sake towards knowledge, appreciation, craft and heritage\u2014something with a story.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/50_by_50/images/print-edition/20141213_SRP002_1.jpg", "sailthru.flytitle": "Luxury", "description": "The modern luxury industry rests on a paradox\u2014but is thriving nonetheless, says Brooke Unger", "pubdate": 20141213, "og": {"site_name": "The Economist", "description": "The modern luxury industry rests on a paradox\u2014but is thriving nonetheless, says Brooke Unger", "title": "Exclusively for everybody", "url": "http://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21635761-modern-luxury-industry-rests-paradoxbut-thriving-nonetheless-says-brooke", "image": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20141213_SRP002_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "sailthru.rubric": "The modern luxury industry rests on a paradox\u2014but is thriving nonetheless, says Brooke Unger", "sailthru.date": "2014-12-11 14:14:56", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20141213_SRP002_1.jpg", "revisit-after": "1 day", "sailthru.tags": "Luxury", "fb": {"pages": 6013004059, "app_id": 173277756049645}, "sailthru.imagepath": "images/print-edition/20141213_SRP002_1.jpg", "articleid": 21635761, "sailthru.image.thumb_mfte": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/ec_related_article_image/images/print-edition/20141213_SRP002_1.jpg", "sailthru.web_section": "SR", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theeconomist"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20141213_SRP002_1.jpg", "site": "@TheEconomist", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "news_keywords": "Luxury"}, "article_summary": "Shares of listed luxury companies have far outperformed those of other companies (see chart).\nOver the past 20 years the number of luxury-goods consumers worldwide has more than trebled to 330m, according to Bain & Company, a consulting firm.\nIn some ways, today\u2019s preoccupation with sustainability plays into the hands of luxury-goods makers.\nAnd the margins even on lesser luxury goods are much better than on mass-market items.\nBy and large, makers of luxury goods employ European workers rather than sweatshop serfs in Bangladesh."}
