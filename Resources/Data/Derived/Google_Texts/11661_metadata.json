The latest version of this thinking comes from Commentary editor John Podhoretz, who spreads blame widely but takes care to blame Obama\u2019s alleged failure for all of the current trends in politics he dislikes:\n\nAfter the economic meltdown, Barack Obama acted boldly. He sought to fix the economy with a $1 trillion stimulus that did almost nothing. He promised to expand health-care and shrink its cost at the same time, a ludicrous and illogical promise that properly resulted in the kind of nihilistic cynicism he supposedly was elected to overcome.\n\nAs I have argued, one of the inherent problems with conservative dogma that make it vulnerable to an anti-intellectual demagogue like Trump is its disregard for expertise. Podhoretz\u2019s summary is interesting not because it is the central point of his column, but because it is not. He is offering a kind of shorthand summary of the Obama presidency as conservatives see it right now. Podhoretz\u2019s confident dismissal of Obama\u2019s record shows just how removed conservatives are from empirical reality.\n\nBegin with Podhoretz\u2019s belief that the stimulus \u201cdid almost nothing.\u201d It is almost completely impossible to find an economist who agrees with this proposition. A survey of academic economists found near unanimity that the stimulus reduced unemployment:\n\nEven if we take Podhoretz\u2019s claim more loosely and grant that he really meant to say the stimulus didn\u2019t reduce unemployment enough given its size \u2014 well, not many economists believe that either:\n\nAnd that\u2019s just among academic economists, who do include some devotees of various exotic fiscal theories embraced by conservatives. Among the macroeconomic forecasting field \u2014 that is, economists who predict these things for a living \u2014 there is unanimity that the stimulus helped the economy.\n\nPodhoretz\u2019s beliefs about the stimulus can\u2019t be disproven, of course, because a counterfactual is inherently unprovable. What can be disproven is his belief about health-care reform. Podhoretz claims Obama\u2019s promise to \u201cexpand health-care and shrink its cost at the same time\u201d was \u201cludicrous and illogical.\u201d He simply states this as a logical certainty, evidently convinced \u2014 as many conservatives are \u2014 that Obama\u2019s goals are so obviously irreconcilable that merely pointing out the contradiction is all that is required to mock it.\n\nBut of course there\u2019s no contradiction in hoping to expand access to health insurance and slow the long-term growth in its price. Coverage expansion is a onetime increase in aggregate spending based on increasing the number of people in the system. Bending the cost curve is a long-term reduction in the price of health care per person. It is depressing that so many conservatives cannot understand how the two goals can exist side by side.\n\nThe original projections for Obamacare did not assume that the law would reduce the total amount of health-care spending over the short term. Rather, it assumed that the coverage expansion would be paid for through a mix of spending cuts and higher taxes, and that the law\u2019s many reforms to hold down cost inflations would take place gradually. (To take just one, penalizing hospitals with excessive Medicare readmission rates has caused a sharp reduction in hospital-acquired infections, which reduces suffering and saves money.) But a funny thing happened. Health-care inflation came down very quickly. And premiums on the exchanges came in far lower than expected. As a result, the government is actually spending less on health care now than it was projected to spend before the passage of Obamacare:\n\nIn other words, the result is far more successful than even the law\u2019s advocates forecast. Contra Podhoretz, they did not believe Obamacare would reduce total health-care spending in the medium term. But that exact result has happened. Podhoretz shows no awareness that this has transpired. He simply proceeds with the same blithe assumption that it has not happened and only a complete idiot would believe it was even possible to happen.\n\nPodhoretz is not a fringe figure. He is closer to the left wing of conservative-movement thought than the right wing. Even the \u201creasonable\u201d members of the conservative movement, the ones aghast at the party\u2019s front-runner, are prisoners of a dogma that is totally disconnected from any realistic assessment of the world.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#000", "description": "John Podhoretz's revealing dismissal of the Obama agenda.", "generator": "the-factory", "og": {"site_name": "Daily Intelligencer", "description": "John Podhoretz's revealing dismissal of the Obama agenda.", "title": "Reminder: Even Trump-Hating Conservatives Are Still Pretty Crazy", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/01/even-trump-hating-conservatives-still-crazy.html", "image": "http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2016/01/21/21-obama-detroit.w1200.h630.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "John Podhoretz's revealing dismissal of the Obama agenda.", "creator": "@jonathanchait", "image": "http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2016/01/21/21-obama-detroit.w750.h560.2x.jpg", "title": "Even Trump-Hating Conservatives Still Crazy", "site": "@intelligencer", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Daily Intelligencer", "fb": {"app_id": 120608177953522}, "msapplication-TileImage": "//cache.nymag.com/media/di/icon.144x144.png", "application-name": "Daily Intelligencer", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "the national interest, politics, john podhoretz", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NewYorkMag", "tag": "the national interest,politics,john podhoretz", "published_time": "2016-01-22T20:51:00.000Z", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/JonathanChaitPublic"}, "topics": "topics-test, the national interest, politics, john podhoretz", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no"}, "article_summary": "The original projections for Obamacare did not assume that the law would reduce the total amount of health-care spending over the short term.\nContra Podhoretz, they did not believe Obamacare would reduce total health-care spending in the medium term.\nPodhoretz\u2019s confident dismissal of Obama\u2019s record shows just how removed conservatives are from empirical reality.\nHe is offering a kind of shorthand summary of the Obama presidency as conservatives see it right now.\nIt is depressing that so many conservatives cannot understand how the two goals can exist side by side."}
