One might think it inconceivable that the two could be celebrated by the same population, though retired United States Navy Seal Kristin Beck\u2014along with the estimated 15,000 transgender service members and veterans in the U.S.\u2014is eager to change such a mindset. SLUG spoke with Kristin about her experience on the front lines of this fight and her lifelong service in the name of justice for underrepresented people.\n\nThough our conversation began with small talk, I quickly discovered that nothing in Beck\u2019s life experience is small. The day prior, she was interviewed on Al Jazeera in Washington D.C., and then spent some time at the White House advising staffers on how to better implement Obamacare for the country\u2019s trans population.\n\nThe documentary film Lady Valor, which won the Audience Award at this year\u2019s Damn! These Heels LGBTQ Film Festival, documents Beck\u2019s decorated military career and current life in the public eye. In 1990, Beck joined the U.S. Marine Corps and later became a Navy Seal. Over the following 20 years, she took part in 13 deployments, seven of which were combat deployments. She retired from the Navy in 2011 and began her latest, most challenging mission in 2013 after publically revealing her gender identity\u2014 to raise awareness of transgender issues. Since coming out with her gender identity, Kristin has become one of the highest profile transgender figures in the U.S..\n\nLiving a life against the grain has been the norm for Beck since her teenage years. In high school, Kristin sported a mohawk and listened to punk and hardcore bands such as Black Flag, Suicidal Tendencies and Circle Jerks. A downhill skateboarder since the \u201970s, Kristin also shredded on a Burton board in the early \u201980s. \u201cIt was this basic piece of bent plywood with no edges, no nothing. It wasn\u2019t anything like snowboarding nowadays.\u201d Her early days as a skateboarding punk, and the internal conflict of having her gender identity diverge from the gender she was assigned at birth, honed Beck\u2019s empathy. \u201cJust because you have an outfit on, you can\u2019t judge a person by that,\u201d she says. \u201cI still lived a life of integrity and still sought out justice in my own ways,\u201d she says. Much like the skateboarder\u2019s slogan \u201cSkateboarding is not a crime,\u201d Beck sums up the trans struggle with, \u201cBeing human is not a crime.\u201d\n\nBeck\u2019s high profile transition thrust her into a national spotlight. Such a position has attracted the attention of supporters and detractors alike. One problem Beck is up against is misgendering, or referring to a person using terms that express the wrong gender, either accidentally on purpose. It\u2019s a huge issue that the transgender and gender non-conforming communities still face. \u201cIt does bother a lot of transgender people,\u201d she says. \u201cIt bothers them that they have before photos, and it bothers them that people use the old name or bring up anything about your old life. We\u2019re always judging people by how they look. Nobody wants to see the real person.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about her service in the military, as a now openly trans woman who would be barred from serving under the Department of Defense\u2019s instruction 6130.03, Beck doesn\u2019t hold any regrets or bitterness. \u201cMy old life is still my life,\u201d she says. \u201cThat person Chris, that Navy Seal, that bearded dude\u2014that\u2019s still me. Just because you changed your clothing and your hair gets a little longer, it doesn\u2019t change who you really are.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnce people make a mistake,\u201d Beck says, \u201cI can\u2019t be angry at \u2019em, \u2019cause maybe that\u2019s what they still see, or they haven\u2019t noticed or haven\u2019t seen a change. I have to give them the benefit of the doubt, at least for a little while, and let them grow or understand in their own way. And you know when somebody is being offensive, when somebody starts misgendering and saying \u2018He\u2019 and using all male pronouns and using my old name\u2014I know if they\u2019re doing it to bring offense. You can tell. If they start doing it offensively, then yeah, I\u2019ll make a point to it, I\u2019ll say something.\u201d\n\nIt is difficult to alter one\u2019s perception of an individual based on years of an already established relationship, but it is a challenge worth taking on. \u201cMost people\u2014my friends and even my family\u2014when they\u2019re [misgendering], they\u2019re going to figure it out,\u201d Beck says. \u201cAnd if they don\u2019t, then they don\u2019t, and that\u2019s their own loss\u2014it\u2019s their loss for not seeing somebody\u2019s spirit.\u201d\n\nTo those who still resist giving transgender individuals the respect that is any human being\u2019s birthright, Beck is still hopeful. \u201cAll they see is this outer covering, all they see is the clothing or the hair\u2014the spirit is what people should see,\u201d she says. \u201cThey color of my skin doesn\u2019t count, how long my hair is doesn\u2019t count, it\u2019s who you are inside that counts. And that\u2019s what a lot of people come to see\u2014they see me for who I am, regardless of what my name is or what my gender is or anything else\u2014you need to see me. We\u2019re all individuals, we\u2019re all equal, we should all be treated with respect and dignity.\u201d\n\nWhile there are many within the radical trans community who would prefer to abolish the military altogether, Beck is proud of her service\u2014and bridging gaps between divided communities and bringing attention to underrepresented groups is essential to her new mission. \u201cI\u2019m proud of my service,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m proud of my country. We do make mistakes and it\u2019s not always perfect. It\u2019s not always exactly right. I\u2019m proud of the fact that there are a lot of people working really hard to always do the right thing. I\u2019m proud of the overall goodness that our country does bring to this world.\u201d\n\nFollow Kristin Beck on Facebook and Twitter @TheLadyValor as she continues to travel the country to educate about transgender communities\u2014you may even see her on the Utah slopes or drinking Polygamy Porter at one of our local bars.
