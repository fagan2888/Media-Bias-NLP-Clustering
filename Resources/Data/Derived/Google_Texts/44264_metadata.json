Gentle bedtime ribbing and celebrity fawning gave way to sarcasm and goofiness and celebrity fawning, which now gives way to substantive interviews plus musical comedy plus celebrity fawning. The job description continues to evolve.\n\nAll we really need to know is that Jon Stewart is credited as an executive producer of \u201cThe Late Show with Stephen Colbert,\u201d and that provides assurance that the satirical political edge will remain sharp.\n\nPromising aspects of opening night were the interactions with Jon Batiste and the Stay Human band, the Oreo cookie binge as a metaphor for indulging in Donald Trump jokes, the nods to both Letterman and Jimmy Fallon, and the peek at what Colbert will be without his Comedy Central blowhard conservative mask. The George Clooney \u201cinterview,\u201d not so much.\n\nHis evolution is just beginning. The DVR is set for the next however many years.\n\n________\n\nUPDATE: He scored very well in the ratings.
