They will try to delete the Obamacare provision and send the spending bill back to the House for passage by September 30 in order to prevent government shutdowns the following day.\n\nHouse Republicans have now voted 42 times over the past few years to kill or significantly alter President Barack Obama\u2019s healthcare reforms, which aim to provide medical insurance for millions of Americans. Each time, the Senate has ignored the work of Republicans in the House.\n\nBut this time, they have attached the measure to a must-do bill that funds many government agencies in the fiscal year starting October 1. If the House and Senate fail to resolve their differences by then, these agencies would have to shut down until the legislative dispute is resolved.\n\nThe Senate is expected to debate the bill next week, which would maintain strict, across-the-board spending cuts that were laid out as part of a 2011 deficit-reduction law.\n\nBesides the need to quickly approve the spending measure, Congress also is fighting over separate legislation to raise the limit on U.S. borrowing authority.\n\nLawmakers are staring down a floating deadline of sometime in October or early November to either pass a measure or hurl the U.S. government into its first credit default.\n\n(Reporting By Richard Cowan and Thomas Ferraro; Editing by Mohammad Zargham and Grant McCool)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://darkroom.baltimoresun.com/2013/09/sept-20-photo-brief-house-derails-obamacare-lines-form-for-new-apple-iphone-blue-sheep/", "type": "article", "site_name": "The Darkroom: Exploring visual journalism from the Baltimore Sun", "title": "Sept. 20 Photo Brief: House derails Obamacare, lines form for new Apple iPhone, blue sheep"}, "twitter": {"creator": "@BaltSunPhoto", "url": "http://darkroom.baltimoresun.com/2013/09/sept-20-photo-brief-house-derails-obamacare-lines-form-for-new-apple-iphone-blue-sheep/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://darkroom.baltimoresun.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/md-fog-standalone-p1.jpg"}, "title": "Sept. 20 Photo Brief: House derails Obamacare, lines form for new Apple iPhone, blue sheep", "site": "@baltimoresun", "card": "photo"}, "fb": {"app_id": 311287685604598}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Sept. 20 Photo Brief: House derails Obamacare, lines form for new Apple iPhone, blue sheep19 photosU.S. House of Representatives derails Obamacare, lines form for new Apple iPhone, blue sheep art project in Germany and more in today\u2019s daily brief.\nBesides the need to quickly approve the spending measure, Congress also is fighting over separate legislation to raise the limit on U.S. borrowing authority.\nIn a partisan vote of 230-189, the Republican-controlled House sent the measure to the Senate where Democrats hold a majority.\nThey will try to delete the Obamacare provision and send the spending bill back to the House for passage by September 30 in order to prevent government shutdowns the following day.\nIf the House and Senate fail to resolve their differences by then, these agencies would have to shut down until the legislative dispute is resolved."}
