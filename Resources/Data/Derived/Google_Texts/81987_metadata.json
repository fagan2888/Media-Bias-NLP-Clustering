The GOP playbook also provides a \u201cFREE AMERICA\u201d poster, overlaid on the iconic image from the movie Free Willy.\n\nIt\u2019s a riff on the news that SeaWorld is one of several large companies that capped its workers\u2019 hours, possibly to avoid complying with Obamacare. Inspired by Chait, we decided to unpack why the GOP\u2019s Free Willy allegory doesn\u2019t make any sense, either.\n\n1) Presumably, in this allegory, Obamacare is the theme park where Willy is trapped. In the movie, the park has ensnared Willy because it wants to use him to make money. The GOP\u2019s gripe about Obamacare is that it\u2019s going to cost money.
