Sonja Sharp for The Wall Street Journal\n\nKillol Butala can\u2019t read the Telugu-language magazine sitting in front of him on the counter of Butala Emporium, and he can\u2019t decipher most of the dozen other South Asian scripts gracing his newsstand in Queens.\n\nBut for the first time since he began following Indian politics more than 20 years ago, the Jackson Heights shopkeeper is confident they all say the same thing.\n\n\u201cPeople are very enthusiastic about it,\u201d Mr. Butala, who came to America about 17 years ago, said of this weekend\u2019s victory for the country\u2019s longtime opposition, the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party and its popular leader Narendra Modi. \u201cIn my lifetime, I haven\u2019t seen something like this.\u201c\n\nThe staff at Patel Brothers Grocery just up the block on 74th Street were even more emphatic. The moment they read the election results, they hung a bright green sign over the outdoor produce section congratulating India\u2019s next prime minister.\n\n\u201cThis is a big victory of Indian democracy,\u201d said manager Nikita Desai, 35. \u201cPeople have a lot of hope in him.\u201d\n\nThat hope is strongly tied to promises of economic reform and infrastructure improvements along the lines of what Akta Patel, 31, said she saw in her home state of Gujarat while Mr. Modi was chief minister there.\n\nMagazines in Jackson Heights, Queens. Sonja Sharp for The Wall Street Journal\n\n\u201cI just came here two years ago so I\u2019ve experienced it. The transportation, the roads, the highways\u2014because of him there is good progress in Gujarat,\u201d said Ms. Patel, who works at a clothing shop. \u201cMy friends, my family, everybody gave their votes to him.\u201d\n\nOthers said they believe the Bharatiya Janata Party will act more aggressively than its predecessor, the Congress party, when it comes to relations with Pakistan and China.\n\nBut not everyone was celebrating in Queens. Nanik Pamnani, 72, an employee at clothing store India Sari Palace, said he was concerned about the Hindu nationalist party\u2019s ability to work with India\u2019s religious minorities, and practice diplomacy on increasingly complex world stage.\n\n\u201cThe Congress was soft, they believed in dialogue,\u201d he said. \u201cThese people, there\u2019s no history about them, so it\u2019s hard to say. I\u2019m watching cautiously.\u201d\n\nWhat do you think of the election results?
