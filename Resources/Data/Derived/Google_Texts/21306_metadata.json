Obama will be in Miami on Wednesday to talk immigration. Olivier Douliery/Getty Images\n\nHappy Hump Day, the 56th day of 2015 and the third month since President Barack Obama took executive action to shield from deportation millions of immigrants in the country illegally \u2013 a move that not only bolstered his approval among Latinos (some of whom had derided him as \u201cdeporter-in-chief\u201d) but also drove a stainless steel wedge inside the Republican Party (see below). Today, the president heads to sunny Miami with three goals: bolster his immigration cred, set the table for Hillary Clinton and crank up the pressure on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker John Boehner, who are still furiously trying to broker a cease-fire on the issue between factions inside their own caucus. Here\u2019s your Three-Minute Briefing, all the News You Can Use in 180 seconds or less.\n\n[READ: DHS' Johnson Pleads for Funding as Congress Stalls]\n\nHe Also Won\u2019t Salute Capt. Obvious: Another day, another development in the serial drama, \u201cMr. Netanyahu Goes to Washington.\u201d On Tuesday, the Israeli prime minister politely but firmly rejected an invitation to meet with Senate Democrats on Capitol Hill. Netanyahu says he won\u2019t talk to the Dems privately because he doesn\u2019t want to \u201ccompound the misperception of partisanship\u201d surrounding his visit. But he ignited controversy by accepting a backdoor invite to address Congress from Boehner, who did not consult the White House or the Democrats, some of whom are boycotting the speech.\n\nSe Habla Minority: In a review of its 2012 electoral face plant, the Republican National Committee said it needed to bring in more minorities in order to win the White House. Now, a new joint survey confirms it, and GOP pollster Whit Ayres says the party\u2019s 2016 presidential prospects can\u2019t rely on middle-class whites any more: They\u2019re gonna need African-Americans and Latinos to turn out in record numbers \u2013 and vote for them \u2013 if they\u2019re ever going to take back the White House. Good luck with that.\n\nThis Governing Stuff Is Hard: The stalemate with Democrats over a bill linking Department of Homeland Security funding to Obama\u2019s executive action on immigration has opened up a new front between moderates and hard-liners in the Republican civil war. Politico reports that verbal fighting broke out Tuesday at a closed-door GOP strategy meeting: Centrists want a bill decoupling the two issues, but conservatives think a DHS shutdown is the way to teach Obama they\u2019re not to be trifled with, even though polls show they\u2019d get serious blowback if that happened.\n\nJeb\u2019s Glass Jaw: He\u2019s declared he\u2019s \u201chis own man,\u201d despite a last name that has opened more doors \u2013 and more big-donor wallets \u2013 than a concierge at the Four Seasons. But Jeb Bush, who\u2019s claimed the Moderate Republican mantle amid a raging debate between party centrists and tea party radicals (see above) is probably going to have to fight in the Mitt Romney style \u2013 right-handed \u2013 if he wants to win the nomination, and is vulnerable to the same right hook that nearly leveled Romney in the 2016 campaign.\n\nBlast from the Past, Hold the \"Potatoe\": This won\u2019t help Mr. I\u2019m My Own Man\u2019s image as the radical, independent, \u201cnew kind of Republican\u201d: Jeb\u2019s invited his dad\u2019s old partner, former Vice President Dan Quayle, out from the shadows of political obscurity to help him raise some money for his Right to Rise super PAC.\n\nYour Morning Video: For you youngsters, \u201cMurphy Brown\u201d was a popular CBS sitcom about a high-powered Washington newswoman who, over the course of the series\u2019 decadelong run, becomes a single mom \u2013 and arguably fires the opening shot in the ongoing Culture Wars:\n\nLeaning Left: In her first major appearance this year, Hillary Clinton owned up to presidential ambitions (duh!) but also channeled her inner Elizabeth Warren during a speech in Silicon Valley on Tuesday, needling the tech sector for its seemingly impenetrable glass ceiling and calling for a serious discussion on income inequality. She also took some questions, collected $300,000 for her speech and made some fundraising contacts in a region long considered the Democrats\u2019 campaign ATM machine.\n\n[ALSO: Progressives Won\u2019t Take No For an Answer on an Elizabeth Warren]\n\nCritical Condition: The number of people without health insurance is falling because of the Affordable Care Act, including in some red states whose governors haven\u2019t lifted a finger to bring Obamacare to their constituencies. The Washington Post\u2019s Greg Sargent reports that the data, from a new Gallup/Healthways survey out this week, raises the stakes for the controversial King vs. Burwell anti-Obamacare lawsuit, which could eviscerate federal subsidies tied to the act and cause dozens of state insurance exchanges to implode.\n\nTweet of the Morning: When it comes to pop culture \u2013 and other things \u2013 Vice President Joe Biden is, unlike Quayle, a lover, not a fighter:\n\nLeslie Knope and VP Biden together one last time.
