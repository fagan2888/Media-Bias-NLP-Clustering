It was more along the lines of, \u201cHow do I get out of it without hurting my wallet?\u201d\n\nAs of Monday morning, these are the most popular questions listed on Healthcare.gov\u2019s website:\n\nJeryl Bier, who has a talent for ferreting out interesting tidbits and glaring inconsistencies from federal websites, made the discovery and posted it on The Weekly Standard.\n\nThe more the public becomes aware of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s higher-than-normal premiums, excessive co-pays and annual deductibles in the thousands of dollars, the more it wants no part of it.\n\nRasmussen released the results of its latest telephone survey Monday, indicating that 50 percent of Americans oppose the individual mandate requiring most Americans to purchase health insurance, while 36 percent approve.\n\nThat confirmed an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll conducted earlier in the month that found 44 percent of respondents thought the health care law was a bad idea, while only 31 percent approved of it.\n\nU.S. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., told U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, that he should try Obamacare \u2014 he might like it, the Huffington Post reported.\n\nSimilarly, Democratic National Committee Chairwoman and U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., said that after Americans have experienced Obamacare, \u201cthey\u2019re not going to want to let it go,\u201d according to HotAir.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s easy for Schumer and Wasserman Schultz to make such claims \u2014 they made themselves exempt from the law\u2019s individual mandate.\n\nU.S. Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., who helped draft and later supported Obamacare, referred to the law\u2019s implementation as a \u201ctrain wreck coming.\u201d\n\nI think of it as a beached whale \u2014 something that will naturally suffocate and die from its own weight.\n\n.\n\n[poll id=\u201d105\u2033]", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "BizPac Review", "description": "One day before the health care exchanges go into effect, the most popular question Americans posed to the government isn\u2019t, \u201cCan I purchase insurance before the Jan. 1, 2014, deadline?\u201d or, \u201cCan I add my 36-year-old son who\u2019s living in my basement to my policy?\u201d Nope!
