TRENTON – The Henry J. Austin Health Center will expand its pediatric dental services as well as primary care services at its headquarters on Warren Street in Trenton after receiving funding from the Affordable Care Act to treat uninsured area residents.

The center announced Wednesday that it will use $228,200 to expand the dental and primary care services which are currently only offered at the Henry J. Austin Health Center on Ewing Street.

“HJAHC has made great strides to provide same-day-access to established patients, said Dr. Kemi Alli, Chief Medical Officer at Henry J. Austin Health Center.

The move to expand the availability of these services will allow patients to receive all different forms of care in the same visit, a spokeswoman for the center said.

“However, like in many urban areas, the challenge has always been funding for new providers,” Alli said. “The ACA funding will help us hire a new provider, decreasing the gap in primary care services.”

Dental director at the center Dr. Devin Goodman said the Ewing Street pediatric dental program, which began in February 2013, has been very successful and he anticipates the same success for patients who receive services at the Warren Street center.

“Parents often times have questions about their child’s oral health before the age of two,” Goodman said. “This program helps parents get involved with their child’s oral health at the very beginning.”
