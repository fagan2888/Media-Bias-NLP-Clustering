Voters have less concern over those traditional priorities for candidates in exchange for another quality altogether \u2013 authenticity. While pundits bemoan the rise of political novices and demagogues who have enough of that currency to prosper, that shift comes from a rational reaction to American politics over the last generation, and both Democrats and Republicans alike share the blame for the shift.\n\nIn 2010 and again in 2014, Republicans won back control of Capitol Hill by promising not just to stop Barack Obama\u2019s agenda but reversing it, even though simple majority control in Congress isn\u2019t sufficient to do so while Obama remains president. The GOP overpromised and under delivered--a classic set-up for discouragement and backlash.\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s Why Trump and Other Outsiders Are Leading the GOP\n\nDemocrats have not performed much better with their own base. Obama and the party\u2019s leadership have sounded the usual progressive-populist alarms about Wall Street and supersized banks and corporations, but have done nothing to address those issues. The Obama administration has never prosecuted any corporate leaders over the financial collapse that led to the Great Recession, a point made by Ben Bernanke this past week, despite their fanning of Occupy Wall Street\u2019s rhetorical flames.\n\nVoters are tired of hearing promises and heated rhetoric that turn out to be mere posing, and they want people who say what they think and mean.\n\nTherefore, it\u2019s not a big surprise to see people in both parties turn to outsiders, whether they\u2019re named Donald Trump, Ben Carson, or Bernie Sanders. Voters are tired of hearing promises and heated rhetoric that turn out to be mere posing, and they want people who say what they think and mean. They crave connections to real people, not prepackaged politicians regurgitating focus group tested talking points. As one Wisconsin voter told me, \u201cBernie Sanders is connecting with people because he\u2019s not flapping with the wind. We know what he believes. That\u2019s important to a lot of people.\u201d\n\nSanders has upended what appeared to be a second straight coronation attempt by Hillary Clinton by remaining authentic. The former secretary of state has had issues on that quality since the Clintons entered the national political scene, but it has only grown worse \u2013 and not just because of the e-mail scandal.\n\nLast year\u2019s book tour turned into another exercise in false victimhood, with Hillary Clinton claiming that the two had left the White House in 2000 \u201cflat broke\u201d \u2013 despite buying a second home in New York and running a successful bid for the US Senate. The avalanche of ridicule that followed, as well as the lack of any authentic candor about Clinton\u2019s experiences in either the book or the interviews, buried any hope of a soft-sell entry into the 2016 presidential race.\n\nRelated: Sensing an Advantage, Clinton Skewers GOP on Benghazi Probe\n\nNow with the e-mail scandal moving into a full-scale FBI probe, Clinton\u2019s authenticity crisis has reached its nadir. Only a third of voters in three key swing states (Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania) believe Hillary to be honest and trustworthy, while two-thirds put their trust in Joe Biden. This may seem ironic, given that Biden\u2019s first presidential bid collapsed due to his plagiarism, but it points to the weakness of Clinton\u2019s position.\n\nEven more than Clinton, Biden would be the de facto incumbent and represent the Obama administration and its disappointments.\n\nBiden has largely avoided damage by staying out of the race, but he might well have the same issues if he jumps in soon. Even more than Clinton, Biden would be the de facto incumbent and represent the Obama administration and its disappointments. Plus, Biden has long championed the corporate class that the progressive Left detests, thanks to the deep interests his home state of Delaware has in them.\n\nThis past week, though, Clinton got a gift from House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who told Sean Hannity that the Benghazi Select Committee had purposefully damaged her presidential hopes. The Clinton campaign latched onto this as though it were the smoking gun in an Agatha Christie novel, and launched its first national TV spot trying to argue once again for her authentic victimhood. \u201cThe Republicans finally admit it,\u201d the narrator dramatically intones to argue that all of the woes that beset Clinton are merely partisan attacks from another vast right-wing conspiracy.\n\nEven if the McCarthy remarks could make a winning argument, Hillary Clinton undermines it with ridiculous aggrandizement and imperious attitudes\n\nThat doesn\u2019t square, however, with an active FBI investigation and the discovery of secret e-mail systems. Even while going on the attack over McCarthy\u2019s remarks, Clinton still insists that she has done no wrong \u2013 and that investigating those activities go \u201cbeyond the pale.\u201d NBC\u2019s Savannah Guthrie couldn\u2019t quite swallow that, asking her in reply, \u201cDo you get how bad this looks?\u201d Clinton responded by claiming to have \u201cgone further [in transparency] than anybody that I\u2019m aware of in American history.\u201d\n\nRelated: Why Donald Trump Is Vladimir Putin\u2019s Favorite Candidate\n\nThat won\u2019t sell voters on Clinton\u2019s authenticity. It demonstrates that even if the McCarthy remarks could make a winning argument, Hillary Clinton herself undermines it with ridiculous aggrandizement and imperious attitudes.\n\nThe natural flow of American politics after eight years of a single president will play against Democrats unless they find an outsider with broader appeal than Sanders to derail Clinton. In this cycle, the candidates who can establish themselves with authenticity and accomplishment stand to emerge as the favorites in the end. Clinton has claims to neither.\n\nBut neither will the Republican Party win this by default. If they want to earn trust again, they need a candidate not just with authenticity, but who can articulate a reasoned set of expectations and convince voters that he or she will accomplish them. Otherwise, we will find ourselves back in this same situation four years from now, only with even less engagement from voters.\n\nAuthenticity means more than just a personal connection \u2013 it means delivering on those promises, a lesson both parties are learning the hard way in 2015.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Forget experience, policies, and ideology in the 2016 presidential primary fights, in", "title": "The Coming Danger of the \u2018Throw the Bums Out\u2019 2016 Election", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2015/10/08/Coming-Danger-Throw-Bums-Out-Election", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Donald%20Trump_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2015/10/08/Coming-Danger-Throw-Bums-Out-Election", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Donald%20Trump_1.jpg", "creator": "@EdMorrissey", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Forget experience, policies, and ideology in the 2016 presidential primary fights, in", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "That\u2019s important to a lot of people.\u201dSanders has upended what appeared to be a second straight coronation attempt by Hillary Clinton by remaining authentic.\nIt demonstrates that even if the McCarthy remarks could make a winning argument, Hillary Clinton herself undermines it with ridiculous aggrandizement and imperious attitudes.\nEven more than Clinton, Biden would be the de facto incumbent and represent the Obama administration and its disappointments.\nRelated: Sensing an Advantage, Clinton Skewers GOP on Benghazi ProbeNow with the e-mail scandal moving into a full-scale FBI probe, Clinton\u2019s authenticity crisis has reached its nadir.\nRelated: Here\u2019s Why Trump and Other Outsiders Are Leading the GOPDemocrats have not performed much better with their own base."}
