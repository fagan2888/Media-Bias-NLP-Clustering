That\u2019s why a substantial chunk of the volunteers who were supposed to participate on Thursday sent in their last-minute regrets, he said.\n\nBut the flu was also a motivation for at least some homeless people to show up, said Zac Sanders of the Free Clinic of Southwest Washington, one of 30 agencies and businesses that set up shop inside the church. Flu shots were a new feature for Homeless Connect this year, Bilby said.\n\n\u201cThey really appreciate it because they are out in the cold and they know they\u2019re more at risk,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cThey don\u2019t have access to sanitation, hot showers, hand washing that prevents things from spreading.\u201d When they do get sick, he added, it can get serious quickly. Lack of access to health care \u2014 or trying just not to deal with the illness \u2014 may mean winding up in the emergency room with something that was easily preventable, he said.\n\n\u201cWe are always trying to reach this population, which can be very hard to reach,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nIn another room, Kaiser Permanente podiatrist Dr. David Griffin and a couple of foot-care nurses were reaching for feet that have spent too much time cold, wet and on the streets. Griffin offered William Wegener, an unemployed welder whose diabetes has led to some numbness in his feet and hands, some instruction and brochures about caring for his extremities and avoiding any more nerve damage.\n\n\u201cWelding\u2019s a good career. I just want to make sure we get your feet in shape so you can work,\u201d Griffin told Wegener. \u201cYou see trouble, you get help right away, OK?\u201d Then he passed Wegener on to the donated footwear and shoe-fitting experts of Vancouver shop Fit Right NW.\n\n\u201cWe just want to provide good, quality care,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cThis is a great way to help some of the most neglected of our fellow citizens.\u201d He added that 80 percent of Americans are wearing the wrong-sized shoes.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to get back to work as soon as possible,\u201d said Wegener, 49. The San Diego native said he\u2019s been welding since age 19 \u2014 except for the stretches when layoffs led to drinking, drugs and other troubles. He\u2019s got a transitional apartment now but he\u2019s been homeless more than once, he said. Lately he\u2019s been spending his days with Friends of the Carpenter, a woodshop and day center for the homeless, because staying busy and connected is what prevents him from resuming bad habits, he said.\n\nHe knows he\u2019s always \u201ca step away\u201d from homelessness again, he said. \u201cI put myself in that bad position before,\u201d he acknowledged. \u201cNow I\u2019m trying to make the right decisions.\u201d\n\nJoan Caley, a nurse and nursing teacher as well as a commissioner for the Vancouver Housing Authority, brings her senior nursing students at the University of Portland to this event to do foot care every year, she said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re in their community health clinical rotations,\u201d she said. \u201cThis gives them a chance to learn to talk to this population and see what this is like.\u201d\n\nVolunteers from local churches, clinics, businesses and nonprofit and government agencies also offered free haircuts, chiropractic care and massage, dental exams and hygiene, vision exams and glasses, access to social services and benefits, transportation resources and connections to employment and housing opportunities.\n\nLarry Stevens was waiting for a chiropractic session; he said he isn\u2019t able to work due to serious arthritis all over his body. He spent some time living in his van, he said, and he\u2019s grateful to be in a transitional apartment now.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not homeless but if it wasn\u2019t for help like this, I would be,\u201d he said. \u201cIt ain\u2019t no fun not being able to work.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Attendance was visibly down from previous years at Thursday's Project Homeless Connect, the annual roundup of services, benefits and hands-on care hos", "application-name": "", "og": {"site_name": "The Columbian", "description": "Attendance was visibly down from previous years at Thursday's Project Homeless Connect, the annual roundup of services, benefits and hands-on care hosted by the Council for the Homeless and St. J", "title": "Event helps Homeless make Connections", "url": "http://www.columbian.com/news/2015/jan/29/helping-homeless-make-connections/", "image": "http://16749-presscdn-0-94.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/themes/columbian/static/img/columbian_c_200x200.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "columbian.com", "creator": "_ScottHewitt", "site": "@thecolumbian", "card": "summary", "title": "Event helps Homeless make Connections"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#3A5B7C", "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"admins": 1256005586, "app_id": 122928857737763}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://16749-presscdn-0-94.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/themes/columbian/static/img/windows-tiles/square-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thecolumbian", "section": "Carousel,Charities and nonprofits,Latest News,Life,Local News,News,Vancouver", "published_time": "2015-01-29 16:00:00"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca56d\"", "article_summary": "I just want to make sure we get your feet in shape so you can work,\u201d Griffin told Wegener.\nHe\u2019s got a transitional apartment now but he\u2019s been homeless more than once, he said.\n\u201cWe just want to provide good, quality care,\u201d Griffin said.\n\u201cI\u2019m not homeless but if it wasn\u2019t for help like this, I would be,\u201d he said.\n\u201cYou see trouble, you get help right away, OK?\u201d Then he passed Wegener on to the donated footwear and shoe-fitting experts of Vancouver shop Fit Right NW."}
