But should it make contact with the East Coast, relief organization Samaritan\u2019s Purse is ready to step in.\n\nWhile meteorologists track the hurricane\u2019s every move (most recently suggesting it will stay well offshore)\u2014and the White House enters disaster preparation mode\u2014Tim Haas, manager of U.S. Disaster Relief for Samaritan\u2019s Purse, is hard at work.\n\n\u201cOur Samaritan\u2019s Purse disaster relief experts are monitoring the heavy rains and the potential impact that Hurricane Joaquin may have on the East Coast,\u201d Haas said in a statement to The Daily Signal.\n\nSamaritan\u2019s Purse, a non-denominational evangelical Christian organization, is poised to quickly respond in disaster situations, like Hurricane Joaquin, in the United States and around the world. They offer emergency relief in over 100 countries.\n\n\u201cWe stand ready to deploy at a moment\u2019s notice to help storm victims recover,\u201d Haas continued.\n\nWhen Hurricane Sandy, the deadliest hurricane to hit the northeastern part of the United States in 40 years, hit in 2012, Samaritan\u2019s Purse responded within hours.\n\n\u201cWe began bringing physical help and spiritual comfort to homeowners affected by the hurricane out of our bases in New Jersey and New York. We have worked on over 1,000 homes,\u201d reads a statement on their website of their efforts after Sandy.\n\nThis week alone, Samaritan\u2019s Purse teams responded to wildfires in Northern California and provided refugee support in Croatia.\n\nThe organization was founded in 1970 and is headed by Franklin Graham, son of famous evangelist Billy Graham. The organization has headquarters in Boone, North Carolina.\n\nOffering physical and spiritual aid, the organization is known for its yearly \u201cOperation Christmas Child\u201d gifts distributed to needy children in more than 130 countries, emergency medical care given in response to crisis situations, and ability to quickly source volunteers.\n\nOver the past 17 years, 83,000 volunteers have provided U.S. disaster relief alongside Samaritan\u2019s Purse staff, helping more than 28,000 families affected by natural disasters in the United States. Those disasters have ranged from ice storms and tornadoes to wildfires and hurricanes in the United States, as well as wars and famines abroad.\n\nIn disaster situations such as a hurricane, teams help provide emergency supplies, clean up disaster sites, and repair and rebuild homes. They have five tractor-trailers, called disaster relief units, stocked with tools and supplies and ready to be deployed to disaster scenes.\n\n\u201cThe greatest advance that America could make in preparing for catastrophic disasters is to build better individual-based programs, a culture of preparedness, and resilient and self-reliant communities,\u201d The Heritage Foundation Vice Presidents James Carafano and Jennifer Marshall wrote in a research paper entitled \u201cGrassroots Disaster Response: Harnessing the Capacity of Communities.\u201d\n\nSamaritan\u2019s Purse also partners with local churches in affected communities to arrange housing for volunteers and staff during relief efforts. These volunteers often stay at a disaster site after the initial response has left.\n\n\u201cThe survivors of a major disaster require immediate, personal relief,\u201d Carafano\u2019s and Marshall\u2019s research concludes. \u201cThe government is simply not equipped to provide for all of these needs\u2014especially survivors\u2019 spiritual needs\u2014but by partnering with faith-based and community groups before a disaster, government (local, state, and federal) can help survivors receive a higher quality of immediate attention and guarantee long-term support.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The relief organization, a non-denominational evangelical Christian organization, is ready to provide aid if necessary.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The relief organization, a non-denominational evangelical Christian organization, is ready to provide aid if necessary.", "title": "Samaritan's Purse 'Ready to Deploy' Should Joaquin Strike", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/SP.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-10-02T19:08:21+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1VuLDNX"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The relief organization, a non-denominational evangelical Christian organization, is ready to provide aid if necessary.", "title": "Samaritan's Purse 'Ready to Deploy' Should Joaquin Strike", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/SP.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Health Care", "tag": "public health", "published_time": "2015-10-02T11:59:05+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-02T19:08:21+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Hurricane Joaquin, Samaritan\u2019s Purse, disaster relief, eastern shore, hurricane, weather"}, "article_summary": "But should it make contact with the East Coast, relief organization Samaritan\u2019s Purse is ready to step in.\nDisaster Relief for Samaritan\u2019s Purse, is hard at work.\nThis week alone, Samaritan\u2019s Purse teams responded to wildfires in Northern California and provided refugee support in Croatia.\nThey have five tractor-trailers, called disaster relief units, stocked with tools and supplies and ready to be deployed to disaster scenes.\nSamaritan\u2019s Purse, a non-denominational evangelical Christian organization, is poised to quickly respond in disaster situations, like Hurricane Joaquin, in the United States and around the world."}
