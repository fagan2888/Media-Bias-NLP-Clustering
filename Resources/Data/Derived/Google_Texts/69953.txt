Taran Killam, Anna Kendrick

Anna Kendrick handled hosting duties at Saturday Night Live for the first time this weekend, in an episode that offered a few memorable moments among mostly mediocre sketches.

Highlights included the sure-to-go-viral music video "Dongs All Over the World," starring Kendrick, Aidy Bryant, Kate McKinnon, Sasheer Zamata and Cecily Strong, as well as George R.R. Martin (Bobby Moynihan) stopping by "Weekend Update" to discuss the new Game of Thrones book he's working on.

The best and worst series finales

Check out some of the night's better sketches below:

Fox and Friends: SNL's lampooning of Fox and Friends is always dependable, and this sketch about Obamacare, featuring Kenan Thompson as Neil deGrasse Tyson, is no exception. Corrections include "Michelle Obama has never done porn" and "Noah is not found footage."

"Dongs All Over the World": Tired of being jilted by their boyfriends, five women travel across the world in an attempt to conquer all the dongs.

Weekend Update: George R.R. Martin: A "burnt-out" George R.R. Martin stops by "Weekend Update" to talk about the difficulty he's having writing the next two books in the Game of Thrones series. "What do you do with your time?" Cecily Strong wonders.

French Dance: On the French teen soap "Les Jeunes de Paris," spontaneous dance parties often break out in the show's setting, a hip caf√©.

Big Joe: Bobby Moynihan plays a trapped miner who's hoping Big Joe (Taran Killam) can save him.
