Mr. Krauthammer cited voters\u2019 feeling of betrayal by conservative leaders who didn\u2019t deliver on their promises to adhere to conservative orthodoxy (repeal Obamacare, defund Planned Parenthood, stop \u201cPresident Obama\u2019s tax-and-spend hyperliberalism\u201d).\n\nGOP voters rejected the ideology of the Republican Party for the past seven years, which has been to deny anything that would look like a victory for President Obama. This ideology of \u201cno\u201d has led to increased mistrust of government, continued crumbling of infrastructure and anemic economic growth. And where there have been conservative leaders who have been able to imprint the conservative ideology on government (for example, Kansas, Louisiana and Michigan), the state has failed its people.\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump has offered to break this cycle of \u201cno and less\u201d in a different way, by promising \u201cyes and more\u201d to getting things done that help people. The GOP voters chose Mr. Trump because he refused to adhere to the recent conservative ideology of \u201cno.\u201d They want their government to work for them, not against them.\n\nMaurice Werner, Washington\n\nCharles Krauthammer expressed the dismay of many Republicans over the triumph of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. Mr. Krauthammer noted that, in exit polls, up to 60 percent of GOP voters said they feel \u201cbetrayed\u201d by their leaders because of the failure of the GOP-dominated Congress to roll back Obamacare, defund Planned Parenthood and attack other GOP targets.\n\nThe premise is wrong. The electorate is not so much charmed by anti-government ideology as it is concerned about the government\u2019s failure to respond to people\u2019s very real concerns: jobs, health care, affordable housing and other practical issues. Sixty-two percent of the public supports the Supreme Court ruling on Obamacare upholding health-insurance subsidies. Gallup reports that 59 percent of Americans view Planned Parenthood favorably. In 2013, The Post reported that 53 percent of Americans blamed the GOP for the government shutdown. Mr. Trump\u2019s unexpected success with GOP voters should be a wake-up call that Americans are primarily seeking not ideological purity but a government that listens and seeks to address their real-life needs.\n\nElizabeth R.
