The Massachusetts senator has repeatedly denied she is interested in running for the White House. However, her recent campaign stumping for Democratic candidates \u2014 as well as a planned trip to Israel \u2014 have stoked the 2016 speculation.\n\nClinton and Warren do agree on some issues, but on a variety of issues, their policies clash.\n\nExpanding social security\n\nDuring her 2008 presidential bid, Clinton was relatively non-committal about reforms to the Social Security program while Warren has not minced words.\n\n\u201cSeniors have worked their entire lives and have paid into the system, but right now, more people than ever are on the edge of financial disaster once they retire \u2014 and the numbers continue to get worse,\u201d she said last November.\n\n\u201cThat is why we should be talking about expanding Social Security benefits \u2014 not cutting them. Social Security is incredibly effective, it is incredibly popular, and the calls for strengthening it are growing louder every day.\u201d\n\nClinton has been more coy on the issue of entitlements. She said in 2007 that certain reforms such as cutting benefits, privatizing the program or raising the retirement age were \u201coff the table.\u201d There were some articles at the time that gave mixed signals on whether she would be willing to increase payroll taxes.\n\nOne account from the Associated Press featured a conversation between a campaigning Clinton and an Iowa voter in which the candidate said she might consider committing more of workers' income to Social Security.\n\n\u201cShe told him she didn't want to put an additional tax burden on the middle class but would consider a \u2018gap,\u2019 with no Social Security taxes on income from $97,500 to around $200,000. Anything above that could be taxed,\u201d according to the article. The idea was similar to then-Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards, who was seen as to the left of Clinton.\n\nBack then, workers paid taxes toward Social Security on their first $97,500 in earnings \u2014 any earnings above that remain untaxed. (Now that amount stands at $117,000.)\n\nUltimately, Clinton officially shied away from the increase in taxes, and stuck with official comments that revolved around improving the economy overall.\n\n\u201cWe need to get back to the fiscal responsibility that we had in the 1990s, when we weren't draining the Social Security fund any more,\u201d she said.\n\nSurveillance programs\n\nDuring the promotional tour for her book \u201cHard Choices,\u201d Clinton stood behind the U.S. surveillance programs and criticized former government contractor Edward Snowden for leaking sensitive information.\n\nMost of what Snowden disclosed, she said, \u201cconcerned the surveillance that the United States undertakes, totally legally, against other nations.\u201d\n\nWhile she has backed reforms to \u201cmake sure that it doesn\u2019t go too far,\u201d Clinton told NPR that \u201ccollecting information about what's going around the world is essential to our security.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere were other ways that Mr. Snowden could have expressed his concerns,\u201d such as reaching out to Congress, Clinton continued.\n\n\u201cI think everyone would have applauded that because it would have added to the debate that was already started. Instead, he left the country \u2014 first to China, then to Russia \u2014 taking with him a huge amount of [sensitive] information,\u201d she said, adding that during her trips to Russia, she would leave all electronics on the State Department plane with the batteries out to prevent hacking.\n\nWarren would like to end the bulk-collection of phone records, which is authorized by Section 215 of the USA Patriot Act and set to expire June 1, 2015.\n\nEven though Warren praised the Obama\u2019s administration\u2019s reforms of its surveillance apparatus earlier this year, she said they might not go far enough.\n\n\u201cCongress must go further to protect the right to privacy, to end the NSA's dragnet surveillance of ordinary Americans, to make the intelligence community more transparent and accountable,\u201d Warren said.\n\nBankruptcy reform\n\nIn the Senate, Clinton voted for an overhaul to the bankruptcy system that would have made debt forgiveness more difficult for borrowers to obtain. She said in 2008 that she regretted the vote, but it still could become a sticking point, as it did when she faced off with then-Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.).\n\nThe credit card lobby pushed hard for the legislation, which did not prevail when Clinton voted for it in 2001, but did become law after another attempt by Congress in 2005. (Clinton did not vote in that round, telling reporters she missed the vote to be with Bill Clinton after his heart surgery.)\n\n\"The right kind of reform is necessary,\u201d Clinton said in a press release about the legislation in 2001. \u201cWe're on our way toward that goal, and I hope we can achieve final passage of a good bankruptcy reform bill this year\u201d\n\nDuring her initial presidential campaign, she said she would have voted against the 2005 bill that eventually passed.\n\nWarren specialized in bankruptcy law and personal-finance issues while teaching at Harvard Law School. She had been published and widely quoted in national media before becoming a big player on the Washington scene in 2008 as chair of the Congressional Oversight Panel, a watchdog panel that oversaw the economic stimulus.\n\nIn 2006, Warren blasted the new law as ineffective at curbing fraud, which was the impetus for its passage.\n\n\u201cThe new laws will drive up the costs for debtors and shrink the protection available, but that doesn't necessarily mean that fewer people in trouble will turn to bankruptcy,\u201d she told the Atlanta-Journal Constitution.\n\nFree-trade agreements\n\nWithin the populist Democratic movement, there is a rising tide against once-popular trade deals connecting the U.S. with foreign lands. Clinton has been involved with many of the pacts from her time as first lady, in the Senate and finally, as part of the Obama administration.\n\nClinton saw herself in the middle of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) during her husband\u2019s presidency. She supported deals with Oman, Chile and Singapore during her tenure in the Senate. As secretary of State, she was a chief advocate as talks commenced surrounding the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), one of the largest worldwide deals in recent history.\n\nMany proponents of the agreements argue that negotiations need to take place in secret in order to protect the fragile interests of participating countries. This has not sat well with public interest groups and more liberal members of the Democratic Party, including Warren.\n\nLast year, she went to far as to vote against Obama\u2019s then-nominee for the head of the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, Michael Froman, because of that lack of transparency as the 10 countries involved in the TPP discuss terms.\n\n\u201cI have heard the argument that transparency would undermine the Trade Representative\u2019s policy to complete the trade agreement because public opposition would be significant,\u201d she said in a floor speech. \u201cIn other words, if people knew what was going on, they would stop it. This argument is exactly backwards. If transparency would lead to widespread public opposition to a trade agreement, then that trade agreement should not be the policy of the United States.\u201d\n\nAt the State Department, Clinton didn\u2019t address specifics in the negotiating process, but told attendees at an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum conference that she hoped it would \u201ccreate a new high standard for multilateral free trade.\u201d\n\nCritics have said that the agreement would ease regulations protecting both laborers and the environment, despite claims from Clinton to the contrary.\n\n\u201cOur goal for TPP is to create not just more growth, but better growth. We believe the TPP needs to include strong protections for workers, the environment, intellectual property, and innovation,\u201d Clinton said at the event in 2011. \u201cIt should also promote the free flow of information technology and the spread of green technology, as well as the coherence of our regulatory system and the efficiency of supply chains.\u201d\n\nGlass-Steagall\n\nWarren has long positioned herself as an adversary to large financial institutions, questioning why they hadn\u2019t brought bankers who had been partially responsible for the financial downturn to trial. Last year, she introduced legislation that would reinstate Glass-Steagall, the Depression-era law that created a firewall between commercial and investment banking and was repealed during the Clinton administration.\n\n\u201cWe should not accept a financial system that allows the biggest banks to emerge from a crisis in record-setting shape while working Americans continue to struggle,\u201d Warren said at an event in 2013.\n\nThe financial services industry fought against Warren\u2019s idea of creating the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). It also made clear it would oppose any move to have her run the bureau.\n\nClinton, meanwhile, has been painted by critics as beholden to Wall Street, giving paid speeches at events sponsored by banking executives and maintaining ties with former officials who had been more laissez-faire with financial regulatory policy. As a senator from New York, bankers had been Clinton\u2019s constituents and largest donors.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "There are five major policy areas that shed daylight between Clinton and Warren.", "description": "There are five major policy areas that shed daylight between Clinton and Warren.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Ballot Box"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "There are five major policy areas that shed daylight between Clinton and Warren.", "title": "Clinton vs. Warren: Where they disagree", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/215817-clinton-vs-warren-where-they-disagree", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/warrenclinton_1.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-08-24T09:06:24-04:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2014-08-24T09:06-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/215817-clinton-vs-warren-where-they-disagree", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2014-08-24T09:00-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Megan R.
