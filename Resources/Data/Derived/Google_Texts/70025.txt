Ralph Abraham has only been in congress for a couple of months and now he's back in his home district to talk about what's going on in Washington.

Thursday afternoon the Monroe Chamber of Commerce held a luncheon with congressman Ralph Abraham as the guest speaker.

Abraham gave an update to the chamber about what's going on in congress. We caught up with him to ask a few questions.

"As far as the 47 senators that signed the letter, I would have signed the letter, I'll tell you that right now," says Abraham.

Abraham says if Iran doesn't understand our constitution they need to.

"If it takes a letter from republicans or democrats to explain that to them I don't care. Israel has got to be protected they are our ally in the middle east," says Abraham.

Abraham says Iran needs to know the us is looking for a good deal.

"Why would you want to give a nuclear weapon to a terrorist state," says Abraham.

We asked congressman Abraham how he feels bout iran fighting in Iraq.

"Iran is helping the Iraqi army dislodge ISIS. They are from the same set of claws and they are very deadly people we do not trust."

As far as the ouster of the Affordable Care Act, Abraham says as a doctor he lives it everyday.

"On the physician end its bad but more importantly on the patients end, they can't get the drugs they need, a lot of doctors don't take it," says Abraham.

In June, Abraham says they will get a ruling from the Supreme Court and if they rule that the subsidies are illegal, as republicans they have a plan ready to go.
