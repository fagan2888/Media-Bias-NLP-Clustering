REUTERS/Larry Downing (UNITED STATES - Tags: POLITICS) - RTR2BZER\n\n3970044\n\nThe president is facing his worst crisis of his five-year tenure. So where is the first mate of the Obama administration, good ol\u2019 Joe Biden?\n\nThe vice president is in Houston, Texas, and he\u2019s flying to Panama Nov. 20, far away from the crisis, from the president and from media questions about Obamacare.\n\nHe was home in Delaware on Nov. 17 after spending the previous three days in a New York, North Carolina and Georgia. On Nov. 13, he joined President Barack Obama for a closed-door White House meeting with advocates of greater immigration.\n\nHe met with military commanders on Nov. 12, spent the weekend of Nov. 11 and 10 at home in Delaware, and met with veterans Nov. 9. He stumped for Terry McAuliffe Nov. 4, in Virginia\u2019s gubernatorial race, warning voters that the GOP candidate was \u201cextreme.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s running for president in 2016, but running away from Obamacare in 2014.\n\nThe crisis is so bad that on Nov. 14, President Barack Obama defended himself by denying that he was stupid.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m accused of a lot of things, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m stupid enough to go around saying, this is going to be like shopping on Amazon or Travelocity a week before the website opens if I thought that it wasn\u2019t going to work,\u201d told a roomful of TV cameras and reporters.\n\nThat\u2019s a real political crisis. But that day, Biden was 600 miles from Obama\u2019s podium.\n\nHe was in Atlanta, Ga., trying to flatter a roomful of foreigners who had just earned or won one of life\u2019s greatest prizes, American citizenship.\n\n\u201cThank you for choosing us \u2013 thank you for concluding America was worthy of your aspirations,\u201d he told the group of immigrants from 50 impoverished, autocratic or backward countries, according to a White House blog entry.\n\n\u201cThe truth of the matter is you\u2019ve been Americans for a long time, long before you raised your right hand today, because you\u2019ve all adhered to the idea of America,\u201d Biden said, rhetorically inviting everyone on the planet to come and live alongside 300 million Americans.\n\nHaving accomplished that outreach to new voters, Biden then flew off to N.C. for Nov. 15 fundraiser for Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan, leaving him 400 miles from Obama\u2019s side.\n\n\u201cThe only way to break through this gridlock is with people who can earn the trust of people on the other team, that\u2019s why she\u2019s so valuable,\u201d Biden declared, according to the pool report.\n\nBut the report also noted that Biden declined to defend, praise or even acknowledge the existence of Obamacare.\n\n\u201cNeither Hagan nor Biden mentioned the Affordable Care Act nor the problems with healthcare.gov,\u201d said the pool report.\n\nBiden did join Obama for a Nov. 6 meeting with 15 Democratic Senators who are up for election in 2014. But that was a closed-door meeting intended to calm increasingly agitated Democrats, not a public defense of the unpopular program.\n\nThat meeting came one day after he called three Democratic town councillors in Iowa for their election victories.\n\nBiden was caught by one reporter two weeks ago, on Oct. 30, and semi-apologized for the failure of the Obamacare network\u2019s website.\n\n\u201cWe assumed that it was up and ready to run, but the good news is that although it\u2019s not, and we apologize for that, we\u2019re confident that by the end of November it will be and there will still be plenty of time for people to register to get online,\u201d a subdued Biden told HLN TV.\n\n\u201cNeither he or I are technology geeks and we assumed it was up and ready to run\u2026 I don\u2019t know the technical reasons,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I became a lawyer,\u201d he said.\n\nBefore October, however, Biden was an enthusiastic supporter of the federal network.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s how it\u2019s going to work,\u201d Biden gushed in a Sept. 29 op-ed for the Des Moines Register and other newspapers.\n\n\u201cStarting Tuesday, you can go to HealthCare.gov, where you\u2019ll be able to comparison shop for health insurance plans. It\u2019s simple\u2026 Pick the option that works best for you, sign up, and you\u2019re done,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cIt used to be that buying insurance was a nightmare\u2026 After Tuesday, it\u2019ll never be that way again,\u201d he declared.\n\n\u201cWe fought to bring affordable health care to all Americans, and because of the president\u2019s insistence \u2014 and persistence \u2014 we are delivering,\u201d Biden announced.\n\nFollow Neil on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Neil Munro", "description": "VP keeps a low profile as Obamacare implodes", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "The president is facing his worst crisis of his five-year tenure.
