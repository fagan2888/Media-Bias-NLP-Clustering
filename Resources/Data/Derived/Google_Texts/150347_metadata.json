She\u2019s a weekly political columnist for the Wall Street Journal, the country\u2019s largest newspaper by circulation, which also hosts her irregularly updated blog. The Sunday shows seek her out when filling the ranks of their weekly pundit panels. She\u2019s among the more influential commentators in American media, and the fact that she inhabits this perch despite being objectively terrible at her job should obliterate whatever faith you have in the concept of meritocracy.\n\nNoonan\u2019s chief failing is one that afflicts many pundits: She generally has no idea what she\u2019s talking about. Her analysis is powered largely by her own warped perception of politics and policy, which she confidently ascribes to the rest of the country. Peggy Noonan always seems to know exactly what \u201cAmerica\u201d is thinking, and this often results in her being hilariously wrong.\n\nLast month she chastised public health officials for their refusal to impose a travel ban on countries suffering through Ebola outbreaks, calling it insulting to the intelligence of the American people. \u201cIf we don\u2019t momentarily close the door to citizens of the affected nations,\u201d she wrote, \u201cit is certain that more cases will come into the U.S.\u201d Her recommendation \u2013 the thing she actually wrote in her widely read and influential column \u2013 was to think like \u201ca group of 11-year-olds,\u201d who would surely understand the need for a ban. \u201cEleven-year-olds would get this one right without a lot of struggle.\u201d No ban was imposed, and no Ebola-infected people have flown into the U.S., dealing a rough blow to the policy wisdom of sixth graders.\n\nToday, Noonan weighs in yet again on some \u201cgreat domestic issues\u201d facing the nation and demonstrates yet again that she doesn\u2019t actually understand politics and policy as they exist outside of her own head.\n\nOn the Affordable Care Act, Noonan thinks that it\u2019s been dealt a fatal blow by Grubergate (it hasn\u2019t) and tries to sketch out a way forward based on \u201cwisdom.\u201d Here\u2019s her recommendation:\n\nI don\u2019t know how ObamaCare will go, but it won\u2019t last as it is. If the White House had wisdom, they\u2019d declare that they\u2019d won on the essential argument\u2014health coverage is a right for all\u2014and go back to the drawing board with Congress. The only part of the ObamaCare law that is popular is its intention, not its reality. The White House should declare victory and redraw the bill. But the White House is a wisdom-free zone.\n\nThis is laughable, absurd and completely wrong. \u201cObamacare\u201d is unpopular, but many of its most important features \u2013 guaranteed coverage for preexisting conditions, expanded Medicaid, allowing young people to stay on their parents\u2019 health plans, tax credits to buy insurance \u2013 are pretty well liked. But the White House has won the argument, she contends, so the obvious next step is for President Obama to completely retreat and give in to Republican demands to scrap his signature domestic policy achievement. And then he should work on devising a new health law with Congress, which will be completely controlled by the party that does not believe health coverage is a right, and which has defined itself by its ferocious opposition to working with Obama on anything, healthcare policy most of all.", "article_metadata": {"description": "America's worst pundit wants to build Keystone XL so we can impress the world and build character in wayward youths", "title": "Peggy Noonan\u2019s \u201cwisdom\u201d: Build Keystone XL so American boys will become men", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "America's worst pundit wants to build Keystone XL so we can impress the world and build character in wayward youths", "title": "Peggy Noonan\u2019s \u201cwisdom\u201d: Build Keystone XL so American boys will become men", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/11/21/peggy_noonans_wisdom_build_keystone_xl_so_american_boys_will_become_men/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/05/peggy_noonan.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "America's worst pundit wants to build Keystone XL so we can impress the world and build character in wayward youths", "title": "Peggy Noonan\u2019s \u201cwisdom\u201d: Build Keystone XL so American boys will become men", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/05/peggy_noonan.jpg", "creator": "@SimonMaloy", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Simon Maloy", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Affordable Care Act, Africa, conservative media, ebola, Ebola outbreak, ebola virus, Healthcare Reform, Keystone XL, Keystone XL pipeline, Media Criticism, Obamacare, Peggy Noonan, political pundits, Punditry, Wall Street Journal", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: Affordable Care Act, Africa, conservative media, ebola, Ebola outbreak, ebola virus, Healthcare Reform, Keystone XL, Keystone XL pipeline, Media Criticism, Obamacare, Peggy Noonan, political pundits, Punditry, Wall Street Journal, Media News, Politics NewsPeggy Noonan has one of the most high-profile jobs in American media.\nThe White House should declare victory and redraw the bill.\nBut the White House is a wisdom-free zone.\nIf the White House had wisdom, they\u2019d declare that they\u2019d won on the essential argument\u2014health coverage is a right for all\u2014and go back to the drawing board with Congress.\n\u201cEleven-year-olds would get this one right without a lot of struggle.\u201d No ban was imposed, and no Ebola-infected people have flown into the U.S., dealing a rough blow to the policy wisdom of sixth graders."}
