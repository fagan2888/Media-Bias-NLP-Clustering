A Salt Lake City man had a piece of his teenage years returned to him when police found his old shotgun, which had been stolen 37 years earlier.

In 1977, when Richard Pittenger was 16 year old, he was out on a date with a girl when someone broke into his truck and stole his new shotgun.

Police returned the weapon to Mr. Pittenger Wednesday after it turned up at a sporting goods store in Albany, Oregon, and a serial number search showed it was stolen, the Associated Press reported.

Mr. Pittenger, now 53, said he’s not sure what he will do with the gun now that it’s been returned.

“I don’t know the history of it. I don’t know if it was used to hurt someone over the years,” he said, AP reported.

Mr. Pittenger said his father took him to buy the 20-gauge shotgun, which he used to hunt rabbits with his friends as a teenager.

“I wish they could return my youth rather than just the gun,” he said with a smile, AP reported.

Property crimes are usually extremely difficult for police to solve because there is often little evidence to start an investigation, according to Salt Lake City police Det. Rod Van Scoy. If investigators do find stolen items, then it is usually shortly after the robbery. Mr. Pittenger’s shotgun is the oldest recovered property case the detective could recall.

“If you have a serial number it might take 37 years, but we’ll get your property back, hopefully,” Mr. Van Scoy said, AP reported.
