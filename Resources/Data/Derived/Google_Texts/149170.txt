* Get ready for our descent into the dark depths of tyranny:

President Obama’s pledge to pursue “audacious” executive action during his final year in office is stirring a frenzy of speculation about what he might have up his sleeve. White House chief of staff Denis McDonough this week said “audacious” executive actions on tap for 2016 are being carefully crafted to “make sure the steps we have taken are ones we can lock down and not be subjected to undoing through [Congress] or otherwise.” But with only 12 months left in office, the president is increasingly constrained in what he can accomplish. Finalizing executive orders and regulations takes time, and the administration is already scrambling to put in place dozens of executive orders and regulations that have already been announced. A White House official was non-committal when asked about which specific executive actions the president might be considering.

Step one: Replace Washington, Lincoln, Jefferson and Roosevelt in the Washington Nationals’ Presidents Race with Marx, Engels, Lenin and Trotsky.

* Donald Trump brings his unique brand of pandering to Liberty University:

Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump promised to “protect Christianity” during his Martin Luther King, Jr. Day convocation address at Virginia’s evangelical Liberty University. “We’re going to protect Christianity,” Trump told the audience. “I can say that, I don’t have to be politically correct.” The GOP candidate made several pointed attempts to appeal to the young, Christian crowd during his address, mentioning his pride in his Protestant faith and his oft-repeated campaign promise that the phrase “Merry Christmas” will become repopularized if he moves into the Oval Office. While promoting his book “The Art of the Deal,” he made sure to note that “the Bible blows it away. There’s nothing like the Bible.”

You know who knew how to make a deal? Yahweh. Terrific deal-maker. One of the best.

* Some Republican candidates say that when it comes to Iran, when they’re president they’ll Reagan like Reagan did, with extra Reagan. Steve Benen reminds us of Ronald Reagan’s actual record on Iran. Here’s a hint: Guess which president sold them weapons to give to terrorists?

* Jamil Smith reminds us of Martin Luther King’s radical politics, at a time when even conservatives celebrate a sanitized version of King.

* Rebecca Traister notes that last night’s was the fourth Democratic debate without a question on reproductive rights, which is particularly odd given that Hillary Clinton has been loudly advocating to overturn the Hyde amendment.

* Jonathan Chait makes the case against Bernie Sanders, namely that he offers a vision no more realistic than Barry Goldwater’s or George McGovern’s.

* Jonathan Cohn explains Sanders’s newly released single-payer health-care plan.

* Michael Tomasky says that questions about Sanders’s age are perfectly legitimate, given that he’d be the oldest president in history.

* Tierney Sneed reports on the status of the GOP replacement plan for the Affordable Care Act. Let’s say prospects don’t look good.

* Harold Meyerson says that last night’s debate showed that Hillary Clinton is a fox and Bernie Sanders is a hedgehog.
