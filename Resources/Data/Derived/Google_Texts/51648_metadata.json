I stood up straighter than I had in seven long months. I may have even let out a tear or two. Happy tears. Relieved tears. Tears of a mother who no longer has to worry that little kid\u2019s tendencies toward hurting themselves could send my family into financial chaos.\n\nWe no longer have to pay out of pocket for his doctor\u2019s visits. We no longer have to take him to a separate clinic, with a doctor who makes me uncomfortable, to get his vaccines. We no longer have to worry that if I uselessly panic (again) sending us to the hospital at 2 a.m. on a Tuesday, that it will cost us the equivalent of a month\u2019s rent, or more. Most importantly: if something really does go wrong, we don\u2019t have to worry that we will spend his college fund on healthcare bills.\n\nAnd we can afford it. Albeit still expensive, the Healthcare.gov marketplace is saving us $250 per month over his previous plan (the one that got canceled because it didn\u2019t get paid.) And this plan has no deductible! So there are few out of pocket costs associated with his doctor\u2019s visits. Whereas before, even with insurance, we paid for a majority of his healthcare as a newborn\u2013 nine months later we are paying much less for more benefits. I never thought I would get so excited over something so boring as insurance.\n\nBut it\u2019s not boring. It\u2019s potentially life saving. And my child\u2019s life is worth all this political strife. So is yours. It\u2019s worth the arguments with the tea partiers. It\u2019s worth the electoral battles. It\u2019s worth the headaches that have been associated with being a Democrat post 2010. It\u2019s worth the fights that will continue until the ACA is fully implemented and perfected, and every parent in a similar situation in every state can have the relief I felt on January 1.\n\nHappy and HEALTHY New Year to all!", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://sandiegofreepress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/baby-checkup.jpg"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "It\u2019s potentially life saving.\nI never thought I would get so excited over something so boring as insurance.\nWhereas before, even with insurance, we paid for a majority of his healthcare as a newborn\u2013 nine months later we are paying much less for more benefits.\nBy Lauree BentonEditor\u2019s Note: This is a follow up to a previous contribution, \u201cOne Woman\u2019s Story: Why I Will Be Enrolling in the ACA (Obamacare) Marketplace.\u201dMy baby boy has insurance!\n\u2026my child\u2019s life is worth all this political strife."}
