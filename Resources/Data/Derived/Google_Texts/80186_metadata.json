The girl was 14 years old but functioned at the level of a 9-year-old, according to the suit filed this week in federal court.\n\nT.W. reported in 2013 that another student, identified as 20-year-old V.A., had grabbed her buttocks and hugged and kissed her, even though she told him to stop, the lawsuit states. She also alleged that he repeatedly tried to pull her into a restroom at the back of the special education classroom.\n\nAfter the girl complained, the suit states, the school moved V.A.\u2019s seat in the classroom to directly in front of the restroom. Therefore, it says, he had easy access to the restroom in January 2014 when he followed the girl there, forced her to have oral sex and raped her.\n\nDISD could not be reached for comment Thursday.\n\n\u201cThey should have heeded the complaints that she and others made about the boy,\u201d said Hal Browne, an attorney for the girl\u2019s family. \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t have put her in harm\u2019s way by putting this man in front of the restroom when he\u2019d already told her he would drag her in there.\u201d\n\nThe girl has transferred to another school, a change the suit says was \u201cextremely difficult and disruptive\u201d for a student with a disability.\n\nThe girl\u2019s mother is suing DISD for compensatory and punitive damages.\n\nMother sues DISD alleging rape of special needs student", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RoZXNjb29wYmxvZy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDE1LzExL2xhd3N1aXQtMTQteWVhci1vbGQtd2l0aC1zcGVjaWFsLW5lZWRzLXdhcy1yYXBlZC1hdC1kaXNkLWhpZ2gtc2Nob29sLmh0bWwv", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Sarah Mervosh", "og": {"site_name": "The Scoop Blog", "description": "The mother of a girl with mental and physical disabilities has sued Dallas ISD, alleging that her daughter was raped by another student with a disability.
