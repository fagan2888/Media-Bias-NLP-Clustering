One lucky Colorado resident will be $2 million richer after checking their Powerball numbers.

A winning Powerball ticket was sold in Greenwood Village at the King Soopers store on South Holly Street, said spokeswoman for Colorado Lottery Kelly Tabor.

“They might be in tomorrow, or they might be in whenever they figure out they have a winner. It can take a while sometimes,” Tabor said.

The player has 180 days to claim the bounty, she said.

Tabor said the winner matched 5 out of 5 numbers and chose the Power Play option for an additional $1 that doubles the player’s prize.

“That’s why they won $2 million instead of $1 million,” Tabor said.

Tabor said the jackpot of $261 million has not been won yet.

Another Colorado resident of currently unknown location won $20,000 in last night’s drawing, Tabor said.

“It was a pretty good night for Colorado,” she said.

The $2 million winning numbers were 16 – 19 – 20 – 29 – 33 with a Powerball number of 10.
