Many of Colorado\u2019s heaviest marijuana users, meanwhile, appear to be quite happy sticking with medical pot, which they were able to obtain long before Amendment 64.\n\nMedical pot is cheaper (7.62 percent sales tax in Denver as opposed to 21.12 percent at retail outlets) and more widely available. And while it requires a doctor\u2019s permission, that has been notoriously easy to secure.\n\nHeavy users \u2014 those who consume marijuana every day \u2014 \u201cdrive almost 70 percent of total marijuana demand,\u201d the Department of Revenue study says. No wonder medical marijuana sales dwarfed retail sales in the first four months of this year \u2014 $133 million vs. $70 million \u2014 while tax revenues from retail pot are lagging far behind projections.\n\nNinety-four percent of medical pot users cite \u201csevere pain\u201d as their condition. You too might discover severe pain requiring treatment if your marijuana habit was costing so much.\n\n\u201cIt was initially thought that medical marijuana patients would purchase marijuana in the retail market, but it is increasingly clear that this conversion will not occur as long as the large price differential persists and as long as retail marijuana is not available in as many jurisdictions as medical marijuana,\u201d the state study concludes.\n\nBut if medical marijuana patients aren\u2019t converting in Denver, where retail pot is readily available, why should we suppose they will convert anywhere else given more retail shops?\n\nPrice and availability may not be the only reasons for medical marijuana\u2019s unexpected resilience, either. The fact that medical and retail pot establishments are allowed to co-locate on the same premises \u2014 in apparent violation of Amendment 64 \u2014 no doubt has propped up medical sales, too.\n\nIt\u2019s all but forgotten now, but the amendment passed in 2012 said, \u201cNothing in this section shall be construed to permit any medical marijuana center \u2026 to operate on the same premises as a retail marijuana store.\u201d\n\nAnd yet thanks to the legislature\u2019s decision to flout the constitution, co-location is actually the norm.\n\nThe governor\u2019s task force on Amendment 64 last year recommended \u201ccomplete\u201d physical separation between the two types of stores, but lawmakers approved rules saying medical and retail shops could share the same space so long as there were no sales of medical marijuana to patients under 21.\n\nThe result in Denver, according to the city\u2019s executive director of marijuana policy, Ashley Kilroy, is that 85 of the city\u2019s 90 retail stores sell both medical and retail pot, and just 21 have separate entrances and facilities.\n\nGiven this state of affairs, dreams of a tax bonanza from retail marijuana may have to be put on hold. Heavy users drive marijuana sales and they have a strong incentive to use cheaper medical marijuana. And marijuana store owners have no incentive to convert solely to retail sales given the convenience of operating both types of outlets.\n\nBut at least we\u2019ve made the tourists happy with our new retail shops.\n\nE-mail Vincent Carroll at vcarroll@denverpost.com.
