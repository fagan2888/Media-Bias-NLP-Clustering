I am a veteran. The construction cost overrun for the Veterans Affairs hospital in Aurora, together with the VA waiting list scandal, should be viewed as a wake-up call and opportunity. Both events show that the current VA system is a relic and an anachronism in 2015. It no longer serves our veterans and the country well.

In my opinion, the current VA facilities should be auctioned off to existing medical systems, and its employees should be re-deployed to existing health care providers to serve our veterans. A new payment system, for veterans only, operated on a parallel basis with our existing Medicare system, with suitable veteransâ€™ benefits, could be substituted.

This change would not only be more efficient, it would also result in a more flexible system going forward and provide many veterans with services closer to their homes.
