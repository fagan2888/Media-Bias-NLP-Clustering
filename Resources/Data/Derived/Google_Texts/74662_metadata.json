Hickey moved to the corner office of BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee on Sept. 1, taking the reins of a company that is navigating change in nearly every aspect of its industry.\n\nHickey is tasked with running the insurer at a time when reforms, and consumer demand, are reshaping the way nearly everyone pays for \u2014 and accesses \u2014 health care and insurance coverage.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act set out to reform much of the health care landscape. The impact on health insurers is immense. The companies sell more directly to members while trying to work with providers to keep medical costs down.\n\nThe challenges to insurance, be it managing costs, talking to newly empowered consumers or thinking about balancing premiums with access to care, make headlines. For Tennesseans the changes add fear to an issue that, for many, is already complex.\n\n\"Health coverage is a kitchen table issue for many people. We touch people the best and worst times in their lives,\" he said. \"You make these changes and you will have an impact. ... A lot of it requires a fair amount of self-education. They tend to go to family members. They tend to go to providers. We try to be here for as many of those questions as we can be.\"\n\nTraditionally, the bulk of BCBST members came from employer-sponsored plans. That is changing. It insured 3.3 million people at the end of September, nearly one-third from what it calls its retail book, which includes the federally run health insurance exchange, Medicare Advantage and a program that allows TennCare members to choose from three managed care organizations.\n\nIt's a health insurance era marked by rapid change. The company is \"blessed with pretty much every national competitor\" as it tries to attract consumers to increasing numbers of retail products, Hickey said.\n\nIn the broader health insurance space, there are massive proposed mergers as insurers look for cost savings and efficiency. Hickey said BCBST's 70-year history as an independent Blues plan is a strength that differentiates it from national insurers.\n\nIt recently had to re-earn one of its top five accounts, which had plans with both BCBST and a national competitor. BCBST won not only its account but the account from its competitor as well.\n\n\"When we asked them afterward what was the difference, there were a few big things,\" Hickey said. \"One was when they had an issue, when they had a priority, we were there. We were there in an hour, and it\u2019s not a regional representative who is going to go pass something back. It\u2019s me. ... It\u2019s Dr. (Andrea) Willis (chief medical officer) if it\u2019s a medical issue.\"\n\nHickey, 44, who holds dual medical and law degrees from Duke University, talked to The Tennessean about where he's spending his time, how he wants to compete in Tennessee and whether he wants to stay the course as an independent insurer.\n\nBuy Photo Dr. J.D. Hickey says he\u2019s still getting his arms around his new post as CEO of BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee. (Photo: Kathleen Greeson / For The Tennessean)\n\nYou've been in the top job about six weeks. What's your day to day?\n\nI\u2019m still getting my arms around it, to be clear. I try to focus my attention on the four to five things that I can most be impactful for. A big one of those is team building and team dynamics. I\u2019m a fairly big believer that it takes deliberate day-to-day energy to create a sort of connected, coordinated team that is functioning at a high level.\n\nIt's no surprise. Any CEO gets pulled into the biggest priorities of their team, and a whole bunch of my time is spent in and around the individual market right now. That\u2019s a market that is still very much in flux as seen by the (Community Health Alliance) news. It\u2019s frankly changing so fast that a fair amount of my time and energy goes there.\n\nThere could be about 600,000 Tennesseans eligible to buy plans on the exchange, which is now in its third open enrollment, particularly with the ending of BCBST's grandfathered and grandmothered plans. What are you thinking about this enrollment season?\n\nThis is a market we\u2019re deeply committed to making work. I think we\u2019ve got the broadest presence. We went in early, we went in all the counties. We tried to cover all the metallic levels. Anybody that has been anywhere near this market over the (past) few years realizes it has not been smooth. I think the combination of legal, political, operational challenges has been quite severe, and all you\u2019ve got to do is spend a few hours on one of our call lines \u2014 it\u2019s still difficult.\n\nPeople call in with something that should be straightforward like changing a wrong date of birth \u2014 something that would take literally less than five minutes on any of our other products \u2014 (and it) will require multiple calls both to us and the federal call center and a couple of hours to change. It\u2019s a new program. We\u2019re still front and center, and a bunch of changes can only be made by federal call centers. It makes our average call centers' time and stats on the marketplace lines fundamentally longer and more challenging than the rest of our business.\n\nAt the same time it\u2019s getting better. People are getting more familiar with the products.\n\nA whole lot of choice is now left to the individual, which I think is increasingly the way health care decisions are going to be made. It does put the onus on individuals to make sure they get educated.\n\nThere are still challenges, and I hear about them from readers. I'm curious about reputation \u2014 there's a saying in the power utility industry that you can spend 10 years building a solid reputation, but it only takes one hurricane to wash it away. It strikes me that health insurers are in a similar position, and now customers can shop around.\n\nYou\u2019re putting your finger on one of the things we struggle with every day, on an hourly basis. On a macro level, we view ourselves as playing a key role in helping keep cost control, or medical inflation, under control, or to at least a manageable level. At the same time, how do you manage that against making sure people have access to the care that they need? Those will be difficult. You only make those decisions when you feel like you can still put an attractive product out into the market that has great alternatives in the same community that has, at least, good, if not better, outcomes and cost profiles.\n\nBut no, that\u2019s tough. That\u2019s absolutely tough. ... What you see here is, increasingly, individuals want more access to control, their own health experience and expenditures. A whole lot of our investments are in things like consumer tools to try to increase the transparency both from quality and cost perspective to help individuals try to make healthy choices.\n\nWhat opportunities are you looking at?\n\nMaybe not all of our customers are aware that we are fundamentally changing the way we reimburse providers for care \u2026 in Medicare Advantage, where we made a big strategic push three years ago. We\u2019ve been very pleased with the growth of that program. We\u2019ve grown faster than each of our competitors combined over the last two years. Every physician is reimbursed to quality outcomes and overall cost management. Within 18 months, hopefully that will be true of 100 percent of our commercial physician network as well.\n\nWhat comes with that, interestingly, when I think about our MissionPoint Health Partners partnership in Middle Tennessee, our Aspire Health partnership, also in Middle Tennessee, is when we reimburse care differently, the care setting tends to change. More and more of that care sort of migrates out of the institutionalized setting and out of our call center and is increasingly happening, sort of touchpoints are broadening to include technological ones, digital ones or in peoples' homes.\n\nThere are big ways care is changing in the background that we\u2019re not just a part of, but we\u2019re a big driver of here in Tennessee.\n\nIs it going to stay independent, or is it going to go the way of many other insurers and be a party in a merger?\n\nThere is a long, proud history of being a high-performing, single-state Blues plan (that is a) mission driven, tax paying not-for-profit.\n\nWe\u2019ve also been one of the highest-growing and some of the most positive margins in the system as well. We\u2019re not just doing well, but we\u2019ve been doing even better over the last few years. That\u2019s in the face of what we would acknowledge as increasingly formidable competition.\n\nI, personally, am very much wedded to our independence as a Blues plan. We are all about Tennessee. I think one of the things I bring to the role is a deep appreciation for what our employees can do. We have been part of some really big successes since I've been here, and if I think about going head to head against any of our growing competition, even though some of them are literally 10-times larger than us, I\u2019d stack our team up against any of them.\n\nI\u2019d put our employee base and our model up against anybody out there. I think we\u2019re very much proud of what we have. We attribute a whole lot of that to the fact that we\u2019re local and independent. We plan to stay that way.\n\nReach Holly Fletcher at 615-259-8287 or on Twitter @hollyfletcher.\n\nDr. J.D.
