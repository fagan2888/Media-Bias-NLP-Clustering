Then it was off to Tampa Bay Christian Academy, where it\u2019s his job as maintenance director to open the school every morning at 6 a.m.\n\nAt midday, he broke routine. And the day became like none other.\n\nHe went home and changed from his jeans to his best gray suit. With his wife and two daughters, he headed to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services field office on Hoover Street in Tampa.\n\nOn this day, he would realize his dream and become a citizen of the country that gave him asylum when he arrived in November 2007.\n\nLazaro claimed a seat on the front row in the crowded room, nervous and excited at the same time. The minutes seemed like an eternity. After he and his 49 fellow immigrants received their instructions from the judge, the glass doors opened and the guests poured in.\n\nHe saw school headmaster Natasha Sherwood first and waved. She had told him she would be there. And then came what he didn\u2019t expect: student after student from the academy filing in, carrying homemade banners, flags and signs for their beloved Lazaro. They wanted to witness this monumental occasion.\n\nHe tried to compose himself, but to no avail. His eyes welled up \u2014 \u201cI cry as easily as I smile,\u201d he says \u2014 and he stood a little taller. It was perfect now. He was surrounded by the love of staff and students who adopted him as their own when he first came to the school five years ago.\n\n\u201cThey are my family, too,\u201d a beaming Lazaro, 49, says through an interpreter. \u201cWhat they did for me was my biggest surprise of my life.\u201d\n\n***\n\nGrowing up with his two sisters and parents in central Cuba, Lazaro always felt there was a target on his back.\n\nHis father, once a prosperous cattle farmer, spent three years in prison. His crime was speaking out against President Fidel Castro. His mother spent time in jail, too, though she was allowed to bring 1-year-old Lazaro with her.\n\nHe was raised with hope and whispers: hope for a better day for their country, and whispers when they spoke about it, frightened of retaliation. Lazaro eventually married his sweetheart, Marivel, went to college for his bachelor\u2019s degree and got a job teaching machinery construction. He earned $11 a month.\n\nThough his wife worked as an accountant, they could barely make ends meet. To save money, Lazaro built a third floor on top of his parents\u2019 home where they could live.\n\nThe couple worried about what kind of future their two young daughters had in a communist country led by a dictator.\n\nHis father would assure him: One day Castro will be gone. But that day never came.\n\nIn what would be the most difficult decision of his life, Lazaro applied for asylum in the United States. With his father\u2019s history, he had a good case for not feeling safe in Cuba.\n\nWhen his employers learned of it, they fired him. And when he broke the news to his parents, they cried.\n\n\u201cThey understood, but they were so sad about it,\u201d he says.\n\nCuban parolees must provide an affidavit of support to show they will not be the responsibility of the U.S. government when they arrive. Lazaro\u2019s family was hosted by his father\u2019s longtime friends, Waldo and Adela Yanes, who came to Tampa decades ago to escape Castro\u2019s rule.\n\nThey arrived Nov. 29, 2007, with no money and just the clothes on their backs. They didn\u2019t speak English. The children \u2014 Rachel, 11, and Raxay, 5 \u2014 started picking up the language right away in school. It was harder for Lazaro and Marivel, who needed to find jobs. Because they were political refugees, officials expedited their documentation, allowing them to work legally.\n\nWith the help of their family friends, Lazaro got a job in a factory making juice and milk cartons, and Marivel found janitorial work at a nearby Christian school. A few months later, Lazaro joined her there.\n\nShe eventually left and got training as a certified nursing assistant and now works for three agencies. Lazaro felt comfortable at Tampa Bay Christian Academy and stayed put.\n\nThe feeling was mutual.\n\n\u201cThe word \u2018no\u2019 is not in his vocabulary,\u201d says Selma Grantham, a guidance counselor and the high school principal. \u201cWhatever you ask him to do, he responds with \u2018I\u2019ll take care of it.\u2019 And you know he will follow through.\u201d\n\nJust like he\u2019s the first person to arrive at the school in the morning, he\u2019s the last person there to lock up at 6 p.m. He has a fancy title, but he\u2019s a staff of one. His hourly wage of just less than $11 an hour is a princely sum compared to his Cuban earnings.\n\n\u201cOn days he isn\u2019t here,\u201d says student Amy Rotondi, 17, \u201cyou don\u2019t know who to ask for help. He does it all.\u201d\n\nHe cleans up lunchroom messes, fixes overflowing toilets, cuts the grass, repairs broken air-conditioning units and helps with the \u201ccar line\u201d at the start and end of the school day. He moves purposefully from one building to the next, staying focused on tasks from an always-filled punch list. Still, he makes time for a gregarious \u201cHello!\u201d and a big smile to every student and teacher he passes by.\n\n\u201cHe is never without that smile. He\u2019s just such a good person with a good heart,\u201d Grantham says. \u201cWe have a saying in Spanish \u2014 \u2018Alma de dios.\u2019 It means soul of God. Lazaro is our soul of God.\u201d\n\n***\n\nFor all of Lazaro\u2019s contributions to Tampa Bay Christian Academy, and there have been plenty, none stands out more than the Big Move this past summer.\n\nThat\u2019s when he was declared their savior.\n\nIt started last April, when the academy, home to 217 students, kindergarten through high school, got some jolting news.\n\nAfter 57 years in one location, it would have to vacate the property it shared with Christ Fellowship Church because the church had decided it no longer wanted a school.\n\nMichael Miller, pastor of North Rome Baptist Church and a 1999 graduate of the academy, heard of his former school\u2019s dilemma. With the blessings of his small congregation of 30, he made the offer: Let us be your new home.\n\nIt was a perfect fit. Best of all, it was only six blocks away.\n\nThey had a daunting task before them. With just two months to go before school started, parents and staff volunteered long hours to help with the move. And leading the way was Lazaro.\n\nHiring a moving company was not in the budget. So every day, he packed up dozens of boxes filled with books, computers, furniture and supplies, loading them into his \u201998 Chevy truck with 278,000 miles on it and transporting them to the new location.\n\nIf it wasn\u2019t sweltering hot, it was raining buckets. But he worked through it all: trimming hedges, building walls, fixing desks, repairing roofs, pressure washing siding, laying carpet.\n\nHe was often heard singing under his breath. His upbeat mood was contagious, helping with everyone\u2019s frayed nerves.\n\n\u201cWithout him, we never could have made it. Lazaro made it happen,\u201d says Natasha Sherwood, the school\u2019s new headmaster.\n\n***\n\nIn just five years, Lazaro and Marivel have achieved more than they ever could have imagined.\n\nBy saving diligently and working long hours, they managed to buy their first home \u2014 a three-bedroom, one-bath block house on a corner lot in the Egypt Lake neighborhood. Their oldest daughter, Rachel, a senior at Hillsborough High, has a 5.7 grade-point average. She\u2019s gotten several scholarship offers and plans to attend the University of South Florida next fall, where she\u2019ll study medicine.\n\nYoungest daughter Raxay, 11, is smart, too, her proud father says.\n\nHe pulls out his wallet and shows off their school pictures. \u201cThey get their good looks from their father,\u201d he says, laughing.\n\nOf all the goals he had when he came to America \u2014 finding work, building credit, buying a home, making sure his girls were educated \u2014 only one remained unfulfilled.\n\nLazaro wanted to be an American.\n\n\u201cThis country opened its doors to me,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I want to honor it by becoming a citizen.\u201d\n\nSo in the midst of moving the school from one location to another, Lazaro began studying for the citizenship test \u2014 an exam that covers some 100 questions about American government, history and civics. He listened to English-language CDs in his truck, read his books and practiced writing on his lunch breaks, late evenings and weekends. His daughters worked alongside him, giving him verbal quizzes.\n\n\u201cMy dad is the most hard-working man I know,\u201d Rachel says. \u201cNo matter how complicated something is, he sticks with it until he solves the problem. He never gives up.\u201d\n\nHis determination had an impact on the students as well. Ten-year-old Michael Delrosario, who dreams of playing in the National Basketball Association one day, says Lazaro\u2019s success shows him \u201cyour dreams are never too big.\u201d And 8-year-old Imani Norris sums up their maintenance director in one word.\n\n\u201cAwesome,\u201d she says. \u201cHe\u2019s taught us to never stop working hard. And that you can never be too happy.\u201d\n\nLazaro speaks of Jan. 7, the day he became a naturalized citizen, with solemn reverence. Now doors are open to things that were denied to him in his country of birth. Lazaro rattles them off at rapid-fire speed: freedom of speech, a peaceful life, justice, endless opportunities for his children, who automatically will become citizens once the paperwork is approved.\n\nHe is anticipating the first election when he can cast his ballot \u2014 \u201cAn honor that humbles me,\u201d he says.\n\nAnd there are more goals. He tells his visitor to come back in five years, when he will be able to converse fluently in English.\n\nHe says he is thankful to be part of the school\u2019s tight-knit family, where he feels needed and loved. Never could he have imagined how much happiness he would find as a maintenance worker, even with his bachelor\u2019s degree and his former life as a white-collar professional.\n\nLazaro has been back to Cuba twice to visit family. He will always go back when he can.\n\nBut this is now home.\n\n\u201cAnything is possible,\u201d he says, smiling. \u201cAnything at all.\u201d\n\nmbearden@tampatrib.com\n\n(813) 259-7613", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sat, 25 Jan 2014 01:00:00 -0400", "Description": "TAMPA \u2014 Lazaro Escobio began the day like any other.", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "TAMPA \u2014 Lazaro Escobio began the day like any other.", "title": "Surrounded by love, immigrant gets citizenship", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/news/surrounded-by-love-immigrant-gets-citizenship-20140125/", "image": {"width": 3987, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140125/ARTICLE/140129494/EP/1/3/EP-140129494.jpg", "height": 2712}, "updated_time": "2014-01-25T08:52:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "TAMPA \u2014 Lazaro Escobio began the day like any other.", "title": "Surrounded by love, immigrant gets citizenship", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140125/ARTICLE/140129494/AR/0/AR-140129494.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2014-01-25T01:00:00Z-04", "modified_time": "2014-01-25T08:52:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd92ba\"", "article_summary": "He was surrounded by the love of staff and students who adopted him as their own when he first came to the school five years ago.\nTAMPA \u2014 Lazaro Escobio began the day like any other.\nWith just two months to go before school started, parents and staff volunteered long hours to help with the move.\nWith his wife and two daughters, he headed to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services field office on Hoover Street in Tampa.\nAnd then came what he didn\u2019t expect: student after student from the academy filing in, carrying homemade banners, flags and signs for their beloved Lazaro."}
