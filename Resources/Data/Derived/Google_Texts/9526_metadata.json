Bush\u2019s spokeswoman at the end of his presidency, is out with a book that is part memoir, part career advice. Perino is the only Republican woman ever to serve as White House press secretary and is now a co-cost of \u201cThe Five\u201d on Fox News Channel.\n\nFive tidbits from \u201cAnd the Good News Is \u2026: Lessons and Advice from the Bright Side,\u201d which goes on sale Tuesday:\n\nLIFTING VEIL ON WALTER REED\n\nPerino offers a behind-the-scenes look into some of a president\u2019s toughest moments \u2014 the emotional private meetings with critically wounded troops at Walter Reed military hospital. She writes that she worried that families sitting in bedside vigils would be angry with Bush for sending their loved ones to war, but usually they welcomed and thanked him. In her first visit, a Marine opened his eyes for the first time since being injured by a roadside bomb when the president awarded him the Purple Heart, leaving Bush and everyone else in the room in tears. The Marine died a few days later. She also writes of a mother who did not give Bush a warm welcome, but instead questioned why it was her child and not his who lay in the hospital bed. \u201cThat mama sure was mad at me,\u201d she quotes Bush as saying as they headed back to the White House, a tear running down his cheek. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t blame her a bit.\u201d\n\nA DEMOCRATIC FRIEND IN WASHINGTON\n\nDespite partisan differences, Perino writes that she\u2019s had a good relationship with President Barack Obama. The two met when they were seated across from each other at the Gridiron Club dinner in 2005 \u2014 when he was a new senator and she the new White House deputy press secretary. \u201cWe laughed our butts off for four hours,\u201d she wrote, adding that Obama also took her across the room to meet his wife. She next saw Obama three years later, when the Democratic presidential nominee came to a White House meeting on the financial crisis. She writes that he wrapped her in a hug in front of a roomful of people and told her the night they spent together was his favorite of all time in Washington. \u201cI really turned red \u2014 especially since I wasn\u2019t sure everyone else knew what he was talking about!\u201d she writes.\n\nPOLITICS \u2013 TO ENGAGE OR STAY OUT?\n\nPerino writes how every president coming on the end of eight years can expect to face criticism from candidates running to replace him. As Obama\u2019s team tries to figure out just how hard to push back, Perino writes of her concern about letting Bush get \u201cbruised and battered\u201d while she stayed out of the fray. She did so, on directions from the top and writes that even if Bush wanted her to be a counterattack dog, it\u2019s not her style. \u201cBut I wonder if things may have been different if once in a while I\u2019d bared some teeth,\u201d she writes. Perino did have a secret way of firing back when the briefing questioning got heated, underneath the podium. \u201cI\u2019d just rest my hand next to my water, out of view of anyone, keep a pleasant look on my face, and flip \u2019em the bird.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "5 things from former Bush press secretary Perino\u2019s book", "author": "Nedra Pickler", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "5 things from former Bush press secretary Perino\u2019s book", "title": "5 things from former Bush press secretary Perino\u2019s book", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/04/18/5_things_from_former_bush_press_secretary_perinos_book/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/george-bush-spokeswomans-book-5-things.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "5 things from former Bush press secretary Perino\u2019s book", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/george-bush-spokeswomans-book-5-things.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "title": "5 things from former Bush press secretary Perino\u2019s book", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "5 things from former Bush press secretary Perino\u2019s book", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Perino is the only Republican woman ever to serve as White House press secretary and is now a co-cost of \u201cThe Five\u201d on Fox News Channel.\nTopics: From the Wires, Entertainment News, NewsWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Dana Perino, President George W.
