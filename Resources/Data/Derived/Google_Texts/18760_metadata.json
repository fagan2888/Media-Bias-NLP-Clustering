The department hopes to have open enrollment in July, she said.\n\nDavidson was the keynote speaker at the Central Council for the Tlingit and Haida Indian Tribes of Alaska\u2019s annual Elders and Caregivers Workshop in Juneau. A Yup\u2019ik from Bethel, Davidson spoke to the group of elders and their caregivers about tackling the budget and Medicaid expansion with a rural Native perspective \u2014 she won\u2019t \u201cpropose solutions and ideas that will only work in a big community.\u201d\n\nLiving in a village, \u201cyou don\u2019t have a choice about being innovative, you have to do more with less,\u201d Davidson said. \u201cHow are we going to do things differently? ... We have to have people (in government) who know what it\u2019s like to grow up poor.\u201d\n\nDavidson\u2019s top priorities as commissioner are Medicaid expansion and child welfare. She said Gov. Bill Walker, who appointed Davidson the day he was sworn in, shares her vision for universal health care and is a \u201cthoughtful\u201d and \u201cpractical problem solver.\u201d\n\nWalker has asked his commissioners to identify cuts of 5 and 8 percent in their own budgets to help solve the state\u2019s financial problems, brought on by dropping crude oil prices that are hovering around $48 per barrel.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to come up any time soon,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s no way we\u2019re going to keep the programs we have. ... You should know cuts are coming; we can\u2019t avoid it.\u201d\n\nAlthough she \u201clikes a good puzzle,\u201d Davidson said \u201cit has been heartbreaking\u201d to go through her department\u2019s budget and identify line items that will take a hit. She said her department will probably be one that endures the higher 8 percent budget cut.\n\nWhile other departments can shrink their spending by putting off a capital project or two, cuts to DHSS have serious implications, Davidson said\n\n\u201cThe reality is in our department, when we make cuts, kids die, families don\u2019t eat and people go without health care,\u201d she said.\n\nDHSS operates on a $2.7 billion budget; $1.7 billion of that is spent on Medicaid. With the state\u2019s financial problems looming, the department will have to find ways to cut that cost, Davidson said.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t sustain that,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need Medicaid reform to do things differently\u201d and to determine ways to minimize the required state match and maximize the federal match.\n\nThrough the Affordable Care Act, the federal government has promised to pay 100 percent of expanded Medicaid costs to states that opt in during the calendar years 2014, 2015 and 2016. In 2017, 2018 and 2019, it will foot 93 to 95 percent of the bill. In 2020 and beyond, the federal government will pay for 90 percent of the costs.\n\nCreating tribal-state partnerships \u201ccan help to save many aspects of the Medicaid system,\u201d she said.\n\nSome ideas for Medicaid cost-saving include expanding the role of non-MD health care workers \u2014 health, dental and behavioral health aides and nurse practitioners \u2014 so more Alaskans can get medical help closer to home; and more commonly using telehealth services \u2014 essentially a Skype appointment with a health care provider.\n\nThere are plenty of Medicaid naysayers in the state \u2014 former Gov. Sean Parnell opted Alaska out of expansion of the federal health program during his time in office because of the cost \u2014 and that will only be exacerbated now that the state is in money trouble, Davidson said. But even so, she believes \u201cMedicaid is worth the expansion.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of people in this state that don\u2019t have any health coverage at all,\u201d Davidson said. \u201cWe really see Medicaid expansion as an investment in the health of Alaska. ... We want (people) to be healthy, we want them to be happy and we want them to live in good communities.\u201d\n\nDHSS spokeswoman Sarana Schell said while there are costs associated with Medicaid expansion, there are also opportunities for savings.\n\n\u201cMost people who are eligible for the state\u2019s Catastrophic and Chronic Illness Assistance program \u2014 for low-income Alaskans who have inadequate or no health insurance but who don\u2019t qualify for current Medicaid \u2014 would qualify for expanded Medicaid,\u201d she said.\n\nAccording to a study of the impact of Medicaid expansion in the state, completed by the Lewin Group for the Parnell administration in 2013, about 20,000 Alaskans are completely uninsured and not covered by the federal government\u2019s Indian Health Services. Expanding the program to cover those that fall in the gap at that time would have cost approximately $40 million over the 2014 to 2020 period, according to the study.\n\nA 2013 study by the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium, where Davidson worked previously, reports that 41,500 Alaskans fall into the coverage gap, including 15,700 Alaska Natives and Native Americans. It estimated that the state would have spent almost $91 million on expansion over the 2014 to 2020 period.\n\nDavidson said health care coverage of Alaskans age 45 to 64 would nearly double if Medicaid, which is based on income level and available to people under the age of 65, was expanded in the state.\n\nSchell said Medicaid coverage is important for Native people even if they are covered by IHS because not every community in the state has a Native health clinic. A Native person covered by Medicaid would be able to visit any doctor available for a medical emergency.\n\nThe state has encountered issues with its Medicaid enrollment system as well as its payment system. Doctors and other Medicaid health care providers need to be accurately and quickly paid by the state for expansion to be a success, Davidson said.\n\nShe hopes to get a Medicaid expansion page up on the DHSS website \u201cso people can track our progress.\u201d\n\nDavidson also spoke on issues uniquely affecting the Alaska Native community. She said that tribal-state relations have not been great in recent years, which she called \u201cthe understatement of the day.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want you to know that\u2019s coming to an end,\u201d she said to applause from the crowd. \u201cWe can\u2019t make progress like that.\u201d\n\nDavidson was received warmly by her audience, and said she chose to speak at the workshop despite a busy schedule because \u201cfamily always comes first.\u201d CCTHITA Tribal Family and Youth Services Director Francine Eddy Jones said it has \u201cbeen so fun to see (Davidson) grow professionally over the years\u201d \u2014 she started out as a student teacher at Harborview Elementary School in Juneau after completing her undergraduate studies at the University of Alaska Southeast.\n\nDavidson said the warm welcome is bittersweet \u2014 she worries about the public reaction once the governor\u2019s budget is released Feb. 18.\n\n\u201cI hope you still feel that way when the budget comes out,\u201d she said. \u201cThese are cuts that are unavoidable and I\u2019m going to be the one standing in front of that budget.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Contact reporter Katie Moritz at 523-2294 or at katherine.moritz@juneauempire.com.
