If a patient were on the table, the wire with an inflatable balloon hidden in the tip would be snaking through an artery.\n\nThe device is the first of its kind in an eight-state Rocky Mountain region and the eighth to be used in a hospital. It is one of only 15 now in use in the country after the Food and Drug Administration in November approved the device for cardiac interventions.\n\nValley View landed the nearly $500,000 device ahead of larger hospitals partly because of its small size.\n\nCorindus Vascular Robotics, the Waltham, Mass.- based maker of the robotic CorPath Vascular Robotic System, wanted to team up for research with a hospital that offers only interventional cardiac procedures. Interventional procedures include angioplasties and stent placements but not procedures that involve surgically opening a patient\u2019s chest. Valley View sends patients needing that kind of surgery on to larger hospitals.\n\nValley View also has a record of getting patients from the emergency room to the cardiac lab to begin procedures in 45 minutes or less \u2014 about half the national average. And it has two interventional cardiologists and a cardiologist on staff in its Heart & Vascular Center. The hospital and its cardiac staff were willing to be one of five hospitals around the country participating in ongoing cardiac research with Corindus.\n\n\u201cValley View was a very good fit for this technology,\u201d said Corindus president and CEO Dave Handler.\n\nValley View interventional cardiologist Dr. Frank Laws was also instrumental in bringing the angioplasty robotic device to Valley View. He came to the hospital in 2006 and had been keeping a close eye on the development of the robotic device. He was ready to use it when it became available.\n\n\u201cI like to go where no one has gone before,\u201d Laws said. \u201cThis is all new stuff.\u201d\n\nLaws said the robotic system brings numerous benefits to both cardiologists and patients.\n\nFor cardiologists tucked away in the cockpit, it means less exposure to radiation from the medium used to illuminate an artery.\n\nFor patients, Laws said he can be more precise robotically when moving through an artery and placing a stent to hold the artery open. He said he can often use one stent rather than the two he might have had to use without the robot. It is also done in less time.\n\nThose factors can cut the cost of the procedure by as much as 20 percent, he said.\n\nJim Bickling of Gypsum was the most recent patient to experience the benefit of a robotic angioplasty. Laws used the robot device to open one of Bickling\u2019s severely blocked arteries a week ago. Bickling is up and about and said he is feeling better than he did before the procedure.\n\n\u201cIt was so simple,\u201d he said, once he got through the frightening experience of being wheeled into a surgical room he likens to \u201ca space ship\u201d for a procedure that verged on science fiction for him.\n\nBesides doing continuing research on angioplasties utilizing the robotic system, Laws said Valley View will eventually be adding robotic electrophysiology.\n\nIn that procedure, multiple catheters are inserted into the heart to measure electrical signals.\n\nThe hospital also plans to offer training for physicians. That will be accommodated in a monitoring room off the surgical suite that is outfitted with multiple monitors. Those monitors also can be used for consultations. The cardiologists at Valley View can send images of a patient\u2019s artery to the University of Colorado while a procedure is underway.\n\nNancy Lofholm: 970-256-1957, nlofholm@denverpost.com or twitter.com/nlofholm", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Valley View Hospital in Glenwood Springs scores a robotic first", "title": "Valley View Hospital in Glenwood Springs scores a robotic first", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/02/22/valley-view-hospital-in-glenwood-springs-scores-a-robotic-first/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-22T18:40:30+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-02-22T18:40:30+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc0d4\"", "article_summary": "Valley View interventional cardiologist Dr. Frank Laws was also instrumental in bringing the angioplasty robotic device to Valley View.\nBesides doing continuing research on angioplasties utilizing the robotic system, Laws said Valley View will eventually be adding robotic electrophysiology.\n\u201cValley View was a very good fit for this technology,\u201d said Corindus president and CEO Dave Handler.\nValley View landed the nearly $500,000 device ahead of larger hospitals partly because of its small size.\nGLENWOOD SPRINGS \u2014 The plastic wire wriggling like a minuscule worm on an empty surgical table in Valley View Hospital\u2019s cardiac lab is no bigger than a bit of fishing line."}
