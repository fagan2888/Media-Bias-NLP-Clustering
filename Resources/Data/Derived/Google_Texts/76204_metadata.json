However, we have begun to engage on that fight \u2013 but not terribly well.\n\nLike other terrorist organizations, ISIS builds itself on an aspirational ideal \u2013 in this case, radical Islamist theology and ideology. That has been the case with other terrorist groups of the past too, such as the Muslim Brotherhood, Hezbollah, and Hamas in the Islamist realm. Before that, radical groups like the Weather Underground, Baader-Meinhof/Red Army Faction, and the Palestinian Liberation Front organized on more Marxist and secular ideologies and narratives. Fighting these groups required more than just a law-enforcement approach; it required winning hearts and minds to keep those groups on the outer fringes of political action.\n\nRelated: It\u2019s Time to Wag the Dog Against ISIS\n\nSimilarly, the great contest of the post-World War II era hinged just as much on the competition of ideas as it did on arms races and other military measures. The Cold War was all about one ideology definitively trumping another, as the actions of the Soviet sphere and the West made clear that \u201cpeaceful coexistence\u201d and d\u00e9tente were unsustainable. Even the Non-Aligned Movement, which has outlasted the Cold War itself, turned into a battleground for the ideological debate and fight between the two superpower-driven poles of economic and political thought.\n\nRecall for a moment how exactly the West prevailed in that ideological conflict. Ground wars took place in Korea, Vietnam, and Afghanistan, for instance, and military interventions in Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Granada -- almost all of which turned into headaches for all sides.\n\nExcept for a tense week in 1962 over missile installations in Cuba, though, that grand generational conflict didn\u2019t get resolved through acute military conflict between the main belligerents. Instead, the big victories came in space, in technological achievement, and in economic development \u2013 the lack of which doomed the Soviet Union to collapse in the late 1980s.\n\nAll through that time, both sides honed their propaganda craft, although neither would admit to that definition. The US had the Voice of America, Radio Free Europe aimed at the Iron Curtain countries, and an overwhelmingly influential cultural presence. The Soviets had academics and media strategies designed to undermine American/Western arguments for freedom. The Soviet efforts worked within the closed systems of their own satellites, but failed otherwise to win the hearts and minds necessary to produce enough converts to win the ideological battle.\n\nRelated: ISIS Invades Social Media and Gets Turned Back\n\nIn the generation that has passed since the Cold War, though, efforts to sell Western-style liberty and democracy have dropped significantly. The definitive triumph of free markets and multiparty democracy over the Soviet model convinced many that the tools of ideological debate were not just unnecessary, but perhaps a vestige of superpower imperialism\n\nVoice of America and Radio Free Europe (now rebranded to Radio Liberty) still operate but get little attention in the US, except to debate whether they effectively represent America\u2019s vision of liberty and justice. In July, VOA cut out a significant part of its broadcasts and stopped operating altogether on some shortwave frequencies.\n\nFor the last several years we have faced another kind of ideological foe, and now ISIS and other radical Islamist groups have found success in recruitment and fundraising through their own propaganda efforts. The US has belatedly responded through a State Department initiative to blunt the impact of ISIS propaganda on Westerners, most recently in its \u201cThink Again Turn Away\u201d Twitter and YouTube campaign, launched in December 2013.\n\nRelated: The New Price Tag for the U.S. War Against ISIS\n\nThe focus on ISIS atrocities and the near-slavery of women in their communities is offered as an antidote to the soft-sell approach of ISIS recruitment videos that have young people traveling to Syria and Iraq to join.\n\nUnfortunately, the State Department appears to be out of practice when it comes to ideological battles. Rita Katz, the director of SITE Intelligence Group, calls the effort \u201cembarrassing\u201d \u2013 and worse, counterproductive. In an essay for Time Magazine, Katz dresses down the State Department for wasting its time with one-on-one Twitter conversations that do exactly the opposite of what effective ideological debate should do \u2013 engage the fringe to make it mainstream.\n\nKatz notes that one such account, Amreeki Witness, was \u201cthrilled to be noticed by the U.S. Government.\u201d The direct engagement meant that the State Department essentially lent its platform to \u201claunch radical jihadist views toward Think Again Turn Away\u2019s thousands of followers.\u201d\n\nRelated: Obama Makes Some Dangerous Bets with ISIS Plan\n\nIt gets worse. An Australian leader within Jabhat al-Nusra, an al-Qaeda affiliate, celebrated the anniversary of 9/11 with a tweet noting that \u201cthe idol of capitalism\u201d had been destroyed \u201con this day, in 2001.\u201d The State Department responded to that by pointing out that ISIS \u201ccaliph\u201d Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi owns a Rolex. Katz reminds readers that the Nusra Front and ISIS are rivals, not allies, and that \u201cthe irony is ugly\u201d in engaging in dialogue with an AQ-affiliated terrorist leader on the anniversary of 9/11. That, Katz argues, \u201cprovide[s] legitimization to the account of the same people who committed the attacks.\u201d\n\nIn the political world, that practice is called \u201cpunching down.\u201d In the practice of ideological struggles of the past, it would be the equivalent of offering a podium to a Baader-Meinhof operative at a State Department briefing. Undoubtedly, the State Department will offer more rational arguments and win the debate, but the debate itself elevates the radical fringe to equality with the norm. It gives the ideological foes of rationality and humanitarian systems equal status \u2013 and that will only encourage more recruitment and more effective fundraising for ISIS and other terrorist networks.\n\nThe West needs to win the propaganda war against ISIS and other such groups, but we have to relearn the lessons of past age in doing so. Liberty and freedom will win the argument in the long run, but only if we ensure that our ideological framework keeps the dangerous fringe where it belongs, rather than legitimize them into the mainstream that they want to dominate. Silence is not an option, but neither should be handing our enemies megaphones.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Earlier this week, the editor of The Fiscal Times", "title": "The U.S. Is Fumbling the War of Ideas Against ISIS", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2014/09/18/US-Fumbling-War-Ideas-Against-ISIS", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/columns/09012014_ISIS.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2014/09/18/US-Fumbling-War-Ideas-Against-ISIS", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/columns/09012014_ISIS.jpg", "creator": "@EdMorrissey", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Earlier this week, the editor of The Fiscal Times", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "The West needs to win the propaganda war against ISIS and other such groups, but we have to relearn the lessons of past age in doing so.\nBefore that, radical groups like the Weather Underground, Baader-Meinhof/Red Army Faction, and the Palestinian Liberation Front organized on more Marxist and secular ideologies and narratives.\n\u201cIf we\u2019re fighting both an army and a war of ideas,\u201d she wrote, \u201cwe have to go after their ideas,\u201d urging the Department of Defense into action on that front.\nLike other terrorist organizations, ISIS builds itself on an aspirational ideal \u2013 in this case, radical Islamist theology and ideology.\nEarlier this week, the editor of The Fiscal Times wondered why the US had not engaged in the propaganda fight against ISIS."}
