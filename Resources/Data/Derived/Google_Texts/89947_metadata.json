But the income limit for working-age, able-bodied adults is about one-third of the federal poverty level, or $7,644 a year for a family of three.\n\nTo pay for that expansion, the federal law reduced a certain kind of Medicare reimbursement to hospitals, payments that compensated them for treating large numbers of uninsured individuals.\n\nSebelius said the idea behind that was that Medicaid expansion and other parts of the health reform law were supposed to greatly reduce the number of uninsured people, and therefore the hospitals would no longer need that subsidy.\n\nBut the U.S. Supreme Court later overturned the mandate that states expand their Medicaid programs, ruling instead that Medicaid expansion had to be an option for states. Since then, about 29 states have chosen to expand Medicaid; Kansas and Missouri have not.\n\nAs a result, hospitals like the one in Independence are receiving lower Medicare reimbursements. However, they are not seeing a reduction in the number of uninsured patients they treat, and they are not getting more Medicaid reimbursements.\n\nThe forum at UMKC came at a time when the debate over Medicaid expansion is heating up, especially in Kansas, where Democrats have recently vowed to make it a central issue in the 2016 elections and where a spokeswoman for Republican Gov. Sam Brownback recently called the idea \u201cmorally reprehensible.\u201d\n\nIn an email message to political supporters this week, Brownback\u2019s deputy communications director Melika Willoughby claimed that expanding Medicaid would divert health care resources away from the elderly and disabled, in favor of people who are less needy.\n\n\u201cMedicaid expansion creates new entitlements for able-bodied adults without dependents, prioritizing those who choose not to work before intellectually, developmentally and physically disabled, the frail and elderly, and those struggling with mental health issues,\u201d Willoughby wrote. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just bad policy, this is morally reprehensible.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just nuts,\u201d Sebelius said in response to that statement during a separate phone interview before Wednesday's panel discussion. \u201cI did see the statement, and it is just flat-out wrong.\n\n\u201cI think what the governor is probably talking about is that they have built an incredible waiting list because of budget shortfalls,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd to somehow suggest that this is the moral high ground, to leave people without health care is, to me, just an unbelievable argument to make.\u201d\n\nSince resigning as HHS Secretary in 2014, Sebelius has launched her own consulting firm that manages what she calls a \u201cportfolio\u201d of activities.\n\nShe serves on the boards of four different companies and does consulting work for a few others. She also does health policy analysis for the Aspen Institute.\n\nSebelius said she plans to be active supporting Democratic candidates in the 2016 elections but has not yet endorsed a presidential candidate.\n\nShe also emphatically ruled out the possibility of running for elected office anytime in the foreseeable future.\n\nCopyright 2016 The Lawrence Journal-World.
