"They may have significant savings if they will shop (for) their policies," Kiser said.

Utahns living in rural areas will see steeper rate increases than those in urban areas, Tanji Northrup, Utah's assistant insurance commissioner, told the lawmakers.

The rates are not yet final, but the Utah Insurance Department is recommending them to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HealthCare.gov) and to Avenue H.

The feds and Avenue H have until Oct. 30 to make final decisions on the rates.

Individuals can shop for 2015 insurance on HealthCare.gov starting Nov. 15. Enrollment via Avenue H is year-round.

Kiser said 900 plans were submitted to the Insurance Department for 2015, more than double the number for 2014.

But much of the growth simply reflects that the department is no longer allowing health plans to offer dental riders. Instead, insurance companies will offer plans with and without dental or pediatric dental coverage. The various permutations mean more plans to choose from.

Six companies will offer 108 plans to individual Utahns on the federal exchange, up from 96 this year. Such plans also have to be available off the exchange. Six companies, three of them new, are offering 148 plans exclusively off the exchange.

Small-business employees will have a plethora of options: 75 plans from three companies on Avenue H and 576 plans from seven companies off the exchange.

Rep. Jim Dunnigan, R-Taylorsville, said that increased number of plans will make it even harder for consumers shopping on the federal marketplace, healthcare.gov.

"You're going to have to scroll through a lot more pages," he said.
