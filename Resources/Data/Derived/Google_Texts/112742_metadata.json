Snowden. It is from the February 2013 edition of a monthly bulletin of SUSLOC, the acronym for the N.S.A. office that handles liaisons with Australian intelligence. It describes how Australian intelligence conducted surveillance of trade talks between Indonesia and the United States and, in the process, monitored communications between Indonesian officials and an American law firm retained by Indonesia for help with the trade dispute. The Australians then sought legal guidance from the N.S.A. (The document refers to the D.S.D \u2014 the Defense Signals Directorate \u2014 the former name of Australia\u2019s counterpart to the N.S.A. In May 2013, the agency was renamed the Australian Signals Directorate, or A.S.D.)\n\n(TS//SI//REL) SUSLOC Facilitates Sensitive DSD Reporting on Trade Talks: According to SIGINT information obtained by DSD, the Indonesian Government has employed a US law firm to represent its interests in trade talks with the US. On DSD\u2019s behalf, SUSLOC sought NSA OGC guidance regarding continued reporting on the Indonesian government communications, taking into account that information covered by attorney-client privilege may be included. OGC provided clear guidance and DSD has been able to continue to cover the talks, providing highly useful intelligence for interested US customers.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140215130606, "twitter": {"description": "An excerpt of a National Security Agency document describes how Australian intelligence conducted surveillance of trade talks between Indonesia and the United States.", "title": "Document Describes Eavesdropping on American Law Firm", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/16/us/document-describes-eavesdropping-on-american-law-firm.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002713474"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/16/us/document-describes-eavesdropping-on-american-law-firm.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002713474", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/16/us/document-describes-eavesdropping-on-american-law-firm.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Feb. 15, 2014", "edt": "The New York Times on the Web", "org": "Australian Signals Directorate", "keywords": "Surveillance of Citizens by Government,International Trade and World Market,National Security Agency,Snowden  Edward J,Indonesia,Australian Signals Directorate", "news_keywords": "Indonesia", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Snowden, Edward J", "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "An excerpt of a National Security Agency document describes how Australian intelligence conducted surveillance of trade talks between Indonesia and the United States.", "tom": "Text", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "description": "An excerpt of a National Security Agency document describes how Australian intelligence conducted surveillance of trade talks between Indonesia and the United States.", "CG": "us", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Feb. 15, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Text", "article": {"section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/national/index.html", "section": "U.S.", "modified": "2014-02-16", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "tag": "Australian Signals Directorate", "published": "2014-02-15", "section-taxonomy-id": "23FD6C8B-62D5-4CEA-A331-6C2A9A1223BE"}, "geo": "Indonesia", "slug": "16nsa-text", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140216172244, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/16/us/document-describes-eavesdropping-on-american-law-firm.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article", "description": "An excerpt of a National Security Agency document describes how Australian intelligence conducted surveillance of trade talks between Indonesia and the United States.", "title": "Document Describes Eavesdropping on American Law Firm"}, "pdate": 20140215, "des": "International Trade and World Market", "articleid": 100000002713474, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Document Describes Eavesdropping on American Law Firm", "col": "Text", "PST": "Text"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe16ad\"", "article_summary": "It describes how Australian intelligence conducted surveillance of trade talks between Indonesia and the United States and, in the process, monitored communications between Indonesian officials and an American law firm retained by Indonesia for help with the trade dispute.\n(TS//SI//REL) SUSLOC Facilitates Sensitive DSD Reporting on Trade Talks: According to SIGINT information obtained by DSD, the Indonesian Government has employed a US law firm to represent its interests in trade talks with the US.\noffice that handles liaisons with Australian intelligence.\nOn DSD\u2019s behalf, SUSLOC sought NSA OGC guidance regarding continued reporting on the Indonesian government communications, taking into account that information covered by attorney-client privilege may be included.\n(The document refers to the D.S.D \u2014 the Defense Signals Directorate \u2014 the former name of Australia\u2019s counterpart to the N.S.A."}
