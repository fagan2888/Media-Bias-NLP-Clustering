I think that it's detrimental, and ultimately destructive to so many of the foundations of civilization.\" On the issue of marriage equality Cameron remarked, \"Marriage was defined by God a long time ago. Marriage is almost as old as dirt, and it was defined in the garden between Adam and Eve -- one man, one woman for life till death do you part. So I would never attempt to try to redefine marriage. And I don't think anyone else should either. So do I support the idea of gay marriage? No, I don't.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "Following Arizona Gov.
