While healthcare spending has definitely fallen when looking back at the last 100 years in the United States, a new report by the Altarum Institue shows how that trend may be changing based on more recent comparisons.

In its Jan. 15 spending brief, Altarum researchers found that healthcare spending was up more than 5 percent in November 2014 when comparing to the prior year. In fact, healthcare spending as a percentage of gross domestic product was nearly 18 percent in October 2014, up from 16 percent in 2007 at the start of the Great Recession.

Here are 5 charts from the report that support their findings.
