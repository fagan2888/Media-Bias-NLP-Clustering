So dominant in the West, for example, that US vice president Joe Biden introduced the Recognizing Addiction as a Disease Act for debate in the US Senate on March 28, 2007.\n\nS. 1011: Recognizing Addiction as a Disease Act of 2007 (1) Addiction is a chronic, relapsing brain disease that is characterized by compulsive drug seeking and use, despite harmful consequences. It is considered a brain disease because drugs change the brain\u2019s structure and manner in which it functions. These brain changes can be long lasting, and can lead to the harmful behaviors seen in people who abuse drugs. The disease of addiction affects both brain and behavior, and scientists have identified many of the biological and environmental factors that contribute to the development and progression of the disease.\n\nYet the concept that addiction is a disease is certainly not new. In fact, it\u2019s been promoted and rebutted since the time of Aristotle (and other Greek and Egyptian scholars), and it has grown exponentially in authority and popularity since the early 1900s. This quote from a hundred years ago captures the flavour of the disease concept when it began to proliferate in the West:\n\nThe author considers it very unfortunate that the terms \u201cmorphine habit\u201d and \u201copium habit\u201d have been, and are still, so universally employed when referring to narcotic addiction (disease). They are misleading and do not, in any wise, accurately describe the condition present. . . . Habit implies something that can be corrected by an exercise of the will. . . . This is not true of narcotic disease; therefore, it is not a mere habit and should not be spoken of as such. . . . The man who is addicted to a narcotic drug is as truly a diseased man as one who has typhoid fever or pneumonia.\n\nHow did this definition arise, and how has it evolved in our own time?\n\nSociety\u2019s conceptualization of addiction has always reflected its policies for dealing with it. While Shakespeare referred to addiction in\u201dHenry V,\u201d nobody at the time advocated treatment centres for debauched nobility. Public alarm began to rise over \u201cdemon rum\u201d and other spirits early in the nineteenth century. By the end of that century, temperance movements vociferously demanded total abstinence. In the early twentieth century, alcoholics and addicts were seen as both doomed and damned if they could not or would not dry up. And when those warnings didn\u2019t work, Prohibition was launched in the United States as the next-best solution. Temperance activists saw alcohol itself as the cause of alcoholism, much like contemporary disease theorists see drugs (rather than environments) as the cause of drug addiction. When Prohibition was repealed to allow for social drinking, hard-core alcoholics were nevertheless reviled as morally depraved and undeserving of help.\n\nPublic policy thus maintained its moralistic and puritanical slant well into the 1930s. But then the view of medical practitioners, that addiction was a malady rather than a personal failing, picked up support from an unexpected source. Bill Wilson and Robert Smith started Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) in 1935, launching a new era in society\u2019s perception of addicts and their treatment. The premise of AA was that alcoholics were suffering human beings who had the right and the obligation to try to relieve their suffering. Through principles of mutual support, ongoing group attendance, self-honesty, and spiritual transformation, AA helped millions of alcoholics overcome their addictions, as it still does today. It also spearheaded society\u2019s recognition that addicts need help, not rejection, and that they can get better.\n\nThe founders of AA did not see addiction as a disease, exactly, but as a mental and spiritual \u201cmalady.\u201d Physical sensitivity to alcohol was initially conceived of as an \u201callergy,\u201d while the spiritual malady expressed itself in perpetual discomfort with life on life\u2019s terms, an inability to be at peace in the moment. Booze first seemed to soothe this discomfort but ultimately exacerbated the physical sensitivity. The result was a lifelong disorder that remained treatable, though never actually curable. AA counselled its members to stay vigilant about their vulnerability and to keep it firmly in mind by reciting metaphors, chanting slogans, and telling and retelling personal tales of failure and of success. A crucial springboard to sobriety was realizing that you were powerless over alcohol\u2014you were not capable of moderate or occasional drinking. The twelve steps of AA begin, still today, with an admission of powerlessness and a commitment to trust in a higher authority. It turns out not to matter as much anymore whether that authority is God, the group itself, your sponsor, or the medical community. What does matter is the acknowledgement of a serious deficit, which is\u2014not coincidentally\u2014the state you find yourself in when the doctor says you have cancer or pneumonia. That\u2019s when you know you need help.\n\nWhile AA\u2019s emphasis was on the mental and spiritual aspects of addiction, the idea of a biological sensitivity to alcohol opened the door to a more specific (and broadly accepted) definition of addiction as a disease. In the early 1950s, when Narcotics Anonymous (NA) and Hazelden\u2019s \u201cMinnesota Model\u201d got off the ground, the disease nomenclature began to flourish. NA, an outgrowth of AA, was established to treat those addicted to heroin and other drugs, and it was considered self-evident that the drug was what caused the disease of addiction. The Minnesota Model, which blended twelve-step philosophy with principles of residential care and education, became the gold standard for treatment centres by the 1960s. The Minnesota Model specifically labelled alcoholism a disease that overcame people physically, mentally, and spiritually. At the same time, an influential book by E. M. Jellinek, \u201cThe Disease Concept of Alcoholism,\u201d articulated a medical model that traced the progression of alcoholism through a series of phases leading to loss of control, insanity, and death. Now the \u201cdisease\u201d terminology began to appear in the literature of twelve-step programs throughout North America. And the American Medical Association classified alcoholism as an \u201cillness\u201d in 1967, making it official. In retrospect, the concept of a biological deficit, reified by AA, helped pave the way for the disease concept of addiction, and a medical term became standard parlance in the world of addiction treatment.\n\nToday the disease definition is used by twelve-step programs around the world, though its meaning continues to morph and vary from group to group. Moreover, twelve-step methods have become central in the world of institutional treatment, where the disease definition has been imported wholesale. There is a basic incompatibility between AA philosophy and the impersonal character of institutional care, and the disease label just reinforces the resulting fallout. Addicts seeking treatment, or those coerced into treatment by the justice system, are compelled to follow a recipe for recovery targeted to what is viewed as their disease, independent of their personal beliefs, which are often dismissed as irrelevant. If they do not follow the recipe, they may be denied any treatment at all, a policy that is fundamentally at odds with official twelve-step literature (though some twelve-step groups adopt the same punitive methods). For many addicts, this pressure tactic is a deal breaker, and that helps explain the acrimonious tone of the criticisms expressed by those who\u2019ve quit or been excluded from twelve-step-based care.\n\nThere are other ways in which twelve-step practice has helped erect barriers while attempting to relieve suffering. First, the AA framework and the medical notion of disease share the core assumption that addiction is a lifelong disorder and total abstinence is necessary to arrest it. The graded (e.g., occasional, social) use of any substance is deemed self-destructive, inevitably leading to relapse. This position often strikes former addicts as exaggerated and untenable, and epidemiological research shows that many recovered alcoholics are capable of social drinking. (The debate about moderation versus total abstinence is contentious and volatile, and I won\u2019t attempt to get into it here. Suffice it to say that many sources of evidence point to highly individualistic outcomes and resting points along the route to recovery. And whether or not total abstinence is necessary has little bearing on the disease concept, regardless.) Second, the collaboration between the twelve-step movement and institutional thinking asserts the need for treatment through recognized programs. This policy discourages addicts from finding their own way to recovery, and it blocks their access to benefits that might help pay for alternative resources. Moreover, it ignores compelling data, collected by a variety of independent organizations (most famously the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions, NESARC), showing that most addicts and alcoholics do recover, and that a majority of those\u2014up to three-quarters, depending on where you get your statistics\u2014recover without any treatment. Third, twelve-step literature maintains that the disease of addiction is built into one\u2019s character. Experts including Stanton Peele have shown how destructive this attribution can be, especially for young people whose identities are still under construction.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Defining addiction as a disease is marketing for the rehab industry \u2014 and an excuse when treatment doesn't work", "title": "Addiction is not a disease: How AA and 12-step programs erect barriers while attempting to relieve suffering", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Defining addiction as a disease is marketing for the rehab industry \u2014 and an excuse when treatment doesn't work", "title": "Addiction is not a disease: How AA and 12-step programs erect barriers while attempting to relieve suffering", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/07/11/addiction_is_not_a_disease_how_aa_and_12_step_programs_erect_barriers_while_attempting_to_relieve_suffering/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/coffee_maker_donuts.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Defining addiction as a disease is marketing for the rehab industry \u2014 and an excuse when treatment doesn't work", "title": "Addiction is not a disease: How AA and 12-step programs erect barriers while attempting to relieve suffering", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/coffee_maker_donuts.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Marc Lewis", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, addiction, Addiction is not a disease, Alcoholics Anonymous, Books, Disease, Editor's Picks, Marc Lewis", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0b9a\"", "article_summary": "And whether or not total abstinence is necessary has little bearing on the disease concept, regardless.)\nTopics: addiction, Addiction is not a disease, Alcoholics Anonymous, Books, Disease, Editor's Picks, Marc Lewis, Innovation News, Life NewsThe idea that addiction is some kind of disease is unquestionably the dominant view in government, medical, and most scientific circles around the world.\nThere are other ways in which twelve-step practice has helped erect barriers while attempting to relieve suffering.\nThe premise of AA was that alcoholics were suffering human beings who had the right and the obligation to try to relieve their suffering.\nIn retrospect, the concept of a biological deficit, reified by AA, helped pave the way for the disease concept of addiction, and a medical term became standard parlance in the world of addiction treatment."}
