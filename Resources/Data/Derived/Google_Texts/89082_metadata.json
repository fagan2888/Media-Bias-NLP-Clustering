David Ige\u2019s office said in a statement. The federal Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS) informed the exchange last week that federal funds were no longer available to support long-term operations.\n\n\u201cThe state is working with the Connector and CMS to determine what functions can be transitioned to state oversight to ensure compliance with the Affordable Care Act (ACA) by the next Open Enrollment in November 2015,\u201d Ige said.\n\nIge said that Hawaii will maintain a Supported State-based Marketplace in which the state would provide local customer support.\n\nGrant funds had been restricted in March after the exchange told officials it was not in compliance with the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as ObamaCare, due to fiscal instability and tech issues.\n\nThe shutdown comes after federal taxpayers dropped more than $200 million into the exchange, which critics called a waste of taxpayer money.\n\n\"The $200 million was a complete waste of tax dollars that could have been used for much more productive efforts,\" Reg Baker, a well-known CPA in Hawaii who for many years was the chief financial officer for the health insurance plan, HMAA, told FoxNews.com last month.\n\nWhile many of the state's Democrats praised the ObamaCare exchange when it launched in October 2013, it was riddled with trouble from the start. The web portal never worked properly despite the state spending $74 million on a contract with CGI to build and maintain it.\n\nThe exchange experienced tremendous staff turnover, with three executive directors appointed in two years. Enrollment reached just over 8,500 in the first year, and as a result, Hawaii was ranked the most costly exchange in the nation at more than $23,899 per person.\n\nEnrollment never reached the 300,000 number then-Gov. Neil Abercrombie, a Democrat, enthusiastically predicted at the opening press conference launching the Connector. The enrollment number also never hit 70,000, the minimum needed to stay financially solvent. At its peak, enrollment reached 37,000, a fraction of the state's 1.4 million people. Hawaii's uninsured population, at 8 percent when the exchange opened, dropped just 2 percent.\n\n\u201cThe state remains committed to offering health care coverage through the Prepaid Health Care Act as it has for the past 40 years,\u201d Ige said Friday. \u201cThe state continues to provide millions of dollars to serve 300,000 Hawaii adults and children who receive health care coverage through Medicaid.\u201d\n\nHawaii is not the only ObamaCare exchange to be plagued by troubles. Despite the government investing $4.5 billion into state-run exchanges, Oregon, Massachusetts, Maryland, Vermont, New Mexico and Nevada have also shut down their operations.\n\nFoxNews.com's Malia
