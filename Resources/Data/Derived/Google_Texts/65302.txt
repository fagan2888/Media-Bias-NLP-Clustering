Surf, sand, and sun are three things most Panama City Beach locals enjoy, but for one group, it meant a little bit more.

For many, Saturday was their first time on a surf board, others were veterans out on the waves. But they all had one thing in common, they have autism.

"It kind of grew from Christopher and I in the water to inviting friends out and we kind of saw that there was such a need to get these kids out of their house," said Autism Surfs Founder Ricky Weeks.

"Just knowing what he's started to help with that bond with his son has opened up something for a lot of parents," said parent Lauren Hammonds.

Hammonds said getting out on the water with her daughter Chloe opens up so many opportunities, not only learning to surf, but meeting kids just like her.

"Let these kids be together, but also bring other kids that are neurotypical to where they can learn about what these kids have and to see that they're just like them, it just takes them a little bit longer to learn things," said Hammonds.

It's a collective effort said Weeks. "It wouldn't work without these brave parents to get up and bring their kids to the beach, these amazing kids, a lot of these kids have never been in the Gulf of Mexico," said Weeks.

Parents said the volunteers out in the water are reasons they keep coming back.

"One of the guys that took him out last time saw him gave him a high five, to let him know hey I'm glad to see you again, you know where else would you get someone who cares like that," said parent Kenner Todd.

Parents said nothing can top seeing their children overcome a challenge.

"That elation as his arms were out as he was gliding in, you can't top that," said Todd.

Weeks also hopes to create a surfing summer camp for kids with autism.
