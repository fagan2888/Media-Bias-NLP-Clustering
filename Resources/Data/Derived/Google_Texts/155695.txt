A number of pharmaceutical distributors and health-care information technology companies got a lift Thursday when Deutsche Bank initiated coverage on a number of firms in both sectors, many of which it rated as “buy.”

McKesson Corp. /quotes/zigman/247413/delayed /quotes/nls/mck MCK , Walgreen Co. /quotes/zigman/245520/delayed /quotes/nls/wag WAG , Cerner Corp. /quotes/zigman/69765/delayed /quotes/nls/cern CERN and AthenaHealth Inc. /quotes/zigman/107872/delayed /quotes/nls/athn ATHN were the beneficiaries of Deutsche Bank analyst George Hill’s praise, and all shares climbed in early action.

The biggest climber was AthenaHealth, which jumped more than 4% to $131.13, up $5.40 a share. Hill recommended the stock along with Cerner and Allscripts Healthcare Solutions Inc. /quotes/zigman/85021/delayed /quotes/nls/mdrx MDRX , which gained more than 3% to $14.72. Cerner was up more than 2% to $57.20.

“We believe successful [health-care info tech] vendors will enable the transformation of the healthcare industry to a more dynamic value oriented environment from its legacy fee-for-service structure,” Hill said. “The leading vendors in the [health-care info tech] space could have a decade or more of above market revenue and comfortable double digit earnings growth rates ahead of them.”

Although McKesson plays in the health-care info tech space, the lion’s share of its revenue comes from pharmaceutical distribution. It’s there that Hill sees a sector transforming into a global model from a regional strategy.

“This scale matters most in several areas, with generic procurement being the most important. This will prove to be a scale business, where the high quality, low cost providers of service on at the largest scale will be best positioned to benefit,” he wrote in a note to clients.

Hill’s top picks were McKesson and Walgreen, though he did give a buy rating to Rite Aid Corp. /quotes/zigman/239690/delayed /quotes/nls/rad RAD McKesson added more than 1% to $160.63, Walgreen was up a similar percentage to $60.28 and Rite Aid was up nearly 3% to $5.24.
