He turned to Japanese Prime Minister Abe Shinzo, who joined him for the press conference on U.S.-Japan relations and trade, saying, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mr. Prime Minister, but this is a pretty important issue for us.\u201d\n\nRiots erupted Monday following the funeral of Freddie Gray, 25, who died on April 19 after suffering spinal-cord injuries while in police custody.\n\nThe Baltimore Police Department said fifteen officers were injured in the violence.\n\n\u201cMy thoughts are with the police officers who were injured in last night\u2019s disturbances,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThere\u2019s no excuse for the kind of violence we saw yesterday.\u201d\n\nU.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch, who was sworn in on Monday, dispatched the Justice Department\u2019s top civil rights official and the director of its community policing program to Baltimore. The department\u2019s civil-rights division and the FBI are investigating what she called \u201cthe tragic death of Mr. Gray.\u201d\n\nImproving Relations\n\nFollowing the deaths of two black men at the hands of police in separate instances in Ferguson, Missouri, and Staten Island, New York, Obama ordered a presidential task force to examine how to improve relations between community and police.\n\nLast month, Obama said his administration would act on the panel\u2019s recommendations, which included a call for greater oversight of police departments and the use of independent prosecutors to investigate deadly use of force by officers. The 11-member group also urged state and local police departments to change how officers view the communities they patrol and collect and publicize demographic information and about who they stop.\n\nAs late as Monday, Obama\u2019s spokesman said that the onus is on local law enforcement to confront tensions between police and minority communities.\n\n\u201cUltimately, this is a problem that the federal government is not going to be able to solve,\u201d White House press secretary Josh Earnest said.\n\nBut Obama said Tuesday that the conflict won\u2019t be solved simply by repairing the relationships between police and citizens. The country, he said, can\u2019t send officers \u201cto do the dirty work of containing the problems\u201d that arise in impoverished communities.\n\nUnless society does the work needed to change and lift up those communities, \u201cwe\u2019ll go through the same cycles of periodic conflicts between the police and communities and the occasional riots in the streets.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Mike Dorning and Justin Sink", "description": "The president says\u00a0police departments must rebuild trust in their communities.", "parsely-section": "politics", "parsely-image-url": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iKVyh7B_fcj8/v2/-1x-1.jpg", "og": {"site_name": "Bloomberg.com/politics", "description": "The president says\u00a0police departments must rebuild trust in their communities.", "title": "Baltimore Riot Spurs Obama Call for National Soul Searching", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-04-28/baltimore-violence-overshadows-legitimate-grievances-obama-says", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iKVyh7B_fcj8/v2/-1x-1.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"description": "The president says\u00a0police departments must rebuild trust in their communities.", "title": "Baltimore Riot Spurs Obama Call for National Soul Searching", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-04-28/baltimore-violence-overshadows-legitimate-grievances-obama-says", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iKVyh7B_fcj8/v2/-1x-1.jpg", "site": "@bpolitics", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"status": "The president says\u00a0police departments must rebuild trust in their communities."}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "parsely-title": "Baltimore Riot Spurs Obama Call for National Soul Searching", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "parsely-post-id": "NNIUN46S972X01", "parsely-author": "Mike Dorning and Justin Sink", "date": "2015-04-28T16:58:00.093Z", "keywords": "White House,Barack H Obama", "parsely-type": "post", "news_keywords": "White House,Barack H Obama", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-04-28T16:58:00.093Z", "parsely-tags": "White House,Barack H Obama,Region: Global,Page: article", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-04-28/baltimore-violence-overshadows-legitimate-grievances-obama-says"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7efb\"", "article_summary": "President Barack Obama called for a \u201csoul-searching\u201d national examination of the consequences of endemic poverty in minority communities in the aftermath of rioting in Baltimore.\n\u201cMy thoughts are with the police officers who were injured in last night\u2019s disturbances,\u201d Obama said.\nThe Baltimore Police Department said fifteen officers were injured in the violence.\nBut Obama said Tuesday that the conflict won\u2019t be solved simply by repairing the relationships between police and citizens.\nThe country, he said, can\u2019t send officers \u201cto do the dirty work of containing the problems\u201d that arise in impoverished communities."}
