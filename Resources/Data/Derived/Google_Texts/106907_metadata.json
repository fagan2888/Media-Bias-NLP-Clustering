They claimed that the report didn\u2019t necessarily signal big potential for fraud or abuse.\n\nRepresentative Sander Levin (D., Mich.) said: \u201cThere would be no financial windfall, as any government subsidy goes directly to insurance companies and not to the consumer seeking that insurance. In fact, people committing these frauds would be risking severe fines and possibly jail time.\u201d And Representative Joseph Crawley, (D., N.Y.) called the report \u201cmuch ado about nothing,\u201d adding: \u201cWhat is the ultimate prize for the criminal? Is it a free colonoscopy?\u201d\n\nInsurance companies would indeed receive subsidies when applications are falsified, but that doesn\u2019t mean the GAO\u2019s findings don\u2019t suggest numerous opportunities for fraud and abuse. National Review Online reached out to experts on health-care fraud, who described several ways bad actors could game the system and profit.\n\n\u201cAny time there is a government program where government money is flowing to someone or something, it can present opportunities for people and entities to abuse it and seek more than they are entitled to,\u201d says Wendy Weiss, the former chief of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office Civil Fraud Section.\n\nWeiss, who now serves as managing director for the Healthcare and Life Sciences, Disputes, Compliance, and Investigations practice at Navigant, a global consulting firm, says that even though \u201cthis is just an example of the GAO poking the system to see if it\u2019s working, basically doing a sting operation,\u201d to assess the potential for fraud, \u201cyou have to follow the flow of money to see who is most likely to benefit in order to determine where the potential for fraud lies.\u201d\n\nRebecca Busch, an expert on health-care fraud and the CEO of the Illinois-based auditing and forensic-services firm Medical Business Associates, offered several scenarios in which fraudsters could gain from creating a falsified identity for health coverage.\n\nFor example, individuals may create fake identities to access more health coverage than their plans cover, Busch says. \u201cPeople get confused on \u2018coverage for all,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s a whole category of essential health benefits. These are the things that everyone gets \u2014 but it\u2019s not a blank check. You only get so much per year.\u201d\n\nAs an example, Busch cited a real-life example in which one state\u2019s Medicaid rules covered only four prescriptions a month. \u201cBut Mom needs five,\u201d she says, \u201cso how do we do that?\u201d Officials learned that people were obtaining additional prescriptions using the identity of a family member. Similar schemes may also occur under Obamacare, she says.\n\nOthers, including immigrants who are not legally residing in the United States, may sign up using falsified data to gain coverage they\u2019re not entitled to, Busch says.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just individual consumers who might seek to defraud the system by using falsified information. Busch described a hypothetical small-town pharmacist who creates several false identities, signs them up for health coverage, and then gets prescriptions for narcotics issued to them. He then bills the government for the drugs (profit No. 1) and resells them on the street (profit No. 2). A benefit-plan sponsor could engage in a similar scheme, Busch says, billing the government for services rendered to falsified Obamacare \u201cenrollees.\u201d\n\nThe GAO\u2019s findings, though shocking, are only preliminary; a more comprehensive report will probably be released next year. But this news follows another report by the same agency suggesting that HealthCare.gov failed to catch significant inconsistencies for current enrollees.
