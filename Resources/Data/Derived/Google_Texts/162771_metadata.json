Sure, it would be the first time I\u2019ve ever done that when reading this magazine of \u201cconservative thought,\u201d which really started off as a repository for whatever racist swill William F. Buckley pulled out of the dark corners of his mind, where leering black men in berets and leather gloves endlessly lurked. It was an inauspicious beginning that has not gotten better with age. And sure, National Review\u2019s laughably bad writing has inspired so many other pretenders to the right-wing media\u2019s scholarly throne that the very words \u201cconservative intellectual\u201d long ago graduated to a \u201cjumbo shrimp\u201d level of oxymoron.\n\nBut still. Conservatism is a political philosophy with its own tenets. Donald Trump clearly doesn\u2019t care about any of them, which must appall anyone who still deludes themselves that they are rational believers in the project, free of the emotion and paranoia and self-pitying victimhood that fuel the modern conservative movement \u2014 a description that covers nearly every NR writer. If conservatism is to have any future as a governing principle, if it is to be anything other than irrelevant in America, surely someone somewhere on the right would take seriously the project of reclaiming it from the Breitbarts and Federalists of the world, of polishing this blackened diamond until it gleams again.\n\nMy open-mindedness lasted just long enough to read the list of contributors.\n\nIt would be bad enough if NR had used its own staff for this exercise. Lord knows what hilariously bad arguments Jonah Goldberg of \u201cLiberal Fascism\u201d fame would have brought to bear. But good Lord \u2018n\u2019 butter, Glenn Beck? Katie Pavlich? Dana Loesch, a woman famous for suggesting it was okay for American soldiers to drop their pants and piss on their dead enemies? Erick Erickson, whose most lasting contribution to political culture was to introduce the phrase \u201cgoat-fucking child molester\u201d to the lexicon?\n\nWilliam F. Buckley was a terrible human being in a million ways, but seeing these names among NR\u2019s contributors would have him spinning so fast in his grave he might actually tunnel out of it.\n\nStill, a promise is a promise. Let\u2019s look at Erickson running down a list of Trump\u2019s apostasies against conservatism:\n\nHe supported the prosecution of hate crimes\u2026 On all these things, Donald Trump now says he has changed his mind.\n\nTrump once thought hate crimes should be prosecuted, and to Erick Erickson, this is a negative. Let\u2019s move along. How about Mark Helprin. Here\u2019s his opening sentence:\n\nA diet, caffeine-free Marxist (really, the only thing wrong with being a Marxist is being a Marxist); a driven, leftist crook; and an explosive, know-nothing demagogue \u2014 all are competing to see who can be even more like Mussolini than is Obama.\n\nHow many jars of paste do you have to have eaten for lunch to suggest Bernie Sanders is both a Marxist and a fascist within the same sentence? Forget Helprin. Though I should note that elsewhere, Thomas Sowell makes an implicit comparison of Obama to Hitler. Unfortunately no one thought to compare our current president to Emperor Hirohito, thus missing out on hitting the rare trifecta of Axis-leader references.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The National Review wants conservatives to know that Trump is bad news.
