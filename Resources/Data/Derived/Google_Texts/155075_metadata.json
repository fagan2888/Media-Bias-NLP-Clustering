Credit: Rick Wood\n\nBy of the\n\nPittsburgh \u2014 One of the more unusual sights from the opening week of training camp was the disappointing play of receiver Jeff Janis, whose hands seemed to harden and whose targets seemed to diminish.\n\nBut after a few deep breaths, and more than a few reminders to slow himself down, Janis responded with a lengthy touchdown catch in the first exhibition game against New England and improved practice performances since.\n\nOn Sunday he turned in his second consecutive improved performance with three catches for 25 yards against the Steelers. Only tight end Richard Rodgers (three catches, 30 yards) turned in a better statistical afternoon, though Janis caught fewer than 50% of the seven passes thrown his way. He also had one drop and failed to drag both feet in bounds on a pass along the right sideline.\n\n\"Just working my stems, working my routes more, showing that I actually can get open because they see that on film, too,\" Janis said. \"That's considered a win, too, if you get open.\"\n\nJanis also received an opportunity to return punts in the No. 2 spot behind rookie Ty Montgomery, and this is where strangeness seeped in. Though he waved for a fair catch midway through the second quarter, Janis was popped by defensive back Brandon Boykin, who was promptly flagged for catch interference.\n\n\"I just fair caught it and thought the play was over,\" Janis said with a smile. \"Then all of a sudden I got hit.\"\n\nLater, in the third quarter, Janis allowed a punt to go right through his hands and nearly cost his team a touchdown. But replays showed the ball never touched him; Janis was off the hook.\n\n\"The ball just had this weird spin on it,\" Janis said. \"I thought it was coming right down, and then the last 10 feet of it, it took a hard curve. I tried to go for it, and fortunately I didn't touch it. Not even a little bit. Got lucky.\"\n\nStrong start: Rookie cornerback Damarious Randall made his professional debut Sunday after missing the first exhibition game with a groin injury, a problem that sidelined him on more than one occasion during training camp.\n\nRandall earned the No. 3 cornerback spot on the depth chart against the Steelers, trailing only Sam Shields and Casey Hayward, the two starters on the perimeter. When the Packers' first-round draft pick entered the game in the first quarter, Hayward moved inside to his familiar slot position.\n\n\"It was a lot, lot more than what I expected just with the energy of the game and with the pace of the game and stuff,\" Randall said. \"I just feel like everything went well.\"\n\nThe highlight of his day came on the first play from scrimmage in the third quarter, at which point quarterback Landry Jones was in the game. Randall found himself matched with Martavis Bryant, a 6-foot-4 receiver who splashed as a rookie last season with 549 yards and eight touchdowns, and Jones lofted a ball deep down the right side.\n\nBut Jones' pass was underthrown, and Randall, who missed a portion of the game with cramps, timed his leap perfectly to snare the ball away from Bryant for his first-career interception.\n\n\"It was just ecstatic and just very, very exciting,\" said Randall, grinning. \"Once I saw the ball \u2014 because I knew the receiver was (tall) \u2014 so I was like, 'I need to go up and get this ball.'\"\n\nOn the spot: While the injury to receiver Jordy Nelson made headlines in Wisconsin, the Steelers suffered a significant setback of their own. Starting center Maurkice Pouncey suffered an ankle injury that will likely require surgery, according to coach Mike Tomlin, and his absence may have contributed to a key fumble.\n\nBackup quarterback Bruce Gradkowski fumbled a low snap in the second quarter, and linebacker Adrian Hubbard pounced on it for the recovery at the Steelers 47-yard line. Six plays later, quarterback Scott Tolzien connected with Rodgers for a 21-yard touchdown.\n\n\"I guess the quarterback and the center weren't on the same page,\" Hubbard said. \"Between them, the ball was on the ground and I just picked it up.\"\n\nSelf-reflection: There were two prisms through which to view tailback Alonzo Harris' performance against the Steelers. The glass-half-full approach would notice that Harris took the No. 3 running back reps ahead of Rajion Neal, who at one point seemed to have a firm hold on the spot behind Eddie Lacy and James Starks.\n\nBut then there is the glass-half-empty, and that is what Harris himself chose to focus on. Harris, an undrafted rookie from Louisiana-Lafayette, dropped two easy passes from Tolzien, one on a screen pass and one on a short check-down over the middle of the field.\n\n\"I kind felt like I let myself down a little bit today, let my teammates down by dropping those two balls,\" Harris said. \" ... I can't sugarcoat it. I feel like they do have faith in me going into the game as far as running, catching, everything. I have probably taken two steps back with those two dropped balls today.\"\n\nAbsentees: Safety Morgan Burnett, who missed multiple practices this week while attending to a personal matter, did not play.
