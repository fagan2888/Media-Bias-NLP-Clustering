Through Saturday, that number had jumped to 1,645,698.\n\nThe government estimates that just 10 million Americans will sign up for plans on the health care exchanges for next year, a small increase over the 9 million-plus enrollees it attracted for 2015 and far short of the 21 million that budget analysts initially projected.\n\nPresident Obama has said it will be harder than ever to find people who haven\u2019t signed up during the first two years, and that reaching them is critical to making his signature law succeed.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Roughly 1.6 million people have selected coverage on HealthCare.gov, the Obama administration said Wednesday in a snapshot of enrollment through the first three weeks of signups for the 2016 plan year.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Roughly 1.6 million people have selected coverage on HealthCare.gov, the Obama administration said Wednesday in a snapshot of enrollment through the first three weeks of signups for the 2016 plan year.", "title": "About 1.6M have picked Obamacare plans so far: HHS", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/nov/25/about-16m-have-picked-obamacare-plans-so-far-hhs/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/11/25/Obama_Medal_of_Freedo_Live.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/11/25/Obama_Medal_of_Freedo_Live.jpg", "description": "Roughly 1.6 million people have selected coverage on HealthCare.gov, the Obama administration said Wednesday in a snapshot of enrollment through the first three weeks of signups for the 2016 plan year", "card": "summary", "title": "About 1.6M have picked Obamacare plans so far: HHS"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Health Medical Pharma, Social Issues"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe are three weeks into open enrollment, and we continue to see demand for the quality, affordable health coverage available through the marketplace,\u201d HHS Secretary Sylvia Mathew Burwell said.\nLast week, the administration said 1,077,876 enrollees had picked a plan for the first time or renewed coverage they already had through the federal website.\nNow in its third year, this round of Obamacare signups began Nov. 1 and lasts through Jan. 31.\nRoughly 1.6 million people have selected coverage on HealthCare.gov, the Obama administration said Wednesday in a snapshot of enrollment through the first three weeks of signups for the 2016 plan year.\n\u201cThis Thanksgiving holiday, I encourage families to talk about the importance of getting covered and to visit HealthCare.gov to find the coverage that fits their health needs and their budgets,\u201d she added."}
