She studied cello in college and planned on going professional.\n\nBut then she started to get shooting pains in her left hand when she practiced. Her fingers were tingling. And surgery did nothing to help.\n\n\u201cI started losing muscle mass in my hand,\u201d Huberth says.\n\nBy graduation, she couldn\u2019t lift her pinky anymore or stretch her index finger back to play B flat.\n\n\u201cIt became very apparent at the end of college that I couldn\u2019t pursue performance anymore,\u201d she says.\n\nHuberth threw herself into studying the science of music. She\u2019s now a Ph.D. student at Stanford University\u2019s Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics, where she\u2019s become adept at a new musical instrument: her laptop.\n\n\u201cUsing a laptop, you can do anything that isn\u2019t even physically possible,\u201d she explains. \u201cYou can have an incredibly wide vibrato. Or you could simulate the sound of a string that\u2019s the length of the building,\u201d to produce an incredibly low pitch.\n\nToday, Huberth is the teaching assistant for the Stanford Laptop Orchestra. This is a class that meets Wednesday nights during the spring semester. Students write code to create their own instrument on the computer, which they will score into a full orchestral work by the end of the semester.\n\nSeveral students in the class have a musical background, like Huberth, while several others come from computer science or engineering.\n\n\u201cI studied physics and I have kind of a tech background,\u201d graduate student Tim O\u2019Brien says. \u201cBut I loved music all my life, so it kind of combines everything.\u201d\n\nAt a recent class meeting, he and 13 other students sat on rows of meditation pillows, fixing code on their laptops and fiddling with speakers made out of IKEA salad bowls.\n\nThey rehearsed ensemble pieces that they will perform at an upcoming chamber concert, and demonstrated their individual solo instruments.\n\nO\u2019Brien began his demo by taking a big breath and blowing softly into his laptop. Then he jingled his car keys over the keyboard and tapped his water bottle. He programmed his computer\u2019s microphone to translate these human actions into a morphed, electronic sound. The class loved it. And so did the orchestra director.\n\n\u201cThat was nothing short of magical,\u201d says Ge Wang, assistant professor of music at Stanford. \u201cTim was able to really find this mix where human meets machine. And in that way, it was like this dialogue. But what came out of the computer was a sound that would not come anywhere except through a computer.\u201d\n\nWang and Huberth also like when students get physical with the medium. For example, one student is programming an armband to produce sounds when he stretches or clenches his hand. Other students use Gametraks, little black boxes originally used as a video game control, that have two red retractable cables. Students connect them to their laptops and program them to produce different notes or rhythms when they pull them up, down, left or right.\n\n\u201cWe can rapidly prototype physical gestures, interactions and map them to sound,\u201d Wang explains. \u201cIt enables a way to quickly explore a whole world of new sounds, interactions, and performance practices.\u201d\n\nWang says this makes for a better experience for the audience \u2013 one that is both pleasing to listen to and also interesting to watch.\n\nHe says this is one of the ways laptop orchestra is evolving as a medium. Wang was a founding member of the first laptop orchestra, launched at Princeton University 10 years ago. He started the Stanford Laptop Orchestra, known affectionately as Slork, in 2008. Today, there are more than 70 laptop orchestras, but Wang says they\u2019re still really just beginning.\n\n\u201cTen years may be a long time in computer years. To really make it into an art form, it\u2019s still quite early,\u201d Wang says.\n\nBut some more advanced laptop musicians are pushing boundaries. Madeline Huberth helped form a chamber group called Sidelobe, which meets year-round and works on reinterpreting earlier compositions, choosing from a young but growing library of more than 300 works.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been pulling pieces from the canon, from the laptop orchestra canon,\u201d Huberth says. \u201cPieces that have done very well, that have been written by more seasoned composers, and we\u2019re giving these performances new life.\u201d\n\nThe biggest challenge laptop musicians face is the same challenge all artists confront, Wang says.\n\n\u201cWhether a violin, cello, piano or a laptop, we\u2019re all looking for a different way to represent that spark of humanity,\u201d he says.\n\nThe Stanford Laptop Orchestra will perform a chamber music concert on April 30 and a full orchestral concert on May 30. The events are both free and open to the public.", "article_metadata": {"description": "'Using a laptop, you can do anything that isn\u2019t even physically possible.'", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Behind the Scenes at the Stanford Laptop Orchestra\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/news\\/2015\\/04\\/25\\/behind-the-scenes-at-the-stanford-laptop-orchestra\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-04-25 08:00:35\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-04-24 22:02:17\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":10500136,\"author_id\":\"3205\",\"author_name\":\"April Dembosky\",\"author_display_name\":\"April Dembosky\",\"tags\":[\"Laptop Orchestra\",\"Stanford\"],\"categories\":[\"Arts and Culture\",\"News\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/news\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/10\\/2015\\/04\\/photo-e1429825646897.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "KQED News", "description": "'Using a laptop, you can do anything that isn\u2019t even physically possible.'", "title": "Behind the Scenes at the Stanford Laptop Orchestra", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/news/2015/04/25/behind-the-scenes-at-the-stanford-laptop-orchestra/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2015/04/laptop-orchestra-5.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqednews", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "laptop orchestra,stanford", "google-site-verification": "Oam-TnlJjUP-cg8UEyR3-KcLp8_-WTy6_dBaSws1ADA", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf52a\"", "article_summary": "The Stanford Laptop Orchestra will perform a chamber music concert on April 30 and a full orchestral concert on May 30.\nHe started the Stanford Laptop Orchestra, known affectionately as Slork, in 2008.\nToday, Huberth is the teaching assistant for the Stanford Laptop Orchestra.\nHe says this is one of the ways laptop orchestra is evolving as a medium.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been pulling pieces from the canon, from the laptop orchestra canon,\u201d Huberth says."}
