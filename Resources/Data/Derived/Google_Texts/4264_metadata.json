Hodges decision that found same-sex couples have a constitutional right to marriage, \"unauthoritative, void, and of no effect.\"\n\nRep. Pody, who has been fighting to pass his bill since last year, in December told supporters, \"I believe God talks to me in prayer,\" and added that God told him to file the bill.\n\nThe bill, HB 1412, would also require the state Attorney General to defend in court any and all lawsuits against the State and its employees who refuse to honor the legal marriages of same-sex couples, making it \"the policy of the State of Tennessee to defend natural marriage as recognized by the people of Tennessee, in the Constitution and laws of the State of Tennessee, consistent with natural law, and the written United States Constitution.\"\n\nA state-required fiscal impact report finds the legislation, should it become law, would cost the taxpayers of Tennessee $8.5 billion annually. Those costs do not appear to include court and legal costs. The majority of the costs would come as the withdrawal of federal funding of Tennessee's Obamacare program, food stamps (SNAP), and welfare payments (TANF).\n\nAs NCRM reported last week, the legislation compares same-sex marriage to forced sterilization and Japanese internment, and its language in parts is identical to a South Carolina bill of the same name.\n\nLawmakers will vote on the bill, which is clearly unconstitutional, Wednesday, January 20.\n\nThe Tennessee Equality Project is fighting the legislation:\n\nFIGHT BACK against the Tennessee Natural Marriage Defense Act! https://t.co/XkxFcfwk6g \u2014 TN Equality Project (@tnequality) January 14, 2016\n\nImage via Facebook", "article_metadata": {"Description": "Legislation Would Cost Taxpayers $8.5 Billion Annually", "Title": "TN Lawmaker's Bill That Would 'Void' Same-Sex Marriages Scheduled For Vote", "csrf-token": "kK1KNqY6XUaH2v5fLV/gEbKAXdksRyN7p5MYgbDDcwI=", "twitter": {"description": "Legislation Would Cost Taxpayers $8.5 Billion Annually", "creator": "davidbadash", "image": {"src": "http://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/thenewcivilrightsmovement/pages/15377/meta_images/original/mark_pody_2.jpg?1452785060"}, "title": "TN Lawmaker's Bill That Would 'Void' Same-Sex Marriages Scheduled For Vote", "site": "@newcivilrights", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "og": {"site_name": "The New Civil Rights Movement", "description": "Legislation Would Cost Taxpayers $8.5 Billion Annually", "title": "TN Lawmaker's Bill That Would 'Void' Same-Sex Marriages Scheduled For Vote", "url": "http://www.thenewcivilrightsmovement.com/davidbadash/lawmakers_to_vote_on_bill_that_would_void_supreme_court_same_sex_marriage_decision", "image": "http://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/thenewcivilrightsmovement/pages/15377/meta_images/original/mark_pody_2.jpg?1452785060", "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "jP8OBaknsLrLrUReRa1iFj24dVZU6CQhTstvxQf6Mo8", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The bill would declare all marriages of same-sex couples \"void and unenforceable in Tennessee.\"\nThe Tennessee Equality Project is fighting the legislation:FIGHT BACK against the Tennessee Natural Marriage Defense Act!\nIt would also declare any \"court decision purporting to strike down natural marriage,\" including the historic Obergefell v.
