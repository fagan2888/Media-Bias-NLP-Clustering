Water managers start to cope with states new groundwater law

• As the drought enters fourth year, coming to grips with first regulations in state history • Without sustainability were on a dead-end road

by Eric Miller, CVBT North Valley CorrespondentCHICOFebruary 16, 2015 9:02pmLike gold, it lies beneath ground. We use it but dont manage it. My interest in it may differ from yours. But if we dont cooperate, the resource may go away and were both hurt. What is it?

Groundwater.

Two months into 2015, the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA) causes head scratching. Water managers and policy makers are unsure how to get to first base.

The SGMA, which took effect January 1, requires that groundwater sustainability plans be adopted for priority groundwater basins in California. Of the states 515 groundwater basins, the Department of Water Resources (DWR) ranks 127 as high or medium priority basins. These priority basins account for 96 percent of Californias annual groundwater pumping, and supply 88 percent of overlying populations.

The bottom line is that Californias population growth, coupled with that pesky multi-year drought, pitch one-two strikes that stress out the aquifers.

SGMA requires that by 2017, local groundwater sustainability agencies are identified to manage groundwater. By 2020, basins experiencing overdraft must have a plan that demonstrates sustainable groundwater use.

The issues are difficult for laypersons to latch onto. First, understanding hydrogeology and interpreting groundwater data requires the complex review of reports, charts, maps, and computer models. Its pure fun for science geeks, but dry as unbuttered popcorn for those of us with normal brainpower. Second, the process to form new governmental agencies is about as sexy as pocket lint.

Heres the big picture

Californias total water supply, according to DWR, is approximately 43 million acre-feet per year (an acre-foot of water is roughly 326,000 gallons, the amount of water consumed by a suburban family household). An acre-foot of water would cover a baseball field four inches deep.

Thirty-nine percent of Californias total water supply -- 16 million acre-feet -- is water pumped out of the ground. The balance includes surface water collected mostly from within the states borders. Nine percent of Californias total supply is imported from the Colorado River.

In December 2014, the California Department of Finance reported the states population as nearly 39 million. Thats enough to make California the worlds 35th largest country, if it were a country. But growth is hardly stopping in the Golden State.

By 2020 the population forecasted to gain another 1.7 million. By 2060 Californias population may reach 52 million, which exceeds the present day population of South Korea. Analysts can predict population growth far easier than meteorologists can predict when droughts end. Meteorologists may have more success forecasting tornadoes. Meanwhile, State groundwater elevations drop to historic levels.

California has regulated surface water rights since 1914. Over the last century, however, groundwater management has remained largely unregulated with the exception of several southern California regions that govern its use through basin adjudications -- legal decisions. Through the SGMA, local leaders get the first try at creating new governing agencies to manage their respective groundwater basins. If locals cannot solve problems, the state will intervene.

The North Valley approach  or approaches

Northern Sacramento Valley water managers proceed with caution as other groundwater users in California race to aquifer bottoms. The Sacramento River Hydrologic Region, which includes portions of Sacramento, Yuba, Butte, Tehama, Shasta, Glenn, Colusa and Yolo counties, provides about a fifth of Californias total water supply. Fewer than 6 percent of the states population lives here. According to DWR, about a third of the Sacramento River Hydrologic Regions water portfolio is groundwater. Among the tasks for managing Northern Sacramento Valley aquifer basins is getting started.

Setting up these new groundwater sustainability agencies may challenge some areas, says Scott Matyac, water resources manager for the Yuba County Water Agency. Were poised well in Yuba County. Our agency is governed by a seven-member board which includes five county supervisors and two at-large directors.

Yuba County Water Agency operates hydroelectric facilities on the Yuba River east of Marysville and provides agricultural irrigation water.

Weve successfully managed the north and south Yuba groundwater basins, says Mr. Matyac. Weve installed dedicated monitoring wells and report basin characteristics to the state. Through groundwater substitution transfers (when surface water is transferred to downstream users and groundwater irrigates local crops instead) weve exercised the aquifers and have a good understanding of basin sustainability. For Yuba County, creating a groundwater sustainability plan is more of an evolution than revolution. Plus our board is well aware of land use issues. Well schedule public meetings to discuss the SGMAs opportunities and challenges.

Further north, in Butte County, water governance becomes more complex. Home to the State Water Projects Lake Oroville, Butte County reaches east into the Feather River and Butte Creek watersheds and sprawls west across the valley floor. The Sacramento River generally marks the western political border.

We have several options for new groundwater sustainability agencies, says Paul Gosselin, director of Butte Countys Water and Resources Department. Local water districts could become their own agencies or multiple agencies can develop their plans and coordinate data sharing. Butte Countys groundwater management plan includes basin management objectives (BMOs) based upon historic low groundwater levels. But were grappling with hydrologic boundaries within Butte County. What we need is consistency in methods. The connectedness of our aquifer is widespread. We need to better understand the science to make management decisions.

Ted Trimble, general manager of Western Canal Water District, says groundwater management is necessary but expresses concern. Western Canal WD is located within Butte Countys valley floor. His districts territory extends west across the Sacramento River into Glenn County. Western Canal WDs surface water, from Lake Oroville, irrigates 58,000 irrigable acres.

Just look at the Central Valley, Mr. Trimble sighs, especially where groundwater overdraft has damaged a basins ability to rebound.

Western Canal WD shares similar soil features  adobe clay  with neighboring districts that surround the agricultural communities of Richvale, Biggs, and Gridley, valley towns adjacent to state Highway 99. The soils and climate are perfect for rice crops. Flood irrigation also recharges the basin. After dewatering fields for harvest, fields are re-flooded to decompose rice stalks. The area, a Pacific Flyway, attracts migratory birds.

North of Western Canal WD, orchards dot agricultural parcels that ultimately merge into the community of Durham, four miles south of Chico. These areas, and Chico, rely entirely on groundwater.

One concern we have is how Butte County addresses BMOs, says Mr. Trimble. Groundwater levels in my district are generally shallower than in other areas of Butte County. As a percent change in groundwater elevations, we can absorb more fluctuation than other areas. If a larger groundwater sustainability agency included us, how much flexibility would we have to change our standards because of drought or surface water curtailments from Lake Oroville? Sustainability for us is likely to be different from Butte Countys or Chicos. How are we to coalesce around the use of a common resource? We have different economic interests and views on sustainability. Legislation is needed but the governance may be tricky.

Dan McManus, of DWRs Northern Regional Office in Red Bluff, understands the concern. A geologist, Mr. McManus recently introduced SGMA to the Butte County Water Commission. Groundwater is best managed at the local or regional level, he says. DWR can provide technical support as agencies desire it.

The journey north from Butte County into Tehama County on Highway 99 crosses over valley pastures that blend into groves of orchard crops. On clear days Mt. Lassen (elevation 10,463 feet) stands out 50 miles away. Mill Creek and Deer Creek, spring-run Chinook salmon runs, slice through the valley portion of Tehama County before joining the Sacramento River. Sparsely inhabited, Tehama Countys entire population would not even fill the San Francisco 49ers Levi Stadium to capacity.

Tehama County Flood Control and Water Resource Manager Ryan Teubert, contemplates. I expect well coordinate with the shared basins that border Butte and Glenn Counties. But were unsure how to do that.

North of Tehama County, Californias fifth highest mountain lies smack ahead. Mt. Shastas (elevation 14,179 feet) volcanic peak is usually snow covered year-round. Snowmelt contributes to rivers named the Pit, McCloud, and the Sacramento, their flows eventually impounded by Shasta Dam. A keystone for the Central Valley Project, the dams outflow generates hydroelectric power and provides irrigation water.

Shasta Countys largest city, Redding, uses mostly surface water for its potable supply but also groundwater. The city, Shasta County Water Agency, and the Anderson-Cottonwood Irrigation District (ACID) actively participate with a dozen other agencies through the Redding Water Council.

Redding Basin water users have a good start for managing groundwater, says Stan Wangberg, ACIDs general manager. Transitioning from a groundwater management plan to a groundwater sustainability plan should be a bit easier for us.

ACID has surface water rights and provides agricultural irrigation water diverted from the Sacramento River. Mr. Wangberg continues, Our aquifer is in excellent shape and we continue to learn how it performs. Weve recently conducted groundwater substitution transfers and all of our wells recovered. We actually recharge the basin and contribute more water than is extracted. In our area, the Sacramento River is a gaining stream. With a full basin, groundwater flows into the river. But with controlled pumping and monitoring, we can open up aquifer capacity.

And how do you get to first base with SGMA?

The first step is to define the basin. Tehama and Shasta Counties may have different views. Well seek community opinion through public outreach, says Mr. Wangberg.

And what about private pumpers [individual groundwater users] who dont want to participate? Thats a challenge, Mr. Wangberg admits. If private pumpers wont cooperate, theyre subject to state oversight. We want folks to buy into this process.

Interstate 5 from Shasta County to Sacramento is a straight 160 mile shot. Road warriors may hardly notice the meandering Sacramento River which intermittently crosses beneath I-5 as it flows toward the Capitol, after weaving past Glenn, Colusa and Yolo counties. The Glenn-Colusa Irrigation District, a Central Valley Project contracting water agency, balances agricultural needs with surface and groundwater.

We need common vision to be successful with SGMA, says Thad Bettner, general manager for the Glenn-Colusa Irrigation District. The 2017 deadline sounds far off but its actually a tight schedule. At least everyone here is open to communicating. I think the countys water and technical advisory committees will bring good ideas. Were curious to see how the counties we operate in (Glenn and Colusa) react.

Glenn County Water Resources Coordinator Lisa Hunter, sheds some light. We briefed our Board of Supervisors and their direction was to continue educating the public on SGMA, she says. We have a good group of folks and may need to coordinate at some level. Glenn County doesnt want anyone to be left out but were not necessarily the lead, nor do we want to be perceived as taking over. Its too early to say what a groundwater sustainability agency, or agencies, will look like.

Muddy waters clear if unstirred. But it takes time and patience to wait it out. As for waiting out the drought, Mr. Wangberg sums it best. Without sustainability were on a dead-end road. Well crash. Were all in this together. We need to protect the resource for future needs.
