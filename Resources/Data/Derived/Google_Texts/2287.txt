Iran lashed out at the United States and the Obama administration on Sunday, demanding that America immediately take action to end its “racist, inhumane crackdown on blacks” and other minorities, according to a statement by Iran’s Foreign Ministry.

As the controversy over the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner continues to roil the country, Iran accused the United States of hypocrisy on the human rights front and of being a racist nation.

America must “stop police brutality and racist and inhumane treatment of minorities and colored populations in the country,” according to Iran, which leads the world in the state-sanctioned execution of children and political dissidents.

“It is expected from the U.S. administration and judiciary to comply with their duty and take lawful and just actions in dealing with their citizens and stop the practice of racism and inhumane behavior,” Iranian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Marziyeh Afkham was quoted as saying in Iranian press on Sunday.

The “U.S. administration [must] show respect for human rights and set aside its politically-tainted view on the issue,” according to Iran.

While America champions human rights across the globe, it is failing to uphold these values at home, according to Afkham.

“The U.S. administration has continuously criticized other countries and made an instrumental use of human rights and adopted double-standard criteria in the last few decades, while it has ignored domestic situation at home,” the foreign ministry spokeswoman said.

Meanwhile, Iran continues to execute its citizens in record-breaking numbers. It also continues to violently torture prisoners by burning them and even amputating their limbs, according to human rights activists monitoring the situation.

Iran also has sentenced to death a person who it claims “insulted the prophet” in a Facebook posting.
