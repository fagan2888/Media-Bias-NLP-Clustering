Duluth struggles with issues of housing, snow and more\n\nOn the 25th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act, or ADA, Amy Burke of Hermantown faces challenges all too familiar. She works part time, so she makes too much money to qualify for accessible subsidized housing. But she doesn\u2019t make enough money to rent an accessible home at market-rate prices. So, for now, she\u2019s living in a pop-up tent trailer. (Clint Austin / caustin@duluthnews.com)\n\nJust how accessible is our world? Duluth struggles with issues of housing, snow and more\n\nJust how accessible is our world? Duluth struggles with issues of housing, snow and more\n\nThe wheelchair struggled forward only as far as Amy Burke could turn its wheels. She bent over, leaning into Duluth\u2019s notoriously steep hillside, her outstretched muscular arms straining, and then quickly straightened up again to grab the wheels at the tops of their rotations, keeping them from rolling backward. She worked the chair this way again and again, gaining inches of real estate each time.\n\n\u201cHills are horrible,\u201d the Hermantown woman said last week.\n\nThere\u2019s not much that can be done about steep sidewalks in downtown Duluth, but 25 years after the Americans with Disabilities Act became federal law, plenty has been done here and elsewhere for people in wheelchairs or who are living every day with accessibility challenges. Once-unheard of things such as curb cuts, automatic doors and bigger bathroom stalls have become so commonplace, just seemingly natural stitches in the fabric of our lives, that they go largely unnoticed.\n\nBut more can be done, and that\u2019s especially true in Duluth, where the aforementioned hillside, heavy dumps of sidewalk-blocking snow, a tight housing market, the slowly changing and outdated attitudes of some, persistent disrespect for handicapped parking spaces and more continue to put up barriers.\n\n\u201cDuluth is doing OK,\u201d said Roberta Cich, executive director of Arc Northland, an organization in Duluth that advocates for people with disabilities and their families. \u201cIt\u2019s really exciting to see the changes that have happened (as long as we) keep in mind how far we still need to go.\u201d\n\nFor Burke, no issue is more critical at this moment than accessible housing. That\u2019s because she\u2019s living in a pop-up tent trailer in an RV park behind a liquor store. It\u2019s sweltering in the daytime and, because of its screened sides, freezing at night. And at the end of summer, the RV park will close. Burke, who sleeps in her car during particularly cold nights, isn\u2019t sure where she\u2019ll go then.\n\nShe used to live in an accessible apartment in Duluth. She gave it up, though, to go in with family on a house. When that didn\u2019t work out and the house had to be sold, she found herself with few choices. Because she has a service dog, a black lab named Beemer, her options are limited even more.\n\n\u201cWhat housing there is in Duluth, not much of it is accessible,\u201d Burke said. \u201cThere are six buildings built from the ground up where every unit is accessible. But every one of them you have to income-qualify. So people who are over-income, there is no choice. I have looked at everything.\u201d\n\nBurke works part-time as an administrative assistant for Duluth Builders Exchange. She posts specs and plans online for contractors to access. She earns about $1,000 a month. That\u2019s not enough to afford an accessible apartment at the going open-market rates. At the same time, with Social Security added in, she makes about $4,000 a year too much to qualify for an accessible government-subsidized apartment.\n\n\u201cI was told, \u2018Quit your job,\u2019 but I don\u2019t want to do that if I can work. I\u2019m just stuck in that gap. I have nowhere to go,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I quit my job, I can get housing. Otherwise, I can keep my job, keep my medical and lose housing. Either way, it\u2019s no good. It\u2019s not a choice anybody should have to make, especially somebody with a disability.\u201d\n\nBurke, 39, has used a wheelchair for about 15 years. She has reflex sympathetic dystrophy, which affects her nervous system. The condition stems from an undetected and untreated bone chip in her ankle that started floating around before touching a nerve while she was still in high school at Hermantown.\n\nA year ago, she became a member of the city of Duluth\u2019s Commission on Disabilities, the group\u2019s very existence evidence of a community taking as seriously as Burke does accessibility challenges.\n\nDuluth is doing well with issues related to the federal law, also known as ADA, so well, said the city\u2019s ADA coordinator, Bob Grytdahl, that the commission actually is marketing Duluth as a tourist destination for travelers with disabilities. In addition, commission members make regular visits to Duluth businesses to work on further improvements.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the width of doorways and, inside, if you\u2019ve got moveable items, things that can be moved out of the way, the gumball machine, the podium where the person stands to greet you, things like that,\u201d Grytdahl said. \u201cRestrooms are a big deal. A lot of older buildings still haven\u2019t updated their restrooms. \u2026 Lighting is another issue, being able to read the menu.\u201d\n\nSuch considerations are only going to become more pressing with an estimated 10,000 baby boomers a day turning 65 through 2030.\n\n\u201cThe wise entrepreneur, the wise business person is figuring out right now how to make their business accessible,\u201d Grytdahl said. \u201cIn Duluth, we want to be ahead of the law. The law is just the minimum standard. We want to do better here.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always important to keep awareness on access at the forefront,\u201d Cich said. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s exciting that the 25th anniversary is this summer. There\u2019s always more we can do. You can always go above and beyond.\n\n\u201cThe ADA is a civil rights law. It was the law that finally said, \u2018You can\u2019t discriminate against me because I have a disability,\u2019 \u201d Cich said. \u201cThe civil rights movement was in the 1960s. The ADA was 1990. It has taken a little bit longer for people with disabilities.\u201d\n\nBut we\u2019re getting there. We\u2019re making progress. And we make a little more progress every time a business owner shovels from the sidewalk to the street, every time a homeowner doesn\u2019t block the sidewalk with a garbage can, every time a broken automatic door gets fixed and every time someone who doesn\u2019t need it passes up a handicapped parking spot.\n\nAnother moment of progress, a major one for her, will come when Burke finds a place to live that\u2019s accessible and affordable \u2014 and she\u2019s able to do so without having to quit her job. She\u2019s on a waiting list for a partially accessible place. But it could be months. Well into winter. Well after the RV park closes for the season.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have enough housing for anybody in Duluth, period,\u201d she said. \u201cBut things are starting to change here. We\u2019re starting to get a better attitude. People are starting to understand.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping that (the ADA\u2019s 25th anniversary) brings awareness to the community that issues do exist and they need to be addressed,\u201d she said. \u201cThe disability community is no longer tucked off in a corner and forgotten about. We\u2019re being integrated with society, and we\u2019re contributing to society.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "opinion,our view,opinion,Our view,transportation,Business,Health", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Duluth News Tribune", "description": "The wheelchair struggled forward only as far as Amy Burke could turn its wheels.
