Arnold Schwarzenegger\u2019s re-election campaign, anti-Obamacare efforts and various pro-life campaigns.\n\n\"But by night I advocate for animals trapped in the government\u2019s taxpayer-funded experimentation laboratories,\" he says. \"Ending forced taxpayer-funded animal experimentation is my life\u2019s work. It\u2019s my calling. It\u2019s what gets me out of bed in the morning, it\u2019s the first thing I think about when I wake up and the last thing I think about when I go to sleep.\"\n\nA few years ago, Bellotti merged these two paths with White Coat Waste, a nonprofit whose aim is making folks on the right care about the estimated 25 million vertebrates used every year in U.S.-based laboratories -- many in horrific-sounding experiments, many of which are funded with taxpayer dollars.\n\nHow many dollars? Bellotti estimates at least $12 billion in tax funding per year goes toward animal testing; PETA puts the figure at over $16 billion. One of White Coat Waste's projects is advocating for more transparency in the federal budget, so it will be clearer how much money is actually at issue.\n\nThe Huffington Post recently caught up with Bellotti by email to find out more about how and why he intends to get right-leaning political animals involved in this fight.\n\nThe Huffington Post: What prompted you to start White Coat Waste?\n\nAnthony Bellotti: Back in 1995, between junior and senior year of high school, I worked as an intern in an animal experimentation laboratory in New York City. For eight weeks I watched horrifying experiments on animals that you wouldn\u2019t wish on your worst enemy. I witnessed, first hand, the harsh reality of modern animal experimentation, up close and personal, on pigs, primates, beagles, rabbits and smaller animals.\n\nAt 17, I didn\u2019t know anything about wasteful government spending on these experiments. I just knew that something was wrong with this picture.\n\nThe experience immediately and forever changed my life. In fact, I remember saying to myself: \u201cif this is one of the good animal laboratories, what the heck are they doing in the bad ones?\u201d It was a horrifying experience -- talk about shock and awe -- but it was also the best thing that ever happened to me because it changed me so profoundly.\n\nWhy are taxpayer-funded animal experiments a problem? What arguments do you use with people on the right to make your case?\n\nIt\u2019s a problem because the government\u2019s secretive and out-of-control animal experimentation budget forces you to pay for something that you don't like, don't need and doesn\u2019t work. We can save lives and money by cutting wasteful government spending that funds animal abuse. There are better things to waste your money on than cruel and unnecessary animal experiments.\n\nFortunately, the science has moved entirely in our direction in recent years, and is proving that experiments on animals have largely been a miserable failure. But don\u2019t take my word for it; even the FDA admits that 92 percent of all drugs tested successfully on animals will fail in humans. 92 percent! If NASA had a 92 percent failure rate, we\u2019d shut the program down stat.\n\nLook, there\u2019s a reason you don\u2019t go to the veterinarian when you are sick; animals and humans are different. And when you do get sick, there\u2019s also a reason why your doctor doesn\u2019t call the \u201cwhite coats\u201d in the monkey lab asking them how to treat you.\n\nWhat happens to animals in a laboratory is not relevant information to a medical doctor \u2013- a real doctor, not a taxpayer-funded college professor in a lab -\u2013 you know, someone who actually treats patients.\n\nBesides, if you don\u2019t support \u201csocialized medicine,\u201d why on earth would you support socialized \"medical research?\u201d And even if you support animal experimentation in principle, do you really want to pay for it with higher taxes?\n\nWhy are you focusing on bringing your message to folks on the right? Are you also working with people and groups on the left?\n\nThis absolutely must be a bipartisan issue. So we are working with, and taking our message to, folks on both the left and right. Concern for animals is not a left/right issue; it\u2019s a matter of mercy and justice. These are values espoused by each side of the aisle, and our message deeply resonates with people and groups on all sides.\n\nWe focus on center-right outreach because taxpayer-funded animal experimentation is a big government program. And if someone thinks big government programs are inherently inefficient, ineffective and wasteful, then they must also question the government's $12 billion annual animal experimentation budget.\n\nWhite Coat Waste is the only organization reaching out to mainstream audiences and center-right, conservative-leaning folks about animal experimentation precisely because we\u2019re a taxpayer watchdog. Our message is crystal clear: spending is the problem. And we\u2019re the only taxpayer-watchdog attacking the root cause of animal experimentation: wasteful government spending.\n\nWhat's your overall goal? Do you have incremental goals?\n\nWhite Coat Waste wants to be the eyes and ears of the American taxpayer inside the government\u2019s animal laboratories. Through cutting-edge, campaign-style techniques in research, advertising and lobbying, we\u2019re laying the groundwork for an unprecedented issue advocacy and public affairs effort. And we\u2019re forging a grassroots army to rally politicians and bureaucrats to ultimately de-fund and roll back forced taxpayer-funded animal experimentation.\n\nWe have a number of incremental steps and goals. For example, the [National Institutes of Health] should be opening its books and the National Institute on Drug Abuse should be immediately audited and investigated by Congress.\n\nLook, $12 billion tax dollars per year for animal experiments is simply the floor, not the ceiling of the government\u2019s animal experimentation budget. It\u2019s just what the NIH publicly admits to (and doesn\u2019t even include EPA, USDA, Pentagon and other government agency spending).\n\nThe federal budget is a nightmare so we have to jump through hoops to FOIA these bureaucrats because there\u2019s no transparency here. We think taxpayers have a right to know how their money is being spent.\n\nBut there\u2019s a bigger picture here: we also want to provide a voice for centrist, mainstream and conservative audiences, by speaking to fiscal responsibility in animal protection. We want to enlarge the coalition and redefine animal advocacy by bringing new blood into the movement. We bring a fresh, innovative line of attack that reframes a 150-year-old debate for new audiences. This is uncharted territory.\n\n\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\n\nHave there been any victories so far?\n\nRight now, we\u2019re developing the very first campaign-style, public affairs advertising campaign for television, print and digital channels on this issue. We just cut our first spot this summer and have a handful of other hard-hitting ads planned. We\u2019re also in the middle of a long-term, investigative research project that we think will rattle a few cages in 2015!\n\nWhat is the group's makeup? How are you funded?\n\nWe\u2019re a bipartisan mix of Republicans, Democrats, libertarians and populists. We're political consultants and public affairs professionals. We\u2019re advertising executives with experience ranging from Madison Avenue to Pennsylvania Avenue. We\u2019re campaign warriors. We\u2019re doctors and scientists too.\n\nBut most importantly we\u2019re all new blood. We\u2019re largely outsiders to the old animal movement. That\u2019s the common denominator that binds us. That, and of course, the principle that we don\u2019t think taxpayers should be forced to pay for painful, wasteful and unnecessary animal experiments.\n\n\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\n\nIt\u2019s truly become a grassroots movement. We are organized as a nonprofit and we\u2019re funded entirely by donations from the public. All contributions to White Coat Waste are fully tax-deductible. Unlike the animal experimenters, we can\u2019t rely on handouts from the government!\n\nWhat's your strategy?\n\nThe strategy is simple: drain the swamp. Because when the tax dollars are gone, the animal abusers are gone. We think White Coat Waste can save these animals and a lot of tax money through enforcing fiscal discipline in government and cutting wasteful spending.\n\nTactically, we want to clean up the government\u2019s waste and hold the animal abusers accountable through a three-step, campaign-style approach:\n\n\u2022 Identify the Waste: follow the money through research, investigation and analysis of\n\ntaxpayer-funded animal experiments.\n\n\u2022 Expose the Waste: permanent advertising to raise awareness and rally a new\n\ngeneration of taxpayers against animal experiments.\n\n\u2022 De-fund the Waste: grassroots activation, lobbying and coalition building with animal lovers, fiscal hawks and other taxpayer watchdogs.\n\n\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\n\nDo you think that all animal experimentation is wrong or is some OK? When is it OK?\n\nWhite Coat Waste is very clear about this: We only fight animal experiments that are funded by taxpayers. It\u2019s not that private sector animal abuse is OK. It\u2019s just that the biggest funder of experimentation on animals isn't big cosmetic companies or big pharmaceutical companies. It\u2019s big government.\n\nSo that\u2019s why we point the tip of our spear at wasteful spending. With the doubling of the National Institutes of Health's budget last decade, government has become the market maker for animal experimentation. So we understand that spending isn\u2019t the solution here; it\u2019s the problem. That\u2019s our focus. And it will continue to be our focus.\n\n\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\n\nIs all taxpayer-funded everything wrong? If not, what do you think it's appropriate to spend taxpayer money on?\n\nWe\u2019re not against taxpayer-funded everything. But we are certainly against taxpayer-funded experimentation on animals; this is not the proper role or responsibility of government. It\u2019s also an immense money pit of waste, fraud and abuse.\n\nIn reality, every dollar the feds spend on this senseless waste and abuse is one dollar less for disaster relief, education, air traffic controllers, national defense or any number of other worthy programs. So take your pick; virtually anything is better than what we\u2019re spending it on now.\n\nThis issue is winnable. White Coat Waste\u2019s team spent a great deal of time in 2014 laying the groundwork for this campaign and that meant studying the polls and focus groups.\n\nHere are the facts: public opinion is moving in our favor. The number of people who think that animal experimentation is \u201cmedically necessary\u201d has fallen 20 points in 20 years. And between 2000-2008, overall support for animal experiments dropped 16 points in public opinion polls. In my business, that\u2019s not a bleed; that\u2019s a hemorrhage.\n\nWe\u2019re on offense. The \"White Coats\u201d are on defense. So it\u2019s going to be an exciting 2015.\n\nDo you yourself have any pets?\n\nHa, well, I don\u2019t have any pets right at this moment. But I\u2019ve had animals most of my life. Dogs, cats, turtles, fish, even mice and Norwegian fancy rats.\n\nOne day, I\u2019d like to adopt a beagle who was rescued from an animal experimentation laboratory. I travel a lot these days so I\u2019m not well suited to care for a special-needs dog at the moment. But hopefully one day!\n\nThis interview has been edited for length.\n\nFind out more about White Coat Waste on the group's Facebook page.\n\nAnd get in touch with HuffPost's animal welfare editor at arin.greenwood@huffingtonpost.com if you have an animal story to share!\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Animal Photos Of The Week Animal Photos Of The Week\n\n1 of 122 A woman shares a tender moment with her pet during international dog sled race 'Zavirukha' (Snow Storm) in the Belarus capital Minsk on February 22, 2014.
