08/17/15 - Monday’s Topical Currents addresses higher education, and the acronym of “STEM”: That’s Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics.

Educators want to broaden not only the STEM acronym, but the performance of students and researchers to include the Arts, particularly writing. So STEM is now . . . STEAM: Science, Technology, Engineering, ARTS and Mathematics. We’ll have a South Florida academic panel on hand: Brian Schriner, Dean, FIU, College of Architecture and The Arts Michael Heithaus, Dean, FIU, College of Arts and Sciences. That’s Monday, at 1pm on Topical Currents.
