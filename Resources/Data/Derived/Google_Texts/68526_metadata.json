A couple of weeks ago, I wrote: \u201cLet\u2019s not mince words: Donald Trump is a bigot and a racist.\u201d I went with fascist. You say tomato, I say \u201cwatch out, that idiot is throwing tomatoes.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s not mince words,\u201d somebody tweeted under the name Helios Megistos. \u201cMilbank is an anti-white parasite and a bigoted kike supremacist.\u201d \u201c[Trump] may well be a bigot and a racist,\u201d one Michael Banfield wrote me via email. \u201cBut one thing is certain: The only thing missing from your photo is a [vulgar word for penis] in your mouth, gay bastard.\u201d Various Trump defenders derided Muslims as \u201cMuzzies\u201d and \u201cMo-slimes.\u201d One reader informed me that \u201cMuslims worship a man who f----- a 9-year-old.\u201d They spoke of the \u201csociopath Hussein\u201d \u2014 President Obama \u2014 and his \u201cIslamic butt buddies.\u201d But mostly they zeroed in on my Judaism, which they discovered from Internet searches. \u201cYou are a kike communist,\u201d one informed me. Another called my girlfriend, who has a common Jewish surname, a \u201cGross Jewess.\u201d Still another sent me a Nazi-style cartoon of a big-nosed Jewish man with a skull cap and bad teeth. Yes, those would be Trump supporters. But then, would you really be surprised if one of those tweets came straight from the Donald? The tweets I received in response to my Trump piece that week were more succinct. Like the one that simply said \u201cTraitor.\u201d ...the Trump-backers\u2019 venom is without precedent. His supporters surely aren\u2019t all bigots \u2014 but he is bringing the bigoted in from the cold. And giving them warm mugs of bile. The Washington Post goes more with\u2026 what is the right term for a former secret police official turned strong-man leader who rules through personal charisma, fear, and cronyism. Oh, yeah. Fascist. For Donald Trump, nothing merits respect more than high poll numbers, including his own, which the Republican presidential hopeful equates with strength, intelligence and success. In Mr. Trump\u2019s worldview, that simplistic formulation is reason alone to accord deference and esteem to Vladimir Putin \u2014 never mind that the Russian president is an autocrat whose popularity at home rests in no small measure on having silenced critics whose views, were they allowed a public airing, might put a crimp in his approval rating. For his part, Mr. Putin, whose cynicism and snarling vulgarity are mirrored in Mr. Trump\u2019s own political oratory, sees in the U.S. mogul a man after his own heart. For the Russian president, who once recommended that a journalist get circumcised, Mr. Trump\u2019s suggestion that Fox News\u2019s Megyn Kelly was menstruating when she challenged him must have seemed a bon mot, if a little too subtle for the Russian\u2019s taste. Ditto Mr. Trump\u2019s indulgence and outright approval of his supporters\u2019 use of violence. Trump and Putin would probably have some very productive meetings when it comes to dividing the world into Trumpistan and Putinia. And putting lots of signs on things so they know who owns what. David Ignatius on why, no matter what he says, Obama can\u2019t seem to calm down people who are determined to Not Be Calm. Obama\u2019s speech was a homily to American values. He welcomed new citizens from 25 countries to the fellowship defined by our Constitution and Bill of Rights: \u201cYou don\u2019t look alike. You don\u2019t worship the same way. But here, surrounded by the very documents whose values bind us together as one people, you\u2019ve raised your hand and sworn a sacred oath.\u201d Obama delivered a blunt message to those who are embracing Donald Trump\u2019s counternarrative of nativism and intolerance: \u201cThe truth is, being an American is hard. Being part of a democratic government is hard. Being a citizen is hard. It is a challenge. It\u2019s supposed to be. There\u2019s no respite from our ideals. All of us are called to live up to our expectations for ourselves \u2014 not just when it\u2019s convenient, but when it\u2019s inconvenient. When it\u2019s tough. When we\u2019re afraid.\u201d As Obama prepares to begin the last year of his presidency, he stands in an unusual position on the national stage: He is the rationalist, a creature of intellect rather than emotion. Dry as a bone, often disdainful of politics, averse to selling his policies (and also not very good at it), he is sometimes his own worst enemy. But compared with our other recent two-term presidents who stumbled as they neared the finish line, Obama seems to be gaining strength. Reason vs. rhetoric. Logic vs. Fear. Steel-cage death match scheduled for next November. The New York Times looks back\u2026 no, wait. That\u2019s forward. Or is it?\n\nHow many laws making it harder to get an abortion will pass before the Supreme Court sees them for what they are \u2014 part of a tireless, coordinated nationwide assault on the right of women to control what happens with their own bodies without the interference of politicians? One answer is, no fewer than 288. That\u2019s how many abortion restrictions states have enacted since the beginning of 2011, when aggressively anti-choice lawmakers swept into statehouses around the country. The trend accelerated in 2015, as state legislators passed 57 new constraints on a woman\u2019s right to choose. Hundreds more were considered, most of which could come up again in 2016.\n\nRoss Douthat and the Secret Fate of Obamacare\u2026\n\nFor the first six years of the Obama era, many Republicans made an apocalyptic case against the president\u2019s health care law. It was unconstitutional, immoral, borderline tyrannical. It wouldn\u2019t just fail: It would fail disastrously, in a death spiral that would take down most of American health care as we know it. Then the apocalypse failed to arrive. The law survived two Supreme Court challenges; it survived the website fiasco during its rollout; it survived the wave of cancellations and premium increases; it successfully enrolled millions of the uninsured. At which point Republicans, never particularly eager to grapple with the actual details of health care policy, began talking about the issue less and less.\n\nAs long as by less and less, you mean in every session of Congress, in every speech, debate, and campaign meet-and-greet. Then yeah, sure. They barely mention it.\n\nBut don\u2019t you worry. Obamacare is failing even though Republicans are totally leaving it alone!\n\n...after the initial surge, Obamacare\u2019s enrollment numbers have mostly disappointed. Not in a catastrophic way \u2014 the law has knocked down the U.S. uninsured rate to about 11-12 percent, compared to a pre-Great Recession level of 14-15 percent.\n\nThree percent? Why pshaw and fiddlesticks. Hardly seems worth doing. Of course, it could be that 16 states have not adopted Medicaid expansion, more states haven\u2019t implemented state exchanges, and states that have resisted both are the very ones where the rate of uninsured is highest. Let\u2019s look at the states where the uninsured rate is worst. Those would be Oklahoma at 15.36%, Georgia at 15.83% , Florida at 16.57%, Alaska at 17.21% and Texas at a whopping 19.06%. All states where Republicans have done everything they can to cripple the implementation of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nDouthat\u2019s \u201cObamacare is totally being a disappointment while the Republicans are being nice\u201d act is like the kid who has absolutely no idea how that lamp got broken.\n\nThe New York Times on rat-faced snake weasels.\n\nThere is ample evidence that drug prices have been pushed to astronomical heights for no reason other than the desire of drug makers to maximize profits. Prices in many cases far exceed what\u2019s needed to cover the costs of research and clinical trials, and some companies have found ways to rake in profits even without shouldering the cost of drug development. The two worst offenders are bottom feeders that simply buy companies they believe have underpriced their drugs and then quickly raise prices to astronomical levels. In August, Turing Pharmaceuticals acquired the American marketing rights to a 62-year-old drug to treat a devastating parasitic infection and raised the cost of one pill to $750 from $13.50. That brought the cost of a course of treatment for some patients to hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\nNote Douthat\u2019s crowing in the previous piece about that medical costs ticked up in 2014. Now note that about 10% of medical costs are directly attributable to prescription drugs\u2014not counting the cost due to people not being able to afford those drugs.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s try giving expedited license to create any generic drug currently manufactured by only one company. If that doesn\u2019t work, let\u2019s build a nice little factory for the FDA and let them sell the stuff at cost.\n\nAlessio Fasano on the mythology of gluten.\n\nMany people now vilify wheat as unfit for human consumption. \u2026 This \u201csensational science\u201d is fertile terrain for TV shows such as \u201cDr. Oz\u201d and books that identify gluten as the villain of the 21st century. Gluten has been blamed for many diseases outside gluten-related disorders, and therefore some people have suggested that it should be completely banned from the human diet. ... For the approximately 1 percent of humans with celiac disease, the immune system can\u2019t handle the cleanup. Instead, it goes into overdrive, producing autoantibodies that attack the tissue in the small intestine, leading to inflammation and tissue destruction. This leads to malabsorption of nutrients, which causes myriad symptoms, gastrointestinal and otherwise, in people with this autoimmune disorder.\n\nThe other 99%? Don\u2019t have \u201cgluten allergy\u201d because it doesn\u2019t exist. Multiple double-blind studies have failed to find any such critter.\n\nepidemiological studies, including our 2003 study in the United States, show that the vast majority of us tolerate gluten without any problem. The fact that about 1 percent of the population is affected by celiac disease, while almost 100 percent of humankind is exposed to gluten-containing grains, is evidence that these grains are safe for most people.\n\nSo, can we please stop stamping \u201cgluten free\u201d on things like sugar, which never had any gluten to begin with, and better yet start fighting the real enemy \u2014 the flood of godawful \u201cgluten free\u201d cardboard cluttering up the shelves at the supermarket?\n\nMichael Mitchell and Nick Wiger on the joy of eating at chain restaurants.\n\nAmericans are more polarized than ever, but chains remain a common point of reference. Eating at them is one of the few things we still do together as a country. Eight out of 10 Americans eat fast food at least once a month. Some months, nearly half of all Americans stop in at McDonald\u2019s (and 1 in every 8 U.S. workers has been employed by the fast-food giant). \u2026 Chains put us in conversation with one another. As we learned from the fans of our weekly podcast on chain restaurants, people forge fierce allegiances to their regional chains, such as In-N-Out Burger, Waffle House and L&L Hawaiian BBQ. National publications cover controversies over Starbucks\u2019s pumpkin spice latte or Taco Bell\u2019s Doritos Locos Taco. An unironic review of the Olive Garden in Grand Forks, N.D., by local restaurant critic Marilyn Hagerty went viral a couple of years ago. Hagerty\u2019s rave (she described the restaurant as the \u201clargest and most beautiful\u201d in the city) was met with predictable coastal mockery, but at least her sincere appreciation got people talking.\n\nI\u2019m still going to voice my preference for local places. I don\u2019t like McDonalds, but then I\u2019m kind of blah on the whole beef thing. It\u2019s not because I seek out healthy food, mind you. You will not find me downing kale smoothies. But if you come into Mr. Curry\u2019s from some Tuesday Tikka, or stop by Edible Difference for \u201cbricks and blood\u201d Wednesday (that would be grilled cheese and tomato soup) , or crave a Slinger Jr. at Chili Mac\u2019s, or slide into Pharaoh\u2019s Donuts just about any time, you\u2019re likely to cross my (ever wider) path.\n\nGet the full sized Chemistry Advent Calendar at Compound Interest.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Daily Kos", "description": "Kevin Baker\u00a0on how all those \u201cIt was because McCain isn\u2019t a real conservative\u201d folks got exactly what they want. \r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n The idea of two ideologically consistent, European-style parties that offer", "title": "Abbreviated Pundit Round-up", "url": "http://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/12/20/1462053/-Abbreviated-Pundit-Round-up", "image": "http://images.dailykos.com/images/188130/story_image/ChemAdvent.png?1450594410", "type": "article"}, "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "fb": {"app_id": 170357783709}, "twitter": {"description": "Kevin Baker\u00a0on how all those \u201cIt was because McCain isn\u2019t a real conservative\u201d folks got exactly what they want.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe idea of two ideologically consistent, European-style parties that offer v...", "title": "Abbreviated Pundit Round-up", "image": {"src": "http://images.dailykos.com/images/188130/story_image/ChemAdvent.png?1450594410"}, "creator": "@devilstower", "site": "@dailykos", "card": "summary_large_image"}}, "article_summary": "Ditto Mr. Trump\u2019s indulgence and outright approval of his supporters\u2019 use of violence.\nFor his part, Mr. Putin, whose cynicism and snarling vulgarity are mirrored in Mr. Trump\u2019s own political oratory, sees in the U.S. mogul a man after his own heart.\nAll states where Republicans have done everything they can to cripple the implementation of the Affordable Care Act.\nTrump and Putin would probably have some very productive meetings when it comes to dividing the world into Trumpistan and Putinia.\nA couple of weeks ago, I wrote: \u201cLet\u2019s not mince words: Donald Trump is a bigot and a racist.\u201d I went with fascist."}
