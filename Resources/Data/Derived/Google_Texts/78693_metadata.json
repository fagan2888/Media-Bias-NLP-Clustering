Roberts Jr. responsible for the ascendancy of Donald Trump? The thought never crossed your mind? Then you probably haven\u2019t been reading the conservative blogosphere, where Chief Justice Roberts, target of bitter criticism for his failure to vote to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, is now being blamed in some quarters for Donald Trump as well.\n\nThe emerging narrative, reduced to its essentials, goes like this:\n\n\u2022 Once the Affordable Care Act became law in 2010, the Tea Party and other opponents of government regulation looked to the Roberts court to strike it down.\n\n\u2022 In the case that reached the court in 2012, Chief Justice Roberts viewed the individual mandate \u2014 requiring people to have health insurance or pay a penalty \u2014 as constitutionally flawed; in fact, he provided the fifth vote to hold that it exceeded Congress\u2019s power under the Constitution\u2019s Commerce Clause. That showed that he understood and accepted the essence of the constitutional attack on the law. But then he unaccountably rescued the mandate by calling it a tax, within the power of Congress to impose.\n\n\u2022 This \u201csucker punch,\u201d in the words of Ilya Shapiro of the libertarian Cato Institute, robbed the Tea Party of the victory it expected and deserved, instead delivering the message that there was no point relying on the courts and that \u201cif you want to beat Obama you have to get your own strongman.\u201d Guess who?\n\nRandy Barnett, a law professor at Georgetown University and an architect of the Commerce Clause-based attack on the Affordable Care Act, put it this way in a speech last week to the Heritage Foundation titled \u201cHow John Roberts Gave Us Donald Trump\u201d:\n\nBut at the very moment he was called upon to teach the American people of the value of their republican Constitution, Chief Justice Roberts asserted the judicial restraint of the democratic constitution and turned them away. And that, my friends, was the end of our constitutional moment. That was the beginning of the end of constitutional conservatism as a political movement. And it kindled the resentment and populism that led to Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cJohn Roberts Derangement Syndrome\u201d is how Prof. Jack Balkin of Yale Law School, in a post on his Balkinization blog, labeled the attack on the chief justice.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEven before the Trump-focused blame game started, Chief Justice Roberts was well on his way to becoming the political right\u2019s favorite punching bag. In a rambling speech on the Senate floor last month, Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican who heads the Judiciary Committee, defended the Republican refusal to move forward with President Obama\u2019s nomination of Judge Merrick B. Garland to fill the Supreme Court\u2019s vacant seat. Playing off an observation the chief justice had made shortly before Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s unexpected death, to the effect that the Senate confirmation process had become unfortunately divisive and political, Senator Grassley said it was the Roberts court itself that was political. \u201cPhysician, heal thyself,\u201d he said, and then offered this observation:\n\nJustices appointed by Republicans are generally committed to following the law. There are justices who frequently vote in a conservative way. But some of the justices appointed by Republicans often don\u2019t vote in a way that advances conservative policy.\n\nIn other words, could it be that the problem with Chief Justice Roberts is that he isn\u2019t sufficiently political in the right direction? That was certainly the message Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas sent last month when called the chief justice \u201cthe tip of the spear in playing politics.\u201d In remarks at the Heritage Foundation, he explained: \u201cChief Justice John Roberts knowingly, clearly and unabashedly rewrote Obamacare twice. What we are seeing is nothing more than naked politics being played by the United States Supreme Court.\u201d (By \u201ctwice,\u201d Governor Abbott was referring to the chief justice\u2019s majority opinion last year in King v. Burwell, which saved the statute from a contorted reading that would have stripped the federal government of the ability to set up insurance exchanges.)\n\nIn trying to understand how one of the most conservative members of the most conservative court in decades has come to be viewed by fellow conservatives as an enemy of the people, several possible explanations come to mind. Derangement may be one. A mind-clouding obsession with the Affordable Care Act is another.\n\nSign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, The Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.\n\nBut something deeper and more systemic is at work here that has little to do with the Affordable Care Act or John Roberts. The scapegoating of Chief Justice Roberts is the clearest demonstration yet of a profound shift in the political polarity of judicial activism. For decades, conservative politicians railed against the \u201cjudicial activism\u201d of judges who overturned democratically enacted legislation, accusing such judges of seeking to use the power of the courts to impose their own political and social agendas. It was one of the easiest ways to score political points.\n\nNow it\u2019s judges who decline to strike down laws who stand accused of being political. Not so long ago, \u201cjudicial restraint\u201d was a conservative goal against which judicial performance was measured. Now it\u2019s an epithet hurled at, of all people, Chief Justice Roberts, whose opinion four years ago gutting the Voting Rights Act of 1965 on the basis of a newly manufactured theory of federalism was undoubtedly one of the most activist of all recent Supreme Court decisions. That was the good kind of activism, it seems. Nothing political there. It\u2019s judicial restraint that\u2019s political.\n\nAre conservatives at all abashed at taking the vocabulary they grew up with and flipping it so openly? I see little sign of that, but I do think the energy behind the blockade of the Garland nomination is fueled by anxiety not only about what a more liberal court might do but in equal measure by what a judicially restrained court would not do. The fear of judicial restraint runs deep. Ilya Shapiro, the Cato Institute scholar who blamed John Roberts for Donald Trump, expressed it vividly. Lamenting the failure of the attack on the Affordable Care Act, he wrote, seemingly without irony: \u201cConstitutional conservatism simply couldn\u2019t survive judicial conservatism.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20160512032105, "twitter": {"description": "Even before the Trump-focused accusations started, Roberts was well on his way to becoming the political right\u2019s favorite punching bag.", "title": "Blaming the Chief Justice", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/12/opinion/blaming-the-chief-justice.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004400373"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/01/opinion/greenhouse-circular/greenhouse-circular-thumbLarge-v4.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/12/opinion/blaming-the-chief-justice.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004400373", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/12/opinion/blaming-the-chief-justice.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "May 12, 2016", "edt": "The New York Times on the Web", "org": "Republican Party", "keywords": "Supreme Court (US),Roberts  John G Jr,Trump  Donald J,Conservatism (US Politics),Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Republican Party,Tea Party Movement", "CN": "linda-greenhouse", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Linda Greenhouse", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/01/opinion/greenhouse-circular/greenhouse-circular-thumbLarge-v4.png", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Trump, Donald J", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By LINDA GREENHOUSE", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Even before the Trump-focused accusations started, Roberts was well on his way to becoming the political right\u2019s favorite punching bag.", "tom": "Op-Ed", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "CT": "column", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/01/opinion/greenhouse-circular/greenhouse-circular-thumbStandard-v2.png", "description": "Even before the Trump-focused accusations started, Roberts was well on his way to becoming the political right\u2019s favorite punching bag.", "CG": "opinion", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "May 12, 2016", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Op-Ed", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/g/linda_greenhouse/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/opinion/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified": "2016-05-12", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Tea Party Movement", "published": "2016-05-12", "section-taxonomy-id": "AD8090D7-4137-4D71-84C8-70DA3BD89778"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "slug": "12greenhouse", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20160512135225, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/12/opinion/blaming-the-chief-justice.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/01/opinion/greenhouse-circular/greenhouse-circular-superJumbo-v2.png", "type": "article", "description": "Even before the Trump-focused accusations started, Roberts was well on his way to becoming the political right\u2019s favorite punching bag.", "title": "Blaming the Chief Justice"}, "pdate": 20160512, "des": "Tea Party Movement", "nyt-collection": {"tone": "opinion", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/column/linda-greenhouse", "tagline": "The Supreme Court and the law.", "uri": "/column/linda-greenhouse", "display-name": "Linda Greenhouse", "identifier": "linda-greenhouse", "type": "column"}, "articleid": 100000004400373, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Blaming the Chief Justice", "col": "Contributing Op-Ed Writer", "PST": "Op-Ed"}, "article_summary": "Greg Abbott of Texas sent last month when called the chief justice \u201cthe tip of the spear in playing politics.\u201d In remarks at the Heritage Foundation, he explained: \u201cChief Justice John Roberts knowingly, clearly and unabashedly rewrote Obamacare twice.\nIn other words, could it be that the problem with Chief Justice Roberts is that he isn\u2019t sufficiently political in the right direction?\nDo you hold Chief Justice John G.
