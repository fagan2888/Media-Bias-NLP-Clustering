He also is a former Secretary of the Navy and the author of 10 books.\n\nWebb enters a field that includes frontrunner Hillary Clinton, Lincoln Chafee, Martin O\u2019Malley and Bernie Sanders.\n\nIn his announcement, Webb outlined a platform that highlights \u201ceconomic fairness,\u201d including inequities of high CEO pay and revamping the tax code; foreign policy; national infrastructure; criminal justice reform and improving the administration of government.\n\n\"[O]ur country needs a fresh approach to solving the problems that confront us and too often unnecessarily divide us,\" Webb said in a statement announcing his plans. \"We need to shake the hold of these shadow elites on our political process.\"\n\nIn his announcement and his online platform, Webb highlighted the importance of raising money to compete in the nomination process. Clinton already has a huge fund-raising lead on her competitors.\n\n\"I understand the odds, particularly in today's political climate where fair debate is so often drowned out by huge sums of money,\" Webb wrote. \"I know that more than one candidate in this process intends to raise at least a billion dollars \u2014 some estimates run as high as $2 billion \u2014 in direct and indirect financial support.\u201d\n\nDemocratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz welcomed Webb\u2019s announcement in a statement.\n\n\u201cSenator Webb has a long and distinguished record of service to his country, both in the Marines and in public office. His leadership on the Post-9/11 GI Bill is a sterling example of the Democratic commitment to ensuring the opportunities available for our veterans when they return home,\u201d she wrote.\n\n\u201cAs the field of 2016 candidates rounds into shape, a stark contrast is developing between the Democratic and Republican parties. Democrats are fighting for middle class families, and those still struggling to get there. Republicans are concerned only with those already at the very top.\"", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "INSIDENOVA.COM", "description": "Falls Church resident Jim Webb on Thursday formally entered the race for the Democratic presidential nomination for president in 2016.", "title": "Former senator, Falls Church resident Jim Webb running for president", "url": "http://www.insidenova.com/headlines/former-senator-falls-church-resident-jim-webb-running-for-president/article_691e576e-2132-11e5-bfbe-2364a0cdeac5.html", "image": {"width": 760, "identifier": "http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/insidenova.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/3/92/3920c5e9-0705-59a6-af0d-f2affdbcac3e/50d4ef0200f91.image.jpg?resize=760%2C597", "height": 597}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@insidenova", "card": "summary"}, "description": "Falls Church resident Jim Webb on Thursday formally entered the race for the Democratic presidential nomination for president in 2016.", "fb": {"app_id": 141311372689524}, "keywords": "headlines,headlines,fairfax,local,politics", "news_keywords": "headlines,headlines,fairfax,local,politics"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbae7\"", "article_summary": "Falls Church resident Jim Webb on Thursday formally entered the race for the Democratic presidential nomination for president in 2016.\nIn his announcement and his online platform, Webb highlighted the importance of raising money to compete in the nomination process.\n\"We need to shake the hold of these shadow elites on our political process.\"\n\"I understand the odds, particularly in today's political climate where fair debate is so often drowned out by huge sums of money,\" Webb wrote.\n\u201cSenator Webb has a long and distinguished record of service to his country, both in the Marines and in public office."}
