Single people across the U.S. mainland who plan on moving to Honolulu be warned: The Hawaii capital is the most expensive city in America for singles.

That is the conclusion of the Economic Policy Institute’s 2015 cost of living calculator, which adds up the price of a “secure yet modest” quality of life.

The calculator takes into account a wide array of living costs — from health care and groceries to transportation, rent and others — in 618 metropolitan and rural areas around the country. For people with children, this includes things like child care and day care.

A single person with no children, according to the calculator, needs $46,308 for a modest but comfortable life in Honolulu.

For partners with a child, the cost leaps to $79,046; fifth in the nation. A second child means that the couple needs $94,092 for their modest life, while a third child drives the price up to $121,410.

And here’s the scary part, both here and in those other cities: The actual costs for typical people are likely to be even higher. Among other things, the calculator assumes people will…
