The 45-degree weather didn’t stop Nina Pham from smiling or her dog, Bentley, from running around as the two reunited this morning at Hensley Field in Grand Prairie.

“After I was diagnosed with Ebola, I didn’t know what would happen to Bentley or if he would have the virus,” she said. “I was frightened that I could possibly, would not know what would happen to one of my best friends.”

Mayor Mike Rawlings and Count Judge Clay Jenkins made remarks before Pham spoke, thanking those who took care of the dog.

Dallas Animal Services, in partnership with the Texas Animal Health Commission, Texas A&M University and the College of Veterinary Medicine & Biomedical Sciences, the Texas Department of State Health Services, the American Veterinary Medical Association and the Centers for Disease Control, cared for the dog for the 21 days needed. The nationally-known dog is now Ebola-free and going home with his mom.

“Thank you again for helping taking care of Bentley over the last 21 days, caring for him as if he was your own and showing America that passion and love is abundant and alive,” she told the support team standing behind her.

Pham and Bentley played around until it was time to go home, where she said they would pick out his toys for his upcoming two-year birthday party this month.
