But Alejandro Escovedo and Richard Barone more than filled that void on Friday night at South By Southwest.\n\nThe duo's carefully and lovingly curated Official SXSW Tribute to Lou Reed gave the rock icon the kind of lengthy salute his long and creatively cascading career merits, ran a decidedly unSXSW-like two-hours and 45-minutes. Packing in 27 songs by 24 all-star acts, the show was at times uneven \u2013 much like the career of its subject \u2013 but featured plenty of memorable, one-time-only moments that will certainly become part of SX lore.\n\nSXSW: News, Reviews, Video | Top Photos From Austin\n\n\"It's the best catalog to work with,\" Barone told the Paramount Theatre crowd late in the show. \"It covers every thought and every emotion.\" Escovedo, meanwhile, took note of the arduous movement of the production, which led to a few lengthy waits between songs. \"I love all the noise up here,\" he said. \"It's great. It's very Lou Reed.\"\n\nThere were, of course, plenty of fond remembrances from those who knew Reed \u2013 especially Garland Jeffreys, who choked up during his long eulogy to his former Syracuse University classmate \u2013 and a little bit of irreverence to balance it. Jesse Malin, for instance, said that, \"I never met Lou Reed, which is a good thing because I probably would've gotten hurt,\" while Fleshtones' frontman Peter Zaremba noted that \"he wasn't a nice guy, but, man, he was one motherfucker of a songwriter and we owe a lot to him.\"\n\nThe tribute's artists repaid that debt with mostly strong and occasionally ambitious performances \u2013 none more so than the Baseball Project, which joined members of the equally all-star house band (guitarist Lenny Kaye and bassist Tony Shanahan from the Patti Smith Group, Blondie drummer Clem Burke and Ivan Julian from Richard Hell & the Voidods) for a shredding version of all 17-plus minutes of \"Sister Ray.\" Escovedo fronted a poetic and open-ended rendition of \"Street Hassle,\" and Barone played \"I'll Be Your Mirror\" with just his guitar and cellist Brian Standefer, accompanied by a film of Reed reciting the song's lyrics. Barone's performance of \"All Tomorrow's Parties,\" meanwhile, incorporated vintage Andy Warhol/Velvet Underground footage by Jonas Mekas showing above the stage. Bobby Bare Jr. acknowledged that his rendition of \"Oh Sweet Nothing\" was inspired by My Morning Jacket's version of the song at last fall's Bridge School Concerts, and actor Joe Dallesandro offered a recitation of the \"Songs For Drella\" track \"Smalltown\" accompanied by strings.\n\nOther significant highlights included Spandau Ballet's rich treatment of \"Satellite of Love,\" Sean Lennon's unrehearsed by still affecting \"What Goes On\" and Steve Wynn & the Miracle 3's \"Coney Island Baby.\" Jeffreys nailed \"I'm Waiting For My Man,\" Rosie Flores was well matched with \"I Love You Suzanne,\" Chuck Prophet tore through \"Rock and Roll Heart\" and the MC5's Wayne Kramer did the same with \"Kill Your Sons,\" and Suzanne Vega added a fresh kind of delicacy to \"Walk on the Wild Side.\" Lucinda Williams' \"Pale Bue Eyes\" was devastating, while the Fleshtones demolished the divide between stage and audience during \"Real Good Time Together,\" with band members stepping deep into the crowd and leading it through the song's chorus well after they stopped playing their instruments.\n\nThe night also had its moments of weird \u2013 veteran scenester BP Fallon joining the Strypes for \"Vicious\" and drag queen Sharon Needles crooning \"Candy Says\" \u2013 while the only outright flop was a botched \"Waves of Fear\" by Escovedo's Fauntleroys, who had to start the song three times before getting one right, the show's \"Metal Machine Music\" moment and a running gag for Escovedo throughout the rest of the evening. (Black Lips frontman Cole Alexander said his group wanted to perform Reed's much-loathed \"Lulu\" collaboration with Metallica in its entirety, \"but the amps aren't loud enough.\")\n\nBut that was long forgotten by the time the show rolled to its finale, with most of the performers onstage for a lusty \"Rock and Roll\" with Escovedo, Barone and Prophet sharing lead vocals and Spandau Ballet saxophonist Steve Norman lacing in solos. \"Lou would've been very happy,\" Barone predicted at one point. \"I think he would've liked the show.\"\n\nAnd he certainly would have had good reason for that.\n\nThe full setlist from the Official SXSW Tribute to Lou Reed included:\n\n\"Sweet Jane\" \u2013 Alejandro Escovedo and Richard Barone\n\n\"Cool It Down\" \u2013 The Bizarros\n\n\"Romeo Had Juliet\" \u2013 Cheetah Chrome\n\n\"Femme Fatale\" \u2013 Cindy Lee Berryhill\n\n\"Vicious\" \u2013 BP Fallon and the Strypes\n\n\"Oh Sweet Nothing\" \u2013 Bobby Bare Jr.\n\n\"I'm Waiting For My Man\" \u2013 Garland Jeffreys\n\n\"Perfect Day\" \u2013 Lousie Goffin\n\n\"Waves of Fear\" \u2013 The Fauntleroys\n\n\"I Love You Suzanne\" \u2013 Rosie Flores\n\n\"Coney Island Baby\" \u2013 Steve Wynn & the Miracle 3\n\n\"Candy Says\" \u2013 Sharon Needles\n\n\"Smalltown\" Joe Dallesandro\"\n\n\"White Light/White Heat\" \u2013 Escovedo and Barone\n\n\"All Tomorrow's Parties\" \u2013 Richard Barone with Cindy Lee Berryhill\n\n\"Rock and Roll Heart\" \u2013 Chuck Prophet\n\n\"Sally Can't Dance\" \u2013 Jesse Malin\n\n\"Real Good Time Together\" \u2013 The Fleshtones\n\n\"Walk on the Wild Side\" \u2013 Suzanne Vega\n\n\"Kill Your Sons\" \u2013 Wayne Kramer\n\n\"Pale Blue Eyes\" \u2013 Lucinda Williams\n\n\"Run, Run, Run\" \u2013 The Black Lips\n\n\"Sister Ray\" \u2013 The Baseball Project\n\n\"What Goes On\" \u2013 Sean Lennon\n\n\"Street Hassle\" \u2013 Alejandro Escovedo\n\n\"Satellite of Love\" \u2013 Spandau Ballet\n\n\"I'll Be Your Mirror\" \u2013 Richard Barone\n\n\"Rock and Roll\" \u2013 All", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Billboard", "description": "The absence of a full-scale, high-profile tribute to the late Lou Reed has been glaring, and surprising, since his death last Oct. 23.
