The 114th Congress begins Tuesday. Here's what the N.J. delegation hopes to accomplish.

U.S. lawmakers return to work at the U.S. Capitol on Tuesday and there will be several changes in the makeup of the delegation New Jerseyans are sending to Washington for the next two years.

For one, both of the state's U.S. senators, Democrats Robert Menendez and Cory Booker, will be in the minority as Republicans captured control of the chamber in the last election. For another, there will be some new faces with Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-12th Dist.) -- the first woman to represent the Garden State in Washington since Rep. Marge Roukema -- and Tom MacArthur (R-3rd Dist.) joining the 12-member House delegation, still equally divided between both parties.

Four Republican representatives -- Rodney Frelinghuysen (11th Dist.), Scott Garrett (5th Dist.), Frank LoBiondo (2nd Dist.) and Chris Smith (4th Dist.) -- will chair subcommittees. Rep. Frank Pallone (D-6th Dist.) was elected by his fellow House Democrats as ranking member of the powerful House Energy and Commerce Committee, whose membership also includes Rep. Leonard Lance (R-7th Dist.).

Several issues of particular concern to the state's lawmakers will command their attention, from overhauling immigration laws to making sure the federal government properly funds ongoing Hurricane Sandy recovery efforts. NJ Advance Media Washington correspondent Jonathan D. Salant highlights five of those issues.
