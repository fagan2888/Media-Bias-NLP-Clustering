Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz delivered a blistering New Year’s message on Thursday night.

Appearing on Fox News Channel’s New Year’s Eve special, the Texas Senator predicted that “2016 is going to be an incredible year,” while he slammed President Obama and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.

Cruz delivered a rundown of all the great things in store for the upcoming year, saying “2016 is going to be the last year of the Obama presidency. 2016 is going to be the last year before Hillary retires permanently to Chappaqua.”

Adding that 2016 will also see the end of Obamacare and the IRS, Cruz said it would also be the “last year until we utterly destroy ISIS and defeat radical Islamic terrorism.”

“Like 1980, 2016 is going to be a very, very good year,”

The candidate’s positive outlook for the coming year did not seem to generate the same positive reaction on social media. While some appreciated his remarks, many slammed him.
