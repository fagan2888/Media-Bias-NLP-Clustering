WASH United\n\nFor most women, something like \u201cmenstruation hygiene\u201d might refer to TheDivaCup \u2014 a reusable, silicone cup women neither have to change as frequently as tampons, nor worry about overnight leaks. But this isn\u2019t the case in other other parts of the world.\n\nThat\u2019s why WASH United denoted May 28 Menstruation Hygiene Day (MH Day). The truth is, a poor percent of schools in countries, like India and Africa, have functioning toilets and/or places for young girls to change their sanitary materials. In South Asia, less than three percent of girls know menstruation blood comes from the uterus. In fact, WASH cited one in three girls living in South Asia only learn what menstruation is after they get their first period.\n\n\u201cDespite the fact that menstruation is a healthy biological process, in many places all over the world it is approached with hesitance and misinformation because of deeply\u2013rooted cultural taboos,\u201d WASH said in a press release. \u201cThe silence around menstruation limits women\u2019s and adolescent girls\u2019 access to relevant and important information about their bodies, directly affecting their health, education, and human rights.\u201d\n\nUsing the hashtag #MenstruationMatters, WASH United hopes this year\u2019s campaign challenges societal norms pitting periods as \u201cshameful\u201d or dirty.\u201d Dr. Dani Barrington, WASH specialist and strategic advisor for MH Day in Australia, said achieving this is vitally important to women\u2019s dignity. Not only do available facilities keep young girls in school \u2014 UNESCO found one in 10 African girls miss school during menstruation \u2014 but it also empowers their economy, health, and human rights.\n\nAdditionally, factual information and education informs young girls and women where to access sanitary materials, as well as how to relieve period-related pain. What's more is they debunk myths, including but not limited to the idea period blood attracts sharks; it doesn't.\n\nWASH found many women use old rags, dried leaves, sand, even newspaper when they\u2019re on their period \u2014 and if hot water bottles aren\u2019t on hand, eliminating certain ingredients from their diet, plus yoga (which science shows increases pain tolerance), can offer relief.\n\nWASH continues to partner with other coalitions to spread their message, engage governments, and coordinate stakeholders. One such example is the Nepal Fertility Care Center.\n\n\u201cThe continuous support shown by the government, civil society organizations, development partners, donor agencies and media in Nepal is really encouraging,\u201d said Pema Lhaki, the center\u2019s deputy executive director and MH Day National Coordinator for Nepal. \u201cBut most of all, I am encouraged every time I say the word \u2018menstruation\u2019 to a woman or girl in Nepal. The smile that appears on their face is a smile that starts the conversation about something they have never really talked about before.\"", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "menstrual, hygiene, day, challenges, societal, norms, hopes, improve, womens, reproductive", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "WASH United hopes to end the \"hesitation around menstruation\" for the sake of young girls' and women's health.", "title": "Menstrual Hygiene Day Tackles Social Norms For Women's Health", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/menstrual-hygiene-day-challenges-societal-norms-hopes-improve-womens-reproductive-335468", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/05/28/menstrual-hygiene-day.JPG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "WASH United hopes to end the \"hesitation around menstruation\" for the sake of young girls' and women's health.", "title": "Menstrual Hygiene Day Tackles Social Norms For Women's Health", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/menstrual-hygiene-day-challenges-societal-norms-hopes-improve-womens-reproductive-335468", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/05/28/menstrual-hygiene-day.JPG", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/05/28/menstrual-hygiene-day.JPG"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-05-28T15:26:55-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-28T15:26:54-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "WASH United hopes to end the \"hesitation around menstruation\" for the sake of young girls' and women's health."}, "article_summary": "That\u2019s why WASH United denoted May 28 Menstruation Hygiene Day (MH Day).\nWASH United hopes to end the \"hesitation around menstruation\" for the sake of young girls' and women's health.\nAdditionally, factual information and education informs young girls and women where to access sanitary materials, as well as how to relieve period-related pain.\nThe truth is, a poor percent of schools in countries, like India and Africa, have functioning toilets and/or places for young girls to change their sanitary materials.\nNot only do available facilities keep young girls in school \u2014 UNESCO found one in 10 African girls miss school during menstruation \u2014 but it also empowers their economy, health, and human rights."}
