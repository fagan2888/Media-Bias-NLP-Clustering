Tyler H. Jones | Daily News\n\nLaGRANGE \u2014 After more than a year of planning and hand wringing, it\u2019s a done deal.\n\nWest Georgia Health signed an agreement Monday to merge with Marietta-based WellStar Health System in a deal estimated to provide $40 million in community benefit, according to independent auditors.\n\nThe deal is technically a sale under state regulation, although no money changed hands. The agreement will take effect April 1, and after that WellStar will act as West Georgia Health\u2019s parent organization. Local, day-to-day control of LaGrange\u2019s only hospital will largely remain in the hands of West Georgia Health\u2019s board of trustees, although big picture decisions will be made by WellStar\u2019s parent board.\n\nThe brick-and-mortal hospital will continue to be owned by the LaGrange-Troup County Hospital Authority, which currently leases it to West Georgia Health. On April 1, WellStar will become the new lessee.\n\nWellStar has agreed to infuse $84 million in capital improvements to West Georgia Health\u2019s campus over the next seven years and brings with it $2 billion in annual revenue and a network of hospitals, specialists and health care providers.\n\n\u201cI feel very relieved,\u201d said Jerry Fulks, president and CEO of West Georgia Health. \u201cI think we\u2019ve struck a great deal with WellStar and I believe the future of health care in LaGrange, Georgia, is much brighter.\u201d\n\nThe merger agreement comes in the wake of massive changes in health care under President Barack Obama\u2019s signature Affordable Care Act, also called Obamacare. Hospital officials have said previously the merger was necessary for continuity of services and that being part of \u201ceconomies of scale\u201d would be key to maintaining a hospital in LaGrange.\n\nIn the past, West Georgia Health had financial headaches. Between 2010 and 2013, it ran deficits each year, sometimes nearly $6.2 million, as in 2013. The sale of its dialysis center in 2012 and a round of layoffs in 2014 wasn\u2019t enough to turn the tide, and hospital officials started shopping around for a potential partner.\n\nThe health care system has since turned a corner and is now operating in the black, but its merger with WellStar will allow it to accelerate capital improvement projects, like the renovation of the Enoch Callaway Cancer Clinic. WellStar has promised to spend $30 million over the next two years on renovations at West Georgia Health, and Fulks said Monday he expects the cancer clinic project to begin by the end of 2016.\n\nAs the third largest employer in Troup County, about 1,400 people work for West Georgia Health, according to the Troup County government\u2019s latest Comprehensive Annual Financial Report.\n\nNo changes in staffing levels or employment will be made for the first six months after the partnership begins, according to the West Georgia Health-WellStar agreement.\n\nWellStar\u2019s CEO, Candice Saunders, has told the Daily News her company will make every effort to avoid layoffs by advanced strategic planning. She also said WellStar\u2019s goal is to retrain displaced employees and find them other positions within the health care system should layoffs occur.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s something that\u2019s been a long-standing tenant of our health system,\u201d Saunders previously said. \u201cWe really build our reputation on being an employer of choice and we have a very strong commitment to our people and our caregivers.\u201d\n\nIn 2008, the Troup County Board of Commissioners agreed to back a series of bonds totalling about $46 million to help West Georgia Health finance the construction of the new south tower. For West Georgia Health to receive a better interest rate, commissioners pledged to raise taxes by as much as seven mills if the hospital were to default on the bond. The bond agreement required West Georgia Health to keep at least 60 days\u2019 cash on hand \u2014 a threshold that was never breached.\n\nNow, under the agreement between West Georgia Health and WellStar, the bond\u2019s burden will be off the backs of Troup County tax payers and entirely the responsibility of WellStar in the event the hospital ever went into default.\n\n\u201cIn the unlikely event that Troup County would ever be called upon to make a payment for bonds \u2026 WellStar has agreed to pay the necessary funding to meet the county\u2019s debt service payment obligation,\u201d according to a statement from West Georgia Health and the agreement.\n\nAccording to financial documents released by the West Georgia Health Board of Trustees last month, the hospital is up to date on its bond obligations and has more than double the amount of cash on hand to stay within the bond\u2019s agreement.\n\nAfter April 1, signage and the name of the hospital will slightly change, but insurance acceptance won\u2019t, Fulks said Monday.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t expect there to be any changes in insurance coverage,\u201d Fulks said \u201cI think the services we provide are committed to our community.\u201d\n\nRead LaGrange Daily News this week as we continue a series on the WellStar-West Georgia Health partnership and evaluate how it will affect the community.\n\nTyler H.
