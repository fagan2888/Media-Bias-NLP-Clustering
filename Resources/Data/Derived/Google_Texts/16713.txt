Alvord, IA

Three generations of women in northwest Iowa have a very rare connection. They all share the same birth date.

"I was like, oh, what are the chances," Megan Bouwman said.

February 8 is a special day for Trish Bouwman and her daughter Megan. On that day, 49 years ago, Trish was born.

Exactly 27 years later, she gave birth to her youngest daughter.

"I loved it. I thought it was so cool. I always told people, especially when I was little, you think that is so cool, to share a birthday with your mom," Megan said.

"It was fun to share it with her. You always get to join in on that kind of stuff and go to her parties and it was my birthday, too," Trish said.

When Megan got pregnant, the family didn't expect the same luck, even while her due date was within days of their birthday.

"Everybody was like, 'You should induce that day.' I said, 'I am not going to push things along. If it happens it happens.' But then I started contracting on the 7th and I had her nine hours later. It was crazy to me," Megan said.

But when Spencer stopped breathing momentarily during delivery, the women's attention turned from sharing a birth day to cherishing their close bond.

"I can't imagine how my mom felt all those years. Now I know how she felt. I feel so close to her now, even more. I just love her so much," Megan said.

"Megan's my baby but I think that makes it even more special because it's my baby having a baby, so it's pretty awesome," Trish said.

Despite the odds and the probability of three generations born on the same day, these women share a whole lot more than February 8.

"It's a pretty incredible thing."

The women are planning a big birthday party next year. Trish will be 50 and Spencer will turn one.
