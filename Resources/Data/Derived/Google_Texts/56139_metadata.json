The 104-page book was available online early Saturday, but some details were published on the Journal\u2019s website Friday.\n\nThe hardcover version is scheduled for release Oct. 12, but the publisher said Saturday it could be sooner and that Powell is not doing interviews.\n\nThe escort said during a four-year period many of the activities took place in the players\u2019 dormitory.\n\nLouisville officials say they learned of the allegations in late August and immediately notified the NCAA. McGee left Louisville in 2014 to become an assistant at Missouri-Kansas City, where he was put on paid leave Friday night.\n\nUMKC coach Kareem Richardson, a Louisville assistant from 2012-13, called the matter a \u201cserious concern.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe all need to allow the process to run its course without interference,\u201d he added in a statement Saturday. \u201cIn the meantime, our coaches and student-athletes are focused on academics and basketball as the season gets under way.\u201d\n\nCardinals coach Rick Pitino said he tried to conduct his own investigation before being rebuffed by the school\u2019s compliance office. Pitino said McGee denied the accusations.\n\n\u201cTo say I\u2019m disheartened, disappointed, would be probably the biggest understatement I\u2019ve made since I\u2019ve been a coach,\u201d Pitino said at news conference Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s mind-boggling to me how all this could go on. I\u2019ve read that the statement that the publishing company put out and it almost got me sick to my stomach. My emotions right now, my heart is really broken.\u201d\n\nThe age of consent to have sexual intercourse in Kentucky is 16, though in some instances it could be 18. It is unclear if a criminal investigation has begun.\n\nLouisville Metro police spokeswoman Alicia Smiley said she did not know of any investigation by the department, saying it was an issue for campus police.\n\nUniversity police operator Peter Anderson said he was unaware of the allegations, and no staffers were available to comment. Cardinals basketball spokesman Kenny Klein initially notified the compliance office about the matter but said he didn\u2019t know if police are involved.\n\nLouisville retained Chuck Smrt of the Compliance Group, which assists schools in NCAA cases, to review the allegations.\n\n\u201cChuck is the quarterback of this entire project,\u201d Louisville athletic director Tom Jurich said. \u201cChuck knows he\u2019s the most well-respected person, probably, within the NCAA, and the NCAA has been involved every step of the way. We\u2019re an open book.\u201d\n\nThe Journal\u2019s summary of the book said that Powell brought women to 22 parties from 2010 to 2014 at Billy Minardi Hall, which houses Cardinals basketball players. The woman said that she and three of her daughters, along with other women, danced and stripped for Louisville recruits and players and performed sex acts with them, according to the book.\n\nThe 43-year-old Powell also said McGee offered recruits alcohol at those parties.\n\nIn the book, Powell said that McGee initially brought women into the dorm through a side door. The process evolved to the point where the escorts entered and left the building through the front entrance and had become familiar to staff.\n\nJurich said he didn\u2019t know if video surveillance had been reviewed to back up that allegation, calling it \u201ca Chuck Smrt or an NCAA question.\u201d\n\nMcGee started 57 games at Louisville from 2005-09. He played professionally in Europe before becoming a program assistant in 2010, and he was promoted to director of basketball operations in 2012. McGee could not be reached for comment.\n\nJurich and Pitino said they believe money was the woman\u2019s motivation for writing the book. Powell was paid for it, but said in an interview with the Journal that she believed it was important to tell the story.\n\nThe publishing company said it paid investigators and Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter Dick Cady to vet Powell\u2019s story, and based much of it on journal entries, photos and text messages.\n\nThe allegations were made on the eve of Louisville\u2019s first Red-White scrimmage. The Cardinals reached the NCAA East Regional final last season.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Louisville investigating if escorts were hired for recruits", "title": "Louisville investigating if escorts were hired for recruits", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/10/03/louisville-investigating-if-escorts-were-hired-for-recruits/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151003__andre-mcgee-louisville-app1.jpg", "height": 515}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151003__andre-mcgee-louisville-app1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-03T12:16:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T11:39:17+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc7c9\"", "article_summary": "McGee left Louisville in 2014 to become an assistant at Missouri-Kansas City, where he was put on paid leave Friday night.\nIn the book, Powell said that McGee initially brought women into the dorm through a side door.\nThe university is investigating the allegations involving former staffer and Louisville player Andre McGee.\nLouisville officials say they learned of the allegations in late August and immediately notified the NCAA.\nA former Louisville staffer brought escorts to dorm parties and paid for the women to strip and have sex with Cardinals recruits, their fathers and players, according to a book by an escort."}
