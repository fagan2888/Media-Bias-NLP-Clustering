Even before legal permission, there\u2019s the basics: electricity to run its computers and water to feed the servers that stores the reams of data they acquire. Enterprising state legislators in six states have seized upon this almost-too-obvious insight, and used it to draft legislation that would quite literally turn off the NSA\u2019s lights in their states.\n\nThis might seem like a good idea to NSA critics unhappy with President Obama\u2019s reform proposals, but the constitutional theory it depends on is profoundly dangerous. It poses a serious threat to that liberal touchstone, a federal regulatory and welfare state equal to the problems of growing corporate power and poverty.\n\nUltimately, this proposal to depower the NSA reveals that there\u2019s only so much that can be accomplished by right-left coalitions. Unless each side can agree to abandon tactics that threaten the other\u2019s sacred cows, the members of these coalitions must constantly be on guard against the man standing behind them waiting to stick a knife in their back.\n\nTurning Off The Lights\n\nEach of the six states (Kansas, Indiana, Missouri, Washington, Oklahoma, and California) base their proposals on model legislation developed by the OffNow coalition, a group organized by the radically libertarian Tenth Amendment Center. So too will legislators in the next three states (Michigan, Arizona, and Utah) that plan to propose lights-off legislation. So OffNow, and by extension the Tenth Amendment center, is more-or-less running the show here.\n\nHow does the legislation work? Basically, it prohibits any state entity and many corporations from:\n\nProvid[ing] services, or participat[ing] or assist[ing] in any way with the providing of services to a federal agency, federal agent, or corporation providing services to the federal government which is involved in the collection of electronic data or metadata of any person(s) pursuant to any action not based on a warrant that particularly describes the person(s), place(s) and thing(s) to be searched or seized.\n\nElsewhere, the legislation provides that any corporation \u201cthat provides services to or on behalf of this state\u201d which violates this prohibition \u201cshall be forever ineligible to act on behalf of, or provide services to, this state or any political subdivision of this state.\u201d So if a state\u2019s utilities \u2014 electricity, water, sewage and so forth \u2014 are owned by the state, they are forbidden from providing any service to the NSA. And if a state\u2019s utilities are privately owned, they must choose between cutting off service to the NSA or permanently losing their ability to do business with the state.\n\nIn most states, this would be largely symbolic: the NSA doesn\u2019t have installations everywhere. But both Washington and Utah house significant NSA facilities, and it would actually be quite painful for the agency to move them.\n\nWielding state power over industry to shut down federal surveillance is a weirdly cross-ideological idea. It combines conservative/libertarian disdain for the federal government with liberal enthusiasm for regulation to address both sides\u2019 concerns about NSA metadata collection. That\u2019s why in the two blue states with this legislation, Washington and California, the bills are cosponsored by a Democrat and a Republican.\n\nBut progressives excited by the bill should cool it. Much of this bill is unconstitutional, and many of the parts that remain should be.\n\nThe Power To Destroy\n\nThe bill is rooted in a theory that, in James Madison\u2019s words, would \u201cspeedily put an end to the Union itself.\u201d More immediately, it could empower conservative state lawmakers to cut off Medicare, Medicaid or Social Security, to frustrate civil rights enforcement or even to prevent federal law enforcement from investigating criminals.\n\nThe Tenth Amendment Center is one of the leading proponents of \u201cnullification,\u201d an unconstitutional theory which claims that states can unilaterally invalidate federal laws simply by passing their own law claiming that the federal provision is invalid. Yet their proposal to cut of water and power to the NSA rests on a slightly different constitutional theory than pure nullification. Under something known as the \u201canti-commandeering doctrine,\u201d the Supreme Court generally does not permit the federal government to command a state to take a particular action. Thus, for example, if the federal government wants to criminalize marijuana, then it can order federal agents to arrest marijuana users, or it can encourage states to prosecute marijuana users by offering them federal funds if they do so, but it cannot simply order a state to prosecute someone the state does not wish to prosecute. Washington and Colorado get to have their own drug laws and their police force is under no obligation to enforce federal law.\n\nApply this rule to the NSA, and it follows that the federal government cannot force a state to have its own domestic spying program, or to loan its own agents to the NSA. If the federal government wants to engage in surveillance, it must use its own money and its own officers to do so unless a state voluntarily agrees to provide assistance.\n\nIf Utah can cut of water or electricity to the NSA, what\u2019s to prevent Texas from cutting off power to federal agencies that provide health care to poor people?\n\nBut what if a state orders its state-owned power company to deny electricity to the NSA? Or if the state refuses to contract with any company that also provides basic services to the federal government? On the surface, these decisions seem to be covered by the anti-commandeering doctrine as well. Why should the federal government be allowed to direct the state\u2019s business relations any more than it directs its police force?\n\nChief Justice John Marshall provided a really good answer to this question nearly two centuries ago. In the landmark case of McCulloch v. Maryland, the state of Maryland attempted to tax a federally chartered bank. Marshall wrote for a unanimous Court to explain why state taxation of federal entities was not allowed. \u201c[T]he power to tax involves the power to destroy,\u201d he explained, and \u201cthe power to destroy may defeat and render useless the power to create\u201d the bank that the U.S. Constitution entrusted to the federal government. More recent Supreme Court decisions have explained that states may not enact laws that \u201cstand . . . as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.\u201d\n\nIf the power to tax includes the power to destroy, so too does the power to cut off water, power and other essential services to a federal agency such as the NSA. Federal offices could not possibly manage the kind of record keeping and communications necessary to operate in a modern society without access to electricity. Indeed, the OffNow coalition\u2019s website is quite explicit about the fact that they believe that the power to cut off utilities is the power to destroy the NSA\u2019s ability to operate \u2014 the NSA\u2019s \u201cmassive supercomputers monitoring your personal information are water-cooled. They can\u2019t function without the resources to keep them at operating temperature. That water is scheduled to be provided by the Jordan Valley River Conservancy District, \u2018a political subdivision of the state of Utah.'\u201d\n\nThis tactic, of using state power to prevent the federal government from operating, should trouble progressives regardless of how they feel about the NSA\u2019s surveillance program. If Utah can cut of water or electricity to the NSA, what\u2019s to prevent Texas from cutting off power to federal agencies that provide health care to poor people, or North Carolina from turning the lights off on federal voting rights attorneys challenging their comprehensive voter suppression law?\n\nBurning It Down\n\nDon\u2019t doubt for a minute that, if the Tenth Amendment Center succeeds in establishing a precedent for nullification-via-power-outages, they will immediately deploy this and similar tactics to implement other parts of their sweeping libertarian agency. Some of their other initiatives include bills purporting to nullify federal gun laws and the Affordable Care Act, as well as a truly surreal proposal to undermine the Federal Reserve by requiring citizens to pay their state taxes in gold or silver.\n\nNor are these the least of the Tenth Amendment Center\u2019s ambitions. A resolution introduced in the New Hampshire legislature and pushed by the Center lays out an expansive list of potential federal laws that it objects to on constitutional grounds \u2014 one of them is \u201cprohibitions of type or quantity of arms or ammunition\u201d \u2014 and then claims that the Constitution shall become null and void if the federal government enacts any of the laws the resolution deems objectionable, and \u201call powers previously delegated to the United States of America by the Constitution for the United States shall revert to the several States individually.\u201d\n\nLibertarians who endorse a constitutional theory that radically limits federal power will be happy to craft legislation consistent with that theory; liberals will find the implications of such a law repulsive.\n\nThe Tenth Amendment Center, in other words, is not simply distrustful of centralized power. They fear the federal government with such pathological intensity that they\u2019ve actually suggested dissolving the Union in its entirety if Congress, the President or the federal judiciary takes any action that violates their idiosyncratic view of the Constitution. Their position on states\u2019 rights makes John C. Calhoun look like a moderate.\n\nSo however attractive reining in the NSA this way might seem, it\u2019s a Trojan Horse: a legal strategy that has the potential to big down the major federal accomplishments liberals most deeply cherish. Good thing the depower bills are unlikely to pass in any state. Regardless, however, this incident tells us something important about the various proposals for a left-libertarian alliance to rein the security state you see bandied about.\n\nRealistically, that\u2019s the alliance you\u2019d need you take serious, nationwide action on spying outside of the executive branch; see the vote count on Rep. Justin Amash (R-MI)\u2019s just-barely defeated bill to end NSA metadata collection. It\u2019s the same coalition that could help accomplish worthy goals like reforming federal drug laws or racist prison sentencing guidelines.\n\nOn issues like those \u2014 where the policy fix is legally simple, and the goals are fully shared \u2014 the left-libertarian alliance has the potential to do a lot of good. But the state-level drive to turn off the NSA\u2019s lights demonstrates the limits of this marriage. Lawmaking necessarily sets precedents. In some cases, those precedents come from the judiciary \u2014 giving official sanction to tactics once acknowledged to be unconstitutional. But the mere act of enacting a law and getting away with it can normalize radical tactics as well. Hidden provisions of a law or the legal theory behind it can change the country as surely as the legislation\u2019s intended end.\n\nThat means the more legally complicated a policy becomes, the less likely there\u2019ll be any workable left-libertarian compromise to be had over it. Libertarians who endorse a constitutional theory that radically limits federal power will be happy to craft legislation consistent with that theory; liberals will find the implications of such a law repulsive. Conversely, even libertarians who might like the idea of providing everyone with health care in principle can\u2019t get on board with the Affordable Care Act \u2014 the theory of federal power it relies on justifies too much for their tastes.\n\nAny liberal-libertarian alliance, then, will necessarily be tactical and limited, or else one side will invariably lose out. With such fundamental disagreements, the center cannot hold, even on issues like NSA spying where the sides are broadly in agreement.
