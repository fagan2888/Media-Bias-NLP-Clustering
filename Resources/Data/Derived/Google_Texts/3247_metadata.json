RSV is responsible for about 125,000 infant hospitalizations and 400 deaths each year \u2014 10 times more infant fatalities than the flu.\n\nThe virus attacks the tiny bronchioles in infant lungs, causing fever and difficulty breathing that is one step short of pneumonia, Checchia said. It runs from November to March. In other words, the season is now.\n\nMost at risk are the 500,000 babies born prematurely in the United States each year, before 36 or 37 weeks of gestation. Their underdeveloped lungs have narrow, fragile airways, and they lack the complete complement of antibodies that full-term infants have.\n\nAlso at risk, Checchia says, are babies with lung, heart and neurological conditions.\n\nThe virus \u201cattacks their lungs at a time when they\u2019re most vulnerable,\u201d he said. \u201cYou need to know about this as a parent because it is something that is so ubiquitous in the population.\u201d\n\nSymptoms include persistent coughing or wheezing, fast or troubled breathing, spread-out nostrils or a caved-in chest when the baby is trying to breathe, a bluish color around the mouth or fingernails and a rectal temperature of more than 100.4 Fahrenheit in infants less than 3 months old.\n\nThere is no treatment, but there are quite a few ways to minimize risk of transmission. Parents of young children should wash their hands frequently and ask others to do the same, Checchia said, as well as keep toys, clothes, blankets and sheets clean.\n\nThe virus can live on toys and hard surfaces such as kitchen counters for short periods of time.\n\nAvoid crowds, and ask your pediatrician if your child is at high risk for infection.\n\nThere are prophylactic efforts that can strengthen infants\u2019 immune sysems, Checchia said.\n\nThe virus usually runs a 10- to 14-day course. So if a baby with those symptoms is not improving in three to five days, it\u2019s time to consult a physician.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2014/12/RSV-baby-001.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd932\"", "article_summary": "The virus usually runs a 10- to 14-day course.\nAlso at risk, Checchia says, are babies with lung, heart and neurological conditions.\nThe virus attacks the tiny bronchioles in infant lungs, causing fever and difficulty breathing that is one step short of pneumonia, Checchia said.\nRSV is responsible for about 125,000 infant hospitalizations and 400 deaths each year \u2014 10 times more infant fatalities than the flu.\nBy Lenny BernsteinI somehow managed to raise three children without ever hearing about Respiratory Syncytial Virus, or RSV."}
