Patients received letters this week and are already reportedly \u201cfrantic\u201d \u2013 canceling future appointments and scrambling to either change physicians or find a plan that includes the popular regional hospital.\n\n\u201cPeople are upset they are losing their family doctor,\u201d one LMC physician told FITS. \u201cAnd we\u2019re upset because this is our biggest insurance pool.\u201d\n\nWhat happened?\n\nAccording to a letter sent by BlueCross BlueShield to its customers, the hospital is \u201cdemanding excessive fee increases that are much higher than fair market value, national medical inflation and the rates that other hospitals and doctors request.\u201d\n\nHmmm \u2026\n\nThe provider also ripped the hospital for allegedly not going along with its efforts to \u201cpay providers based on the quality of care that they provide, not just how many services they perform.\u201d\n\nWow. Fighting words \u2026 although one national health care expert seemed to agree with the basic premise.\n\n\u201cHospitals prefer to get paid on the old system whereas payment models are innovating to pay based on quality not quantity,\u201d the expert told us.\n\nStill, LMC doctors tell FITS they are optimistic everything will get sorted.\n\n\u201cWe assume at the last minute a new contract will be reached,\u201d one told us.\n\nThat message was reiterated in a statement issued by hospital president and CEO Mike Biediger.\n\n\u201cLexington Medical Center hopes to continue negotiating with BlueCross BlueShield before the March 1 deadline,\u201d Biediger said. \u201cWe hope that we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement to care for the patients we serve.\u201d\n\nThe hospital\u2019s statement expressed \u201cdisappointment\u201d and \u201csurprise\u201d at the BlueCross BlueShield letter, and added that \u201ccontrary to statements from BlueCross BlueShield, Lexington Medical Center has been working to negotiate fair and reasonable terms with the insurance provider for months, offering proposals that are in line with previous agreements and that will allow the hospital to continue providing excellent health care to the people of our community.\u201d\n\nLMC further stated that it was \u201cstill in active discussions with (BCBS) about the contract\u201d at the time the letter was sent.\n\n\u201cIn fact, the hospital thought it was very close to reaching an agreement,\u201d the hospital statement read.\n\n\u201cThe substance of BlueCross BlueShield\u2019s letter to members and employers has unnecessarily concerned members of the community, creating undue alarm and confusion,\u201d the statement continued.\n\nBy the way \u2026 who\u2019s going to give us a medal for not reflexively blaming all of this on Obamacare? Obviously, it is to blame \u2026 but we made it all the way to the end of the article without throwing that stone.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.fitsnews.com/2015/02/20/lexington-medical-bcbs-people-freaking/", "site_name": "http://www.fitsnews.com", "image": "http://fitsnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/lex-med-578x370.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Lexington Medical, Blue Cross Blue Shield Battle \u2026 People Are Freaking"}, "google-site-verification": "qt01SY7jA5pURQJ_8ITASviDysHU8yHfJWpIIdAPKQU", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd40cd\"", "article_summary": "HEALTH INSURANCE PROVIDER\u2019S FIGHT WITH HOSPITAL ERUPTS \u2026|| By FITSNEWS || Lexington Medical Center (LMC) will not be part of health insurance provider BlueCross BlueShield (BCBS)\u2019s Preferred Blue network as of March 1, 2015.\n\u201cLexington Medical Center hopes to continue negotiating with BlueCross BlueShield before the March 1 deadline,\u201d Biediger said.\n\u201cIn fact, the hospital thought it was very close to reaching an agreement,\u201d the hospital statement read.\nFighting words \u2026 although one national health care expert seemed to agree with the basic premise.\nBy the way \u2026 who\u2019s going to give us a medal for not reflexively blaming all of this on Obamacare?"}
