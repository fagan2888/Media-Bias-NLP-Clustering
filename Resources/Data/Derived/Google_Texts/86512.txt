When real estate mogul and reality television host Donald Trump announced he was running for president, political pundits were quick to dismiss him.

And since entering the race for the Republican nomination, the outspoken billionaire has made enough gaffes to have torpedoed most any other presidential aspirant. His disparaging remarks about GOP candidate Cary Fiorina—“Look at that face! Would anyone vote for that? Can you imagine that, the face of our next president?”—made headlines. This just weeks after his crude comments about Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly, when he suggested that she had asked him particularly tough questions during the first GOP debate in August because she was menstruating.

Despite such blunders and his controversial remarks on issues like immigration, “the Donald” is the leading Republican front-runner, much to the consternation of party organizers and presidential candidates like Jeb Bush and Scott Walker. In a new Washington Post/ABC News poll, Trump led the field of Republican presidential aspirants with 33 percent of the vote. Bush received just 8 percent.

But there are subtle indications that the ground may be shifting. Fiorina made a strong showing in last Thursday’s second GOP debate, and another Republican candidate, retired physician Ben Carson, has moved from 6 percent to 23 percent in two recent New York Times/CBS News polls.

Despite Trump’s standing in the polls, serious questions remain about whether he can win the White House. So this week’s YouSpeak asks: “Is Donald Trump electable?”
