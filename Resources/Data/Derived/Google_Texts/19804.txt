Very few uninsured Americans — the most sought-after customers by Obamacare advocates — know the date of the deadline for signing up for health coverage for 2016, according to a survey released Thursday. Only 7 percent are aware that the open enrollment deadline is Jan. 31, the Kaiser Family Foundation survey finds.

And nearly half of the uninsured, 46 percent, say they've tried to get health insurance in the past year, but failed to do so because it was too expensive, by far the most common reason given for not obtaining coverage, the Kaiser survey showed.

Those findings underscore what may be the considerable difficulty officials face getting the remaining 10.5 million eligible uninsured Americans to enroll in health coverage for next year and future years.
