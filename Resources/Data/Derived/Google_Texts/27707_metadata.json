Instead of swiping the usual plastic keycard, they can wave their hand in front of a sensor. How, you may ask, does this magically open doors? There\u2019s nothing magic about it: Office workers have radio frequency identification (RFID) chips embedded in the skin between their thumb and index finger, courtesy of BioNyfiken, a Swedish biohacking group.\n\n\u201cWe want to be able to understand this technology before big corporates and big government come to us and say everyone should get chipped \u2014 the tax authority chip, the Google or Facebook chip,\u201d Hannes Sjoblad, Epicenter\u2019s chief disruption officer and a member of BioNyfiken, told BBC. Early knowledge gained from this project, he believes, will provide him with the insight necessary to question how any such technology becomes implemented in the future.\n\nFor now, the microchips, which are inserted by a professional tattoo artist (and member of BioNyfiken), are optional for employees. Each grain of rice-sized chip is encased in a small capsule, which also contains a copper antenna coil and a capacitor. The chip stores a unique binary number that is transmitted to the scanner. Along with allowing entry into the Epicenter complex, the chip also opens the doors of individual offices and makes the photocopier run. Shortly, the microchips will be used by employees to pay for lunch in the cafeteria and similar services.\n\nWhile some of the employees would \"absolutely not\" be chipped, BBC reports, others participate with enthusiasm in this biohacking adventure.\n\nWhat is Biohacking?\n\nA form of citizen biology, biohacking, in practice, amounts to a bunch of people coming together to learn more about biology by developing Do-It-Yourself projects. It takes place in small labs with mismatched equipment, where the intention is to learn as you go, to learn by experimenting. The point for many is participation, the point for others is to find new ways of exploring and using science. DNA and genes are a primary focus for most biohackers, though clearly the junction of technology and biology is the theme haunting BioNyfiken and keeping its members up late most nights.\n\n\u201cWe explore what we can do with modern technology on any biological being, from bacteria to plants and all the way to homo sapiens,\u201d Sj\u00f6blad recently told Radio Sweden. \u201cThe concept of bio-hacking has really developed on the basis of technological developments in lab equipment and in modern sensor technology. What 10 years ago was only possible to do in a big lab can now be done by two students in a dorm room.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "biohacking, hi tech, wearable technology", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "BioNyfiken, a Swedish biohacking group, has embedded radio frequency identification (RFID) chips in the hands of hi-tech office workers.", "title": "Taking Wearable Tech To The Next Level: Implanted Microchips [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/adventures-biohacking-hi-tech-swedish-building-complex-implants-rfid-microchips-321180", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/02/06/microchip.JPG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "BioNyfiken, a Swedish biohacking group, has embedded radio frequency identification (RFID) chips in the hands of hi-tech office workers.", "title": "Taking Wearable Tech To The Next Level: Implanted Microchips [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/adventures-biohacking-hi-tech-swedish-building-complex-implants-rfid-microchips-321180", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/02/06/microchip.JPG", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/02/06/microchip.JPG"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Innovation", "published_time": "2015-02-06T13:36:23-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-06T13:36:22-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "BioNyfiken, a Swedish biohacking group, has embedded radio frequency identification (RFID) chips in the hands of hi-tech office workers."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe21c7\"", "article_summary": "Employees at the Epicenter building complex in Stockholm, Sweden have a new option when it comes to entering the building.\nA form of citizen biology, biohacking, in practice, amounts to a bunch of people coming together to learn more about biology by developing Do-It-Yourself projects.\nFor now, the microchips, which are inserted by a professional tattoo artist (and member of BioNyfiken), are optional for employees.\nWhile some of the employees would \"absolutely not\" be chipped, BBC reports, others participate with enthusiasm in this biohacking adventure.\n\u201cThe concept of bio-hacking has really developed on the basis of technological developments in lab equipment and in modern sensor technology."}
