In Kenya’s deadliest attack since 1998, 148 students and staff were killed on the campus of Garissa Unversity College on Thursday. The country’s Interior Ministry said on Sunday that one of the four gunmen was the son of a Kenyan government official, whose father had reported him missing in 2014.

The attack comes over a year after the 2013 Westgate shopping center killing, which left 68 people dead in Nairobi. The Somali Islamist group al-Shabaab has claimed responsibility for both attacks.

As the country tried to make sense of the attack, a Kenyan woman named Ory Okolloh created a hashtag on Twitter: #147notjustanumber. The number of victims was still being counted when the hashtag was launched.

She told the WSJ via direct message on Twitter that the hashtag was “an effort to humanize victims of terror.”

We will name them. One by one. They are these "young Africans" we speak of all the time. Chasing dreams. #147notjustanumber — Ory Okolloh Mwangi (@kenyanpundit) April 4, 2015

Tom Vandenbosch, who lives near Brussels, Belgium, used the hashtag to share thoughts and images of students who were killed.

He did not know any students personally, but he lived for in Kenya for 10 years and says he still has many friends there.

“I am just trying to do my bit by humanising the number,” he said via Twitter direct message. “The young people who were killed all had names, faces, friends, family, dreams and aspirations.”

Other Twitter users have used the hashtag to share thoughts and images of people the Twitter users said were victims of the attacks.

They left footprints in our memories and our hearts. They left us too soon. We will forever remember their sacrifice. #147notjustanumber — Ken (@MeBeingKenyan) April 4, 2015

The hashtag #147notjustanumber has been used over 14,000 times since Saturday, according to the social media analytics site, Topsy.com.

The use of hashtags to organize discussion on Twitter has become a common practice in the wake of tragic events: #BlackLivesMatter, #IllRidewithyou and #YesAllWomen are examples of social media conversations in recent years.
