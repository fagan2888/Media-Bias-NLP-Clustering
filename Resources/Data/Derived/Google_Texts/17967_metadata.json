Dennis Daugaard speaking at the State of the State address on Tuesday, Jan. 13, 2015 in Pierre. (Photo: AP)\n\nAn advisor to Gov. Dennis Daugaard says a plan to expand Medicaid in South Dakota earned an initial \u201cgo ahead\u201d Tuesday from a top federal health administrator.\n\nDaugaard\u2019s Senior Advisor Kim Malsam-Rysdon said the governor felt confident about the potential for expansion after meeting with U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Sylvia Burwell in Washington.\n\n\u201cSecretary Burwell expressed an openness to consider some of the options we\u2019re looking at,\u201d Malsam-Rysdon said in a phone interview from Washington. \u201cHer staff will continue to work on the specifics of what they can do at the federal level.\u201d\n\nDetails of the proposal have not been made public, but the governor\u2019s office has said it would extend the program eligibility to 48,500 additional South Dakota residents.\n\nThe expansion could cost the state between $30 and $33 million a year beginning in 2020, Malsam-Rysdon said. She said Daugaard\u2019s chief concern at this time is determining how much state funding the expansion would require.\n\nMedicaid is a jointly funded federal and state health insurance program for needy people. The Affordable Care Act offered incentives for states to expand Medicaid to residents earning up to 133 percent of poverty, which is $15,521 for an individual or $31,721 for a family of four.\n\nSouth Dakota initial balked at the plan, citing potential costs to the state. In 2014, federal officials quashed a proposal that would have partially expanded coverage in South Dakota, covering residents earning up to 100 percent of poverty. That came out to about $11,670 for an individual or $23,850 for a family of four.\n\nAbout 26,000 South Dakotans earn less than 100 percent of the poverty line. Another 22,000 uninsured South Dakotans are between 100 percent to 133 percent of the poverty line.\n\nNational Press Secretary Ben Wakana confirmed the federal government\u2019s desire to partner with the state on expanding access to the program.\n\n\u201cThe administration is willing to work with any state interested in expanding Medicaid,\u201d Wakana said in a statement.\n\nWakana said the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services are working to update guidance over the program\u2019s policy so that they could make 100 percent of federal Medicaid reimbursement funds available to be used for health care in Native American communities.\n\nThe plan is still in its early stages, Malsam-Rysdon said. The state\u2019s tribes, Indian Health Service and others must still be consulted before it could take effect.\n\nDr. Tim Ridgway, president of the South Dakota State Medical Association, Tuesday said the association applauded Daugaard for being open-minded to the expansion. Some Republicans have resisted expansion of the program.\n\n\u201cIt is a budget issue, but it\u2019s more than that. It\u2019s a broad issue, it\u2019s a human issue,\u201d Ridgway said. \u201cMedicaid expansion for the state of South Dakota would mean a healthier South Dakota.\u201d\n\nFollow Dana Ferguson on Twitter @bydanaferguson\n\nRead or Share this story: http://argusne.ws/1FCzGUR", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services indicates she\u2019ll take up SD program expansion", "og": {"site_name": "Argus Leader", "description": "U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services indicates she\u2019ll take up SD program expansion", "title": "Medicaid expansion plan gets initial \u2018go ahead\u2019 in D.C.", "url": "http://www.argusleader.com/story/news/2015/09/29/medicaid-expansion-plan-gets-initial-go-ahead-dc/73067220/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/argusleader.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services indicates she\u2019ll take up SD program expansion", "title": "Medicaid expansion plan gets initial \u2018go ahead\u2019 in D.C.", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/20b76c0d2a02af7ed6565fa1a244e51146ab6253/c=720-0-3568-2848&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/09/29/SiouxFalls/B9319056146Z.1_20150929225613_000_G8LC3CAEC.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@argusleader", "site": "@argusleader", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=823665884", "fb": {"app_id": 174484999248444}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/bydanaferguson/?fref=ts"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "Dennis Daugaard says a plan to expand Medicaid in South Dakota earned an initial \u201cgo ahead\u201d Tuesday from a top federal health administrator.\n\u201cMedicaid expansion for the state of South Dakota would mean a healthier South Dakota.\u201dFollow Dana Ferguson on Twitter @bydanafergusonRead or Share this story: http://argusne.ws/1FCzGUR\nDr. Tim Ridgway, president of the South Dakota State Medical Association, Tuesday said the association applauded Daugaard for being open-minded to the expansion.\nSouth Dakota initial balked at the plan, citing potential costs to the state.\nSouth Dakota Gov."}
