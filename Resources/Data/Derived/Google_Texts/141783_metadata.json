The answer is yes, and a large literature establishes this, but the debate still rages on, driven partially by the cognitive biases of elite commentators. In a recent study, Erik Peterson shed some light on the debate using a random event that could shift an individual\u2019s political preferences: winning the lottery.\n\nIn his study, Erik Peterson examined how winning the lottery affected 1,900 registered voters. His work follows in the vein of recent research by Nattavudh Powdthavee and Andrew J. Oswald, who find that \u201c[lottery] winners tend to switch towards support for a right-wing political party and to become less egalitarian. The larger the win, the more people tilt to the right.\u201d Lottery winners were also more likely to express sympathy for the current distribution of income and wealth. Earlier work by Daniel Doherty, Alan S. Gerber and Donald P. Green suggests that lottery winners were more likely to express opposition to estate taxes and redistribution.\n\nUnlike their work, Peterson eschews surveys, instead using data from the lottery winners\u2019 voter files. In particular, he finds that lottery winners are more likely to become registered Republicans. The effect was modest for those who were registered before winning the lottery, but was more dramatic for those who had not been registered before. Thus: More money increases Republican identification.\n\nAs the data below (from the American National Elections Studies) suggest, the rich tend to be far more conservative than the average American and are far more likely to vote Republican. In a recent study, Nolan McCarty, Keith Poole and Howard Rosenthal find that between 1956 and 1996, \u201cpartisanship has become more stratified by income.\u201d The ANES data also include conservative and liberal self-identification, and here again, those in the highest percentile are more conservative than others (21 percent of the poorest reported being conservative in 2008, compared to 59 percent in 2008).\n\nThe rich are also far more likely to favor cutting services and spending (on a seven-point scale) than increasing services.\n\nIf the rich tend to be more conservative, why do so many influential journalists \u2014 like for example The New York Times\u2019 David Brooks \u2014 argue that they aren\u2019t? Some of the answer is misinformation. Republicans are trying to shed their reputation as the party of the rich, so many seize on scant evidence \u2014 like the fact that some exit polls showed that those earning more than $200,000 skewed toward Obama in 2008 \u2014 to make the case that in fact, the rich are more liberal. But even if commentators are not motivated by politics, there are two other factors at work:\n\nFirst, the rich do tend to be more socially liberal than the poor and middle class, but with an important caveat. In one study, Benjamin Page and Cari Lynn Hennessy use the General Social Survey to examine the views of the richest 4 percent of the country. They find that the top 4 percent are \u201cmuch more socially liberal or libertarian, and more economically conservative, than those of the average American.\u201d Further, they find that these views are distinct from the top third of the income distribution. Thus, on a comprehensive metric of partisanship, the wealthy will appear more centrist because of their views on social issues. However, Stephen Ansolabehere, Jonathan Rodden and James M. Snyder Jr. find that \u201ceconomic policy preferences are more important than moral policy preferences in accounting for voting behavior and party identification.\u201d When David Brooks or other journalists note the social liberalism of the rich as evidence that they are Democratic, they are ignoring the economic issues that drive votes.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new study sheds light on just how large an impact money has on political affiliation", "title": "The GOP\u2019s lottery-ticket philosophy: How extreme wealth is deranging American politics", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "A new study sheds light on just how large an impact money has on political affiliation", "title": "The GOP\u2019s lottery-ticket philosophy: How extreme wealth is deranging American politics", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/04/04/the_gops_lottery_ticket_philosophy_how_extreme_wealth_is_deranging_american_politics/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/koch_romney_trump_lottery_tickets.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A new study sheds light on just how large an impact money has on political affiliation", "title": "The GOP\u2019s lottery-ticket philosophy: How extreme wealth is deranging American politics", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/koch_romney_trump_lottery_tickets.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sean McElwee", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 1 percent, Editor's Picks, GOP, Income inequality, Lottery, Republican Party, Wealth inequality", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbfae\"", "article_summary": "Unlike their work, Peterson eschews surveys, instead using data from the lottery winners\u2019 voter files.\nTopics: 1 percent, Editor's Picks, GOP, Income inequality, Lottery, Republican Party, Wealth inequality, Politics NewsIt\u2019s a long-running debate: Are rich people more conservative, and particularly more likely to be Republican?\nThe larger the win, the more people tilt to the right.\u201d Lottery winners were also more likely to express sympathy for the current distribution of income and wealth.\nIn particular, he finds that lottery winners are more likely to become registered Republicans.\nEarlier work by Daniel Doherty, Alan S.
