And the Obama administration has likewise been dismissive, issuing guidance to its immigration agents telling them not to pursue deportation cases involving illegal immigrants who broke Arizona\u2019s identity laws.\n\nSheriff Arpaio\u2019s criminal employment unit had been controversial, with immigrant-rights advocates saying it struck fear into illegal immigrants who were trying to gain jobs and live.\n\nThe Associated Press reported that Sheriff Arpaio\u2019s office has raided 83 businesses and charged more than 700 immigrants with using fake or stolen identity.\n\nHis lawyers, though, told a federal court he was ending it, as he tried to head off a challenge by several self-identified illegal immigrants to the constitutionality of the state laws.\n\n\u201cMCSO no longer enforces [the statutes] and disbanded the criminal employment unit, the squad charged with investigating cases,\u201d the sheriff\u2019s lawyer said.\n\nPuente Arizona, one of the groups that sued to stop the sheriff, said it was a victory. But the plaintiffs also said they will pursue their case in order to try to strike down the law.\n\n\u201cThis could not have been possible if not for the courage of undocumented workers who came forward to challenge the workplace raids. The community targeted by Arpaio\u2019s war of attrition is turning the tables on the sheriff,\u201d said Carlos Garcia, an official with Puente Arizona.\n\nSheriff Arpaio told the federal court that since he\u2019s no longer enforcing the ID theft laws, the plaintiffs have no standing to sue.\n\nMeanwhile, in his own case against the president\u2019s new amnesty, it\u2019s the Obama administration who argues Sheriff Arpaio has no standing to sue. The sheriff says he will have to spend more money enforcing laws because more illegal immigrants will come into the U.S. in response to the president\u2019s policy, but the administration says that\u2019s speculative and the sheriff can\u2019t prove an actual harm.\n\nThat case is pending in federal court in Washington, D.C. Both sides are due in court on Monday to argue over Sheriff Arpaio\u2019s request for an injunction to halt the president from beginning to carry out his policy.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sheriff Joe Arpaio told a federal court in Arizona last Wednesday that he has disbanded his criminal employment unit and will stop enforcing Arizona's identity theft laws against illegal immigrants, in a move that Hispanic advocacy groups said was a major victory for them.", "Author": "Stephen Dinan", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Sheriff Joe Arpaio told a federal court in Arizona last Wednesday that he has disbanded his criminal employment unit and will stop enforcing Arizona\u2019s identity theft laws against illegal immigrants, in a move that Hispanic advocacy groups said was a major victory for them.", "title": "Sheriff Arpaio disbands illegal immigration ID fraud unit", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/dec/18/sheriff-arpaio-disbands-illegal-immigration-id-fra/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/18/arizona-sheriff-immigration-enforcementjpeg-0d91e.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/18/arizona-sheriff-immigration-enforcementjpeg-0d91e.jpg", "title": "Sheriff Arpaio disbands illegal immigration ID fraud unit", "description": "Sheriff Joe Arpaio told a federal court in Arizona last Wednesday that he has disbanded his criminal employment unit and will stop enforcing Arizona's identity theft laws against illegal immigrants, i", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Law Crime, Politics, Social Issues, Joe Arpaio, Barack Obama"}, "article_summary": "Meanwhile, in his own case against the president\u2019s new amnesty, it\u2019s the Obama administration who argues Sheriff Arpaio has no standing to sue.\nSheriff Arpaio told the federal court that since he\u2019s no longer enforcing the ID theft laws, the plaintiffs have no standing to sue.\nSheriff Arpaio\u2019s criminal employment unit had been controversial, with immigrant-rights advocates saying it struck fear into illegal immigrants who were trying to gain jobs and live.\nImmigrant-rights groups have sued to try to overturn the Arizona identity laws, arguing they are unconstitutional.\nAnd the Obama administration has likewise been dismissive, issuing guidance to its immigration agents telling them not to pursue deportation cases involving illegal immigrants who broke Arizona\u2019s identity laws."}
