Scott Applewhite / AP Senator Ted Cruz emerges from the Senate Chamber after his overnight crusade railing against the nation's new health care law at the Capitol in Washington, Sept. 25, 2013.\n\nTexas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz made his late-night debut on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno on Friday, reaffirming his stance against President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act and gay marriage.\n\nCruz said Obamacare is hurting residents in Texas \u2014 despite the fact that 25% of the state\u2019s residents don\u2019t have health insurance \u2014 killing jobs and forcing insured individuals to drop their health insurance programs.\n\nLeno also pressed Cruz on gay marriage, asking the Texas politician why he was against it.\n\n\u201cI support marriage between one man and one woman, but I also think it\u2019s a question for the states. Some states have made decisions one way on gay marriage; some states have made decisions the other way,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the great thing about our Constitution, is different states can make decisions depending on the values of their citizens.\u201d\n\nLeno also asked about Cruz\u2019s father, Pastor Rafael Cruz, who was recently in the news for making anti-gay comments.\n\nCruz called his father \u201ca man of deep integrity,\u201d adding, \u201cSome folks have decided to try to go after him because they want to take some shots at me. But I think the critics are better off attacking me.\u201d\n\n[NBC News]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Texas Republican Sen.
