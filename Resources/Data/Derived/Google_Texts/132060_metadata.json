Now, the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) has its sights firmly set on conquering the Kurds, a move that would send Iraq and much of the Middle East into chaos.\n\nThe good news is that American airstrikes have helped the Kurds to repel ISIS\u2019 advance. The American assistance allowed Kurdish forces known as the Peshmerga to take back two key towns that ISIS had taken.\n\nRelated: With Iraq in Ruins, ISIS Turns to Genocide\n\nThe bad news is that the fight is far from over. ISIS is wounded but not defeated. The Peshmerga is going to need more than just American airpower if it is to turn back ISIS, which had advanced deep into Kurdistan.\n\nThat\u2019s why an American official told the Associated Press Monday that the White House would begin to supply weapons directly to the Peshmerga. Previously, weapons sent to Kurdistan were funneled through Baghdad. Because the situation in Kurdistan is so dire, the Pentagon will now deal directly with the Kurds.\n\nISIS \u201cobtained some heavy weaponry, and the Kurds need additional arms and we're providing those \u2014 there's nothing new here,\" State Department spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki said Monday, attempting to downplay the move. She added that the Iraqi government \u201chas made deliveries from its own stocks and we are working to do the same.\"\n\nThe decision to directly arm the Kurds comes after their political leader, Massoud Barzani, made an appeal for assistance. He said that without more international help, it would be difficult for the Peshmerga to hold the ground it retook.\n\nRelated: Iraq, Middle East Paying for Obama\u2019s Miscalculation\n\n\u201cWe are not fighting a terrorist organization, we are fighting a terrorist state,\u201d Barzani, president of the Kurdish regional government, said Sunday. \u201cThe weapons they possess are more advanced than what the Peshmerga have.\u201d\n\nA stable Kurdistan is vital to the future of a stable Iraq. Compared with much of the rest of Iraq, Kurdistan has a functioning economy and reliable infrastructure. It also has billions in tapped and untapped oil resources.\n\nRelated: ISIS May Be More Dangerous Than Al Qaeda Ever Was\n\nStability in Kurdistan is not just important for Iraq. It\u2019s also important for Turkey, which shares a border and has a sizable Kurdish population. If ISIS takes Kurdistan, it would be on Turkey\u2019s doorstep. And being on Turkey\u2019s doorstep also means that it\u2019s on Europe\u2019s doorstep, as Turkey is a bridge to the continent. As the group has proven in the past, it\u2019s has ambitions far beyond Iraq and Syria.\n\nThis is why Turkish F-16s have been flying over Kurdistan to monitor ISIS\u2019s advance.\n\n\u201cAs a strategic neighbor, the stability and security of the Kurdistan Region is important to Turkey and to keep that stability Turkey will do whatever falls on its shoulders,\u201d deputy head of Turkey's ruling party Huseyin Celik said last week. \u201cThe Kurds and Turkmen of Iraq are our relatives and now that they are facing difficulties we will not stay silent.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The White House\u2019s decision to directly arm the Kurds shows just how important the region is to Iraq and the wider Middle East.", "title": "If Kurds Fall, Chaos in Iraq and Abroad to Follow", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/08/11/If-Kurds-Fall-Chaos-Iraq-and-Abroad-Follow", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/06292014_Iraqi_Volunteer.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/08/11/If-Kurds-Fall-Chaos-Iraq-and-Abroad-Follow", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/06292014_Iraqi_Volunteer.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@davidcfrancis"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "The White House\u2019s decision to directly arm the Kurds shows just how important the region is to Iraq and the wider Middle East.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde938\"", "article_summary": "Compared with much of the rest of Iraq, Kurdistan has a functioning economy and reliable infrastructure.\nNow, the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) has its sights firmly set on conquering the Kurds, a move that would send Iraq and much of the Middle East into chaos.\nRelated: With Iraq in Ruins, ISIS Turns to GenocideThe bad news is that the fight is far from over.\nThe good news is that American airstrikes have helped the Kurds to repel ISIS\u2019 advance.\n\u201cThe Kurds and Turkmen of Iraq are our relatives and now that they are facing difficulties we will not stay silent.\u201dTop Reads from The Fiscal Times"}
