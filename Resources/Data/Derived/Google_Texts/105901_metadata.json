I\u2019m pretty sure we want to go ahead and look at that. That\u2019s not many rooftops, if any.\u201d\n\nSlaughter said it would be advantageous for the study to look at more areas than the city is sure it wants to annex.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not annexing one square inch if you commission me and my firm to conduct this study until you adopt an annexation ordinance,\u201d Slaughter said. \u201cI recommend from a pure planning standpoint, the earlier a city includes potential growth areas in the city, the better, because if they develop under substandard ordinances, regulations, water, sewer, drainage, street design, you\u2019re going to inherit a problem if you ever annex it.\u201d\n\nSeveral city officials voiced an understanding the city is required to extend full utility service to any annexed area within five years, but Slaughter said that is not accurate.\n\n\u201cWe may have a large enough area here where it could impact your public works department, your police department, maybe your fire department. We want to make sure we don\u2019t have a negative impact on that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll calculate where we may need to extend water and sewer. There\u2019s no requirement that says we\u2019ve got to run water and sewer everywhere within the first five years.\u201d\n\nSlaughter said utility extension could be offered to the court in two phases.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll tell the court, in the Phase 1 area, \u2018This is where we promise we\u2019re going to put water and sewer in during the first five years,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cFor the more rural areas in Phase 2, we say, \u2018Water and sewer may or may not go in during the first five years, depending on where development warrants it, it\u2019s necessary and it\u2019s economically feasible to do so.\u2019\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to run it like a business, just like you do today.\u201d\n\nerrol.castens@journalinc.com\n\nTwitter: @oxfordcitizenec", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal", "description": "By Errol Castens Oxford Citizen OXFORD \u2013 City of Oxford officials will consider on Tuesday a contract to conduct the city\u2019s next annexation study, which could include several areas of the city including land along the planned extension of West Oxford Loop, among others.
