Reuters has reviewed Mr Trump's website, speeches, debates and televised interviews to compile his likely manifesto on everything from trade to healthcare.\n\n1. Torture is back on the table\n\nThe presidential hopeful has vowed to bring back waterboarding, an interrogation technique which has been banned as torture in the US. It simulates drowning.\n\nHe has promised to bring in other forms of toruture that are \"a hell of a lot worse\" than waterboarding, too.\n\n2. Gulf states will be made to pay for a \"safe zone\" for Syrians in the Middle East\n\nHe wants to build a \"safe zone\" for Syrian refugees in Syria. But Gulf states would have to pay for it.\n\nHe has said the United States should first deal with Isis before addressing President Bashar al-Assad's future, saying: \"We have to do one thing at a time.\"\n\n3. Pharmaceuticals companies should be afraid\n\nMr Trump has claimed he could save the government $300 billion by negotiating better prices with drug companies, interestingly.\n\nHe has not said exactly how.\n\n4. Corporate tax would be reduced to 15 per cent instead of 35 per cent\n\nMr Trump would cut corporate tax by more than half. He would also reduce the number of tax brackets to four, instead of seven, and only allow a top marginal tax rate of 25 per cent.\n\nWhile he said the plan is fully worked out, the Tax Foundation, an independent policy research group, has said it would cost more than $10 trillion over the next decade.\n\n5. No one would be \"ripping off\" the US\n\nMr Trump claims he would let countries know that it does not pay to snub US exports, or move out of the country and try to sell exports back into it.\n\nSo he intends, for example, to place a 35 per cent tarrif on one company that makes air conditioners which decided to move to Mexico instead of being in the US.\n\nHe wants to do the same to Ford Motor Corp, for the same reason but because of motor vehicles this time.\n\nAnd he would designate China a \"currency manipulator\" and put duties on its exports \u2013 as well chase up a World Trade Orgnisation cause looking at the Chinese government subsidising exporters.\n\nHe has also complained that Japan, Vietnam and India are keeping out some US exports.\n\n6. The Education Department would be cut\n\nThe man who recently said he \"loved the poorly educated because we're smart and we're loyal\" wants to try to reduce the country's \u00a319 trillion deficit with cuts to education.\n\nHe would cut the Environmental Protection Agency for the same reason.\n\n7. Obamacare is out\n\nSenior citizens and low income Americans would still get Medicaid and Medicare. Older people would also retain Social Security retirement benefits.\n\nBut the rest of the Affordable Care Act would be out, with a health savings account system being put in place instead.\n\nYet he would still make insurers give coverage to people with preexisting medical conditions, which was a central tenet of Obamacare.\n\n8. Not even a green card will help you get work in the US\n\nMr Trump would end \"birthright citizenship\" for children born in the United States to illegal immigrants \u2013 and deport the 11 million undocumented people living in America.\n\nThis is despite the controversy over his reported use of illegal Polish workers with no social security or regular pay cheques when constructing Trump Tower more than 30 years ago.\n\nHe would also \"pause\" new green cards and make employers offer jobs to US workers first.\n\n9. The Chinese had better watch out\n\nMr Trump would apparently increase the size of the US military to make it \"so strong, so powerful that nobody's going to mess with us.\"\n\nTo that end, he would boost the US military presence in the East and South China seas to \"discourage Chinese adventurism,\" according to his website.\n\nThere are 250 days, or 35 weeks, to the presidential election yet to go.", "article_metadata": {"description": "After winning more than a third of the Republican vote across seven states on so-called Super Tuesday, Donald Trump's hopes for the White House are fast becoming more like workable plans.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "The Independent", "description": "After winning more than a third of the Republican vote across seven states on so-called Super Tuesday, Donald Trump's hopes for the White House are fast becoming more like workable plans.", "title": "9 things President Donald Trump would do, according to Donald Trump", "url": "http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-elections/donald-trump-us-elections-what-president-donald-trump-would-do-according-to-him-a6907241.html", "image": "http://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2016/02/27/15/Donald_Trump_Getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-03-03T10:57:39+00:00", "locale": "en_GB", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-elections/donald-trump-us-elections-what-president-donald-trump-would-do-according-to-him-a6907241.html", "site": "@independent", "description": "After winning more than a third of the Republican vote across seven states on so-called Super Tuesday, Donald Trump's hopes for the White House are fast becoming more like workable plans.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "US elections: 9 things President Donald Trump would do according to him"}, "drupal_parsely_version": "0.1", "fb": {"admins": 729735830, "app_id": 235586169789578}, "keywords": "Donald Trump, US election 2016, Republican Party, US elections, Americas, World, News", "article": {"video_count": 0, "published_time": "2016-03-02T13:25:57+00:00", "section": "US elections", "embed_count": 0, "author_name": "Jess Staufenberg", "tag": "Republican Party", "word_count": 797, "content_type": "story", "internal_link_count": 6, "image_count": 1, "subsection": "News Videos", "modified_time": "2016-03-03T10:57:39+00:00", "external_link_count": 1}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "So he intends, for example, to place a 35 per cent tarrif on one company that makes air conditioners which decided to move to Mexico instead of being in the US.\nCorporate tax would be reduced to 15 per cent instead of 35 per centMr Trump would cut corporate tax by more than half.\nPharmaceuticals companies should be afraidMr Trump has claimed he could save the government $300 billion by negotiating better prices with drug companies, interestingly.\nReuters has reviewed Mr Trump's website, speeches, debates and televised interviews to compile his likely manifesto on everything from trade to healthcare.\nTo that end, he would boost the US military presence in the East and South China seas to \"discourage Chinese adventurism,\" according to his website."}
