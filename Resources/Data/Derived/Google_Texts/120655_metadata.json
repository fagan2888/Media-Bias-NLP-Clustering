Under the fast-track procedures, they just need a majority of 51 senators, and they hold 54 seats in the chamber.\n\nBut the pro-life groups say three Republicans who have wavered on defunding Planned Parenthood, namely Sens. Susan M. Collins of Maine, Mark Kirk of Illinois and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, can\u2019t be counted on when the vote comes.\n\nMeanwhile, three conservatives \u2014 Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida, Ted Cruz of Texas and Mike Lee of Utah \u2014 have said they want to see a bigger strike at Obamacare. Their recalcitrance, combined with that of the three others wary of the Planned Parenthood issue, could sink the entire effort.\n\nWith Mr. Rubio and Mr. Cruz running for the White House, however, pro-life groups are casting the vote as a test of leadership.\n\n\u201cWe are confident that all 51 pro-life senators will come together to defund Planned Parenthood and build consensus on gutting Obamacare,\u201d said Mallory Quigley, spokeswoman for the Susan B. Anthony List, one of the pro-life groups that is exerting pressure, along with the Family Research Council.\n\nRepublican aides said the bill will make it to the floor as soon as this week as leadership tries to lock down votes in each corner of the caucus.\n\n\u201cSince all of our members support Obamacare repeal, we\u2019re talking with all of them,\u201d said Donald Stewart, spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican.\n\nThe bill, which uses a budget procedure known as \u201creconciliation\u201d to avoid a Democratic filibuster, also faces technical hurdles. Top Democrats say the Senate\u2019s referee \u2014 the parliamentarian \u2014 found that repealing Obamacare\u2019s insurance mandates on individuals and employers would only have incidental budgetary effects, which puts that language in violation of the Budget Act.\n\nSenate Republicans say they are working on a fix.\n\nStill, the alliance of Messrs. Cruz, Rubio and Lee shows no signs of cracking. They have said they can\u2019t vote for legislation unless it repeals every word of Obamacare.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, who is also seeking the Republican presidential nomination, will vote \u201cno.\u201d\n\nConservative groups pushing for full repeal of Obamacare say leaders should have tried to defund Planned Parenthood as part of must-pass spending legislation instead of lumping it into the reconciliation bill.\n\n\u201cRepublican leaders used this opportunity to turn two important conservative policy priorities into competing agendas and divide the conservative movement. This is leadership-orchestrated conservative sectarianism at its very worst,\u201d Michael A. Needham, CEO of the political arm of the conservative Heritage Foundation, wrote in a recent op-ed for Breitbart.com.\n\n\u201cReconciliation isn\u2019t a test for President Rubio or President Cruz,\u201d he said, \u201cit is a test for the conservative movement and one our nation cannot afford for us to fail.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Senate GOP leaders face a major test over the next two weeks in trying to round up enough Republicans to back a bill that would gut Obamacare and strip funding from Planned Parenthood &mdash; but they're caught in a tug-of-war between powerful conservative lobbies who view the issues in very different ways.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Senate GOP leaders face a major test over the next two weeks in trying to round up enough Republicans to back a bill that would gut Obamacare and strip funding from Planned Parenthood \u2014 but they\u2019re caught in a tug-of-war between powerful conservative lobbies who view the issues in very different ways.", "title": "Bill to gut Obamacare, defund Planned Parenthood threatened by warring conservative lobbies", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/nov/29/bill-to-gut-obamacare-defund-planned-parenthood-th/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/11/29/CruzRubioLee.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/11/29/CruzRubioLee.jpg", "description": "Senate GOP leaders face a major test over the next two weeks in trying to round up enough Republicans to back a bill that would gut Obamacare and strip funding from Planned Parenthood &mdash; but they", "card": "summary", "title": "Bill to gut Obamacare, defund Planned Parenthood threatened by warring"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Heritage Foundation"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3aca\"", "article_summary": "Their recalcitrance, combined with that of the three others wary of the Planned Parenthood issue, could sink the entire effort.\nBut the pro-life groups say three Republicans who have wavered on defunding Planned Parenthood, namely Sens.\n\u201cRepublican leaders used this opportunity to turn two important conservative policy priorities into competing agendas and divide the conservative movement.\nWith Mr. Rubio and Mr. Cruz running for the White House, however, pro-life groups are casting the vote as a test of leadership.\nThe bill, which uses a budget procedure known as \u201creconciliation\u201d to avoid a Democratic filibuster, also faces technical hurdles."}
