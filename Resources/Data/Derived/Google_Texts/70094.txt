Limited access to restricted areas in the Big Thompson Canyon, served by highways U.S. 34 and 36, will be allowed Sunday afternoon.

Areas heavily damaged by flooding include Waltonia, Drake and addresses below 2300 Big Thompson Canyon, according to the Larimer County Sheriff’s Office.

Residents and workers hired by residents, including insurance adjusters, plumbers, electricians, other construction workers and tow truck drivers, will be allowed into restricted areas from noon Sunday until 5 p.m., according to the sheriff’s office.

Residents will have to accompany workers and volunteers.

Any drivers entering the areas will have to use four-wheel-drive vehicles.

On U.S. 36, the National Guard and the state Department of Transportation have built a “primitive road” connecting Lyons to Estes Park. The road, which provides access to Pinewood Springs, can be used by area residents only. It is not a way for visitors to access Estes Park.
