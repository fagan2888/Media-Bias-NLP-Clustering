The savings come from using research firm LexisNexis\u2019 giant database to verify the identities on state income tax returns. By spotting false or stolen identities, the state can determine which returns are concocted and block the fake refunds.\n\nThe Indiana Department of Revenue\u2019s identity-matching effort is indicative of the types of data-driven programs most states have undertaken to combat an exploding number of sham tax refund filings, false Medicaid and unemployment claims and public assistance fraud that can cost taxpayers billions of dollars.\n\nRelated: How Big Data Can Stop Traffic Jams and More\n\nIndiana\u2019s results are proof that using data has a payoff. And they provide a tantalizing glimpse of the cost-savings states could get from applying a government-wide \u201cbig data\u201d approach to combatting the fraudulent claims states face in an Internet age when identity theft is rampant. Indiana spotted 74,782 returns filed with stolen or manufactured identities as of the end of last month with its new identity-matching effort. Without it, the Department of Revenue caught just 1,500 cases of identity theft out of more than 3 million returns filed in all of 2013.\n\nOther Indiana agencies are mining data, matching data sets and performing some data analysis to detect fraud, said Matthew Donahue, the Revenue Department\u2019s leader of strategic transformation initiatives. But, he said, there\u2019s no state government-wide data sharing, combination of databases or use of data analysis across them to attack fraud in a big data way. That\u2019s true in nearly all the states, said Doug Robinson, executive director of the National Association of State Chief Information Officers.\n\nDespite the vast databases of personal, business and other information that states possess, Robinson said, only a few states are starting to leverage them in a strategic, big data way to detect and prevent fraud\u2014or to apply them to other pressing management, economic or social problems states face.\n\nRelated: Big Data Poses Big Challenges for the Pentagon\n\nInstead, he said, states largely house their databases separately in tax, health, revenue, welfare, motor vehicles, voter registration and professional licensing departments and offices. Other agencies cannot easily access the data, which is often not in the same format. Thus, it cannot be quickly managed, matched, mined or otherwise analyzed in an enterprising fashion to catch and prevent fraud or attack other problems.\n\n\u201cStates are data engines at their core,\u201d Robinson said. But, he said, \u201cjust because states have a lot of data doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ve met the definition of big data. \u2026 Very few states have taken an enterprise approach to it.\u201d\n\nStates Hit With \u2018Widespread Fraud\u2019\n\nIf famed bank robber Willie Sutton were alive today, he might well be an identity thief\u2014after all, that\u2019s where the money is. And instead of looking to banks, he\u2019d look to states.\n\n\u201cIf government is giving out a benefit or a payment \u2026 then they are being defrauded in enormous ways,\u201d said Andy Bucholz, vice president of market planning for LexisNexis Risk Solutions, which Indiana contracted with to verify identities on tax returns. \u201cThis is widespread. Nobody knows the true costs yet. A lot of government agencies don\u2019t want to raise their hands and say we\u2019ve been defrauded.\u201d (See an interactive map on the percentage of complaints of identity theft involving public documents and benefits reported in your state last year.)\n\nRelated: Museums See Big Data As Profitable New Art Form\n\nThe cost to states likely has run into the billions of dollars in recent years as states have moved services online and as identity theft has exploded nationally, Bucholz said. It\u2019s hard to tell in online filings if people really are who they say they are.\n\nIdentity thieves lift personal information, such as dates of birth, Social Security numbers, addresses and bank account numbers, everywhere from doctor\u2019s offices to Internet hacking, and use it to try to bilk state programs by making bogus claims, Bucholz said.\n\nLike Indiana, many states increasingly have taken action against the scams and other improper payments by using identity verification and other data tools, especially in claims for unemployment insurance benefits:\n\nBy matching unemployment claims against the identities of people jailed in country prisons, Pennsylvania discovered and stopped almost 19,000 payments made in 2013 to inmates who can\u2019t lawfully collect the benefits. The state estimates the program will save taxpayers about $100 million a year.\n\nNew Mexico cut unemployment insurance fraud by about $10 million, or 60 percent, last year after integrating its unemployment tax and claims systems. The new system lets the state quickly match documentation between employers and claimants to reduce fraud, and to detect and recover improper payments.\n\nNew Jersey has blocked nearly $450 million in improper unemployment payments the last four years, as Stateline has reported, by identifying 300,000 people who tried to wrongfully collect benefits through identity theft or other schemes or mistakes.\n\n\n\n\n\nFlorida has taken an aggressive approach to rooting out fraudulent or improper claims for food stamps, cash assistance for needy families and Medicaid by verifying claimants are who they say they are with the LexisNexis identity database before issuing payments.\n\nRelated: You May Be One of Millions Whose ID Was Stolen and Sold\n\nThe state kept $32.8 million in inappropriate payments \u201cfrom going out the door\u201d in its last fiscal year that ended June 30, said Andrew McClenahan, director of public benefits integrity for Florida\u2019s Department of Children and Families. It also detected $34.4 million in overpayments and recovered more than $19.4 million of that money.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want it to appear as if we\u2019re waging a war on the poor and unfortunate,\u201d McClenahan said of attacking public assistance fraud. But, he said, it\u2019s \u201cone of the things we have to do as stewards of taxpayers\u2019 money.\u201d\n\nNew York\u2019s Department of Taxation and Finance has expanded its program to prevent and track down tax cheats in recent years. It now uses data screening and analytics to review the 10 million personal income tax returns it receives each year. Last year, it spotted more than 255,000 inappropriate refunds and kept $413 million from being paid. Some states are taking the experience they\u2019ve gained in one agency and applying it to others. After launching a program to recover improper unemployment insurance payments, Michigan began using data analytics software to look for anomalies or patterns that suggest fraud in other areas, such as its Food Assistance Program.\n\nFew States Employ \u2018Big Data\u2019\n\nTo integrate its data and leverage the information across all of state government, North Carolina has consolidated its data analytics efforts, including its data-based fraud detection program, under its Office of Information Technology Services. The goal is to apply big data-style analytics across all agencies to improve business decisions.\n\nRelated: How You're Shaping the Future Through Big Data\n\nFew states, according to a survey of the states\u2019 chief information officers released in September, have big data projects underway. Only 13.7 percent have a big data project that involves several agencies. One in five states has no big data project going at all.\n\nIndiana is an exception, but its big data project isn\u2019t focused on fraud. Instead, it aims to assess why Indiana has a high infant mortality rate compared to the national average. Data from various agencies\u2014health, criminal justice, social services and the environment\u2014will be analyzed for causes of the high mortality so the state can respond with the right policies and programs. It\u2019s the first project undertaken by Indiana\u2019s new Management and Performance Hub, created by Republican Gov. Mike Pence to share data, take on the state\u2019s toughest challenges and produce better results.\n\nIn trying to take a big data approach to problems, states face hurdles beyond getting disparate data out of agency silos and making it compatible. Some data, such as voter registrations, reside in separate state constitutional offices, which poses a jurisdictional problem. And there are privacy concerns.\n\nMost states use third-party software or services offered by a host of private companies to analyze and apply their data to a task, just as Indiana\u2019s Department of Revenue uses LexisNexis to authenticate identities. Indiana doesn\u2019t send LexisNexis tax returns. Instead, it sends portions of information from returns that LexisNexis compares to its identity database, which is pulled from public and commercial records and is one of the largest in the world. The state also sends questions to taxpayers that only the real tax filer can answer.\n\nRelated: States Turn to Cloud Computing for Cost Savings\n\nIndiana\u2019s Donahue said its identity verification program is just a first step in combating tax fraud. The Department is developing predictive analytics to try to spot patterns or anomalies in returns to try to stay ahead of the crooks, who still are filing bogus refunds six months after the flurry of tax season. \u201cWe have to be flexible,\u201d he said. \u201cThe crooks are adapting and changing.\u201d What Donahue won\u2019t be able to bring to bear on the crooks, at least not yet, are data sets from across all Indiana agencies. But maybe down the line, now that the state\u2019s new Management and Performance Hub is knocking down data silos, he will.\n\nThis article originally appeared in Stateline, a nonpartisan, nonprofit news service of the Pew Center on the States that provides daily reporting and analysis on trends in state policy.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/11/20/States-Have-Great-New-Weapon-Against-Fraud-Big-Data", "site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02172012_Binary_Computers_article.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "States Have a Great New Weapon Against Fraud: Big Data"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/11/20/States-Have-Great-New-Weapon-Against-Fraud-Big-Data", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02172012_Binary_Computers_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfced\"", "article_summary": "Related: How Big Data Can Stop Traffic Jams and MoreIndiana\u2019s results are proof that using data has a payoff.\nBut, he said, \u201cjust because states have a lot of data doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ve met the definition of big data.\nBut, he said, there\u2019s no state government-wide data sharing, combination of databases or use of data analysis across them to attack fraud in a big data way.\nRelated: How You're Shaping the Future Through Big DataFew states, according to a survey of the states\u2019 chief information officers released in September, have big data projects underway.\nIn trying to take a big data approach to problems, states face hurdles beyond getting disparate data out of agency silos and making it compatible."}
