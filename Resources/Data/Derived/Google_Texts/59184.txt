LOS ANGELES (AP) â€” And the baby du jour's name is ... Saint West.

Kim Kardashian West and hubby Kanye announced the name of their new boy via Twitter and her app. North's sibling was born Saturday, weighing in at 8 pounds, 1 ounce.

Saint is in fine company. His cousins include Reign Aston Disick.

Kardashian West has tracked her pregnancy online for her 37 million Twitter followers, posting an image late Friday of her bare belly with the caption, "Ready whenever you are lol."

North was born in 2013.

Kardashian, 35, and West, 38, were married last year in Florence, Italy, in a gala ceremony filmed for E!'s "Keeping Up With the Kardashians." West proposed to his bride in October 2013, renting out San Francisco's AT&T Park for the occasion.
