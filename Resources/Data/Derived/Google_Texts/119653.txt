Authorities say Kansas State backup defensive tackle Terrell Clinkscales has been arrested on a failure to appear in court warrant and suspicion of witness/victim intimidation.

Riley County Police Sgt. Scott Hajek says officers arrested Clinkscales around 4 a.m. Sunday at an apartment in Manhattan, but he said he couldn't comment further on what led to the arrest. Clinkscales was released on $2,000 bond. Clinkscales didn't immediately respond to an email that The Associated Press sent to his university account.

The Chicago native transferred to Kansas State from Dodge City Community College. In his first season with the Wildcats, the junior has played in seven games and made two tackles.

Kansas State sports information director Kenny Lannou didn't immediately respond to an email or phone message.
