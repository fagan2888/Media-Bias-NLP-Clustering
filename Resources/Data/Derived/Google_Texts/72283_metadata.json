That 2012 triennial review departed from previous rulings that allowed consumers to unlock their cellphones.\n\nThe decision prompted a backlash from consumers, 114,000 of whom signed an online White House petition asking the administration to reverse the decision.\n\nIn the blog post, Zients and Leahy said the cellphone unlocking bill is \u201cthe first time a We the People petition has led to a legislative fix.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe story of how we broke through Washington gridlock to restore the freedom of consumers to take their mobile phone wherever they choose is one worth telling, and a model worth repeating,\u201d they said.\n\nFederal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler \u2014 who pressured wireless companies to agree to unlock customers\u2019 cellphones last year \u2014 praised the bill.\n\n\u201cThis new law is a positive development that addresses the issues that triggered unlocking concerns in the first place,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWhen the wireless industry worked with the FCC on a voluntary agreement to unlock devices when consumers\u2019 contracts have been fulfilled, they took an important step forward. The President\u2019s signature today makes greater consumer choice the law of the land.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Supporters say it's the first time a law was changed because of a White House petition.", "description": "Supporters say it's the first time a law was changed because of a White House petition.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Kate Tummarello", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Supporters say it's the first time a law was changed because of a White House petition.", "title": "Obama signs cellphone unlocking bill", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/214114-obama-signs-cellphone-unlocking-bill", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-02T05:39:37-05:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-02T05:39-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/214114-obama-signs-cellphone-unlocking-bill", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2014-08-01T16:58-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Kate Tummarello", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-01T16:58:27-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-02T05:39:37-05:00"}, "keywords": ",Patrick Leahy,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/214114-obama-signs-cellphone-unlocking-bill", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Supporters say it's the first time a law was changed because of a White House petition.", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama signs cellphone unlocking bill"}, "dcterms.title": "Obama signs cellphone unlocking bill"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf23d\"", "article_summary": "President Obama on Friday signed into law a bill that allows consumers to \u201cunlock\u201d their cellphones and switch wireless companies without giving up their phones.\nThe Unlocking Consumer Choice and Wireless Competition Act will allow consumers to take their cellphones with them when they switch wireless companies.\nFederal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler \u2014 who pressured wireless companies to agree to unlock customers\u2019 cellphones last year \u2014 praised the bill.\nADVERTISEMENTIn a blog post , National Economic Director Jeff Zients and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman(D-Vt.) \u2014 who sponsored the bill in the Senate \u2014 hailed the bill as a victory for consumers.\nThe bill also does not undo the standing ban on \"bulk unlocking.\""}
