They want their store back.\u201d A slew of \u201880s stars such as wrestler Hulk Hogan, Cliff Clavin from \u201cCheers\u201d (actor John Ratzenberger), rappers Kid \u2018n Play and gymnast Mary Lou Retton appear in the store while Loverboy\u2019s 1981 hit \u201cEverybody\u2019s Working for the Weekend\u201d blares in the background.\n\nThe stars of yesteryear proceed to ransack the store and clear its shelves of VCRs, boom boxes and radios. Then they rip out the shelves too. The self-effacing ad ends with a look at a modern Radio Shack store with displays promoting more contemporary tech gear. (Watch the full version of the ad below.)\n\nThe commercial earned kudos from media outlets such as People magazine, Advertising Age and Entertainment Weekly. CNN\u2019s Jeff Pearlman called it \u201cpure commercial genius.\u201d Some observers of the company, though, are less impressed.\n\n\u201cIt was kind of a waste of money,\u201d said Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush, who rates the shares as a sell. \u201cPeople are overly optimistic. Yes, it\u2019s clever but people aren\u2019t going to go out and buy anything\u201d because of it.\n\nThe ad underscores CEO Joe Magnacca\u2019s huge challenges in drawing in new customers, some of whom haven\u2019t gone to a Radio Shack since the Reagan administration, to venture into one of its 4,400 U.S. stores. It won\u2019t be easy.\n\nRelated: Super Bowl XLVIII: Can Celebrities Break Through the Ad Clutter?\n\nFor one thing, Radio Shack has loads more competitors, ranging from Walmart to Best Buy, that weren\u2019t an issue during its heyday. Pachter expects the chain to shutter underperforming stores as it seeks to right its financial ship.\n\nMagnacca, the company\u2019s fourth CEO in about five years, has tried to revive the brand by changing the company\u2019s colors, overhauling the design of its stores and changing its merchandising. Last year, the chain opened a new concept store in Manhattan\u2019s Upper West Side as a showcase for new gadgets made by Apple and Samsung while at the same trying to reduce its dependence on smartphones. None of these efforts has gained much traction. A spokesperson for Radio Shack couldn\u2019t be reached for comment.\n\nRadio Shack shares have tumbled more than 23 percent over the past year, even as the market hit record highs. And despite Monday\u2019s jump, they may have further to fall. The stock is currently trading above analysts\u2019 average 52-week price target of $2.41.\n\nWall Street analysts who follow the company expect it to report an 11-cent per share loss in the December quarter and 30 cents a share during the March period. Revenue is forecast to drop 13.2 percent in the fourth quarter and 3.2 percent in the first. The company, which has suspended its dividend, got loans of about $835 million ahead of the critical holiday season.\n\nThe financing gives Radio Shack some breathing room but the company still isn\u2019t out of the woods financially. Morningstar analyst Liang Feng noted that the stores are \u201cburning cash at a fast pace.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are on a short time line,\u201d said Feng, who dropped coverage of the company last month, in an interview. \u201cThey need to need to convince consumers that they have changed.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, one Super Bowl ad \u2014 as clever as it may be \u2014 can\u2019t undo decades of consumer experiences.\n\nTop Reads From The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "RadioShack scored with its Super Bowl ad, but winning over shoppers will be much harder.", "title": "Was RadioShack\u2019s Funny Super Bowl Ad Just a Giant Waste of Money?", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/02/03/Was-RadioShack-s-Funny-Super-Bowl-Ad-Just-Giant-Waste-Money", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/02042014_Radioshack_Commercial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/02/03/Was-RadioShack-s-Funny-Super-Bowl-Ad-Just-Giant-Waste-Money", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/02042014_Radioshack_Commercial.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "RadioShack scored with its Super Bowl ad, but winning over shoppers will be much harder.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThey need to need to convince consumers that they have changed.\u201dUnfortunately, one Super Bowl ad \u2014 as clever as it may be \u2014 can\u2019t undo decades of consumer experiences.\nIn its ad, Radio Shack used irony and humor to fess up to the long-held perception that it isn\u2019t relevant to modern consumers.\nThe self-effacing ad ends with a look at a modern Radio Shack store with displays promoting more contemporary tech gear.\nRadio Shack shares have tumbled more than 23 percent over the past year, even as the market hit record highs.\nRelated: Super Bowl XLVIII: Can Celebrities Break Through the Ad Clutter?"}
