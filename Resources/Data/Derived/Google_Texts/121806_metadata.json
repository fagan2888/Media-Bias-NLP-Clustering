Bush\u2019s fiscal policies and backed Obama in 2008, contends that a look at Obama\u2019s track record reveals a president who\u2019s basically a liberal Republican of yore. From the beginning of his administration, Bartlett argues, Obama has charted a center-right course on both foreign and domestic policy issues.\n\nPopulating his administration with hawks like Hillary Rodham Clinton, Obama has presided over new military engagements abroad while overseeing a draconian crackdown on national security leaks at home, Bartlett notes.\n\nMeanwhile, Obama has pursued \u201cvery conservative\u201d fiscal policies, Bartlett writes, signing a stimulus package that was far smaller than what experts and advisers like Christina Romer found would be necessary to really prime the nation\u2019s economic pump. Moreover, Obama has conducted himself like a deficit hawk, \u201cproposing much deeper cuts in spending and the deficit than did the Republicans during the 2011 budget negotiations,\u201d when a deal eluded the two parties. And don\u2019t buy into the the GOP \u201charping\u201d that Obama hates business, Bartlett cautions. The president, he says, \u201chas bent over backward to protect corporate profits.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Just look at the president's record, Bartlett says.
