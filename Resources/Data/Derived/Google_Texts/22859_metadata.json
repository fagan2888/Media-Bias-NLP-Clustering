There\u2019s the potential for people to get a lot more of these vitamins than they need.\u201d\n\nOne study analyzed 46 beverages sold in supermarkets alongside bottled water.\n\nIt found many of the drinks contained vitamins B6, B12, niacin and vitamin C in quantities \u201cwell in excess\u201d of average daily requirements for young adults.\n\nParticularly concerning, experts say, is the explosion of beverages marketed for their high levels of antioxidants. The body requires antioxidants to neutralize free radicals that can damage cells and their DNA. But it also uses free radicals to fight off infections and cancer cells, and when antioxidants are present in excess, it can throw things off balance.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very hard to figure out the logic the manufacturers are using to do this fortification,\u201d said Valerie Tarasuk, a nutrition scientist the University of Toronto.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way that the things that are being added are things that anybody needs or stands to benefit from.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Anahad O\u2019Connor, The New York Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2015/02/FASAWA22_6740155.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda211\"", "article_summary": "Q: Is it a good idea to buy sports drinks and bottled water with vitamins and minerals added?\n\u201cYou have vitamins and minerals that occur naturally in foods, and then you have people taking supplements, and then you have all these fortified foods,\u201d said Mridul Datta of Purdue University.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very hard to figure out the logic the manufacturers are using to do this fortification,\u201d said Valerie Tarasuk, a nutrition scientist the University of Toronto.\nIt found many of the drinks contained vitamins B6, B12, niacin and vitamin C in quantities \u201cwell in excess\u201d of average daily requirements for young adults.\nThe body requires antioxidants to neutralize free radicals that can damage cells and their DNA."}
