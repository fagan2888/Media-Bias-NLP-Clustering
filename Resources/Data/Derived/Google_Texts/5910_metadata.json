Technical disasters at the federal health insurance website have kept national enrollment low, while the unexpected cancellation of plans unleashed a public outcry.\n\nBut here in New York, tens of thousands of people like Jovishoff have already signed up for insurance, and many have reason to feel lucky, too.\n\nNew York is one of 16 states that chose to build its own website. While there were problems early on, it has been working ever since.\n\nAccording to the most recent data from NY State of Health, 91,103 people have enrolled in plans and 284,440 have completed applications.\n\nEnrollment has been building in recent weeks and the momentum is expected to continue as we approach Dec. 23, the deadline for purchasing plans that become effective on Jan. 1.\n\nThe costs of plans here are 53% lower than they would be in the individual market, NY State of Health says.\n\n\"We have had overwhelming interest,\" Danielle Holahan, the exchange's deputy director, told the Daily News. \"We are meeting and exceeding our expectations.\"\n\nWhat does that mean to you? If you are uninsured or are unhappy with your health insurance, now is the time to go shopping \u2014 and the Daily News is here to help you along the way.\n\nOur Guide to the Affordable Care Act Part II (Part I can be found at here) will help you understand your new coverage options.\n\nWe'll tell you how to navigate the exchange, tell you what to consider when making a choice, introduce you to some new health insurance companies and clear up some common misconceptions.\n\nFirst, you should know the basics:\n\n-- You must purchase insurance by Mar. 31 or face a penalty of $95 or 1% of your income, whichever is greater.\n\n-- On New York's marketplace, you'll be able to compare plans from 16 insurance companies.\n\n-- If you are an individual earning up to $45,900 a year or a family of four earning up to $94,200 a year, you may be eligible for financial assistance that can dramatically reduce your costs.\n\nFor instance, if a family of four \u2014 two kids and two adults \u2014 living in Brooklyn with an income of $50,000 were to purchase a silver-level plan from MetroPlus, the premiums would be $718 a month. But tax credits would bring the out-of-pocket costs down to $268 a month, according to NY State of Health.\n\n-- Costs are just one consideration. It's important that you do your homework to see if you the health professionals and facilities you like are in the network.\n\n\"These are generally narrow network products,\" said Dan Mendelson, CEO of Avalere Health.\n\nThe bottom line: take the time to make the right decision. That's especially important for those who have never had insurance before.\n\n\"Don't wait until the last minute,\" said Bertram Scott, CEO of Affinity Health Plan, which is selling on the exchange.\n\n\"This is an important decision.\"\n\nJovishoff spent a month doing research and there were plenty of eye openers. Many plans she looked at did not include her doctors.\n\nMost, but not all, of the doctors she sees are part of North Shore-LIJ's network, but she will be restricted to using its hospitals. Even so, she is grateful.\n\n\"Obamacare is far, far from perfect,\" said Jovishoff's husband Michael, 67.\n\n\"But without it, health care would have been untenable, even for upper middle-class people like us.\"\n\npfurman@nydailynews.com\n\n--------\n\nCan't do this yourself?
