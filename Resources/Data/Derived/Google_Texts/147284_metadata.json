According to Fox 5 San Diego, the agency threatened to shutter the Oceanside, Calif., gun store if Karras refused to turn over the list of more than 5,000 customers who purchased the item.\n\n\u201cThey said either give us these 5,000 names or we are coming in and taking pretty much anything \u2014 which is a huge privacy concern and something we are not willing to do,\u201d Karras, a former United States Marine, told Fox 5.\n\nAccording to the ATF, the part, an 80 percent lower receiver, is illegal if not compliant with the agency\u2019s specifications.\n\nThe bases made by a manufacturer and sold by Ares Armor are made of plastic and come in different colors. The part shows customers where to drill to make building the rifles easier and cheaper.\n\nThe ATF says this specific make is illegal, and gun stores selling the part have been instructed to turn over lists of customers who possess them.\n\nKarras, however, argues the agency doesn\u2019t have an interest in investigating his business, but rather his customers.\n\n\u201cThey were going to search all of our facilities and confiscate our computers and pretty much shut down our business,\u201d the former Marine said. \u201cThe government invades our privacy on a daily basis, and everyone seems to thinks that it\u2019s ok. This is one of those situations where hopefully the judicial system will come in and say \u2018this is private information, this is protected, and no, you\u2019re not taking it from them.'\u201d\n\nTo prepare for a potential raid from the ATF, Karras filed for and was granted a temporary restraining order against the agency, which prevents them from taking their property.\n\nThe ATF now has the opportunity to respond.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "A former Marine and gun-store owner is pushing back against the federal government, refusing to turn over a list of customers who purchased an item needed to build firearms in the interest of protecting their privacy.", "title": "Gun store owner denies feds access to customer list - Red Alert...", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2013/03/AR-15-gun-600x381.jpg", "height": 381}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2014/03/15/gun-store-owner-denies-feds-access-to-customer-list/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "second-amendment-ar-15", "published_time": "2014-03-15T15:06:40+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-04-07T07:36:46+00:00", "author": "melissa.quinn.9461"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "According to Fox 5 San Diego, the agency threatened to shutter the Oceanside, Calif., gun store if Karras refused to turn over the list of more than 5,000 customers who purchased the item.\nThe Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives approached Dimitrios Karras, the owner of Ares Armor, and asked for a list of customers who purchased the base needed to build an AR-15.\n'\u201dTo prepare for a potential raid from the ATF, Karras filed for and was granted a temporary restraining order against the agency, which prevents them from taking their property.\nAccording to the ATF, the part, an 80 percent lower receiver, is illegal if not compliant with the agency\u2019s specifications.\nKarras, however, argues the agency doesn\u2019t have an interest in investigating his business, but rather his customers."}
