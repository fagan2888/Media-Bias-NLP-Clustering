People who are casually religious may walk away and not look back. But for others religion is at the very heart of their identity, worldview and community, and having a safe place to process doubts can be a metaphorical godsend.\n\n\u201cReclaimers,\u201d people who are actively working to rebuild their lives after a period of religious immersion, may struggle with harmful ideas and emotions from the beliefs they once held or the behavior of fellow believers. Alternately, they may find that leaving is lonely and disorienting. Marlene Winell, a human development consultant who assists people leaving their religion, coined the term Religious Trauma Syndrome to describe a pattern she saw in some clients, in particular those leaving closed, authoritarian, fear-based communities. But even doubters who don\u2019t experience this level of distress may find themselves feeling confused, afraid, self-doubting or overwhelmed.\n\nSince 2009, a small nonprofit called Recovering From Religion, has worked to serve this population by establishing peer support groups, organizing \u201cRecovering Your Sexuality\u201d classes, and providing a matchmaking service for clients seeking therapists who are committed to a secular approach. In March, Recovering From Religion launched a hotline, 1-84-I-DoubtIt, staffed by a cadre of volunteers trained in listening and crisis triage techniques. From years of daily emails and calls to their office, the staff knew there was an unmet need. Even so, they were caught off guard by the response\u2014over 1,000 calls in the first six weeks.\n\nIn this interview, Sarah Morehead, executive director of Recovering From Religion, talks about why her work is a personal passion and about the recovery hotline itself.\n\nValerie Tarico: Your commitment to supporting people in religious transitions comes from your own transition, which started with you as a life-long member of the Southern Baptist Convention and ended with you as an atheist.\n\nSarah Morehead: Yes. It was a long journey. Twelve years ago, I separated from my Promise Keeper husband. He had been violent toward me, but when he turned that on our kids, it was over for me. I found myself strapped financially, and in desperation I went to the benevolence committee at my church and asked for $600 to help pay the bills. This was a huge, successful mega-church, and the benevolence committee was their mechanism for helping members in need. The committee\u2014all men\u2014said they needed to pray about my request, and that regardless I needed to go to counseling about how to be a more godly wife so that I could lead my husband back to Christ through my submissiveness. They said this even though they knew he was physically abusive. Then, after praying, they let me know that Jesus wasn\u2019t keen on them giving me the money.\n\nAs I was leaving I pushed open the church door and bumped into someone etching decorations on the outside, and I had an odd thought. I had just heard that God didn\u2019t want me to have the $600 but this etching on the doors was totally cool with him. I couldn\u2019t put my finger on it at the time, but that was the point that it stopped adding up. You question one piece and then another and then another. Eventually my conscience outweighed my creedal viewpoint.\n\nVT: The heart of your Christianity was belief in God and his word and your relationship to Jesus. But this question of compassion and support is what rattled you and created that first crack.\n\nSM: It was a combination\u2014the disorienting lack of support on the inside and then equally disorienting support from an outsider. We had neighbors, two men who lived caddy-corner across the alley. We kept our children away from their children because they had a flag that I thought was satanic. Now I know it was just pagan. They would have bonfires in their back yard, and it was terrifying to me.\n\nAfter I got home from the church, there was a knock at the door and it was one of the guys from across the alley way. He said, \u201cWe don\u2019t talk much but I know there\u2019s a lot going on for you guys and here is a casserole.\u201d It was one of the more surreal moments in my life. I remember standing there and in my mind asking God what he was trying to tell me. Would Satan tempt me through the kindness of macaroni and cheese?\n\nOur homeschool support groups pulled away when they heard of the divorce, and then when they learned I wasn\u2019t going to that church anymore they stopped letting their kids hang out with my kids. It was very isolating and scary because I didn\u2019t know anyone, other than the neighbor I had met, who had really survived this idea of reconsidering religion.\n\nVT: You were really on your own.\n\nSM: The only people who had the courage to say that they didn\u2019t have all of the answers were this couple, who as it turned out were gay\u2014of course they were, but it took me a while to figure that out because they couldn\u2019t be gay because they were nice and gay people were pedophiles.\n\nVT: So there you were, trying to juggle the loss of your faith and your entire community, while taking care of your children, who were also dealing with abandonment.\n\nSM: The loss of my faith wasn\u2019t all at once, as it isn\u2019t for many people. At first the changes were tiny. I remember the moment when I had the epiphany that American Baptists might not burn in hell. Later, Bible-believing Christianity stopped working for me, but for a long time I thought that was a problem with me, not with the religion. I was probably destined for hell, but I just couldn\u2019t figure it out. Eventually I tried out more liberal religious viewpoints, like the Unitarian Church. When I finally realized I don\u2019t believe this anymore, I didn\u2019t know where I fit.\n\nI had come on this huge, huge journey with no map, and I didn\u2019t know where I was. But you go on the internet and connect with people who are struggling, people who are going through the same things. So, that\u2019s my motivation. There are people who are scared and lonely and afraid and who think they are the only person on the planet who can\u2019t figure it out. The relief some of these people experience when I talk to them\u2014being able to offer them that bridge when there\u2019s nowhere else to go\u2014that is one of the most rewarding things imaginable.\n\nVT: So tell me about Recovering From Religion\u2014the organization.\n\nSM: It was founded by Psychologist Darrel Ray in 2009, after he wrote The God Virus.The book kicked off conversations that made the need apparent, so he started the network of peer support groups. But his time was limited. I came on board in 2011 and started developing it into a cohesive program.\n\nThe hotline project came about because of the emails that we get daily. People need someone to talk to, and the groups themselves\u2014we will never have enough locations that everyone has somewhere to go. So we thought, what if everyone could call and talk with one person, just someone respectful? There\u2019s a lot out there that mocks religion and hates on religion. There\u2019s a place for that, but for people who are gently feeling out where they are, they need a place that lets them have one foot in and out.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sarah Morehead of the nonprofit group Recovering From Religion reflects on her tortuous path to godlessness", "title": "\u201cI just don\u2019t believe this anymore\u201d: Why I abandoned my faith", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Sarah Morehead of the nonprofit group Recovering From Religion reflects on her tortuous path to godlessness", "title": "\u201cI just don\u2019t believe this anymore\u201d: Why I abandoned my faith", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/02/i_just_dont_believe_this_anymore_why_i_abandoned_my_faith_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/god_jesus.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Sarah Morehead of the nonprofit group Recovering From Religion reflects on her tortuous path to godlessness", "title": "\u201cI just don\u2019t believe this anymore\u201d: Why I abandoned my faith", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/god_jesus.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Valerie Tarico", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, AlterNet, Religion, Religious Right", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "When I finally realized I don\u2019t believe this anymore, I didn\u2019t know where I fit.\nI had come on this huge, huge journey with no map, and I didn\u2019t know where I was.\nBut even doubters who don\u2019t experience this level of distress may find themselves feeling confused, afraid, self-doubting or overwhelmed.\nIn March, Recovering From Religion launched a hotline, 1-84-I-DoubtIt, staffed by a cadre of volunteers trained in listening and crisis triage techniques.\nIt was very isolating and scary because I didn\u2019t know anyone, other than the neighbor I had met, who had really survived this idea of reconsidering religion."}
