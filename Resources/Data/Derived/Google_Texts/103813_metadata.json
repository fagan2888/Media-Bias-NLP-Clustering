Federal law prohibits felons from owning firearms.\n\nHenderson voluntarily surrendered his guns as a condition of his bail. But when he wanted to sell his guns to a friend for $3,500 or transfer them to his wife, the court stepped in and said no.\n\nHenderson challenged and for years fought in court until finally gaining victory. The Supreme Court ruled Monday that felons are allowed to keep the proceeds from their sold firearms. They can also choose who receives their guns as long as they aren\u2019t given to anyone who would allow the felon to exert control over them.\n\nProsecutors argued that selling the guns would mean he technically possessed them while selling, and they also expressed concern that he would be the de facto owner by selling them to someone close to him.\n\nThis outraged gun rights groups like the National Rifle Association, which filed an Amicus Brief in the case.\n\n\u201cThe result is that the Second Amendment rights of certain law-abiding, responsible citizens \u2013 such as family members or friends of individuals who have been convicted of a felony \u2013 are accorded less weight than the Second Amendment rights of other law-abiding citizens, including those who do not propose to use the firearms in question for the purpose of self-defense in the home,\u201d the brief reads.\n\nSCOTUS ruled that felons may transfer their guns for sale to a third party vendor, such as a gun vendor and in some cases a particular person as long as they can\u2019t continue to exert influence over the weapons.\n\n\u201cA felon cannot evade the strictures of (the law) by arranging a sham transfer that leaves him in effective control of his guns,\u201d Kagan wrote in the court\u2019s opinion.\n\nFollow Casey on Twitter and like him on Facebook", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Supreme Court expanded gun rights for felons Friday by allowing them to keep the proceeds from their sold firearms after they are seized by the government.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Libertarian Republic", "description": "The Supreme Court expanded gun rights for felons Friday by allowing them to keep the proceeds from their sold firearms after they are seized by the government.", "title": "Supreme Court Expands Gun Rights For Felons", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://thelibertarianrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/gunsummit_hd.jpg", "url": "http://thelibertarianrepublic.com/supreme-court-expands-gun-rights-for-felons/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@thelibrepublic", "image": "http://thelibertarianrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/gunsummit_hd.jpg", "description": "The Supreme Court expanded gun rights for felons Friday by allowing them to keep the proceeds from their sold firearms after they are seized by the government.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Supreme Court Expands Gun Rights For Felons"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 501616773}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/libertarianrepublic", "section": "Right to Bear Arms", "published_time": "2015-05-19T15:31:38+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/ProducerPetersen"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe071e\"", "article_summary": "The Supreme Court expanded gun rights for felons Friday by allowing them to keep the proceeds from their sold firearms after they are seized by the government.\nThis outraged gun rights groups like the National Rifle Association, which filed an Amicus Brief in the case.\nThe Supreme Court ruled Monday that felons are allowed to keep the proceeds from their sold firearms.\nWhen former Border Patrol Agent Tony Henderson was convicted of distributing marijuana, he knew he couldn\u2019t keep his collection of 19 guns.\nBut when he wanted to sell his guns to a friend for $3,500 or transfer them to his wife, the court stepped in and said no."}
