The store\u2019s 400 employees will stay on moving inventory through mid-February, reported the San Francisco Chronicle.\n\nWal-Mart Stores Inc. \u201ctook into account a number of factors, including financial performance as well as strategic alignment with long-term plans.\u201d The company said in a press release that it has plans to open 200 to 240 stores in the coming year internationally.\n\n\u201cActively managing our portfolio of assets is essential to maintaining a healthy business,\u201d Doug McMillon, president and chief executive of Wal-Mart, said in a statement. \u201cClosing stores is never an easy decision, but it is necessary to keep the company strong and positioned for the future.\u201d\n\nHundreds of Wal-Mart employees fasted this past November in protest for a $15 minimum wage, arguing that Wal-Mart employees do not make enough money to put food on the table.\n\nOakland Mayor Libby Schaaf, a Democrat, has been leading statewide efforts to raise the minimum wage to $15.\n\n\u201cThis higher city minimum wage eliminated the jobs of the very workers advocates wanted to help,\u201d said James Sherk, a research fellow in labor economics at The Heritage Foundation.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s minimum wage rose to $10 an hour on Jan. 1. Oakland\u2019s minimum wage was bumped from $9 to $12.25 in March 2015 and was raised to $12.55 at the start of this year.\n\n\u201cThe true minimum wage is $0.00 an hour,\u201d Sherk said. \u201cCompanies do not have to hire workers, and they will not pay them more than the value they create.\u201d\n\nIf the Oakland Wal-Mart workers don\u2019t find employment by Feb. 10, they will get 60 days of additional pay and a severance package with a week of pay for every year employed by Wal-Mart, reports the San Francisco Chronicle.\n\nOther Wal-Mart locations may hire some of the Oakland workers, ABC 7 News reports. More than 95 percent of the stores closing are within an average of 10 miles of another Wal-Mart in the United States.\n\nThe San Francisco Chronicle says two Wal-Mart locations in Oakland\u2019s neighboring city of San Leandro, where minimum wage is $10, will remain open.\n\nThe difference between these three locations is the Oakland Wal-Mart has over a 25 percent difference in labor costs for entry-level employees than the San Leandro locations, says Mark Perry, an American Enterprise Institute scholar and professor of economics and finance at the University of Michigan\u2019s Flint campus.\n\n\u201cGiven the reality that Wal-Mart operates on razor-thin profit margins (only 2.8 percent last quarter), a 25 percent difference in labor costs for entry-level workers can be the difference between a store that turns a profit and a store that barely breaks even, or loses money,\u201d Perry wrote.\n\nOf the U.S. stores closing, 102 are Wal-Mart Express locations, smaller convenience stores that have been piloted since 2011.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday that most Wal-Mart hourly store employees in the U.S. will see a pay increase in February.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Wal-Mart announced it will close 269 stores globally\u2014including 154 locations in the United States\u2014impacting about 10,000 associates in the U.S.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Wal-Mart announced it will close 269 stores globally\u2014including 154 locations in the United States\u2014impacting about 10,000 associates in the U.S.", "title": "Oakland\u2019s Minimum Wage Is Up, Wal-Mart Is Out", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150121_WalmartMinWage_Jessen.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-01-26T11:03:09+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1QpObOY"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Wal-Mart announced it will close 269 stores globally\u2014including 154 locations in the United States\u2014impacting about 10,000 associates in the U.S.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150121_WalmartMinWage_Jessen.jpg"}, "title": "Oakland\u2019s Minimum Wage Is Up, Wal-Mart Is Out", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "minimum wage", "published_time": "2016-01-22T16:12:35+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-26T11:03:09+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Oakland, California, minimum wage, Walmart, closure, jobs, employment, economy"}, "article_summary": "The San Francisco Chronicle says two Wal-Mart locations in Oakland\u2019s neighboring city of San Leandro, where minimum wage is $10, will remain open.\nA minimum wage of $12.55 an hour in Oakland, Calif., may be the culprit for a Wal-Mart store\u2019s closure.\nOakland\u2019s minimum wage was bumped from $9 to $12.25 in March 2015 and was raised to $12.55 at the start of this year.\nCalifornia\u2019s minimum wage rose to $10 an hour on Jan. 1.\nOakland Mayor Libby Schaaf, a Democrat, has been leading statewide efforts to raise the minimum wage to $15."}
