Chazan\u2019s case illustrates Poland\u2019s version of the battle between pro-life conscience rights and liberal values\u2014a battle pro-life Americans are enduring in legal confrontations over Obamacare\u2019s contraceptive mandate.\n\nThe Polish doctor\u2019s troubles began in April, when a pregnant woman wrote to his maternity hospital in Warsaw, the Holy Family Hospital, asking for an abortion. She said her personal physician had detected severe developmental defects in the unborn baby. Chazan, a Roman Catholic who has served as director of the hospital for the past 10 years, wrote back, saying he could not provide an abortion due to a \u201cconflict of conscience.\u201d He provided an address to a hospice that could care for the baby after it was born.\n\nFor that exercise of conscience, Warsaw Mayor Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz announced in July she was dismissing Chazan from his position at the government-run hospital. She said Chazan did not have the right to refuse the abortion, and said Polish law obliged him to offer the woman an abortion referral. An investigation by the mayor\u2019s office accused Chazan of ordering unnecessary tests that delayed the woman\u2019s abortion request, prolonging her pregnancy beyond 24 weeks of gestation, the time when doctors generally consider an unborn baby \u201cviable.\u201d After viability, abortion of a handicapped baby in Poland is illegal. The hospital was also fined $23,000, and Chazan was given a three-month job termination notice and placed on leave.\n\nWe see you\u2019ve been enjoying the content on our exclusive member website.

Could they be dismissed next?\n\nThe woman ultimately gave birth to a baby boy at another Warsaw facility, the Bielanski hospital. A doctor there, Romuald Debski, tried to paint abortion as compassionate by describing the baby\u2019s deformities in uncompassionate detail. \u201cThis child does not have half of its head, has a hanging eyeball, its face is split, it has no brain inside,\u201d said Debski, according to Reuters. \u201cIf Professor Chazan saw the life that he saved, he would have a different attitude.\u201d The baby died a few days after birth.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Chazan has made a costly stand on principle: Twelve years ago, he was dismissed as head of the obstetrics and gynecology clinic of another Warsaw hospital, the National Research Institute of Mother and Child, following a similar situation. \u201cLo and behold, lighting does strike twice!\u201d said Robert Walley, the executive director of the Newfoundland-based MaterCare International, a Catholic ob-gyn charity where Chazan serves as a council member. \u201cHe has shown great courage.\u201d\n\nI reached 69-year-old Chazan\u2014amid his bustle to clean out his hospital office\u2014and asked about the recent controversy and his current situation.\n\nYour dismissal from Holy Family Hospital came after you refused to provide an abortion. But did your hospital ever provide abortions? Before I become the director, abortions were carried out at the hospital\u2014a dozen or more a year, mainly due to diagnosed diseases or developmental disorders in the fetus. During my term [as director], abortion was carried out once, in 2006, due to anencephaly in the fetus. I found out about that recently, and it probably took place while I was on vacation. We rarely had patients turn to our hospital with the intention of carrying out an abortion. I usually managed to make them change their intentions. Besides, patients knew that we did not perform abortions at this hospital, and I believe it was accepted. There were no complaints to the authorities, as in the present case.\n\nI would like to add that the next day after I was dismissed and sent on a \u201ccompulsory\u201d vacation, another abortion was performed in the hospital.\n\nSome liberals complain about losing abortion access. There is no need for all hospitals in Poland to be forced to perform abortions. We have about 800 legal abortions a year, and about 400 ob-gyn wards: There are two abortions a year per hospital.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "WORLD", "description": "Q&A | Bogdan Chazan lost his post heading a Polish government\u2013run maternity hospital after he said his conscience prevented him from killing an unborn child", "title": "WORLD | The doctor who refused to abort | Daniel James Devine | Aug. 9, 2014", "url": "http://www.worldmag.com/2014/08/the_doctor_who_refused_to_abort", "image": "http://www.worldmag.com/media/images/content/bogdan_chazan.jpg", "type": "article"}, "keywords": "world magazine, christian world news magazine, christian views, christian perspectives, god's world magazine", "description": "Q&A | Bogdan Chazan lost his post heading a Polish government\u2013run maternity hospital after he said his conscience prevented him from killing an unborn child"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1359\"", "article_summary": "Polish media outlets have been abuzz this summer with the story of Bogdan Chazan, a prominent Warsaw doctor who refused to provide a woman with an abortion and was subsequently sacked.\nFor that exercise of conscience, Warsaw Mayor Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz announced in July she was dismissing Chazan from his position at the government-run hospital.\nYour dismissal from Holy Family Hospital came after you refused to provide an abortion.\nA doctor there, Romuald Debski, tried to paint abortion as compassionate by describing the baby\u2019s deformities in uncompassionate detail.\nBut did your hospital ever provide abortions?"}
