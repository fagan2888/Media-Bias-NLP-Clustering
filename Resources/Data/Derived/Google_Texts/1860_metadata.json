( Johnnie St. Vrain / Longmont Times-Call )\n\nHi Johnnie: With the increasing need for lower income housing, how does a landlady apply to be able to accept Section 8 housing funds to offset all or part of rental fee? Thank you for the tip. \u2014 Landlady in Waiting\n\nHi Landlady: I turned to Krystal Winship Erazo, director of operations for the Longmont Housing Authority.\n\nGiven the low vacancy rates and high demand in the market right now, Winship Erazo was excited to hear about your interest in the Housing Choice Voucher (Section 8) Program.\n\nIn an email, Winship Erazo said that the LHA partners with 190 property owners to administer the 434 vouchers currently in the program.\n\nThe Section 8 program, according to the LHA's website, is a three-way contract among the renter, the landlord and authority, in which each agrees to meet certain requirements. For you, Landlady, that means meeting certain housing quality standards and charging a reasonable rent.\n\n\"Any interested landladies, landlords and property owners are welcome to contact our office (303-651-8581) to provide information on available units to our participants that are currently out looking,\" Erazo wrote, \"Once a Section 8 participant is approved by the landlord, the Housing Authority will approve the unit with a Housing Quality Standards inspection, process direct deposit information and approve an annual lease to be executed.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHey Johnnie: While visiting the new Regal theater on Monday I noticed a gentleman trying to enter with a woman in a wheelchair. I write \"trying\" because there are only two doors to enter and neither have any mechanical assist for patrons with disabilities. How is this possible?\n\nI would think this would be a code requirement. I helped hold a door but there may not always be someone as heroic as I there to assist people who could use a little extra help. \u2014 Zero to Hero\n\nHey Hero: It seemed unlikely to me that there was no wheelchair-accessible entrance, so I took a look for myself.\n\nI found the door, and I think I know why the people you saw might have overlooked it. This single door is directly to the right of the box office, so someone who just purchased tickets might walk right past the door without noticing.\n\nWhen I went the theater last Monday night, the area around the box office was crowded, so to get to the entrances, I had to walk around others who were in line to purchase tickets. Even if I had been looking for that door, I likely would not have spotted it.\n\nSpeaking of heroes, thanks to the theater and to the more than 8,000 people who came out for the first three, $3 movie nights. Regal raised $20,000 for the OUR Center, $13,000 for Adoption Exchange, and $15,000 for the I Have A Dream Foundation of Boulder County.\n\nSend questions to johnnie@times-call.com", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.timescall.com/columnists/johnnie-st-vrain/ci_29118431/johnnie-st-vrain-landlady-wants-help-affordable-housing", "modificationDate": "2015-11-16T12:28:12-0700", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/1114/20151114__16TCAJSVw~1_300.jpg", "endDate": "2025-11-14T18:12:35-0700", "description": "Hi Johnnie: With the increasing need for lower income housing, how does a landlady apply to be able to accept Section 8 housing funds to offset all or part of rental fee?", "ag": {"canon": "LongmontTimes-Call:article:29118431:view"}, "startDate": "2015-11-15T08:00:00-0700", "og": {"url": "http://www.timescall.com/columnists/johnnie-st-vrain/ci_29118431/johnnie-st-vrain-landlady-wants-help-affordable-housing", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/1114/20151114__16TCAJSVw~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Hi Johnnie: With the increasing need for lower income housing, how does a landlady apply to be able to accept Section 8 housing funds to offset all or part of rental fee?", "title": "Johnnie St. Vrain: Landlady wants to help with affordable housing"}, "twitter": {"domain": "timescall.com", "description": "Hi Johnnie: With the increasing need for lower income housing, how does a landlady apply to be able to accept Section 8 housing funds to offset all or part of rental fee?", "title": "Johnnie St. Vrain: Landlady wants to help with affordable housing", "url": "http://www.timescall.com/columnists/johnnie-st-vrain/ci_29118431/johnnie-st-vrain-landlady-wants-help-affordable-housing", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/1114/20151114__16TCAJSVw~1.jpg", "site": "@TimesCall", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-11-15T08:00:00-0700", "sailthru.site": "timescall.com", "sailthru.title": "Johnnie St. Vrain: Landlady wants to help with affordable housing", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Johnnie St. Vrain", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "lLtD9ZooxmJUEEdRSCVzkO06t_hYKtyDqZF7EA3N2U0", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/1114/20151114__16TCAJSVw~1.jpg", "pubDate": "2015-11-14T18:18:32-0700"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1068\"", "article_summary": "\u2014 Landlady in WaitingHi Landlady: I turned to Krystal Winship Erazo, director of operations for the Longmont Housing Authority.\nIn an email, Winship Erazo said that the LHA partners with 190 property owners to administer the 434 vouchers currently in the program.\n( Johnnie St. Vrain / Longmont Times-Call )Hi Johnnie: With the increasing need for lower income housing, how does a landlady apply to be able to accept Section 8 housing funds to offset all or part of rental fee?\nAdvertisementHey Johnnie: While visiting the new Regal theater on Monday I noticed a gentleman trying to enter with a woman in a wheelchair.\nThe wheelchair-accessible door at Regal Cinemas at Village at the Peaks was kept open on and hard to miss Saturday afternoon."}
