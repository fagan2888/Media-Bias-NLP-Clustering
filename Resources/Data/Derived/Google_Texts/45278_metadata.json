(Photo: Charlie Litchfield/The Register )Buy Photo\n\nThe picture on the front of of April 13 business section shows a farmer applying anhydrous ammonia. I hope it\u2019s just the camera angle, but it looks as though the farmer is used to placing crop rows up and down the hill instead of on the contour. It also appears that there are a couple places where grassed waterways could be used to slow erosion. Terracing is another conservation method that could be used on this sort of topography.\n\nI wonder how much precious Iowa topsoil will be lost, and how much nitrogen will wind up in someone\u2019s drinking water, because of farming practices shown in this photo.\n\nIn 150 years, topsoil in Iowa has gone from an average of 16 inches to just six to eight inches. It looks like we are rapidly on our way to zero.\n\n\u2014 Mark R.
