To do this, hospitals must delivery compassionate, coordinated care to patients every day.\n\nShe offers six strategies:\n\nAcknowledge patient suffering. Recognize patients are in pain and show them you understand. Be aware of body language. Use non-verbal communication skills, keeping in mind they are equally as important as words. Treat anxiety as suffering. Anxiety and uncertainly are negative outcomes, so address them as part of the patient experience. Coordinate care. Show patients their care is coordinated, continuous and that the healthcare team will always be there for them. Transcend diagnosis through care. Embrace the reality that care goes beyond delivering medical interventions to the patient. Reduce suffering through autonomy. Ensure patient dignity by allowing patients to make informed healthcare decisions.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n3 ways hospitals can reduce patient suffering\n\n3 pathways to patient-centered care\n\nStudy: Nurses that show more compassion suffer fatigue, stress\n\nFront-line hospitals staff as daily problem solvers", "article_metadata": {"description": "In order to boost\u00a0patient satisfaction\u00a0and reduce\u00a0suffering\u00a0throughout the healthcare continuum,\u00a0nurses\u00a0must improve the perception of patient care that they provide every day,\u00a0according to\u00a0Advance Healthcare Network for Nurses.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "In order to boost\u00a0patient satisfaction\u00a0and reduce\u00a0suffering\u00a0throughout the healthcare continuum,\u00a0nurses\u00a0must improve the perception of patient care that they provide every day,\u00a0according to\u00a0Advance Healthcare Network for Nurses.", "title": "6 ways nurses can reduce patient suffering", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/6-ways-nurses-can-reduce-patient-suffering/2014-08-21", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Care Delivery,front-line workers,HR & Workforce Management,Nurses,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes,patient satisfaction,patient suffering", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,HR & Workforce Management,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes,Patient Satisfaction"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcd3b\"", "article_summary": "In order to boost patient satisfaction and reduce suffering throughout the healthcare continuum, nurses must improve the perception of patient care that they provide every day, according to Advance Healthcare Network for Nurses.\nTo learn more:- here's the articleRelated Articles:3 ways hospitals can reduce patient suffering3 pathways to patient-centered careStudy: Nurses that show more compassion suffer fatigue, stressFront-line hospitals staff as daily problem solvers\nShe offers six strategies:Acknowledge patient suffering.\nReduce suffering through autonomy.\n\"It is incumbent upon us as nurses to mitigate the inherent suffering and eliminate avoidable suffering in order to provide patients with optimal care in every setting,\" Dempsey writes."}
