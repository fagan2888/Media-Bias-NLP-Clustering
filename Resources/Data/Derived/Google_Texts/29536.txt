An air ambulance carrying a patient with a gunshot wound to a hospital crashed near downtown Wichita Falls early Saturday, killing the patient and injuring three crew members on board.

The Air Evac Lifeteam chopper picked up a patient in Waurika, Oklahoma and was descending toward United Regional Hospital when it crashed just before 2 a.m., Wichita Falls officials said in a Facebook post.

A pilot, nurse and paramedic were on board with the patient, who died at the scene. First responders were able to pull the crew members from the wreckage and transport them to hospitals for treatment, city officials said.

As of 6:20 a.m., the pilot was listed in serious but stable condition at United Regional Hospital.

The flight nurse and paramedic were transported to Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas. Information about their injuries was not available.

Lynn Lunsford, a Federal Aviation Authority spokesman, said the National Transportation Safety Board and FAA’s investigation of the crash may take several months to a year.

On preliminary investigation though, he said the copter appears to have hit a power line before the fiery crash.

“But I don’t know what the scenario is at this point,” he said.

Wichita Falls police could not immediately be reached.
