Much of that income came from consulting contracts with unspecified clients, as well as a relationship with the investment bank Lehman Brothers, which hired Bush not long after he left the governor\u2019s mansion.\n\nRelated: Trump Bump Continues, but Support May Be Limited\n\nBush voluntarily released tax data for the 33 years between 1981 and 2013 as a demonstration of transparency and, presumably, to nip in the bud the sort of challenge that faced 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney after he refused to release much tax information at all.\n\nRomney was also hammered for paying an average tax rate of below 15 percent on his considerable income, mainly because it was all taxed as capital gains rather than as wage or salary. Bush, in his release, was eager to point out that his average federal tax rate during those 33 years was 36 percent.\n\nThe number is a little puzzling, because during the bulk of Bush\u2019s biggest earning years, even the top marginal tax rate was only 35 percent. Hopefully in a Bush White House, whoever did his taxes will be kept far away from the Office of Management & Budget.\n\n(Financial planner Michael Kitces digs into the details of Bush\u2019s alleged 36 percent effective tax rate here. Verdict: He\u2019s stretching the truth. Quite a bit.)\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "If the 2016 presidential race eventually boils down to another Bush versus another Clinton, the two top contenders will have more in common than a famous last name and close relatives who have also sat in the Oval Office.
