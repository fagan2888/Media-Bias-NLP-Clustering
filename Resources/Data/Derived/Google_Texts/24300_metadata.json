We understand this road trip is a big road trip for us.\u201d\n\nDougie Hamilton scored his career-high 11th goal for Calgary. Back home after three games on the road, the Flames head back out for a four-game trip beginning Monday in Arizona.\n\nChicago led 2-1 on Shaw\u2019s 14th goal with 49 seconds remaining in the second period.\n\nMichael Rozsival spotted Shaw open at the side of the net and directed a hard slap-pass from the point diagonally through the slot that Shaw deflected behind Joni Ortio.\n\nDarling improved to 8-7-3. He was perfect after Hamilton\u2019s goal in his fifth start in a row with Corey Crawford (upper body) sidelined and not on the road trip.\n\n\u201cDarling was huge. He made some big-time saves. He fought through traffic to find pucks. He was lights out tonight,\u201d Shaw said.\n\nDarling was especially sharp in the second period when his 11 saves included several key stops to keep the game 1-1.\n\nIt was a stellar bounce-back outing after being pulled after the first period last game against Dallas, when he allowed four goals on 15 shots.\n\n\u201cWe had unbelievable chances in the second period on our power play. I thought that our power play deserved to score a goal. We had great chances but we just couldn\u2019t get the red light on,\u201d Flames coach Bob Hartley said.\n\nStory Continues \u2192", "article_metadata": {"description": "Clutch performances from Andrew Ladd and Scott Darling led the slumping Chicago Blackhawks to an important victory on Saturday night.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Clutch performances from Andrew Ladd and Scott Darling led the slumping Chicago Blackhawks to an important victory on Saturday night.", "title": "Ladd has 2 goals, assist and Blackhawks beat Flames 4-1", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/27/ladd-has-2-goals-assist-and-blackhawks-beat-flames/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/03/27/blackhawks_flames_hockey.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/03/27/blackhawks_flames_hockey.jpeg", "description": "Clutch performances from Andrew Ladd and Scott Darling led the slumping Chicago Blackhawks to an important victory on Saturday night.", "card": "summary", "title": "Ladd has 2 goals, assist and Blackhawks beat Flames 4-1"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "We understand this road trip is a big road trip for us.\u201dDougie Hamilton scored his career-high 11th goal for Calgary.\nCALGARY, Alberta (AP) - Clutch performances from Andrew Ladd and Scott Darling led the slumping Chicago Blackhawks to an important victory on Saturday night.\nLadd had two goals and an assist and Scott Darling made 31 saves to lead Chicago to a 4-1 victory over the Calgary Flames.\n\u201cWe had unbelievable chances in the second period on our power play.\nDarling was especially sharp in the second period when his 11 saves included several key stops to keep the game 1-1."}
