Until Putin formalized the end of the ban Monday, such a sale was still technically illegal.\n\nRelated: Putin\u2019s Mac Attack Would Take a Bite Out of McDonald\u2019s\n\nThe move clears the way for a long-delayed transfer of Russian-made S-300 air defense missiles to Iran. The missiles, while not the most advanced air defense weapon made in Russia, are nonetheless considered highly effective.\n\nIran has been in years-long talks with the U.S., Russia, China, France, Germany and England over scaling back its nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions that have squeezed the Iranian economy. Citing progress in the ongoing \u201cP5+1\u201d negotiations, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said the ban on weapons sales is no longer necessary.\n\n\u201cWe are convinced that at this stage, there\u2019s no more need of such an embargo \u2014 Russia\u2019s separate voluntary embargo,\u201d Lavrov told the government-owned TASS news service. \u201c[The] S-300 is an air defense missile system, which is of a purely defensive nature. It is not designed for attacks and will not put at risk the security of any regional state, including Israel.\u201d\n\nRelated: Who Hacked the White House? Putin Says, \u2018Not Us\u2019\n\nThe decision to lift the ban will no doubt raise serious concerns in Israel, where leaders are already extremely dubious about Iran\u2019s claims that its nuclear program is meant for purely peaceful purposes. The Israelis have, in the past, taken unilateral action to destroy what they saw as a threatening nuclear facility, bombing the Osirak nuclear reactor outside Baghdad, Iraq in 1981.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has made it clear that his government views unilateral action against Iran\u2019s nuclear program as one of Israel\u2019s options, and the Russian decision to offer Tehran advanced air defense capabilities will surely rankle both Israel and its primary supporter and ally, the United States.\n\nThe original sale of the missile systems to Iran was supposed to have taken place in 2010, but Russia backed out of the deal, imposing its ban after the U.N. imposed sanctions on Iran, though the sanctions regime did not actually bar the transaction. Iran sued Russia in the International Court of Justice for breach of contract.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "With talks between Iran and major world powers at a critical phase, Russian President", "title": "Putin Looking to Sell Anti-Aircraft Missiles to Iran", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/13/Putin-Looking-Sell-Anti-Aircraft-Missiles-Iran", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/slideshows/04272012_Putin_19_slideshow.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/13/Putin-Looking-Sell-Anti-Aircraft-Missiles-Iran", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/slideshows/04272012_Putin_19_slideshow.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "With talks between Iran and major world powers at a critical phase, Russian President", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8b24\"", "article_summary": "Related: Putin\u2019s Mac Attack Would Take a Bite Out of McDonald\u2019sThe move clears the way for a long-delayed transfer of Russian-made S-300 air defense missiles to Iran.\nThe missiles, while not the most advanced air defense weapon made in Russia, are nonetheless considered highly effective.\n\u201c[The] S-300 is an air defense missile system, which is of a purely defensive nature.\nUntil Putin formalized the end of the ban Monday, such a sale was still technically illegal.\nIran sued Russia in the International Court of Justice for breach of contract."}
