He likened those supporting Trump to teenagers throwing a temper tantrum and speculated that would \u201cgrow out of it\u201d and turn their support else where.\n\nPartial transcript as follows:\n\nBARNICLE: Charlie, let me ask you this. I do not disagree with your theory here. But do you think as I think when I sigh the Trump crowds, he has a definite floor that he\u2019s not going to go below. I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s 20 percent, 18, 22 \u2013 I don\u2019t know. But the people who show up to see him, hear him and laugh with him. They\u2019re not leaving. They\u2019re not going to leave this guy.\n\nCOOK: Mike, when you were in junior high school and there was a fight out behind the school building, did a big crowd gather? \u2026 Or a magician performing at a square in a town. I mean, just drawing a crowd doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re going to get elected president of the United States. There\u2019s just sort of this a curiosity of what the hell is he going to say next. That\u2019s fine but it doesn\u2019t get you elected president of the United States.\n\nBARNICLE: I agree.\n\nGEIST: So Charlie, at what point does it turn then if you believe it started now? Those people who have come out so strongly for Donald Trump, is it no until the voting begins in Iowa or New Hampshire?\n\nCOOK: If we\u2019re looking at numbers in, OK, the Iowa Caucus is February 1. New Hampshire Primary is eight days later. If we\u2019re look at numbers in February like the numbers we\u2019ve seen the last month, two months, three months then this theory goes out the window.\n\nBut, I think we\u2019re seeing this thing sort of run the course. People are going to sober up. You got half the Republican Party are engaged in a temper tantrum and we\u2019ve all had teenagers and we\u2019ve all seen how they, and then they eventually kind of grow out of it, settle out of it and I think you\u2019re going to see a more exotic wing of the Republican Party \u2014 I think you\u2019re going to start seeing them settle down over the next couple of months.\n\nSCARBOROUGH: Alright, Charlie Cook. I\u2019m going to call you a Donald Trump denier in the primary. You bring up great points about the general election.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Charlie Cook: Trump Supporters 'Engaged in a Temper Tantrum,' Will Eventually 'Grow Out of It'", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Charlie Cook: Trump Supporters 'Engaged in a Temper Tantrum,' Will Eventually 'Grow Out of It'", "title": "Charlie Cook: Trump Supporters 'Engaged in a Temper Tantrum,' Will Eventually 'Grow Out of It' - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 932, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/10/Cook1012.jpg", "height": 699}, "updated_time": "2015-10-12T08:47:40-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2015/10/12/charlie-cook-trump-supporters-engaged-in-a-temper-tantrum-will-eventually-grow-out-of-it/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Charlie Cook: Trump Supporters 'Engaged in a Temper Tantrum,' Will Eventually 'Grow Out of It'", "creator": "@jeff_poor", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/10/Cook1012.jpg", "title": "Charlie Cook: Trump Supporters 'Engaged in a Temper Tantrum,' Will Eventually 'Grow Out of It' - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Charlie Cook, Donald Trump, Joe Scarborough, Morning Joe,2016 Presidential Race, Breitbart TV,Charlie Cook", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-10-12T08:40:25-07:00", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "modified_time": "2015-10-12T08:47:40-07:00", "tag": "Morning Joe", "categories": "Breitbart TV,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "Monday on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe,\u201d Charlie Cook, editor and publisher of the Cook Political Report, expressed his skepticism about the longevity of GOP presidential front-runner Donald Trump and his campaign.\nSCARBOROUGH: Alright, Charlie Cook.\nThose people who have come out so strongly for Donald Trump, is it no until the voting begins in Iowa or New Hampshire?\nI mean, just drawing a crowd doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re going to get elected president of the United States.\nIf we\u2019re look at numbers in February like the numbers we\u2019ve seen the last month, two months, three months then this theory goes out the window."}
