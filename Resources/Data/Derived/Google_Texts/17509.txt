The numbers will only get higher. With the Washington echo chamber in full swing, it would be easy to forget the enrollment numbers just released this week. Even though it’s clearly understood that the Affordable Care Act’s website (healthcare.gov) has been dysfunctional, there were over 100,000 people who enrolled for health care in 33 days. With Medicaid and private plans combined, the number of enrollees is over 502,000.

As Republicans push the idea that the Affordable Care Act will fail, the number of Americans enrolling is certain to increase as healthcare.gov is fixed. Americans in need of health insurance are not likely to be focused on Washington’s echo chamber. With over 45 million people in America walking around with no health insurance at all, the enrollment numbers for the Affordable Care Act will certainly increase as time moves forward.
