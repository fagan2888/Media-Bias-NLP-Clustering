(Nasdaq: NNBR).\n\nAutocam is also expected to continue its employee training programs, which aim to develop a skilled workforce for the company, he said. Through Autocam\u2019s Advanced Manufacturing Partnership program with Grand Rapids Community College, the company pays for employees\u2019 education while they continue to work for the manufacturer. Kennedy said he believes those programs will continue under the new ownership, since many of NN\u2019s talent development needs are similar to Autocam\u2019s.\n\n\u201c(NN) was very intrigued by what we were doing, and I wouldn\u2019t see any reason why they would curtail any of that,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cIf anything, they would look at what they can do to bring that to their own businesses. \u2026 The same type of talent development that we do are all best practices they can use. I think that was one of the attractions to them of the Autocam business.\u201d\n\nA supplier of components for fuel systems, engines, transmissions, power steering and electric motors, Autocam said it expected to generate $250 million in sales this year and employs more than 2,100 people at 15 plants in the U.S., Europe, South America and Asia. The company also hoped to realize $42 million in revenue via a Chinese joint venture.\n\nNN Inc. is a manufacturer of high precision metal bearing components, industrial plastic and rubber products and precision metal components for a variety global industries. The company has 14 plants in the U.S., Europe and China and has sales of $373 million last year.\n\n\u201cThis acquisition is the next step in our ongoing strategy to aggressively grow our business through strategic, profitable acquisitions that provide complementary resources and lines of business,\u201d President and CEO Richard Holder said of the \u201ctransformative\u201d deal for NN Inc.\n\nThe Autocam brand will continue on after the transaction.\n\nAutocam founder and CEO Kennedy will become a \u201csignificant shareholder\u201d of NN Inc. and will be considered for a seat on the company\u2019s board of directors, according to a statement.\n\nKennedy said in an interview with MiBiz that there should be no significant changes for Autocam\u2019s West Michigan operations in the foreseeable future. The company has continued to invest in the region. Last month, it opened a new $10 million, 50,000-square-foot facility in Marshall that\u2019s expected to employ 85 people by 2018. The facility could employ as many as 170 people once fully utilized.\n\nAutocam was also in the news of late for the company\u2019s challenge to the Affordable Care Act. Kennedy has an ongoing lawsuit before the Supreme Court over a section of the ACA that requires employers to provide birth control coverage, which he opposes on religious grounds.\n\nHe told MiBiz that he plans to drop Autocam Corp. from the lawsuit due to its soon-to-be status as a public company. However, he will continue the suit with Autocam Medical because of the recent Supreme Court ruling in the Hobby Lobby case that stated \u201cclosely-held\u201d corporations were exempt from the mandate.\n\nDescribing the acquisition as a \u201ccompelling strategic transaction,\u201d Kennedy said he expected it would create \u201cenormous opportunity\u201d for the combined company, which is expected \u201cto outgrow its end markets by taking advantage of global market trends in fuel efficient technologies.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are even more bullish with NN as a partner and their access to capital,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will be able to manage and grow the business.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "While Autocam Corp. will be acquired by a Tennessee-based public company in a deal that was announced in July, the automotive supplier does not expect...", "generator": "runengine.com", "title": "Autocam brand to live on after acquisition", "og": {"url": "https://mibiz.com/item/21720-autocam-brand-to-live-on-after-acquisition", "image": "http://mibiz.com/media/k2/items/cache/49926aa1d1b1c2798e8ff499af085a04_XL.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "While Autocam Corp. will be acquired by a Tennessee-based public company in a deal that was announced in July, the automotive supplier does not expect...", "title": "Autocam brand to live on after acquisition"}, "image": "https://mibiz.com/media/k2/items/cache/49926aa1d1b1c2798e8ff499af085a04_S.jpg", "rights": "www.MiBiz.com", "author": "Nick Manes", "keywords": "Mergers and acquisitions,Autocam Corp,automotive supply chain", "original-source": "https://mibiz.com/item/21720-autocam-brand-to-live-on-after-acquisition"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf89d\"", "article_summary": "Autocam is also expected to continue its employee training programs, which aim to develop a skilled workforce for the company, he said.\nThe Autocam brand will continue on after the transaction.\nHe told MiBiz that he plans to drop Autocam Corp. from the lawsuit due to its soon-to-be status as a public company.\nAutocam was also in the news of late for the company\u2019s challenge to the Affordable Care Act.\nThe deal, which is expected to close in the third quarter and is subject to regulatory approval, does not include the Autocam Medical division, which will remain under Kennedy\u2019s ownership."}
