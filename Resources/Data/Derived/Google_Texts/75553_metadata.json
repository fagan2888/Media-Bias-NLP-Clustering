He\u2019s even talking about getting rid of the federal minimum wage and leaving it to the states, to the mercy of Republican governors who\u2019ve already cut wages for state workers.\u201d\n\nClinton was referring to a Republican debate in November when Trump said, \u201cTaxes too high, wages too high, we're not going to be able to compete against the world.\u201d On ABC's This Week on Sunday, Trump said he was changing his position, which he didn't flesh out other than to say \u201cpeople have to get more\u201d wages.\n\nClinton's message indicated that she intends to highlight Trump's original position rather than his shift on the minimum wage.

And if somebody has a better idea then of course we will listen to it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith somebody like Donald Trump,\u201d she said, \u201cyou\u2019d see a race to the bottom across the country with working families paying the price.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "sailthru.author": "Sahil Kapur", "description": "Hillary Clinton went after Donald Trump during a speech Tuesday at Family Health Centers in Louisville, Kentucky, previewing her general-election message by assailing him for having said wages are \u201ctoo high.\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Bloomberg.com/politics", "description": "Hillary Clinton went after Donald Trump during a speech Tuesday at Family Health Centers in Louisville, Kentucky, previewing her general-election message by assailing him for having said wages are \u201ctoo high.\u201d", "title": "Clinton Attacks Trump on Minimum Wage in Kentucky", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/trackers/2016-05-10/in-louisville-clinton-attacks-trump-on-the-minimum-wage", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iK1mE.kDlRdA/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "type": "website"}, "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/trackers/2016-05-10/in-louisville-clinton-attacks-trump-on-the-minimum-wage", "twitter": {"description": "Hillary Clinton went after Donald Trump during a speech Tuesday at Family Health Centers in Louisville, Kentucky, previewing her general-election message by assailing him for having said wages are \u201ctoo high.\u201d", "title": "Clinton Attacks Trump on Minimum Wage in Kentucky", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/trackers/2016-05-10/in-louisville-clinton-attacks-trump-on-the-minimum-wage", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iK1mE.kDlRdA/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "site": "@bpolitics", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "Kentucky,Minimum Wage,Hillary Diane Rodham Clinton,Donald John Trump", "fb": {"status": "Hillary Clinton went after Donald Trump during a speech Tuesday at Family Health Centers in Louisville, Kentucky, previewing her general-election message by assailing him for having said wages are \u201ctoo high.\u201d"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "parsely-title": "Clinton Attacks Trump on Minimum Wage in Kentucky", "parsely-tags": "Kentucky,Minimum Wage,Hillary Diane Rodham Clinton,Donald John Trump,Region: Global,Page: tracker", "parsely-post-id": "O6ZBCB6JTSEI01", "parsely-author": "Sahil Kapur", "parsely-type": "post", "date": "2016-05-10T20:52:59.456Z", "parsely-section": "politics", "news_keywords": "Kentucky,Minimum Wage,Hillary Diane Rodham Clinton,Donald John Trump", "parsely-image-url": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iK1mE.kDlRdA/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "parsely-pub-date": "2016-05-10T20:52:59.456Z"}, "article_summary": "\u201cDonald Trump actually stood on a debate stage and argued that Americans are being paid too much, not to little.\nClinton's message indicated that she intends to highlight Trump's original position rather than his shift on the minimum wage.\n\u201cDonald Trump wants to get rid of the Affordable Care Act,\u201d she said, also attacking Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin for \u201cworking hard to undermine\u201d the state's ACA exchange, called Kynect.\nThe Democratic front-runner also went after Trump for proposing to repeal Obamacare.\n\u201cIn many places dog trainers are paid more than child care workers,\u201d Clinton said, drawing gasps from the crowd of health-care workers."}
