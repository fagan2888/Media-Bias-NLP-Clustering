â€” A North Carolina State Highway Patrol trooper was injured when the driver of an all-terrain vehicle attacked the trooper with the machine, officials said.

The incident occurred at 2 a.m. Saturday in Rowan County, according to a news release from the Highway Patrol. A state trooper was on routine patrol when he spotted and attempted to stop two ATVs in a travel lane on N.C Highway 153.

The ATV drivers stopped in a subdivision, and the trooper exited his vehicle and approached. As the trooper walked, one of the drivers drove at the trooper, hitting him. The driver then turned around and tried to hit the trooper a second time.

The trooper then shot at the suspect, which caused both the ATV drivers to flee the scene.

According to the Highway Patrol, the trooper received serious but non-life threatening injuries and was transported to Carolinas Medical Center-Northeast in Concord. His name was not released.

Investigators are asking for any information that might help identify the suspect. Anyone with information is asked to call the Highway Patrol communications center at 1-800-233-3151.
