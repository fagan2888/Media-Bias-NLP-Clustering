The deal kicks in when 55 countries representing at least 55 percent of worldwide carbon emissions \u201cjoin\u201d the deal, and the signatures affixed to the deal Friday were simply the prelude to that step.\n\no \u201cThere is some concern globally about where we\u2019re headed,\u201d said Jonathan Pershing who represents the U.S. Special Envoy for Climate Change. Pershing and others attended meetings at the UN over the weekend to mark the signing of the Paris climate deal.\n\no Despite the concerns, Pershing said, \u201cI think we were able to really address it with a couple of really telling points that were persuasive for folks.\u201d\n\no He also said the U.S. will inevitably participate in a global clean energy market regardless of who is president, even if it\u2019s a Republican dismissive of climate change, as leading candidates Donald Trump and Ted Cruz are.\n\no Administration officials have long warned the GOP not to let Obama\u2019s climate commitments lapse if a Republican take office. Pershing\u2019s predecessor, Todd Stern, said in February there would be \u201cdiplomatic consequences\u201d if the next president pulls out of the climate deal, which was signed in New York on Friday.\n\nOBAMACARE BLUNDERS Health insurance companies are laying the groundwork for substantial increases in ObamaCare premiums, opening up a line of attack for Republicans in this heated presidential election year.\n\no Many insurers have been losing money on the ObamaCare marketplaces, in part because they set their premiums too low when the plans started in 2014. The companies are now expected to seek substantial price increases.\n\no Insurers are already making the case for premium increases, pointing to a pool of enrollees that is smaller, sicker and costlier than they expected.\n\no Blue Cross Blue Shield released a widely publicized report last month that said new enrollees under ObamaCare had 22 percent higher medical costs than people who received coverage through their employers.\n\no Still, even talk of premium increases provides an opening for Republicans who are campaigning against the Affordable Care Act (ACA) as they seek to hold their majorities in Congress and win back the White House.\n\no The prominence of the premium hike issue in the campaign could depend on whether Donald Trump or Ted Cruz (or someone else) is the Republican nominee.\n\no The Obama administration has sought to get out in front of the coming ObamaCare premium hikes, in part by downplaying their likely impact.\n\no ObamaCare premiums rose an average of 8 percent between 2015 and 2016, but once the tax credits were factored in, consumers on average ended up paying just 4 percent more: $106 per month compared to $102 per month.\n\no Large premium increases were also common before ObamaCare. Back then, people could be denied coverage due to preexisting conditions, meaning some people could not obtain coverage for any price. ObamaCare premiums came in about 15 percent below expectations in the first year of the new coverage, in 2014.\n\nMINIMUM WAGE BACKLASH The University of California at Berkeley\u2019s plan to fire 500 workers a week after the state voted to raise the minimum wage is said to be an \u2018unlikely\u2019 coincidence.\n\no \u201cThe school was already in financial trouble it ran a $109 million deficit last year and is projecting a deficit of $150 million this year,\u201d the financial newspaper said in an editorial. \u201cBut number crunchers at the school had to have factored in the higher mandated wages when making their layoff decisions.\u201d\n\no California Gov. Jerry Brown in April signed into law a 50 percent increase in the minimum pay rate to $15 an hour by 2022, saying, \u201cMorally and socially and politically, they (minimum wages) make every sense because it binds the community together and makes sure that parents can take care of their kids in a much more satisfactory way,\u201d according to the Sacramento Bee.\n\no A week after the wage hike was signed into law, Nicholas Dirks, chancellor of the flagship of liberal academia, sent a memo to UC Berkeley employees announcing that 500 jobs were getting cut over the next two years.\n\no UC Berkeley\u2019s Center for Labor Research touted a hike in the minimum wage as a boon to low-income household breadwinners in a March 30 report.\n\no \u201cThis is a very big deal for low-wage workers in California, for their families and for their children,\u201d Ken Jacobs, chairman of the UC Berkeley center, told the Los Angeles Times after the report was published.\n\nCHEAP OIL AND THE IMF The International Monetary Fund estimates the Middle East\u2019s oil-dependent economies have missed out on $390 billion in oil revenues last year alone and face up to $150 billion in income losses this year as a result of cheap oil prices.\n\no The drop in revenues stemming from the export of oil is the direct result of the plunge in crude prices from around $115 a barrel in the middle of 2014 to below $30 at the start of the year and is now above $40.\n\no The loss in potential revenues has put an enormous strain on the economies of major oil exporters such as Saudi Arabia and Kuwait who have posted massive budget deficits in the past year. The IMF had previously calculated that the declining energy prices would erase around $360 billion in oil receipts.\n\no To overcome these gaping budget deficits, Persian Gulf countries have introduced a raft of measures ranging from cutting energy subsidies to raising taxes. Some, such as Saudi Arabia, have also burned through their foreign reserves or started to borrow internationally to ease the fiscal pressures.\n\no Economic growth for the region\u2019s oil exporters is set to rise to 3% in 2016 from 2% last year but that is mainly due to the improved prospects of Iraq, which increased oil production, and Iran, which is looking to benefit from the gradual lifting of sanctions, the IMF said.\n\no For the oil-rich Persian Gulf countries, economic activity is expected to further slow as governments are cutting spending to rein in widening budget deficits.\n\nNO GROUNDWAR IN SYRIA? President Obama said that sending 250 additional troops to Syria doesn\u2019t constitute a change in the United States\u2019 mission there.\n\no Obama told CBS News\u2019s Charlie Rose that, \u201cas a general rule,\u201d American troops will not be fighting directly with Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) forces in that country. Instead, they will beef up the train-and-advise mission that is already underway.\n\no \u201cAs a general rule, their role is not to engage directly with the enemy but rather to work with local forces that is consistent with our overall policy throughout,\u201d Obama said.\n\no The president\u2019s decision has drawn some scrutiny from some critics, who are wary of U.S. mission creep inside of Syria.\n\no They are worried American forces could get caught in a quagmire; Syria has been wracked by a civil war for five years, leaving a power vacuum that contributed to ISIS\u2019s rise.\n\no Despite the administration\u2019s insistence the U.S. isn\u2019t fighting the ground war against ISIS, special forces have participated in targeted raids on the ground in Syria.\n\no Obama this week ruled out sending in U.S. ground forces to overthrow Syrian President Bashar Assad.\n\no \u201cIt would be a mistake for the United States, for Great Britain, for a combination of Western states to send in ground troops and overthrow the Assad regime,\u201d Obama added.\n\nTHE BATHROOM BATTLE CONTINUES Four Democratic lawmakers in North Carolina\u2019s House of Representatives have introduced a measure to repeal the state\u2019s controversial House Bill 2, otherwise known as the Public Facilities Privacy & Security Act, which prohibits transgender people from using the bathroom in accordance with their gender identities.\n\no The bill, known as House Bill 946, would undo HB 2 in its entirety and appropriate $545,407 to the state\u2019s Human Relations Commission, an office within the Department of Administration that enforces equal opportunities in employment, housing, public accommodations, recreation, education, justice, and governmental services.\n\no It was filed by Reps. Darren Jackson, Graig Meyer, Susi Hamilton and Grier Martin, who said in a press conference Monday morning that \u201cHB2 goes against everything I know about my fellow North Carolinians.\u201d\n\no Outside the general assembly yesterday hundreds of HB 2 supporters and opponents rallied to mark the return of the state legislature for the first time since it passed the so-called \u201cbathroom law\u201d last month during a special session. A coalition of organizations opposed to HB 2 delivered 185,000 signatures calling for the law to be overturned, according to the Charlotte Observer. Supporters of the measure, meanwhile, gathered for a packed concert and rally on the Halifax Mall in downtown Raleigh.\n\no Since it was hastily passed and signed into law last month, HB 2 has been the focus of a growing national backlash against the Tar Heel State, with numerous celebrities, businesses and sports organizations calling for the law\u2019s repeal. Proponents insist HB 2 is necessary to protect the privacy and safety of people (usually young girls) from potential predators in the bathroom. Yet critics say the law hurts the LGBT community by nullifying all local nondiscrimination ordinances that offered protections based on sexual orientation and gender identity, while also requiring people to use government building bathrooms in line with the sex listed on their birth certificates.\n\no For most people, that regulation poses no problem. But for transgender people, whose expressed or experienced gender differs from the sex listed on their birth certificates, it forces them to use the bathroom that conflicts with their identity.\n\nTSA GUNS RECORD Airport screeners established a new record last week when they stopped passengers from boarding planes with 73 firearms in carry-on luggage.\n\no The Transportation Security Administration officials said the number was reached in the seven days ending on April 21st and the haul surpassed the previous high of 68 set in October 2015.\n\no After confiscating the 73 firearms, TSA carry-on screeners made a startling discovery: 68 of the weapons were loaded and more than two dozen had a round in the chamber.\n\no Two loaded guns were seized at Boston Logan Airport on Tuesday and Thursday.\n\no Other airports where weapons were found included Raleigh-Durham, Dallas-Fort Worth, Phoenix and Detroit.\n\no Two replica military rounds also were discovered in a checked bag at Tucson, the TSA reported.\n\no Federal law bars guns in carry-on bags, but they can be transported in checked luggage if they are unloaded and declared to the airline before the flight departs.\n\nCALIFORNIA LAWS California lawmakers are considering fines of as much of $1,500 for jurors who tweet about trials or research a case on Google, after court officials argued that misbehaving citizens have caused mistrials and overturned convictions around the country.\n\no As jurors and judges have become more technology savvy in recent years, the perils playing around with their smartphones have become a mounting concern, particularly in California. A 2011 state law made improper electronic or wireless communication or research by a juror punishable by contempt.\n\no Supporters of the latest proposal say a potential fine would give teeth to existing prohibitions against using social media and the internet, and would simplify the process for holding wayward jurors accountable.\n\no But critics question whether it will have any practical effect on jurors who are constantly on sites such as Facebook and Twitter. They suggest judges vet the social media activity of potential jurors before seating them.\n\no It is not clear exactly how many times juror social media or internet use has affected trials. But anecdotal evidence suggests it is more than sporadic.\n\no Eric Robinson, co-director of the Press Law and Democracy Project at Louisiana State University, said he used to track cases of juror social media or internet misconduct using news accounts and other sources, but there were so many \u201cit got to be more trouble than it was worth\u201d.\n\no \u201cThose are the ones we hear about,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m sure it happens a lot more.\u201d\n\nTHE ISLAMIC STATE\u2019S KILL LIST The Islamic State has distributed a \"kill list\" containing the names of U.S. government personnel at the Pentagon, State Department, and Department of Homeland Security, as well as several other federal agencies.\n\no The 43 names were distributed by the United Cyber Caliphate over a smartphone messaging application called Telegram, and were accompanied by phone numbers, cities and zip codes.\n\no Street addresses were not included, and some of the information was affiliated with offices where the targets are employed. The words \"wanted to be killed\" were included in English, Arabic, French, Spanish and Russian.\n\no Other targets included personnel at the Departments of Energy, Commerce and Health and Human Services. Targets outside of Washington include staff at the\n\no Though the cyber division of the Islamic State is often dubbed a \"hacking\" organization, there is little evidence of any sophisticated technical ability. However, the distribution of kill lists over Telegram has become a standard practice for the group. The names of police officers in Minnesota were released in March, while a list of U.S. officials was released in November.\n\nFELON RIGHTS CONTINUES Attorney General Loretta Lynch said states should make it easier for convicted felons to obtain state-issued identification after they get out of prison setting measures aimed at helping smooth the return to society for the hundreds of thousands of inmates released each year.\n\no State laws vary on the voting eligibility of people convicted of crimes. Nearly 6 million Americans are unable to vote because of their criminal backgrounds, though more than 20 states have acted in the last two decades to help those with criminal convictions vote.\n\no The announcement is part of a broader movement to undo criminal justice policies that have meted out exceptionally long sentences for drug offenders, caused prison populations to balloon and, advocates say, created unnecessary barriers for ex-convicts looking to rebuild their lives. It amplifies an ongoing Justice Department push to rethink harsh drug sentences and to ensure alternatives to prison for certain nonviolent defendants, an effort known as \"Smart on Crime.\"\n\no \"The long-term impact of a criminal record prevents many people from obtaining employment, housing, higher education and credit and these barriers affect returning individuals even if they have turned their lives around and are unlikely to reoffend,\" the department said in a seven-page policy statement titled \"Roadmap to Re-entry.\"\n\no The issue of felons' rights has attracted growing attention at the state and federal levels in recent years. Last week, Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe issued an executive order that would allow more than 200,000 convicted felons to cast ballots in November, calling voting rights the \"essence of our democracy.\"\n\no The Obama administration, meanwhile, has created a federal re-entry council that looks for ways to reduce hurdles for people leaving prison.\n\no A letter released by the Justice Department calls on governors of all states to allow federal inmates who are returning to their communities to exchange their prisoner identification cards for state-issued identification, or to simply accept their prison cards as supporting documentation to obtain a state ID.\n\no Without identity documents, Americans leaving prison face challenges in getting jobs, housing or opening bank accounts, Lynch wrote in a sample letter provided by the Justice Department.\n\nCABLE MERGER The Department of Justice and the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission approved Charter Communications\u2019 $78 billion takeover of Time Warner Cable and its $10.4 billion purchase of Bright House Networks.\n\no The government agencies attached several conditions to the approval and the deal will affect one in six American households.\n\no The full FCC still needs to vote to accept Chairman Tom Wheeler's recommendation, but the vote is believed to be a formality in this case.\n\no Once the deal is complete, Charter will stand next to Comcast, AT&T, and Verizon as a media giant shaping the future of television-watching and web-surfing.\n\no \"We are pleased to reach this critical step in the regulatory review of our merger with Charter,\" Time Warner Cable CEO Rob Marcus said, \"and remain optimistic that the transaction will be finalized soon.\"\n\no The purchase was proposed almost a year ago, after Comcast's bid to combine with Time Warner Cable fell apart amid stiff opposition from Washington.\n\no The same regulators were more supportive of Charter's bid for Time Warner Cable but with important caveats.\n\no Charter will be prohibited from putting data caps in place or charging customers based on usage.\n\no Additionally, the company won't be allowed to charge internet content providers fees for connecting them to customers.\n\no The conditions will apply for seven years to \"focus on removing unfair barriers to video competition.\u201d\n\no Tom Rutledge, Charter's CEO, will run the enlarged company. He initially hoped the deal would be approved by the end of 2015, but the process has taken a long time.\n\no Now Charter is eyeing a mid- to late-May completion date. Along with the FCC vote, the company still needs approval from the California's Public Utilities Commission. A vote is scheduled for May 12.\n\nGANNETT MERGER . Gannett Co. which owns USA TODAY and more than 100 other media properties across the country has offered to buy Tribune Publishing for about $815 million, its second big expansion move since spinning off from its former parent less than a year ago.\n\no In a letter to Justin Dearborn, CEO of Tribune, which owns the Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune and nine other dailies, Gannett CEO Robert Dickey reiterated a private April 12 offer to pay $12.25 per share, a 63% premium to Tribune\u2019s closing stock price last Friday. Gannett\u2019s deal includes assuming $390 million of Tribune\u2019s debt outstanding as of Dec. 31, 2015.\n\no The offer price is about 5.6 times Tribune\u2019s estimated 2016 earnings before interest, taxes and other items. Gannett estimates about $50 million a year in \u201csynergies\u201d savings. Gannett owns USA TODAY plus 107 local news organizations including the Detroit Free Press, Cincinnati Enquirer, Des Moines Register, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel and Arizona Republic.\n\no \u201cWe believe Tribune shares the new Gannett\u2019s unwavering commitment to journalistic excellence and delivering superior content on all platforms,\u201d Dickey said in a statement Monday. \u201cIn this respect, the proposed combination of Gannett and Tribune would bring together two highly complementary organizations with a shared goal of providing trusted, premium content for the readers and communities we serve.\u201d\n\nMELISSA CLICK IS AT IT AGAIN Missouri Professor Melissa Click suggested in a newspaper profile that she was fired because she\u2019s white woman.\n\no Click was fired from her position as an assistant professor of communications in February, and her appeal of the decision was denied in March. She achieved national attention after video footage of her assaulting a student journalist went viral. Later, video emerged of her yelling profanities at a police officer.\n\no \u201cThis is all about racial politics,\u201d Click said in the Chronicle of Higher Education article. \u201cI\u2019m a white lady. I\u2019m an easy target.\u201d\n\no Her confrontation with a student journalist attempting to cover campus protests in November was caught on the journalist\u2019s camera.\n\no \u201cI\u2019m not a superhero,\u201d Click told The Chronicle. \u201cI wasn\u2019t in charge. When it got out of control, I was the one held accountable.\u201d\n\no Her incident with police in October, during a protest at the university\u2019s homecoming parade, was caught on an officer\u2019s body camera.\n\no \u201cAm I going to be one of those people who stands and watches another brutal moment against black people, or am I going to step in and make sure they\u2019re safe?\u201d Click said she asked herself before stepping between the police officer and a protester.\n\no \u201cBlack people love me,\u201d she\u2019s quoted as telling a reporter.\n\no Click said the media treated her unfairly, and if she were to write a headline for her story it would have been \u201cFavorite Professor Fights to Support Black Students on Campus in Dangerous Situation.\u201d\n\nSPANKING DOES MORE HARM THAN GOOD The more children are spanked, the more likely they are to defy their parents and to experience increased anti-social behavior, aggression, mental health problems and cognitive difficulties, according to a new meta-analysis of 50 years of research on spanking by experts at the University of Texas at Austin and the University of Michigan.\n\no The study looks at five decades of research involving over 160,000 children. The researchers say it is the most complete analysis to date of the outcomes associated with spanking, and more specific to the effects of spanking alone than previous papers, which included other types of physical punishment in their analyses.\n\no \"Our analysis focuses on what most Americans would recognize as spanking and not on potentially abusive behaviors,\" says Elizabeth Gershoff, an associate professor of human development and family sciences at The University of Texas at Austin. \"We found that spanking was associated with unintended detrimental outcomes and was not associated with more immediate or long-term compliance, which are parents' intended outcomes when they discipline their children.\"\n\no Gershoff and co-author Andrew Grogan-Kaylor, an associate professor at the University of Michigan School of Social Work, found that spanking (defined as an open-handed hit on the behind or extremities) was significantly linked with 13 of the 17 outcomes they examined, all in the direction of detrimental outcomes.\n\no \"The upshot of the study is that spanking increases the likelihood of a wide variety of undesired outcomes for children. Spanking thus does the opposite of what parents usually want it to do,\" Grogan-Kaylor says.\n\no Gershoff and Grogan-Kaylor tested for some long-term effects among adults who were spanked as children. The more they were spanked, the more likely they were to exhibit anti-social behavior and to experience mental health problems. They were also more likely to support physical punishment for their own children, which highlights one of the key ways that attitudes toward physical punishment are passed from generation to generation.\n\no The researchers looked at a wide range of studies and noted that spanking was associated with negative outcomes consistently and across all types of studies, including those using the strongest methodologies such as longitudinal or experimental designs.\n\no As many as 80 percent of parents around the world spank their children, according to a 2014 UNICEF report. Gershoff notes that this persistence of spanking is in spite of the fact that there is no clear evidence of positive effects from spanking and ample evidence that it poses a risk of harm to children's behavior and development.\n\nU.S. EMBASSY WORKER HACKED TO DEATH A U.S. Embassy worker and editor of Bangladesh's first LGBT magazine was among two men hacked to death yesterday evening in Dhak.\n\no A statement from the U.S. Embassy identified the man as Xulhaz Mannan, calling him a \"dear friend.\"\n\no \"We abhor this senseless act of violence and urge the Government of Bangladesh in the strongest terms to apprehend the criminals behind these murders,\" said Marcia Stephens Bloom Bernicat, the U.S. ambassador to Bangladesh.\n\no Mannan and someone described only as a friend were in a flat in Dhaka when five or six young men posing as couriers arrived at Mannan's building under the guise of delivering a package, said Mohammad Iqbal, officer in charge of the Kalabagan police station.\n\no They entered the second-floor apartment and hacked Mannan and his friend to death with machetes, Iqbal said. Mannan's mother and a maid were also in the flat at the time, he said. Both are alive.\n\nDEFLATEGATE REINSTATE A U.S. appeals court restored the four-game \"Deflategate\" suspension of New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, handing the National Football League a victory in the latest round in a battle with one of its marquee players.\n\no The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York reversed a federal judge's ruling that had overturned NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell's decision to penalize Brady, twice the league's most valuable player, over his alleged involvement in a scheme to deflate footballs used in a 2015 playoff game.\n\no The Patriots won that game over the Indianapolis Colts, sending them to the Super Bowl, where they defeated the defending champion Seattle Seahawks to give Brady his fourth championship title.\n\no Writing for the majority, U.S. Circuit Judge Barrington Parker said that under the players' collective bargaining agreement, Goodell had \"especially broad\" authority as an arbitrator to decide whether to confirm Brady's suspension.\n\no \"Our review of the record yields the firm conclusion that the Commissioner properly exercised his broad discretion to resolve an intramural controversy between the League and a player,\" Parker wrote.\n\no Neither the Patriots, nor representatives for Brady were immediately available to comment on the ruling. The National Football League Players Association, the union which pursued the court challenge, said in a statement it was disappointed and would \"consider all of our options.\"\n\no The ruling came in a 2-1 vote by the three-judge panel, and followed arguments last month where a lawyer for the players' union faced tough questioning that signaled the likely reversal of U.S. District Judge Richard Berman's ruling.\n\nPAUL RYAN\u2019S AGENDA Paul Ryan plans to roll out a policy platform this spring and has already been trying to build a social media and youth movement around the House Republican agenda.\n\no This week, Mr. Ryan will participate in a town-hall-style event at the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service. In advance of that event, his office has rolled out its latest video holding up Mr. Ryan as a man with a plan, though the details of that plan, obliquely intended to distract from the presidential campaign of Donald J. Trump, are very much a work in progress.\n\no While Mr. Ryan has repeatedly said that he has no intention of becoming his party\u2019s nominee this year, he has been busy creating a personality and policy alternative to run alongside the presidential effort to provide both a platform for House Republicans to run on and a foundation to rebuild if Republicans fall apart in November.\n\no Mr. Ryan is not a candidate. But his videos continue to make it seem as if he is running for something.\n\nSTARBUCKS OUTRAGE After many Starbucks employees voiced concern, the company has announced a new plan to donate 100 percent of its unsold food to charity within five years.\n\no Many Starbucks stores were already donating their pastries, which can easily be bagged and dropped off at nearby charities. But creating a program to include perishable items gathered from thousands of stores nationwide was a challenge.\n\no The federal government believes 30 to 40 percent of the nation's food supply is wasted a year. In 2014, nearly one in seven Americans lived in households that at some point were unsure where the next meal would come from.\n\no Feeding America is the nation's largest domestic hunger-relief and food-rescue organization. In 2015, its network of warehouses, food banks and food pantries saved over two billion pounds of edible food that might otherwise have gone to waste.\n\no After a year of research and food safety testing, Starbucks recently rolled out food-donation pilot programs in Arizona and California. In San Diego, Jellison manages one of 30 Starbucks locations now donating all of their perishable foods every day\n\nPolitical Noise/Right Solutions and P.R.A.Y for Tuesday, 4-26-2016\n\nCLINTON \u2018S LACK OF LIKEABILITY Women are increasingly turning their noses up at the 2016 election, including Democratic women despite the likelihood that their party's nominee will be one of them, according to a new Gallup survey.\n\no Women have never paid as much attention to the current race as men, but Gallup found that the attention gap has expanded in recent months.\n\no Once just two points apart, in February, the gap is now 13 points and is seen in both Democratic and Republican ranks as men continue to be engaged in the election dominated by news coverage of Republican Donald Trump.\n\no Gallup said that 44 percent of men, compared to 31 percent of women, are paying close attention to the race.\n\no \"The gender gap persists within both parties. An aggregated analysis of March and April responses shows that Republican men are eight points more likely than Republican women to be following the election very closely, while Democratic men are 11 points more likely than Democratic women,\" said Gallup.\n\no \"Pure independents \u2014 those who do not lean to either party \u2014 are following the news less closely than those in either party, regardless of gender, as would be expected. But even with overall lower levels of interest, independent men are significantly more likely than independent women to say they are following the news very closely,\" added the survey analysis.\n\no Gallup blamed the lack of female candidates for women paying less attention, though that doesn't explain the low interest among Democrats who are likely to nominate their first woman as the party candidate. What's more, several groups that support women's issues, such as Planned Parenthood and Emily's List have been very public about backing Clinton.\n\no But, just 30 percent of Democratic women are paying attention to the race, compared to 44 percent of Republican women.\n\n1/38 KASICH Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump coined a new nickname for rival John Kasich: \"1 for 38 Kasich.\"\n\no \"Lyin' Ted Cruz and 1 for 38 Kasich are unable to beat me on their own so they have to team up (collusion) in a two on one. Shows weakness!\" Trump tweeted.\n\no \"Shows how weak and desperate Lyin' Ted is when he has to team up with a guy who openly can't stand him and is only 1 win and 38 losses,\" he tweeted minutes later.\n\no His tweets come a day after Cruz and Kasich announced a coordinated strategy to split the upcoming primary states in hopes of denying Trump the nomination.

At this point, no decisions have been made in terms of who a nominee would be.

She says the death of Officer Smith made her think about her own family.\n\no \u201cHe [Officer Smith] left behind a wife and kids. It could\u2019ve been me.

You walk the thin blue line. Be safe and go home to your family. Don\u2019t ever worry I have your six.\"\n\no The Lakewood Police Department posted the touching note to their Facebook page:\n\no The phrase - which originated with World War I pilots who referenced the rear of an airplane as the six o'clock position - is a military and law enforcement term meaning \"I\u2019ve got your back.\"\n\no O'Hayre and Steffes joined Maria Bartiromo today, and the officer revealed that the note had more than heartfelt sentiment.

It\u2019s been 43 years. Forty-three years.\u201d\n\no Monroe has spent the better part of the past two decades using metal detectors to search for objects in the ground. Over the years, he\u2019s amassed quite a collection. Old pharmacy bottles, marbles, garter belt clips. He\u2019s got a whole mess of Mormon \u201cCTR\u201d rings.\n\no Or, as his wife Natalie puts it: \u201cWe have nine kids \u2026 and lots and lots of boxes of junk he\u2019s dug up.\u201d\n\no Recently, Monroe, 41, had been metal detecting in Ogden\u2019s Liberty Park, where much of the grass has been removed during construction of a new school in the area. On Sunday morning, Monroe was using his detector to sweep an area of the park when he came across a Clearfield High School class ring from 1973. Inside were inscribed the initials \u201cBLM.\u201d\n\no Monroe immediately set Natalie on the trail of tracking down the owner. She contacted Clearfield High, and was able to page through a 1973 yearbook at Clearfield High. Two females and two males from that class shared the initials BM. Since it was a smaller ring, the Monroes figured they were probably looking for a female. One, they couldn\u2019t find. The other was Jensen. Once the Monroes learned Jensen\u2019s full maiden name was Bonni Lynne Melaney \u2014 BLM \u2014 they were pretty certain they\u2019d found their owner.\n\nA DIVINE SONOGRAM An Indiana mother-to-be received what some are calling a divine surprise after a prenatal checkup!\n\no A sonogram of Aley Meyer's baby boy appears to show an image of Jesus on the cross.\n\no Meyer told WFIE that she didn't even notice until about a week later when someone pointed it out at her baby shower.\n\no \"We took a picture of it and blew it up on my phone to get a closer look, and it is so much detail.
