The city asked hundreds of thousands of residents not to drink the water until Monday morning, while state and federal emergency officials brought in bottled water.\n\nToledo\u2019s water ban echoed an incident earlier in the year in Charleston, W.Va., when a chemical used to clean coal leaked into the river where the city took its water, leading to widespread drinking bans. But Toledo\u2019s issues were caused by a variety of factors including the runoff, not by a single leak like Charleston\u2019s.\n\nJon Devine, a senior attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said better protection of bodies of water is the least the country could do to prevent future water pollution problems.\n\n\u201cCertainly, the laws and our rules can be strengthened with respect to nitrogen and phosphorus pollution in a number of ways,\u201d he said.\n\nEnvironmental groups want new rules dictating the ingredients in fertilizer, the amount of fertilizer farmers could use or the places particular nutrients could be applied.\n\nThe agriculture community recognizes its role in the problem, but would rather avoid new rules.\n\nDon Parrish, senior director of regulatory relations at the American Farm Bureau Federation, said farmers take many precautions in an effort to avoid wasting fertilizer and other nutrients.\n\n\u201cWe try to apply the best science possible. But we\u2019re still dealing with a natural system,\u201d he said.\n\nParrish called new regulations a \u201cshort-term solution.\u201d\n\nIf the government encouraged farmers to use more exact methods for applying nutrients, that would be a long-term solution, he said.\n\nToledo\u2019s water crisis came as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is considering its Waters of the United States rule, which would ensure that streams that run dry half the year would be subject to protections under the Clean Water Act.\n\nGreen groups say this rule would provide additional protections for the nation\u2019s water supply.\n\n\u201cEPA and the Corps have proposed a rule that would guarantee that tributary streams and many wetlands around the country that are in legal limbo today would be protected against destruction and pollution by the programs of the Clean Water Act,\u201d Devine said.\n\nIn a conference call with reporters Monday, Sen. Rob Portman Rob PortmanJuan Williams: Electoral map looks grim for Trump McConnell touts 'Senate squad' in Wes Anderson-style video Liberal super-PAC hits Johnson for supporting Trump MORE (R-Ohio) recognized that agricultural runoff likely played a role in the crisis but did not call for government rules. Portman spent much of the weekend in Toledo helping deliver water and resolve the problem.\n\n\u201cThe science is pretty clear that it\u2019s nutrients in the water that cause the growth of these algal blooms, in addition to the weather conditions, how warm the water is and so on,\u201d he said.\n\nPortman called for the state and federal governments to research the issue and how to mitigate it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a complicated issue, and that\u2019s why I want to make sure we have the best science and we put it to use right away to be able to come up with better information about why these blooms are happening and where, specifically, some of these nutrients are coming from,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Green groups say Toledo highlights problems with agricultural chemicals.", "description": "Green groups say Toledo highlights problems with agricultural chemicals.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Timothy Cama", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Green groups say Toledo highlights problems with agricultural chemicals.", "title": "Toledo water ban raises runoff worries", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/214278-toledo-water-ban-raises-runoff-worries", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/ohiowater_080414getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-02T05:39:37-05:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/214278-toledo-water-ban-raises-runoff-worries", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Green groups say Toledo highlights problems with agricultural chemicals.", "card": "summary", "title": "Toledo water ban raises runoff worries"}, "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-02T05:39-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/214278-toledo-water-ban-raises-runoff-worries", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2014-08-05T06:00-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Ian Swanson", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-05T06:00:03-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-02T05:39:37-05:00"}, "keywords": "Environment, Water, Fertilizer,Rob Portman,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "dcterms.title": "Toledo water ban raises runoff worries"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdee6d\"", "article_summary": "While federal and state rules limit runoff pollution, environmentalists see Toledo\u2019s crisis as a major example of the need for further restrictions.\nToledo\u2019s water ban echoed an incident earlier in the year in Charleston, W.Va., when a chemical used to clean coal leaked into the river where the city took its water, leading to widespread drinking bans.\nJon Devine, a senior attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said better protection of bodies of water is the least the country could do to prevent future water pollution problems.\n\u201cBy and large, pollution from agriculture has not been as strictly regulated as pollution from other sources,\u201d she said, adding that Toledo\u2019s crisis calls for \u201cgreater vigilance\u201d on issues of runoff pollution.\nADVERTISEMENT\u201cThe situation in Toledo is terrible, and it certainly highlights the potential for serious problems across the country from agricultural runoff,\u201d said Sandra Levine, a senior attorney at the Conservation Law Institute."}
