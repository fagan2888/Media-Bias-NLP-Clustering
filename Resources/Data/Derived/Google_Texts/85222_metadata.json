The police van ride was 45 minutes long, with officials piecing together what happened that led to his death. Anger poured into the streets, where Gov. Larry Hogan declared a state of emergency and deployed the National Guard to maintain order. The State Attorney for Baltimore City, Marilyn Mosby, filed charges against the six police officers involved in Gray\u2019s death. Now, nearly three weeks after the charges being filed, the grand jury has decided to indict all of them (via Baltimore Sun):\n\nSome charges were slightly different than what Mosby announced on May 1. The grand jury review is a procedural step to move the case forward to a higher court, from District Court to Baltimore City Circuit Court. New charges included reckless endangerment, while charges of false imprisonment were removed by the grand jury. Officer Caesar R. Goodson, the driver of the van used to transport Gray on April 12, remains charged with second-degree depraved heart murder, which is the most serious charge among all six officers. He was also charged with manslaughter, second-degree assault, vehicular manslaughter -- gross negligence, vehicular manslaughter -- criminal negligence, misconduct in office and reckless endangerment, which is a new charge. Lt. Brian W. Rice was charged with manslaughter, second-degree assault, two counts of misconduct in office and reckless endangerment. A second-degree assault charge and false imprisonment charge Rice had been facing were removed. Sgt. Alicia D. White was charged with manslaughter, second-degree assault, misconduct in office and reckless endangerment, which is a new charge. Officer William Porter was charged with manslaughter, second-degree assault, misconduct in office and reckless endangerment, which is a new charge. Officer Garrett E. Miller was charged with second-degree assault, two counts of misconduct in office and reckless endangerment. A second-degree assault charge and false imprisonment charge were removed. Officer Edward M. Nero was charged with second-degree assault, two counts of misconduct in office and reckless endangerment. A second-degree assault charge and false imprisonment charge were removed. All six officers have been free on bail.\n\nPolice has reportedly been \u201chesitant\u201d to conduct their duties in Baltimore, leading to a surge in crime. As of three days ago, the rise in crime is ongoing, with Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake calling it \u201cdisheartening.\u201d\n\nThe mayor has also received criticism for saying \u201cwe also gave those who wished to destroy space to do that as well\u201d at the onset of the unrest; the first wave being on the night of the White House Correspondence Dinner on April 25. The more destructive phase of the rioting occurred two days later\u2013April 27\u2013when Gray was laid to rest.\n\nThe attorneys of the police officer had asked Ms. Mosby to recuse herself citing conflict of interest issues; the Gray's family attorney gave her a campaign contribution and was on her transition team. Mosby has also been criticized by some, especially the police union, for acting too hasty in bringing the charges against the officers.", "article_metadata": {"description": "New charges for some.05/27/2016 9:05:06AM EST.", "author": "Matt Vespa", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "New charges for some", "title": "-  Indicted: All Six Baltimore Police Officers Involved In The Death Of Freddie Gray Charged", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2015/05/21/indicted-all-six-baltimore-police-officers-involved-in-the-death-of-freddie-gray-charged-n2002407", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/128/75a50991-1664-461c-aaaf-fdcf6ca99f20.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "New charges for some", "title": "-  Indicted: All Six Baltimore Police Officers Involved In The Death Of Freddie Gray Charged", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2015/05/21/indicted-all-six-baltimore-police-officers-involved-in-the-death-of-freddie-gray-charged-n2002407", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/128/75a50991-1664-461c-aaaf-fdcf6ca99f20.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Indicted: All Six Baltimore Police Officers Involved In The Death Of Freddie Gray Charged , Matt Vespa, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "Alicia D.
