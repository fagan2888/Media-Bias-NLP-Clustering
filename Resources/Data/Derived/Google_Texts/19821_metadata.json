Mississippi, which ranked second-last, actually saw a 3.34% increase in its number of uninsured residents.The study, which considered data from Medicaid and a Kaiser Family Foundation report on previously uninsured Americans, offers an \u201cinitial projection of uninsured rates post-Obamacare\u201d for 43 states and the District of Columbia.While Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Hawaii, Oregon and West Virginia topped the list of most insured states, many more remained near the bottom. They include:That list hasn\u2019t changed much in recent years, but it is notable for states no longer hovering near the bottom. One of those is West Virginia, notes WalletHub CEO Odysseas Papadimitriou.\u201cWest Virginia used to be near the bottom every year, but it\u2019s gone from one of the worst to one of the best,\u201d Papadimitriou said, noting the state\u2019s nearly 11% reduction in uninsured residents. \u201cRhode Island is another, with close to 9% improvement.\u201dStill, the disparity between the most insured and most uninsured states is a little hard to swallow. In Massachusetts, the state with the fewest uninsured residents, just one in 100 people doesn\u2019t carry health insurance. In Texas, that ratio is one in four.It\u2019s upsetting, Papadimitriou says, and can be easily fixed.One of the biggest differentiating factors in these \u201cmost improved\u201d states is the expansion of Medicaid. That\u2019s something Papadimitriou says should be a clarion call to states that haven\u2019t chosen to grow the program for lower-income residents.\u201cIn order to make a dent in the uninsured population, states will have to expand Medicaid,\u201d he said. \u201cWith success stories like West Virginia, it\u2019s hard to make the case to your taxpayers that they should continue to foot the bill for others, but not for themselves.\u201dWalletHub was not able to analyze data for seven states, including Vermont, North Dakota, New Hampshire, Michigan, Maine, Delaware and Connecticut, due to differences in the timeline of Medicaid expansion and other factors.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.ibamag.com/news/the-10-most-uninsured-states-postobamacare-18933.aspx", "image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://www.ibamag.com/files/image/Insurance%20Business/us%20map.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 200}, "site_name": "Insurance Business", "description": "The premiere year of Obamacare significantly reduced the number of uninsured Americans, but these states still struggle.", "title": "The 10 most uninsured states post-Obamacare"}, "twitter": {"description": "The premiere year of Obamacare significantly reduced the number of uninsured Americans, but these states still struggle.", "title": "The 10 most uninsured states post-Obamacare", "url": "http://www.ibamag.com/news/the-10-most-uninsured-states-postobamacare-18933.aspx", "image": "http://www.ibamag.com/files/image/Insurance%20Business/us%20map.jpg", "site": "@InsuranceBizUS", "card": "summary"}, "description": "The premiere year of Obamacare significantly reduced the number of uninsured Americans, but these states still struggle.", "author": "Caitlin Bronson"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca85e\"", "article_summary": "\u201cRhode Island is another, with close to 9% improvement.\u201dStill, the disparity between the most insured and most uninsured states is a little hard to swallow.\nMississippi, which ranked second-last, actually saw a 3.34% increase in its number of uninsured residents.The study, which considered data from Medicaid and a Kaiser Family Foundation report on previously uninsured Americans, offers an \u201cinitial projection of uninsured rates post-Obamacare\u201d for 43 states and the District of Columbia.While Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Hawaii, Oregon and West Virginia topped the list of most insured states, many more remained near the bottom.\nThat\u2019s something Papadimitriou says should be a clarion call to states that haven\u2019t chosen to grow the program for lower-income residents.\u201cIn order to make a dent in the uninsured population, states will have to expand Medicaid,\u201d he said.\nThey include:That list hasn\u2019t changed much in recent years, but it is notable for states no longer hovering near the bottom.\nIn Massachusetts, the state with the fewest uninsured residents, just one in 100 people doesn\u2019t carry health insurance."}
