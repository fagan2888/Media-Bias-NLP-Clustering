( Getty Images )\n\nSome of the most commonly used drugs in the world to treat heartburn are associated with a 16 to 20 percent increased risk of heart attack, a large data mining study of electronic health records from Stanford researchers shows.\n\nThe class of drugs, called proton pump inhibitors or PPIs, are sold under the name Prilosec and Nexium, among others. These drugs are available by prescription as well as over the counter and generate an estimated $13 billion in annual sales globally.\n\nMore than 20 million Americans use a PPI, according to the study, which was published online in Plos One.\n\nDr. Nick Leeper, a cardiologist at Stanford and senior author of the study, stressed the research could not prove causation, \u201cbut I will say the association looks to be fairly compelling. What we have seen in this study is that PPI usage is very clearly associated with increased risk of heart attack.\u201d He said that only a randomized control trial, where patients either get the drug or a placebo, could prove causation.\n\nStill, the increased risk is \u201cabove baseline\u201d Leeper said. So if your personal risk is low \u2014 let\u2019s use 1 in 1,000 as an example \u2014 then increasing that risk 20 percent now makes your risk 1.2 in 1,000. The concern is that when that increased risk is multiplied across the millions of people taking the drug, some of whom are likely to be at higher risk of a heart attack.\n\nCombing Through Doctors\u2019 Notes\n\nThe researchers used a novel research technique. They designed algorithms to comb through the electronic health records (EHRs) of 3 million people across different data sets. This analysis looked beyond checked boxes that doctors often complain about when discussing EHRs.\n\n\u201cWe figured out a way to analyze the notes that doctors write about their patients during the course of care,\u201d said Nigam Shah, a study author and professor of bioinformatics at Stanford, \u201cand created a data structure which we (could) then analyze for associations that may have clinical significance.\u201d\n\nDoctors have known that people who take a PPI and also take the anti-platelet drug clopidogrel, known commercially as Plavix, are at increased risk of heart attack. This study excluded those patients and found the association among people not taking the second drug. The study did not show increased risk of heart attack in people taking a drug that fights heartburn in a different way, called an H2 blocker. That drug is sold under the name Zantac or Pepcid, among others.\n\nThe authors theorize that PPIs alter the metabolism of nitric oxide, which helps to regulate blood vessel function. \u201cIt\u2019s widely accepted that having reduced levels of nitric oxide is a bad thing and is associated with risks for cardiovascular events,\u201d Leeper said.\n\nStill, he cautioned that the research can only generate a hypothesis, which needs to be confirmed through additional studies.\n\nBarb Kochanowski is vice president of regulatory and scientific affairs with the Consumer Healthcare Products Association, a trade group for over-the-counter drug manufacturers. In a statement, she said that millions of consumers use these drugs. As with all over-the-counter medications, she said, \u201cconsumers should read the label and follow directions closely to understand what the medicine is used for, to ensure appropriate dosing and to avoid drug interactions.\u201d\n\nAstraZeneca, maker of Nexium, also issued a statement noting that all its medicines \u201care generally safe and effective when used in accordance with the label. \u2026 AstraZeneca was not consulted during the research and we cannot comment further on this data.\u201d\n\nNew Tool for Drug Safety Surveillance\n\nLeeper stressed that this study should not be seen as critical of pharmaceutical companies, which \u201csimply can\u2019t identify every harm,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we think these new approaches, where you can have post-approval surveillance, pharmacovigilance, this is where we really have the potential to figure out who\u2019s at risk, who\u2019s not, who\u2019s going to have an adverse outcome, who should be on different medicines.\u201d\n\nOther industries such as banking and airlines have been \u201clearning from the behavior and response of their customers\u201d for years, Shah said.\n\n\u201cHealth care is one of the few areas of the economy where we don\u2019t learn from routine (visits). You go in with acid reflux. I go in with acid reflux, 50,000 people go in with acid reflux, but the evidence on which doctors are making decisions are based on the 500 or 1,000 people who were enrolled in the randomized control trial. Why would we not learn from the collective record of what patients had and what doctors did to them that we\u2019re already collecting in the electronic health record?\u201d\n\nDr. Bob Wachter is chief of the division of hospital medicine at UC San Francisco Medical Center and author of \u201cThe Digital Doctor.\u201d He was not involved in the research.\n\nHe said the study \u201cis a big deal clinically\u201d and provides \u201creasonably strong evidence\u201d that PPIs can cause harm.\n\nHe also had praise for the methods used \u2014 sifting through doctors\u2019 actual notes from millions of patient encounters. \u201cIt\u2019s a little surprising that this is novel in health care, when you think about Google\u2019s ability to read text or plagiarism detectors. It\u2019s now commonplace to sift through natural language and analyze it in the rest of our lives, but it\u2019s new in medicine.\u201d\n\nSix years ago just 10 percent of doctors and hospitals used electronic health records, he said. Today, that number has shot up to 75 percent, after the federal government\u2019s stimulus package included $30 billion to incentivize providers to adapt electronic health records systems.\n\nWachter said the implementation of health records has \u201cbeen somewhat maligned.\u201d But, \u201cit\u2019s clear that the promise of computerization is real.\u201d\n\nCheck With Your Doctor\n\nYet Dr. Alan Go, director of the Comprehensive Clinical Research Unit at Kaiser\u2019s Division of Research in Oakland, found the association between PPIs and heart attack risk to be \u201cvery weak overall\u201d in the study.\n\n\u201cMore rigorous data are needed before we make a clinical recommendation to stop using these medications,\u201d he said.\n\nHe cautioned that the study did not look at the full range of variables that could affect the result \u2014 what researchers call \u201cconfounders.\u201d For example, behavior and lifestyle of individual patients were not accounted for.\n\nStill, all the doctors interviewed for this article agreed that this news provides a reminder that patients should check with their doctor about whether the need for a PPI is really there.\n\nStudy authors Shah and Leeper say that if this technology \u2014 electronic health records combined with data-combing algorithms \u2014 had been developed sooner, the association between PPIs and heart attack risk would have been identified in the year 2000.\n\n\u201cAnd so we could have started a prospective study back then to figure out the truth,\u201d Leeper said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The drugs include some of the most commonly prescribed medications, such as Prilosec and Nexium.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Stanford 'Big Data' Study Links Common Heartburn Drugs with Heart Attack Risk\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2015\\/06\\/10\\/stanford-big-data-study-links-common-heartburn-drugs-with-heart-attack-risk\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-06-10 14:09:13\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-06-17 14:20:35\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":35574,\"author_id\":\"240\",\"author_name\":\"Lisa Aliferis\",\"author_display_name\":\"Lisa Aliferis\",\"tags\":[\"Science\"],\"categories\":[\"Digital Health\",\"Tests &amp; Treatments\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2015\\/06\\/iStock_000017435404_Large.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "The drugs include some of the most commonly prescribed medications, such as Prilosec and Nexium.", "title": "Stanford \u2018Big Data\u2019 Study Links Common Heartburn Drugs with Heart Attack Risk", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2015/06/10/stanford-big-data-study-links-common-heartburn-drugs-with-heart-attack-risk/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2015/06/iStock_000017435404_Large-1440x1054.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "science", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2c2d\"", "article_summary": "Prilosec is one of several medications in a class of drugs called proton pump inhibitors associated with an increased risk of heart attack.\nThe study did not show increased risk of heart attack in people taking a drug that fights heartburn in a different way, called an H2 blocker.\nStill, the increased risk is \u201cabove baseline\u201d Leeper said.\nThe concern is that when that increased risk is multiplied across the millions of people taking the drug, some of whom are likely to be at higher risk of a heart attack.\n( Getty Images )Some of the most commonly used drugs in the world to treat heartburn are associated with a 16 to 20 percent increased risk of heart attack, a large data mining study of electronic health records from Stanford researchers shows."}
