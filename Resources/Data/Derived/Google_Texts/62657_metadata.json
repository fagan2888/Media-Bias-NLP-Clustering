He estimates the building will be under repair for up to a month.\n\n\u201cThe fire comes at a very bad time of year for the over 900 seniors who receive Meals On Wheels,\u201d Heiman said in a news release. \u201cThe upcoming holiday season and the potential for inclement weather leave the homebound especially vulnerable.\u201d\n\nWhile recipients do have emergency meals to get them by on Sunday and Monday, Senior Services is working on a plan to deliver meals on Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\nA refrigerated storage truck will temporarily house frozen meals, Heiman said. Senior Services is asking for the community\u2019s help finding a place to house the kitchen operations for the next few weeks until the building can be restored.
