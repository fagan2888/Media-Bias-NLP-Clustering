Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash) (Mark Wilson / Getty Images)\n\nAs Democrats fired up the \u201cwar on women\u201d campaign again this week, a top ranking woman in the Republican-majority House tested the GOP message to battle the allegation in the midterm election campaign.\n\n\u201cWe are starting to hear this drumbeat again from the Democrats suggesting that the Republicans are waging a war on women,\u201d Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.) said in a speech Friday afternoon to the Republican National Committee \u201cTaking Back the Future\u201d conference at a Washington, D.C. hotel. \u201cAs you all know, there\u2019s no truth to it.\u201d\n\nMcMorris Rogers, the fourth ranking Republican in the House, said in order to fight the Democratic message, GOP women must emphasize the message of \u201cempowerment\u201d and individual freedom instead of expanding government.\n\n\u201cWe need to make sure everyone in this country understands, the Republican vision is one that is about is about empowering you, the belief that you will make better decisions for yourself\u2026than the federal government ever will,\u201d she said.\n\nMcMorris Rodgers did not mention the latest Democratic salvo about the Supreme Court\u2019s Hobby Lobby case decision specifically, but referred to the \u201cLife of Julia\u201d interactive infographic used by the Obama campaign during the 2012 election.\n\nThe graphic illustrated how a woman can use government policies to help her throughout her life \u2013 a message McMorris Rodgers said amounted to government dependence.\n\n\u201cWhy would smart, independent women, who have worked so hard to achieve new levels and leadership in every field\u2026 want to return to that kind of a government?\u201d McMorris Rodgers asked.\n\nObama defeated former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney by 18 percentage points among women in 2012. Over the past two years, the GOP has launched multiple programs to engage women voters to try to close that gender gap.\n\n\u201cThe war on women stuff is something that worked last cycle,\u201d said Kirsten Kukowski, a spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee. \u201cLast time around there were a lot of false narratives that were created.\u201d\n\nThe latest back and forth about the \u201cwar\u201d was sparked by the Supreme Court\u2019s 5-4 decision in favor of craft supply retailer Hobby Lobby that said privately-held companies do not have to offer their employees contraceptive coverage that conflicts with the owners\u2019 religious beliefs.\n\nSenate Democrats pushed back against the ruling this week by filing a bill aimed at overturning the decision. The \u201cNot My Boss\u2019s Business Act\u201d would require that employers follow the contraception mandate in the Affordable Care Act, regardless of their religious objections.\n\n\u201cContraception has always been between a woman, her partner, her doctor and her faith,\u201d said Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.). \u201cThose five justices decided that a woman\u2019s boss also has a say.\u201d\n\nSeveral Democratic groups also weighed in, placing the blame for the Supreme Court decision squarely with Republicans.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re taking note of every single candidate who applauded the Supreme Court\u2019s disastrous decision to allow bosses to deny female employees birth control coverage,\u201d Dawn Laguens, executive vice president and chief executive officer of Planned Parenthood Action Fund, wrote in a memo. \u201cIn the key races identified below \u2013 and in others -we plan to ensure that women voters know exactly what\u2019s at stake and who would block access to contraceptive care.\u201d\n\nEMILY\u2019s List \u2013 a group that supports female Democratic women who are for abortion rights \u2013 announced the launch of a campaign \u201cto guide Republicans on how to avoid complete failure when reaching out to women voters.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom blocking women\u2019s access to healthcare and birth control to working against equal pay for women to opposing an increase in the minimum wage, Republicans are totally out of step with American women. We\u2019re here to help,\u201d said Jess McIntosh, Communications Director at EMILY\u2019s List.\n\nKukowski dismissed the narrative that Republicans were trying to ban contraception.\n\n\u201cHobby Lobby is still providing contraception, 16 different kinds of contraception,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to be out there talking to voters and being able to fight back against that narrative instead of allowing that narrative to be shaped for us.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The fourth-ranking House Republican shot back at the Democrats a speech to GOP women on Friday.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The fourth-ranking House Republican shot back at the Democrats a speech to GOP women on Friday.", "title": "McMorris Rodgers tests GOP response to \u2018war on women\u2019 charge", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/she-the-people/wp/2014/07/11/mcmorris-rodgers-tests-gop-response-to-war-on-women-charge/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/she-the-people/files/2014/01/rodgers-300x188.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@JFKucinich"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/she-the-people/wp/2014/07/11/mcmorris-rodgers-tests-gop-response-to-war-on-women-charge/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "war on women, republicans women's issues, cathy mcmorris rodgers", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "war on women, republicans women's issues, cathy mcmorris rodgers"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd092e\"", "article_summary": "The graphic illustrated how a woman can use government policies to help her throughout her life \u2013 a message McMorris Rodgers said amounted to government dependence.\n\u201cWhy would smart, independent women, who have worked so hard to achieve new levels and leadership in every field\u2026 want to return to that kind of a government?\u201d McMorris Rodgers asked.\n\u201cThe war on women stuff is something that worked last cycle,\u201d said Kirsten Kukowski, a spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee.\nFile: Rep.
