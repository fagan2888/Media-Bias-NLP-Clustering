Ted Cruz would like to clear up something about those bad-boy posters in L.A.\n\nposted at 9:21 pm on March 17, 2014 by Mary Katharine Ham\n\nOver the weekend, some truly great L.A. street art went viral. The posters feature Sen. Ted Cruz\u2019s head atop a shirtless torso tattooed within an inch of its armpits, hawking the \u201cBlacklisted and Loving It Tour,\u201d with a cigarette hanging from his lip. Cruz was indeed appearing in L.A. the week the posters promoted, though at the Beverly Wilshire, not the Hilton.\n\nThe speed with which the poster\u2019s image sailed through political circles, left and right, illustrates the power of a little unexpected art, particularly good street art, which is not exactly known as a conservative strong suit. Cruz\u2019s response illustrates the immense power of a little unexpected art in the reply as well. His genuinely funny (not just graded on the Senator Curve) response spurred a whole other round of coverage.\n\nSaw this, but noticed an error.

This is evidenced of course by the Cruz posters, but also by some of the other far more over the edge pieces posted on the Facebook site. We have asked him about his artwork and in particular about his motivations with the Cruz posters, but have not heard back at this time. Until then, you\u2019ll be happy to know that, friend or foe, the Cruz posters will soon be available to all.\n\nMeanwhile, the poster has inspired other Photoshops:\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Smokin\u2019.", "title": "Sen.
