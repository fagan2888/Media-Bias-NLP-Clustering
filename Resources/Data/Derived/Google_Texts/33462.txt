Rain will continue in off and on fashion for Central and eastern Kansas through the evening and overnight and snow will continue to spread across parts of western Kansas through the night as well.

This area of snow will then slowly track eastward while diminishing into central Kansas after midnight. Some significant accumulations will be possible across the west where Winter Weather Advisories and Winter Storm Warnings have been posted.

We could see some hazardous travel conditions across the west with heavy snow and gusty north winds through the night. 3” to 7”+ of accumulation will be possible around 50 miles either side of a line from near Liberal to Dodge City and up to Hays with some localized higher amounts. Snowfall amounts will tapper off to the East.

While a mix of rain and light snow will be a slight possibility in Wichita late Sunday night, accumulation will be slim to none. Major travel issues are not anticipated in Wichita.

Snow will exit KAKEland late Sunday night into the early Monday morning with temperatures warming back in the 40s and 50s Monday afternoon.
