He served time in a federal prison and was under house arrest. After finishing his sentence, Creamer worked for Obama\u2019s presidential campaign, training organizers.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nAs Breitbart News first exposed in 2009, Creamer used his prison time to work on a political manual: Listen to Your Mother: Stand Up Straight! How Progressives Can Win. In it, he devised a strategy to guide a future \u201cprogressive\u201d president. His plan included implementing \u201cuniversal health care\u201d as a first step to other radical reforms, including amnesty for illegal aliens. Obama strategist David Axelrod called the book \u201ca blueprint for future victories.\u201d\n\nIn the book, Creamer also warns against an effort by \u201cNeocons\u201d to launch a military strike on Iran to prevent it from developing nuclear weapons. Creamer also blames America for the rise of the Iranian regime: \u201cThe United States helped set the stage for the fundamentalist resurgence of Islam in Iran,\u201d he argues, by overthrowing the Iranian government in 1953 and backing the Shah. (These same views are widely shared in the Obama administration.)\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reports that Creamer advocated for the Iran deal with the help of the Ploughshares Fund, a pro-Iran organization.\n\nAccording to a transcript of the [Ploughshares] call reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, participants stressed that the Iran agreement was the most important of the Obama administration\u2019s second term, and they needed to prepare for battle with Republicans. \u201cThe other side will go crazy. We have to be really clear that it\u2019s a good deal,\u201d said Robert Creamer of Americans United for Change, a liberal action group. His wife is Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D., Ill.), a close ally of the White House in selling the agreement. Ploughshares officials defended the group as nonpartisan. \u201cPloughshares Fund is proud of the work of our grantees and partners in support of this historic nuclear agreement,\u201d said Joe Cirincione, its president. \u201cWe support this agreement, not any particular party or administration.\u201d Mr. Creamer, a longtime Democratic activist, said Friday he supported the Iran deal because it was better than an any alternative, and it ensured the U.S. wouldn\u2019t get bogged down in another Middle East war, like in Iraq.\n\nThe Journal does not report Creamer\u2019s felony convictions, nor his past work with the Obama campaign.\n\nIt does note, however: \u201c[Creamer\u2019s] wife is Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D., Ill.), a close ally of the White House in selling the agreement.\u201d (The author of this article challenged Schakowsky for Congress in 2010.)", "article_metadata": {"description": "Convicted fraudster Robert Creamer played a key role in selling the Iran deal to Democrats, according to the Wall Street Journal.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Convicted fraudster Robert Creamer played a key role in selling the Iran deal to Democrats, according to the Wall Street Journal.", "title": "Convicted Fraudster Helped Obama Sell Iran Deal - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-08-at-4.52.12-AM.png", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2015-09-13T05:25:25-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/09/12/convicted-fraudster-helped-obama-sell-iran-deal/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Convicted fraudster Robert Creamer played a key role in selling the Iran deal to Democrats, according to the Wall Street Journal.", "creator": "@joelpollak", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-08-at-4.52.12-AM.png", "title": "Convicted Fraudster Helped Obama Sell Iran Deal - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "convicted felon, iran deal, Jan Schakowsky, nuclear Iran, ploughshares fund, robert creamer,Big Government, Breitbart Jerusalem, National Security,Iran Deal", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-09-12T22:31:01-07:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/joelpollak", "section": "Big Government", "modified_time": "2015-09-13T05:25:25-07:00", "tag": "robert creamer", "categories": "Big Government,National Security,Breitbart Jerusalem"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaa38\"", "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERConvicted fraudster Robert Creamer played a key role in selling the Iran deal to Democrats, according to a report by the Wall Street Journal.\nThe Wall Street Journal reports that Creamer advocated for the Iran deal with the help of the Ploughshares Fund, a pro-Iran organization.\nThe Journal does not report Creamer\u2019s felony convictions, nor his past work with the Obama campaign.\nHis wife is Rep.
