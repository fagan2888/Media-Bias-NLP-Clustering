Hopefully, Washington and myself can come to an agreement.\u201d\n\nGeneral manager Brian MacLellan, appointed to the post in May when the contract of George McPhee wasn\u2019t renewed, made no promises that Green would last in Washington. When asked if he could see Green remaining with the team past the upcoming season, MacLellan said he \u201cwould assume so,\u201d because Green\u2019s \u201ca good player. He\u2019s one of the best defensemen in the league when he\u2019s playing well.\u201d\n\nYet MacLellan also said that the team had not yet begun contract talks with Green\u2019s representatives, preferring to take a wait-and-see approach.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty here,\u201d MacLellan said. \u201cI think we need to get into the season and see how our D pans out and what the pairs are like and how it looks. I think we need to play some games.\u201d\n\nNew coach Barry Trotz was known for his defense-centric system during the better part of his 15 years coaching in Nashville, but the argument can be made that Trotz\u2019s teams lacked the marquee offensive players that he\u2019ll have in Washington.\n\nHe has said that he hopes his forwards play better defensively, and his defensemen play better offensively, but putting Green back in position to score more than 30 goals \u2014 or at least match his 2009-10 season, when he scored 19 \u2014 seems unlikely.\n\nAt the very least, Trotz wants Green to be able to move the puck as well as he did earlier in his career. And, Green believes, that can happen as long as he has consistency; most frequently paired with Dmitry Orlov last season, he also shared the ice at times with Karl Alzner and Jack Hillen.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important to sort of have chemistry with your partner, and it was very tough to sort of develop that when you have a new partner every night,\u201d Green said. \u201cIt was definitely a bit of a kerfuffle throughout the whole season.\u201d\n\nWhile Trotz has loosely penciled in his lineups for each of the Capitals\u2018 eight preseason games \u2014 the first of which was a 1-0 win over Buffalo on Sunday \u2014 he won\u2019t begin to develop his initial defensive pairings for at least a week.\n\nWhat\u2019s certain, though, is that Green will have a role. After initially meeting Trotz last offseason, Green is encouraged by his new coach\u2019s structure and system; Trotz, likewise, appreciates Green\u2019s experience enough to select the defenseman to his leadership group, a council of several players who will help link the locker room with the coaching staff.\n\n\u201cThis is a business, and you never know what\u2019s going to happen, but I\u2019m very excited to still be a part of this organization,\u201d Green said. \u201cMy heart\u2019s here and it has always been here.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "General manager Brian MacLellan, appointed to the post in May when the contract of George McPhee wasn't renewed, made no promises that Green would last in Washington.
