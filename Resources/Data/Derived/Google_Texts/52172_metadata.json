On March 3 a year ago, the stock closed at $77.12, compared to shares closing at $144.13 on March 16 this year.\u201cPalo Alto [Networks] should remain a core holding in large cap software. Maintaining Outperform and raising price target to $165 as the stock looks attractive on a FCF multiple,\u201d wrote Matthew Hedberg, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets LLC in a new note published on March 3.\u201cGiven the increasing rate and severity of today\u2019s highly sophisticated cyber attacks, enterprises worldwide are turning to us to help them solve their most complex security challenges,\u201d said Mark McLaughlin, the company\u2019s president and chief executive officer, during the earnings call. \u201cWe have been displacing Checkpoint for a long time. We are becoming the industry standard and \u2026 there is no reason to believe that will change anytime in the future.\u201d\u201cThere is growing attention [to cyber threats] and we are seeing good spending [to deal with these threats],\u201d said McLaughlin, responding to a question from Dan Ives of FBR Capital Markets about the current cybersecurity market. \u201cThe government is also recognizing the need to be at the forefront of cybersecurity. The fiscal \u201915 budget was a tough one but I would expect fiscal \u201916 to have more money, which bodes well for [cybersecurity] providers like us.\u201dHowever, investors seemed to be hoping for more as shares of Palo Alto Networks, which rose 2.6 percent during the regular trading session Monday, slipped 1.4 percent to $145 in early after-hours trading and continued dropping, closing at $144.13 on the New York Stock Exchange on March 16.
