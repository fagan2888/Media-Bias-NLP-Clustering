The result was a 6-3 loss, and a 1-2 record entering its first road trip of the season.\n\nTHE RUNDOWN: This game, much like the season-opener, turned on an Ian Desmond error, his third in three games. Desmond bobbled a grounder with one out in the third that could have started an inning-ending double play. Instead, Strasburg hit the next batter with a pitch and gave up consecutive singles. A total of four runs scored in the inning, three of which were unearned. It\u2019s hard to lay all the blame at Desmond\u2019s feet because Strasburg could have responded better than he did. But then again, he might not have been in that position at all if Desmond had been able to complete the play.\n\nSEE ALSO: Bryce Harper already making an impact in right field\n\nTHE HIGHLIGHT: Slim pickens here today, so let\u2019s go with Washington\u2019s only real offensive highlight of the afternoon: a Michael Taylor double in the seventh. The 24-year-old worked an eight-pitch at-bat against Mets reliever Buddy Carlyle with two outs, then crushed the ninth pitch off the center-field wall, bringing two runs in to score. Taylor and Bryce Harper are now tied for the lead with four hits apiece through three games.\n\nSTAR OF THE GAME: He doesn\u2019t play for the Nationals, but it\u2019s hard to pick anyone besides Harvey. What a performance. In his first major-league start since August 24, 2013, the right-hander gave up just four hits in six innings and recorded nine strikeouts. Harper, who had been Washington\u2019s hottest hitter, was on the wrong end of three of them. All three ended with a waist-high fastball at 96 or 97 mph.\n\nSEE ALSO: In high-leverage situation, Blake Treinen continues to impress\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY: The Nationals can\u2019t wait to get Jayson Werth back in this lineup. In the first two games of the season, the bottom half of the order was a nonfactor. Then on Thursday, Washington\u2019s 3-4-5 hitters went a combined 0-for-12. Yes, New York\u2019s starting pitchers made things difficult throughout the series. Harvey and Jacob deGrom are nasty, and Bartolo Colon is no slouch, either. But the Nationals need to pick it up at the plate, and adding Werth back to the middle of the order will work wonders in that department.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Harvey was dominant in his first major-league start Tommy John surgery, and Stephen Strasburg couldn't recover from another Ian Desmond error as Washington lost, 6-3.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Harvey was dominant in his first major-league start Tommy John surgery, and Stephen Strasburg couldn\u2019t recover from another Ian Desmond error as Washington lost, 6-3.", "title": "The Rundown: Matt Harvey outduels Stephen Strasburg as Nationals lose, 6-3", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/9/rundown-matt-harvey-outduels-stephen-strasburg-nat/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/09/Mets_Nationals_Baseball.JPEG-051d7.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/09/Mets_Nationals_Baseball.JPEG-051d7.jpg", "description": "Harvey was dominant in his first major-league start Tommy John surgery, and Stephen Strasburg couldn't recover from another Ian Desmond error as Washington lost, 6-3.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "The Rundown: Matt Harvey outduels Stephen Strasburg as Nationals lose,"}, "Author": "Tom Schad", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Matt Harvey, Stephen Strasburg, Washington"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd99a9\"", "article_summary": "The ballyhooed matchup between Stephen Strasburg and Matt Harvey didn\u2019t quite live up to the hype.\nHarvey was predictably dominant in his first big-league start since Tommy John surgery, but Strasburg gave up six runs in 5 1/3 innings and the Washington Nationals lineup didn\u2019t give him much help.\nTHE RUNDOWN: This game, much like the season-opener, turned on an Ian Desmond error, his third in three games.\nSTAR OF THE GAME: He doesn\u2019t play for the Nationals, but it\u2019s hard to pick anyone besides Harvey.\nThe result was a 6-3 loss, and a 1-2 record entering its first road trip of the season."}
