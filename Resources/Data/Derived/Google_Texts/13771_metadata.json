In the 2012 survey of employers, 51% said the same thing.\n\nAt the same time, 40.4% said demand was less than or much less than available supply in 2013, a large jump over 29.4% in 2012.\n\nThe number of nursing grads hired in 2013 \u2014 76% \u2014 was less than the previous three years with the highest number reported in 2010 \u2014 84.6%.\n\nDuring a webinar last week \u2014 \u201cEconomic Recovery and the Nursing Labor Market in California\u201d \u2014 nursing experts and stakeholders:\n\nExamined the state of supply and demand of nurses in California through the perspectives of new graduates and nurse employers;\n\nStudied forecasts of future supply and demand and the latest hospital vacancy and turnover data; and\n\nIdentified next steps for ensuring an adequate supply of nurses.\n\nSponsored by UC-San Francisco, the Hospital Association of Southern California, the Betty Irene Moore Nursing Initiative and the California Institute for Nursing & Health Care, the webinar suggested that demand for newly graduated nurses has weakened across the state, while at the same time it has become increasingly difficult to fill positions for more experienced nurses, such as case managers, clinical educators and department managers.\n\nJoanne Spetz, professor at the Institute for Health Policy Studies at UC-San Francisco, said hospitals generally reported difficulty in finding experienced nurses. While demand for more nurses might be rising, there is still a mismatch between the number of new graduates and open positions.\n\nJudee Berg, executive director of the California Institute for Nursing & Health Care, said the state\u2019s economic climate has played a role in the nursing marketplace. \u201cThe recession is the primary cause of disappearing vacancies,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cSome nurses delayed retirement, while others moved from part-time to full-time jobs or kept their part-time jobs and took a second job in a community setting. We are still seeing a residual effect,\u201d Berg said.\n\nProspects for the future are looking up, nursing experts say. Expectations for hiring more new graduates during the period of 2012-2013 grew slightly over the prior year, from 21.6% to 22.3%, and continued to increase into 2013-2014, reaching 24.1%, according to the UCSF survey.\n\nIn 2013-2014, hospitals anticipating hiring fewer nurses dropped from 22.3% during the prior year to 14.8%.\n\nReasons for expecting to hire more nurses included an increase in the census, patient acuity and bed capacity, along with care model redesign. A reduction in census, budget constraints, hiring freezes and less staff turnover were reasons hospitals gave for less hiring.\n\n\u201cBaby boomer nurses are not retiring as early as expected because they like their jobs or need to continue to work to compensate for losses in retirement portfolios during the recession,\u201d Spetz said. \u201cThey have a reputation for being more career-oriented and attached to their jobs.\u201d\n\nAre New Nurse Graduates Lacking Experience?\n\nHospitals also are becoming pickier about whom they hire. The proportion of California hospitals requiring new hires to have a bachelor\u2019s degree rose from 4.6% in 2011 to 8.2% in 2013, according to the UCSF survey. More than half of employers require a Bachelor of Science in Nursing for positions beyond staff nurse. Slightly more than 11% require that newly hired RNs obtain a BSN within a specified time period. About two-thirds of hospitals surveyed \u2014 66% \u2014 reported they intend to increase the number of hires with a BSN.\n\nLess than one-third of new hires were recent nurse graduates, whether full- or part-time, according to the Hospital Association of Southern California\u2019s quarterly Healthcare Workforce Survey.\n\nThe survey focuses on turnover and vacancy trends in the California hospital industry, providing information to hospitals to help them make hiring decisions, said Teri Hollingsworth, vice president of human resources for HASC.\n\nShe emphasized the value of the collaboration of the organizations sponsoring the webinar, along with others groups, that are coordinating data collection to streamline the process, something that was unheard of years ago.\n\n\u201cPreviously, there were four or five surveys collecting the same data but not sharing them,\u201d she said last week. \u201cOur collaboration is working well and offering quick results; other states are impressed at our robust database and are asking how to replicate it.\u201d\n\nExperience, Geography Affect Nursing Workforce\n\nCINHC\u2019s \u201c2012-2013 California New Graduate Hiring Survey\u201d addresses how new nursing graduates are faring based on their experience and where they live.\n\nThe survey of newly licensed nurses in California reported:\n\n46.6% found jobs within three months (compared with 53% in 2012);\n\n61.6% found their \u201cjobs of choice\u201d (compared with 65% in 2012); and\n\n77.2% were working full time.\n\nFor those not employed, 92% cited lack of experience as the primary barrier, while 46.5% said a shortage of available positions as a factor.\n\nCalifornia hospitals hired fewer nurses with associate degrees in 2013 (55%) than those with a BSN (63%) and with an entry-level master\u2019s degree (67%).\n\nMore than half the state\u2019s hospitals \u2014 55% \u2014 developed nursing residency programs in 2013, according to the survey of nurse employers.\n\n\u201cWhen new graduates finish their education and look for a new job, they need clinical guidance \u2014 a residency much like the one for physicians that takes time and mentoring,\u201d Berg said. \u201cSome hospitals offer specialist programs to onboard nurses and provide supervision but not all hospitals can do it,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cBut even when they do, they are not always able to incorporate the new nurses into staffing. Many employers believe residencies are worthwhile, but others don\u2019t consider them important enough as a way to reduce turnover.\u201d\n\nThe San Francisco Bay Area experienced the smallest demand for registered nurses last year with only 41.6% of new graduates employed as an RN compared with 80% in the San Joaquin Valley, according to CINHC.\n\n\u201cThe Bay Area is the most challenging because there are more nursing schools per capita, making it less likely for new graduates in this area to find a job than in other regions,\u201d Spetz said. \u201cThis is consistent with employer perceptions of a surplus of nurses in the Bay Area.\u201d\n\n\u201cReasons for the differences in regions across the state are not clear, and we would need to study this further to determine what those factors are,\u201d Berg said. \u201cIt may be related to locations of schools of nursing; numbers of new graduate RNs, hospital beds and other employment opportunities in each region; stability of the existing nursing workforce; and multiple other factors.\n\n\u201cWe do know, however, that the Bay Area has consistently been the part of the state where new graduate RNs have experienced the most difficulty in finding their first jobs,\u201d Berg said.\n\nAffordable Care Act\u2019s Potential To Affect Nurse Workforce\n\nWith the effects of the Affordable Care Act playing out in communities across the state, Spetz worked with Bianca Frogner, assistant professor at George Washington University, and Steve Parente, managing principal for Health Systems Innovation Network to develop a microsimulation to forecast new job openings for nurses through 2021. The methodology is based on an existing model used to predict insurance coverage demand.\n\nBy 2021, California could expect to add 10,000 jobs for RNs because of the ACA and an additional 45,000 positions regardless of the law, the majority (62.1%) in hospitals. Spetz said the forecast is affected by a mix of settings, such as medical homes and home-based health services; health information technology; bundled payments; and accountable care organizations.\n\nThe next steps for ensuring adequate supply, Spetz said, depend on how the state defines \u201cshortage,\u201d whether current levels of demand are based on economic or need factors and if California\u2019s nursing ratio should align with the national average or if it should remain in the 25th percentile in terms of supply.\n\nThe national average in 2013 was 746 RNs per 100,000 individuals, while the 25th percentile nationwide was 706 RNs per 100,000, according to the California Board of Registered Nursing. For more than 10 years, California has had one of the lowest ratios, ranking 48th among states in 2008.\n\nThe number of new nursing school graduates in California has more than doubled in the past decade, adding more than 11,000 nurses a year, according to the California Board of Registered Nursing. Spetz said that is the number projected to be optimal for maintaining enough supply, providing an opportunity to balance supply and demand in the long term.\n\n\u201cWe need to identify strategies to retain new graduates\u2019 skills and employ them quickly, promote continued education for RNs who want it and prepare new graduates to work in non-hospital settings,\u201d Spetz said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "<p>Four years ago, there was a shortage of nurses in California hospitals but by 2013, the landscape had flipped.
