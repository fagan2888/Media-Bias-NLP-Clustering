Galarraga, 53, was born in Caracas, Venezuela, on June 18, 1961.\n\n\u201cThis is special, against the Rockies, and in Miami,\u201d said Galarraga, who wore a purple-striped shirt for the occasion.\n\nThe Big Cat, of course, was the Rockies\u2019 first big star. Under the tutelage of manager Don Baylor, he resurrected his career in 1993, hitting .370 to win the National League batting title in the Rockies\u2019 first year of existence. The nimble first baseman was a three-time all-star with the Rockies.\n\nGalarraga hit 399 career homers for seven different teams in his long career, but being in Miami, the subject of his most famous home run came up Saturday. It was a towering grand-slam off the Marlins\u2019 Kevin Brown on May 31, 1997 into the upper deck at Pro Player Stadium. It was originally called one of the longest homers ever hit, traveling 579 feet. The homer was later reduced to a more modest 529 feet.\n\n\u201cThey said it was the longest ever when I hit it,\u201d Galarraga said. \u201cAt the time I hit it, I was so excited. I hit it off Kevin Brown and everything. The bases were loaded, it was here in Miami with a lot of people from Venezuela. I was so happy. Then they cut it back \u2026 I don\u2019t know what happened there.\u201d\n\nThe actual distance of Galarraga\u2019s homer, considered the longest ever hit by a Rockies player, has been the subject of debate since 1997. In 2011, ESPN\u2019s Home Run Tracker tested the distance of the Big Cat\u2019s legendary blow.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Andres Galarraga,Kevin Brown,Walt Weiss", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "On the Rox", "description": "There were smiles all around Saturday afternoon at Marlins Park.
