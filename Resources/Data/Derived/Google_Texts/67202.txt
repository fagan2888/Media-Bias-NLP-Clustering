Hewlett-Packard Co. said Autonomy Corp. improperly reported $709 million in revenue over 2½ years before H-P bought the British software maker for $11 billion in 2011, as it fleshed out fraud allegations against former Autonomy executives.

H-P sued Autonomy’s former Chief Executive Michael Lynch and former Chief Financial Officer Sushovan Hussain on March 30, seeking approximately $5.1 billion in damages.

In Tuesday’s court filing, H-P HPQ, +6.89% said Autonomy sought to boost revenue — and ultimately its market valuation — through improper practices: reselling computers made by other companies at a loss, engaging in suspicious software-licensing deals with partners, and restructuring data-hosting deals so that they generated more revenue upfront.

Autonomy reported nearly $2.1 billion in revenue from 2009 through the first half of 2011, the period over which H-P said it improperly booked more than $700 million. The biggest chunk, roughly $318 million, included deals where Autonomy sold its products through resellers or hosted other companies’ data on its computers.

In the filing, H-P said Lynch gave the go-ahead to start selling “pure hardware at a loss,” in late 2009, pushing sales executives to boost their numbers. H-P said Lynch offered one executive, Michael Sullivan, a Porsche if he could resell $10 million worth of hardware that quarter. The filing doesn’t say whether Sullivan got the car.

The allegations shed new light into H-P’s long-running dispute with Lynch, whom H-P fired in 2012, just seven months after buying his company.
