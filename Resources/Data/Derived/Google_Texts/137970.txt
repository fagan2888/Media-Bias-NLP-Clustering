Hillary Clinton has staked out the same position on the Dodd-Frank Act, which regulates financial institutions, as 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney. A new video from America Rising contrasts Clinton’s Tuesday comments with comments by Romney.

Addressing a crowd in Iowa on Tuesday, Clinton said small businesses have a hard time securing loans because local banks are “being squeezed by regulations that don’t make sense for their size and mission, like endless examinations and paperwork designed for banks that measure their assets in the many billions.”

The Dodd-Frank Act, which passed in 2010 with overwhelming Democratic support, imposed some of the regulations targeted by Clinton in her address.

Romney made a similar point in a Republican presidential debate four years earlier.

“Small community banks across this country are starving and struggling because of inspectors that are making their jobs impossible and because of regulation,” Romney said. Before entering politics, Romney founded the private equity firm Bain Capital.

Dodd-Frank is unpopular among Republicans, who have dubbed it “Obamacare for banks,” but it is still popular among liberals. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.), who supports the bill, has said it does not go far enough to break up big banks.

Clinton has been criticized by some liberals who say she is too cozy with big banks and Wall Street.
