On Oct. 7, HBO and Living Language will release \u201cLiving Language Dothraki: A Conversational Language Course\u201d by linguist and language creator David Peterson. Peterson, a co-founder of the Language Creation Society, joined forces with HBO in 2009 to create the language spoken by the nomadic warriors seen in Seasons 1 and 2. He later invented Low and High Valryian.\n\nThough Peterson has coined 3,800 words in Dothraki and plans to make around 10,000, the course, which serves as a primer to Dothraki culture, teaches readers around 500 words and idiomatic phrases. For those who want to gain a conversational command of the language, there\u2019s also an online component.\n\nBut \u201cLiving Language Dothraki\u201d is not just for the Dwight Schrutes of the world. Peterson, who has also helped create languages for Syfy\u2019s \u201cDefiance\u201d and \u201cDominion\u201d and CW\u2019s \u201cStar-Crossed,\u201d has observed that many casual viewers are interested in the fictional languages borne from George R.R. Martin\u2019s book \u201cA Song of Ice and Fire\u201d (judging by the response to the show\u2019s \u201cMonty Python\u201d Easter Egg this season, Peterson\u2019s assessment seems spot on).\n\nWhere do you start when it comes to creating a language?\n\nWith Dothraki, that was the first time that I was starting with found material. So in the books that had been published up to that point \u2014 there were four of them in \u201cA Song of Ice and Fire\u201d \u2014 there were about 50 words in Dothraki and about half of those were names. For Dothraki, the first step was cataloging all of those words and seeing how they were spelled and determining how I thought they would be pronounced, both by trying to determine how I thought George R.R. Martin meant for them to be pronounced, and how I thought he was thinking fans would think they would be pronounced, or would plausibly be pronounced, since it was a foreign language.\n\nSo I started there, and then, based on that, I analyzed the sound system, both what sounds I felt were represented in those words and how they fit together in the syllables and words. Once I\u2019d done that I filled in any gaps that I saw in the system. I added one sound to Dothraki, which was a \u201cch\u201d sound, which I thought should be there.\n\nI think the longest phrase was, \u201ca prince rides inside me\u201d \u2014 \u201cKhalakka dothrae mr\u2019anha,\u201d which, based on a few phrases like that and \u201cstrong boy\u201d (\u201crakh haj\u201d), I determined the word order of the language: the subject was first and then the verb and the object, adjectives would follow the nouns that they modified.\n\nWhy did you even need to create a full language for a fictional universe?\n\nWell, the driving force for all of this, and of course the reason I\u2019m even on the project, is Dan Weiss and David Benioff. More than any other show I\u2019ve worked on, they absolutely set the tone for what\u2019s expected of everybody that\u2019s working on it and the vision that they want to achieve. And really what they want to do, visually and style-wise, is two things: They want to have a show that\u2019s as realistic as possible given the fantasy setting, and they want to, as much as they possibly can, realize George R.R. Martin\u2019s vision. So those two things combined really necessitates a full language, and that was in fact why they hired me in the first place.\n\nThey started filling in gibberish for Dothraki and they realized it just wasn\u2019t meeting their realism goals and it wasn\u2019t honoring George R.R. Martin\u2019s vision.\n\nIn a show, everything that\u2019s happening on the screen has to be explicitly reified, whether it\u2019s the actors in the background, the sets, the costumes. Everything that shows up on the screen or can be heard from the actors on the screen adds a conscious decision on the part of the filmmakers. And so that\u2019s why they realized that it wouldn\u2019t just pass to throw up whatever for the Dothraki, whether it was just being spoken in the background or whether it was being spoken in the forefront. You can\u2019t have a narrator just jump in and say, \u201cAnd then he said this in Dothraki.\u201d They need to actually be saying it.\n\nHave you received any direct feedback from George R.R. Martin about the languages that you created?\n\nNo real direct feedback except that he likes the languages and appreciates that they exist. I think he\u2019s used them. For example, there was a map book that came out called \u201cThe Lands of Ice and Fire\u201d that he did where he fleshed out a lot of maps of his world. And he used some Dothraki to create new place names of the maps.\n\nNot only that, he got my help to translate some of the words. He also did some translations of his own and did them accurately and very well. So I think he likes the languages and he appreciates that they exist because I think he gets the sense that I created them to help flesh out his world, to make it larger and more realistic.\n\nI assume the people teaching themselves Dothraki are going to be some real \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d superfans.\n\nActually, I don\u2019t think so. There are a certain group of fans that are really, really excited about the language and they always follow the new dialogue that comes up and record it and try to learn from it. There are a lot of fans who, especially if it\u2019s online, they think the language sounds really cool and they would like to look it up but they don\u2019t necessarily have the time to go look it up online. Now with the \u201cLiving Languages Course\u201d \u2026 you can buy the book and own it. And also if you just wanted to do something quick and convenient you can download the app to your iPhone and there\u2019s going to be a bunch of flashcards you can just flip through and use casually, which is pretty cool.\n\nAnd then I think for the fans who want to go deeper, that\u2019s what the online course is for. There\u2019s going to be a whole lot more information that is going to be a bit more taxing and require more investment of personal time.\n\nI think we\u2019ve reached a point where you can now find a market for this. And that\u2019s something that we couldn\u2019t even have said five years ago, let alone 20 years ago.\n\nSo will taking this Dothraki course make you fluent?\n\nIt will take you to the point where you will be able to put together a variety of simpler phrases. Like you should be able to string together dialogue and you should be able to understand dialogue. There are going to be nuances of the grammar that are more for intermediate and advanced, but this will get you through the bulk of standard texts, I think. And if you wanted to go back to Seasons 1 and 2, it should give you a foothold into a lot of the dialogue that\u2019s in the show.\n\nIs 10,000 words still the goal?\n\nIt definitely is. The problem is I\u2019ve gotten so busy with so many languages now that I can\u2019t spend as much time with an individual language just to coin new words, which, by the way, is one of my favorite things to do. I don\u2019t know how people imagine the life of a language creator, but for me one of the ultimate joys is to sit down and imagine new words.\n\nIs there a particular world in English that you wish you could create?\n\nEvery single language has words in it that don\u2019t exist in another language, or at least you won\u2019t have a single word for \u2014 like in Spanish there are two different words for corner \u2014 \u201crinc\u00f3n\u201d and \u201cesquina\u201d \u2014 that differ whether the corner is an inside corner or an outside corner. It would be kind of like if you\u2019re looking at the corner of a box from inside the box or outside the box. So it\u2019s like, you can explain that in English. Those specific words don\u2019t exist in English. At least, not concretely. So there are words like that in every language.\n\nOne of the things I found that was most difficult is that when I\u2019m creating a language, I often come up with a lot of those words where it\u2019s like, \u201cOh, that\u2019s a really cool word and there is no word precisely like it in English or any other language I know.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "David Peterson talks about GRRM, his favorite fictional realms, and why so many people want to learn Dothraki", "title": "\u201cYou have to create the language of the misogynist\u201d: Meet the man who invented Dothraki for \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "David Peterson talks about GRRM, his favorite fictional realms, and why so many people want to learn Dothraki", "title": "\u201cYou have to create the language of the misogynist\u201d: Meet the man who invented Dothraki for \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/15/you_have_to_create_the_language_of_the_misogynist_meet_the_man_who_invented_dothraki_for_game_of_thrones/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/david_peterson.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "David Peterson talks about GRRM, his favorite fictional realms, and why so many people want to learn Dothraki", "title": "\u201cYou have to create the language of the misogynist\u201d: Meet the man who invented Dothraki for \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/david_peterson.jpg", "creator": "@prachigu", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Prachi Gupta", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, david peterson, dothraki, Game of Thrones, HBO", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "On Oct. 7, HBO and Living Language will release \u201cLiving Language Dothraki: A Conversational Language Course\u201d by linguist and language creator David Peterson.\nTopics: david peterson, dothraki, Game of Thrones, HBO, Entertainment NewsHere\u2019s one way to stave off withdrawal from HBO\u2019s hit show \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d after Season 4 wraps up tonight: learn Dothraki.\nBut \u201cLiving Language Dothraki\u201d is not just for the Dwight Schrutes of the world.\nNow with the \u201cLiving Languages Course\u201d \u2026 you can buy the book and own it.\nSo will taking this Dothraki course make you fluent?"}
