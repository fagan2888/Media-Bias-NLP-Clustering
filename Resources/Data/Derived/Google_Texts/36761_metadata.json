Officers surrounded the building and began negotiating with Marett through a window and on the phone.\n\nAfter four hours of communication, Marett still refused to come out.\n\nBattering rams were brought out around 10:30 p.m. and were soon followed by a barrage of of tear gas so thick people in the parking lot reportedly were affected.\n\nMarett eventually came out of the apartment onto a balcony where he was taken into custody and booked into the Shawnee County Department of Corrections for the felony warrant.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The suspect was taken into custody using tear gas and battering rams.", "language": "english", "author": "WIBW", "og": {"url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Wanted-felon-taken-into-custody-after-near-4-hour-standoff-in-Topeka-266894631.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/BsTkimdCMAIi-Lg1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The suspect was taken into custody using tear gas and battering rams.", "title": "Wanted felon taken into custody after nearly 4 hour standoff in Topeka"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "The suspect was taken into custody using tear gas and battering rams.", "title": "Wanted felon taken into custody after nearly 4 hour standoff in Topeka", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Wanted-felon-taken-into-custody-after-near-4-hour-standoff-in-Topeka-266894631.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/jesse_marett.jpg", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "keywords": "Wanted felon taken into custody after nearly 4 hour standoff in Topeka", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Wanted felon taken into custody, after nearly 4 hour standoff"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaadd\"", "article_summary": "A south Topeka standoff ends after more than four hours - but not until officers broke out tear gas and battering rams.\nSWAT arrived soon thereafter.\nOfficers arrested 25-year-old Jesse Marett after the gas drove him from his home shortly before 11:00 p.m. on Friday.\nThey discovered Marett was inside, and after attempting to make contact, Marett barricaded the door and refused to come out.\nAfter four hours of communication, Marett still refused to come out."}
