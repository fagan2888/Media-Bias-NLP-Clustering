So did a lot of guys,\u201d Avs coach Patrick Roy said. \u201cWe mention many times how excited we are about the depth, and here it is. It\u2019s nice to see.\u201d\n\nBased on contracts, Hishon, Rendulic and Everberg will probably begin the season in the American Hockey League, playing for the San Antonio Rampage. If they stick together, they\u2019ll undoubtedly make up San Antonio\u2019s top line.\n\n\u201cNo matter where any of us end up, either here or down in San Antonio, they\u2019re going to be great teams in both cities,\u201d said Hishon, the Avs\u2019 2010 first-round draft pick who has battled injuries and a lack of size in becoming an NHL regular. \u201cThis is the most competitive camp I\u2019ve been to. We\u2019ve got a lot of depth at every position. It\u2019s definitely very exciting moving forward. The future is very bright.\u201d\n\nPHOTOS: Colorado Avalanche burgundy and white scrimmage at DU\n\nColorado\u2019s depth is indeed impressive, unlike how it was stocked via the draft in the previous five years.\n\nThe team scoured the European leagues to sign Everberg from Sweden and Rendulic from Croatia before last season, and Norwegian Andreas Martinsen, 25, in May. Martinsen, 6-foot-3 and 220 pounds, played with center Matt Duchene and right wing Jarome Iginla on Sunday. But like Everberg and Rendulic, Martinsen will require some North American seasoning and probably end up in San Antonio.\n\nEverberg and Rendulic were pushed along last season. Because of injuries and a lack of depth, Rendulic played 11 NHL games before fracturing his leg, and Everberg saw action in 55 Avs games between multiple injury stints.\n\nThis season, they will be far better prepared to contribute when called upon.\n\n\u201cWe get each other on the ice,\u201d said Rendulic, who is donning a full face mask since taking a puck to the mouth and losing or dislodging teeth in training camp Saturday. \u201cHishon in the middle between two guys playing a little European style \u2014 he\u2019s good with the puck, and you just have to find the open spot and he\u2019ll give it to you.\n\n\u201cIt was a good game, I think. And I think we can only get better.\u201d\n\nHishon\u2019s future is somewhat up in the air. His size \u2014 listed at 5-foot-10 and 170 pounds \u2014 is a detriment as a third- or fourth-line NHL center. But he\u2019s a solid backup plan if Duchene or the Avs\u2019 other top center, newcomer Carl Soderberg, is injured. Hishon signed a one-year, two-way contract this summer and will again be an unrestricted free agent next year.\n\nThe other impressive lines Sunday were newcomer Mikhail Grigorenko between Alex Tanguay and Nathan MacKinnon, and Soderberg and his wingers Gabe Landeskog and rookie Mikko Rantanen.\n\nAlso, former Wisconsin Badgers Jack Skille and Ben Street played the wings flanking 19-year-old Julien Nantel, and all three picked up a point on Skille\u2019s goal that gave White a 3-0 lead, on its way to a 3-1 victory.\n\nMike Chambers: mchambers@ denverpost.com or @mikechambers", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Three 23-year-olds came up aces in Avs annual intrasquad scrimmage", "title": "Three 23-year-olds came up aces in Avs annual intrasquad scrimmage", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/09/20/three-23-year-olds-came-up-aces-in-avs-annual-intrasquad-scrimmage/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150920__avs-hishonp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150920__avs-hishonp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-20T20:28:51+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T20:39:29+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "But like Everberg and Rendulic, Martinsen will require some North American seasoning and probably end up in San Antonio.\nBecause of injuries and a lack of depth, Rendulic played 11 NHL games before fracturing his leg, and Everberg saw action in 55 Avs games between multiple injury stints.\nIt\u2019s nice to see.\u201dBased on contracts, Hishon, Rendulic and Everberg will probably begin the season in the American Hockey League, playing for the San Antonio Rampage.\nHishon and European-born wingers Borna Rendulic and Dennis Everberg didn\u2019t score until late in the third period at Magness Arena \u2014 and their team lost \u2014 but for evaluation purposes, the three 23-year-olds came up aces in the annual Burgundy-White intrasquad scrimmage.\nBut he\u2019s a solid backup plan if Duchene or the Avs\u2019 other top center, newcomer Carl Soderberg, is injured."}
