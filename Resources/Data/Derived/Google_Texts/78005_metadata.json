Clinton challenged Obama to honor his words to the American people that their insurance would not be lost in the process.\n\n\"I personally believe, even if it takes changing the law, the president should honor the commitment the federal government made to those people and let them keep what they got,\" Clinton told OZY TV.\n\nRepublicans like Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) jumped all over that comment, accusing Clinton of distancing himself from the president on behalf of his wife, Hillary.\n\n\u201cThat was certainly revealing, and it suggests perhaps that Hillary Clinton is looking to run away from President Obama and Obamacare,\" Cruz said the following day. \"And that ought to be a signal to Democrats. This thing isn\u2019t working.\"\n\nIn a press conference hours after the Nov. 12 Clinton interview emerged, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said that Obama agreed. Two days later, the president announced a fix that would allow the sale of canceled individual health insurance policies to existing customers.\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Two-Term Presidents Two-Term Presidents\n\n1 of 21 George Washington (1789-97) 1st President of the United States (Photo by Three Lions/Getty Images) Share this slide:\n\nGetty File", "article_metadata": {"description": "Former President Bill Clinton clarified s...", "sailthru.expire_date": "2013-12-04 16:41:54 -0500", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "Former President Bill Clinton clarified s...", "title": "Bill Clinton: Obamacare Comments Were Meant To Be 'Supportive'", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/03/bill-clinton-obamacare_n_4379807.html", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1495026/images/o-BILL-CLINTON-facebook.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Former President Bill Clinton clarified s...", "title": "Bill Clinton: Obamacare Comments Were Meant To Be 'Supportive'", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1495026/images/o-BILL-CLINTON-facebook.jpg", "height": 1000}, "creator": "cgentilviso", "site": "@HuffPostPol", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-12-03 16:41:54 -0500", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=4379807", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "Bill Clinton,bill clinton obamacare,video,obamacare,health care law,health care reform,Bill Clinton Health Care,obama,Bill Clinton Obama", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "Bill Clinton,bill clinton obamacare,video,obamacare,health care law,health care reform,Bill Clinton Health Care,obama,Bill Clinton Obama", "published_time": "2013-12-03 16:41:54 -0500", "modified_time": "2013-12-04 11:22:56 -0500"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde304\"", "article_summary": "Former President Bill Clinton clarified some tough comments he made about the Affordable Care Act earlier this month, vowing that there was no ill will attached.\n\u201cThat was certainly revealing, and it suggests perhaps that Hillary Clinton is looking to run away from President Obama and Obamacare,\" Cruz said the following day.\nIn a Tuesday interview with CNN Espanol, Clinton explained that he was fully behind President Barack Obama's health care efforts.\nTwo days later, the president announced a fix that would allow the sale of canceled individual health insurance policies to existing customers.\nIn a press conference hours after the Nov. 12 Clinton interview emerged, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said that Obama agreed."}
