Monday night, Seth Meyers mocked Donald Trump for advocating scrapping Obamacare and replacing it with\u2026. \u201csomething.\u201d He\u2019s not really sure what, but it\u2019ll certainly be\u2026. \u201csomething.\u201d\n\nTrump told CNN\u2019s Danna Bash he wants to \u201ctake care of everybody\u201d but when she pressed him on how to do it, he had no policy suggestions. \u201cRepeal and replace with something terrific,\u201d is Trump\u2019s policy proposal.\n\n\u201cOh!\u201d Meyers shouted in response. \u201cOh, something terrific! Trump talks in interviews like someone is giving him answers in his earpiece and the feed just cut out.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s plan is about the same as the rest of the Republican party, however. Nothing. \u201cInstead of providing subsidies and setting up exchanges, which Obamacare does, they claim consumers should be able to save money by buying insurance policies in other states.\u201d\n\nMeyers then showed a clip of Trump talking about how we need to bring the \u201cprivate sector in\u201d and \u201cget rid of the borders,\u201d meaning the state borders. Trump explained that borders are bad when you\u2019re talking about health care. \u201cWatch that moment of existential panic when Trump realized he was arguing against borders,\u201d Meyers said showing this \u201coh sh*t\u201d face:\n\nThe problem with the logic is that a policy might be cheaper in Utah and a New Yorker could buy it, but it might not provide a solid option of available doctors in New York. Who can manage to fly to Utah when they need an emergency appendectomy?\n\nColorado might go a different route, scrapping Obamacare plan and trying out single-payer. Amendment 69 is called Colorado Care and would provide exactly that kind of plan. \u201cThat\u2019s right, the state that was one of the first to legalize weed in the U.S. can now also become the first to pass single-payer health care. Colorado doesn\u2019t care what the rest of the country thinks. Next, they\u2019re going to change the state bird to the middle finger. They even call it Amendment 69, because, in this plan, everyone gets taken care of.\u201d\n\nThe difference between the current system is a single-payer vs. multi-payer system is the state pays doctors and hospitals vs. what amounts to a cluster-f*ck. \u201cIn the cluster-f*ck system it seems like everyone\u2019s getting taken care of, but half the people are just getting screwed.\u201d The cluster-f*ck system also ends up with wildly different prices for what amounts to the exact same thing depending on your plan and even hospitals that are within miles of each other or across state lines.\n\nIn Cleveland, Ohio, for example, you can get an ultrasound for $522 but an hour away in Canton, Ohio, it costs only $183. \u201cOur healthcare system is like if there was an Outback Steakhouse, where, depending on your table, your bloomin\u2019 onion is either $7.99 or $1,100.\u201d\n\nThe Koch Brothers notoriously attacked Obamacare with their creepy ad of Uncle Sam giving a woman a pap smear, but this time, they\u2019re fighting Colorado\u2019s law with ads that basically predict Armageddon. The United States remains the only wealthy nation in the world without a publicly financed, universal health care system. Other countries are spending as much as 80 percent less of what the U.S. is on out of pocket health costs.\n\n\u201cThe French spend less on health care than us and they use cigarettes as pacifiers,\u201d Meyers joked.\n\nCheck out the full report below:\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-03-at-6.51.05-AM-800x430.png", "height": 430}, "title": "Seth Meyers praises Colorado for giving Donald Trump the middle finger and going single payer"}, "fb": {"app_id": 212555972273585}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "article_summary": "The United States remains the only wealthy nation in the world without a publicly financed, universal health care system.\n\u201cThe French spend less on health care than us and they use cigarettes as pacifiers,\u201d Meyers joked.\nMonday night, Seth Meyers mocked Donald Trump for advocating scrapping Obamacare and replacing it with\u2026.\nColorado might go a different route, scrapping Obamacare plan and trying out single-payer.\nTrump explained that borders are bad when you\u2019re talking about health care."}
