Money is lost. Property is destroyed. People get hurt and killed. Riots become a reason to institute martial law and brutalize citizens, generally with little regard for what those citizens did in the riot.\n\nPeople who participate in riots don\u2019t tend to be happy at the time or look back fondly on their memories of them afterward. People who get disingenuously accused of \u201cliking\u201d riots hardly ever express anything close to an actual \u201cpro-riot\u201d sentiment.\n\nLet\u2019s get something else clear right away \u2014 the term \u201criot\u201d isn\u2019t all that useful. It describes any disorganized outbreak of violence, but people running out and breaking things for the fun of it is not the same as violence in response to ongoing injustice.\n\nAnd the outbreak of violence by the oppressed is not at all equivalent to the outbreak of violence by the oppressors; a \u201crace riot\u201d is a term for two very different phenomena. The destruction wrought by minorities who are \u201cpunching up\u201d is partial and temporary; meanwhile when an oppressive majority decides to punch down, the destruction tends to be total and permanent.\n\nThat asymmetry is the fundamental problem with violence as a tool of revolution. Of all the ways to try to strike back against oppression, violent insurrection is one of the costliest, most painful ones for the people doing it\u2013the brunt of the economic and personal damage ends up borne by the oppressed, not their oppressors. Violent resistance is a dangerous gamble that the attention drawn to the cause will outweigh the bloodshed likely to follow in the name of \u201claw and order\u201d\u2013and it was this tactical consideration, as much as spiritual considerations, that made Martin Luther King Jr. preach pacifism.\n\nIf you want a hot take from someone on why rioting isn\u2019t a good thing but also isn\u2019t some terrifying harbinger of total anarchy, Dr. King already gave the definitive one 48 years ago. Yes, he famously and forcefully condemned the \u201cLong Hot Summer\u201d race riots of 1967 in his \u201cWhere Do We Go From Here\u201d speech, but went on the following month to challenge the nation\u2019s social scientists to get past facile, simplistic \u201cRiots are barbaric and bad\u201d rhetoric. His diagnosis was that riots are a painful symptom of oppression\u2013and, like most painful symptoms, useful as a warning but dangerous as a distraction.\n\nThe real danger? That the complacent middle-class TV news-watcher\u2019s emotional reaction to broken windows and burning buildings drown out any possible understanding of the long ongoing history for which riots merely serve as colorful punctuation.\n\nThat\u2019s the worst result that can come of violent unrest\u2013all the times it has, as Dr. King lamented, failed to change anything and indeed provided ammunition for the opponents of change. In 1992 an act of police brutality went viral and the city of Los Angeles burned; afterward, the LAPD not only failed to reform but spent the next five years getting worse, with the riots themselves serving as handy justification for police brutality. It\u2019s this knowledge that can make a man like David Simon utter chilling words of empathy for an angry young man with a brick in his hand while nonetheless pleading for that young man to stay home.\n\nBut Dr. King didn\u2019t spend that much time condemning riots\u2013he spent far more of his time condemning people who spent all of their time condemning riots. Hence the 1968 quote spreading through Twitter like wildfire, that \u201ca riot is the language of the unheard.\u201d King understood that trying to solve the problem of \u201criots\u201d instead of trying to solve the problem of oppression is like feeding painkillers to a patient with a gushing open wound. That broken windows matter less than broken spines\u2013and as long as spines are being broken, no condemnation from you or me or Dr. King himself will stop windows from being broken in response.\n\nKing\u2019s charisma and rhetoric did not, as some mythologists like to pretend, quell all violence during the civil rights era. The civil rights movement was never, at any point, a monolithic chorus of peace and love; King constantly struggled to maintain his ideals of nonviolence against the backdrop of the Harlem Riot, the Watts Riots, the Long Hot Summer. When King paid the ultimate price for his ideals and was assassinated in 1968, President Johnson\u2019s response to the ensuing violence was a weary \u201cWhat did you expect?\u201d\n\nWhen your sons and daughters are shot dead in the street and the state refuses to so much as apologize, someone, somewhere is going to pick up a brick. When a people go unheard for generations, someone is going to scream. When you take your foot off a man\u2019s neck, he\u2019s going to knock your block off. To expect otherwise is to expect oppressed people to be inhuman.\n\nTo draw a false equivalence and claim that rioting and violence taint a cause, make the oppressed just as bad as the oppressors\u2013by that standard nothing Martin Luther King accomplished is untainted, with violence breaking out among his followers despite his best efforts throughout his life and following his death.\n\nBut let\u2019s not stop there. If the taint of violence delegitimizes any cause it touches then there\u2019s plenty of condemnation to go around. No white LGBT American who attends pride parades that celebrate Stonewall ought to condemn \u201crioting\u201d with a straight face. Nor any white woman who enjoys the right to vote. Or anyone, regardless of race, who enjoys the benefits of a 40-hour work week.", "article_metadata": {"description": "We don\u2019t live in an ideal world where oppressors calmly hear out people they oppress before the sh*t hits the fan", "title": "\u201cI condemn the riots in the same breath that I condemn the police brutality, the systemic racism, the disenfranchisement of black America\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "We don\u2019t live in an ideal world where oppressors calmly hear out people they oppress before the sh*t hits the fan", "title": "\u201cI condemn the riots in the same breath that I condemn the police brutality, the systemic racism, the disenfranchisement of black America\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/02/i_condemn_the_riots_in_the_same_breath_that_i_condemn_the_police_brutality_the_systemic_racism_the_disenfranchisement_of_black_america/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/AP314729518409-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "We don\u2019t live in an ideal world where oppressors calmly hear out people they oppress before the sh*t hits the fan", "title": "\u201cI condemn the riots in the same breath that I condemn the police brutality, the systemic racism, the disenfranchisement of black America\u201d", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/AP314729518409-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Arthur Chu", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Baltimore, Baltimore protests, Editor's Picks, freddie gray, LGBT Rights, Martin Luther King, police violence, Property, Race, Riots", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "But Dr. King didn\u2019t spend that much time condemning riots\u2013he spent far more of his time condemning people who spent all of their time condemning riots.\nTopics: Baltimore, Baltimore protests, Editor's Picks, freddie gray, LGBT Rights, Martin Luther King, police violence, Property, Race, Riots, News, Politics NewsThis story has been corrected since it was originally published.\nThat\u2019s the worst result that can come of violent unrest\u2013all the times it has, as Dr. King lamented, failed to change anything and indeed provided ammunition for the opponents of change.\nRiots become a reason to institute martial law and brutalize citizens, generally with little regard for what those citizens did in the riot.\nThat broken windows matter less than broken spines\u2013and as long as spines are being broken, no condemnation from you or me or Dr. King himself will stop windows from being broken in response."}
