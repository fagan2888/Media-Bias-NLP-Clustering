Call Congress at 1-844-259-9351 to ask your representative to oppose this amendment.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis last minute backroom deal would, for the first time, amend the pension law to allow the earned vested benefits of retirees to be cut. After a lifetime of hard work to earn their pensions, retirees don\u2019t deserve to receive a bad deal, in which they\u2019ve had no say, cut behind closed doors and excluding the very people who would be impacted most.\u201d\n\nIn a letter sent to members of the House and Senate last week, Rogers added \u201c[This] proposal\u2026impairs a fundamental tenet of pension law and permits multiemployer pension plans to cut the earned and vested pension benefits of current retirees. Making significant and far-reaching changes to pension law without scrutiny of the legislative proposal and with no opportunity for debate or amendment is unacceptable. This is all the more true given that the proposal may result in a significant reduction in the modest income of millions of retirees. We urge Congress to instead consider all possible alternatives, and to allow time for adequate debate that can produce a fair and reasonable solution to the funding challenges facing a handful of multiemployer plans.\n\n# # #\n\nAbout AARP\n\nAARP is a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization, with a membership of nearly 38 million, that helps people turn their goals and dreams into real possibilities, strengthens communities and fights for the issues that matter most to families such as healthcare, employment and income security, retirement planning, affordable utilities and protection from financial abuse.
