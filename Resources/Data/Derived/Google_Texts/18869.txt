Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump is defending his use of the word “schlonged” to describe Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton’s loss in the 2008 Democratic presidential primary, saying it’s an oft-used phrase in politics that means “beaten badly.”

“Once again, #MSM is dishonest. ‘Schlonged’ is not vulgar. When I said Hillary got ‘schlonged’ that meant beaten badly,” Mr. Trump tweeted Tuesday evening, referring to the “mainstream media.”

Mr. Trump said an NPR reporter used it to describe the resounding loss of the 1984 Democratic presidential ticket of Walter Mondale and Geraldine Ferraro.

“For those on TV defending my use of the word ‘schlonged,’ bc #MSM is giving it false meaning-tell them it means beaten badly. Dishonest #MSM,” he also tweeted.

At a Monday rally in Michigan, Mr. Trump had said: “Everything that’s been involved in Hillary has been losses.”

“Even her race to Obama — she was going to beat Obama. … How does it get worse? But she was going to beat, she was favored to win, and she got schlonged. She lost,” Mr. Trump said.

The word “schlong” is a slang Yiddish term for penis, but Mr. Trump said he wasn’t using it that way.

“When I said that Hillary Clinton got schlonged by Obama, it meant got beaten badly. The media knows this. Often used word in politics!” he tweeted.

The pitch continued into early Wednesday morning.

“It is a shame that the biased media is able to so incorrectly define a word for the public when they know that the definition is wrong. Sad!” he tweeted.
