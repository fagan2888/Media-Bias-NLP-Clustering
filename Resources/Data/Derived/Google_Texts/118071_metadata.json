Dallas dentist David Alameel received 47.1 percent of the vote, and political activist Kesha Rogers garnered 21.7 percent. Texas Democrats will choose between the two of them in a runoff contest Tuesday. The winner will face a long-shot bid against incumbent Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas).\n\nThe results were somewhat embarrassing for the Texas Democratic Party. Rogers is a follower of Lyndon LaRouche, who heads a fringe political movement that has been compared to a cult. His supporters are often seen carrying signs depicting Obama with a Hitler mustache. One of Rogers' own campaign posters features that image, and reads, \"Down with the Traitor! Impeach!\"\n\nRogers has compared Obamacare to the policies of the Nazi regime.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Kesha Rogers, a follower of the controversial Lyndon LaRouche movement, has lost the Democratic primary runoff in Texas' Senate race, the", "sailthru.expire_date": "2014-05-28 21:09:01 -0400", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "Kesha Rogers, a follower of the controversial Lyndon LaRouche movement, has lost the Democratic primary runoff in Texas' Senate race, the", "title": "Controversial Democrat Loses Primary", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/05/27/kesha-rogers-runoff_n_5393630.html", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1657757/images/o-KESHA-ROGERS-facebook.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Kesha Rogers, a follower of the controversial Lyndon LaRouche movement, has lost the Democratic primary runoff in Texas' Senate race, the", "creator": "molliereilly", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1657757/images/o-KESHA-ROGERS-facebook.jpg", "height": 1000}, "title": "Controversial Democrat Loses Primary", "site": "@HuffPostPol", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-05-27 21:09:01 -0400", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=5393630", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "elections 2014,texas election 2014,texas senate runoff results,texas runoff,kesha rogers runoff,david alameel kesha rogers,Kesha Rogers,Texas election,texas senate runoff,video,texas runoff election,texas senate primary,texas runoff 2014,kesha rogers david alameel,david alameel runoff,david alameel,david alameel senate,2014 election,texas election results,kesha rogers senate,texas senate runoff 2014,texas runoff results", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "elections 2014,texas election 2014,texas senate runoff results,texas runoff,kesha rogers runoff,david alameel kesha rogers,Kesha Rogers,Texas election,texas senate runoff,video,texas runoff election,texas senate primary,texas runoff 2014,kesha rogers david alameel,david alameel runoff,david alameel,david alameel senate,2014 election,texas election results,kesha rogers senate,texas senate runoff 2014,texas runoff results", "published_time": "2014-05-27 21:09:01 -0400", "modified_time": "2014-05-28 11:59:01 -0400"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3638\"", "article_summary": "Kesha Rogers, a follower of the controversial Lyndon LaRouche movement, has lost the Democratic primary runoff in Texas' Senate race, the Associated Press reports .\nRogers was bested by Dallas dentist David Alameel, who was backed by the Texas Democratic Party.\nRogers is a follower of Lyndon LaRouche, who heads a fringe political movement that has been compared to a cult.\nThe results were somewhat embarrassing for the Texas Democratic Party.\nDallas dentist David Alameel received 47.1 percent of the vote, and political activist Kesha Rogers garnered 21.7 percent."}
