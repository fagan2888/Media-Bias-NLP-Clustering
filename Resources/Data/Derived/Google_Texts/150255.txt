We all know that the volcanic eruption of Bardarbunga volcano caused worldwide havoc in 2010. The ejected ash cloud into the sky blanketed Europe's airspace for six days, causing travel disruption for millions of passengers.

The volcano is more than 2000m above sea level and is covered by a huge ice cap, with Vatnajokull glacier hiding its crater.

Iceland's Meteorological Office has reported a danger of another eruption. Bardarbunga volcano lies underneath the northwestern part of the Vatnajokull glacier. An intense seismic activity and magma flow has been recorded by the meteorologists. The recordings reveal that the land below Vatnajokull glacier has drifted apart by 20 centimeters (8 inches).

Geophysicist _ora Arnadottir from the University of Iceland's Earth Science Institute said, "The continental drift is two centimeters per year, so this is ten times the natural continental drift".

Since the onset of the activity a week ago, approximately 2,600 earthquakes have been picked up by sensors of earthquake monitory network of the Icelandic Meteorological Office (IMO) between early Saturday morning and Monday evening . Several of these incidents were larger than magnitude 3.

Although it's not showing signs of eruption just yet, authorities have put airlines on alert, raising the risk level of flying over the region to a code orange - the second highest on a five-level scale.

The Bardarbunga volcano erupting could cause than the usual catastrophic amount of damage and disruption. According to Kristin Jonsdottir, the Scientific Coordinator at the Icelandic Earthquake Monitoring Office, the mountain could also reach equilibrium and return to normal.

Thanks to the chaos faced in 2010, experts have now dramatically improved understanding of the impact of an ash cloud on aircraft. So if there will be an explosion, everything is expected to be taken care of.
