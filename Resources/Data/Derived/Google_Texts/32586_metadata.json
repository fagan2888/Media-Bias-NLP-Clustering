Mary Landrieu is flailing. She doesn\u2019t own a home in Louisiana, but insists that her 7,300 square foot, $2.5 million house on Capitol Hill isn\u2019t a \u201cmansion.\u201d She\u2019s attacked her main Republican opponent for being soft on immigration, hoping that voters will pay no heed to her own voting record and rhetoric. She says she supports the Keystone pipeline and \u201cfixes\u201d to Obamacare (for which she cast the deciding vote and pledged to be \u201c100 percent\u201d accountable), but hasn\u2019t been influential enough to persuade her own party\u2019s leadership to allow votes on either issue. And Sean Trende\u2019s deep data dive portends ominous things for the three-term incumbent. So do the polls. According to a fresh USA Today/Suffolk survey, Landrieu is attracting just 36 percent of the \u201cjungle primary\u201d vote, with her top two GOP opponents combining for 46 percent of the vote. In the very likely event of an early December run-off, Landrieu is frozen in the low 40\u2019s and trailing Bill Cassidy by seven points:\n\nThe Suffolk University poll, conducted for WWL-TV, USA Today and Gannett Louisiana newspapers, shows the two frontrunners in essentially a statistical dead heat, with 36 percent of those surveyed saying they would vote for incumbent Sen. Mary Landrieu in the Nov. 4 primary. 35 percent chose Rep. Bill Cassidy and 11 percent chose Tea Party-backed candidate Col. Rob Maness. 18 percent were undecided or chose other candidates...If, as expected, the race goes to a Dec. 6 runoff between the two frontrunners, those polled favored Cassidy 48 percent to 41 percent, with still 11 percent undecided. Paleologos says Maness will be an ally to Landrieu in November, keeping votes away from Cassidy, but that won\u2019t be the case in the runoff. \u201cIn December, Rob Maness isn\u2019t going to be an ally because his voters \u2013 89 percent of them \u2013 say they are unfavorable to the senator, so that\u2019s a problem for her,\u201d Paleologos said.\n\nLandrieu\u2019s biggest problem? This guy:\n\nThe president\u2019s approval rating is underwater by 28 points in Louisiana, translating into an ugly (38/54) number for the state\u2019s Democratic Senator. As Obama himself said, his allies in Congress are strong supporters of his agenda \u2014 and few have been more steadfast than Mary Landrieu:\n\nICYMI the 2014 Rubber Stamp Club\u2026 makes you wonder if they assumed 2014 scores wouldn\u2019t be out before the election. pic.twitter.com/Ijf1WsP3dy \u2014 Phil Kerpen (@kerpen) October 27, 2014\n\nAt a recent debate, Landrieu rated Obama\u2019s job performance as a 7/10 \u2014 which is a far more generous score than most Louisianans would give, yet doesn\u2019t even begin to reflect Landrieu\u2019s stratospheric pro-Obama voting record. Elsewhere in contested Senate races, polls are spouting up everywhere. In addition to Sunday\u2019s polling avalanche, a new High Point University survey shows North Carolina\u2019s race all knotted up, with incumbent Sen. Kay Hagan still treading water in the mid-40\u2019s (no wonder she and her supporters are stooping to these racial lows), while Rasmussen shows Cory Gardner breaking 50 and leading by six points in Colorado. I take all Rasmussen polls with grains of salt, but the (+6) margin is right in line with other recent numbers from Quinnipiac and Suffolk/USA Today. Meanwhile, up in Alaska, Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski is (again) spitting bullets at embattled Democrat Mark Begich. The Begich campaign has now used her likeness in two separate television ads without her permission, in a shameless effort to imply that she supports his re-election. When GOP challenger Dan Sullivan called Begich out on this point at a debate, the incumbent claimed that Murkowski was only upset because she didn\u2019t like how she looked in the photo. Murkowski unloads:\n\n\u201cThat is belittling,\u201d Murkowski said. \u201cI think I made very clear that I had objections, serious objections, to how that ad portrayed our relationship. It was an implied endorsement, and I didn\u2019t appreciate that. I think Begich knows where I stand in this race. Again, no means no.\u201d\n\nAlaska\u2019s senior senator is sufficiently popular to have won a statewide write-in campaign in 2010 after losing the GOP primary. Despite that episode of intra-party tension, she\u2019s been a strong team player in the Sullivan/Begich race:\n\nI\u2019ll leave you with this softer, longer-form biographical piece on Dan Sullivan from the NRSC. Based on his background, resume and choices, Sullivan seems like a high caliber individual:\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Plus: Updates from North Carolina, Colorado & Alaska.", "title": "New poll confirms: Mary Landrieu\u2019s in serious trouble, y\u2019all", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/10/27/new-poll-confirms-mary-landrieus-in-serious-trouble-yall/", "image": "https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3936/15643118235_e9430cd055.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@JazzShaw"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-10-27T22:01:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-27T23:04:34+00:00"}, "keywords": "2014 Senate, Louisian, Mary Landrieu, polls,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbbcb\"", "article_summary": "New poll confirms: Mary Landrieu\u2019s in serious trouble, y\u2019allposted at 6:01 pm on October 27, 2014 by Guy BensonSen.
