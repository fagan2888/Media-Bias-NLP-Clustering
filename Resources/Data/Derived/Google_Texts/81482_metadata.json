Click here to learn more.\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 When it comes to various services in the D.C. area, how do you know you\u2019re getting the best bang for your buck?\n\nWashington Checkbook Magazine has some tips when it comes to getting the best value for services and products such as health care, tools and tires.\n\nThe magazine\u2019s president, Robert Krughoff, spoke with WTOP about some highlights from the magazine\u2019s research on savings.\n\nVeterinarians\n\nThe magazine evaluated 222 area vets and found big differences in quality and price. For example, to neuter a 6-month-old, 30-pound dog, vets charged between $154 and $830.\n\nThe difference in price can mirror the quality of care, but Krughoff says sometimes consumers don\u2019t shop around enough to know a bad price when they see it.\n\n\u201cI think people really tend not to shop very much for the price of vets, so they don\u2019t know better,\u201d he says. \u201cThey don\u2019t really realize when they are paying $800 for a service they could have had for $150 or $200.\u201d\n\nYou should look for whether the vet takes your finances into consideration and discusses various treatment options with you. Also, pet owners need a vet who is reachable by phone and available in case of an emergency.\n\nHardware Stores\n\nMany D.C.-area shoppers grapple with whether they should shop at bigger hardware stores or smaller, independent shops. Krughoff says bigger stores may have more savings and more items, but they may not focus on the customers\u2019 needs.\n\nLowe\u2019s and Home Depot are, on average, 25 percent less expensive than independent hardware stores in the area, the magazine found.\n\nExperienced clerks can be an asset in a hardware store \u2014 they can act as consultants and teachers. And some independent stores may have better clerks, the magazine found.\n\n\u201cIf you go to a good hardware store, you can expect that kind of really good helpful advice; and some of the independents stores actually rated very high in the quality of advice you get \u2014 much higher than the quality of advice you get in the Lowe\u2019s and Home Depot,\u201d Krughoff says.\n\nLarger stores may have volume and variety, but some small stores have an impressive selection, too.\n\n\u201cIndependent stores \u2014 though they don\u2019t have near as much space \u2014 have an enormous amount of variety, and actually know how to find it and know where it is, and they can tailor that variety to their neighborhood \u2014 things that people in that neighborhood tend to need,\u201d he adds.\n\nThere can be big price differences: 50 feet of copper piping can cost between $58 and $150 at area hardware stores.\n\nTires\n\nCheckbook found that one set of Michelin tires \u2014 and the installation and rotation that come with them \u2014 can cost anywhere between $934 and $1,360.\n\nThe lowest prices locally were found at Walmart, Costco, BJs, Sams Club, NTB and Sears. Dealerships tended to cost the most, Krughoff says.\n\nOne alternative to save money is to shop for tires online, he says.\n\n\u201cYou can have them shipped to you and you can pay your local repair shop to do the installation,\u201d Krughoff says.\n\nAnd taking good care of your tires can be a way to save money in the long run, he adds.\n\nPest Control\n\nThere is a big difference in the quality of area pest-control companies, Krughoff says. Checkbook evaluated 88 local pest control services.\n\nIndependent companies ranked better than some of the bigger-name companies such as Orkin. The independent ones ranked better because customers saw better results based on cost, Krughoff says.\n\nWhile some charge $150 or less for a single visit, others require customers to sign up for long-term contracts that cost $450 or more.\n\n\u201cCheckbook finds so often there is no relationship between quality and price,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are really high-quality firms that will do great work that are among the lowest price firms in the area, so you don\u2019t need to pay more.\u201d\n\nAsking about a company\u2019s strategy and guarantee are important when choosing which company to go with.\n\nHouse cleaners\n\nThose who want to get their house cleaned may have a hard time deciding whether to go with a company or an individual.\n\nCheckbook surveyed D.C.-area residents and found that most were more likely to be happy with individuals instead of companies \u2014 76 percent gave individuals a superior score, as opposed to the 54 percent who gave companies a superior ranking.\n\n\u201cThese people are coming into your home, so if you find a good person, you are more likely to be satisfied,\u201d Krughoff says.\n\nCheckbook also found there can be big price differences. For one three-bedroom, two-bathroom house cleaning, prices ranged between $75 and $185.\n\nThe best way to prevent surprises is to call first and get a quote. Then, get the price guarantee in writing.\n\n\u201cWhen you have a [house cleaner] come to your home, get them to write down what\u2019s going to get done and what the price will be,\u201d he says.\n\nCustomers should also evaluate how often they want to get their house cleaned.\n\n\u201cIt tends to be substantially cheaper to have someone come once a week or every two weeks, as opposed to one-time cleanings,\u201d he adds.\n\nDoctors\n\nCheckbook asked practicing doctors in the area to identify physician specialists they \u201cwould consider most desirable for care of a loved one.\u201d\n\nThere is a close relationship between the doctors\u2019 ratings and their quality of care, he says.\n\n\u201cDoctors who are recommended by other doctors are much more likely to be board-certified; they are very unlikely to have disciplinary actions against them,\u201d Krughoff says.\n\nKrughoff has some recommendations to make sure patients get the most bang for their buck:\n\nMake sure it\u2019s easy to communicate with the doctor.\n\nFind a doctor who explains things to you.\n\nBe able to get an appointment and see the doctor within a day or two.\n\nHave a doctor who can talk about preventative measure with you.\n\nFollow @WTOP on Twitter and WTOP on Facebook.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://wtop.com/wp-content/themes/wtop/assets/img/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://wtop.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/346167-150x150.jpg", "news_keywords": "checkbook magazine", "og": {"site_name": "WTOP", "description": "WASHINGTON \u2014\u00a0When it comes to various services in the D.C. area, how do you know you\u2019re getting the best bang for your buck?
