And that talk quickly settled on one question.\n\n\u201cSo without Kyrie Irving the Cavaliers are done, right?\u201d\n\nThe short answer is probably.\n\nThe longer answer starts with, \u201cBut you can\u2019t really count out any team that has LeBron James.\u201d\n\nAnd so on.\n\nAs big a blow to Cleveland\u2019s title hopes as Irving\u2019s season-ending broken kneecap is, it could have bigger consequences for the record-setting television audience that watched Game 1 of the NBA Finals on Thursday night.\n\nIf fans believe the best-of-seven series is now done-and-dusted, will they still tune in?\n\nThis is where NBA commissioner Adam Silver comes in.\n\nThe injuries that marred the playoffs have now infiltrated the Finals. And for a league that needs its stars, that revolves around its stars, this simply will not do.\n\nTo be fair, Silver\u2019s first concern is the well-being of his league\u2019s players over any damage their absence does to TV ratings. But in both cases the most perplexing question remains the same.\n\nWhat can anyone really do to prevent it?\n\nSilver addressed the issue with USA Today last week.\n\n\u201cWhether or not there\u2019s more we can do to prevent injuries is something we\u2019re very focused on,\u201d Silver said. \u201cIt\u2019s always been part of the game \u2014 injuries happen, and they happen to high-profile players, they happen to guys who aren\u2019t so high profile. Whether there\u2019s better training practices, whether through better analytics, we can get a sense of what precise movements lead to injuries, whether it\u2019s a function of the schedule are all things that we\u2019re (looking at).\u201d\n\nComplicating matters is that the injuries aren\u2019t focused in one area; they\u2019re all over the place \u2014 Irving\u2019s kneecap, Kevin Love\u2019s dislocated shoulder, DeMarre Carroll\u2019s sprained knee, John Wall\u2019s five nondisplaced hand fractures, Wesley Matthews\u2019 torn Achilles tendon, Mike Conley\u2019s plantar fasciitis and facial fractures.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThey have come with no contact and with harsh contact. This is as elusive a moving target as there is, and yet as important an issue as any the league must solve.\n\n\u201cLike I said, it\u2019s not a new issue, but from a league standpoint things we can do is take the league resources by bringing together data from all 30 teams and not making it a solitary issue for any team or any given player,\u201d Silver told USA Today. \u201cAnd trying to figure out the optimal amount of training players should be doing. I mean frankly, maybe they\u2019re working too hard. I mean, talk to a guy like (NBA president of basketball operations) Rod Thorn, who has been with the league 50 years, and he\u2019ll tell you that in his day (players) took more time off in the summer. Maybe that\u2019s what\u2019s necessary.\u201d\n\nOr maybe the random nature of it all makes it just terrible coincidence this season.\n\nWho knows?\n\nTwo weeks ago, this space contained a column that acknowledged the injury bug while noting the NBA had been able to navigate those waters without catastrophic damage to the overall quality of the playoffs. That is no longer the case.\n\nAt least understanding what could be happening, if there is science that can help, is a necessary start.\n\nBecause the last thing the NBA needs are games decided \u2014 or even perceived to be decided \u2014 when key players are injured and unable to finish.\n\nChristopher Dempsey: cdempsey @denverpost.com or twitter.com/ dempseypost", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Dempsey: Are the the Cavaliers done without Kyrie Irving?", "title": "Dempsey: Are the the Cavaliers done without Kyrie Irving?", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/06/06/dempsey-are-the-the-cavaliers-done-without-kyrie-irving/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150605__476029318p1.jpg", "height": 444}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150605__476029318p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-06T21:26:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-23T02:47:40+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Christopher Dempsey"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd192b\"", "article_summary": "At an indoor basketball court in Broomfield on Saturday morning, the chatter quickly turned to the NBA Finals.\n\u201cIt\u2019s always been part of the game \u2014 injuries happen, and they happen to high-profile players, they happen to guys who aren\u2019t so high profile.\n\u201cSo without Kyrie Irving the Cavaliers are done, right?\u201dThe short answer is probably.\nAs big a blow to Cleveland\u2019s title hopes as Irving\u2019s season-ending broken kneecap is, it could have bigger consequences for the record-setting television audience that watched Game 1 of the NBA Finals on Thursday night.\nThe longer answer starts with, \u201cBut you can\u2019t really count out any team that has LeBron James.\u201dAnd so on."}
