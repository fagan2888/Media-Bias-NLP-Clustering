Autodesk Grows 3D Technology Services with Acquisition of Solid Angle

Solid Angle's image renderer was used in the making of Birdman, which won the 2015 Academy Award for Best Picture and starred Michael Keaton

Design and engineering software developer Autodesk Inc. (Nasdaq: ADSK) has purchased 3D animation company Solid Angle for an undisclosed amount, as the target looks to expand its development and marketing resources.

Solid Angle, which has offices in Madrid and London, is known for its Arnold brand, which develops 3D image rendering technology. Solid Angle’s software has been used in films such as “The Martian," as well as popular television series including “Game of Thrones.”

“With Autodesk, we’ll be able to accelerate development as well as scale our marketing, sales and support operations for Arnold to better meet the needs of our growing user base,” says Solid Angle founder Marcos Fajardo. In another recent similar deal, private equity firm Rizvi Traverse Management LLC purchased 3D movie technology maker RealD Inc.

Autodesk designs 3D engineering and entertainment software. Since it introduced AutoCAD software in 1982, the company continues to develop a portfolio of 3D software for global markets. In 2015, the company acquired Netfabb, a developer of 3D printing software.
