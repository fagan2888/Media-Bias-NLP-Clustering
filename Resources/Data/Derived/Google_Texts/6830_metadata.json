The parking lot discussed in LiveOn NY\u2019s report appears to fall under the same zoning category.\n\nAmong other measures, Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s Zoning for Quality and Affordability (ZQA) text amendment would allow sites known as continuing care retirement communities to apply for exemptions to height and other restrictions without going through the usual review process.\n\nLocal critics have viewed that measure as designed to enable the Hebrew Home at Riverdale, located on an R1 lot, to build four mid-size towers.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Riverdale Press", "description": "The senior care industry is eyeing a property in Riverdale for new development as the mayor is seeking passage of zoning measures aimed at encouraging affordable housing.\n\nA report from LiveOn NY,  \u2026", "title": "Parking lot eyed for new senior affordable housing", "url": "http://riverdalepress.com/stories/Parking-lot-eyed-for-new-senior-affordable-housing,58600", "image": "http://riverdalepress.static2.adqic.com/uploads/original/1448473167_2745.jpg", "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Schervier Nursing Care Center, LiveOn NY, Carlos Beato, 2973 Independence Ave., affordable housing, ZQA, MIH, Shant Shahrigian", "news_keywords": "Schervier Nursing Care Center, LiveOn NY, Carlos Beato, 2973 Independence Ave., affordable housing, ZQA, MIH, Shant Shahrigian", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "The senior care industry is eyeing a property in Riverdale for new development as the mayor is seeking passage of zoning measures aimed at encouraging affordable housing.\n\nA report from LiveOn NY,  \u2026"}, "article_summary": "The parking lot discussed in LiveOn NY\u2019s report appears to fall under the same zoning category.\nPosted Wednesday, November 25, 2015 3:28 pmThe senior care industry is eyeing a property in Riverdale for new development as the mayor is seeking passage of zoning measures aimed at encouraging affordable housing.\nA report from LiveOn NY, a coalition of senior centers and other groups, cited the parking lot at 2973 Independence Ave., owned by Schervier Nursing Care Center, as one of 39 parking lots around the city that are \u201cfeasible for new senior housing development.\u201dA spokeswoman for Schervier said she was unaware of the report, called \u201cPaving the Way for New Senior Housing,\u201d and could not comment.\nLocal critics have viewed that measure as designed to enable the Hebrew Home at Riverdale, located on an R1 lot, to build four mid-size towers.\nLiveOn NY said a shortage of housing for seniors prompted it to look for underutilized parking lots at existing residences that have participated in a federal financing program known as HUD 202."}
