Opportunity Scholarship Program as an alternative for parents to transfer their kids out of a failing school district into an often safer and more effective private or religious school.\n\nLindsey Burke, a fellow in education policy at The Heritage Foundation, said the program has been a \u201cbeacon of education success\u201d in Washington that has \u201clit the way\u201d for states across the U.S. to pursue a school choice option.\n\nSince it began in 2003, the program has offered more than 6,100 scholarships worth up to $12,500 to low-income students, giving them a chance to move out of their underperforming assigned districts.\n\nA random assignment evaluation of the program found that there were significantly higher graduation rates among those students who received the vouchers, according to the Department of Education.\n\nNinety-one percent of students who used the scholarship to attend a private school of choice graduated high school, compared to the 70 percent of students who applied for, but were not awarded, a scholarship.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d be hard-pressed to find many other education programs that can deliver those types of outcomes,\u201d Burke said.\n\nDemocrats, including President Barack Obama who has attempted to defund the program each year, argue the scholarship funnels money out of the district\u2019s public school system.\n\nDespite the pushback, Burke said \u201ccongressional champions\u201d like Boehner have kept the program alive, \u201censuring D.C. children will continue to be able to access quality educational options that are safe, effective, and right for them.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "House Speaker John Boehner has invited 10 students from Washington, D.C.\u2019s inner-city Catholic schools to see Pope Francis speak Thursday.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "House Speaker John Boehner has invited 10 students from Washington, D.C.\u2019s inner-city Catholic schools to see Pope Francis speak Thursday.", "title": "Boehner Invites Inner-City Students to See Pope Francis", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150923_BoehnerOSP_Johnson.jpg", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1JqwTZu"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "House Speaker John Boehner has invited 10 students from Washington, D.C.\u2019s inner-city Catholic schools to see Pope Francis speak Thursday.", "title": "Boehner Invites Inner-City Students to See Pope Francis", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150923_BoehnerOSP_Johnson.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Education", "tag": "school choice", "published_time": "2015-09-23T21:20:17+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "D.C.
