Colorado beat the Rangers 4-3 in a shootout Nov. 13 at New York.\n\nWhat\u2019s up: Nash, 30, is having a career year with his second NHL team, scoring his NHL-leading 32nd goal in his 49th game. He is on pace to easily surpass his career high of 41 goals, set in the 2003-04 season as a 19-year-old with the Columbus Blue Jackets, and get 40 goals for the third time. Through Friday, Nash\u2019s plus-20 rating was the best of his NHL career.\n\n\n\nBackground: Nash was the No. 1 pick in the 2002 draft and reached 30 goals in seven of his eight seasons with the Blue Jackets. He is the prototype power forward, a gifted scorer in a 6-foot-4, 213-pound body. Nash was traded to the Rangers in summer 2012 \u2014 along with Steven Delisle and a third-round draft pick \u2014 for Artem Anisimov, Brandon Dubinsky, Tim Erixon and a 2013 first-round draft pick.\n\nChambers\u2019 take: Nash is on pace to score 500 goals by age 34, but his Hockey Hall of Fame candidacy will depend on what he does in the playoffs the rest of his career. In the 2013 and 2014 postseasons, the Rangers played a total of 37 games, but Nash scored only four goals. He is getting $7.9 million this season and is under contract through 2017-18.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "NHL,Rick Nash,Spotlight", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "All Things Avalanche", "description": "Rick Nash, 30, is having a career year with his second NHL team, scoring his NHL-leading 32nd goal in his 49th game.", "title": "Rick Nash: Spotlight on the Rangers left wing", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/avs/2015/02/07/rick-nash-spotlight-rangers-left-wing/20781/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/avs/files/2015/02/hkn-rangers.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Rick Nash, 30, is having a career year with his second NHL team, scoring his NHL-leading 32nd goal in his 49th game.", "title": "Rick Nash: Spotlight on the Rangers left wing", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/avs/2015/02/07/rick-nash-spotlight-rangers-left-wing/20781/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/avs/files/2015/02/hkn-rangers.jpg", "creator": "@mikechambers", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "language": "en, sv", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Rick Nash, 30, is having a career year with his second NHL team, scoring his NHL-leading 32nd goal in his 49th game."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0e24\"", "article_summary": "Spotlight on\u2026 Rick Nash, left wing, RangersWhen: New York plays the Avs on Thursday, the Rangers\u2019 annual visit to Denver.\nNash was traded to the Rangers in summer 2012 \u2014 along with Steven Delisle and a third-round draft pick \u2014 for Artem Anisimov, Brandon Dubinsky, Tim Erixon and a 2013 first-round draft pick.\nIn the 2013 and 2014 postseasons, the Rangers played a total of 37 games, but Nash scored only four goals.\nThrough Friday, Nash\u2019s plus-20 rating was the best of his NHL career.\nColorado beat the Rangers 4-3 in a shootout Nov. 13 at New York."}
