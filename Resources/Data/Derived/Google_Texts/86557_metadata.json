And outraged Justice Antonin Scalia blasted the ruling as offering the \u201cmoral weight of a fortune cookie.\u201d\n\nAt first look, there would seem to be no parallels between the statutory language wrangle at the heart of the ACA case (King v. Burwell) and the constitutional showdown in quartet of cases on the legality and recognition of same sex marriage across the nation (Obergefell v. Hodges).\n\nHowever, the clue may be woven into the legal reasoning behind the decision in King v. Burwell in the opinion written by Roberts.\n\nRoberts\u2019 majority opinion seemed to argue a pragmatic concern for the real world impact of a ruling that could have cut off millions of people from access to subsidized health insurance coverage through state exchanges.\n\n\u201cCongress passed the Affordable Care Act to improve health insurance markets, not to destroy them,\u201d Roberts wrote. To dismantle the law by ending the subsidies would \u201cdestabilize the individual insurance market in any state with a federal exchange, and likely create the very \u2018death spirals\u2019 that Congress designed the act to avoid.\u201d\n\nSo how did such pragmatic reasoning play in the gay marriage ruling?\n\nThe justices knew the map of change: 70 percent of Americans live in places where same sex marriage is now legal. Only 13 states banned it.\n\nThey were aware of the polls on gay marriage: six in 10 Americans, a record high number, favor legalization nationwide.\n\nKennedy certainly echoed Solicitor General Donald B. Verrilli Jr.\u2019s argument that:\n\n\u201cIn a world in which gay and lesbian couples live openly as our neighbors, they raise their children side by side with the rest of us, they contribute fully as members of the community . . . it is simply untenable \u2014 untenable \u2014 to suggest that they can be denied the right of equal participation in an institution of marriage, or that they can be required to wait until the majority decides that it is ready to treat gay and lesbian people as equals.\u201d\n\nThose facts-on-the-ground helped point a majority of justice toward a ruling that overturns all remaining state bans while four conservatives took a different approach, a text-based reasoning that looks no further than the Constitution, not to, 21st century facts.\n\nJust a few days ago Emily Bazelon elaborated on pragmatism and formalism in an analysis she wrote for the New York Times Sunday Magazine on how judges make up, or change, their minds:\n\n\u201cThe idea that a judge should consider evidence about a law or a ruling\u2019s effects has been a central tenet of legal thinking since at least the early 20th century. In that period, scholars known as legal realists challenged the opposing conception \u2014 usually called formalism \u2014 that law should logically derive from abstract principles. The realists wanted judging to be grounded pragmatically in evidence about consequences. Today the debate between legal realism and formalism is entangled in politics. Formalists say that realism (or pragmatism, a related concept) is just a cover for a judge to impose his or her own ideological values.\u201d\n\nBazelon speculated that Roberts may be swayed by the pragmatic concerns of cutting off subsidies for millions of people \u2013 neatly foreshadowed the ruling.\n\nAnd Justice Antonin Scalia \u2013 whom she called \u201cthe country\u2019s foremost formalist\u201d in the Sunday paper \u2014 wrote a scathing dissent on the ACA ruling. He called the majority opinion \u201cinterpretive jiggery-pokery.\u201d\n\nIn the June 26, 2013, decision that overturned the Defense of Marriage Act, Scalia, the formalist, wrote a rhetorical question in his dissenting opinion: \u201c[W]hat justification could there possibly be for denying the benefits of marriage to homosexual couples exercising \u2018the liberty protected by the Constitution\u2019?\n\nFriday, in dissenting on gay marriage, his outrage stratospheric. He wrote:\n\n\u201cIf, even as the price to be paid for a fifth vote, I ever joined an opinion for the Court that began: \u2018The Constitution promises liberty to all within its reach, a liberty that includes certain specific rights that allow persons, within a lawful realm, to define and express their identity,\u2019 I would hide my head in a bag. The Supreme Court of the United States has descended from the disciplined legal reasoning of John Marshall and Joseph Story to the mystical aphorisms of the fortune cookie.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s see what happens next. My bet, a bloody battle for national employment and housing non-discrimination laws as newlywed same-sex couples face the prospect of losing their jobs or housing with no federal protection. What facts on the ground will come to the high court then?", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Beliefs, Opinion, Affordable Care Act, Chief Justice John Roberts, contraception, gay marriage, Obamacare, Supreme Court", "generator": "Easy Digital Downloads v2.5.16", "og": {"site_name": "Religion News Service", "description": "The Supreme Court reasoned with concern for the real world impact of dismantling the Affordable Care Act.
