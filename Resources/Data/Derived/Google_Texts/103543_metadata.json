HHS will then notify the insurer for a health plan, or the Department of Labor will notify the third-party administrator for a self-insured plan, that the organization objects to providing contraception coverage. The insurer or third-party administrator is responsible for providing enrollees separate no-cost payments for contraceptive services for as long as they remain in the plan.\n\nAccording to the fact sheet, the obligations of insurers and/or third-party administrators to provide or arrange separate payments for contraceptive services are the same. This takes effect immediately.\n\nHHS is soliciting comments on a proposal also released Aug. 22 for closely held companies, which would allow them to follow the same procedures nonprofits do when their owners object to the contraceptive mandate for religious reasons.\n\nRep. Christopher Smith, R-New Jersey, blasted the new rule in a June 22 statement, calling it \u201creally just another highly coercive regulation \u2014 a direct, obnoxious, unprecedented government attack on the conscience rights of religious entities and anyone else, who for moral reasons, cannot and will not include potentially abortion-causing drugs \u2026 or contraception and sterilization procedures in their private insurance plans.\u201d\n\nThe Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, which represents numerous clients that are suing the government, including Hobby Lobby, issued an Aug. 22 statement calling the new rules the \u201clatest step in the administration\u2019s long retreat on the HHS mandate.\u201d The statement noted that the organization had not yet reviewed the legal aspects of the new rule. As of Aug. 24, the Becket Fund had not released a legal analysis.\n\nArchbishop Joseph E. Kurtz of Louisville, Kentucky, president of the U.S. bishops, also promised to review the interim final regulations and issue an evaluation after the review was completed.\n\n\u201cIn keeping with our practice, we will evaluate the regulations according to the principles set forth in \u2018United for Religious Freedom,'\u201d issued in March 2012, he said in an Aug. 22 statement.\n\nArchbishop Kurtz noted, though, that \u201cby proposing to extend the \u2018accommodation\u2019 to the closely held for-profit employers that were wholly exempted by the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in Hobby Lobby, the proposed regulations would effectively reduce, rather than expand, the scope of religious freedom.\u201d\n\nAs part of the Affordable Care Act, which became law in 2010, HHS requires nearly all employers to cover contraceptives, sterilizations and some abortion-inducing drugs for all employees in company health plans. It includes a narrow exemption for religious employers that fit certain criteria.\n\nEmployers who are not exempt had been required to fill out a self-certification form \u2014 known as EBSA Form 700 \u2014 to direct a third party, usually the manager of an employer\u2019s health plan, to provide the contested coverage.\n\nMany religious employers that have sued over the mandate argue that even filling out Form 700 makes them complicit in providing coverage they find objectionable.\n\nAn HHS statement Aug. 22 said the rules \u201cbalance our commitment to helping ensure women have continued access to coverage for preventative services important to their health, with the administration\u2019s goal of respecting religious beliefs.\u201d\n\n\u2014 By Catholic News Service.
