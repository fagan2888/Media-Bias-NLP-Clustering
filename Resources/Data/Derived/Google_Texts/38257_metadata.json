( Centers for Disease Control )\n\nWomen who were exposed to higher amounts of the pesticide DDT while they were in utero are linked to having a nearly four-fold increased risk of breast cancer decades later than women who were exposed to lower levels prenatally, according to a study led by researchers at Oakland\u2019s Public Health Institute.\n\nThe association was made through analysis of an extraordinary data set of more than 20,000 pregnant women who enrolled in a study between 1959-1967. The women, members of (what was then called) Kaiser Foundation Health Plan in and around Oakland, gave blood samples when they were pregnant or in the days following delivery. Now, decades later, the daughters of those women are reaching an age where breast cancer cases would start to be seen in greater numbers.\n\nBecause of other evidence, researchers had theorized that in utero DDT exposure could increase a woman\u2019s breast cancer risk. Of the 9,000 girls born to mothers in the study, researchers ultimately identified 103 cases of women with breast cancer today. They compared each case against three others who did not have cancer and found higher levels of DDT.\n\n\u201cSizeable Association Compared With Other Risks\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat we found is that women highly exposed in utero had four times the chance of getting diagnosed with breast cancer by the age of 52,\u201d said lead author Barbara Cohn, Ph.D. of the Public Health Institute in an interview. \u201cThis is a sizeable association compared with other risks that we know.\u201d\n\nCohn noted that a four-fold increased risk is 400 percent. Another risk, twice-a-day alcohol consumption, is associated with a 40 percent increased risk. Benign breast disease is associated with a 53 percent increased risk.\n\nThe study was published in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism and was done in conjunction with researchers at UC Davis and the California Department of Toxic Substances Control.\n\nDDT was banned in the U.S. in 1972 and is seen as the issue that launched the modern environmental movement. It was used widely in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\n\u201cIt was nearly a ubiquitous exposure, and the levels were high, not just in California, but worldwide,\u201d Cohn said. \u201cDuring that time most, or nearly most, of all humans of that generation were exposed to DDT.\u201d\n\nIt was used broadly in consumer products including \u201cwallpaper impregnated with DDT to control flies,\u201d Cohn said, as well as bug sprays and sprays on crops.\n\nApparent First\n\nStill, Cohn said more research is needed to confirm this analysis. \u201cThe point of this study is not to be alarmist,\u201d she said.\n\nThe breast cancer risk for a 50-year-old woman of being diagnosed with breast cancer in the next 10 years is 1 in 42, according to the National Cancer Institute.\n\nIn a statement, Elizabeth Ward, Ph.D., and a senior vice president with the American Cancer Society, referred to the \u201cunique resource\u201d the researchers had analyzed and noted that the review of in utero exposure to DDT \u201cappears to be a first.\u201d\n\nStill, Ward added, \u201cUnfortunately, there may be few opportunities to replicate these findings, and because of the small sample size of the study \u2013- with only 103 breast cancer cases \u2014 the results should be interpreted cautiously.\u201d\n\nThe gold standard of clinical research is the randomized control trial, but it\u2019s not possible ethically to give DDT to people, because of its known risks. Instead, Cohn said, the next step would be animal studies to confirm what was seen in humans is also seen in animals.\n\nMany animals go through their life cycles faster than humans, she said. \u201cThose are the studies that would then be able to discover and better address causation and perhaps find the mechanisms for these effects.\u201d That would be the first step toward prevention, Cohn said.\n\nPrevious studies have found that DDT is a hormone disruptor, that it interferes with estrogen\u2019s function. Karuna Jaggar, executive director of Breast Cancer Action, an advocacy group, said this study was an important addition to the body of research that \u201cpoints firmly in the direction\u201d of identifying causes of breast cancer.\n\n\u201cDDT is not the only chemical that acts in this way, and if we are concerned about DDT\u2019s effect on breast cancer, we should be concerned about many other hormone disruptors\u2019 effects on breast cancer,\u201d Jaggar said.\n\nShe specifically mentioned bisphenol A (BPA), used in many plastics, and phthalates, commonly used in beauty products, as examples.\n\nA meta-analysis \u2014 a \u201cstudy of studies\u201d \u2014 in 2014 found no association between DDT exposure and breast cancer risk for women who were directly exposed. But Cohn said it\u2019s likely both are true \u2014 that the critical exposure is in utero, that there is no evidence of risk if exposed later in life.\n\nDDT is still used in other parts of the world, especially in Africa and Asia, to control the spread of malaria. Cohn says she is \u201cnot an anti-DDT person,\u201d but does believe that policymakers should be aware of this potential additional harm of DDT.\n\nMeanwhile, Cohn says that additional research using the 50-year-old samples are underway, including looking at the third generation of women \u2014 age of start of menstruation, for example, as well as a study of the impact of stress on breast cancer risk.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Researchers reviewed blood samples from pregnant women given decades ago.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Oakland Researchers Link Prenatal Exposure to DDT to Higher Breast Cancer Risk Decades Later\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2015\\/06\\/16\\/oakland-researchers-link-prenatal-exposure-to-ddt-to-higher-breast-cancer-risk-decades-later\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-06-16 11:55:51\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-06-16 14:39:20\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":37288,\"author_id\":\"240\",\"author_name\":\"Lisa Aliferis\",\"author_display_name\":\"Lisa Aliferis\",\"tags\":[\"Breast Cancer\",\"Science\"],\"categories\":[\"Community Health\",\"Living Healthy\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2015\\/06\\/Screen-Shot-2015-06-16-at-11.52.20-AM.png\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "Researchers reviewed blood samples from pregnant women given decades ago.", "title": "Oakland Researchers Link Prenatal Exposure to DDT to Higher Breast Cancer Risk Decades Later", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2015/06/16/oakland-researchers-link-prenatal-exposure-to-ddt-to-higher-breast-cancer-risk-decades-later/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2015/06/Screen-Shot-2015-06-16-at-11.52.20-AM.png", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "breast cancer,science", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdad12\"", "article_summary": "The breast cancer risk for a 50-year-old woman of being diagnosed with breast cancer in the next 10 years is 1 in 42, according to the National Cancer Institute.\nBecause of other evidence, researchers had theorized that in utero DDT exposure could increase a woman\u2019s breast cancer risk.\nNow, decades later, the daughters of those women are reaching an age where breast cancer cases would start to be seen in greater numbers.\nA meta-analysis \u2014 a \u201cstudy of studies\u201d \u2014 in 2014 found no association between DDT exposure and breast cancer risk for women who were directly exposed.\nOf the 9,000 girls born to mothers in the study, researchers ultimately identified 103 cases of women with breast cancer today."}
