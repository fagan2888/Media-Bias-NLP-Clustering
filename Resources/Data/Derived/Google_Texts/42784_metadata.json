But years later, much of that money was never directed toward the IT development costs for the exchanges or \u2013 in some cases \u2013 for any specified cost. And yet almost none of it has been returned. So what happened to all that sweet federal cash? That\u2019s the question Fox News is asking today.\n\nAbout $4.6 billion was given to these 17 recipients, including California, New York, Washington state and Kentucky. But the GAO report found that so far, just $1.4 billion of that has been spent on IT projects, and a total of $3 billion has been \u201cspent or drawn down,\u201d though not all the spending is detailed. That, then, leaves at least $1.6 billion unaccounted for. Yet only three states returned any portion of the money \u2013 a total of just over $1 million was given back. \u201c[T]he specific amount spent on marketplace-related projects was uncertain, as only a selected number of states reported to GAO that they tracked or estimated this information,\u201d the report said. Even though states were supposed to set up their marketplaces by the end of last year, they are not yet legally required to return unused funds.\n\nThey highlight a recent American Spectator report which identifies the missing funds which disappeared into the states\u2019 coffers but offers few clues as to where all the money is now.\n\nDavid Catron highlighted the monetary discrepancy and raised the question of whether Democratic officials improperly diverted or spent more than $3 billion in taxpayer grant money. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to know with any degree of certainty where the money went,\u201d he told FoxNews.com. \u201cSo all we know with any confidence is how much was awarded, how much went to IT and what the difference is.\u201d Catron pointed out that 85 percent of federal funds went to Democrat-controlled states, and that only three states returned any money to CMS while the remaining 13 states and D.C. have yet to return any funds.\n\nThere\u2019s a real puzzler for you, eh? 85% of the money went to states with Democrat controlled governments and they either didn\u2019t use it for the intended purpose or it just disappeared. Shocking, I know. But how often do you see federal dollars going anywhere with the recipients turning around and saying, oh, that\u2019s okay. We didn\u2019t need that much. Take the rest back. That\u2019s not how the system works, and frankly I\u2019m not sure if Uncle Sam would know what to do with the cash if anyone actually gave it back. The operation of virtually every department in the federal government is based on a principle of asking for as much money as they can get and then spending every last dime of it before the end of the fiscal year so they can justify asking for more the following year. That was the founding premise of Jim Geraghty\u2019s book, The Weed Agency and it\u2019s even more true in real life than it appears in parody.\n\nBut don\u2019t worry. I\u2019m sure all those states will come up with receipts for where the money went or return the balance any day now. Yes we can, baby.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Let\u2019s not get hung up on the maths", "title": "Billions in Obamacare exchange money remains unaccounted for", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2015/10/26/billions-in-obamacare-exchange-money-remains-unaccounted-for/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@JazzShaw"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-26T12:01:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-26T00:04:22+00:00"}, "keywords": "Budget, ObamaCare, Obamacare exchanges, refund,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd819e\"", "article_summary": "Yet only three states returned any portion of the money \u2013 a total of just over $1 million was given back.\nI\u2019m sure all those states will come up with receipts for where the money went or return the balance any day now.\n85% of the money went to states with Democrat controlled governments and they either didn\u2019t use it for the intended purpose or it just disappeared.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to know with any degree of certainty where the money went,\u201d he told FoxNews.com.\nBillions in Obamacare exchange money remains unaccounted forposted at 8:01 am on October 26, 2015 by Jazz ShawSixteen states (plus the District of Columbia) collected more than $5B to set up Obamacare exchanges after the Affordable Care Act kicked into action."}
