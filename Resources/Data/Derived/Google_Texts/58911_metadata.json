He is a truly genuine friend of the Jewish people.\u201d\n\nIn 2010, then-Congressman Pence revealed his disgust with the way the Obama administration was treating the Jewish State. As reported in The Hill, he told the Christian Broadcasting Network:\n\nI believe the Obama administration is the most anti-Israel administration in the modern history of the state of Israel and our relationship with her. Israel is our most cherished ally. The American people support Israel\u2019s right to self-defense. The American people support the Jewish state of Israel, and the American people expect the American president to unambiguously do the same.\n\nHe added, \u201cI\u2019ll be honest with you: I never thought I\u2019d live to see the day that an American administration would denounce the Jewish state of Israel for rebuilding Jerusalem.\u201d\n\nAccording to the official Indiana government website, Mr. Pence is being accompanied by his wife and three children, along with three members of the Indiana Economic Development Corporation and two members of the governor\u2019s security detail. Private donations and personal funds are covering the cost of the trip, with the exception of the security detail paid for by Indiana taxpayers.\n\nA call and email to the governor\u2019s press secretary went unanswered.\n\nA request for comment via phone and email to the Palestinian ambassador in Washington was also unanswered.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Indiana Governor in Israel, Refuses Abbas Invitation to Dinner", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Indiana Governor in Israel, Refuses Abbas Invitation to Dinner", "title": "Indiana Governor in Israel, Refuses Abbas Invitation to Dinner - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2014/12/Pence-AP.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2014/12/27/indiana-governor-in-israel-refuses-abbas-invitation-to-dinner/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Indiana Governor in Israel, Refuses Abbas Invitation to Dinner", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2014/12/Pence-AP.jpg", "title": "Indiana Governor in Israel, Refuses Abbas Invitation to Dinner - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Breitbart Jerusalem, Hamas, Indiana, Jerusalem, Jews, Mike Pence, Palestine,Breitbart Jerusalem, National Security,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Breitbart Jerusalem", "tag": "Palestine", "published_time": "2014-12-27T09:50:04-07:00", "categories": "National Security,Breitbart Jerusalem"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce282\"", "article_summary": "The American people support the Jewish state of Israel, and the American people expect the American president to unambiguously do the same.\nThe American people support Israel\u2019s right to self-defense.\nHe is a truly genuine friend of the Jewish people.\u201dIn 2010, then-Congressman Pence revealed his disgust with the way the Obama administration was treating the Jewish State.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERRepublican Indiana Governor Mike Pence spent Christmas with his family in Israel, part of a nine-day trip that includes a three-day jobs mission to meet with government and business leaders to discuss expanding economic ties between Indiana and the Jewish State.\nPence\u2019s support for Israel is not new."}
