Bloomberg News\n\nHANOI\u2014In early May, a number of dissident, pro-democracy bloggers in Vietnam received a round of unexpected calls from a former top police official.\n\nThe bloggers were planning demonstrations on May 11 to protest China\u2019s placement of an oil rig in waters claimed by Vietnam. Normally, Vietnamese officials quash such protests. This time the government would let the protests proceed, the former police general said, according to Nguyen Van Dai, a protest organizer who spent four years in prison for his pro-democracy views.\n\nWSJ Frontiers Newsletter Enter your email to be notified when we launch the new WSJ Frontiers weekly email newsletter\n\nThe events that followed provide a cautionary tale for investors who equated Vietnam\u2019s authoritarian rule with a stable manufacturing environment and low risk.\n\nThe initial peaceful demonstrations, organized in four cities by the activists, were rapidly followed by waves of riots in three provinces that targeted the country\u2019s crucial manufacturing centers. Five people were killed and hundreds of factories owned by Chinese and other foreign companies were looted and torched.\n\nThe Vietnamese government didn\u2019t respond to repeated requests for comment on whether it communicated to demonstrators via the former police official, or why they allowed the first protests on May 11 to proceed.\n\nAlthough the initial spark for the protests was China\u2019s oil rig, a month-long Wall Street Journal investigation into the causes of the subsequent violence, involving interviews with more than 40 activists, workers, foreign factory managers and government officials, showed that anti-Chinese sentiment combined with a host of other grievances in a potent and explosive mix.\n\nThe riots were a shock in a country manufacturers have viewed as a stable, attractive alternative to China. Wages in Vietnam are less than half those in China and among the cheapest in Southeast Asia. Vietnam\u2019s government has been more aggressive in offering incentives to foreign investors than the Philippines and Indonesia, and the country is considered more politically stable than neighbors like Thailand, which has been beset by coups in recent years, said HSBC economist Trinh Nguyen.\n\nFlareup\n\nChina\u2019s placing an oil rig in waters claimed by Vietnam last month triggered deadly riots in the Southeast Asian nation. The violence has died down, but repercussions continue.\n\nVietnam now attracts more money relative to the size of its economy than any other Southeast Asian country besides Singapore; foreign investment pledges jumped to $22.34 billion last year from $16.3 billion in 2012.\n\nThe violence was especially troubling for many foreign factory managers since the attacks seemed to come out of the blue. \u201cThe workers have always been peaceful before, even when they held strikes,\u201d said Saigon Daryar Plastics Co. Chief Executive Johnason Chang, who lost $4 million in a factory fire overnight.\n\nIn the cities, activist groups used the peaceful protests to champion causes ranging from release of political prisoners to complaints about confiscation of land by officials.\n\nIn the provinces, rioters shouted nationalist slogans along with calls to end worker exploitation, according to onlookers and Vietnamese officials. Some in the crowd just seemed interested in looting, witnesses said.\n\nA month later, the Vietnamese government has slammed the lid back on public dissent and has begun to send some offenders to prison. Authorities have rounded up more than 1,600 alleged rioters and held a handful of highly publicized trials. Police have tracked down some of the stolen goods and returned them, and the government is working to reassure rattled foreign investors.\n\nTaiwanese companies, the hardest hit, are watching what compensation the Vietnam government will offer before they decide future investment plans, says Yu-Ping Lien, director general of the Investment Development Department of Taiwan\u2019s Ministry of Economic Affairs. Most foreign firms say they\u2019re staying, due to the high cost of relocation and the government\u2019s assurance there wouldn\u2019t be a repeat.\n\nYet the sudden, violent blowup\u2014which took both government officials and the initial protest organizers by surprise\u2014suggests deep resentments are still bottled up beneath the apparent calm.\n\nVisit wsj.com to read the full story.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "The Wall Street Journal's Eva Dou and Richard Paddock unearth the story behind the shocking explosion of violence in Vietnam following China's placement of an oil rig in waters claimed by Vietnam.", "title": "Behind Vietnam\u2019s Anti-China Riots, a Tinderbox of Wider Grievances", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/frontiers/2014/06/18/behind-vietnams-anti-china-riots-a-tinderbox-of-wider-grievances/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-DH483_0618vi_P_20140617215745.jpg"}, "site": "frontiermarkets", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "Behind Vietnam\u2019s Anti-China Riots, a Tinderbox of Wider Grievances", "description": "The Wall Street Journal's Eva Dou and Richard Paddock unearth the story behind the shocking explosion of violence in Vietnam following China's placement of an oil rig in waters claimed by Vietnam.", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Eva Dou and Richard C.
