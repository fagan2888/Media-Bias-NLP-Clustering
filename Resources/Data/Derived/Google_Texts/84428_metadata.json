Will my child get along with the other kids? Is it bad for my child? At least one of these stressors is unnecessary, according to a new study on the effects of daycare on child behavior.\n\nResearch that tracked almost 1,000 Norwegian children through daycare found that the amount of time children spent in daycare had little effect on aggressive behavior.\n\n\u201cFrom a public perspective, our findings are important because they should help ease parents\u2019 fears about the potential harms of early non-parental child care,\u201d said Eric Dearing, lead author on the study and a psychological scientist at the Lynch School of Education, Boston College in a press release.\n\nWomen began entering the workforce in greater numbers in the 1980s, and many more children went to daycare as a result. Some child development researchers began to report that daycare had harmful influences on a child\u2019s social and emotional adjustment. Debate among researchers sprang up, and parents were left uncertain and worried.\n\n\u201cThree decades of follow-up studies have only further fueled this debate,\u201d Dearing explained. \u201cWhile some studies indicate that beginning care early in life and attending for long hours leads to high levels of behavior problems, such as elevated aggression, other studies indicate no risk associated with child care.\u201d\n\nDearing and colleagues thought that the Norwegian child care practices allowed for a unique opportunity to address the controversy empirically.\n\nMost parents in Norway have up to a year of leave, so children rarely begin daycare before they are 9 months old. Children then end up entering child care at different ages depending on when they were born \u2014 enrollment for publicly funded childcare begins in August. The researchers used this as a natural randomizer, since the child\u2019s birth month, rather than a parent\u2019s preferences, determined when they would enter daycare.\n\nTrained assistants interviewed the parents of 939 children about the time spent in daycare at different ages: 6 months and 1,2,3, and 4 years old. The daycare teacher also reported on aggressive behaviors including hitting, pushing, and biting.\n\n\u201cOne surprising finding was that the longer children were in non-parental care, the smaller the effects on aggression became,\u201d Dearing explained.\n\nAt age 2, children who had entered daycare at earlier ages showed slightly elevated levels of aggression than their peers who entered later. These differences, however, diminished over time \u2014 regardless of how much time the child had spent in childcare.\n\n\u201cAt age 2, there was some evidence of small effects of early, extensive, and continuous care on aggression,\u201d Dearing says. \u201cYet, by age 4 \u2014 when these children had been in child care for 2 additional years \u2014 there were no measurable effects of child care in any of our statistical models. This is the opposite of what one would expect if continuous care was risky for young children.\u201d\n\nThe researchers, with the evidence that early child care is not associated with aggressive behavior, are turning their attention to the potential positive effects that childcare could have on children\u2019s learning and language development.\n\nSource: Dearing E, Daae Zachrisson H, Naerde A.
