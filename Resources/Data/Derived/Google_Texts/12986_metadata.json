He noted that he was in New York City last week for a fundraiser that netted $1 million for his campaign.\n\nHe also revealed that he now had about 100 full-time staffers, most of whom, he said, are conducting voter contact. And he mentioned his upcoming swing through Iowa, a three-day bus tour with seven events across the state.\n\n\u201cYou don't accomplish all that without a very good organization,\u201d he said.\n\nThe conference call came at the end of the fourth fundraising quarter and had been scheduled to give donors a year-end update on the state of the campaign. Rubio, who spent the early part of the week campaigning in New Hampshire, fielded questions on a variety of topics in addition to the media narrative about his supposedly lackadaisical campaign.\n\nThe senator also told donors that he intended to keep up his criticisms of rival Ted Cruz, with whom he has been sparring recently over national security and immigration. Rubio, who has cast Cruz as not quite as ardent a foe of legalization as he says, said he would continue to portray the Texas senator as politically inconsistent.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The Florida senator outlined his campaign trail activity and pushed back on the recent media narrative that he\u2019s running a passive campaign, according to two participants on the call.", "title": "Rubio reassures nervous donors his strategy is on track", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/12/marco-rubio-reassures-donors-strategy-217121", "image": "http://static.politico.com/b3/25/c4be8d504a1bb9fd7cfcb42c2bbc/gettyimages-151014793.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "The Florida senator outlined his campaign trail activity and pushed back on the recent media narrative that he\u2019s running a passive campaign, according to two participants on the call.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Getty Rubio reassures nervous donors his strategy is on trackMarco Rubio is seeking to reassure donors amid mounting questions about his campaign schedule and political organization.\nRubio went on to detail his recent schedule, pointing out that over the past week he had visited all four early states.\n\u201cI'm amused at those stories,\u201d Rubio said, according to notes provided by one of the participant.\nThe senator also told donors that he intended to keep up his criticisms of rival Ted Cruz, with whom he has been sparring recently over national security and immigration.\nHe noted that he was in New York City last week for a fundraiser that netted $1 million for his campaign."}
