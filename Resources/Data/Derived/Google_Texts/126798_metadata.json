However, many others likely remain confused about their options under health reform, particularly as Obamacare continues to get caught in the political crossfire. In order to bridge the education gap about the health law, advocates are ramping up their enrollment efforts in creative ways. For instance, you can now text ENROLL to Planned Parenthood to receive information about health reform.\n\nBut nonprofit and government groups can\u2019t do it all on their own. Here are seven large companies that are currently joining in on the effort and helping to spread the word about the new insurance options available under Obamacare:\n\n1. Trader Joe\u2019s\n\nLast month, Trader Joe\u2019s announced that it was dropping coverage for its part-time employees working less than 30 hours a week \u2014 a move that Obamacare critics were quick to interpret as a sign that the health reform law puts too much of a burden on big companies. But the grocery chain actually decided to eliminate part-time benefits because the options under Obamacare are more generous than the plans the company had been offering. And now, it\u2019s encouraging part-time employees to sign up for a plan on Obamacare\u2019s newly-open insurance marketplaces. An internal memo provided to the Huffington Post last week encourages workers to figure out what a plan under Obamacare would cost for them, and suggests that Trader Joe\u2019s may help offset the cost even further by covering part of that premium.\n\n2. TurboTax\n\nCREDIT: TurboTax\n\nTurboTax, one of the most popular tax preparation software packages in the country, is helping to spread the news about what Obamacare\u2019s new insurance marketplaces may mean for their customers\u2019 finances. The front page of its website currently displays a section about \u201chow the new health reform law affects you,\u201d and directs people to get more information about the federal subsidies available to help them buy insurance. Last week, TurboTax sent an email to its customers entitled \u201cHealth Care Reform & Your Taxes\u201d that includes a link to TurboTax\u2019s \u201cHealth Care Eligibility Calculator,\u201d which helps people figure out what their subsidy will be if they want to enroll in one of Obamacare\u2019s new plans.\n\n3. CVS\n\nCREDIT: CVS\n\nIt makes sense that pharmacies would be invested in promoting big changes in the health insurance industry. \u201cFamilies throughout our country look to their pharmacy as a place they can go to for honest, straightforward advice they can trust,\u201d HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius noted in a blog post last month. That\u2019s exactly why CVS officials are promoting Obamacare in 7,400 of their U.S. stores to teach uninsured Americans more about their options for getting coverage. The pharmacy chain will also invite \u201cnavigators,\u201d the employees trained to help Americans enroll in Obamacare plans, into their stores to connect with people who need insurance. And CVS is currently prominently displaying brochures entitled \u201cAffordable Care Act Answers\u201d that answer common questions about health reform.\n\n4. Walgreens\n\nCREDIT: Walgreens\n\nIn July, Walgreens announced that it would partner with Blue Cross Blue Shield, one of the largest health insurance companies in the country, to promote Obamacare. The two companies launched a new website to answer customers\u2019 questions about the health reform law. Walgreens will also have informational materials about health reform available in each of its 8,000 stores.\n\n5. Rite Aid\n\nCREDIT: Rite Aid\n\nLast month, Rite Aid became the third large pharmacy chain to agree to publicize the changes under the health reform law. The company is hosting licensed insurance agents, who are available to help people sign up for Obamacare at no additional cost to them, at 2,000 of its stores across the country. It\u2019s not necessary to make an appointment to meet with the agents, who have received \u201cspecific training\u201d to offer guidance on Obamacare. They\u2019ll be able to answer questions about Obamacare\u2019s insurance marketplaces as well as Medicaid eligibility in the states that have opted to expand the program.\n\n6. WebMD\n\nCREDIT: WebMD\n\nWebMD, the largest online health website in the country, released a consumer guide to Obamacare in August. \u201cWebMD has more than a decade of expertise in providing health insurance information. The Health Care Reform Center builds on this expertise at a time when there is an immense need for trusted, objective information about complex legislation,\u201d the company\u2019s interim CEO David Schlanger explained at the time. Now, on the front page of its site, WebMD is prominently displaying a widget that gives Americans more information about the health reform options in their state. \u201cLearn about plans, benefits, and costs in your state\u2019s Marketplace,\u201d the site notes.\n\n7. Giant Food\n\nCREDIT: Dan Gleiter/The Patriot-News\n\nGiant has partnered with Maryland\u2019s state-run insurance marketplace, Maryland Health Connection, to help spread the word about Obamacare. The grocery chain is displaying information about the plans on the state\u2019s new marketplace in 100 of its stores. The company will also work with Maryland Health Connection to plan outreach events, like enrollment fairs to help Giant customers sign up for Obamacare plans with the help of a navigator. Maryland has been particularly creative about promoting Obamacare, and is also partnering with the Baltimore Ravens to publicize health reform.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Now that Obamacare's new insurance marketplaces are open to the public, here's how some big for-profit companies are helping encourage people to sign up.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Now that Obamacare's new insurance marketplaces are open to the public, here's how some big for-profit companies are helping encourage people to sign up.", "title": "Seven Big Companies Working To Help Americans Sign Up For Obamacare", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2013/10/07/2740621/big-companies-promote-obamacare/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/get-ready-to-get-covered.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Now that Obamacare's new insurance marketplaces are open to the public, here's how some big for-profit companies are helping encourage people to sign up.", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/get-ready-to-get-covered-321x214.jpg", "title": "Seven Big Companies Working To Help Americans Sign Up For Obamacare", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/get-ready-to-get-covered.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/get-ready-to-get-covered.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2013-10-07T11:01:40+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Health Seven Big Companies Working To Help Americans Sign Up For Obamacare CREDIT: ReutersNow that Obamacare\u2019s new insurance marketplaces are open to the public, some uninsured Americans are eager to sign up.\nHere are seven large companies that are currently joining in on the effort and helping to spread the word about the new insurance options available under Obamacare:1.\nCVSCREDIT: CVSIt makes sense that pharmacies would be invested in promoting big changes in the health insurance industry.\nThe two companies launched a new website to answer customers\u2019 questions about the health reform law.\nMaryland has been particularly creative about promoting Obamacare, and is also partnering with the Baltimore Ravens to publicize health reform."}
