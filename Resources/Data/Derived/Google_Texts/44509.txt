NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) - Country music singer Jim Ed Brown will be honored and remembered during a public funeral at the “mother church of country music,” the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville.

A news release from the Grand Ole Opry’s public relations firm said doors will open at 9:30 a.m. Monday with the funeral set for 10 a.m. Interment at Woodlawn will follow the funeral, and is also open to the public.

Brown died of cancer Thursday in Franklin, Tennessee. He was 81.

Brown began singing with the Grand Ole Opry in 1963, when it was still based at the Ryman.

Visitation over the weekend is private for family and close friends. Brown is survived by his wife, Becky, two children and five grandchildren.
