A local hero was honored this weekend at 93 years old for his extraordinary service to our country. The Louisville-Winston County Airport dedicated its new terminal building to Web Pruitt Lee, a man who served with bravery and honor through World War II.

"He was a proud member of the mighty 8th - what most would believe is the greatest air armada in our history," Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves says. "At it's peak, the 8th Air Force could send more than 2,000 4-engine bombers and 1,000 fighters on a single mission over Nazi-occupied Europe."

Lee co-piloted a B-17. After 28 successful missions, Lee and his crew were hit by heavy anti-aircraft fire over Germany, his plane, named the "Badger Beauty," was critically injured, but survived a crash landing in Allied territory. During the ceremony to honor his dedication, Lee said those who served alongside him were foremost on his mind.

"When I drove up, saw my name on that building, I said everybody that flew on these missions, they ought to be on there, too," Lee says.

Although the airport board chose to single out Lee on this day, the board's hope is to honor all Winston County and Mississippi veterans.

"You know that generation never really wants you to say thank you, because they'll always say I just did my job. I just did my duty," Congressman Gregg Harper says.

Lee says he's beyond thankful for this dedication, and trying to express his gratitude, he couldn't help but get choked up.

"Anybody may wonder how many blessings that I have, I tell them just look up at the stars," Lee explains. "If you can count the stars, that's how many blessings I've had."
