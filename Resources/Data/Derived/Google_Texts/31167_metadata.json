Brian Farnan, a member of the student government, sent the gif as part of a weekly e-mail in October about midterm frustrations, and got hit with an \u201cequity complaint\u201d for racial insensitivity. One of the remedies for such a complaint, as the university\u2019s newspaper reports, is a public apology, which is what Farnan did, leading to widespread criticism that\u2019s causing the university to say it\u2019s reviewing its equity policies, which stress confidentiality for the accuser. Legal Insurrection picks up the apology via Facebook:\n\nOppression, as outlined in SSMU\u2019s Equity Policy, means the exercise of power by a group of people over another group of people with specific consideration of cultural, historical and living legacies. The image in question was an extension of the cultural, historical and living legacy surrounding people of color\u2014particularly young men\u2014being portrayed as violent in contemporary culture and media. By using this particular image of President Obama, I unknowingly perpetuated this living legacy and subsequently allowed a medium of SSMU\u2019s communication to become the site of a microaggression; for this, I am deeply sorry.\u201d\n\nSetting aside for a moment the transparent use of a term like \u201cmicroaggression\u201d to impose onerous restrictions on speech, the public apology is completely oblivious to President Obama\u2019s actual aggressions, such as the kill list drone program, which may have killed more than a thousand civilians alone, using kill lists and policies that actually consider any military-age males (young men of color!) in a target zone as \u201cmilitants,\u201d including, for example, the 16-year-old American son of Anwar al-Awlaki killed in a US drone strike. Obama certainly has a \u201cliving legacy\u201d of violence, one that\u2019s an extension of the historical legacy of violent US foreign policies prosecuted by American presidents, not just Bush\u2019s but nearly all of the 42 presidents that preceded Obama, something you probably didn\u2019t hear trumpeted on President\u2019s Day.\n\nThe policy that produced such a tone-deaf apology is also a an extension, a natural product of a country with particularly heavy restrictions on free speech for a democracy. Last year, for example, Ontario\u2019s human rights tribunal dismissed a complaint against the heteronormativity of A&W\u2019s \u201cBurger Family\u201d not because it\u2019s problematic for a government to be involved in accepting or acting on such complaints, but because it was filed by a man posing as a \u201cradical lesbian feminist.\u201d Stephen Harper, now Canada\u2019s prime minister, once called Canada\u2019s system of speech-restricting human rights tribunals \u201ctotalitarian.\u201d As prime minister, however, he admits that there\u2019s a problem but also that he has no idea what the solution should be. Maclean\u2019s suggested repealing Section 13 of the Canadian Human Rights Act*, which deals with material that could \u201cexpose a person or persons to hatred\u201d by creating a \u201cconciliatory\u201d system exempt from due process that nevertheless levies fines and penalties. Depressingly for Canadians interested in free speech, repeal even of that section would still leave has left a bevy of other laws on the book that regulate and restrict speech north of the border.\n\n*UPDATE: Section 13 was actually repealed last year.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "McGill University considering revising policy that led to public apology", "title": "Student Apology About \u201cLiving Legacy\u201d Surrounding Gif of Obama Kicking Down Door Totally Oblivious To Legacy of Presidents\u2019 Violent Foreign Policies", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2014/02/18/student-apology-about-living-legacy-surr", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/13927443223806.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Last month, a student at\nCanada\u2019s McGill University was compelled to apologize for sharing a\nfairly recognizable gif of President Obama kicking down the door\nafter a White House press conference that originated from a video\nbit on the Tonight Show.
