The Supreme Court is saying no to calls for the speedy release of the audio of Wednesday's high-stakes argument about tax subsidies that are critical to President Barack Obama's health overhaul.

Court spokeswoman Kathy Arberg offered no explanation Monday in saying the justices have rejected requests from The Associated Press, C-SPAN and others to have the audio posted online shortly after the argument concludes on Wednesday.

The court made available same-day audio in the first health overhaul case in 2012 and in the gay marriage cases in 2013. It generally posts argument audio on its website on the Friday after a case is heard.

Arberg said the court has yet to decide about early release of audio for this term's gay marriage cases, scheduled for the last week in April.
