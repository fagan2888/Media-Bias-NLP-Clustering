Traditionally, February has always been a slow insurance month, so the lack of activity in rates is not surprising.\u201d\n\nBy coverage classification, business interruption, inland marine and commercial auto were priced more competitively in February as compared to January. The rates for other coverages remained steady.\n\nSCROLL DOWN FOR GRAPHS\n\nLarge and jumbo accounts were also down more in February, with large ($250,001 to $1,000,000) down from -4% in January 2016, to -5% in February 2016. Jumbo accounts (over $1,000,000), were down from -3% to -4% in the same period. All other account sizes matched the same composite rate from the prior month.\n\nBy industry classification, manufacturing had a significant rate decrease from -2% in January, to -5% in February. Habitational was down another 1% in February for a total of -6%. All other industry rates remained the same as in January.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Commercial property and casualty rates in the U.S. were largely unchanged in February as compared to the prior month, according to MarketScout.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.1", "og": {"site_name": "IFAwebnews.com", "description": "Commercial property and casualty rates in the U.S. were largely unchanged in February as compared to the prior month, according to MarketScout.", "title": "Low volume keeps commercial insurance rates steady in February", "url": "http://ifawebnews.com/2016/03/14/low-volume-keeps-commercial-insurance-rates-steady-in-february/", "image": {"width": 452, "identifier": "http://ifawebnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Barometer_Commercial_Feb-2016.jpg", "height": 731}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://ifawebnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Barometer_Commercial_Feb-2016.jpg?w=640", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-14T16:33:46+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-14T16:34:44+00:00"}, "verify-v1": "Fve8IDDdj94aX4Ar18+v33qGgAesGnY2YiqbnR5P17I="}, "article_summary": "All other industry rates remained the same as in January.\nCommercial property and casualty rates in the U.S. were largely unchanged in February as compared to the prior month, according to MarketScout.\nAll other account sizes matched the same composite rate from the prior month.\nTraditionally, February has always been a slow insurance month, so the lack of activity in rates is not surprising.\u201dBy coverage classification, business interruption, inland marine and commercial auto were priced more competitively in February as compared to January.\nThe composite rate remains at -4%, according to the Dallas-based insurance distribution and underwriting company."}
