There are never enough bureaucratic controls or government programs to \u201cincentivize\u201d us\u2014in the jargon\u2014to behave in ways the technocrats think best.\n\nThat is why we should look with a jaundiced eye at new legislation that would pay Medicare beneficiaries for preparing an advance medical directive. The Medicare Choices Empowerment and Protection Act is founded on the belief of its authors\u2014senators Chris Coons (D-Del.) and Bill Cassidy (R-La.) along with representatives Diane Black (R-Tenn.) and Mike Thompson (D-Calif.)\u2014that we are not doing a good job accomplishing what the government wants us to do. The legislators\u2019 press release claims that 70 percent of us have \u201cthought about\u201d end-of-life care but \u201conly\u201d 30 percent have actually prepared written advance directives that would give instructions if we become incapacitated\u2014and so an inducement is needed.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with filling out an advance directive, of course. To the contrary, it is an important task given the evolving economics of medicine, and especially so if one wants expensive life-extending care. But once the government sticks its ever-growing nose into private, individual decisions, they rarely stay private or remain individualized. Hence, the 22-page bill would not just encourage the creation of advance directives. It would also make it easier to federalize the entire sector in coming years.\n\nFirst, the bill would grant Medicare beneficiaries a onetime benefit of $75 (indexed to inflation) to prepare an advance directive. The wisdom of having the government pay us to take care of our own business is questionable. But this being federal legislation, not just any advance directive will do. In order to qualify for the payment, the directive will have to be \u201ccertified\u201d by the federal government and \u201cexecuted in accordance\u201d with the law of the state in which the beneficiary lives, not a federal standard. Okay. But here\u2019s the kicker: To be federally certified the advance directive must be \u201coffered by an entity that has received accreditation from the Secretary\u201d of health and human services.\n\nAs with everything governmental, official accreditation favors large, institutional suppliers. To be accredited, vendors would have to meet extensive computer and online technical capabilities, including:\n\nthe facility to \u201ccreate, adopt, modify, and terminate an advance directive through an online process.\u201d\n\n\u201ccomply with an annual quality review to be conducted by\n\nthe Secretary.\u201d\n\nthe Secretary.\u201d the capacity to provide the state statutory or alternative advance directive forms that comply with the particular laws of each state in which the vendor offers advance directives.\n\nthe ability to allow \u201cany family member, legal representative, or health care proxy . . . near real-time online access to the beneficiary\u2019s advance directive,\u201d as well as access to \u201cproviders of services and suppliers\u201d\n\nunder Medicare.\n\nunder Medicare. \u201ccomply with the Federal regulations (concerning the privacy of individually identifiable health information),\u201d which is a very complex field of federal civil and criminal law.\n\nthe capacity to successfully pass \u201crigorous independent testing regarding standards of timeliness, accuracy, and efficiency\u201d and \u201creal-time tests simulating a realistic volume of beneficiaries and providers accessing advance directives simultaneously.\u201d\n\nthe willingness and capacity to administer detailed \u201cannual beneficiary surveys\u201d for submission to\n\nthe government.\n\nThat kind of technical know-how and capability will require the business or organization seeking accreditation to maintain a significant computer infrastructure supported by extensive IT capacities and security protocols to guard against hacking. (Good luck with that!) In a nutshell, this is how government favors large institutions over small, while continuing to expand its own regulatory intrusions.\n\nOnce a group received accreditation, it would be expected to maintain executed ADs for online retrieval by patient, surrogate, family, and/or health care providers, as, and wherever, needed. (Apparently, the authors are unaware of an invention known as \u201cscanners,\u201d that can copy and email documents anywhere in the world.) The government will also maintain a clearinghouse to each state\u2019s certified AD suppliers, with links, but will not be authorized to store the documents in a federal database.\n\nThe intent behind the Medicare Choices Empowerment and Protection Act is obviously not to empower \u201cdeath panels.\u201d No one would be forced to fill out an advance directive, and noncertified directives could still be crafted, as they are now. The bill would also require that the Medicare and You handbook and the HHS website contain a statement advising consumers, \u201cYou should not feel pressured to violate your own values and preferences, and you are entitled to implement them without discrimination based on age or degree of disability.\u201d Of course, such a statement should be in the booklet anyway.\n\nMoreover, because vendor accreditation would be based solely on technical standards\u2014as opposed to moral views\u2014right to life groups with the capacity to develop the required systems could just as readily become accredited as right to die organizations or businesses pushing the forms. Indeed, the National Right to Life Committee\u2019s Burke Balch\u2014an unequivocal opponent of medical utilitarianism\u2014supports the bill as a potential prophylactic against the vulnerable being pressured during end-of-life doctor/patient conferences into refusing expensive treatments, by ensuring that Medicare beneficiaries have wider exposure to\u2014and information about\u2014advance directives that make it easy to request care.\n\nBut here\u2019s the problem: Once the federal government gets into the advance directive \u201ccertification\u201d and \u201caccreditation\u201d business, a Rubicon will have been crossed. It is not in the nature of government to remain a neutral arbiter. Given bureaucracy\u2019s natural intrusiveness, the bill would, over time, almost certainly result in increased federal influence over the content of our end-of-life choices.\n\nProtecting America\u2019s weakest and most vulnerable patients from being deflected from requesting expensive care is important. But the best protection against that danger is less\u2014not more\u2014centralization. Enlarging the federal bureaucracy\u2019s role in end-of-life choices will ultimately empower the federal bureaucracy\u2019s control over end-of-life care.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Government,Medicaid,Medicare,Obamacare,Wesley J.
