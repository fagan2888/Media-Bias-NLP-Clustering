In this book he argues that science is the real basis for morality. Science doesn\u2019t merely describe \u201cwhat is\u201d; it also tells humans \u201cwhat ought to be.\u201d Using scientific empiricism, we can objectively determine right from wrong. If a science of human flourishing informs morality, then humanity has no use for gods and religion.\n\nHis arguments have been attacked, but Harris claims that he hasn\u2019t encountered \u201ca substantial criticism\u201d (a somewhat subjective phrase for such an objective fellow). But he\u2019s willing to be swayed if someone comes up with something \u201csubstantial,\u201d and he\u2019s putting his money where his mouth is. Here\u2019s his announcement on his blog .\n\n\n\nSo I would like to issue a public challenge. Anyone who believes that my case for a scientific understanding of morality is mistaken is invited to prove it in 1,000 words or less. (You must refute the central argument of the book\u0097not peripheral issues.) The best response will be published on this website, and its author will receive $1,000. If any essay actually persuades me, however, its author will receive $10,000, and I will publicly recant my view.\n\nHow generous and open minded of him. There\u2019s nothing like the promise of cold, hard cash for promoting thoughtful moral reflection.\n\nCall me a cynic, but I have my doubts that Harris offers this challenge in good faith. If he\u2019s not really interested in changing his mind, then why offer the money? Here are my speculations regarding his $1,000 bounty.\n\nFirst, it\u2019s been three years since the book came out. By offering a prize for the best refutation, Harris will convince thousands of arm-chair apologists to buy his book and write their own critique. He\u2019s going to make more money off this contest than he\u2019ll pay out to a winner.\n\nSecond, Harris will get thousands of brief essays arguing for a religiously grounded morality. His research assistants can then comb through them, and these essays will end up being the basis for his next book. It will be entitled something like The Dumb Things Apologists Say . If you enter, he can use your name and essay however he sees fit.

This is a stunt. Unfortunately, it\u2019s a stunt that will probably make him lots of money.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A blog devoted to sharing initial thoughts on topics, and daily ramblings, First Thoughts speaks to the latest topics in religion and today\u2019s society.", "og": {"site_name": "First Things", "description": "One of the \u201chorsemen\u201d of the \u201cnew atheism\u201d has invited his opponents to . . . .", "title": "Win Sam Harris\u2019s Money (and make him richer in the process) | Collin Garbarino", "url": "http://www.firstthings.com/blogs/firstthoughts/2013/09/win-sam-harriss-money-and-make-him-richer-in-the-process", "image": "https://dae6ca3yfi9zj.cloudfront.net/img/feature-default.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@firstthingsmag", "image": "https://dae6ca3yfi9zj.cloudfront.net/img/feature-default.png", "description": "One of the \u201chorsemen\u201d of the \u201cnew atheism\u201d has invited his opponents to . . . .", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Win Sam Harris\u2019s Money (and make him richer in the process) | Collin Garbarino"}, "robots": "follow", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"admins": 1504860014}, "msvalidate.01": "649D2BEB6B8F0C1832C0762CD37C2FAE", "thumbnail": "https://dae6ca3yfi9zj.cloudfront.net/img/favicon-196.png", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd89d5\"", "article_summary": "But he\u2019s willing to be swayed if someone comes up with something \u201csubstantial,\u201d and he\u2019s putting his money where his mouth is.\nOne of the \u201chorsemen\u201d of the \u201cnew atheism\u201d has invited his opponents to enter the lists, and he\u2019s willing to pay the champion.\nSam Harris isn\u2019t interested in furthering our understanding of the moral framework.\nHe\u2019s going to make more money off this contest than he\u2019ll pay out to a winner.\nIf a science of human flourishing informs morality, then humanity has no use for gods and religion."}
