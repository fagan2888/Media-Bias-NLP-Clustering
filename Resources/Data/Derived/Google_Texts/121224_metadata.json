A group of people who had worked on the technology for the president's campaign came in to address the broken site, working through Thanksgiving up to Christmas Eve.\n\n\n\n\"These were relatively young, modest people,\" Brill said. \"The hardest part of the reporting was getting them individually to take any kind of responsibility for the good work they did. They kept saying, 'This is a team. We don't want to be written about. We just like to fix things.'\"\n\nBrill writes in his report, \"It is ... a story of an Obama administration obsessed with health care reform policy but above the nitty-gritty of implementing it.\"\n\n\n\nAsked about that piece of reporting, Brill said, \"The people in the White House, at least for this bill, which is what my reporting was about, were very preoccupied by the policy decisions, the regulations they were writing and not preoccupied by, you know, the nitty-gritty of actually implementing it. And government is implementation.\"\n\nBrill added, \"The plumbing and the electricity now works in the house, and now we get to see whether we like living in the house. Now the law will be given a chance to work.\"\n\n\n\nThe new issue of Time magazine goes on newsstands Friday.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Reporter behind magazine&#039;s cover story says administration was &quot;pretty desperate,&quot; staffers used own laptops to see if site was up", "og": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/healthcaregov-rollout-made-obama-administration-pretty-desperate/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/12/25/99749f49-4097-4e51-90ad-299f67032cf7/thumbnail/1200x630/619a8ecf14e0ed66e8715d926f9453b1/AP106902674308.jpg", "height": 630}, "type": "article", "description": "Reporter behind magazine's cover story says administration was \"pretty desperate,\" staffers used own laptops to see if site was up", "title": "HealthCare.gov rollout made Obama administration \"pretty desperate\""}, "twitter": {"description": "Reporter behind magazine's cover story says administration was \"pretty desperate,\" staffers used own laptops to see if site was up", "title": "HealthCare.gov rollout made Obama administration \"pretty desperate\"", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "cbsnewsapp://news/healthcaregov-rollout-made-obama-administration-pretty-desperate/", "iphone": "cbsnewsapp://news/healthcaregov-rollout-made-obama-administration-pretty-desperate/", "googleplay": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/healthcaregov-rollout-made-obama-administration-pretty-desperate/"}, "country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "CBS News", "iphone": "CBS News", "googleplay": "CBS News"}, "id": {"ipad": 334256223, "iphone": 334256223, "googleplay": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}}, "site": "@cbsthismorning", "image": "http://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/12/25/99749f49-4097-4e51-90ad-299f67032cf7/thumbnail/1200x630/619a8ecf14e0ed66e8715d926f9453b1/AP106902674308.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"web": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/healthcaregov-rollout-made-obama-administration-pretty-desperate/"}, "android": {"app_name": "CBS News", "package": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}, "ios": {"url": "cbsnewsapp://news/healthcaregov-rollout-made-obama-administration-pretty-desperate/", "app_name": "CBS News", "app_store_id": 334256223}}, "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"app_id": 1536620209892267}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CBSThisMorning"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2561\"", "article_summary": "President Obama considered shutting down the HealthCare.gov website and starting over during its rollout, Time magazine reports in its new cover story.\nThe administration was \"pretty desperate,\" according to Time contributor Steven Brill, who reported the story.\nBrill writes in his report, \"It is ... a story of an Obama administration obsessed with health care reform policy but above the nitty-gritty of implementing it.\"\nThe president had \"no information\" in the first two weeks after the rollout, Brill said.\nIn addition to reporting the implementation of the health care law, Brill reports on the massive effort to fix the website's issues."}
