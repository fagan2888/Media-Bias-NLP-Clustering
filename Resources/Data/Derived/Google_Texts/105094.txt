A tanker truck hauling jet fuel caught fire Wednesday afternoon and ignited a fast-growing grass blaze, causing lengthy traffic delays on Interstate 25 south of Castle Rock

Officials say the blaze, burning in Greenland, burned about 250 acres. It was 100 percent contained just before 4 p.m., according to the Douglas County Sheriff’s Office.

Right after the early afternoon crash, lanes of the interstate were intermittently closed as crews battled the fire. A photo from the scene, taken by the State Patrol, showed the grass fire creeping up to the roadway’s edge.

Helicopter drops on the fire were halted after firefighters gained an upper hand.

A response crew transferred fuel from the damaged tanker to a replacement tanker. All lanes but one reopened in the area at about 3:30 p.m., according to the sheriff’s office. The final lane reopened about 6:40 p.m.

Authorities had encouraged motorists traveling between Denver and Colorado Springs to seek alternate routes.

The State Patrol said the tanker melted in half. The driver was able to escape unharmed, troopers said.

The Tri-Lake Fire Department in Monument fought the blaze and called in air support. South Metro Fire Rescue Authority assisted Tri-Lake fire with the incident.

“(The) tanker did not roll over, but (it) looks to have had a mechanical failure,” the State Patrol’s Castle Rock office said in a tweet.
