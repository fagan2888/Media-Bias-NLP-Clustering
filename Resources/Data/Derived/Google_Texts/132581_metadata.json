I think it will be one of the first things to go.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s former press secretary\u2019s comments are out of step with his fellow White House colleague\u2014Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, who favors the employer mandate and believes it will remain a fixture of the health care law and have a significant impact on how Americans receive health coverage in the future.\n\nEmanuel, who served as a top adviser to President Obama and chief architect of the Affordable Care Act, told The New York Times that he predicts the employer mandate will prompt more large employers to shift their employees onto the federal and state exchanges. He said by 2025, \u201cfewer than 20 percent of workers in the private sector will receive traditional employer-sponsored health insurance.\u201d\n\nWhen the mandate fully takes effect in 2016, Emanuel predicts that a handful of big \u201cblue-chip companies will announce their intention to stop providing health insurance. Instead, they will raise salaries substantially or offer large, defined contributions to their workers. Then the floodgates will open.\u201d\n\nRelated: Employer-Based Health Plans on Slippery Slope\n\nHowever, Gibbs, and many other opponents of the employer mandate, disagree and point out that many large employers already offer health coverage to their employees without the mandate.\n\nA recently released Gallup poll shows about 44 percent of Americans receive health coverage through their employer. Other studies show that more than 170 million employees, retirees and dependents are insured through employers.\n\nThe mandate has received criticism on both sides of the aisle. Liberal blogger Ezra Klein called the provision \u201cone of the worst ideas in recent memory\u201d in The Washington Post.\n\n\u201cBy tying the penalties to how many full-time workers an employer has, and how many of them qualify for subsidies, the mandate gives employers a reason to have fewer full-time workers, and fewer low-income workers,\u201d Klein wrote.\n\nRelated: Obamacare: Taxpayers in the Hole for $1.5 Trillion\n\nHe cited a 2009 analysis from the Center for Budget and Policy Priories which concluded that the employer mandate would \u201cprovide an incentive for employers to convert full-time workers to part-time workers,\u201d among other issues.\n\nLikewise, Avik Roy of the Conservative Manhattan Institute, called for repealing the mandate, calling it a \u201chuge drag on hiring\u201d in Forbes. \u201cThe mandate increases the cost of hiring someone, become on top of wages you now have to pay for his costly, government-approved insurance plan,\u201d he explained.\n\nHowever, if the employer mandate was repealed, it is unclear how the government would make up the money it is intending to collect from penalties in order to pay for the ACA.\n\n\u201cThe penalties charged to employers that don\u2019t offer affordable coverage are a key source of financing for the law,\u201d Larry Levitt of the Kaiser Family Foundation said. \u201cRepealing the employer requirement would lead to lower federal revenues, higher federal costs for premium subsidies and Medicaid, and probably more people uninsured.\u201d\n\nGibbs said that the law is only in the \u201cfirst inning\u201d of its implementation, and should be improved upon down the road. \u201cWe need to have an honest discussion about improving and tweaking the law,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will be a long time before we know how this will play out. But the law has real potential to work.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "A key provision of Obamacare that was intended to help finance much of the health care", "title": "Top Dem Predicts Employer Mandate Will Be Repealed", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/04/03/Top-Dem-Predicts-Employer-Mandate-Will-Be-Repealed", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/04032014_Robert_Gibbs.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/04/03/Top-Dem-Predicts-Employer-Mandate-Will-Be-Repealed", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/04032014_Robert_Gibbs.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "A key provision of Obamacare that was intended to help finance much of the health care", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "However, if the employer mandate was repealed, it is unclear how the government would make up the money it is intending to collect from penalties in order to pay for the ACA.\nSpeaking at the annual Benefits Selling Expo in Colorado, Gibbs said he expects the employer mandate to be repealed and said doing so would \u201cimprove the law,\u201d BenefitsPro reported.\nGibbs said the employer mandate provision is \u201ca small part of the law.\nA recently released Gallup poll shows about 44 percent of Americans receive health coverage through their employer.\nEzekiel Emanuel, who favors the employer mandate and believes it will remain a fixture of the health care law and have a significant impact on how Americans receive health coverage in the future."}
