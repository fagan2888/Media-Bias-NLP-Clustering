SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (WWLP) – The region’s largest employer is laying off 24 workers, and eliminating 45 open positions as it faces an approximately $22 million budget shortfall. According to a news release sent to 22News by Baystate Health spokesperson Ben Craft, an additional 17 workers will have their hours cut.

Craft says that most of the layoffs are at Baystate Medical Center in Springfield, though doctors and bedside nurses are not among those who are being let go. He added that some of those who have been laid off are in management positions. The people being laid off will leave in 30 days, and are being provided with severance pay and job placement assistance.

Baystate Medical Center Chief Operating Officer Nancy Shendell-Falik said that they feel badly about the layoffs, but that they are necessary.

“Like many healthcare providers, we are facing a need to adjust our human, material, and financial resources to adapt to the rapidly changing healthcare environment,” Shendell-Falik said. “Difficult decisions such as these make it possible for us to continue to invest in services we’re able to provide our patients, whether it’s a new program, a new or renovated facility, surgical supplies, or a CT scanner.”

She said that the reimbursements the hospital receives for treating Medicaid patients is between 70 and 80 cents on the dollar, and that is not enough to recover the cost of care.
