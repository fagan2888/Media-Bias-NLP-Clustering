Peyton Manning is off and running. ... All the way to the Super Bowl. He has his defense to thank.

Cornerback Bradley Roby saved the game by picking off Tom Brady's pass on a 2-point try with 12 seconds left to preserve a 20-18 victory for the Broncos over the Patriots Sunday in the AFC title game.

Denver (14-4) will face Arizona or Carolina for the title on Feb. 7.

New England had to go for 2 after Brady's 4-yard touchdown to Rob Gronkowski because Stephen Gostkowski missed an extra point in the first quarter, snapping a string of 523 straight makes.

Manning threw two touchdowns but the 39-year-old QB's best play may have very well been his 12-yard scramble on third down in the third quarter -- his longest playoff run since he was a rookie.
