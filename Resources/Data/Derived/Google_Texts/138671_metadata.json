China countered that U.S. launched attacks targeted 80 percent of its government websites.\n\nAhead of a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping later this week, Obama promised the two would \u201cspeak directly and candidly, as we always do, about specific actions China can take to help all of us, across the Asia-Pacific, to expand trade and investment, which many of the CEOs I talk to raise in our discussions.\u201d\n\nMajor tech players like Apple and Facebook have tried to make inroads into the Chinese economy, viewed as a large untapped resource for many foreign companies. China, though, places restrictions on foreign companies operating within its borders.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook and Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg last month spent a week traveling around China. Cook met with Chinese officials to discuss differences on data security amid reports China had been hacking Apple iCloud accounts to gain information on pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong.\n\nWhile Apple has been allowed to roll out its new products in China, including the iPhone 6 last month, Facebook is still banned in the country.\n\nOpening China\u2019s economy benefits all APEC countries, Obama said Monday.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t suggest these things because they\u2019re good for us; we suggest that China do these things for the sake of sustainable growth in China, and the stability of the Asia-Pacific region,\u201d Obama said.\n\nCybersecurity experts, though, have not had high expectations that this week\u2019s talks will break new ground on a broad cyber agreement.\n\nChina pulled out of a cyber working group earlier this year after the U.S. indicted five members of the Chinese military for hacking.\n\nThe two countries have continued \u201cquiet discussions\u201d through unofficial channels, but have made little progress, said Chinese cyber policy expert Adam Segal, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\n\u201cThe question is, can they come up with a face-saving way to restart the working group?\u201d he said. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen any configuration of that.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. surveillance programs revealed by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden have also given the Chinese little incentive to budge.\n\n\u201cThe Chinese are pretty happy to just keep hammering away on Snowden,\u201d Segal said.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The two countries have clashed repeatedly over cyberattacks this year.", "description": "The two countries have clashed repeatedly over cyberattacks this year.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Cory Bennett", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The two countries have clashed repeatedly over cyberattacks this year.", "title": "Obama urges China to stop cyber theft", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/223555-obama-urges-china-to-stop-cyber-theft", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-11-10T15:17:35-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2014-11-10T15:17-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/223555-obama-urges-china-to-stop-cyber-theft", "dcterms.date": "2014-11-10T15:12-05:00", "dcterms.creator": "Meghashyam Mali", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Hacking,Obama, Xi Jinping,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-10T15:12:53-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-10T15:17:35-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/223555-obama-urges-china-to-stop-cyber-theft", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The two countries have clashed repeatedly over cyberattacks this year.", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama urges China to stop cyber theft"}, "dcterms.title": "Obama urges China to stop cyber theft"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd5888\"", "article_summary": "President Obama is urging China to stop cyberattacks to steal trade secrets and allow foreign companies to compete equally.\nADVERTISEMENT\u201cWe look to China to become an innovative economy that values the protection of intellectual property rights, and rejects cyber theft of trade secrets for commercial gain,\u201d he added.\nChina, though, places restrictions on foreign companies operating within its borders.\nOpening China\u2019s economy benefits all APEC countries, Obama said Monday.\nChina pulled out of a cyber working group earlier this year after the U.S. indicted five members of the Chinese military for hacking."}
