In Colorado, the company has four independently owned offices along the Front Range.\n\nWe sat down with 2010 University of Colorado grad Chris Greene, owner of a Touching Hearts franchise that serves Boulder, Weld, Larimer and Adams counties, to learn more about the growing business.\n\nYou're 27, and you've been at this for a few years. What motivated you to work in senior care at such a young age?\n\nMy grandfather had Alzheimer's. When he was sick, everyone pitched in, but my aunt was doing the majority of the care giving, and it was hard on her.\n\nThen, I got some literature in the mail (about Touching Hearts) and had the experience with my grandfather in the back of my mind, of how hard it was on the family, and that's where I saw the greatest need.\n\nTouching Hearts is there to relieve that family pressure.\n\nHow is the business going?\n\nWe're booming like crazy. We've already doubled our revenue figures for 2014 at this point, so we are on pace to double last year's revenue.\n\nWith the surge in the amount of services needed, care giver shortages are going to be a problem. It is a problem now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo you're hiring?\n\nWe're always hiring.\n\nWe have 15 care givers in Boulder and Broomfield counties, and we have 15 clients in those areas as well, so right now we're 1-to-1.\n\nWe can only grow as fast as we get care givers.\n\nWho is your typical care giver and what sort of services do they provide?\n\nSome of them are empty nesters. A lot are aspiring nurses. We just look for good people, people that love giving back.\n\nWe provide non-medical home care, so light housekeeping, cooking, driving, running errands. We can be there once a month or 24/7 \u2014 whatever the client needs.\n\nWhat's the most rewarding part of your job?\n\nFilling an incredible need.\n\nWith the surge in the amount of services needed, care giver shortages are going to be a problem. It is a problem.\n\nWhen it comes to Alzheimer's, millions of Americans have it or will get it. My family's story is not one of a kind. And I think that awareness it still not there of just how great a need we have for care givers.\n\nGetting in this business was a great decision. I really like it.\n\nYou can look at the morbid side of death and dying, but the things we hear back from families \u2014 it's those days you kind of live for.\n\nShay Castle: 303-473-1626, castles@dailycamera.com, @shayshinecastle", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-business/ci_28796900/5-questions-chris-greene-franchise-owner-touching-hearts", "sailthru.author": "By Shay Castle \n \n  Staff writer", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:28796900:view"}, "startDate": "2015-09-13T03:57:14-0600", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "Started by the founder of Merry Maids, Touching Hearts at Home is bringing the maid-for-hire model to  home care, providing non-medical services to seniors and the disabled.", "title": "5 questions with Chris Greene, franchise owner of Touching Hearts at Home", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-business/ci_28796900/5-questions-chris-greene-franchise-owner-touching-hearts", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/0911/20150911__13dcbptou~1.jpg", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Boulder County Business", "modificationDate": "2015-09-11T16:00:27-0600", "endDate": "2025-09-11T14:38:03-0600", "news_keywords": "Boulder business news, Boulder Colorado, technology news, real estate, Boulder real estate, boulder business people, breaking business news, boulder, colorado, business, news,", "byline": "By Shay CastleStaff", "pubDate": "2015-09-11T16:02:04-0600", "sailthru.date": "2015-09-13T03:57:14-0600", "sailthru.title": "5 questions with Chris Greene, franchise owner of Touching Hearts at Home", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/0911/20150911__13dcbptou~1_300.jpg", "description": "Started by the founder of Merry Maids, Touching Hearts at Home is bringing the maid-for-hire model to  home care, providing non-medical services to seniors and the disabled.", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-business/ci_28796900/5-questions-chris-greene-franchise-owner-touching-hearts", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "Started by the founder of Merry Maids, Touching Hearts at Home is bringing the maid-for-hire model to  home care, providing non-medical services to seniors and the disabled.", "title": "5 questions with Chris Greene, franchise owner of Touching Hearts at Home"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/0911/20150911__13dcbptou~1.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1b82\"", "article_summary": "We sat down with 2010 University of Colorado grad Chris Greene, owner of a Touching Hearts franchise that serves Boulder, Weld, Larimer and Adams counties, to learn more about the growing business.\nTouching Hearts is there to relieve that family pressure.\nTouching Hearts franchise owners screen and hire care givers, who are then hired by clients for help with tasks such as grocery shopping and transport to doctor appointments.\nWith the surge in the amount of services needed, care giver shortages are going to be a problem.\nWho is your typical care giver and what sort of services do they provide?"}
