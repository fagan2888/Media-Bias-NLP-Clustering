That lousy credit score is costing you more than a good rate on a loan.

Insurance premiums for homeowners with excellent credit are half the price of premiums for homeowners with poor credit, according to a new report by insuranceQuotes.com. Homeowners with median credit pay about a third more than those with excellent credit.

The difference in premiums varies by state, with homeowners with poor credit in 38 states paying at least twice as much those with excellent credit. Homeowners in West Virginia have the biggest premium gap, with those with poor credit paying more than three times what homeowners with excellent credit pay.

Homeowners in Washington, D.C., and Ohio had the next highest gap in premiums (185 percent), followed by Montana (179 percent).

In general, insurers are putting a higher emphasis on credit scores than they did last year, with scores having a bigger impact this year than last in 29 states. “It’s more important than ever to maintain a solid credit rating by paying their bills on time, keeping their balances low, and correcting errors on their credit reports,” Laura Adams, insurangeQuotes.com senior analyst said in a statement.

California, Massachusetts and Maryland do not allow insurers to consider credit in setting prices, and insurers in Florida don’t use it.

The average U.S. homeowner’s insurance premium is around $950. In addition to making an effort to boost their credit, homeowners should shop around every few years to see if they can find a better rate.
