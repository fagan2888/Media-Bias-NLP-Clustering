Either way, they lost 1% of their total Medicare DRG payments \u2014 and other hospitals could take the same financial hit down the road \u2014 under the HAC Reduction Program, which was created by the Affordable Care Act. With the amount of dollars at stake, hospitals may want to take a close look at how coding and documentation are affecting their HAC scores.\n\nThe HAC Reduction Program is one of a series of pay-for-performance programs designed to encourage better quality of care by linking payment to value instead of volume of services (RMC 10/20/14, p. 1). Every year starting in 2015, CMS identifies the 25% of hospitals with the most HACs and docks their DRG reimbursement. Performance now will shape the penalties for 2017.\n\nThe assumption is these hospitals have a systemic deficiency in the conditions selected for the HAC Reduction Program, and that some financial pain will motivate quality improvement. But compliance experts have some doubts. \u201cPossibly this is more a documentation problem than a quality problem,\u201d says William Malm, senior manager of revenue integrity communications at Craneware. With deficiencies in electronic health records, Malm adds, \u201cyou have to wonder whether coders, who have to code HACs, don\u2019t see this as part of coding the claim.\u201d If that\u2019s the case, part of the calculus of improving the HAC picture is documentation and coding, he says. \u201cPeople in hospitals are wildly shifting processes to meet the crisis of the day, like the two-midnight rule, and this is overlooked.\u201d\n\nHACs May Be Partly a Coding Issue\n\nHACs are conditions that CMS considers reasonably preventable as opposed to conditions that are present on admission. CMS finalized two domains in the 2015 inpatient prospective payment system regulation, and bases 35% of the HAC score on the first and 65% on the second. The first domain is PSI-90, a composite of eight Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality measures (e.g., pressure ulcers, postoperative sepsis). The second domain includes catheter-associated urinary tract infections; surgical site infections (colon, abdominal hysterectomy); and central-line associated bloodstream infections, which are CDC measures. Hospitals receive zero to 10 points for each measure, representing best to worst. Those with an overall score of 7.25 or above are included in the top 25%, \u201cand the top is where you do not want to be,\u201d says Stephen Harris, director of reimbursement at Tampa General Hospital.\n\nCMS assesses hospital performance on the first domain based on claims filed by the hospitals, says Washington, D.C., attorney Daniel Hettich, who is with King & Spalding. In other words, the accurate reporting of present on admission (POA) codes may determine whether hospitals land in the dreaded quartile, he says. POA codes are straightforward \u2014 \u201cY\u201d for yes, it was POA (and is therefore not a HAC), or \u201cN\u201d for no, it was not POA (and therefore is a HAC), or \u201cU\u201d for unknown, meaning documentation was insufficient to attribute one way or another. \u201cYou get charged with a HAC when you say it was not POA, but you also get charged if your answer is the documentation is insufficient to tell whether the patient arrived with that condition,\u201d Hettich says. \u201cA lack of documentation \u2014 a response of \u201cunknown\u201d \u2014 means you will get charged with a HAC.\u201d\n\nThe documentation to determine which code to select may be lacking, and physicians and coders may not always be attuned to the HAC Reduction Program, some experts say. \u201cYour physician documentation and then your coders will impact your score,\u201d Harris says.\n\nFor the second domain, CMS abstracts a certain number of charts for both Medicare and non-Medicare patients to determine how many had hospital-acquired infections. CMS uses a CDC formula that takes into consideration factors like age. \u201cThey don\u2019t expect a zero infection rate,\u201d Hettich says. \u201cBut every increment above the expected rate is a step closer to this penalty.\u201d\n\nThere is skepticism in some quarters that 724 hospitals are causing surgical-site infections, pressure ulcers and other conditions to the point where they should trigger penalties. Malm, for one, is more inclined to attribute some failures to a process breakdown that implicates documentation and coding.\n\nFor one thing, coders could affect HAC scores at both ends of the spectrum, Harris says. If they are very aggressive, coders may jump the gun on identification of a HAC. \u201cBut if they had gone the extra mile to confer with the physician, maybe they would have been able to determine there wasn\u2019t a HAC,\u201d he says. On the flip side, a less skilled coder may fail to identify a HAC in the medical record.\n\nCoding Variability Is a Problem\n\nHospitals are partly hampered by coding variability \u201cin general and specifically around HACs and patient safety indicators,\u201d says Jeffrey Farber, M.D., vice president for hospital services utilization at the Mount Sinai Health System and associate professor at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. That stems largely from documentation that doesn\u2019t tell the whole story. When physicians document the patient\u2019s urinary tract infection without mentioning a Foley catheter, the UTI isn\u2019t considered catheter associated and coded as a HAC or present on admission, Farber says. \u201cThere are a lot of codes for UTI, but the only one that matters is the catheter-associated UTI,\u201d he says. \u201cCoders are coding what they see in the medical record. Coders are not clinicians. It\u2019s asking a lot of them to say, \u2018I see notes in the flow sheets from the nurse. There is a Foley catheter change but the doctor wrote UTI in the note and no one mentioned a catheter.\u2019\u201d\n\nHACs and other pay-for-performance programs don\u2019t register on physicians anyway, Farber says. \u201cThey should be focused on providing good quality care and documenting good quality care,\u201d he says. \u201cThey should be specific and comprehensive\u201d \u2014 the two terms he uses to educate physicians on documentation. \u201cThey don\u2019t necessarily know what qualifies as a HAC and what exclusion factors are. Let other people do the job of assigning POA indicators,\u201d Farber says. \u201cDoctors should not be intentionally kept out of the loop, but whether they impact the DRG? Doctors don\u2019t care and probably don\u2019t need to.\u201d\n\nAs Malm audits hospital records, he has noticed an absence of references to HACs or POA indicators. In a recent audit of 10 records, for example, there was not \u201ca single word on HACs or POAs.\u201d Some EHR templates are not very prominent, which may lead them to be missed or to complete failure to document the POA. \u201cIn the old days, paper was observable, measurable and recognizable; now, in the EHR, it may be buried as part of a template and no one understands the significance of complete documentation,\u201d Malm says. \u201cIn either case, coding may not capture the data, which then prevents it from being represented in the necessary reporting documents to the government.\u201d\n\nFor example, one hospital\u2018s EHR system asks whether HACs are present in the history and physical, and then defaults to \u201cno.\u201d That will land the hospital in hot water. \u201cWhat I do not see is providers or CMS or anyone digging down into the root cause for this,\u201d Malm says.\n\nHe suggests hospitals in the 25% that were penalized by CMS ask themselves the following questions:\n\nHow are HACs reviewed and documented?\n\nIs there a check and balance to ensure HACs are documented or is there a hard stop in the EHR system?\n\nAre coders aware documentation is there and can they code it and put it on the claims?\n\nDo billers check to ensure HACs are reported on the UB or 837 forms?\n\nHow did we get there? Are we abiding by quality measures to determine if there is substance, and not just coding and documenting weaknesses?\n\n\u00a9 2015 by Atlantic Information Services, Inc.
