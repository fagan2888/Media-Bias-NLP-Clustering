Pineapple Productions brought Blues and BBQ to Panama City Beach August 16th and 17th for the 1st Annual Great American Blues Festival and BBQ Challenge.

It wasn't just about the Blues and BBQ, the event was about donating to a number of charities. The owner of Pineapple Willy's said close to 45 charities will benefit from the two day event.

This was all made possible by owner of Pineapple Willy's Bill Buskell, who put $100,000 into the event, which was matched by the Tourist Development Council for a combined $200,000.

"To get a chance to see some good Blues music, eat some good BBQ, and have an ice cold beer, you can't beat it," said Panama City resident Colin McCormick.

Bill Buskell, owner of Pineapple Willy's said its been on his bucket list for years to bring together some of the best Blues in the nation and pair it with some world class BBQ. "We've been successful with this beach and we need to give back," said owner of Pineapple Willy's Bill Buskell.

Local charities and businesses in the area couldn't be more thrilled about this festival.

"Bill Buskell of Pineapple Willy's to put on a major event like this at this time of the year, to give people things to do for tourists coming to the area to spend time, have fun, and give back," said Beach Care Services charity Debi Knight.

"It's for a good cause and we like BBQ and Blues and bikes," said Harley Davidson Manager, Chuck Dalba.

Even the bands themselves said they can't beat playing for an event like this.

"To play this kind of music with so many bands and be around like minded people that enjoy it. And then on top of it to be able to have it go to a charitable cause, it's just a win, win for everybody," said Blues Band guitarist, Selwyn Birchwood.

According to Pineapple Willy's owner this is just the start of many more Blues to come to the beach.
