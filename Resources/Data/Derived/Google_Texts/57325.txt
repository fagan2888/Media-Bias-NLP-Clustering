Leadership changes have been announced for two Florida Medicaid plans that are merging.

Amerigroup Florida and Simply Healthcare Plans announced in a statement that Lourdes Rivas, the CEO of Simply Healthcare, will be the Florida Medicaid plan president for the new consolidated operations. Amerigroup Florida president and CEO Rosy Cozad, will take a new post within the organization.

Amerigroupâ€™s owner, Anthem, acquired Miami-based Simply Healthcare earlier this year. Rivas will oversee the integrated operations of Amerigroup Florida, Simply Healthcare, Better Health and Clear Health Alliance. The plans provide services to Floridians enrolled in Medicaid, Florida Healthy Kids, managed long-term care, and HIV/AIDS specialty programs.

According to the company, there are more than 560,000 beneficiaries served by these plans. They are offered in 10 of the 11 Medicaid regions in Florida.
