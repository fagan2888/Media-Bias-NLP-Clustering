(Juana Arias/The Washington Post)\n\nSister Mary Ann Walsh, a nun and journalist who helped shape and influence the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops as its media relations director, died April 28 at a hospice in Albany, N.Y. She was 68.\n\nThe death was confirmed by a friend, Sister Amy Hoey. Sister Walsh was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2010 and in 2014 learned that the cancer had metastasized to her brain, bones, liver and lungs.\n\nStarting in 1993, she spent 21 years helping manage communications for the conference, the last seven as media relations director. She was the first woman to serve in that leadership role since the organization\u2019s establishment in 1966.\n\nA veteran Catholic reporter, she helped the American church rebound from the sex-abuse crisis of the early 2000s, coordinated media relations efforts surrounding the two most recent papal elections and most recently sparred with the Obama administration over the Affordable Care Act\u2019s contraception mandate.\n\nIn July 2014, she stepped down from the conference to become the U.S. church correspondent for the weekly Jesuit-run America magazine.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the ideal job, a job of opinion, after working in an institution [the conference] that thought opinion was anathema,\u201d she told the Catholic News Service in February.\n\nDuring her time at the magazine, she profiled church leaders, openly discussed her terminal diagnosis and addressed contemporary issues facing the church in blogs and columns, including women\u2019s leadership roles in the church.\n\n\u201cAs the first female religious to serve on the editorial staff of America, Sr. Walsh was a trailblazer even in this last phase of her professional life,\u201d America magazine editor in chief Matt Malone said in a statement.\n\nMary Ann Walsh was born in Albany on Feb. 25, 1947. The daughter of Irish immigrants, she entered the Sisters of Mercy Roman Catholic convent at 17. She received a master\u2019s degree in English from Albany\u2019s College of St. Rose in 1976 and a master\u2019s degree in pastoral counseling from Baltimore\u2019s Loyola University Maryland in 1990.\n\nShe worked as a schoolteacher in Albany before starting her journalism career at 30 at the Evangelist, a diocesan newspaper in Albany.\n\n\u201cI entered media because I wanted to help people,\u201d Sister Walsh said in a Sisters of Mercy of the Americas video. \u201cI saw people over here who had great needs, and I saw people over here who were willing to meet needs. I thought I could be the bridge. It was the time of Simon and Garfunkel\u2019s \u2018Bridge Over Troubled Waters,\u2019 and that\u2019s what I wanted to be: I wanted to be the bridge over troubled waters.\u201d\n\nShe worked for the Catholic News Service\u2019s bureau in Rome from 1983 to 1986 and later as a national desk reporter and media editor in the news service\u2019s Washington bureau.\n\n1 of 83 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Notable deaths of 2015 View Photos A look at those who have died this year.

The papal visit drew an estimated 750,000 young people from more than 70 countries and became the model structure for future events. Shortly thereafter, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops hired her.\n\nOver the years, she edited books, produced videos and contributed articles and op-eds to publications such as The Washington Post and USA Today.\n\nAs her health declined, she left the Washington area and returned to Albany to live near her family at her old quarters, the Sisters of Mercy convent.\n\nSurvivors include two brothers.\n\nShe received honors for her contributions to Catholic journalism.\n\nLast year, she told the Arlington Catholic Herald that at the beginning of her communications career, some questioned where her loyalties would lie \u2014 to the church or to journalism. She would tell them she was \u201cloyal to the truth.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Mary Ann Walsh, Mary Ann Walsh dies, Mary Ann Walsh obit, Mary Ann Walsh conference of catholic bishops, Mary Ann Walsh died", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "She was the first woman to serve as media relations director for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops.", "title": "Sister Mary Ann Walsh, nun and journalist, dies at 68", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/sister-mary-ann-walsh-nun-and-journalist-dies-at-68/2015/04/29/ebb7f0da-ee7f-11e4-8abc-d6aa3bad79dd_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/04/29/Obituaries/Images/Merlin_742698.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@meganmmcd"}, "description": "She was the first woman to serve as media relations director for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops.", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Mary Ann Walsh, Mary Ann Walsh dies, Mary Ann Walsh obit, Mary Ann Walsh conference of catholic bishops, Mary Ann Walsh died", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "eomportal-uuid": "ebb7f0da-ee7f-11e4-8abc-d6aa3bad79dd"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd94c\"", "article_summary": "Sister Walsh was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2010 and in 2014 learned that the cancer had metastasized to her brain, bones, liver and lungs.\n\u201cI entered media because I wanted to help people,\u201d Sister Walsh said in a Sisters of Mercy of the Americas video.\nSister Mary Ann Walsh greets David Clohessy from the Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests.\nStarting in 1993, she spent 21 years helping manage communications for the conference, the last seven as media relations director.\n(Juana Arias/The Washington Post)Sister Mary Ann Walsh, a nun and journalist who helped shape and influence the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops as its media relations director, died April 28 at a hospice in Albany, N.Y.
