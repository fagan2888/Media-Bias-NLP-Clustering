The Ed Show on MSNBC had nice things to say about its messages which have \"survived.\"\n\nOccupier Justin Wedes in an article in the Guardian vowed that movement members -- even without the platform of Zuccotti Park, that \"We will continue to move forward peacefully and deliberately in order to take back our county, our future and our dreams.\n\nAs to be expected, requisite documentary films that are now appearing. Have they come forth to praise Occupy, or to bury it?\n\nIf producer/videographer Michael Perlman has anything to say about it -- it is the former and not the latter. His just-released film, The 99%: Occupy Everywhere, narrated by Lou Reed, delivers on that promise. It is not only an eye-opener, it is a heart-opener.\n\nWhat might it mean for Americans to have access to films and footage of the violent, physical crackdown of the Occupy Wall Street protestors at Zuccotti Park that infamous morning on November 15, 2011?\n\nI am talking about visuals that never should have been available, as the police forbid the media to be present at this \"cleanup.\" I am talking about the jackbooted thugs passing themselves off as New York City's finest, of course, and their violent crackdown that day.\n\nWhat might it mean to Americans to see and hear a 92-year-old grandmother tell us about how important \"these young people\" in the Occupy Movement are to elderly Americans?\n\nWhat might it mean for Americans to hear from a retired Police Captain who chose to wear his uniform and stand in support of the Occupiers -- bringing about his arrest by his brothers in blue? Or a marine veteran as he re-thinks \"Semper Fi?\"\n\nThey speak with intelligence and passion, through their personal, emotional stories about critical issues of our time including vast income inequality, jobs, debt, affordable health care and education, war, the environment, police-as-military and gun safety. Economist Jeffrey Sachs connects the dots and offer solutions for a fairer and more sustainable future.\n\nThe feeling you will come away with? Long live Occupy! Long live this documentary.\n\nFollow Jerry Ashton on Twitter: www.twitter.com/WrittenOffUSA", "article_metadata": {"description": "If you haven't noticed (no thanks to you, mainstream media), Occupy celebrated its second birthday this month on September 17.  \n\nTo be fair, what covera...", "sailthru.expire_date": "2013-09-23 13:21:25 -0400", "og": {"url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jerry-ashton/occupy-wall-street-at-age_b_3972146.html", "locale": "en_US", "site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "If you haven't noticed (no thanks to you, mainstream media), Occupy celebrated its second birthday this month on September 17.  \n\nTo be fair, what covera...", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"width": 2000, "height": 1000}, "creator": "WrittenOffUSA", "site": "@HuffPostNY", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "If you haven't noticed (no thanks to you, mainstream media), Occupy celebrated its second birthday this month on September 17.  \n\nTo be fair, what covera..."}, "sailthru.date": "2013-09-22 13:21:25 -0400", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=3972146", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "new-york", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "activism,ows,occupy wall street,zuccotti park eviction,Zuccotti Park,occupy movement,New York City", "article": {"section": "New York", "tag": "activism,ows,occupy wall street,zuccotti park eviction,Zuccotti Park,occupy movement,New York City", "published_time": "2013-09-22 13:21:25 -0400", "modified_time": "2013-11-22 05:12:02 -0500"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdec5d\"", "article_summary": "If you haven't noticed (no thanks to you, mainstream media), Occupy celebrated its second birthday this month on September 17.\nWhat might it mean to Americans to see and hear a 92-year-old grandmother tell us about how important \"these young people\" in the Occupy Movement are to elderly Americans?\nThe Ed Show on MSNBC had nice things to say about its messages which have \"survived.\"\nIf producer/videographer Michael Perlman has anything to say about it -- it is the former and not the latter.\nI am talking about visuals that never should have been available, as the police forbid the media to be present at this \"cleanup.\""}
