Who doesn\u2019t want to hear about nifty stuff like that?\n\nIf automotive technology continues to advance at its current pace, \u201cwe may be on the brink of a new day when cars drive themselves,\u201d according to the piece, written by Scott Schrantz and based on Rand Corp. research. \u201cAnd,\u201d it goes on, \u201cmany other circumstances may change significantly as a result.\u201d\n\nAmong the circumstances: fewer crashes and reduced fuel emissions \u2014 both of which will have implications for health care providers.\n\n\u201cIf cars can drive themselves well, experts envision huge safety improvements in both auto fatalities (there were 32,000 in the United States in 2011) and accidents (in which some element of human error was to blame in two-thirds of the cases),\u201d Schrantz quotes James Anderson, senior behavioral scientist who led a recent Rand study.\n\nReduced emissions, of course, means the air we breathe will be a lot less likely to sicken us.\n\nAnd do I even need to mention the benefits to our emotional health of leaving the driving up to the car? Less road rage. More time to relax, work on the computer, Skype our loved ones, read a novel, or \u2014 most appealing to me personally \u2014 get a little more shut-eye.\n\nThere would be other benefits, as well. Autonomous cars could be a boon to people who are blind or disabled. And they would provide better fuel-efficiency and more efficient use of roads because, as the Schrantz puts it, \u201cself-driving cars won\u2019t get bored or distracted, and don\u2019t need to make ego-dives in and out of lanes at alternately fast and slow speeds.\u201d\n\nNaturally, the road ahead is not without its bumps; regulatory issues and cost concerns top the list, and the Rand Review lays out four key policy considerations. But it looks as though what, until recently, seemed like a sci fi fantasy may be on the fast track to becoming reality.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Self-driving cars could mean fewer injuries from crashes, healthier air to breathe and less mental stress.", "csrf-token": "SCZOLj2Cea7ckqnJLZGKZdSQlyjwAETTeo6iW9LEX54=", "twitter": {"image": "http://www.hhnmag.com/ext/resources/inc-hhn/img/articles/article_images/2015/selfdrive_190X127.jpeg?1448315759", "description": "Beyond the gee-whiz factor, these fast-evolving vehicles will have real-life implications for Americans' well-being, and on providers' work.", "card": "summary", "title": "Self-Driving Cars and the Impact on Health"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "og": {"image": "http://www.hhnmag.com/ext/resources/inc-hhn/img/articles/article_images/2015/selfdrive_190X127.jpeg?1448315759", "type": "Article", "description": "Beyond the gee-whiz factor, these fast-evolving vehicles will have real-life implications for Americans' well-being, and on providers' work.", "title": "Self-Driving Cars and the Impact on Health"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/images/favicons/favicon-144.png", "keywords": "new technology, self-driving cars, car crashes, fuel emissions, mental health", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "And, anyway, it\u2019s about self-driving cars.\nAnd do I even need to mention the benefits to our emotional health of leaving the driving up to the car?\n\u201cAnd,\u201d it goes on, \u201cmany other circumstances may change significantly as a result.\u201dAmong the circumstances: fewer crashes and reduced fuel emissions \u2014 both of which will have implications for health care providers.\nAutonomous cars could be a boon to people who are blind or disabled.\nBut it looks as though what, until recently, seemed like a sci fi fantasy may be on the fast track to becoming reality."}
