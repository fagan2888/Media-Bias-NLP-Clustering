A boil water advisory for the New Orleans east bank has ended, the Sewerage and Water Board said Saturday (July 25).

The precautionary advisory was lifted just after 5 p.m. -- 31 hours after residents were first told to avoid drinking or bathing with tap water.

Bacteriological tests "confirmed that water in the area was safe to drink and could be used normally for personal needs," according to a news release.

Residents should flush out plumbing systems by running water, according to the release.

The Carrollton Water Plant experienced a drop in pressure around 3 a.m. on Friday. But the public wasn't alerted to any problems until seven hours later, when the boil water notice was issued at 10 a.m.

City officials have blamed the problem on Entergy power surges. But an Entergy spokeswoman said on Friday that the utility's monitors "do not show any events that occurred at the time being reported by Sewerage & Water Board."

Cedric Grant, the Sewerage and Water Board's executive director, said in the release Saturday afternoon that the advisory was issued "out of an abundance of caution to ensure the public's safety."

"We thank the impacted residents and businesses for their patience and apologize for any inconvenience that this may have caused," he said.
