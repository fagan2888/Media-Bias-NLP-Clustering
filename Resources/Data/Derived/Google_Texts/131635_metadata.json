But there is growing evidence that even GOP voters are more concerned about curbing drug prices than dislodging the president\u2019s signature health program.\n\nIn April, the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation was surprised by a poll showing more Republicans view drug prices as the No. 1 health care priority than repealing Obamacare. So the foundation looked further, asking Americans what steps they would back to reduce drug costs.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe results, released Thursday morning, were equally striking: Nearly three-quarters of Americans think drug prices are unreasonably high \u2014 and most blame that on drug companies\u2019 drive for profits. That\u2019s true among Republicans, Democrats and independents \u2014 a rare point of accord in politics.\n\nTo be sure, Republicans are still gunning for Obamacare.\n\nKaiser\u2019s April poll found repealing the law and its individual mandate came in as Republicans\u2019 second and third top health care priorities, chosen by 60 percent and 52 percent, respectively. That trailed the 66 percent who want the president and Congress to address high drug costs for chronically ill patients.\n\nNonetheless, Republicans are also part of the huge bipartisan majorities that back strong government measures to make drugs affordable, including requiring drug makers to release information on how they set prices (86 percent), allowing Medicare to negotiate for drugs (83 percent), capping what companies can charge for drugs to treat cancer and other life-threatening diseases (76 percent) and importing drugs from Canada (72 percent).\n\nThat\u2019s good news for Democratic contenders, including Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, who are already outlining how government could negotiate lower prices for drugs, which routinely run into the tens of thousands of dollars for new treatments, yielding billions in profits for their developers.\n\nBut Republican candidates have not turned to prescription drug costs, sticking mostly to their promises to repeal Obamacare and replace it with conservative alternatives. Neither Walker nor Rubio mentioned drug costs in their proposals to replace Obamacare this week.\n\nDavid Merritt, a managing director at Luntz Global, a conservative polling and consulting firm, acknowledged the anxiety over drug costs but said the campaign conversation will transcend that issue.\n\n\u201cSpecific to drug costs, I think it will be secondary,\u201d he said. \u201cHealth care as an issue is not going away. Obamacare is not going away. We\u2019re still talking about life and death, but the fight will be around health care in general, with rising prescription drug costs as evidence of what\u2019s wrong.\u201d\n\nGOP candidates are more likely to talk about drug prices as evidence of Obamacare\u2019s failure, said Lanhee Chen, a fellow at the Hoover Institute and former health policy adviser to Mitt Romney.\n\n\u201cRepublicans will be talking about how do we replace the ACA architecture,\u201d he said.\n\nBut that may not be enough, said Bob Blendon, an expert on public opinion and health care at the Harvard School of Public Health.\n\n\u201cThis [drug cost issue] is going to be very visible and people will be living in terror that they won\u2019t be able to pay for this new expensive drug that they need,\u201d he said.\n\nRepublicans in the survey did show a strong preference for solutions that use the marketplace.\n\nAsked whether federal regulation or competition in the marketplace would do better at keeping drug costs down, 51 percent favored competition overall, compared to 40 percent who said regulation. But 76 percent of Republicans chose competition.\n\nPolicies that suggest price controls \u201crun against the instinct most Americans have about the value of innovation in a free market economy,\u201d Chen said. \u201cInnovation needs to be an important part of the conversation.\u201d\n\nGrowing public concern about drug prices is believed to reflect the sharp rise in drug prices over the last year, as well as a steady stream of news coverage about breakthrough, but costly new cures for hepatitis C, cancer and most recently, a previously intractable type of high cholesterol.\n\n\u201cThe mercenary pricing that we\u2019ve seen from the manufacturers is almost like they are daring the Congress to do something about it and knowing that they won\u2019t,\u201d said John Gorman, executive chairman of Gorman Health Group, a health care consultant.\n\nPriced at $84,000 or more, for instance, Gilead\u2019s hepatitis C drugs helped fuel a 13 percent spike in U.S. drug spending in 2014 \u2014 more than double the rate of overall health spending growth \u2014 setting off alarms across the board, from big business groups and insurance plans, state and federal health programs, labor unions and consumer advocates.\n\nEven doctors, who have traditionally sought to keep cost concerns out of the practice of medicine, are increasingly citing the \u201cfinancial toxicity\u201d of drug prices and calling on patients to march for change.\n\nAbsent federal action, bills or voter initiatives in California, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Ohio aim to cap drug prices at the state level. Advocates in California announced Thursday that they had secured almost 370,000 signatures for a ballot initiative to cap what state health programs pay for drugs at the same low prices negotiated by the Department of Veterans Affairs. If certified, that would land the measure on the 2016 presidential ballot in the largest state in the nation. The AIDS Healthcare Foundation, which sponsored the initiative, launched a parallel campaign in Ohio this week, aiming for the 2016 ballot.\n\nAnd several state bills, backed by the insurance industry, would require drug companies to disclose research and development and other costs that justify their pricing.\n\nWhile Hillary Clinton has signaled support for a greater role for the government in driving down drug prices, she hasn\u2019t yet released a detailed policy.\n\nIn June, she said that if drug companies succeed in boosting their foreign sales through favorable provisions in the ongoing 12-country Trans-Pacific Partnership trade talks, they should give bulk discounts to government health programs.\n\n\u201cOur drug companies, if they are going to get what they want, they should give more to America,\u201d she said, according to Reuters. The campaign did not return a request for comment on this story.\n\nHer chief primary opponent, Bernie Sanders, is a long-time backer of a national single-payer health care system, and supports making Medicare an active negotiator. He and Rep. Elijah Cummings are also investigating dramatic recent hikes in the costs of older generic drugs and introduced a bill this spring that would force companies to pay rebates to the Medicaid program if generic prices grew faster than inflation.\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this story incorrectly identified John Gorman\u2019s title.
