Unlike many of Breitbart\u2019s friends and admirers who initiated a relationship with him, I was forced to relate with him. And I don\u2019t like being forced to do anything.\n\nI initially met Andrew Breitbart over the phone when I called him on September 8, 2009. That was the day before my daughter Hannah\u2019s scandalous ACORN videos were released on the public\u2019s head.\n\nAndrew was on the road, and I was in Vail about to speak at a men\u2019s conference and wanted to know, from a man I didn\u2019t know, if he was going to make certain my girl would be \u201csafe\u201d in every sense of the word because the ACORNs were fixin\u2019 to hit the fan.\n\nHaving seen several of Hannah\u2019s devastating undercover vids and knowing the weight of what was about to land on my 20-year-old, I told Andrew that if he allowed anything bad to happen to Hannah that I would hurt him. And I did not mean that metaphorically.\n\nBreitbart said he would defend Hannah with his life and treat her as if she were his own daughter. I thought, \u201cgood answer,\u201d and with that we began a relationship and went through a tornadic, grueling, and thrilling war against a corrupt organization and a crooked media that covers and defends such sleaze.\n\nEvery step of the way, through vicious, non-stop media attacks, death threats to our family, and multiple lawsuits, Breitbart kept his word to me and ran interference for Hannah and the ACORN story like a champion. He made certain that the proper people got crushed and the truth tellers remained afloat.\n\nAs stated, I didn\u2019t meet Andrew as a fan; I met him as a father who doesn\u2019t give a rat\u2019s backside about any celebrity in the conservative movement\u2014the reason being that I\u2019ve met a lot of them and have yet to be duly impressed by most. (The majority are preening narcissists who\u2019d skin their granny if it would get them on Hannity. Call me jaded.)\n\nTherefore, when Hannah\u2019s fantastic work propelled her into a world with a lot of Slim Shadies, suffice it to say my claws were out. Andrew, however, made my talons retract because he kept his word to me (and then some), which moved me from being a skeptic to an ally of that wild-haired heat-seeking missile named Andrew Breitbart.\n\nHere\u2019s my takeaway from a man I didn\u2019t seek to meet but am sure glad I did:\n\n1.As stated, Breitbart kept his word and stayed in the volatile fray with Hannah just like he promised. Few people keep their word nowadays.\n\n2.To Andrew, crap was crap no matter how one framed it. Andrew was an equal opportunity offender. Everything smells, so attitude sells.\n\n3.Breitbart was bold. Would to God more men who love God and country had his moxie. AB was a provocateur par excellence.\n\n4.He inspired young people who are sick of lies, hype and spin to take their talent and tools and use them against the tools of the machine.\n\n5.Andrew understood the importance of conservatives getting involved in Hollywood and not just in DC.\n\n6.Breitbart, by example, showed us all that if you aren\u2019t drawing enemy fire then you\u2019re not over the target.\n\n7.If you didn\u2019t agree with Andrew on all the issues, he was okay with that and reveled in robust discussions over cold beer.\n\nLastly, I\u2019m not going to pretend that I was super close to Andrew because I wasn\u2019t. Once the ACORN dust settled we spoke just a few times over the phone, on my show and in DC. That said, I was close enough and our relationship was under enough duress that we had to trust each other and navigate serious rapids. I\u2019m here to tell you that I found Breitbart to be a man of integrity who walked what he talked.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It\u2019s now been two years since Andrew Breitbart died.
