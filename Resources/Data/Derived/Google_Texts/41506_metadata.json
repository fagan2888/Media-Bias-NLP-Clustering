I will be returning to the United States in June, after the March 31 enrollment deadline. Is there any way to enroll in June? -- Arvind Lonkar\n\nYes.\n\nMarch 31 is the last day to enroll in Obamacare without incurring a penalty for not having insurance in 2014. The penalty is $95 or 1 percent of your income, whichever is greater.\n\nAfter March 31, most people will not be able to sign up until the next open enrollment period which will run from Nov. 14 through Jan. 15, 2015.\n\nPeople can sign up outside the open enrollment period if they experience what the government calls a \"qualifying life event.\"\n\nMoving is one of those events, whether you are moving back here from another country or relocating within the United States.\n\nHere are some of the other circumstances that would allow you to sign up outside the open enrollment period:\n\nGetting married;\n\nHaving or adopting a child;\n\nLosing other health coverage because of a job loss, divorce or loss of Medicaid eligibility.\n\nPeople eligible for Medicaid or Child Health Plus are not subject to the open enrollment periods and can sign up any time.\n\nSend your questions about Obamacare to James T.
