John McCain is really angry about a recent ISIS victory in Ramadi, Iraq. So angry, that he took to name calling when speaking about White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest.

“Bodies are on fire in the streets of Ramadi as we are speaking,” McCain said on Fox News’s “America’s Newsroom.” “[ISIS] is an evil — this is a transcendent evil that the President seems to dismiss it as ‘We’re not losing.’ ”

He then called Earnest an “idiot” for saying Tuesday, ““Are we going to light our hair on fire every time there’s a setback against ISIL?”

Bill Hemmer called out McCain’s name-calling, and the Arizona Republican immediately retracted.

“I’ll retract that,” he said. “It’s infuriating though to hear someone say [that]. That betrays everything that America believes in and stands for.”

It’s not the first time McCain has done his best Grandpa Simpson impression:

In march, he resorted to some creative name-calling when discussing the Iran nuclear negotiations.

As one of 47 senators that sent a letter to Iran threatening to subvert negotiations, McCain said that the issue with the situation was how President Obama was classifying the “agreement.”

“This is clearly a treaty,” McCain said, according to The Hill. “They can call it a banana, but it’s a treaty.”
