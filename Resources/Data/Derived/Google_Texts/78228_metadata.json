His name is the most popular among males registered for the Memorial Day race.\n\nSomething else that he shares with his fellow racers, both men and women, is his appreciation for military service members.\n\nCross, who will be running the race for the fourth time, recounted his favorite Bolder Boulder memory:\n\n\"When I finished, I was up in the bleachers just watching the other runners and there was the group of Army men. They were all running together in formation, holding an American flag. Then they diverted to do a little bit of a workout. It was just really cool. When they came running in, the entire stadium lit up, just a bunch of yelling and cheering. It's really cool to see the support that people have for the military.\"\n\nA recent graduate of and two-sport athlete at Faith Baptist High School in Longmont, Cross will run on his own for the second time with the goal of crossing the finish line in around 40 minutes.\n\n\"It's a good challenge and I like to challenge myself,\" he said.\n\nJennifer Osieczanek, Camera Sports Editor", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/bolderboulder/ci_25823849/2014-bolder-boulder-why-we-race-david-cross", "endDate": "2024-05-23T14:56:33-0600", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:25823849:view"}, "startDate": "2014-05-24T17:57:13-0600", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "David Cross will be one of 687 Bolder Boulder racers named David (or Dave) running Monday's 10K.
