(Of course he was asked whether the executive branch should enforce laws the Supreme Court deems unconstitutional, as if that were a perfectly reasonable question. So it\u2019s not entirely his fault.) Still, this isn\u2019t the kind of thing you hear from presidential candidates every day:\n\n\u201cWe need to get into a discussion of this because it has changed from the original intent.\u201d\n\nActually, 1803 was pretty close to the \u201corigin\u201d of the constitution. One of the parties in Marbury vs Madison was even one of its originators. So second-guessing judicial review a couple of centuries later on the basis of original intent is fairly absurd. But it is in keeping with a certain far-right belief, which has held for decades that the courts are \u201clegislating\u201d from the bench. This goes back to an earlier time when the Supreme Court was in the hands of a liberal majority that was \u201clegislating\u201d that bigots stop discriminating against racial and ethnic minorities, which the right has always felt was an infringement on their freedom (or of their state\u2019s rights at the very least).\n\nPhyllis Schlafly\u2019s Eagle Forum described it this way:\n\nIn 1953, newly-elected President Dwight Eisenhower appointed Earl Warren to be the Chief Justice of the United States. This nomination proved to be the first shot fired in a judicial/constitutional revolution which continues today. As Robert Bork has stated, \u201c[The Warren Court] stands first and alone as a legislator of policy, whether the document it purported to apply was the Constitution or a statute. Other Courts had certainly made policy that was not theirs to make, but the Warren Court so far surpassed the others as to be different in kind.\u201d The Warren Court (1953-1969) fueled the Culture War into an inferno and then placed the federal judiciary squarely in the white-hot center of the conflagration. \u201cImpeach Earl Warren\u201d signs exploded like rockets across the nation as Americans began to realize what was happening. But the courts and the Constitution have remained at the center of our culture conflict, and much of the Warren Court\u2019s legacy remains intact.\n\nCarson may be taking this to an extreme but it doesn\u2019t come out of nowhere. It\u2019s only surprising to the extent that he and the rest of the fringe haven\u2019t noticed that the courts have been successfully packed by conservatives and centrists during the last 30 years; his argument doesn\u2019t quite have the same salience it had back in the day. Moreover, he doesn\u2019t seem to have heard about the latest front in the right\u2019s legal revolution: suing bureaucrats over federal regulations.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note here that the right\u2019s loathing of the federal government is actually quite narrowly focused on certain areas of interest. They are fully behind the neoconservatives\u2019 imperial project \u2014 flag waving and martial strutting are fundamental to American conservatism. (Small government is a very imprecise term; they have no problem with a big military and police apparatus. In fact, those bureaucracies have a blank check.) But within that narrow anti-government focus of low taxes is their extreme hostility to government regulations.\n\nSo now we see the conservative movement \u2014 which, not for nothing, has historically regarded the profession of \u201ctrial lawyer\u201d as something only slightly above \u201cmafia hitman\u201d in terms of social disapprobation \u2014 considering the idea of flooding the courts with frivolous suits. But perhaps an even more remarkable feature of this plan is that it\u2019s being floated by none other than the man who brought us the racist right wing tract \u201cThe Bell Curve,\u201d Charles Murray.\n\nMurray has a new book coming out that is poised to take the conservative and libertarian world by storm. It\u2019s called \u201cBy the People: Rebuilding Liberty Without Permission,\u201d and in it Murray proclaims, \u201cthe government cannot enforce its mountain of laws and regulations without voluntary compliance.\u201d His book proposes to create \u201ca private-sector counterweight that pulls back the curtain and exposes the Wizard\u2019s weakness.\u201d The private sector counterweight, in this case, will be a billionaire-funded institution that will bankroll thousands of lawsuits against the government, which Murray fatuously names \u201cThe Madison Institute.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The man most famous for the deeply racist \"The Bell Curve\" has found a solution to Big Government: Sue it to death", "title": "The GOP\u2019s Scientology strategy: How Charles Murray\u2019s perverse anti-government agenda has won over the American right", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The man most famous for the deeply racist \"The Bell Curve\" has found a solution to Big Government: Sue it to death", "title": "The GOP\u2019s Scientology strategy: How Charles Murray\u2019s perverse anti-government agenda has won over the American right", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/12/the_gops_scientology_strategy_how_charles_murrays_perverse_anti_government_agenda_has_won_over_the_american_right/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2010/06/poor_charles_murray_underpaid_by_liberal_media.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The man most famous for the deeply racist \"The Bell Curve\" has found a solution to Big Government: Sue it to death", "title": "The GOP\u2019s Scientology strategy: How Charles Murray\u2019s perverse anti-government agenda has won over the American right", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2010/06/poor_charles_murray_underpaid_by_liberal_media.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Heather Digby Parton", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, anti-government, Charles Murray, Conservatism, federalism, Jeb Bush, The Bell Curve, The Republican Party", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "One of the parties in Marbury vs Madison was even one of its originators.\nBut the courts and the Constitution have remained at the center of our culture conflict, and much of the Warren Court\u2019s legacy remains intact.\nMoreover, he doesn\u2019t seem to have heard about the latest front in the right\u2019s legal revolution: suing bureaucrats over federal regulations.\nAs Robert Bork has stated, \u201c[The Warren Court] stands first and alone as a legislator of policy, whether the document it purported to apply was the Constitution or a statute.\nMurray has a new book coming out that is poised to take the conservative and libertarian world by storm."}
