To the Editor:

Explaining why she aligns herself with the Republican Party (“Back From Tour, Group Plans to Give Women a Bigger Voice in the G.O.P.,” news article, Dec. 29), Sarah Chamberlain, president of the Republican Main Street Partnership, says that she approves of the G.O.P.’s fiscal approach. She added: “I have never really been into the social issues. Birth control is important, but it is not driving money in my account.”

In fact, no-copayment birth control, as mandated by the Affordable Care Act, does drive money into the accounts of millions of women and families. Under Obamacare, in 2013 women saved an estimated $1.4 billion on their out-of-pocket costs for the pill alone — and that’s not even taking into account their savings on intrauterine devices, hormonal implants and the other 12 Food and Drug Administration-approved birth control methods that insurance companies are mandated to cover.

If this isn’t an economic issue, I don’t know what is.
