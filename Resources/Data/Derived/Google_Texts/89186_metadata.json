Rowling, lego, The LEGO Movie, Warner, Technology News, Business News\n\nWhat is Jeff Bezos thinking? At the New York Times, David Streitfeld reports that since mid-May Amazon has been blocking pre-orders for Warner DVDs \u2014 including \u201cThe Lego Movie.\u201d At issue is the same underlying dynamic at work in Amazon\u2019s fight with the Hachette publishing conglomerate: Amazon is meeting unprecedented resistance as it pressures its suppliers to lower their prices.\n\nThe confrontations indicate that Amazon\u2019s long-stated desire to sell everything to everybody might be taking a back seat. The biggest book release in the middle of June is the new J. K. Rowling novel from Hachette; the biggest movie is \u201cLego.\u201d Amazon is basically telling its customers to go elsewhere for them, which is a very un-Amazon thing to do.\n\nThe Hachette showdown showered the normally publicity-conscious Amazon with a hailstorm of bad press, but Streitfeld writes that \u201cAmazon\u2019s tactics with Warner Home Video are unlikely to provoke as much of an uproar, since DVDs do not carry the cultural weight of books.\u201d I\u2019m not so sure about that. Lego is a brand name with serious weight in key demographic circles \u2014 namely, parents of Lego-obsessed kids. \u201cAmazon blocks Lego\u201d is a sound bite with brand-name punch. How long can Bezos bear seeing articles that include sentences like \u201cFirst they came for Harry Potter\u2019s author, and now they have come for your Lego\u201d?", "article_metadata": {"description": "What madness is this?
