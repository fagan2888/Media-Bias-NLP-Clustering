(AP) - Black lawmakers told a quickly-assembled Statehouse rally to save South Carolina State University that they will make sure the school does not close.\n\nSeveral hundred people showed up on a cold Monday for the rally which the NAACP first announced three days earlier.\n\nThe gathering came less than a week after a House panel stunned the university by passing a proposal to temporarily close SC State for a massive overhaul, then reopen it in 2017. While it quickly became apparent the idea wouldn\u2019t get through the Senate, black leaders were still stunned that such a radical step could even be suggested.\n\nSupporters of the closing proposal said the university has done little to address at least $10 million in debt, declining enrollment and a low graduation rate.\n\nSpeakers at the rally told the crowd that SC State alumni need to give money to the school and encourage their children and others that the state\u2019s only public historically black university is a good place to get a degree.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t just party hardy and tailgate outside of football games,\u201d said the Rev. Joe Darby, a SC State alum and leader in the state\u2019s civil rights movement.\n\nBut Darby said plenty of blame should also go toward a state government that gives more to other public schools than it does to the one founded to educate blacks.\n\n\u201cThe state of South Carolina has a sad and sorry history of only giving S.C. State enough to get by,\u201d Darby said.\n\nThe proposal to temporarily close the university will be heard by the House Ways and Means Committee on Tuesday. Three black House members who are on the committee were introduced at the rally.\n\n\u201cSC State is not going to close,\u201d said Rep. Joe Neal, D-Hopkins.\n\nSC State President Thomas Elzey didn\u2019t speak at the rally as trustees were holding a finance committee meeting later Monday.\n\nAttendance at the rally appeared to be close to the same number of people who attend the state chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People\u2019s chief civil rights event of the year - the Martin Luther King Jr. Day rally at the Statehouse.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Black lawmakers told a quickly-assembled Statehouse rally to save South Carolina State University that they will make sure the school does not close.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Black lawmakers told a quickly-assembled Statehouse rally to save South Carolina State University that they will make sure the school does not close.", "title": "Black lawmakers promise SC State will not close at rally", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/feb/16/naacp-plans-statehouse-rally-to-support-sc-state/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/16/f091e24094b854076e0f6a706700e481.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/16/f091e24094b854076e0f6a706700e481.jpg", "description": "Black lawmakers told a quickly-assembled Statehouse rally to save South Carolina State University that they will make sure the school does not close.", "card": "summary", "title": "Black lawmakers promise SC State will not close at rally"}, "Author": "JEFFREY COLLINS", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "COLUMBIA, S.C.
