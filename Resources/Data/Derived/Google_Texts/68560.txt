Warren Buffett and Bill Gates don’t seem like such an unlikely pair. Both are extremely wealthy, both have made sizable contributions to the American economic and innovative spheres, and both are staunch progressives who have worked together on many initiative in the past, such as Mr. Gates’s foundation, and Mr. Buffett’s Giving Pledge. But, add the famously conservative casino-magnate Sheldon Adelson into the mix, and you’ve got an unlikely partnership, indeed.

The trio nonetheless came together today to pen an Op-Ed column on immigration reform for The New York Times. Acknowledging their vast ideological differences, and even the slight differences in their respective approaches to immigration policy, Mr. Buffett, Mr. Gates and Mr. Adelson write, “We could without doubt combine to draft a bill acceptable to each of us. We hope that fact holds a lesson: You don’t have to agree on everything in order to cooperate on matters about which you are reasonably close to agreement. It’s time this brand of thinking finds its way to Washington.”

“Most Americans believe that our country has a clear and present interest in enacting immigration legislation that is both humane to immigrants living here and a contribution to the well-being of our citizens,” they write. “Many of these people, of course, want to return to their home country – and that’s fine. But for those who wish to stay and work in computer science or technology, fields badly in need of their services, let’s roll out the welcome mat.”



In honor of this historic meeting of the minds, here is a brief history of conservative thinkers, lawmakers, and commentators coming forward and supporting immigration reform.
