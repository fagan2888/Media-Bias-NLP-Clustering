Likewise, there is no place in the Constitution authorizing any branch of the federal government to redefine marriage away from its millennia-old assertion that a union is of one man and one woman. But the Supreme Court has just sanctioned these federal power grabs adding both to an already frightening accumulation of federal dominance.\n\nThomas Jefferson commented on this kind of possibility when he wrote:\n\nWhen all government, domestic and foreign, in little as in great things, shall be drawn to Washington as the center of all power, it will render powerless the checks provided of one government upon another and will become as venal and oppressive as the government from which we separated.\n\nIt is hardly an excess to conclude that these two power grabs are not alone, and that all government is being \u201cdrawn to Washington.\u201d\n\nOur nation\u2019s third president looked ahead and worried about such an accumulation of power by the federal courts. In 1821, twelve years after he left the Presidency, Jefferson wrote:\n\nIt has long been my opinion \u2026 that the germ of dissolution of our federal government is in the constitution of the federal judiciary \u2026 working like gravity by night and by day, gaining a little today and a little tomorrow, and advancing its noiseless step like a thief over the field of jurisdiction, until all shall be usurped from the States, and the government of all be consolidated into one.\n\nWhen Congress wrote the Affordable Care Act (that\u2019s the official name for ObamaCare), its text stated that tax credit subsidies were to be given to people living where a marketplace for the insurance, called an exchange, had been \u201cestablished by the state.\u201d Some sharp eyes noted that the federal government, not the states, was already operating the sites where people could sign up. In other words, the feds were breaking the law that clearly said these exchanges were to be state-run. A suit, known as King v. Burwell, went all the way to the Supreme Court. Legal scholars felt correctly that a victory for the plaintiffs would wreck ObamaCare. Fans of federal involvement in the medical industry knew that something had to be done.\n\nAnd it was done \u2014 in a way that even Jefferson himself would likely not have ever imagined. The Court ruled 6 to 3 in an opinion written by Chief Justice John Roberts that those who created the law didn\u2019t mean what they had stated, and that \u201cestablished by the state\u201d didn\u2019t mean that the exchanges (the insurance marketplaces) had to be under state jurisdiction.\n\nWhat happened here is a continuation of revolutionary court action: the Supreme Court actually re-wrote the law. Justice Scalia\u2019s dissent noted that the words \u201cby the state\u201d were removed from the law \u201cseven times.\u201d The Supreme Court has no authorization to make law because the Constitution\u2019s very first sentence states, \u201cAll legislative powers \u2026 shall be vested in Congress.\u201d In effect, the current Supreme Court has changed the Constitution\u2019s word \u201call\u201d to mean \u201csome, if we think it\u2019s necessary.\u201d It has no authority to do so.\n\nSo what should be done? States should continue to nullify this clearly unconstitutional law. More and more Americans are clamoring for the states to stand up to the feds. State legislators should oblige them. Our newest video on nullification demonstrates how nullification works and why it works well.\n\nAlso, the Constitution, that still stands and to which each Supreme Court justice and each member of Congress still swears a solemn oath to honor, deals with a potentially rogue court in Article III, Section 2. It states: \u201cThe supreme court shall have appellate jurisdiction \u2026 with such exceptions, and under such regulations as the Congress shall make.\u201d\n\nIn other words, the Congress that has just been insulted by the Supreme Court\u2019s arrogance in rewriting its law can pass a measure barring the Supreme Court from having anything to say about the matter. If it followed this path, Thomas Jefferson would rest more easily. And so would all Americans who don\u2019t want the federal government to control the medical profession via ObamaCare.\n\nJohn F.
