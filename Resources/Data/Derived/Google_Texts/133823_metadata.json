But Roberts is no liberal: He voted, after all, against gay marriage, against the Voting Rights Act, and for the Citizens United campaign finance ruling that many on the left find onerous.\n\nSo how to explain John Roberts?\n\nHe\u2019s an umpire with a slippery strike zone, says Joel Mathis\n\nRemember when John Roberts told us he would be an umpire, calling only \u201cballs and strikes\u201d? Turns out his strike zone is as slippery as any major leaguer\u2019s.\n\nOccasionally, that slipperiness ends up with a result to liberals\u2019 liking \u2014 like the recent ruling that saved Obamacare. While conservatives howled at him, it seems clear that Roberts decided not to subvert the plain will of Congress over a pedantic bit of copy editing.\n\n\u201cWords have meaning,\u201d Antonin Scalia sniffed afterward, and it\u2019s true, but words don\u2019t have meaning apart from their context. Roberts recognized this, Scalia chose not to, and which seems like a wiser approach to you? The conservative ideal that the legislative branches are owed deference, though, was consistently upheld with Roberts\u2019 vote in the case.\n\nIf only he stuck to the idea consistently. Some of the most notable rulings in his tenure \u2014 on Citizens United and, more bewilderingly, the Voting Rights Act \u2014 directly contravene the \u201cdefer to Congress\u201d ideal.\n\nSome of this is principled, perhaps, but some of it surely is not. While conservatives like to make a fetish of a consistent worldview that produces consistent outcomes, it turns out they are not mere law-reading robots, but humans, prone to inconsistency, whims, and the occasional thumb on the judicial scale. Scalia is (mostly) the rare exception, and it\u2019s notable that he\u2019s become most famous for his dissents from majority opinions.\n\nI saw Roberts give a speech a few years ago on, of all things, the Louisiana Purchase. President Jefferson, Roberts suggested in the speech, might not have had the Constitutional authority to make that purchase . but it was a good thing that he did, anyway.\n\nThere\u2019s a principle at work there, admittedly. It\u2019s not one that conservative legal theorists like to admit to sharing. But Roberts is young, folks. We\u2019ve got another 20 years to figure out what he really thinks.\n\nJoel Mathis is associate editor for Philadelphia Magazine.

No, he is Humpty Dumpty. \u201cWhen I use a word,\u201d Humpty Dumpty told Alice in Lewis Carroll\u2019s story, \u201cit means just what I choose it to mean \u2014 neither more nor less.\u201d\n\nRoberts sits at the head of a court filled with Humpty Dumptys. With the notable exceptions of Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, whose jurisprudence is well-articulated, generally consistent (at least to anyone who bothers to read them) and quite different from Roberts\u2019, these justices often use words to mean whatever suits them on a case-by-case basis.\n\nSo we saw the chief justice make one pronouncement on what the law is on a Thursday, and contradict himself the very next day.\n\n\u201c(T)his Court is not a legislature,\u201d Roberts wrote in his dissenting opinion in Obergefell v. Hodges. \u201cWhether same-sex marriage is a good idea should be of no concern to us. Under the Constitution, judges have power to say what the law is, not what it should be. The people who ratified the Constitution authorized courts to exercise \u2018neither force nor will but merely judgment.\u2019\u201d\n\nYes, precisely as Alexander Hamilton put it in Federalist 78 \u2014 a clear statement of the limits of judicial power that the High Court jettisoned 80 years ago.\n\nAnd so, behold Roberts in New Deal mode, writing for the five-justice majority in the Obamacare case just one day earlier: \u201cHere, the statutory scheme compels us to reject petitioners\u2019 interpretation because it would destabilize the individual insurance market in any State with a Federal Exchange, and likely create the very \u2018death spirals\u2019 that Congress designed the Act to avoid.\u201d\n\nStated more simply, whether federally subsidized state health insurance exchanges are a good idea is of great concern to the court. Because thanks to decades of legislating from the bench, judges have the power to say what the law is as well as what it should be.\n\nThe people who ratified the Constitution might have authorized courts to exercise \u201cneither force nor will but merely judgment,\u201d but, hey \u2014 we\u2019ve come a long way, baby.\n\nBen Boychuk is associate editor of the Manhattan Institute\u2019s City Journal.
