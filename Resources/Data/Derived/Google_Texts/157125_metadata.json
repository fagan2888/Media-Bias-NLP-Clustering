The Washington Post called RTTT \u201ca clever way around federal laws that prohibit Washington from interfering in what takes place in the classroom.\u201d\n\nBreitbart News reported on the President\u2019s 2014 State of the Union address where he urged states to partake in RTTT Pre-K funding, also as part of Common Core. Even though Texas did not participate in RTTT, Houston ISD applied independently for a district version of the Fed Led Ed grant and won $30 million in 2013.\n\nObama\u2019s universal preschool is rooted in Early Head Start, a pre-preschool version of Head Start. Head Start\u2019s Program Standards or the National Institute for Early Education Research are cited as the program\u2019s benchmarks. This pre-K also comes with a mandate for voluntary home visits.\n\nAccording to the 2013 White House blog, these home visiting programs enable nurses, social workers, and other professionals to connect families to services and educational support that will improve a child\u2019s health, development, and ability to learn.\n\nHowever, Head Start findings have been dismal, showing no real lasting benefits; yet, the President intends to expand on it to grow national preschool while incentivizing full-day kindergarten policies.\n\nThe Preschool Development Grants presentation stated that two program requirements for the preschool development, expansion and RTT- ELC programs are a longitudinal data system \u201clinking early childhood and K-12 data,\u201d and providing researchers \u201cwith access to data.\u201d\n\nOne of the greatest outcries against the Common Core has been over privacy issues and data-tracking and collection of the nation\u2019s K-12 population as Breitbart Texas reported. Like the Common Core, this preschool is also touted as voluntary, state led, and high quality standards that are evidence-based. In reality, education experts have deemed the Fed Led Ed program as unproven, low quality, and far from voluntary or state led.\n\nEligible four year-old children must come from families whose income is 200% or below the federal poverty line, in a distressed or \u201chigh needcommunity\u201d that is Promise zoned. Promise zones are also known as Promise neighborhoods and are also part of the American Federation of Teacher\u2019s \u201cPromise Schools,\u201d a union initiative that transforms the local public school into the hub of community life, which Breitbart Texas reported. Children identified as under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) are also eligible.\n\n\u201cOne way to begin closing the achievement gap in Texas is to better prepare children who are entering our public schools,\u201d Williams stated in the TEA release. \u201cWith many high-quality pre-k programs already established in our communities, this federal grant opportunity allows an avenue to enhance and build upon that success.\u201d\n\nAlso, the White House document from last year claimed that universal preschool was fully funded through the President\u2019s budget, investing $75 billion over 10 years into Fed Led Ed, Jr. without adding \u201cone dime to the deficit.\u201d\n\nThe estimated first year instate enrollment is 37,644 children from low and moderate income brackets plus another 61,897 Texas toddlers (aged 0-3) currently served by the Child Care and Development Block Grant\u2019s infant and toddler Head Start plus 126,521 low income mothers identified as giving birth each year who may benefit by this government program.\n\nThis will bring more Fed Led Ed into Texas. Breitbart Texas has reported on how Texas has inched its way into a K-12 federal noose through the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) waiver and new College & Career Readiness Standards on its student accountability and teacher evaluations. This continues to erode the separation between the state\u2019s education standards and Fed Led Ed, even though Texas did not adopt the Common Core State Standards.\n\nAccording to the TEA news release, Texas is one of 35 states, along with the District of Columbia, that is eligible for this big bucks expansion grant contest because it serves a required 10 percent or more of four-year olds in established preschool programs.\n\nTEA will submit its formal application by the Oct. 14 submission deadline. The federal government will then announce winners in December. Under the program criteria, awarded funds will begin serving students on or before Dec. 31, 2015.\n\nFollow Merrill Hope on Twitter @OutOfTheBoxMom.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Education Commissioner Vies For $30 Million In Contest That Will Bring Obama's Universal Pre-K Into Texas", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Education Commissioner Vies For $30 Million In Contest That Will Bring Obama's Universal Pre-K Into Texas", "title": "Education Commissioner Vies For $30 Million In Contest That Will Bring Obama's Universal Pre-K Into Texas - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Breitbart-Texas/2014/09/13/Pre-K-Classroom-AP.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/texas/2014/09/14/education-commisioner-vies-for-30-million-in-contest-that-will-bring-obamas-prek-into-texas/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Education Commissioner Vies For $30 Million In Contest That Will Bring Obama's Universal Pre-K Into Texas", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Breitbart-Texas/2014/09/13/Pre-K-Classroom-AP.jpg", "title": "Education Commissioner Vies For $30 Million In Contest That Will Bring Obama's Universal Pre-K Into Texas - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Common Core, Universal, White House,Breitbart Texas,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Breitbart Texas", "tag": "White House", "published_time": "2014-09-14T05:33:24-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart Texas"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "Head Start\u2019s Program Standards or the National Institute for Early Education Research are cited as the program\u2019s benchmarks.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERDALLAS, Texas \u2014 Texas Education Commissioner Michael Williams notified the U.S. Department of Education that the Texas Education Agency (TEA) will submit an application for a federal preschool expansion grant that is part of the Obama Administration\u2019s Pre-K for All program, the Texas Education Agency (TEA) announced in a news release on September 10, 2014.\nIn reality, education experts have deemed the Fed Led Ed program as unproven, low quality, and far from voluntary or state led.\nLike the Common Core, this preschool is also touted as voluntary, state led, and high quality standards that are evidence-based.\nEven though Texas did not participate in RTTT, Houston ISD applied independently for a district version of the Fed Led Ed grant and won $30 million in 2013."}
