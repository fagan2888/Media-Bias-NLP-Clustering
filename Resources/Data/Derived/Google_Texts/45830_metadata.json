Our story comes to us from New York\u2019s 21st congressional district, also locally known as \u201cthe North country\u201d for its rural, mountainous nature. Many long time election fans will better remember it as it was known before the last census redistricting when it was NY-23 and the site of the 2009 special election debacle featuring Dede Scozzafava. (The less said about that, the better.) This year the seat is being vacated by Democrat Bill Owens and there are two relatively unknown contenders seeking to replace him. The party of the donkey has nominated self-funding millionaire film producer Aaron Woolf, while the Republicans have small businesswoman Elise Stefanik.\n\nRecently, a Woolf supporter penned a letter to the editor of the Watertown paper demanding to know if Elise (who is single) has any \u201cprivate relationships\u201d with anyone, and who such a person might be. The letter came from Mike Flynn, a self-described Democrat political analyst and Woolf supporter, and the leering implications of questioning the candidate\u2019s private dating and romantic history were enough to put anyone off their feed. The Woolf campaign quickly tried to distance themselves from the letter, calling it, \u201creprehensible and antithetic\u201d to what his campaign is about. But as the Daily Caller reported, there was more to the story than originally met the eye.\n\nFlynn didn\u2019t take his dismissal lightly, firing back by releasing off-the-record Facebook and email correspondence with the Woolf campaign and state Democratic party \u2014 communications he claims prove he was \u201con-message\u201d and working on the campaign\u2019s behalf. The grammatically-challenged letter noted that the 30-year-old Stefanik \u201chadn\u2019t mentioned anything about her significant other, nor had she been asked by the Fourth Estate about any ongoing relationship she was involved with in her private life . . . I don\u2019t think this falls under the heading of prying eyes.\u201d\n\nSo Flynn apparently was in cahoots with the Woolf campaign and wanted to get the question out there in the public eye. But would anyone in their right mind be asking this question if the candidate were a young, single male? Isn\u2019t this rather War on Womenish?\n\nPerhaps the Woolf campaign was just getting a little desperate. Despite having a huge financial advantage over Stefanik \u2013 who is essentially running a campaign across a vast, sparsely populated district on little more than shoe leather \u2013 she has somehow opened up a double digit lead in the latest polling. And in another rather humorous twist to this race, isn\u2019t it usually the Democrats who are demanding that rich, fat cat Republicans release their tax returns? In this case, it\u2019s Democrat Woolf who has come under scrutiny for the same thing.\n\nElise Stefanik is calling on Aaron Woolf to release his tax returns to the public. Woolf has come out in favor of the Buffet Rule, which would impose a 30 percent income tax on American making over $1 million. While Stefanik hasn\u2019t officially come out against the Buffet Rule, her campaign is calling it a sham and says if Woolf is in favor of it, voters should know if he would abide by it. \u201cVoters should know that a candidate who\u2019s calling for higher taxes is going to be able to walk the walk. He has refused to do that,\u201d said Lenny Alcivar, Stefanik communications director.\n\nThere\u2019s a refreshing change for you. If Woolf is ready to have the rich \u201cpay their fair share\u201d he should be at the head of the line to do so himself, no? But in closing, since the Democrats are so interested in Ms. Stefanik\u2019s personal relationships, Hot Air has concluded their own in-depth investigation and I can report that Elise does in fact have a special someone in her life. And just to make things all the more salacious for the Woolf campaign\u2026 it\u2019s not even a guy. Her name is Nala, and her picture is below.\n\nHappy now? All you Democrats can run with that scoop. Just be sure to credit us for the story. Oh, and if any of you would care to kick in a couple of bucks to help Elise fight back against this kind of dirty pool, you can do so here.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Would you ask a man this?", "title": "Democrats very interested in female GOP candidate\u2019s \u201cpersonal relationships\u201d", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/09/14/democrats-very-interested-in-female-gop-candidates-personal-relationships/", "image": {"width": 500, "identifier": "http://media.hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/StefanikDog.jpg", "height": 398}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@JazzShaw"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "keywords": "2014 election, House of Representatives, New York,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-14T15:01:55+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-14T14:37:13+00:00"}, "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf2e1\"", "article_summary": "The Woolf campaign quickly tried to distance themselves from the letter, calling it, \u201creprehensible and antithetic\u201d to what his campaign is about.\nAnd just to make things all the more salacious for the Woolf campaign\u2026 it\u2019s not even a guy.\nThe party of the donkey has nominated self-funding millionaire film producer Aaron Woolf, while the Republicans have small businesswoman Elise Stefanik.\nPerhaps the Woolf campaign was just getting a little desperate.\nElise Stefanik is calling on Aaron Woolf to release his tax returns to the public."}
