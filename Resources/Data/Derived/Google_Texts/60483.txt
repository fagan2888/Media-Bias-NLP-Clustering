Authorities say a 16-year-old boy was killed when the all-terrain vehicle he was riding hit a tree near Topeka.

The Shawnee County Sheriff's Office says Justin Wyatt Branham died at a hospital shortly after the accident Wednesday afternoon.

Sheriff Herman Jones says Branham was wearing a helmet when the three-wheel ATV he was riding went into a ditch and hit the tree.

Funeral arrangements are pending.
