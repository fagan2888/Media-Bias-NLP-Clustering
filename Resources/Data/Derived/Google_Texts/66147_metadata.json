The question of whether a worker is an employee is based on the \u201ceconomic realities\u201d of the arrangement, with consideration of the following factors: (1) control of the worker\u2019s duties; (2) payment of wages; (3) right to hire, fire, and discipline; and (4) performance of the duties as an integral part of the employer\u2019s business toward achieving a common goal. The Attorney General opined that state law does not permit arrangements where a private entity trains and oversees the building official, provides all of the official\u2019s compensation and benefits, and retains authority to fire and replace the individual performing the building-official function.\n\n\n\nIn light of the Attorney General\u2019s opinion, municipalities that use a private contractor as the building official face a number of legal risks. For one, the Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs could initiate enforcement actions against it. Also, property owners could challenge a building official\u2019s decision if the official is unlawfully employed.\n\n\n\nMunicipalities have several options to comply with this new employment requirement. One cost-efficient option is to partner with neighboring communities to share a single building official. So long as the head building official is a municipal employee, the law permits private contractors to perform building-related services like inspections and plan reviews.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=237add8b-1491-4192-8034-989e71fd6cae", "image": "http://www.lexology.com/images/share/lexology-facebook.png", "description": "The Michigan Attorney General has interpreted a recent law requiring municipal building officials to be &quot;employed&quot; by a municipality to mean that\u2026", "title": "Employment requirements for building officials | Lexology"}, "Description": "The Michigan Attorney General has interpreted a recent law requiring municipal building officials to be &quot;employed&quot; by a municipality to mean that\u2026", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "USA November 17 2015The Michigan Attorney General has interpreted a recent law requiring municipal building officials to be \u201cemployed\u201d by a municipality to mean that building officials cannot be private independent contractors.\nAlso, property owners could challenge a building official\u2019s decision if the official is unlawfully employed.\nOne cost-efficient option is to partner with neighboring communities to share a single building official.\nSo long as the head building official is a municipal employee, the law permits private contractors to perform building-related services like inspections and plan reviews.\nIn light of the Attorney General\u2019s opinion, municipalities that use a private contractor as the building official face a number of legal risks."}
