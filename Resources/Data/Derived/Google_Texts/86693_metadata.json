I like to say that for the last 1,000 years, we've tamed environment, but we haven't tamed ourselves.\"\n\nMr Sethi explained that, for instance, those looking to lose weight could shock themselves when their plate was half finished, to encourage themselves to stop eating. Or if you knew that you wasted too much time on social media, you could shock yourself to snap your attention away from the device.\n\nHe told The Daily Dot website that while activating the Pavlok manually might sound counterproductive to the aim of the device, his team's research showed that self-applied shock is as \u2013 or more \u2013 effective than automated shock. Having the Pavlok on your wrist \"opens up the awareness of your habits,\" he claimed.\n\n\"It makes you ask yourself, wait, why am I hungry again?\"\n\nThe shock is delivered at two milliamperes, which the manufacturers claim is neither dangerous nor excessively painful. The device goes on sale next year for $244 (\u00a3155).\n\nAnd on their website, the company state: \"If there was one thing you could do, every day for a year, who would you become? Change is hard. We're held back by distractions, other people, and often ourselves.\n\n\"But change isn't impossible. Choose your daily action, and Pavlok will hold you accountable, ensuring lasting success.\"\n\nAn American journalist, EJ Dickinson, tested the bracelet last week for her family's Thanksgiving meal \u2013 activating the shock when she was tempted to have second helpings.\n\n\"Is a shock therapy wearable necessarily the healthiest way of preventing overeating, or even obsessive-compulsiveness? Probably not,\" she concluded.\n\n\"That said I'd be lying if I said it wasn't at least a little effective: Today, I was more than able to button each button of my trousers.\"", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "GSACategory": "worldnews", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03122/pavlok_3122497k.jpg"}, "site": "@Telegraph", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@h_alexander"}, "keywords": "pavlok, wristband, shock, therapy, habit, USA,North America,World News,News", "DCSext.cmsSect": "News;World_News;North_America;USA;Technology;Technology_News;Harriet_Alexander", "DCSext.Channel": "news", "DCSext.MLC": "/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa", "DCSext.Content_Type": "Story", "description": "An American company has created the Pavlok - an electric shock wristband that \n  has been designed to try and change bad habits", "WT.cg_n": "news", "title": "Want to avoid second helpings?
