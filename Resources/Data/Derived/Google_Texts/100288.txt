A Wichita woman cannot use her basement right now because her plumbing is clogged and sewage is spilling out on the floor.

Tracy Miller says she has not been able to flush the toilet, take a shower or do her dishes since Thursday after the sewer line in her rented property clogged up.

"I was sick last night from smelling this, but I had no choice but to lay up in this house...I have no where else to go," Miller said.

The landlord and Miller have been trying to get the plumbing fixed, although both the landlord and Miller say the other has not been overly helpful.

The law in Kansas says that landlords have to fix issues pertaining to health and safety. "Maintain in good and safe working order and condition all electrical, plumbing, sanitary, heating, ventilating and air-conditioning appliances including elevators, supplied or required to be supplied by such landlord," it reads in section K.S.A. 58-2553 of Kansas Law.

To better protect tenants from potential issues when they are looking at a rental home, the Kansas Tenants Handbook suggests that the potential renter look over the property; examine all the plumbing fixtures for leaks and make sure they function properly; and make sure that the drains work well and that there is no standing water that stays in the bottom of the sink.
