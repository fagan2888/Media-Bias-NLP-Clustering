More families moved out of Ohio than moved into the state last year, according to reports from three of the nation’s largest moving companies.

While each company’s records show only a small subset of all relocations across state lines, their annual reports offer a glimpse at interstate migration before the release of the U.S. Census Bureau’s yearly state-to-state migration data.

Ohio’s ratio of inbound to outbound moves ranked 44th of the 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia in the United Van Lines 2014 National Movers Study. United listed Ohio as a “High Outbound” state because more than 55 percent of the company’s 7,641 Ohio moves were outbound.

United reported 1,371 net outbound moves in Ohio during 2014. Of the 48 contiguous states, only New Jersey, Illinois and New York had a higher number of net outbound moves than Ohio.

“With Ohio’s middling job growth since 2011, it isn’t a surprise that people are voting with their feet by moving to states where opportunities exist and the path to prosperity isn’t so long,” Matt Mayer, president of free market think tank Opportunity Ohio, told Ohio Watchdog via email.

Ohio’s economy has added fewer than 300,000 jobs since January 2011, although the state lost 455,000 jobs from March 2006 through February 2010. For the first three quarters of 2014, Ohio’s job creation rate ranked 44th nationally.

In Opportunity Ohio’s most recent monthly Ohio Jobs Recovery report, Mayer projected Ohio would not likely recover to peak March 2000 employment levels until late 2020.

“I hope Governor (John) Kasich and the General Assembly now move beyond the re-election rhetoric and realize Ohio remains mired in high government spending, slow job growth and pro-union policies,” Mayer told Ohio Watchdog.

He added, “I wish Governor Kasich would fight as hard on issues like right-to-work and less government spending as he does for expanding Medicaid and hiking the severance tax. Ohio’s private sector employers and taxpayers sure could use his zeal where it really matters to them.”

Right-to-work laws protect the right of workers to choose whether to pay a union. Of the top 10 “High Inbound” states in United’s 2014 National Movers Study, seven were right-to-work states. Of United’s top 10 “High Outbound” states, only two were right-to-work states.

In the Atlas Van Lines 2014 Migration Patterns report, Ohio’s ratio of inbound to outbound moves ranked 45th of the 50 states; Ohio’s net migration ranked 48th of the 50 states.

Atlas completed 1,934 moves into Ohio and 2,707 moves out of Ohio, for a net of 773 outbound moves. Only Illinois and New York had more net outbound moves than Ohio.

Because more than 55 percent of all Atlas shipments in Ohio were outbound, Ohio was listed as one of 14 “Outbound” states. Ohio has been listed as an Outbound state in each of the past 10 annual Migration Patterns releases, and, at 59 percent outbound moves, is tied with New York for the highest percentage of outbound moves over the decade.

In the Allied Van Lines 2014 Magnet States Report, Ohio’s ratio of inbound to outbound moves ranked 37th of the contiguous states, D.C. and Alaska. With 344 net outbound moves, Ohio’s net migration ranked 42nd — a drop of one position from the previous year.

Allied moved 1,834 households into the state and 2,178 households out of the state last year.

Census Bureau findings later in the year consistent with the figures reported by United Van Lines, Atlas Van Lines and Allied Van Lines would represent the continuation of a negative trend, as Ohio has been losing population to other states for decades. Ohio has 16 seats in the U.S. House, compared to 24 seats in the 1960s.
