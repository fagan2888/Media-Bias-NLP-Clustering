Beresford, SD

Over 400 students and adults took part in the Frost Bite 4 road run. The event is a fundraiser for the Beresford Booster Club. Now in its fifteenth year the winter road race looks to create some outdoor fun even despite the cold temps.

“We've kind of built it into a celebration of wellness and a celebration in the dead of winter to get outside and do thinks that maybe people normally do in the summer time,” Frostbite 4 Organizer Kevin Nelson said.

Participants had the choice of a four mile run or a two mile run/walk. The course of the race is determined the morning of the event so racers can run with the wind.
