Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker has rejected a labor group’s effort to increase the state’s $7.25 an hour minimum wage.

The Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel reports that a coalition led by the group Wisconsin Jobs Now had seized on a provision in Wisconsin law which states that the minimum wage must be a “living wage” – defined as “reasonable comfort, reasonable physical well-being, decency and moral well-being.” However, the Journal-Sentinel noted, state law also allows governors to weigh such factors as the wage’s impact on the labor market. (Studies show that state increases in the minimum wage don’t harm job growth.)

Citing the living wage provision, the coalition last month urged the Walker administration’s labor department to raise the state’s minimum wage. In rebuffing the effort, the Walker administration isn’t just citing the other factors a governor is allowed to consider – it’s actually asserting that $7.25 an hour is a living wage.

Responding to the coalition’s effort in a letter Monday, Robert Rodriguez of the Department of Workforce Development wrote, “The department has determined that there is no reasonable cause to believe that the wages paid to the complainants are not a living wage.”

As ThinkProgress’ Bryce Covert notes, an MIT study has found that a living wage for a single parent in Madison, Wisconsin would be $21.17 per hour.
