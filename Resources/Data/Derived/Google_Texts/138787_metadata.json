(AP) - Colin Kaepernick is in the process of considering how he might go about his offseason regimen to bounce back from a disappointing year, and employing a mechanics coach or quarterback guru as Tom Brady and other stars have done is being discussed.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s still in the works,\u201d Kaepernick said. \u201cJust working on possibilities right now.\u201d\n\nSan Francisco (7-8) looks to avoid a losing record when it ends the season Sunday at home against Arizona (11-4), which still has a shot at winning the NFC West.\n\nKaepernick, rewarded with a hefty new contract in June before training camp, has shined under former NFL quarterback and coach Jim Harbaugh until this up-and-down year. He has cost the team games, and San Francisco heads into the season finale on a four-game losing streak - the first under fourth-year coach Harbaugh, who is likely on his way out.\n\nKaepernick is 274 for 452 for 3,165 yards and 17 touchdowns with 10 interceptions and 43 sacks. Perhaps the most glaring flaw has been San Francisco\u2019s failure to score second-half points, including only 37 in the last nine games.\n\nThe Niners blew a 28-7 halftime lead in a 38-35 overtime loss to San Diego last Saturday.\n\nHe said once the season ends he will go back through each game film and begin the self-evaluation process, something that can be difficult to do during the season amid the challenge of game-planning from week to week.\n\n\u201cYou still watch mechanics, what you can do better, but it\u2019s more of a week-to-week basis. It\u2019s hard to break habits in season. You don\u2019t want to completely try to change something because it can throw off everything else you\u2019re doing,\u201d Kaepernick said. \u201cI\u2019ll be able to figure those things out, what I need to get better at.\u201d\n\nOne of the NFL\u2019s most dynamic young playcallers coming into the year, Kaepernick received a $126 million, six-year contract extension through the 2020 season. Both the 49ers and their star wanted to strike a deal before training camp.\n\nHarbaugh is all for quarterbacks receiving some outside help during the offseason to improve themselves, as New England star Brady, New Orleans\u2019 Drew Brees and Denver\u2019s QB Peyton Manning do.\n\n\u201cYeah, there\u2019s value there. Quarterbacks are always trying to improve their play and find something,\u201d Harbaugh said. \u201cFind one thing or find two things to help them, to get better. Colin\u2019s always been that type of player that is looking for improvement for those two months that are after the season. He likes to, the way they don\u2019t come into the facility, but his car is in the lot the next day. He\u2019s very shortly plotting out his offseason regiment. He takes no time off and gets right to work. So, it\u2019s expected he would find anything, even one or two things to try to improve his play. That\u2019s the kind of guy he is.\u201d\n\nHarbaugh recommended former pitching coach Tom House to then-49ers QB Alex Smith - now leading Kansas City - at one point and Smith spent time with House during the spring of 2012 refining his mechanics.\n\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s something we set up, facilitated, and thought it had good results,\u201d Harbaugh said, noting how much things have changed since his playing days. \u201cI think the principle\u2019s the same. You\u2019re always seeking out ways to improve - do anything, willing to do anything to get better, to improve.\u201d\n\nNOTES: The 49ers took the day off completely Thursday for Christmas after playing a Saturday game last week against San Diego, with plans to reunite Friday for final preparations ahead of Sunday\u2019s regular-season finale.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Colin Kaepernick is in the process of considering how he might go about his offseason regimen to bounce back from a disappointing year, and employing a mechanics coach or quarterback guru as Tom Brady and other stars have done is being discussed.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Colin Kaepernick is in the process of considering how he might go about his offseason regimen to bounce back from a disappointing year, and employing a mechanics coach or quarterback guru as Tom Brady and other stars have done is being discussed.", "title": "Colin Kaepernick weighing his offseason approach", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/dec/25/colin-kaepernick-weighing-his-offseason-approach/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/23/chargers-49ers-footballjpeg-0abb2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/23/chargers-49ers-footballjpeg-0abb2.jpg", "description": "Colin Kaepernick is in the process of considering how he might go about his offseason regimen to bounce back from a disappointing year, and employing a mechanics coach or quarterback guru as Tom Brady", "card": "summary", "title": "Colin Kaepernick weighing his offseason approach"}, "Author": "JANIE McCAULEY", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Colin Kaepernick, Jim Harbaugh, San Diego, San Francisco"}, "article_summary": "You don\u2019t want to completely try to change something because it can throw off everything else you\u2019re doing,\u201d Kaepernick said.\nKaepernick, rewarded with a hefty new contract in June before training camp, has shined under former NFL quarterback and coach Jim Harbaugh until this up-and-down year.\nKaepernick is 274 for 452 for 3,165 yards and 17 touchdowns with 10 interceptions and 43 sacks.\nHe has cost the team games, and San Francisco heads into the season finale on a four-game losing streak - the first under fourth-year coach Harbaugh, who is likely on his way out.\nSo, it\u2019s expected he would find anything, even one or two things to try to improve his play."}
