Auricchio Buys Cheese Importer Ambriola

The buyer makes gorgonzola, mascarpone, ricotta salata, pecorino romano, permigiano reggiano and other cheeses

Auricchio SpA has acquired New Jersey-based cheese importer the Ambriola Co., buying a distribution channel.

Ambriola, headquartered in West Caldwell, New Jersey, imports and distributes specialty Italian cheese and prosciutto di parma. The company is the sole importer of both Auricchio provolone and Locatelli brand cheese, which are made by the buyer. Ambriola will continue to operate in New Jersey. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. The transaction will give the target the ability to sell more types of cheese that Auricchio makes, says Ambriola CEO Phil Marfuggi.

Cremona, Italy-based Auricchio makes cheese, including gorgonzola, taleggio, quartirolo, mascarpone, ricotta salata, sheep's milk cheese, pecorino romano, permigiano reggiano and other cheeses, at seven manufacturing plants in Italy.

The deal follows many other food-related transactions. In January, Hershey agreed to buy jerky brand Krave, and in February, Ronnoco Coffee LLC bought U.S. Roasterie.
