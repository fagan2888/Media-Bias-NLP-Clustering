As goalie for the Avalanche, Roy finished with 551 NHL victories. With the Broncos, Manning recently threw his 503rd NFL touchdown pass. Which feat in our city\u2019s unique, elite 500 club is more impressive?\n\nHooch: Manning will become the all-time TD leader soon with 509\u2014 Roy isn\u2019t even the all-time wins leader ( second to Martin Brodeur). And what complements Manning\u2019s touchdown greatness is his lack of interceptions. Brett Favre had 508 TDs and 336 INTs, while Manning has thrown 222 picks, with 28 coming in his rookie season. Advantage, Peyton.\n\nKiz: No disrespect to the incredible Mr. Manning, but I can\u2019t hear you, Ben. The Stanley Cup rings of Roy are plugging my ears. You play to win the game. So when you compare 551 victories versus 503 TDs? It\u2019s no contest. Advantage, Roy.\n\nHooch: Oh, by the way, Peyton also missed an entire season! He had thrown 33 TDs in each of the two seasons before his injury, so let\u2019s say he would\u2019ve tossed 33 in 2011. The math says that by the middle of next season, he\u2019d be the only member of the 600-TD club!\n\nKiz: I respect and admire Manning\u2019s work for the Broncos. But I absolutely love what Roy did for the Avs. The championship history of the Avalanche can\u2019t be written without Roy. But here\u2019s the truth: When I look at Manning, I still see him as an Indianapolis Colt dressed in Broncos clothing.\n\nHooch: Not only is Roy an icon in Denver, he\u2019s part of the coolest thing in Denver sports history \u2014 the split Avs and Rockies No. 33 jersey that says ROYKER. Saint Patrick is on our city\u2019s sports Mount Rushmore (along with John Elway, Todd Helton and Danny Schayes). But when it comes to the battle of the 500 fellows, I\u2019ll take the Colt in orange.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "What\u2019s more impressive: 500 touchdown passes by Peyton Manning or 500 wins by Patrick Roy?", "title": "What\u2019s more impressive: 500 touchdown passes by Peyton Manning or 500 wins by Patrick Roy?", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/10/11/whats-more-impressive-500-touchdown-passes-by-peyton-manning-or-500-wins-by-patrick-roy/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141005__manning-cardinalsp1-2.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141005__manning-cardinalsp1-2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-10-12T01:10:28+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T21:51:00+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd5cca\"", "article_summary": "He had thrown 33 TDs in each of the two seasons before his injury, so let\u2019s say he would\u2019ve tossed 33 in 2011.\nKiz: Peyton Manning and Patrick Roy both began the second act of a legendary sports career in Denver.\nWith the Broncos, Manning recently threw his 503rd NFL touchdown pass.\nHooch: Manning will become the all-time TD leader soon with 509\u2014 Roy isn\u2019t even the all-time wins leader ( second to Martin Brodeur).\nBrett Favre had 508 TDs and 336 INTs, while Manning has thrown 222 picks, with 28 coming in his rookie season."}
