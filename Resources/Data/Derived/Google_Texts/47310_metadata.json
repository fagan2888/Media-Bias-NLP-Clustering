Ted Cruz talks on his mobile phone after he announced his candidacy for president during an event at Liberty College in Lynchburg, Va., March 23, 2015. (REUTERS/Chris Keane)\n\n4629051\n\nAs his book title suggests, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) says he wants to get some things off his chest in his new tome A Time For Truth. Who better to get honest about than the news media?\n\nBut before you get too excited about yet another politician ripping on a reporter for allegedly being a pawn of one of his political enemies, try using a loose interpretation of the word \u201chonest\u201d where Cruz\u2019s explanation is concerned.\n\nSpecifically, he blasts Politico\u2018s Manu Raju, whom he doesn\u2019t cite by name, WaPo\u2018s Bob Woodward and the Wall Street Journal. The story he references is by Raju, making it easy to figure out who Cruz is blasting.\n\nThe presidential hopeful employs one of the worsts accusations he can make about a reporter \u2014 he refers to Raju as Sen. Mitch McConnell\u2018s (R-Ky.) flack. Oddly, before the book was released, Manu had never received any complaints about his work concerning the senator. Was Cruz just storing up fresh outrage for his book?\n\n\u201cThe Republican leadership\u2019s attacks are amplified and made more effective by using friendly media outlets. When leadership is displeased, they place hit pieces with journalists only too happy to cooperate. Indeed, so much so that one particular Politico reporter often seems like he is Mitch McConnell\u2019s press secretary; nearly every attack from leadership gets echoed and amplified in his stories. As this reporter noted after one Senate lunch (apparently without irony): \u2018The closed\u2010door [Senate lunches] are supposed to be private . . . so senators interviewed for this article asked not to be named.'\u201d\n\nRaju\u2019s editor Mike Zapler stands by his reporter\u2019s work.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re proud of Manu\u2019s reporting and believe there\u2019s no one better at ferreting out information on the Senate,\u201d Zapler told The Mirror in a quote that he also gave to Breitbart\u2018s Matthew Boyle. \u201cWe\u2019d also point out that Senator Cruz writes in his book about the same closed-door spats that Manu detailed in real time, so their accuracy apparently is not in dispute.\u201d\n\nBoyle, not surprisingly, sided with Cruz. Oh, is he is flack? (Of course, not everyone can help tuck Cruz\u2019s children into bed.)\n\nIn Cruz\u2019s mind, Raju may act like McConnell\u2019s press secretary, but sources tell The Mirror that McConnell\u2019s office doesn\u2019t likely share his view considering the anger that has come with some of the stories he\u2019s written about him.\n\nCuriously, Cruz has passed around Raju\u2019s stories like candy. Oh, were some stories actually useful to him then? The headline on the release: \u201cICYMI: Sen. Cruz in POLITICO: Best Approach to King v. Burwell Is to Allow States to Opt Out.\u201d See the full story that shined a light on Cruz fighting his own party on Obamacare.\n\nBut bashing the media is a national pastime \u2014 gutting a reporter is great fun for Cruz.\n\n\u201cHe cites anonymous quotes but those were not all from Politico stories,\u201d said a source familiar with Politico congressional coverage. \u201cIn fact if you go back and look, many stories Politico has written about Cruz and his party include lots of on the record quotes from senators. He conveniently leaves that out of his book. \u2026The irony here is Cruz is using the fights with his party leadership \u2013 which Politico\u2019s Raju has covered extensively \u2013 as a basis of his campaign. \u201d\n\nThe press secretary accusation doesn\u2019t really hold up. Not if you look at the stories that Raju has written about McConnell and the effect they\u2019ve had. Was Cruz taking a nap on the days those were published?\n\nTake this bad news story for McConnell for days in the heat of election season last year since it was viewed as undermining his campaign message of getting Washington working under GOP leadership.\n\nDemocrats jumped all over it and McConnell got blowback.\n\nIn 2015, Raju wrote extensively about McConnell mishandling the Homeland Security Department spending fight. The coverage showed the Senate under his stewardship was in complete disarray.\n\nThis story most definitely didn\u2019t please McConnell\u2019s press office \u2014 in fact, quite the opposite. He\u2019d just been sworn into office and was on a high, taking a victory lap. Raju wrote about McConnell breaking some of his promises for regular order \u2014 hardly the act of a \u201cpress secretary.\u201d\n\nThere was also this story, which highlighted McConnell\u2019s close relationship with a benefactor \u2014 the founder of Humana \u2014 and doing favors for him on Capitol Hill.\n\nAnd there was this story about how McConnell was avoiding tough votes and forcing other Republicans to be sacrificial lambs \u2014 not exactly a profile in courage. A few lines in the story: \u201cMcConnell\u2019s leadership team has taken the safe route by opposing these bipartisan proposals\u2026 Some think the leadership is ducking the tough votes and allowing the rank-and-file to shoulder the burden.\u201d\n\nBut Politico\u2018s Raju isn\u2019t Cruz\u2019s only punching bag. The senator also takes several swings at the WSJ and one big one at something Woodward said on one of the Sunday shows.\n\n\u201cOf all the friendly media outlets for GOP leadership, none is more potent than the editorial page of the Wall Street Journal. \u2026Whenever congressional leadership is particularly exercised on a topic, it usually takes about seventy\u2010two hours for the Journal edi\u2010 torial page to unleash that same attack in the most important space in journalism.\u201d\n\nWhat seems to irk Cruz most is when media reports negatively impact his bank account.\n\n\u201cAs intended, this double [WSJ] hit in the press had its effect\u2014especially in the business and donor community. It was here where I made a mistake\u2014I didn\u2019t realize how effective the media attacks, especially in the conservative media, would be. Over and over again, I had to explain myself to people who usually were on our side, especially because the attacks from supposed Republican allies often inverted what was actually happening.\u201d\n\nThe senator grew absolutely incensed when Woodward appeared on TV and said, \u201cMitch McConnell thinks that Cruz is literally the most selfish senator he\u2019s ever seen.\u201d\n\nWatch how many times Cruz uses the word \u201cselfish.\u201d (The boldings are mine.)\n\n\u201cThere was almost a Freudian projection at work here. It seems to me that the \u2018selfish\u2018 thing for me to have done would have been to go along to get along: go to the Washington parties, raise money, stay in office for life, and never rock the boat. Who in their right mind would \u2018selfishly\u2018 choose to endure the vilification, the personal and nasty attacks? In the curious lexicon of Washington, what is perceived as \u2018selfish\u2018 is doing what you said you would do: honoring your commitments to your constituents. Because, I suppose, that selfishly makes it uncomfortable for others who do not wish to do the same.\u201d\n\nCruz must be an angel. He said he never plays the game and never plants nasty stories about his colleagues.\n\n\u201cThe typical Washington response would be for me to fight back, to fight fire with fire. To insult my colleagues, to plant nasty sto ries and give anonymous quotes smearing those on the other side. But I\u2019m not willing to play that game. It\u2019s wrong, and it\u2019s not what Texans elected me to do.\u201d\n\nLawmakers like Cruz attacking the media are a dime a dozen.
