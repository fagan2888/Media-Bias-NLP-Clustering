The non-profit group is affiliated with the Church of Scientology, which has long been at odds with the field of psychiatry.\n\n\"Think psychiatry has nothing to do with you? Think again.\"- video at Clearwater museum critical of psychiatry\n\nAnd both in words and tone, the videos portray mental-health practitioners and drugs as dangerous to patients and costly to society.\n\nAn introductory video intones over a dramatic soundtrack: \u201cThink psychiatry has nothing to do with you? Think again,\u201d it says. \u201cThe whole field of psychiatry has gotten into every facet of your life.\u201d\n\nThe museum consists of a series of cubicles bathed in soft lighting, with large-screen TVs that show what sponsors call \u201cmini-documentaries\u201d on topics such as alleged over-drugging of soldiers, children and the elderly.\n\nSome cover the early history of psychiatry, which Scientology considers \u201cbrutal pseudoscience.\u201d The use of leeches, lobotomies and asylums gradually gave way to a multibillion-dollar drug industry that may seem more civilized but is just as abusive, according to the exhibits.\n\nThe museum is modeled after one of the same name at the Los Angeles headquarters of the Citizens Commission on Human Rights. A CCHR press release says that nearly 200,000 visitors have toured the original.\n\nOn the videos at the Clearwater museum, people talk about being hurt by the mental-health system \u2013 labeled with a mental illness, drugged into a stupor, or held against their will in institutions.\n\nSome professionals interviewed on screen also offer strong denunciation of mainstream psychiatrists.\n\n\u201cThey basically believe that everyone is mentally ill,\u201d said American University psychology professor Jeffrey Schaler.\n\nPsychiatrist Thomas Szasz, co-founder of the Citizens Commission on Human Rights and author of \u201cThe Myth of Mental Illness,\u201d died in 2012. But his image lives on in the museum, chiding colleagues for turning every human failing into a treatment opportunity.\n\n\u201cYou smoke too much, it\u2019s a disease,\u201d Szasz says on-screen. \u201cYou\u2019re too unhappy it\u2019s a disease. You\u2019re too thin, it\u2019s a disease. You\u2019re too fat, it\u2019s a disease.\u201d\n\nThe condemnations pile on, challenging the reliability of psychiatric diagnosis and claiming that nothing about psychiatry is legitimate and \u201cthey\u2019re billing for it.\u201d\n\n\"It's all fraud.\" - Dr. Ron Leifer, a psychiatrist and critic of mainstream psychiatry\n\n\u201cThere is not one shred of evidence that any respectable scientist would consider valid demonstrating that anything that psychiatrists call mental illness are brain diseases or biochemical imbalances,\" said Dr. Ron Leifer, a psychiatrist in Ithica, New York and a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Szasz. \u201cIt\u2019s all fraud.\u201d\n\nHealth News Florida asked several national mental-health organizations to review the videos and offer opinions on whether they were accurate, but all declined. Scientology has a reputation for issuing legal threats to those who criticize its work.\n\nOne researcher willing to talk about the materials is Stephen Kent, a sociologist at the University of Alberta who studies new religions. With a co-author, he wrote an extensive review of Scientology\u2019s battle against psychiatry that appeared in November 2012 in PubMed and was updated in January 2014.\n\nKent says that the late L. Ron Hubbard, who founded Scientology after writing the book \u201cDianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health,\u201d hoped that Dianetics would replace psychiatry. That didn\u2019t happen.\n\n\u201cIt just evoked scorn,\u201d Kent said. \u201cBy 1969, Hubbard had become so frustrated he went to war against the mental health professions.\u201d\n\nKent said CCHR\u2019s materials on psychiatry make some valid points about early mistakes in psychiatric treatment and about today\u2019s pop-a-pill culture. But the group fails to give appropriate credit for recent advances in diagnosis and treatment of severe mental illness.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll never see, never, a single word of praise for psychiatry in CCHR,\u201d Kent said.\n\nThe drug industry comes in for equal criticism; in fact, several videos at the Clearwater museum suggest prescription drugs for anxiety, depression and other ills may be to blame for mass murders.\n\nWhile the viewer sees footage and hears sound from scenes of indiscriminate slaughter, the screen flashes with the name of the shooter and the drugs he was prescribed.\n\nViewers may surmise that the drugs were the cause of the violent behavior. But Kent, the Canadian researcher, said that conclusion is unwarranted.\n\nIt could be that the drugs were prescribed but never taken, he said, or the patient may have taken the drugs but stopped abruptly rather than tapering, causing him to spiral out of control.\n\nKent added another possibility: Severely depressed people who lacked the energy to act on violent urges got their energy back when placed on medication but did not gain other benefits.\n\n\u201cThe issue of psychiatric drugs causing violence is important and complicated,\u201d Kent said. \u201cThe mere fact that a person (who commits violent acts) had been treated by a psychiatrist doesn\u2019t mean the treatment was a factor in the violence.\u201d\n\nWhile negative side effects to drugs are a concern, Kent said, \u201cIt\u2019s certainly not the case that psychiatric drugs cause people to become mass killers.\u201d\n\n\" It is certainly not the case that psychiatric drugs cause people to become mass killers.\" - professor Stephen Kent\n\nCCHR\u2019s Florida director Diane Stein said a lot of people have come by to see the Clearwater museum and that she hopes to arrange tours by civic and school groups. No one visited the museum during the weekday afternoon a Health News Florida reporter was there.\n\nStein said the museum is just one facet of CCHR\u2019s activities.\n\nAnother is lobbying for public-policy issues on mental health in the Legislature. Still another is offering a hotline to advise callers of their rights on involuntary treatment, she said.\n\nAlso, CCHR investigates accusations of human rights abuses, Stein said. She cited several cases in which state disciplinary actions were brought against psychiatrists because of CCHR\u2019s work.\n\nWayne Hilton of Tampa doesn't agree with the group's message at the museum because of what happened to his son. The boy began hearing voices at the age of 15; he developed fears that Nazis were taking over the world.\n\n\u201cHe was trapped in his delusions, he couldn\u2019t get out,\u201d Hilton said.\n\nHilton sought help for his son at the Hillsborough Mental Health Crisis Center, where the boy was given medication for anxiety, Hilton said.\n\nLater, at St. Joseph\u2019s Children\u2019s Hospital in Tampa, the teenager got a thorough work-up, diagnosis of early-onset schizophrenia, and drugs appropriate for that diagnosis. He\u2019s been stable for 2 \u00bd years, Hilton said.\n\nSo it makes him sad to see CCHR call psychiatry an \u201cindustry of death.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey saved my son\u2019s life,\u201d Hilton said. \u201cI guarantee you if we had not gotten my son to the right hospital, to the right psychiatrist, to the right medication, he would not be alive today. There\u2019s no doubt in my mind.\u201d\n\nCCHR\u2019s Stein said that she thinks her group and those who see value in current mental-health treatment and drugs can find common ground. All disagree with putting sick people in jail, and want to see them get help.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not opposed to treatment, we\u2019re opposed to what is considered treatment,\u201d she said, offering as examples electroshock therapy, drugs with side effects that can be dangerous, and the increasing incidence of prescribing psychoactive drugs to children and the elderly just to keep them quiet.\n\nAs Stein put it, \u201cWhy are we tolerating the drugging of our society?\u201d\n\nCarol Gentry is a special correspondent for WUSF in Tampa.
