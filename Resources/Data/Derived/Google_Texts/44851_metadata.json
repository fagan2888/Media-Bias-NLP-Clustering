According to the indictment, D\u2019Souza, in support of his college friend\u2019s challenge to Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, had attempted to circumvent the $5,000 limit for individual donations by having other friends of his donate, too, and then reimbursing them later. It may be the low point of D\u2019Souza\u2019s life and career.\n\nWe say \u201cmay be\u201d rather than \u201cdefinitely is\u201d because of the simple fact that, for much of the past two years, D\u2019Souza\u2019s time on this planet has been filled with ignominy and failure. As the Daily Beast\u2019s David Sessions notes, D\u2019Souza went from riding high on the success of his very profitable (and racist) \u201cdocumentary\u201d \u2014 \u201c2016: Obama\u2019s America\u201d \u2014 to being forced to resign as president of King\u2019s College, an evangelical school in New York City after becoming engaged with one woman while he was still married to another.\n\nYet even \u201c2016\u201d would come to bring D\u2019Souza trouble. David Sain, the producer of the film, ultimately sued D\u2019Souza, claiming the pundit had done a poor job managing the movie\u2019s finances and had also kept producers and other stakeholders in the dark when it was time to make decisions about distribution and marketing. The lawsuit was eventually tossed by a judge, but the blemish on what was previously an absolute success was yet another bump on D\u2019Souza\u2019s as of late very rocky road.", "article_metadata": {"description": "How the once-celebrated right-wing author managed to blow up his life and career in little more than two years", "title": "The rapid decline of Dinesh D\u2019Souza", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "How the once-celebrated right-wing author managed to blow up his life and career in little more than two years", "title": "The rapid decline of Dinesh D\u2019Souza", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/01/24/the_rapid_decline_of_dinesh_dsouza/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/dinesh_dsouza.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "How the once-celebrated right-wing author managed to blow up his life and career in little more than two years", "title": "The rapid decline of Dinesh D\u2019Souza", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/dinesh_dsouza.jpg", "creator": "@eliasisquith", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Elias Isquith", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2016: Obama's America, David Sessions, Dinesh Dsouza, Indictment, King's College, The Daily Beast", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdced1\"", "article_summary": "Topics: 2016: Obama's America, David Sessions, Dinesh Dsouza, Indictment, King's College, The Daily Beast, Media News, Politics NewsDinesh D\u2019Souza, the right-wing author, pundit and filmmaker, was indicted Thursday night for campaign finance fraud.\nYet even \u201c2016\u201d would come to bring D\u2019Souza trouble.\nThe lawsuit was eventually tossed by a judge, but the blemish on what was previously an absolute success was yet another bump on D\u2019Souza\u2019s as of late very rocky road.\nIt may be the low point of D\u2019Souza\u2019s life and career.\nAccording to the indictment, D\u2019Souza, in support of his college friend\u2019s challenge to Sen.
