She\u2019d just lost her job after having a lumpectomy to remove an aggressive form of breast cancer. She was scheduled to start chemotherapy in a few days but no longer had health insurance. As a housekeeper earning a low wage, there was no way she could afford the expensive chemo and radiation treatments that her doctor had ordered.\n\nProstran also wasn\u2019t a native English speaker, so it fell to her daughter, Sladjana Cadjo, to find help. Stressed over her mother\u2019s situation, Cadjo finally got a phone call that gave her some hope. She was told to come to a local hospital and fill out a simple, one-page form.\n\nA few days later, Cadjo learned that her mother had been approved for Medicaid. All of her cancer treatments would be covered.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s basically like they came to us and said, \u2018Here\u2019s a $1 million check,\u2019\u201d Cadjo says. \u201cThat\u2019s how I\u2019m looking at it.\u201d\n\nProstran\u2019s good fortune wouldn\u2019t have happened without Every Woman\u2019s Life, a federally funded program that provides breast and cervical screenings for low-income, uninsured or underinsured women ages 40- 64. An additional state grant offers similar services to younger women (ages 18-39) who are experiencing symptoms of possible breast or cervical cancer.\n\nWomen who are diagnosed with breast or cervical cancer through Every Woman\u2019s Life qualify to apply for Medicaid services and receive an accelerated decision. Most find out if they qualify within 10 business days, which is much faster than the usual waiting period.\n\nBased on U.S. census data, there are more than 200,000 women ages 18-64 in Virginia who are eligible for the services. Unfortunately, there\u2019s only enough funding to serve around 7,600, or about 3 percent, of the eligible population each year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very high demand,\u201d says Carrie Schaeffer, social worker at Henrico Doctors\u2019 Hospital\u2019s Cancer Center. \u201cIn Virginia, we do not have any Medicaid expansion, so there are still thousands of people who are unable to afford health insurance even through the Affordable Care Act. They\u2019re living paycheckto paycheck, if they even have a paycheck.\n\n\u201cJust a mammogram itself is $150, and that\u2019s just a screening mammogram,\u201d she continues. \u201cIf they need any more than that, it becomes unaffordable.\u201d\n\nEvery Woman\u2019s Life partners with 29 enrollment sites, including health systems, health departments and clinics, around the state. In Richmond, the program is available through HCA and Bon Secours hospitals. All partners are reimbursed for the services they provide via federal and state funding.\n\nMany of the women who qualify fall within a service gap. They make too much money to directly qualify for Medicaid services, but not enough to afford health insurance coverage through the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cThese are women who otherwise wouldn\u2019t have access to a regular mammogram or pap smear,\u201d explains Christina Benton, cancer control supervisor at the Virginia Department of Health. \u201cThe goal is to detect cancer as early as possible so we can have better outcomes to treatment.\u201d\n\nAnd for those women who are diagnosed and find themselves in dire financial situations like Prostran, Every Woman\u2019s Life provides an accelerated path to treatment that\u2019s paid for jointly by the federal and state governments.\n\n\u201cIf a woman has a diagnosis of cervical or breast cancer, we can help her apply for expedited Medicaid to help pay for her treatment,\u201d Schaeffer says. \u201cWithout [Every Woman\u2019s Life], we wouldn\u2019t be able to get those women into the Medicaid program.\u201d\n\nBon Secours Richmond is the largest provider of the program\u2019s services in the Richmond area. There are seven clinics a month offered at six different facilities around the region, including Chesterfield\u2019s St. Francis Medical Center and St. Francis Watkins Centre.\n\n\u201cWe offer them different times of the day, and we also offer a Saturday clinic for women who work or have transportation issues,\u201d says Berkeleigh Combs, Bon Secours\u2019 EWL project supervisor. \u201cWe also give them a $10 gas card to help with transportation. It encourages them to get those preventative screenings.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been amazed by how many women do not get their annual screening mammogram,\u201d Combs continues. \u201cJust since \u2026 April, we\u2019ve had a couple of women who don\u2019t have health insurance who have been diagnosed with breast cancer, so it\u2019s very important. We try to inform and educate that we are available.\u201d\n\nFor Cadjo, the Every Woman\u2019s Life program means that her mother will get the treatment she needs. Prostran will start radiation therapy this month.\n\nObviously, it\u2019s a taxing time for the family, but one thing they won\u2019t have to worry about is how to pay for cancer treatment.\n\n\u201cCan you imagine the stress level, knowing you\u2019re going for all that [treatment], but nothing is covered?\u201d Cadjo asks. \u201cWhat they did for us is a lifesaver.\u201d\n\nDo you qualify?\n\nTo be eligible for Every Woman\u2019s Life services, women must be 18-64 years of age (women ages 18-39 must be symptomatic for breast or cervical cancer), reside in Virginia, have an income at or less than 200 percent of the Federal Poverty Level and have limited or no health insurance.
