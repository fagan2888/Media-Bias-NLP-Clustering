The man has an appreciation for greatness.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about the Orange Crush,\u201d Ware, a 33-year-old outside linebacker, said Thursday. \u201cWe always talk about that.\u201d\n\nThe start of a new season offers the Broncos a chance to erase the memory of their playoff loss to the Indianapolis Colts last winter. An opportunity to rinse away the lasting bitterness of the Super Bowl debacle in the 2013 season. And, with coordinator Wade Phillips in the driver\u2019s seat, a new vision for the defense.\n\nThe Broncos have converted to a 3-4 alignment defensively, just as they did in 1976 before their terrific 1977 season that produced the Orange Crush nickname.\n\nThe 1977 Broncos allowed only 10.6 points and 109.4 yards rushing per game (fewest in the NFL), while recovering 14 fumbles by opponents and making 25 interceptions.\n\nThe 2014 Broncos, playing a 4-3 defense, allowed an average of 22.1 points (tied for 16th in the NFL), while recovering seven fumbles by opponents and making 18 interceptions. They set a franchise record for fewest yards rushing allowed per game (79.8), but that figure lived in a vacuum.\n\nThe 1977 Broncos rode their defense to Super Bowl XII. The 2014 Broncos lost their playoff opener.\n\n\u201cYou think about the championship teams \u2014 they have a great offense,\u201d Ware said. \u201cBut defense always wins championships.\u201d\n\nIt starts with the three on the line, whose roles have already been in flux but whose responsibilities increase in the 3-4.\n\nTerrance Knighton\u2019s departure paved the way for Sylvester Williams to anchor the defensive line. The 6-foot-2, 313-pound nose tackle is the powerhouse clogging the middle and commanding double-team blocks to clear space for the linebackers to make tackles.\n\nIt\u2019s the guys around him who could change, at least temporarily. Derek Wolfe, a fourth-year defensive end, was suspended four games for violating the NFL\u2019s performance-enhancement drug policy. Malik Jackson, among the Broncos\u2019 most efficient defensive players, suffered a strained calf and has been limited early at training camp.\n\nAnd veteran Antonio Smith, who missed most of the offseason workouts because of a criminal allegation in Texas, is back with the team but not physically ready to take the field.\n\nIn the meantime, Vance Walker has been given more reps \u2014 most at defensive end, some at nose tackle \u2014 to display his versatility. Kenny Anunike, the smallest of Denver\u2019s defensive linemen at 272 pounds, has already impressed, creating a couple of highlight-reel pass deflections during OTAs.\n\nBut perhaps the key to the Broncos\u2019 historic mission is the health of inside linebackers Brandon Marshall and Danny Trevathan \u2014 and the continued progress of their backups, Todd Davis and Steven Johnson.\n\n\u201cYou have to have \u2018backers that can also take on the blockers and be able to flow because there\u2019s a blocker that comes up on you fast,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cYou have to have guys with good instincts.\u201d\n\nWare and the rest of the Broncos\u2019 defense are hoping those instincts propel them to records and beyond \u2014 a Super Bowl victory.\n\nNot long after Ware\u2019s declaration Thursday, former Denver linebacker Tom Jackson returned to Broncos Country, where he once wreaked havoc on opponents. But this time the Ring of Famer and staple of the 1977 team was one of the many reporters who would be parked on the sideline of the team\u2019s practice facility during training camp.\n\nWaiting and watching to see if Denver\u2019s retooled defense will resemble his former wrecking crew.\n\nNicki Jhabvala: njhabvala@denverpost.com or twitter.com/nickijhabvala", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Broncos hoping switch to 3-4 defense creates another Orange Crush", "title": "Broncos hoping switch to 3-4 defense creates another Orange Crush", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/08/02/broncos-hoping-switch-to-3-4-defense-creates-another-orange-crush/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150802__BN20150803_B1_BNSP03FBNBRONXp2.jpg", "height": 456}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150802__BN20150803_B1_BNSP03FBNBRONXp2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-02T20:50:21+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T06:32:52+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0e36\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIt\u2019s all about the Orange Crush,\u201d Ware, a 33-year-old outside linebacker, said Thursday.\nThe Broncos have converted to a 3-4 alignment defensively, just as they did in 1976 before their terrific 1977 season that produced the Orange Crush nickname.\nForget for a moment that DeMarcus Ware wasn\u2019t even alive \u2014 and wouldn\u2019t be for another five years \u2014 when the Orange Crush reigned.\nThe 1977 Broncos rode their defense to Super Bowl XII.\n\u201cYou have to have guys with good instincts.\u201dWare and the rest of the Broncos\u2019 defense are hoping those instincts propel them to records and beyond \u2014 a Super Bowl victory."}
