To the leftist mind, the heart of conservatives\u2019 non-\u201cprogressive\u201d views on matters such as immigration reform and climate change is a deep-seated effort to suppress women in one way or another.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at ten top examples:\n\n1. Pro-life Measures\n\nAbortion-related legislation on both the federal and state levels is sure to cause an outburst of war-on-women claims, whether it\u2019s putting forth a 20-week ban, defunding Planned Parenthood, or enforcing stricter regulation of clinics. For example, in Wisconsin, a state senator compared an ultrasound provision to the Taliban\u2019s treatment of women. Later in the summer, abortion advocates championed Texas state senator Wendy Davis as a feminist George A. Custer in a futile battle against the state\u2019s legislation banning abortions after 20 weeks\u2019 gestation and against increased standards at clinics; Time asked if she was \u201cCinderella\u201d for state Democrats. Nonetheless, the tactic has had some success: Democrat Terry McAuliffe won the Virginia governorship by almost solely using the \u201cwar on women\u201d playbook against Republican Ken Cuccinelli.\n\n2. Obamacare\n\nThe Affordable Care Act has served as the main catalyst for the \u201cwar on women.\u201d From conservatives\u2019 efforts to protect religious liberty over the contraception mandate (\u201cThe GOP\u2019s Women-Hating Obamacare Conscience Clause\u201d) to their reservations over required maternity care in new policies, Democrats such as Nancy Pelosi have framed resistance to the law\u2019s implementation as an \u201cunprecedented assault on women\u2019s rights.\u201d Democratic National Committee chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz has also led the charge, going so far as to say Republicans are \u201ccallous and insensitive\u201d toward women and \u201cturning back the clock.\u201d Democrats drummed up the chant heavily during the 2012 presidential campaign and, during the recent government shutdown, briefly revived it as it pertains to Obamacare.\n\n3. Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act\n\nCongressional Democrats used the equal-pay bill to bludgeon Republicans for their lack of compassion toward women, despite the Washington Free Beacon\u2019s findings that at least 37 Senate Democrats pay female staffers less than they pay their male coworkers. Representative Jackie Speier (D., Calif.) interpreted Republicans\u2019 opposition to the bill as advocating that \u201cwomen should be barefoot and pregnant.\u201d Even Republican women aren\u2019t free from the attacks of the Left: Salon\u2019s Joan Walsh condescendingly referred to Representative Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee as \u201cspecial\u201d for her comments in opposition to the law.\n\n4. Sequester\n\nWith the sequester underway earlier this year, Women\u2019s eNews contributor Sharon Johnson provided a list on the Huffington Post of how the automatic budget cuts were waging war on women across a wide range of programs, including transportation services and nutrition centers. Johnson heralded both President Obama\u2019s and Senate Democrats\u2019 efforts while House Republicans sat idly, allowing the sequester to continue to next year, with further cuts to hurt women. Members of the Congressional Black Caucus also claimed that women, along with minorities, would be disproportionately hurt by the sequester.\n\n5. Immigration Reform\n\nFailing to pass immigration reform is further perpetuating the war on women, according to White House adviser Lynn Rosenthal. In a blog post, she said it was \u201cup to Republicans in the House\u201d to pass the Senate\u2019s immigration bill; otherwise, immigrant women without legal status would continue to be at risk of domestic abuse because of their fear of contacting authorities. \u201cI want to make sure immigrant survivors [of domestic abuse] are not forgotten by shedding light on the important ways in which sensible immigration reform that has already passed the Senate will protect victims and hold abusers accountable,\u201d she wrote.\n\n6. Government Shutdown\n\n\u201cTea Party Republicans hit women with low blows,\u201d Representative Susan Davis (D., Calif.) declared during last month\u2019s government shutdown. Coupling her comments with the usual Obamacare scares, Davis claimed that \u201ctaking away women\u2019s access to care was so important to these Republicans\u201d that they were also willing to allow cutbacks to funding for Head Start and the Violence Against Women Act; fellow Californian Barbara Boxer echoed Davis\u2019s comments. For Democrats\u2019 reference, ThinkProgress even came up with a handy listing of \u201cHow the GOP shutdown is hurting women.\u201d\n\n7. Voter ID\n\nRecent voter-ID initiatives launched in states such as North Carolina and Texas have riled up commentators and lawmakers on the left, who claim the measures are efforts to disenfranchise women. MSNBC stalwarts Thomas Roberts and Michael Eric Dyson accused Texas Republicans of enacting such laws to restrict women\u2019s access to the ballot; Dyson went so far as to say the state GOP wants only \u201cwhite men of means\u201d to vote.\n\n8. Gerrymandering\n\nWriting at RH Reality Check, Adele M. Stan, an editor at AlterNet, chronicled how the Koch brothers have used gerrymandering to spread the \u201cwar on women.\u201d One Ohio state senator accused the philanthropists of having \u201crigged\u201d the system against women\u2019s interests and acting as \u201cthieves in the night\u201d to promote harmful legislation on both a national and a state level.\n\n9. Government-Job Layoffs\n\nAny threats of cuts to government jobs or pay can somehow be posed as an attack on women, including during the government shutdown, even though more than half of the federal workforce is male. When confronted with these charges, Democrats reveal their hypocrisy. For example, unions, lashing out at Democratic Los Angeles mayor Antonio Villaraigosa last year for waging a \u201cwar on women,\u201d said that city layoffs would result in more women losing jobs than men, Villaraigosa brushed the charge aside, calling the claim \u201cso outrageous it doesn\u2019t deserve an answer.\u201d\n\n10. Climate Change\n\nMore than a dozen Democrats earlier this year pushed a resolution that called on Congress to recognize that climate change negatively affects women more than it does men. For example, supporters warned that climate change could push women into prostitution if a natural disaster affected food supply: The resolution read that \u201cfood insecure women\u201d could find themselves in \u201csituations such as sex work, transactional sex, and early marriage.\u201d In a statement, Representative Barbara Lee (D., Calif.) told The Hill that her resolution called on Congress and the president to use \u201cgender-specific frameworks\u201d and \u201cintegrate a gender approach\u201d to address the issue of climate change.\n\n\u2014 Andrew Johnson is an editorial associate at National Review Online.", "article_metadata": {"tweettext": "The Left and the \u2018War on Women\u2019", "sailthru.author": "Andrew Johnson", "description": "The \u201cwar on women\u201d is a widespread campaign that spans nearly every policy, according to Democratic lawmakers and their devotees.\n\nOver the past few years, the \u201cwar on women\u201d trope has been a go-to tactic against the GOP on nearly any piece of legislation, leaving no issue free from the clutches of Republicans\u2019 supposed animosity for women.
