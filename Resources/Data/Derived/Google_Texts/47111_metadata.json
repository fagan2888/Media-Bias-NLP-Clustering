The suit takes on the city for destroying the owners\u2019 property \u2014 by forcing closure of their store \u2014 without a penny in the \u201cjust compensation\u201d required by the Fifth Amendment. PLF\u2019s representation will begin with an appeal of the city\u2019s shell-game ploy that got Perfect Puppy\u2019s case arbitrarily dismissed \u2014 a bizarre procedural maneuver in which the city transferred Perfect Puppy\u2019s state-court lawsuit to federal court, and then successfully argued to the federal judge that it should not be heard because it needed to be litigated in state court!\n\n\n\nHeadquartered in Sacramento and with regional offices on both coasts, donor-supported PLF is the nation\u2019s leading watchdog organization that litigates for limited government, property rights, and free enterprise, in courts across the country. PLF represents Perfect Puppy free of charge, as with all the foundation\u2019s clients.\n\nA conscientious small business is\n\nsideswiped by politicians who ignore the Constitution\n\nThe story began last year, when East Providence officials apparently decided they needed to be on the progressive \u201ccutting edge\u201d by banning stores that sell pets. This was devastating for Perfect Puppy, which had just opened a store in the city after securing all necessary licenses and passing all inspections.\n\n\n\nAs the store\u2019s owner and manager, Scott Bergantino, explained in urging the City Council not to impose the ban, Perfect Puppy is a well-run, conscientious business that stresses concern and care for its animals. It hand-selects all its dogs; does not patronize puppy mills; certifies the puppies\u2019 health; has never been cited for any health violation; and does such a brisk business that no dog stays in the store long.\n\n\n\nNone of this mattered to the council. Siding with activist groups that are concerned about the entirely distinct and different issue of \u201cpuppy mills\u201d \u2014 a concern, ironically, that Perfect Puppy\u2019s owners share \u2014 the council imposed the ban.\n\n\n\nThe city\u2019s arbitrary action destroyed the owners\u2019 financial investment. With their store shut down, their lease and license in East Providence were now worthless.\n\n\n\nThe city offered no reimbursement, so the owners filed suit in Rhode Island state court under both the state and federal constitutions.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe underlying issues aren\u2019t complicated, they\u2019re as basic as the difference between right and wrong,\u201d said PLF Principal Attorney J. David Breemer. \u201cIf government takes your property, government has to pay you for it. And that goes for government action that destroys the use or value of your property. Citizens are entitled to access to the courts to protect this right. This isn\u2019t just a matter of fairness, it\u2019s a constitutional rule that every American knows or should know. In fact, this case amounts to Constitutional Property Rights 101.\u201d\n\nThe city\u2019s procedural gimmick to deny Perfect Puppy access to justice\n\nInstead of owning up to its constitutional violation and doing the fair thing by offering compensation for its taking, the city responded to Perfect Puppy\u2019s litigation with a procedural gimmick.\n\n\n\nThe city\u2019s lawyers removed (transferred) the case to a federal court on the basis that it raised federal constitutional questions. Then, they argued that the takings claim was unripe (or procedurally premature) in federal court \u2014 and couldn\u2019t be heard there \u2014 because it had to be first fully litigated in state court under a doctrine known as the Williamson County ripeness doctrine. This doctrine generally says that takings plaintiffs must sue and lose in state court before they can have their federal takings claims heard by a federal court.\n\n\n\nThe federal court judge accepted this bizarre argument and declined to hear Perfect Puppy\u2019s case. Instead, the case was sent back to state court \u2014 where Perfect Puppy originally started but couldn\u2019t get a hearing because the city moved the case to federal court.\n\n\n\nThis left the business owners in legal limbo. They were denied a hearing in state court and now have been denied a hearing in the federal court. But PLF is now challenging this merry-go-round process, to get the store back on the road to justice. On appeal to the Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, PLF attorneys are determined to get Perfect Puppy\u2019s case reinstated in federal court.\n\n\n\nIndeed, two years ago, PLF won a landmark ruling at the Fourth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals against a similar procedural ploy by a North Carolina town that sought to escape takings liability by jerking a property owner\u2019s case from state to federal court, and then seeking dismissal.\n\n\n\n\u201cGovernment can\u2019t deny citizens their day in court by procedural gamesmanship,\u201d said Breemer. \u201cWe\u2019re in America, not a Kafka novel. Government lawyers can\u2019t perform absurd procedural contortions to leave property owners dizzied, financially exhausted and without their day in court. Government can\u2019t whipsaw property owners between state and federal courts in order to rob them of any judicial hearing on their constitutional claims.\n\n\n\n\u201cPLF secured a first-of-its-kind decision holding exactly this in the 2013 case of Sansotta v. Town of Nags Head, at the Fourth Circuit,\u201d Breemer continued. \u201cHopefully, the appeals court in Perfect Puppy\u2019s case will adopt the same reasoning, and give the business a chance to make the city pay just compensation for destroying its store and its owners\u2019 dreams.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re grateful that Pacific Legal Foundation is stepping up to defend our constitutional rights,\u201d said Scott Bergantino. \u201cThis is a case about basic fairness, and my family and I believe we\u2019re fighting for everyone\u2019s constitutional right not to be deprived of their property without just compensation.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe case is Perfect Puppy, Inc. v. City of East Providence. PLF\u2019s opening appeal brief will be filed sometime in mid-Summer, 2015.\n\n\n\nAbout Pacific Legal Foundation\n\nDonor-supported Pacific Legal Foundation is the leading legal watchdog organization that litigates for limited government, property rights and free enterprise, in courts across the country.
