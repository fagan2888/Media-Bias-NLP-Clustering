But Playboy seemed to know exactly what it had on its hands when Gary Oldman unleashed a sweeping, unguarded commentary on everything from marriage and sobriety to Mel Gibson and, er, the Jews.\n\nIt takes a special kind of skill at interviewing to guide a celebrity on a publicity tour toward statements like \u201cwe\u2019re up shit creek without a paddle or a compass\u201d\u2014and then to nudge him into detailing exactly why, and how, and who is to blame.\n\nIn the ensuing avalanche of disregard, Mr Oldman critiques helicopter parents, reality television and a high-school coach who talked two students into going undercover to bust a pot deal. He slams Hollywood and the media for manufacturing superficially uncontrollable \u201clittle monsters\u201d like Miley Cyrus.\n\nWoven in between thoughtful reflections on life, art and his work, Mr Oldman\u2019s pointed attacks leave few of America\u2019s sacred cows left standing. But, in a kind of poetic irony, it was his choice of whom to defend that made his interview go viral. Specifically, he weighed in on the way Mel Gibson has become a cultural villain in recent years, explaining, \u201che\u2019s actually bitten the hand that I guess has fed him,\u201d in \u201ca town that\u2019s run by Jews,\u201d no less.\n\nThe remarks promptly incurred the wrath not only of the internet\u2019s values police but the Anti-Defamation League, whose rejection of Oldman\u2019s subsequent apology letter touched off a bona fide PR problem. On Jimmy Kimmel\u2019s late night show, Oldman caved completely, visibly weary and defeated. \u201cI am profoundly, profoundly sorry and deeply apologetic,\u201d he sighed. \u201cI\u2019m a public figure. I should be an example and an inspiration, and I\u2019m an A-hole.\u201d\n\nFor many, that\u2019s poetic justice, and exactly the kind of public smackdown a successful white man deserves for giving aid and comfort to someone like Mr Gibson.\n\nWhat\u2019s being lost in the outrage, however, is perhaps more significant. It is plain from the very outset of his interview that Mr Oldman\u2019s ill-considered remarks are fuelled by a potent, all-encompassing frustration\u2014a near-despair over America\u2019s cultural and political institutions. He sees a world rotten with corruption, hypocrisy and vanity, one that celebrates its pathologies rather than face up to them. Political correctness, for Mr Oldman, is merely a symptom of the disease. So he drops an f-bomb on the Pope (\u201cOh, fuck the pope! [laughs and puts head in hands] So this interview has gone very badly\"), he doubts that stable love and lasting marriage can survive modern life, and he cries out for \u201creal leadership,\u201d though \u201cit\u2019s nowhere in sight.\u201d\n\nMost important of all, Mr Oldman puts no faith in either of America\u2019s prevailing ideological camps, whose comprehensive doctrines are the last refuge for many angry and fearful folk. \u201cI\u2019m probably a libertarian,\u201d he guesses, \u201cif I had to put myself in any category. But you don\u2019t come out and talk about these things, for obvious reasons.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s more to that caveat than a guilty conscience. What\u2019s truly scandalous about Mr Oldman\u2019s worldview is his unflinching claim that the American social order is built on an interconnected system of frauds. This idea is ultimately too big of a challenge for most people to process, much less accept. And Mr Oldman\u2019s diatribe did not exactly suggest a way forward. But his views reflect the gut instinct of a growing number of independent voters, as well as the Rand Paul and Elizabeth Warren wings of the Republican and Democratic parties. Rather than a fox in the cultural henhouse, perhaps Mr Oldman can be seen as a canary in the coal mine.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/50_by_50/images/2014/06/blogs/democracy-america/20140628_usp505.jpg", "sailthru.flytitle": "Celebrity and politics", "description": "An actor's candid comments earn the ire of the internet's values police", "pubdate": 20140629, "og": {"site_name": "The Economist", "description": "An actor's candid comments earn the ire of the internet's values police", "title": "What's the matter with Gary Oldman?", "url": "http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2014/06/celebrity-and-politics", "image": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2014/06/blogs/democracy-america/20140628_usp505.jpg", "type": "article"}, "sailthru.rubric": "An actor's candid comments earn the ire of the internet's values police", "sailthru.date": "2014-06-29 15:15:30", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2014/06/blogs/democracy-america/20140628_usp505.jpg", "revisit-after": "1 day", "sailthru.tags": "Celebrity and politics", "fb": {"pages": 6013004059, "app_id": 173277756049645}, "sailthru.imagepath": "images/2014/06/blogs/democracy-america/20140628_usp505.jpg", "articleid": 21606136, "sailthru.image.thumb_mfte": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/ec_related_article_image/images/2014/06/blogs/democracy-america/20140628_usp505.jpg", "sailthru.web_section": "Blogs", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theeconomist"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2014/06/blogs/democracy-america/20140628_usp505.jpg", "site": "@TheEconomist", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@EconUS"}, "news_keywords": "Celebrity and politics"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf8cf\"", "article_summary": "Rather than a fox in the cultural henhouse, perhaps Mr Oldman can be seen as a canary in the coal mine.\nWhat\u2019s truly scandalous about Mr Oldman\u2019s worldview is his unflinching claim that the American social order is built on an interconnected system of frauds.\nIn the ensuing avalanche of disregard, Mr Oldman critiques helicopter parents, reality television and a high-school coach who talked two students into going undercover to bust a pot deal.\nPolitical correctness, for Mr Oldman, is merely a symptom of the disease.\nWoven in between thoughtful reflections on life, art and his work, Mr Oldman\u2019s pointed attacks leave few of America\u2019s sacred cows left standing."}
