He was targeted only once and had zero receptions in the loss, while fellow tight end Owen Daniels caught six of nine targets for 102 yards and a game-tying, 1-yard touchdown in the fourth quarter.\n\nBut the loss, though hardly pleasant, had its value to Davis.\n\n\u201cI was just absorbing it all in, watching some of my teammates, Owen Daniels and Virgil (Green),\u201d Davis said afterward. \u201cWatching those guys and learning from them as I continue to move forward.\u201d\n\n\n\nDavis said he entered the game knowing \u201ca bulk\u201d of the Broncos\u2019 playbook after less than a week with the team.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s still more that I need to know, in order to get out there and be able play fast,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know how it is when you\u2019re thinking. You can\u2019t play fast. You\u2019re worried about this, you\u2019re worried about that, your mind\u2019s not free. So I just got to keep attacking it, keep getting better and better.\u201d\n\nAlthough Davis hopes to take what he observed and in apply it in future practices, future game days, he isn\u2019t one to dwell. Moving on from the first loss of the season, he said, requires letting go.\n\n\u201cIt happens,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t dwell on the. You just have to move forward and get ready for the next one.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Broncos,Colts,Owen Daniels", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "First-and-Orange", "description": "Vernon Davis said he knew \"a bulk\" of the Broncos' playbook going into Sunday's game, but needs to know more to be able to play at his usual speed.", "title": "Vernon Davis was \"watching and learning\" in Broncos' first loss of season", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2015/11/08/vernon-davis-watching-and-learning-in-broncos-first-loss-of-season/36398/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2015/11/496334730-495x329.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Vernon Davis said he knew \"a bulk\" of the Broncos' playbook going into Sunday's game, but needs to know more to be able to play at his usual speed.", "title": "Vernon Davis \u201cwatching and learning\u201d in Broncos\u2019 first loss of season", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2015/11/08/vernon-davis-watching-and-learning-in-broncos-first-loss-of-season/36398/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2015/11/496334730-495x329.jpg", "creator": "@nickijhabvala", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Vernon Davis said he knew \"a bulk\" of the Broncos' playbook going into Sunday's game, but needs to know more to be able to play at his usual speed."}, "article_summary": "You\u2019re worried about this, you\u2019re worried about that, your mind\u2019s not free.\n\u201cI was just absorbing it all in, watching some of my teammates, Owen Daniels and Virgil (Green),\u201d Davis said afterward.\nDavis\u2019 snaps were limited, as expected, after only three full days of practice with the Broncos.\nThe excitement was tempered after his debut with his team, a 27-24 loss to the Colts.\nBut the loss, though hardly pleasant, had its value to Davis."}
