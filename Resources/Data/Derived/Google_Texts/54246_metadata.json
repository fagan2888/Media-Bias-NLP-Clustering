Considering the fact that, as of late 2012, somewhere around 40 percent of Americans still think Obamacare has \u201cdeath panels,\u201d this is no small feat. (I can almost picture Jean-Jacques Rousseau, that great believer in the basic wisdom and virtue of The People, watching us in horror while rocking back and forth and quietly repeating to himself, \u201cI\u2019ve made a huge mistake.\u201d)\n\nYet despite the initial burst of misinformation that followed the release of the report, and despite the inevitable tornado of negative advertising that\u2019ll erroneously cite the CBO when claiming Obamacare \u201ckills\u201d millions of jobs, I think the CBO\u2019s latest will ultimately be worth it. Not for what it revealed about Obamacare, but for what it showed us about the ideological divide that defines American politics.\n\nHere\u2019s what I mean: Once the media acknowledged that the report said Obamacare would reduce labor\u2019s supply, and not its demand \u2014 by providing workers with healthcare coverage whether or not they hold a full-time job \u2014 the debate shifted onto terrain more resembling objective reality, and we got a better sense of where the right and the left really stood. Specifically, we were able to see what the right really means when it talks about \u201cfreedom\u201d and \u201cliberty,\u201d phrases that, as conservatives use them, mean less than meets the eye.\n\nBut first, to clarify, this is what the CBO\u2019s report actually said:\n\nThe estimated reduction stems almost entirely from a net decline in the amount of labor that workers choose to supply, rather than from a net drop in businesses\u2019 demand for labor, so it will appear almost entirely as a reduction in labor force participation and in hours worked relative to what would have occurred otherwise rather than as an increase in unemployment (that is, more workers seeking but not finding jobs) or underemployment (such as part-time workers who would prefer to work more hours per week).\n\nAnd this is what that actually means: People who would like to retire but aren\u2019t old enough to qualify for Medicare, or people who would like to work part-time but can\u2019t afford to lose their employer-provided health insurance, will now be able to quit or cut back on their jobs without having to live with prohibitively expensive, or simply nonexistent, health insurance. And at least to this leftie\u2019s ears, that sounds like a good thing.\n\nMany people on the right, however, had a very different response.\n\nFirst there were those who still clung bitterly to the early misrepresentation that Obamacare destroys jobs. These are the most rigid partisans, people who live in their own carefully curated epistemic world, and there\u2019s no getting through to them, no matter how many fact-checks you link to or email their way. Besides, they\u2019re more focused on the big fish, like Benghazi, the greatest cover-up in history, to spend too much time talking health policy.\n\nThen there were those on the right who acknowledged the CBO\u2019s actual findings, but found them troubling all the same. These folks argued that the CBO had shown Obamacare created perverse incentives, allowing people to spend less of their time engaged in wage labor, and that the government should be pushing people to work a paying job instead. This is a much more philosophical position, rather than an empirical claim about how the law might affect the economy, and it\u2019s deeply revealing of the right\u2019s fundamental ideological beliefs.\n\nThere were many examples of this (my colleague Brian Beutler has cataloged a few), but none were as clearly and stridently put as Charles C.W. Cooke\u2019s in the National Review. Cooke\u2019s jeremiad against \u201cObamacare\u2019s attack on the work ethic\u201d is pretty straightforward: Anything that the government does to make it easier for people to separate themselves from wage labor is bad, because work is, quite simply, an absolute good.
