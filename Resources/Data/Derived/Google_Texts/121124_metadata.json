Like Townsend, Addo was born in Middletown.\n\nA University of Connecticut graduate, Townsend is cofounder and COO of HomeHero, a marketplace and technology platform that connects families with in-home care for seniors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHealthcare is in a really interesting time period,\u201d said Townsend. \u201cThe Affordable Care Act has changed the environment between agencies, care centers, hospitals, payers. When you change incentives, everything drastically changes.\u201d\n\nThe tech idea was inspired by the challenges of managing home care for partner Kyle Hill\u2019s grandmother.\n\n\u201cKyle\u2019s grandma is our longest-standing client,\u201d said Townsend. \u201cIt was a real struggle to manage care long distance.\u201d\n\nFamilies who care for aging parents quickly learn that finding and managing in-home care is a stressful and time-consuming process. So Townsend and his partners sought a way to locate the best caregivers and to securely track and organize appointments, contacts and medications.\n\nCaregivers outline their care needs, and can view videos of local healthcare professionals. Once they contact the \u201cHero\u201d directly, staff will organize appointments, medications and even manage payments.\n\n\u201cWe helped and became inspired by using technology to make the process easier,\u201d said Townsend, now a resident of Santa Monica, California.\n\nTownsend visits his family in Connecticut regularly, and also enjoys time at their Block Island house, he said. Parents Lisa and Tom Townsend remain in their Middletown home where Mike Townsend grew up with brother Devon Townsend, 26, now a resident of Venice, California.\n\nTownsend\u2019s brother also develops apps, like one called \u201cI\u2019d Cap That,\u201d which adds captions to user photos.\n\n\u201cWe hang out and brainstorm all the time,\u201d said Mike Townsend, who studied engineering at UConn.\n\nAfter graduation in 2010, Mike Townsend took a job as a design engineer at Brookstone Inc., moving to Singapore. Later, he moved to Los Angeles to help design radar systems for military-grade unmanned aerial vehicles as a mechanical engineer at ITT Corp. in Los Angeles.\n\nAs his career evolved, he became active in the payment industry, founding ZingCheckout, one of the first web-based point-of-sale systems in 2010, and Flowtab, a mobile payment app for the nightlife industry in 2011, he explained.\n\nLaunched in January 2014, HomeHero is a marketplace and technology platform created with the aim of helping families manage senior care and distribute personalized healthcare technology in the home.\n\nWith a current staff of 28, HomeHero is operating from Santa Monica, a city with the second-highest senior population in the country, Mike Townsend said.\n\nThe platform is now available in four California cities, and has provided \u201ca million hours of care so far, and improved the lives of thousands,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAs much as I\u2019d like to roll it out in Connecticut tomorrow, a lot is determined by city climate for seniors, the regulatory environment,\u201d said Mike Townsend, pointing to the natural inefficiency of changing large systems. \u201cWe are riding the efficiency wave.\u201d\n\nFor information, visit homehero.org.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Business, Business news, Middletown Business news, CT Business news, US Business news, world Business news.", "title": "Middletown native\u2019s tech biz connects caregivers, healthcare pros", "og": {"url": "http://www.middletownpress.com/article/MI/20160118/NEWS/160119650", "image": {"width": "1074px", "identifier": "http://www.middletownpress.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/MI/20160118/NEWS/160119650/AR/0/AR-160119650.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "692px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Middletown native\u2019s tech biz connects caregivers, healthcare pros"}, "twitter": {"domain": "middletownpress.com", "description": "MIDDLETOWN >>  City native Mike Townsend, 28, made the Forbes 30 Under 30 list for 2015 with other young game-chan", "title": "Middletown native\u2019s tech biz connects caregivers, healthcare pros", "url": "http://www.middletownpress.com/article/MI/20160118/NEWS/160119650", "image": {"src": "http://www.middletownpress.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/MI/20160118/NEWS/160119650/AR/0/AR-160119650.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@Middletownpress", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id569948531", "iphone": "id520204340", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.middletownpress"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Business, Business news, Middletown Business news, CT Business news, US Business news, world Business news.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "MIDDLETOWN >>  City native Mike Townsend, 28, made the Forbes 30 Under 30 list for 2015 with other young game-chan"}, "article_summary": "MIDDLETOWN >> City native Mike Townsend, 28, made the Forbes 30 Under 30 list for 2015 with other young game-changers who are transforming the world.\nParents Lisa and Tom Townsend remain in their Middletown home where Mike Townsend grew up with brother Devon Townsend, 26, now a resident of Venice, California.\nAfter graduation in 2010, Mike Townsend took a job as a design engineer at Brookstone Inc., moving to Singapore.\n\u201cWe hang out and brainstorm all the time,\u201d said Mike Townsend, who studied engineering at UConn.\n\u201cIt was a real struggle to manage care long distance.\u201dFamilies who care for aging parents quickly learn that finding and managing in-home care is a stressful and time-consuming process."}
