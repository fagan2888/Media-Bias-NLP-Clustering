The little scrutiny she has received to date focuses on her record as the CEO of Hewlett-Packard.\n\nThat record is relevant to her candidacy. For me, however, her past positions on the major issues are more important. Has she been a consistent, hard-line conservative?\n\nThe early returns aren\u2019t good for Fiornia. In a 2013 interview, she expressed support for an individual mandate which would require folks to purchase high-deductible \u201ccatastrophic care\u201d insurance plans and use federal dollars to subsidize state-based high-risk pools to provide care for those who otherwise cannot afford it.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that such a requirement is very different from Obamacare\u2019s individual mandate, which requires folks the purchase of plans that cover just about everything. Healthy young people, who only really need insurance against major unexpected health events, must pay high premiums for broad coverage. People who can\u2019t have children must purchase plans that cover child birth.\n\nObamacare actually undermines the purchase of the kind of plan to which, I think, Fiorina wanted the mandate to apply. Such plans aren\u2019t Obamacare compliant and have become very difficult to find.\n\nIt is also true that Fiorina\u2019s position is similar to that advanced some years back by the Heritage Foundation. I believe, however, that Heritage had moved away from that position by 2013.\n\nIn any event, the individual mandate is widely despised by conservatives. So is this the beginning of the end for Fiorina?\n\nI don\u2019t assume so. Mitt Romney supported Heritage\u2019s individual mandate and received the 2012 nomination. This isn\u2019t 2012, to be sure. Anti-establishment sentiment seems considerably stronger this time around. On the other hand, the individual mandate may not be the front-burner issue it was back then, when the Supreme Court narrowly upheld it.\n\nThere are more choices for conservatives in this cycle than in the last, but purity remains elusive. Trump is very far from ideologically pure. Bush deviates on immigration and common core. Rubio seems to deviate only on immigration, but to a huge extent on that vital issue. Carson opposed military intervention in Afghanistan. Among the top contenders, only Cruz appears never to have left his right flank unattended.\n\nMy sense is that Fiorina\u2019s support of an individual mandate is strike one. Her record at Hewlett-Packard might or might not turn into strike two; it depends on how that argument goes.\n\nWill there be more ideological strikes? I don\u2019t know, but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Power Line", "description": "Now that Carly Fiorina has emerged as a top-six candidate (at worst) for the GOP nomination, she will receive serious scrutiny.
