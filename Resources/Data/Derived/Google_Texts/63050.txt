Corner of Irving and Meridian

A Wichita police canine mistakenly bites another law enforcement officer in the middle of a traffic stop.

It happened around 11 p.m. last night on Irving street, near Meridian and McCormick.

Lieutenant Jason Gill reported that a deputy noticed a driver slumped over and went to investigate. When the deputy made contact with the driver there was no response. Noticing there was a knife next to him, the officer called for backup.

The driver ran as the officers were trying to get him out of the vehicle and officers gave chase. They caught him a couple of houses away and during the struggle a Wichita police officer with a canine stopped to assist.

When the officer got out the K-9 self deployed, like they are supposed to do, and attacked the leg of a deputy by accident.

"The dog does not know the difference between a bad guy or a police officer. they don't see the things that we see, uniforms and things like that. we actually train deputies to be aware of that," says Gill.

The dog had bitten the leg of the deputy several times. Fortunately she was also a K-9 deputy and knew how to stop the dog from attacking, it could have been worse otherwise.

"It was not a mistake for the dog to do what it did," stated Gill.

The deputy suffered significant injuries to her leg and was in surgery overnight. She's expected to make a full recovery, though.

The driver, a 29-year-old known gang member, was taken into custody for several charges, including outstanding warrants and interfering with law enforcement.
