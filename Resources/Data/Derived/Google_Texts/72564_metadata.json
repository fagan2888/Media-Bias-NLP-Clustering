Last year, they said, their four children waited for hours to participate in some activities and then were rained out in the afternoon.\n\nThe family did not wait more than 10 minutes for any activity Saturday, Kea Toothaker said.\n\nThe family's four children, Cole, 12; Carly, 10; Kye, 7; and Kendall, 5, were also impressed with the festival this year.\n\n\"I liked the gyroscope,\" Cole said. \"It's this big sphere that spins you around and around and around.\"\n\nCarly said rock climbing was her favorite activity. Kendall and Kye said they liked the bike track and paddleboarding.\n\nThe activities were broken into younger and older age groups, Brady Toothaker said, making it easier to allow all of the kids to participate.\n\nThe Toothakers said they were also pleased with the cooler-than-normal temperatures Saturday.\n\nMusic kicked off at 9 a.m. with the Bakersfield Band and was expected to continue through 8 p.m.\n\nThe nearby St. Vrain River remained closed due to damage from the September flood.\n\nContact Times-Call community reporter Whitney Bryen at 303-684-5274 or wbryen@times-call.com.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_26138881/longmont-families-impressed-rhythm-river", "sailthru.section": "Local News", "sailthru.author": "By Whitney Bryen \n \n  Times-Call community reporter", "description": "It was all about kids early Saturday at Longmont's 19th annual Rhythm on the River festival at Roger's Grove Park.", "ag": {"canon": "LongmontTimes-Call:article:26138881:view"}, "startDate": "2014-07-12T18:42:25-0600", "og": {"url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_26138881/longmont-families-impressed-rhythm-river", "image": "http://local.timescall.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/timescall.png", "type": "article", "description": "It was all about kids early Saturday at Longmont's 19th annual Rhythm on the River festival at Roger's Grove Park.", "title": "Longmont families impressed with Rhythm on the River"}, "twitter": {"domain": "timescall.com", "description": "It was all about kids early Saturday at Longmont's 19th annual Rhythm on the River festival at Roger's Grove Park.", "title": "Longmont families impressed with Rhythm on the River", "url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_26138881/longmont-families-impressed-rhythm-river", "image": "http://local.timescall.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/timescall.png", "site": "@TimesCall", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-07-12T18:42:25-0600", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "sailthru.title": "Longmont families impressed with Rhythm on the River", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "byline": "By Whitney BryenTimes-Call", "google-site-verification": "lLtD9ZooxmJUEEdRSCVzkO06t_hYKtyDqZF7EA3N2U0", "modificationDate": "2014-07-13T11:02:33-0600", "endDate": "2024-07-12T18:35:49-0600", "sailthru.site": "timescall.com", "pubDate": "2014-07-12T18:45:40-0600", "news_keywords": "Longmont Colorado TimesCall local news"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddc56\"", "article_summary": "Longmont residents Brady and Kea Toothaker said they were impressed with the short wait times this year after.\nGyroscope, rock climbing, among the popular attractionsIt was all about kids early Saturday at Longmont's 19th annual Rhythm on the River festival at Roger's Grove Park.\nThe family did not wait more than 10 minutes for any activity Saturday, Kea Toothaker said.\nThe family's four children, Cole, 12; Carly, 10; Kye, 7; and Kendall, 5, were also impressed with the festival this year.\nThe nearby St. Vrain River remained closed due to damage from the September flood."}
