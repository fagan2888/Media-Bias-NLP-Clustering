The spokesman said the new sanctions would not weaken the country's 1.2-million-strong military.\n\nRead more Activists Say North Koreans Want to Watch 'The Interview'\n\nThe spokesman told the North's official media mouthpiece, the Korean Central News Agency, that the sanctions show America's \"inveterate repugnancy and hostility toward the DPRK,\" referring to the North's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.\n\n\"The policy persistently pursued by the U.S. to stifle the DPRK, groundlessly stirring up bad blood toward it, would only harden its will and resolution to defend the sovereignty of the country,\" the spokesman said.\n\nThe United States on Friday sanctioned 10 North Korean government officials and three organizations, including Pyongyang's primary intelligence agency and state-run arms dealer, in what the White House described as an opening move in the response toward the Sony cyberattack.\n\nThe sanctions might have only a limited effect, as North Korea already is under tough U.S. and international sanctions over its nuclear and missile programs. President Barack Obama also warned Pyongyang that the United States was considering whether to put North Korea back on its list of state sponsors of terrorism, which could jeopardize aid to the country on a global scale.\n\nRead more Poll: Cast the Inevitable Sony Hack Movie\n\nAmerican officials portrayed the sanctions as a swift, decisive response to North Korean behavior that they said had gone far over the line. Never before has the U.S. imposed sanctions on another nation in direct retaliation for a cyberattack on an American company.\n\nThere have been doubts in the cyber community, however, about the extent of North Korea's involvement. Many experts have said it's possible that hackers or even Sony insiders could be the culprits, and questioned how the FBI can point the finger so conclusively.\n\nThe 10 North Koreans singled out for sanctions didn't necessarily have anything to do with the attack on Sony, senior U.S. officials said. Anyone who works for or helps North Korea's government is now fair game, especially North Korea's defense sector and spying operations, they said.\n\nRead more 'The Interview' Is Google Play, YouTube's Best-Selling Title of 2014\n\nNorth Korea has expressed fury over The Interview, an anti-Pyongyang Sony comedy. It has denied hacking Sony, but called the act a \"righteous deed.\"\n\nSony initially decided to call off the film's release after movie theaters decided not to show the film. After Obama criticized that decision, Sony released the movie in limited theaters and online.\n\nQuestions remain about who was behind a nearly 10-hour recent shutdown of North Korean websites. The United States never said whether it was responsible, but North Korea's powerful National Defense Commission blamed the U.S. and hurled racial slurs at Obama, calling him a reckless \"monkey in a tropical forest.\"\n\nSuch hateful comments are not new: Pyongyang has similarly attacked other U.S. officials and called South Korea's female president a prostitute.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "The Associated Press", "description": "The sanctions show America's \"inveterate repugnancy and hostility,\" according to a spokesperson", "og": {"site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "description": "The sanctions show America's \"inveterate repugnancy and hostility,\" according to a spokesperson", "title": "North Korea Blasts U.S. for Sanctions Over Sony Hack", "url": "http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/north-korea-blasts-us-sanctions-761045", "image": {"width": 1296, "identifier": "//cdn4.thr.com/sites/default/files/2014/12/the_interview_still_4.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 730}, "type": "website"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-01-04 09:14:02", "sailthru.title": "North Korea Blasts U.S. for Sanctions Over Sony Hack", "fb": {"admins": 3111204}, "sailthru.vertical": "The Business", "sailthru.tags": "Movies,Business,The Interview,Sony Hack", "sailthru.description": "The sanctions show America's \"inveterate repugnancy and hostility,\" according to a spokesperson", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Anyone who works for or helps North Korea's government is now fair game, especially North Korea's defense sector and spying operations, they said.\nQuestions remain about who was behind a nearly 10-hour recent shutdown of North Korean websites.\nThere have been doubts in the cyber community, however, about the extent of North Korea's involvement.\nThe sanctions might have only a limited effect, as North Korea already is under tough U.S. and international sanctions over its nuclear and missile programs.\nRead more Poll: Cast the Inevitable Sony Hack MovieAmerican officials portrayed the sanctions as a swift, decisive response to North Korean behavior that they said had gone far over the line."}
