Like that attack 47 years ago, the recent terrorist attacks refute an administration\u2019s claims and widen America\u2019s doubts about President Obama\u2019s strategy to counter them. Unlike that earlier episode however, the person who would pay the political price for it would not be this president, but his party\u2019s 2016 nominee.\n\nEntering 1968, Lyndon Johnson was both seeking reelection and to assure America that the war in Vietnam was being won. Because of his enlargement of America\u2019s role there, \u201chis\u201d war and his reelection were inextricably intertwined. Yet, both also seemed his to lose \u2014 the first, arising from his administration\u2019s own assessment of the military situation, and the second, due to his previous landslide victory.\n\nThe unexpected explosion of a full blown communist offensive shattered the administration\u2019s war narrative, and with it, Johnson\u2019s reelection aspirations.\n\nWhile obviously very different in their particulars, the recent terrorist attacks \u2014 especially ISIS\u2019 Paris attack last month \u2014 have remarkable political similarities to its Vietnam predecessor.\n\nMr. Obama has made it a foundation of his administration that he is successfully winding down America\u2019s Middle East involvement and that terrorism\u2019s threat is being reduced.\n\nIn January 2014, Mr. Obama had dismissed ISIS by saying in an interview: \u201cThe analogy that we use around here sometimes is if a jayvee team puts on Lakers uniforms that doesn\u2019t make them Kobe Bryant.\u201d This September, despite evidence of spreading terrorist attacks \u2014 including an ISIS-affiliate\u2019s downing of a Russian passenger jet \u2014 and just days before the Paris attack, Mr. Obama stated in another interview: \u201cFrom the start, our goal has been first to contain them, and we have contained them \u201c\n\nThe Paris terrorist attack was a profound shock to America \u2014 even beyond its horrific nature but also because it had heard from Mr. Obama himself that his administration was successfully containing a JV terrorist team. Then came the San Bernardino attack.\n\nIn a recent CBS/New York Times poll, respondents disapproved of Obama\u2019s handling of terrorism 34 percent to 57 percent \u2014 his lowest in this poll\u2019s history \u2014 with seven of 10 seeing ISIS as a major threat to America. Terrorism had also leaped to the top problem facing the country, replacing the economy.\n\nOf course, terrorism\u2019s rise as a public concern is not Mr. Obama\u2019s worry the way it was for Johnson because Mr. Obama is not running for reelection. However, it is likely to be very much one to his party\u2019s likely 2016 presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton.\n\nHaving served in it prominently, Mrs. Clinton is particularly exposed to this administration in general and, because she was secretary of State, in particular to its foreign policy. Mrs./ Clinton is this administration\u2019s legacy \u2014 a role she needs to have to hold Mr. Obama\u2019s base next year. She was also the administrator of its foreign policy \u2014 a role she cannot escape, as the continuing questions over Benghazi and her State emails show.\n\nOf course, the administration\u2019s problems with the public do not stop at foreign policy. The economy and Obamacare \u2014 as well as other deeply divisive issues \u2014 are prominent ones, and therefore also ones the Democratic nominee will have to shoulder too.\n\nMrs. Clinton\u2019s weaknesses do not end with the administration. Politically, Democrats are generally seen as weaker on defense issues than Republicans. Personally, Hillary also has her own political baggage accumulated over the longest turn in the public spotlight of any top American politician. For this reason, her standing in the polls is relatively tenuous, frequently failing to gain majority support the general election \u2014 despite facing far less well-known opponents.\n\nWhile less politically exposed to the recent terrorist attacks, than was Johnson to the Tet Offensive, Mrs. Clinton is also politically weaker. Johnson had not only won a presidential election, he had won in 1964 in one of America\u2019s largest landslides. In his first term, he had accumulated a long list of items he could claim as accomplishments. And Johnson had little pre-presidency baggage to speak of.\n\nMrs. Clinton has none of these assets. In sum, Mrs. Clinton shares much of Johnson\u2019s exposure to a shocking foreign policy failure, but little of his political strength.\n\nWhile there may be a great chronological separation between the two episodes, they are more politically connected than they first appear. This connection could affect Hillary far more than anyone else who could be nominated next year. To fully appreciate how much it could, simply remember the extent the Tet Offensive, its fallout, and the Vietnam War affected Johnson, and then Hubert Humphrey, who sought to succeed him.\n\n\u2022 J.T.
