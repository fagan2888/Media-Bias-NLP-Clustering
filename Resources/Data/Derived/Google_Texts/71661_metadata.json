Lush green turf thrives on rolling courses in Calabasas, Agoura Hills, and Westlake Village, and well-watered ivy hugs Ventura Freeway medians -- all sustained by unique water supplies.\n\nAnd this while California bakes in a fourth year of drought.\n\nHow are these fairways and freeways so well irrigated? From flushing the toilet, that\u0092s how.\n\nModern technology cannot make new water from nothing any more than medieval alchemists could turn lead into gold. Nothing comes from nothing -- but something can come from wastewater.\n\nThe State Water Resources Control Board reports nearly 670,000 acre-feet of municipal wastewater is is now being recycled (annually) and reused for beneficial use. An acre-foot of water, 326,000 gallons, can supply a typical suburban household for a year.\n\nBeneficial uses include irrigating landscapes, golf courses, street medians, recreation areas, serving commercial and industrial needs, and restoring natural systems.\n\nProposition 1, passed by voters last November, allocates $725 million for recycled water and desalinization projects. Municipal agencies can apply for funds to upgrade wastewater treatment processes and distribute reclaimed wastewater for beneficial use. California\u0092s 38 million residents seemingly provide a ubiquitous wastewater supply.\n\nEveryone produces wastewater. However, among the obstacles to recycling and distributing it are costs, the level of treatment, and regulatory oversight.\n\nThe world\u0092s first public health regulation possibly originated over 3,400 years ago during Moses\u0092 forty year roam through the Sinai Desert. Upon nature\u0092s call, Moses directed the Israelites to \u0093take a shovel and cover it up.\u0094 In modern times, the first U.S. law that addressed water pollution was the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1948. The law was amended in 1972 with passage of the Clean Water Act.\n\nMunicipal wastewater treatment plants are man-made mechanical digestive systems. Like our bodies where organs process, digest and eliminate waste, wastewater treatment plants use physical, chemical and biological processes to remove contaminants.\n\nWhat flows into wastewater treatment plants ultimately leaves. Wastewater discharges are regulated by California\u0092s Regional Water Quality Control Boards. Regulations vary depending on the level of treatment. Primary treatment removes most solid matter, oils and greases. Secondary treatment uses bacteria to remove remaining solids and organic material. Tertiary treatment uses filtration to further remove remaining solids and disinfectants to destroy bacteria, viruses and pathogens. The product of tertiary treated wastewater is recycled water.\n\nBack on the western edge of Los Angeles County where it meets Ventura County, the Las Virgenes Municipal Water District (LVMWD) treats wastewater received from several incorporated and unincorporated areas. With the Triunfo Sanitation District, LVMWD operates the Tapia Water Reclamation Facility, a tertiary treatment plant located within the Malibu Creek watershed upstream of the Pacific Ocean. Tapia, about ten miles uphill from movie stars\u0092 homes, is also downstream of movie sets (M*A*S*H was filmed nearby). Tapia treats nine million gallons of sewage per day. LVMWD\u0092s distribution system consists of tanks, pumping stations, reservoirs, and miles of pipeline.\n\n\u0093We serve 650 recycled water accounts,\u0094 says Carlos Reyes, director of resource conservation and public outreach. \u0093Recycled water irrigates golf courses, homeowner association landscapes, sports fields, highway medians, and cemeteries.\u0094\n\nLVMWD annually produces about 10,000 acre-feet of recycled water. \u0093We sell about 6,000 acre-feet,\u0094 Mr. Reyes continues. \u0093Recycled water reduces our water imports from Northern California. We\u0092re allowed to discharge 4,000 acre-feet into Malibu Creek during the winter after demands taper off. Our capitalized costs for recycled water is about $740 an acre-foot, compared to over $1,000 an acre-foot for potable water.\n\nBut not everyone can tap into treated wastewater for a simple reason.\n\n\u0093We don\u0092t have dual plumbed residential accounts at this time,\u0094 Mr. Reyes says.\n\nIn Santa Clara County, 400 miles north of Malibu, recycled water comprises five percent of the county\u0092s water supply, which also relies on imported water from Northern California.\n\n\u0093We annually produce 22,000 acre-feet of recycled water,\u0094 says Hossein Ashktorab, water use efficiency manager for the Santa Clara Valley Water District. \u0093We serve 900 customers including the cities of Sunnyvale, Palo Alto and San Jose. Recycled water is used for irrigation, industrial cooling towers, and commercial needs ranging from athletic fields to hockey rinks. The tertiary treatment process takes up to two days. Capital costs range from $400 to $500 an acre-foot.\u0094 Like LVMWD, the district does not serve residential accounts.\n\nThe Santa Clara Valley Water District partnered with the cities of San Jose and Santa Clara to build the Silicon Valley Advanced Water Purification Center, a $72 million facility which came on line in 2014. It further treats tertiary water using microfiltration, reverse osmosis and ultraviolet light.\n\n\u0093Purified water has the potential to be used as drinking water,\u0094 Mr. Ashktorab says. \u0093The capital cost of purified water ranges from $1,000 to $1,200 an acre-foot.\u0094 Levi\u0092s Stadium, home to the NFL\u0092s 49ers, is irrigated with recycled water. In February, the San Jose Sharks hockey team hosted the Los Angeles Kings for an outdoor game at Levi\u0092s Stadium. NHL hockey rinks typically require 12,000 gallons of water to make the ice sheet. For this Sharks game, the equivalent of 7,500 low-flow toilet flushes generated the wastewater supply that was processed into recycled water, then ice. The Kings won, melting the Sharks\u0092 playoff aspirations. Mr. Ashktorab chuckled, \u0093The Sharks have since recycled their coach.\u0094\n\nNearer to natural ice on the western slope of the Sierra Nevada is the El Dorado Irrigation District (EID) in Placerville. EID\u0092s source water originates from the American River watershed. The district\u0092s service area spans 220 square miles and ranges in elevation from 500 feet at the Sacramento County border to over 4,000 feet. The district has maintained separate irrigation and reclamation water distribution lines in El Dorado Hills since the late 1970\u0092s. In 1989, it worked with Serrano Partners to develop a recycled water system from the Deer Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant, a tertiary treatment facility. In 2013 the eistrict sold over 29,000 acre-feet of potable water and nearly 3,200 acre-feet of recycled water to 4,000 accounts.\n\n\u0093We\u0092ve been in the recycled water business forty years,\u0094 says Mary Lynn Carlton, director of community relations. The recycled water system requires miles of pipeline and a network of storage reservoirs, tanks, and pump stations. Recycled water is delivered to home yards using a dual plumbed system, where purple pipe carries recycled water separately than drinking water pipes to homes. \u0093Recycled water rates are based on use and may range from $28 to $230 bi-monthly,\u0094 says Jesse Saich, public information officer for EID.\n\nFarms dominate the landscape as one travels into the Northern Sacramento Valley. Marysville, in Yuba County, is the county seat. The area is known for growing rice and tree crops such as plums, peaches and nuts. The city\u0092s population is less than 15,000.\n\n\u0093We considered using recycled water ten years ago,\u0094 says Dave Lamon, city services director. \u0093We collaborated with Yuba City and a nearby water district to determine if local facilities could upgrade to tertiary treatment. They could, but the more significant issue was marketing recycled water. We only have the summer season to sell it. That\u0092s the inherent difficulty for a product made 365 days a year.\u0094\n\nCommunities further north in the Sacramento Valley rely on municipal treatment plants or on-site septic systems to process wastewater. In the foothills east of Chico, the town of Paradise relies on surface water stored behind Magalia and Paradise Dams. Source water includes runoff from Little Butte Creek, a small tributary of the Sacramento River.\n\n\u0093We treat and deliver surface water to our customers in the Town,\u0094 says George Barber, general manager for the Paradise Irrigation District. For wastewater disposal the majority of town citizens use septic systems.\n\n\u0093The drought focused us to maximize the use of our current water supply,\u0094 adds Mr. Barber. \u0093In a normal year we use about 7,000 acre-feet of water for urban, residential and landscaping needs. We\u0092re developing a proposal to reuse up to 600 acre-feet of process water by upgrading our water treatment plant. We\u0092ll push hard to get Prop 1 funds but worry that the State doesn\u0092t accept our approach as true water recycling.\u0094\n\nChico, nestled between the Sacramento River and foothills, has little ability to recycle wastewater. About fifteen percent of Chico\u0092s 37,000 households rely on septic systems. \u0093The city\u0092s wastewater treatment plant provides secondary treatment,\u0094 says James Carr, wastewater treatment plant manager. \u0093We\u0092re located five miles down gradient from the city. We\u0092d need to upgrade the plant to a tertiary system and build a separate distribution system to pump recycled water into town. Costs would be many millions.\n\n\u0093We are reviewing our system though,\u0094 adds Mr. Carr, \u0093and reuse some effluent on-site at the plant.\u0094 The city presently treats six million gallons per day, about 7,000 acre-feet of wastewater annually. Effluent is discharged into the Sacramento River.\n\nChico\u0092s drinking water, groundwater, is provided by the California Water Service Company. Pete Bonacich, acting director for California Water Service-Chico, offers ideas to recycle wastewater. \u0093We can build small on-site wastewater reclamation stations near parks or golf courses for irrigation needs,\u0094 he says.\n\nWater reuse is a high priority for the Glenn-Colusa Irrigation District (GCID), the largest agricultural district in the Sacramento Valley. GCID supplies water to nearly 140,000 acres of irrigable land and another 5,000 acres for habitat. The district\u0092s source water is diverted from the Sacramento River. \u0093We don\u0092t recycle our water per se, like municipalities that reclaim wastewater. Instead, we recapture tail water through gravity diversion sites and pump stations,\u0094 says Pat Kennedy, water operations superintendent. Tail water is water that passes through fields after initial irrigation deliveries. \u0093In 2014 we recaptured approximately 23 percent of our water. That amount varies depending on supplies from Lake Shasta. In the past we\u0092ve reached 30 percent. Water is reused multiple times before leaving the system.\u0094\n\nStringent environmental regulations get public agencies thinking about their water and wastewater infrastructure.\n\nThe Rio Alto Water District, located south of Redding between Interstate 5 and the Sacramento River, provides water and sewer services to its customers. The drinking water source is groundwater.\n\n\u0093Our customers recognize that wastewater treatment is expensive,\u0094 says Martha Slack, general manager. \u0093In 2010 the Regional Board imposed a Cease and Desist Order on our effluent discharges to the Sacramento River which were high in zinc and chlorine byproducts. In 2012 our Board of Directors formed a community facilities district. Two-thirds of our voters agreed to a special tax on all sewer parcels to fund plant improvements. We then applied for loans and grants and partnered with the Wintu Audubon Society, an organization that focuses on restoring natural ecosystems. Our plant was upgraded to tertiary treatment capable of processing 700,000 gallons per day (800 acre-feet annually) to near drinking water standards. Customers wanted trails. The District bought land adjacent to the Sacramento River and reconstructed wetlands to further polish effluent through percolation. The project should be completed by October.\u0094\n\nAnd costs to customers? Ms. Slack responds, \u0093The maximum annual tax per household for the first twenty years is $289. They drop to $212 after our State loan is paid off. It\u0092s our cost of doing business to treat wastewater.\u0094\n\nCalifornia\u0092s statehood coincided with a severe drought. Future droughts will undoubtedly new challenges. Scarcity requires that economic decisions are made to efficiently allocate resources. The market rate for undeveloped water transferred throughout California this year has ranged from $700 to nearly $2,000 per acre-foot. Those numbers are starting to look like numbers wastewater recycling can compete with.\n\nAbout the author\n\nEric Miller is based in Chico and serves on the Butte County Groundwater Technical Advisory Committee and the Chico Urban Water Group.
