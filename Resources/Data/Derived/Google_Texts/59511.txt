Although Mexican immigrants comprise just 4 percent of the U.S. population, they represent 13 percent of all uninsured people, according to a study by UCLA, UC-Berkeley and the Mexican government.

The number of uninsured Mexicans living in the U.S. has increased from 3.3 million in the mid-1990s to 6.4 million, the report said. Nearly 12 million people who were born in Mexico were living in the United States last year.
