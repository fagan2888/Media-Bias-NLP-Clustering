Inspira reduced its average callback time from 20 minutes to a matter of seconds in most cases, authors write, while improving patient and provider satisfaction by reducing noise.\n\nSeveral departments also set up automated appointment reminders to decrease manual calls and follow-ups, sending relevant information to the users preferred format (phone, text message or email), according to the article. This prevents alert fatigue among patients and allows them to easily confirm or reschedule appointments.\n\nThe health system plans to use more automated alerts and text messaging in the future, as well as integrating an app that allows doctors to send or receive HIPAA-compliant information by either computer or personal devices, authors write. Nurses will also be able to contact doctors through secure texts rather than pagers, reducing noise levels even further.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n5 steps to quiet damaging hospital noise\n\nNoisy hospitals pose patient safety risks\n\nReduce noise to improve OR communication, prevent errors\n\nHospitals rank alarm fatigue as top patient safety concern", "article_metadata": {"description": "One hospital instituted a new way to tackle old\u00a0noise problems that pose safety risks to patients\u00a0by using technology to enable more direct communication between caregivers--eliminating many noise sources, according to a\u00a0Hospitals & Health Networks\u00a0article.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "One hospital instituted a new way to tackle old\u00a0noise problems that pose safety risks to patients\u00a0by using technology to enable more direct communication between caregivers--eliminating many noise sources, according to a\u00a0Hospitals & Health Networks\u00a0article.", "title": "Hospital reduces damaging noise with direct communication technologies", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/hospital-reduces-damaging-noise-direct-communication-technologies/2014-07-16", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "direct communication,Health Information Technology,hospital noise,Noise Reduction,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes,Text Messaging", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Health Information Technology,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbb74\"", "article_summary": "To learn more:- here's the articleRelated Articles:5 steps to quiet damaging hospital noiseNoisy hospitals pose patient safety risksReduce noise to improve OR communication, prevent errorsHospitals rank alarm fatigue as top patient safety concern\nSo, the health system replaced its broadcast system with direct communication between physicians and patients--doctors can be reached on their cell phones, as well as customized messages.\nOne hospital instituted a new way to tackle old noise problems that pose safety risks to patients by using technology to enable more direct communication between caregivers--eliminating many noise sources, according to a Hospitals & Health Networks article.\nNurses will also be able to contact doctors through secure texts rather than pagers, reducing noise levels even further.\nInspira reduced its average callback time from 20 minutes to a matter of seconds in most cases, authors write, while improving patient and provider satisfaction by reducing noise."}
