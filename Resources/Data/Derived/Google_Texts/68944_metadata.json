What projects are you working on? One of my biggest projects is working on a community project with Maataam Naka Shin and the Southern California Tribal Chairmen\u2019s Association to develop a phone/pad application, \u2018Indigenous San Diego,\u2019 which provides an interface for users to learn about publicly available San Diego area tribal museums, indigenous exhibits in museums, cultural trails, tribal lands and preserves, Native businesses, methods to share about their sacred stories, places to gather, art exhibits, and community meetings. The application is being created to support the nonprofit educational purposes of Maataam Naka Shin. Nikke A. Alex visiting the reservation lands of the Viejas Band of Kumeyaay Indians near San Diego, CA. Another project I am working on is writing for Procopio's Blogging Circle. The Procopio Blogging Circle is created by the Procopio Native American Practice Group, its friends and its colleagues. Blogging Circle is a forum to share legal news and ideas affecting Native American Communities. (https://bloggingcircle.wordpress.com/<a/) How will this help with your career goals? My summer with Procopio has helped me network with Southern California tribes and Native attorneys in the area. I went into law school wanting to practice Environmental Law, Water Law, & Indian Law, and my experience with Procopio has reaffirmed my path. What\u2019s your background? I grew up in Northern Arizona and New Mexico in the Navajo Reservation. After receiving my undergraduate degree from the University of Arizona, I attended graduate school at UCLA. I wanted to attend UNM Law School for the Natural Resources and Environmental Law Program.\n\nWhat projects did you work on? All the firm\u2019s clients are Indian tribes, entities, or individuals. The projects I worked on involved legal research to support expert rebuttal reports for a claims mismanagement case, to provide a cultural, historical, and economic background of a tribe that was a potential new client, to provide legal analysis for numerous issues, such as condemnation of allotted lands, evolving marijuana laws, taxation of an off-reservation service provider to Indians on-reservation, and much more. I wrote numerous memoranda and a Motion to Bifurcate. Research and writing are by far the majority of the work I do. How will this work help with your career goals? Working at the firm helps with my career goals because the work of Johnson Barnhouse & Keegan is exactly what I want to do after I graduate. The firm is not subject-specific. It represents all Indian clients on a plethora of legal issues. As a result, the work is continually challenging. I am continuing my employment with the firm as my summer clerkship worked out well for both the firm and for me. I am happy there and fit in well. I received a lot of fantastic feedback from great lawyers at this firm, about the law and about law school. I never intended on working at a firm when I began law school; however I didn\u2019t know that an Indian law firm like JB&K existed. The firm does amazing work in Indian Country. In fact Jemez Pueblo, represented by the firm, just prevailed at the Tenth Circuit on an important case regarding Aboriginal title. What\u2019s your background? I am Choctaw and Blackfeet. My home is Browning, Montana (I am from Hawai\u2019i and lived in other states), but I will stay in New Mexico and practice. I met my wife here and she is from Santa Fe. This is a fantastic place to be for Indian law. I have a Bachelor of Science in Anthropology from University of Oregon and a Master of Arts in Anthropology from University of New Mexico.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "UNM, UNM School of Law, News, Office of Career Services, Indian Law, Tribal Law, Internships", "google-site-verification": "suDeBu3cQ5JEfYn92UdyZqkDPVCRI3QFK4dbV1tzUNk", "description": "Students work in Indian Law for private firms this summer", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "author": "Jim Williams and Stevie Nichols"}, "article_summary": "I went into law school wanting to practice Environmental Law, Water Law, & Indian Law, and my experience with Procopio has reaffirmed my path.\nI never intended on working at a firm when I began law school; however I didn\u2019t know that an Indian law firm like JB&K existed.\nI wanted to attend UNM Law School for the Natural Resources and Environmental Law Program.\nI received a lot of fantastic feedback from great lawyers at this firm, about the law and about law school.\nThe Procopio Blogging Circle is created by the Procopio Native American Practice Group, its friends and its colleagues."}
