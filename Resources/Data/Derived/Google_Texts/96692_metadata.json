The 16-year-old had been cheering for the Sebring Middle School team and had liked it.\n\nWilliams was receptive and Mackenzie was selected at the tryouts.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s just one of us,\u201d Williams said. \u201cShe\u2019s very involved.\u201d\n\nMackenzie admitted being a little nervous at the first two games, and to make sure she\u2019s in step, watches Caylie\u2019s moves if she needs to.\n\nIt\u2019s also been a little tiring, but she\u2019s learned many new routines - and especially loves doing pep rallies.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a natural,\u201d Caylie said with a smile and does great splits.\n\n\u201cBetter than you,\u201d Mackenzie grins and both the girls start smiling. Caylie doesn\u2019t disagree.\n\nAn impish girl who loves to banter around and invariably leaves people laughing, Mackenzie has done more for the team than she realizes, Williams said.\n\nWhen things get stressed out, trust Mackenzie to break the tension, she said.\n\n\u201cIt has been a special bond,\u201d she said. \u201cIt has helped the girls. We all look out for her. She makes us laugh.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sat, 05 Oct 2013 21:23:32 -0400", "Description": "AVON PARK \u2013 In many ways, Mackenzie Riffle is a regular, bubbly 16-year-old high school girl.", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "AVON PARK \u2013 In many ways, Mackenzie Riffle is a regular, bubbly 16-year-old high school girl.", "title": "Avon Park cheerleader brings special touch to team", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/news/education/avon-park-cheerleader-brings-special-touch-to-team-20131005/", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20131005/ARTICLE/131009446/EP/1/1/EP-131009446.jpg", "height": 1333}, "updated_time": "2013-10-05T21:23:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "AVON PARK \u2013 In many ways, Mackenzie Riffle is a regular, bubbly 16-year-old high school girl.", "title": "Avon Park cheerleader brings special touch to team", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20131005/ARTICLE/131009446/AR/0/AR-131009446.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2013-10-05T21:23:32Z-04", "modified_time": "2013-10-05T21:23:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe55f5\"", "article_summary": "AVON PARK \u2013 In many ways, Mackenzie Riffle is a regular, bubbly 16-year-old high school girl.\n\u201cI like cheerleading.\u201dCaylie, whose mother has been teaching Mackenzie dance at CenterStage Dance Studio in Avon Park, came up with the idea after chatting with Mackenzie\u2019s sister.\nShe can talk incessantly about boys, likes to laze around in front of the TV, especially when Nick Teen\u2019s \u201cH2O\u201d and Fox Network\u2019s \u201cGlee\u201d show is on, and loves to cheer for the Avon Park High School varsity cheerleading team.\nShe\u2019s the only special needs cheerleader Avon Park High has had since Williams has been coaching and will be cheering for all the home games this year because her parents thought she might get too tired at the out-of-town games.\nMackenzie, who has been going to dance classes since she was a child and can do killer splits, has Down Syndrome."}
