Fox News anchor Greta Van Susteren, appearing today on the "This Week" powerhouse roundtable, savaged President Obama for his last scheduled press conference of the year, calling him "pathetic."

"The president's most powerful weapon as president has been his ability to inspire, that's his greatest strength and then he comes out last Friday in the press conference, he was depressing, he was like, pathetic, he sucked the oxygen out of the room, the media beat up on him, the media had bad questions, they kept punching him," Van Susteren said.

"I mean, he ends the year where you just want to slit your throat almost because it was so depressing, and he's completely lost his ability to inspire," she said.

On Friday, Obama - who has been dogged by low poll numbers - addressed the troubled roll-out of his signature health care law, the Affordable Care Act, saying, "We screwed it up."

He did look to 2014, however, saying: "When I look at the landscape for next year, what I say to myself is we're poised to do really good things."
