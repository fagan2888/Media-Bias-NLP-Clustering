However, the discussion that the general public is often privy to regarding these changes is usually limited to only the popular issues, such as the Affordable Care Act, Planned Parenthood, and abortion. Politicians have a proclivity to highlight only these headlines, as campaigns can leverage the controversy to create their own brand and dogmatic factions, based on the sides that they take. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that these topics only provide a prima-facie glimpse into American health care, and that there are a multitude of lesser-known issues that are as poised to deeply impact the future of medicine.\n\nOutlined below, are three such neglected topics that will take the center stage of health care politics in the years to come. Although this list is by no means comprehensive, it provides a robust survey to better inform the curious citizen:\n\nTort Reform\n\nSomething which was once the most highlighted topic in the evening news, the subject of tort reform has now taken a back seat to other issues. However, this is an issue that everyone should strive to learn more about, as it changes the entire landscape of provider liability. Essentially, tort reform refers to changes in law that will enforce a limit on the liability faced by health care providers. Certain states have extended these laws to limit the amount providers will have to pay out for non-economic damages, or damages for \"pain and suffering,\" caused by a malpractice or tort claim. It is important to recognize both sides of this issue. The proponents of tort reform contend that without it, physicians are forced to practice defensive medicine. This entails a slew of extra procedures and tests to ensure that the provider doesn't accidentally miss something. The costs of these extra tests are passed on to the patients and insurance companies, thus increasing the overall cost of health care. The other side of the debate states that tort reform is detrimental to the apt compensation of the injured party for its \"pain and suffering,\" a liability which can't always be quantified and limited to a specific dollar amount. Whichever side one may endorse, the issue is ultimately important to keep in mind as it is a direct factor of national health care costs.\n\nThe Competitiveness of Medical Training\n\nThe medical education system in America is extremely competitive, as physicians must generally pursue a minimum of 11 years of education after high school in order to become fully licensed. The demand for health care providers is higher than it has ever been in American history, with severe shortages all over the nation. However, the amount of residency training programs, which physicians must complete to become licensed, cannot keep up with the increased supply of medical students trying to enter the workforce. As reported by the National Resident Matching Program, the 2015 residency \"match\" entailed more than 41,000 applicants for a little over 30,000 trainings spots. Some have called this artificial deflation, curtailing the amount of doctors that can enter the workforce, at a time when the country needs more providers. This cap on physician entry into the market place also increases costs, as health care \"supply\" remains low in the market. However, others endorse this method, as the stringent requirements to start and maintain a residency program are likely why American physicians are universally recognized for their high competency and skill levels.\n\nTelemedicine\n\nHealth care systems become erratic as disruptive innovation is introduced to the industry. One such innovation is telemedicine, a novel concept that has been sweeping across American hospitals for the past few years. Essentially, telemedicine is the use of media and technology to allow physicians to practice their trade digitally; for example, a surgeon in California may be invited by video conference to oversee and proctor a procedure in New York. His presence may be limited to just a consultation, or, with the use high resolution cameras, he may actually be able to point out and dictate the required protocols. More physicians are becoming accustomed to this concept, as it provides access to instant consultations and expertise in niche areas. However, the concept may have even larger implications for the health care system as a whole. As more hospitals invest in these systems, telemedicine could serve to partly remedy the physician shortage that many rural American cities are facing. While procedures will still need physical presence, general practitioners and providers can do consultations and meet with patients over the screen. It may take years to work out the kinks and perfect the system, but this may be the key to providing truly universal access to health care around the country.\n\nIt is evident from just these three issues that the ongoing debates about health care are by no means comprehensive. Rather, the public must be aware that there are many different factors which are working backstage to contribute to our changing health care system. As election season is in full swing and more debates and topics regarding health care will surface, it will be important to note which candidates spend time discussing the above, less illuminated, but equally crucial issues.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In what has been declared by many as a \"crisis,\" the American health care landscape has been undergoing a vast array of changes over the past decade.
