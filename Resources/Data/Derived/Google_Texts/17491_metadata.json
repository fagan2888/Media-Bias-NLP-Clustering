Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) failed to stand out from his fellow \"undercard\" rivals for the GOP nomination.\n\nNot so at Wednesday night's debate in Simi Valley, California, where the national security hawk put on a much more aggressive and energetic performance -- characteristics he is known for in conversations with reporters in the halls of Congress.\n\nIt wasn't so much the substance of Graham's arguments, which critiqued President Barack Obama's policies with respect to the Iran deal, radical Islam, Syria, and Russia.
