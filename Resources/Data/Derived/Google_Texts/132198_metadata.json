This was his first year as a part of the program. (Dan Barker/ Fort Morgan Times)\n\nThe 4-H shooting sports program helps keep children safer if they use guns.\n\n\"Children that know about guns don't get hurt by guns,\" said Karl Dahle, superintendent of the shooting sports events.\n\nOn Saturday, he was conducting the .22 rifle shooting competition at the Morgan County Gun Club shooting range. The event was a pre-Morgan County Fair event.\n\nLearning about guns in a disciplined way tends to spill over into the rest of the kids' lives, said Rich Clough of Fort Morgan, an assistant superintendent.\n\nThey often take that discipline into school and other areas of their lives, he noted.\n\nThe participants at the event were required to take a gun safety class and had chances to practice every other week for the past few months, Dahle said.\n\nLane Goodman, 14, of Fort Morgan tries out a small telescope he uses to see how close he comes to the target. He was at the Morgan County Fair .22 rifle shooting sports event Saturday, but he also competed in muzzle loaded rifle, air pistol and air rifle. He's participated in shooting sports for five years. (Dan Barker/ Fort Morgan Times)\n\nA crucial part of the training is to learn the safe handling of guns of any kind, he said, as well as learning techniques for accuracy.\n\nKids also must complete a project related to shooting, such as poster displays that show what they know or making equipment that they can use, Clough said. They must keep record books about their experiences and what they have done, and at the end a judge interviews them about their projects and record books to find out what they have learned.\n\nShooting is truly a lifelong sport, Dahle said. It is not like football, in which few people participate after high school or college.\n\nHe said that his son, Adam, competed against a gold-medal Olympian shooter, who won his medal in 1964, which shows how long the sport can last in a person's life.\n\nThis year, shooting sports had more than 30 4-H members involved, Dahle said.\n\nQuite a few of them had been a part of the program before, he said.\n\nThere has been a lot of interest, especially among the junior-level kids, which are kids 8 to 13 years old, Clough said.\n\nThat includes girls, as well as boys, and historically girls are good shooters, he said.\n\nRich Clough of Fort Morgan, right, runs through the safety rules with the kids who competed in the shooting sports event on Saturday. (Dan Barker/ Fort Morgan Times)\n\nOne of the shooters on Saturday was Kami Sweenie, 16, of Brush. This was her first year in the program. She said it caught her attention because her brother and father were involved with shooting sports, and it looked like fun.\n\n\"It is,\" Sweenie said.\n\nFor her project, she is making a bag to put her coat, glove, stand and roll in, she said.\n\nIf a kid stays at it, he or she can win scholarships to colleges, Dahle noted. One local girl received a full-ride scholarship to a Nebraska college based on her shooting skills.\n\nNot expensive\n\nKids do not have to own guns or other equipment to participate, Clough explained. They can use the 4-H equipment, and just have to pay a few dollars for ammunition at practices.\n\nSweenie said she uses the program's guns, and it is not that expensive to pay for the ammunition.\n\nMorgan County's shooting sports program has been fortunate to receive Friend of the NRA grants for the past four years, which has paid for equipment, Dahle said.\n\nAlso, local businesses donated money for the program this year to buy a trailer to haul all the equipment, Clough said.\n\nKids cannot take the guns home, but they are always available at practice, Dahle noted.\n\nSafety\n\nBefore the .22 shooting event began, Clough went over the safety rules with the participants, getting the kids to tell him what they meant.\n\n\"Safety is always No. 1,\" one of the kids said.\n\nAlways treat a gun as if it is loaded, keep the muzzle of the gun pointed in a safe direction, keep the action open until ready to shoot and keep your finger off the trigger until ready to shoot, others chimed in.\n\nClough emphasized that anyone could call a cease fire at any time. They might do that if they noticed something wander into the path of the shooting, or a farmer drive into view.\n\nResults\n\nAdam Dahle and Lane Goodman led all 4-H shooters in .22 competition, at the senior and junior levels respectively, said a release from the Morgan County Extension Office.\n\nIn junior hunting rifle competition, Lane Goodman captured first place, Nicolas Clark took second place; Brynden Wilson took third; Noah Clough took fourth and Kyle Wellen won fifth.
