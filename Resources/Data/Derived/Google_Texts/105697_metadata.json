And, small scraps can get caught in cans and jars,\n\nSo rather than tearing a piece of paper into small scraps to remove identifying information such as your name, address, account numbers, etc. in an effort to protect your private information, simply mark through that information or tear off what you fear might be compromised.\n\nFor the most part that is not an issue because of the way those materials are collected, sorted and sent through the recycling process.\n\nAdditionally, shredded paper should not be put in your curbside single stream recycling cart for the same reason \u2014 it's difficult to separate it from other recyclables in the sorting plant. Shredded paper can be taken to the Loveland Recycling Center or to the landfill's drop-off site and placed in the office paper roll-off. The paper in those containers is put through the baler at the landfill as they are all pretty much the same type of paper.\n\nPut the shredded paper in loose and not in paper or plastic bags.\n\nQuestion: What about tissue paper and facial tissues?\n\nAnswer: Facial tissue cannot be recycled. The fibers are too weak to be turned into usable paper. The same applies to paper towels, coffee filters, tissue paper and other similar types of paper.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you have comments or questions, email rwatson@larimer.org or call 498-5772.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/columnists/patty-packrat/ci_26517352/paper-recycling-dos-and-donts", "modificationDate": "2014-09-13T10:54:33-0600", "sailthru.section": "Patty Packrat", "sailthru.author": "By Patty Packrat", "description": "Question: Is it OK to put small pieces of paper in with my recyclables?\n\n\nAnswer: If the scraps of paper are very small, it can be difficult for them to be sorted out at the recycling sorting plant.", "ag": {"canon": "LovelandReporter-Herald:article:26517352:view"}, "startDate": "2014-09-13T10:54:20-0600", "og": {"url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/columnists/patty-packrat/ci_26517352/paper-recycling-dos-and-donts", "image": "http://local.reporterherald.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/reporterherald.png", "type": "article", "description": "Question: Is it OK to put small pieces of paper in with my recyclables?\n\n\nAnswer: If the scraps of paper are very small, it can be difficult for them to be sorted out at the recycling sorting plant.", "title": "Paper recycling do's and don'ts"}, "twitter": {"domain": "reporterherald.com", "description": "Question: Is it OK to put small pieces of paper in with my recyclables?\n\n\nAnswer: If the scraps of paper are very small, it can be difficult for them to be sorted out at the recycling sorting plant.", "title": "Paper recycling do's and don'ts", "url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/columnists/patty-packrat/ci_26517352/paper-recycling-dos-and-donts", "image": "http://local.reporterherald.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/reporterherald.png", "site": "@reporterherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-09-13T10:54:20-0600", "endDate": "2024-09-13T10:54:20-0600", "sailthru.title": "Paper recycling do's and don'ts", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "byline": "By Patty Packrat", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "XzsHDcJw4iXBQEYtDXFRaUAdKzxhSvxWMgXyQQNFFzg", "sailthru.site": "reporterherald.com", "pubDate": "2014-09-13T10:56:11-0600", "news_keywords": "Loveland ReporterHerald Colorado columnists opinion"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0a94\"", "article_summary": "The same applies to paper towels, coffee filters, tissue paper and other similar types of paper.\nShredded paper can be taken to the Loveland Recycling Center or to the landfill's drop-off site and placed in the office paper roll-off.\nPut the shredded paper in loose and not in paper or plastic bags.\nAnswer: If the scraps of paper are very small, it can be difficult for them to be sorted out at the recycling sorting plant.\nQuestion: What about tissue paper and facial tissues?"}
