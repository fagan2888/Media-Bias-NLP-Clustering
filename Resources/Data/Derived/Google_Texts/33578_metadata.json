Obamacare? It becomes this endless loop,\u201d said an incredulous Obama. \u201cIt\u2019s not serious. It\u2019s not speaking to the real concerns that people have.\u201d\n\nIt was a rare moment where the president\u2019s frustration with the GOP\u2019s incessant focus on his political weaknesses bubbled to the surface.\n\nRepublicans have spent recent weeks pummeling Obama and his administration over the 2012 attack in Libya that took place on Obama\u2019s watch. For Obama, the renewed focus on Benghazi, where four Americans died, only replaces one headache with another; until recently, Republicans had been laser-focused on pushing repeal of Obama\u2019s unpopular health law as a way to score points with voters in November.\n\n(TM and \u00a9 Copyright 2014 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.
