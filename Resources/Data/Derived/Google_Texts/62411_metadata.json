The larger hospitals have internal controls and procedures in place, he said.\n\nThe new focus on the solo practitioner and small practice groups means these practices will have to identify and fund best practices to prepare for a potential investigation.\n\nBezanson recommends that practices take a look at billing practices, procedures and test recommendations to the extent they are written down. They should also set up internal guidelines for consistency within a group practice.\n\n\"That can send a strong message to regulators,\" said Bezanson.\n\nMost large providers are used to dealing with the risk of fraud and already have internal controls and compliance plans in place, according to Bezanson and Verisk Health Chief Medical Officer Richard Wheeler, a family physician who has practiced 25 years at Kaiser and Duke in North Carolina and worked as a medical director for Blue Cross Blue Shield in the fraud unit.\n\n\"Providers have been made more and more aware of the crackdown on fraud over the past decade,\" Wheeler said. \"It's escalated over the past two to three years. I'm not convinced these big cases mean as much to big providers, they're usually clear of fraud. It's the smaller groups where there will be the bigger impact.\"\n\nThe announcement also means the Department of Justice may be more open to looking at cases dealing with the more subtle issue of \"honest fraud,\" whether a procedure is one of medical necessity, according to Wheeler.\n\nTwitter: @SusanMorseHFN", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/lawyer-fraud-crackdown-physicians-ramping-so-be-prepared", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/man-sitting-in-prison-cell-feature.jpg", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "The healthcare industry is now getting the scrutiny that financial institutions and other publicly traded companies have experienced, said Phil Bezanson, a partner at Bracewell & Giuliani in Houston.", "title": "Lawyer: Fraud crackdown on physicians ramping up, so be prepared"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/man-sitting-in-prison-cell-feature.jpg"}, "description": "The healthcare industry is now getting the scrutiny that financial institutions and other publicly traded companies have experienced, said Phil Bezanson, a partner at Bracewell & Giuliani in Houston.", "site": "@HC_Finance", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Lawyer: Fraud crackdown on physicians ramping up, so be prepared"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "With federal investigators planning to crack down on Medicare fraud among smaller providers and physician practices, the healthcare industry is now getting the scrutiny that financial institutions and other publicly traded companies have experienced, said Phil Bezanson, a partner at Bracewell &amp; Giuliani in Seattle.", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe21df\"", "article_summary": "\"That was very much a shot across the bow,\" said Bezanson, whose firm does defense work in healthcare fraud cases.\n\"Providers have been made more and more aware of the crackdown on fraud over the past decade,\" Wheeler said.\nOne example has been the recent highly publicized, coordinated arrests of over 240 doctors, nurses and other licensed medical professionals in a $700 million healthcare fraud sweep focusing on alleged Medicare Part D fraud.\nI'm not convinced these big cases mean as much to big providers, they're usually clear of fraud.\nBezanson recommends that practices take a look at billing practices, procedures and test recommendations to the extent they are written down."}
