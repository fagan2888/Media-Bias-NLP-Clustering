Or did they intend for it to be a living document that would endure and adapt to ages they could not yet fathom?\n\nTomorrow\u2019s Viewpoints page tackles the argument from both sides. Columnist George Will warns that we are wise to be wary of a \u201cdismaying intimation of a \u2018living Constitution\u2019 too malleable to limit government because it conforms to whatever shape serves transitory political and cultural impulses.\u201d\n\nBloomberg\u2019s Noah Feldman, meanwhile, says the framers hoped to create a living document that would work for all time. Says Feldman: \u201cThe organism is alive.\u201d\n\nLastly, we have another contribution from the great Sean Petrie of Typewriter Rodeo, who urges us on this Independence Day to \u201cJust Breathe.\u201d\n\nHe writes:\n\n\u201cDemocracy is so, so alive.\n\nAnd we are governed not by long-dead men\n\nBut by a wondrous document that lives\n\nAnd calmly\n\nBreathes\n\nAs we move forward.\u201d\n\nWell-said, Sean.
