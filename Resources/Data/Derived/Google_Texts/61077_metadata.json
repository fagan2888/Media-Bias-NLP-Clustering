Rick Perry in moving in the other direction. Meanwhile, Ohio Gov. John Kasich is a big supporter of the Medicaid expansion that was part of the Affordable Care Act; but Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker argues it will simply make more people dependent on government. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul is trying to roll back surveillance programs; New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie warns that doing so could weaken national security.\n\nAs candidates step forward to debate these and other issues, they won\u2019t just be campaigning to lead the party; they\u2019ll also be seeking to define it. Here are some key areas of dispute:\n\nCommon Core\n\nThe education standards were relatively noncontroversial in 2012. Forty-five states had adopted them, although Gov. Rick Perry announced that summer that Texas wouldn\u2019t. Now, most of the Republicans who once supported Common Core are backtracking amid a revolt on the right.\n\nTwo years ago, Jindal\u2019s staff was reportedly pushing for a state law to help implement the standards. This summer the Louisiana governor sued the federal government to block them. Walker and Christie both oversaw Common Core\u2019s implementation in their states. Walker recently promised to push for full repeal, and Christie has a commission exploring the standards\u2019 effectiveness \u2014 giving him an out.\n\nA major exception among the gubernatorial class eyeing 2016 is Bush. The former Florida governor has traveled across the country promoting Common Core and has called opposition to the standards \u201ctroubling.\u201d Kasich also still supports the standards and chastised people who call them \u201cObamaCore.\u201d\n\nTed Cruz of Texas, Marco Rubio of Florida and Paul of Kentucky, all senators considering White House runs, have spoken out against the standards, with Cruz and Paul promising to push for congressional action against them. Paul has declared that any supporter of Common Core \u201cprobably doesn\u2019t have much chance of winning in a Republican primary.\u201d\n\nEven though the business community still backs Common Core, which grew out of a bipartisan National Governors Association initiative, Gallup has found surging opposition among GOP parents, up from 42 percent in April to 58 percent in October.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an issue that isn\u2019t sexy enough for D.C. folks, but at the grass-roots level, it\u2019s a very big deal and will be a measuring stick for all these guys,\u201d conservative strategist Keith Appell said.\n\nNSA eavesdropping\n\nAlmost all Republicans rallied to then-President George W. Bush\u2019s defense when it came out during his second term that he secretly allowed the National Security Agency to do warrantless surveillance of foreigners\u2019 communications with Americans. But in 2013, the leaks by Snowden revealed that the agency\u2019s efforts went far beyond what was already known, generating huge debate over how much surveillance is too much.\n\nPerhaps no potential 2016er has capitalized more on the Snowden affair than Paul, whose libertarian leanings have energized that wing of the GOP. The senator has sued the federal government to stop bulk collection of Americans\u2019 data. In the process, he has run headlong into what might be called the Dick Cheney wing of the party, which never apologizes for the government doing anything that could stop a terrorist attack on U.S. soil.\n\nThe USA Freedom Act just failed during the lame-duck session. It would have ended the National Security Agency\u2019s bulk collection of metadata but also extended parts of the PATRIOT Act into 2017. Cruz supported the bill as a compromise, but Paul voted against it because he said he didn\u2019t want to extend the PATRIOT Act. Rubio also voted against the bill, but for the opposite reason: He warned that it would weaken national security.\n\nSome of the governors considering 2016 runs also have taken Paul\u2019s position on the NSA to task by framing it within the broader issue of protecting the country, especially amid spreading turbulence in the Middle East.\n\nIn the summer of 2013, Christie suggested Paul failed to understand the danger of terrorism, saying that those who challenge surveillance programs should hear from the relatives of Sept. 11 victims. Walker has said he is somewhere \u201cin between\u201d Christie and Paul on NSA wiretapping. He, as most other candidates probably will, called for \u201ca balanced approach.\u201d\n\nMedicaid expansion\n\nBack in 2012, the GOP presidential candidates all ran promising full repeal of the president\u2019s health care law. It was a particularly tough stance for eventual nominee Mitt Romney, who was pilloried during the primaries because the health care plan he created as Massachusetts governor also had an individual mandate.\n\nThis time, several GOP governors who might run will take heat for expanding Medicaid under Obamacare. The expansion option comes with the promise that Washington will cover the full cost the first few years and 90 percent of it thereafter.\n\nChristie couldn\u2019t turn down the free money, and he expanded Medicaid with the strong support of his Democratic-controlled state legislature. Kasich in Ohio is maybe the most aggressively pro-expansion Republican in the 2016 mix. He makes a biblical case for giving people health care and circumvented his own GOP legislature to get it done.\n\nBoth men are very vulnerable on their right to Medicaid attacks \u2014 there\u2019s a strong sense among the grass roots that the federal government won\u2019t live up to its promise on providing funding and that expanding Medicaid will make it harder to repeal the overall health law.\n\nJindal and Perry strongly oppose Medicaid expansion. Although Walker has warned against government dependency, he has pushed his own version of state-funded expansion. It resulted in thousands of existing Medicaid patients getting kicked off and told to join Obamacare exchanges instead, but it also threw open the doors to thousands of the state\u2019s poorest residents.\n\nThe candidates at the congressional level have been opposed to Medicaid expansion across the board. Cruz says expanding Medicaid will take \u201cmoney away from teachers, roads, water, and other vital programs.\u201d Paul was quoted telling a local paper in January: \u201cWe have to get people off Medicaid, not on Medicaid.\u201d\n\nImmigration\n\nTwo years ago, the GOP primary debate over immigration reform was more abstract. There had been no surge of children crossing the border, no call from the Republican National Committee to pass comprehensive immigration reform, no bill passed by the Senate and no executive action taken by the president to protect up to 5 million undocumented immigrants from deportation.\n\nIn 2016, Republican candidates will have these developments to chew on and probably more. They\u2019ll be asked whether they want to renew the threat of deportation for millions, and they\u2019ll be asked if they support the Senate immigration reform bill. In all likelihood, the immigration issue could prove a minefield for several likely candidates.\n\nPerry was badly hit on immigration last time because he backed in-state college tuition for undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children. Rubio championed the bipartisan Senate bill \u2014 with the idea it would be a big-ticket accomplishment for a likely presidential bid \u2014 but it died in the House and he has since tried to separate himself from it. Some have suggested they are open to reform but not the Senate version.\n\nChristie has steadfastly refused to articulate his position. \u201cThere\u2019s no upside to me at this moment, to be candid, to discuss it,\u201d he said in September.\n\nDemocrats will be keen to highlight immigration because they view it as a way to increase the Latino vote in key swing states such as Nevada, Colorado and Florida. Romney was crushed among Latinos last time after he lunged to the right by urging \u201cself-deportation.\u201d\n\nThe GOP donor class wants immigration reform; it wants more high-tech visas and doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s realistic to deport millions of people. Big-picture strategists worry the party won\u2019t win general elections if it keeps alienating Latinos. But activists in early states such as Iowa and New Hampshire see illegal immigration as a scourge and want nothing beyond securing the border.\n\nGay marriage\n\nOhio Sen. Rob Portman, who mulled a 2016 run, came out in support of same-sex marriage last year after being inspired by his openly gay son. Although Portman announced this week he won\u2019t seek the White House, there\u2019s still likely to be debate about the issue in a way there wasn\u2019t in 2012.\n\nWatch the tone. The Republican establishment doesn\u2019t want to talk about gay marriage, knowing that many major donors, not to mention younger people, support gay rights.\n\nBut several would-be candidates need strong support from evangelicals in Iowa and South Carolina to have any path to the nomination. It\u2019s easy to imagine former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee or former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, who need these voters, calling out other candidates for appeasing the gay rights lobby.\n\nCruz last month slammed the Supreme Court\u2019s decision not to take up lower court rulings that overturn gay marriage bans in several states, calling it \u201ctragic and indefensible.\u201d The senator has suggested that he will introduce a constitutional amendment that would prevent the federal government or courts from invalidating state bans on gay marriage.\n\nChristie has said he\u2019s still personally opposed to same-sex marriage but that the issue is \u201csettled\u201d in New Jersey. He dropped a lawsuit trying to stop such marriages on the grounds that he didn\u2019t want to waste taxpayer money. Walker is in a similar boat, saying he supports Wisconsin\u2019s ban but acquiescing to legal decisions that have rendered it null.\n\nIn 2012, Ron Paul (Rand Paul\u2019s father and a libertarian icon) was the only GOP presidential candidate not to sign the National Organization for Marriage\u2019s pledge promising to fight for traditional marriage. The group plans to issue a pledge again but does not know who will sign this time around.\n\n\u201cWe will certainly oppose any Republican who chooses to go against the party\u2019s platform on this issue,\u201d NOM spokesman Joseph Grabowski said.\n\nKyle Cheney contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "2016 Republicans disagree on surveillance, gay marriage, Common Core.", "title": "The new GOP divide", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/12/republican-fault-lines-113232.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/12/01/faultlinestype.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Obamacare,Gay Marriage,2016 Elections,Scott Walker,Jeb Bush,GOP,Bobby Jindal,Republicans,Common Core,John Kasich,Immigration,Chris Christie,Rand Paul,Marco Rubio,Medicaid,NSA,Ted Cruz", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "2016 Republicans disagree on surveillance, gay marriage, Common Core.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcf23\"", "article_summary": "2016 elections The new GOP divide 2016 Republicans disagree on surveillance, gay marriage and Common Core.\nHe makes a biblical case for giving people health care and circumvented his own GOP legislature to get it done.\nPerhaps no potential 2016er has capitalized more on the Snowden affair than Paul, whose libertarian leanings have energized that wing of the GOP.\nIn 2016, Republican candidates will have these developments to chew on and probably more.\nThis time, several GOP governors who might run will take heat for expanding Medicaid under Obamacare."}
