At the end of 2005 the current-account deficit reached 6.2% of GDP, the sign of a society living dangerously beyond its means. But by the third quarter of 2013 it had dropped to 2.2%, the lowest since 1998, a level it could easily sustain indefinitely.\n\nThe current account deficit should never be a major concern as the flows must balance out over time \u2013 one way or another. But what made this post interesting to me was the discussion of the decline in imports \u2013 which were attributed to:\n\nlower oil imports and higher domestic production of oil;\n\nthe demographic shift of boomers from spending to saving;\n\nmore favorable dollar and rising foreign labor rates favor USA over foreign production.\n\nThis post was accompanied by the following graphic:\n\nAdding to this story, it is very obvious that imports have been stagnating. The graph below is based on current dollar \u2013 and shows there has been no growth since 2007 (which means inflation adjusted growth has contracted) just as the graphic above suggests.\n\nAlthough the Economist post talks about oil production being up in the USA (and therefore requiring less oil imports), the driving factor historically was price (not the quantity of oil being imported). For the last two years, oil imports had little effect on the growth or contraction of imports.\n\nRemember the good ole days when most believed the USA was going to be manufacturing nothing within a few years. Although China is now the world\u2019s number one manufacturer, this was not at the expense of destroying USA production.\n\nSo the USA\u2019s production is now growing at approximately its historical rate of growth, and manufacturing employment has returned to growth \u2013 growth in manufacturing employment has not occurred since the 1990s.\n\nI have blamed free trade agreements for the decline of manufacturing employment from 2000 until the Great Recession. The days of the free trade agreements sucking jobs out of the USA are over for a variety of reasons (primarily logistics).\n\nAs the above chart shows, there is now a slight growth in employment in the manufacturing sector as manufacturing returns to the USA. However, the new dynamic in employment is robotics \u2013 and this dynamic will likely grow stronger in the coming years. Dynamics are funny things, and can change momentum and direction with few noticing. For now, I consider this THE dynamic to watch in jobs growth.\n\nGoing forward in 2014, the shrinking growth in imports is at least signalling that the USA economic growth is becoming more balanced between what is being produced domestically and what needs to be imported.\n\nOther Economic News this Week:\n\nThe Econintersect economic forecast for January 2013 predicted a slowing economic growth after several months of increasing growth. What this forecast cannot see is the effect of Obamacare \u2013 but slowing of growth in this forecast was primarily the result of the business sector.\n\nThe ECRI WLI growth index value has been weakly in positive territory for over four months \u2013 but in a noticeable improvement trend. The index is indicating the economy six month from today will be slightly better than it is today.\n\nCurrent ECRI WLI Growth Index\n\n/images/z weekly_indexes.PNG\n\nInitial unemployment claims went from 339,000 (reported last week) to 330,000 this week. Historically, claims exceeding 400,000 per week usually occur when employment gains are less than the workforce growth, resulting in an increasing unemployment rate. The real gauge \u2013 the 4 week moving average \u2013 improved from 357,250 (reported last week) to 349,000. Because of the noise (week-to-week movements from abnormal events AND the backward revisions to previous weeks releases), the 4-week average remains the reliable gauge.\n\nWeekly Initial Unemployment Claims \u2013 4 Week Average \u2013 Seasonally Adjusted \u2013 2011 (red line), 2012 (green line), 2013 (blue line), 2014 (orange line)\n\n/images/z unemployment.PNG\n\nBankruptcies this Week: none\n\nWeekly Economic Release Scorecard:", "article_metadata": {"google-site-verification": "81mKPeNoK2AdXUzIIgladUq0VieusTnqUAUxuRpnjes", "blogcatalog": "9BC9564332", "description": "A new economics based website.
