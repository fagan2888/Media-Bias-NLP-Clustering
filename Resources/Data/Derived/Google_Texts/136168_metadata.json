Any deal beyond the current arrangement is still months away.\n\n\"We haven't designed that resolution yet. But this is something that's quite doable,\" Rice said. The United States does not want Iran to be \"in a position to race towards a bomb undetected.\"\n\nRice said it was still unclear if Iran was hurting enough from existing sanctions on its oil exports and other industries to give up its nuclear ambitions in a \"verifiable way.\"\n\n\"We don't know. But the other half of the answer is we have every interest in testing that proposition,\" she said.\n\nUnder November's interim agreement, Iran agreed to curb its nuclear program for six months in exchange for limited relief from sanctions.\n\nThe Obama administration has clashed with Congress over the sanctions issue; many lawmakers want to impose tougher sanctions on Iran.
