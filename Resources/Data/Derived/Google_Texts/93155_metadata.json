Moreover, many companies lack the internal technology necessary to carry out the recordkeeping, enrollment, and reporting requirements that are legally necessary to be compliant with the law. These tools enable companies to successfully manage the administrative requirements of the ACA, including eligibility tracking, notifications to employees, enrollment, standardizing of reports, and monitoring the latest changes to the ACA.\n\nThe ACA Navigator guides employers through each aspect of the employer coverage mandate of the ACA. The ACA Compliance Module provides eligibility tracking for all employees, sends monthly notifications to employees and human resources staff, and monitors the latest changes to the ACA to ensure companies have the information to stay in compliance.\n\n\"EBenefits Solutions offers a robust set of integrated solutions to help companies comply with many aspects of the ACA,\" said Toksu. \"Our processes save time, and eliminate what could be costly mistakes. That way companies can focus on what they want to think about --- staying competitive and growing their businesses.\"\n\nFor more information, call 1-866-353-0984 or email info@ebenefits.com.\n\nAbout EBenefits Solutions\n\nEBenefits Solutions was founded in 2005 following the success of the program in supporting the benefits administration needs of its parent company, UPMC, the premier integrated health care delivery system in western Pennsylvania.
