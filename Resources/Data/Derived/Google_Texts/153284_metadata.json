Toth and his team further divided the rural patients into those living in large, small and isolated areas.\n\nComparing rural and urban patients based on follow-up visits, emergency room visits and unplanned readmissions in the first 30 days after hospital discharge, researchers found those in isolated rural areas were 19 percent less likely than their urban counterparts to receive follow-up care. They also found a 44 percent higher risk of ED visits for patients in small rural areas and a 52 percent higher risk for those in large ones.\n\nRisk of readmission was not significantly higher for those living in rural areas than those in urban areas, but when Toth and his team looked at the numbers by hospital location rather than residency, those in large and small rural areas were 32 percent and 42 percent more likely to be readmitted, respectively.\n\nThese findings, Toth said in a statement, backed up existing research that Medicare's Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program disproportionately penalizes rural providers.\n\nNow healthcare leaders must look into what drives these disparities, he added. For example, are patients at rural hospitals discharged to under-resourced settings or are there gaps in post-discharge instructions?\n\nBipartisan legislation introduced earlier this year proposed to incorporate sociodemographic data into the formula for calculating readmission rates, FierceHealthcare previously reported.\n\n\"This recalibration ensures hospital performance is compared equally while maintaining an incentive for all hospitals to reduce unnecessary readmissions,\" American Hospital Association Executive Vice President Rick Pollack wrote.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the study abstract\n\n- here's the statement\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nAHA calls for changes in hospital readmission penalties\n\nEarly follow-up reduces readmissions of high-risk patients\n\nBill would factor demographics into readmission penalties\n\nReadmission penalties reach record high\n\nHospital performance not the driving force in readmissions\n\nReadmission reduction: A losing battle?\n\n3 ways to make readmission policies fair for hospitals\n\nHospitals that reduce readmissions still hit with penalties\n\nEarly results show slow progress in CMS readmissions programs", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rural Medicare patients have lower rates of follow-up care after discharge, an important safeguard against preventable readmissions and other complications, according to a new study published in Medical Care.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Rural Medicare patients have lower rates of follow-up care after discharge, an important safeguard against preventable readmissions and other complications, according to a new study published in Medical Care.", "title": "Rural patients less likely to receive follow-up care after discharge", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/rural-patients-less-likely-receive-follow-up-care-readmissions-ER-visits/2015-08-17", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "30-day readmissions,Care Delivery,Demographics,emergency room visits,follow-up visits. care coordination,Healthcare Disparities,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes,rural hospitals,urban hospitals", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "article_summary": "Comparing rural and urban patients based on follow-up visits, emergency room visits and unplanned readmissions in the first 30 days after hospital discharge, researchers found those in isolated rural areas were 19 percent less likely than their urban counterparts to receive follow-up care.\nRural Medicare patients have lower rates of follow-up care after discharge, an important safeguard against preventable readmissions and other complications, according to a new study published in Medical Care.\nToth and his team further divided the rural patients into those living in large, small and isolated areas.\nThese findings, Toth said in a statement, backed up existing research that Medicare's Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program disproportionately penalizes rural providers.\nThey also found a 44 percent higher risk of ED visits for patients in small rural areas and a 52 percent higher risk for those in large ones."}
