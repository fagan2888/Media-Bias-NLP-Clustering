There were, however, some pretty important things to know about this group of men and one woman \u2014 Carly Fiorina \u2014 who have a shot at becoming our next Commander in Chief. Here are our top 10 moments, complete with GIFs for your viewing pleasure.\n\nThere is a massive dispute on whether or not Ted Cruz is eligible to be president.\n\nThe once brewing bromance between Donald Trump and Ted Cruz appears to be over, as the former reality television star went on the attack against Cruz for being born in Canada.\n\n\"Back in September, my friend Donald said he had his lawyers look at this in every which way, and there was no issue there,\" Cruz said. \"There was nothing to this birther issue. Since September, the Constitution hasn't changed. But the poll numbers have,\u201d referencing his rise in the polls against Trump.\n\nMembers of the GOP have long (and falsely) claimed that President Barack Obama was not eligible to be president, pushing conspiracy theories for years over whether or not Obama was a natural born citizen of the United States.\n\nThe GOP frontrunner still thinks political correctness is best left out of politics.\n\n\"We have to stop with political correctness,\" Trump said, speaking on his unconstitutional call to discriminate against Muslims based on their religion and ban them from immigrating to the United States.\n\n\"All Muslims, seriously? What kind of signal does that send to the rest of the world?\" Jeb Bush asked, reminding Trump that Arab nations are needed to build a coalition to defeat ISIS.\n\nThere are 1.6 billion people of the Islamic faith in this world, let's not lump everyone together out of fear.\n\nThere were promises to overturn President Obama\u2019s historic efforts on gun control.\n\n\"I am convinced that if this president could confiscate every gun in America, he would,\" Marco Rubio said while promising to overturn Obama\u2019s actions to require background checks on people who purchase guns. \"I am convinced that this president, if he could get rid of the Second Amendment, he would.\"\n\nFor all of the candidates' talk about fear, the one thing they absolutely do not want you to fear are the weapons which killed 13,352 people last year. Obama is not attempting to take away anyone\u2019s guns; the measures he put in place enable us to better control who obtains them moving forward.\n\nTed Cruz won't hesitate to jump into another war.\n\nWhen asked about jobs, Cruz changed course and dove into the 10 U.S. sailors who were temporarily detained by Iran on Tuesday. Government officials confirmed on Thursday that the crew had entered Iranian territorial waters by mistake after a navigational error.\n\nCruz is ready for war, however. \u201cAny nation that captures our fighting men will feel the full force and fury of the United States of America,\u201d he asserted.\n\nAmerica is finally making progress in fixing its long fractured relationship with Iran. This is no time for fighting words. A mistake was made, we apologized, and no one was hurt.\n\nThe environment does not need to be protected.\n\nMarco Rubio has a not-so-friendly history with the Environmental Protection Agency, and he made sure to throw a dig in on Thursday evening. \"Regulations in this country are out of control, especially the Employment Prevention Agency,\u201d Rubio joked, referring to the EPA.\n\nThe moderators did not ask a single question on climate change. At least this 15-year-old is doing something about it.\n\nDonald Trump claimed that police are the most \u201cmistreated people\u201d in the country.\n\nIn 2015, more than 1,000 people were killed by police in the United States. The deaths have led to global outrage and a spotlight on policing in this country. Whether you agree with the protests of the Black Lives Matter movement or not, deaths at the hands of police is at rate far higher than other developed countries and we can do better.\n\nRubio slammed Christie for allegedly donating to Planned Parenthood in the 1990s.\n\n\u201cOur next president has to be someone that un-does the damage Barack Obama has done to our country. It cannot be someone that agrees with his agenda. Because the damage he has done to America is extraordinary\u2026 If we don\u2019t get this election right, there may be no turning back for America.\u201d\n\nChristie denied the donation ever happened, but the International Business Times found a statement from Christie in 1994 to NJ.com, where he said, \"I support Planned Parenthood privately with my personal contribution.\" Christie says he was misquoted then.\n\nEither way, if you're a feminist \u2014 anyone, male or female, who supports equality and women \u2014 then you probably support Planned Parenthood. The women's healthcare organization provides care to a little over 4.5 million people every year, many of whom would otherwise not be able to afford it. These continued attacks against the organization have got to stop.\n\nRubio went after Cruz\u2019s tax plan saying it would hurt the elderly, and he\u2019s right.\n\nCruz has a plan to replace income tax with additional sales taxes, but retired people don\u2019t work, so they are hit with additional taxes without any offsetting benefits. Think about how your grandparents will be affected, and you, every time you'd purchase something subjected to this additional tax.\n\nThey really hate Obamacare, no matter what the facts are.\n\nRubio reiterated a popular Republican talking point that the Affordable Care Act is a \"certified job-killer\" and added, \"It needs to be repealed and replaced.\" The GOP often claims that the new laws would cause companies to hire fewer workers. The reality though is that the U.S. has added jobs every month since the Affordable Care Act went on the books in March 2010, according to Politifact.\n\nBonus points: The Affordable Care Act provides birth control with no copay to millions of women.\n\nRand Paul protesters interrupted the debate.\n\nA protest broke out toward the end of the debate with a chant of, \"We want Rand! We want Rand!\" Paul did not meet the polling numbers to make it to the main stage of the debate, and skipped the early debate to host a forum on Twitter instead. It seems he made the right choice, as he gained the second most Twitter followers during the debate after Trump. Perhaps the others should all stay home next time, too. We hear social media is pretty game changing in the 2016 race for the White House.\n\nRelated: Planned Parenthood Just Majorly Clapped Back Against the Group That Leaked Those Secret Videos", "article_metadata": {"description": "From birther claims to an increased sales tax, here are the top 10 moments from the sixth Republican presidential debate.", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2016", "author": "Cassandra Fairbanks", "og": {"site_name": "Teen Vogue", "description": "The gloves were off.", "title": "Top 10 Moments From Last Night's Republican Debate", "url": "http://www.teenvogue.com/story/top-10-moments-sixth-republican-debate", "image": "http://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/56986e4f37b60ab3458cec18/3:2/w_1200,h_630,c_limit/repub-debate.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "teenvogue.com", "description": "The gloves were off.", "title": "Top 10 Moments From Last Night's Republican Debate", "image": {"src": "http://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/56986e4f37b60ab3458cec18/master/pass/repub-debate.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@teenvogue", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"admins": 108943, "app_id": 1013284322017473}, "version": "1.28.0", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "keywords": "Republican Debate,Election 2016,Presidential Election,Debate,Republicans", "viewport": "user-scalable=no, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd91e0\"", "article_summary": "Either way, if you're a feminist \u2014 anyone, male or female, who supports equality and women \u2014 then you probably support Planned Parenthood.\nRelated: Planned Parenthood Just Majorly Clapped Back Against the Group That Leaked Those Secret Videos\nIt seems he made the right choice, as he gained the second most Twitter followers during the debate after Trump.\nThe once brewing bromance between Donald Trump and Ted Cruz appears to be over, as the former reality television star went on the attack against Cruz for being born in Canada.\nRubio slammed Christie for allegedly donating to Planned Parenthood in the 1990s."}
