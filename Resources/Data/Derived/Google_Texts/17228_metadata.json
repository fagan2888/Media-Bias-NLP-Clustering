(Photo: Spencer Platt, Getty Images)\n\nLeave wages alone\n\nIn 2014, the Democrats plan to push raising the minimum wage. If you didn't like Obamacare, you're going to hate this plan (\"Raising minimum wage a Band-Aid or real fix? Your Say\").\n\nRaising the minimum wage won't help poor people because as wages go up, the price of other items will follow to pay for the cost of increased wages. For the people not working, life will just get harder, and the middle class will fall further behind. And retired people, well, that's another story.\n\nRosemary Tomy; SaddleBrooke, Ariz.\n\nHow to revive Detroit\n\nI read, with a great deal of interest, the column by Laura Baverman, \"Detroit challenges young minds to improve city.\"\n\nThe idea of the city being energized by the creativity of young people is great, but what also needs to happen is that the expertise and experience of the older generation need to be tapped.\n\nI am certain that there are many former Detroiters who are extremely dismayed at the condition of their former city, and who would be willing to help. The older generation also has that \"staying power\"; they know Detroit will not be easy to resurrect, so they will also be in a position to offer creative solutions.\n\nPittsburgh, another \"rust belt\" city that was in trouble, managed to reinvent itself. Detroit will have to do the same thing.\n\nMaybe Detroit could cast itself as a formerly great industrial city, and have the necessary monuments to document same, but also then plug in, in some unique way, to the current information-based economy.\n\nHarry Toder; Springfield, Ky.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/Km0uxd", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "New views on week's top talkers", "og": {"site_name": "USA TODAY", "description": "New views on week's top talkers", "title": "Minimum wage, Detroit: Second look", "url": "http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2014/01/02/minimum-wage-detroit-your-say/4296657/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "New views on week's top talkers", "title": "Minimum wage, Detroit: Second look", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/21a89dc1fe55cf99b921ca1d0344910f111fa023/c=390-0-2388-1998&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/USATODAY/NG/opinion/2014/1/2/GTY837801588.jpg", "creator": "@usatoday", "site": "@usatoday", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "fb": {"app_id": 215046668549694}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Subjects/Economy", "gci-categories": "Subjects/Economy", "gci-asset-type": "story", "title": "Minimum wage, Detroit: Second look", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "opinion", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/62bf783840718ee7fdb5ba7ff7e63d4d5b51fb33/c=762-0-2262-1998/local/-/media/USATODAY/NG/opinion/2014/1/2/GTY837801588.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ee7a6816d2cce24ebbcc51585941398523cf3b93/c=390-0-2388-1998/local/-/media/USATODAY/NG/opinion/2014/1/2/GTY837801588.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8ea90ec3e0872b937ed35f06e56026c92aed4edc/c=240-0-2898-1998/local/-/media/USATODAY/NG/opinion/2014/1/2/GTY837801588.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a958f8a307af558654bc3f552ecd1a021e685386/c=0-150-3000-1842&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/USATODAY/NG/opinion/2014/1/2/GTY837801588.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-01-02T21:32:41-05:00", "shorthed": "Minimum wage, Detroit: Second look", "articleid": 4296657, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/39504f4149b217b1a0a5be514cb9785bbb82b266/c=0-150-3000-1842/local/-/media/USATODAY/NG/opinion/2014/1/2/GTY837801588.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f7633978bebc9bcdfb00faaddeb92ba8c720a631/c=936-0-2052-1998/local/-/media/USATODAY/NG/opinion/2014/1/2/GTY837801588.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "Detroit, bankruptcy, minimum wage, living wage, jobs, economy, revitalization, rust belt"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1e19\"", "article_summary": "If you didn't like Obamacare, you're going to hate this plan (\"Raising minimum wage a Band-Aid or real fix?\n(Photo: Spencer Platt, Getty Images)Leave wages aloneIn 2014, the Democrats plan to push raising the minimum wage.\nRaising the minimum wage won't help poor people because as wages go up, the price of other items will follow to pay for the cost of increased wages.\nRosemary Tomy; SaddleBrooke, Ariz.How to revive DetroitI read, with a great deal of interest, the column by Laura Baverman, \"Detroit challenges young minds to improve city.\"\nNew views on week's top talkersThe General Motors building located in downtown Detroit."}
