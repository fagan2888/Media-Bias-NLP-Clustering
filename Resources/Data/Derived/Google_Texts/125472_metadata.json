Some involve ping pong, others alligators. Some employ the fierce vocals of Beyonce Knowles, others the firepower of a Barrett M107 .50BMG combat rifle. Office seekers are pulling out all the stops to come up with an event that both shows the candidate\u2019s \u201cauthenticity\u201d and demonstrates his or her bona fide partying skills. We thought some of their efforts deserved recognition. Here is a look at some of the best and worst of political fundraising gimmickry.\n\nBest Gator Hunt\n\nPerhaps the best gator hunt would have been the one planned as a fundraiser for Florida Republican Governor Rick Scott, but it was cancelled. The $25,000 a person gator hunt had been scheduled for the fall, but complications arose. Florida limits the number of permits for this sort of hunt and the few that are issued are done so through a lottery. It would have required an awful lot of luck\u2014and some explaining\u2014 for the Florida Republican Party, the sponsor of the hunt, to score permits for every donor to the governor\u2019s campaign.\n\nBut nearby in Louisiana where more alligators reside than in any other state, a fundraising hunt for the reptile pest at $5,000 a head went forward. The Fund for Louisiana\u2019s Future, a Super PAC that supports Senator David Vitter (R-La.), threw a \u201cLouisiana Bayou Weekend\u201d promising \u201cCajun Cooking, Airboat Swamp Tour and Alligator Hunt\u201d with special guest, Senator Vitter. A photo posted on Vitter\u2019s Facebook page showed the star attraction surrounded by a bloody pile of dead gators.\n\nBest Way to Kill Three Birds with One Stone\n\nNow that Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) has finished his 21-hour marathon speech advocating for the defunding of the Affordable Care Act, he will be free to selflessly combine three October fundraising events for others in one visit to Iowa. He will deliver the keynote address at the annual Ronald Reagan Commemorative Dinner benefitting the Iowa GOP, speak at Rep. Steve King\u2019s (R-Iowa) annual Defenders of Freedom fundraiser, and join King for a pheasant hunt fundraiser, also on behalf of King. The pheasant hunt is a rite of passage for conservative candidates prior to the Iowa caucuses. Both Texas Governor Rick Perry and former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum hunted pheasants with Rep. King prior to the 2012 Iowa caucuses.\n\nBest Bang for your Bucks\n\nMinnesota Republican state Rep. Cindy Pugh drew donors with a \u201cGet Your Carry Permit With Cindy\u201d fundraiser. Donors could contribute to her campaign and simultaneously complete the short training course that is required by the state for applicants for a permit to carry a handgun in Minnesota. \u201cThis is an idea that my campaign team came up with as we were brainstorming ways to connect with my voters and my constituents and just heighten awareness about issues that are important,\u201d said Pugh.\n\nBest Concert\n\nBeyonce proved to be a Sasha Fierce bipartisan draw this summer. Senator Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Senator Bob Casey (D-Pa.) and Rep. John Shimkus (R-Ill.) all held fundraisers at the Verizon Center around the \u201cMrs. Carter World Tour.\u201d We don\u2019t know what donors to the Casey or Shimkus campaigns had to pony up for the coveted tickets, but Tim Kaine\u2019s campaign asked for $5,000.\n\nWorst Scheduling Conflict\n\nFlorida Attorney General Pam Bondi asked Governor Rick Scott to postpone the execution of a man who murdered two young women because it conflicted with her re-election kick-off event on September 9. When word of the changed execution date went public, Bondi conceded she should not have asked for a delay.\u201dThe planned execution of Marshall Lee Gore had already been stayed twice by the courts, and we absolutely should not have requested that the date of the execution be moved.\u201d This week the state\u2019s chief law enforcement officer promised she would never again postpone an execution for a campaign event.\n\nBest Use of Topspin Since Ping Pong Diplomacy\n\nSusan Sarandon hosted a $50 per person fundraiser for NY Democratic mayoral candidate Bill de Blasio at her Ping-Pong bar, SPIN, last month. De Blasio lost in a fierce battle with his popular and telegenic son, Dante, but not before he engaged in a little trash talk, saying of the 15-year old, \u201cHe\u2019s all hair. No talent.\u201d\n\nBest Shooting Gimmick\n\nThere are plenty of shooting events to raise campaign cash, but this one distinguished itself by offering a variety of firearms along with two mystery rifles. A fundraiser invites participants to take a variety of shots on behalf of long shot Republican candidate for Senator from New Jersey, Steve Lonegan. (Lonegan is rising in the polls but still trails Cory Booker by 12 points.) The event, hosted by the New Jersey Second Amendment Society, promised \u201ca chance to try out some unique firearms while contributing to the Lonegan bid\u201d and the donation is based on your choice of weapon.\n\nA donation of $125 got you five rounds on the Barrett M107 .50BMG, a rifle described by the manufacturer as \u201cdriven by the demands of combat.\u201d Or for $20 you could shoot ten rounds off of a Ruger 10/22 .22, ideal \u201cfor informal target shooting, \u2018plinking,\u2019 small game hunting and action-shooting events.\u201d\n\nWorst Entertainment\n\nWhat could be more fun than listening to friends warble through Kelly Clarkson\u2019s \u201cStronger?\u201d How about paying to hand the microphone over to Rep. Mike Honda (D-Ca.) for an evening of karaoke? In fairness, his voice is kind of sweet. A staffer says the former Peace Corp volunteer who became fluent in Spanish while serving in El Salvador, favors songs sung in Spanish, especially those of Mexican singer \u201cChente\u201d Fernandez. The evening will cost you from $40 to 1,000 for VIP seating and placement in the rotation.\n\nBest Gathering of the Most Presidential Contenders (Outside of the Democrats\u2019 Annual Iowa Steak Fry)\n\nA fundraiser for the Republican National Committee co-hosted by New Jets owner Woody Johnson and RNC Chairman Reince Preibus boasted at least four potential presidential candidates. The line up included: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, Michigan Governor Rick Snyder, Senators Marco Rubio of Florida and Rand Paul of Kentucky.\n\nWorst Political GPS\n\nNewark Mayor Cory Booker was set to be in San Francisco for a fundraiser sponsored by San Francisco Young Professionals for Cory Booker on the same night as a Jersey City rally for his campaign. The New Jersey event was to be headlined by Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel and Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop. When the Lonegan campaign got wind of the scheduling conflict, Rick Shaftan, a senior adviser to Republican candidate Steve Lonegan responded, \u201cOf all the years I\u2019ve been in politics, I\u2019ve never heard of candidates not showing up to their own campaign rallies.\u201d Tragically a mass shooting in Chicago forced Emanuel to cancel and the New Jersey event was postponed.\n\nBest Festivus Celebration\n\nThis holiday soiree rated #1 mainly because we don\u2019t know of any other Festivus fundraisers. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor hosted this annual reception in 2010 and 2011 to benefit his ERIC PAC. And just like the fictional holiday (for the rest of us) created by George Costanza\u2019s father on Seinfeld, the celebration includes beloved family traditions such as a chance to \u201cair your grievances\u201d and the opportunity to attempt \u201cfeats of strength.\u201d If both freshmen Senator Ted Cruz and Senator John McCain show up, things could get interesting.", "article_metadata": {"description": "With the 2014 campaign expected to shatter previous midterm election spending records, now is the time for politicians to start shaking the money tree ever harder.
