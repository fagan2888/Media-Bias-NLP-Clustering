He even left the door open to further changing the rules so they would apply to more nominees.\n\n\"That precedent will always be there. It is hard to un-ring a bell and I think it was very damaging to the institution,\" said McConnell.\n\nBut in stopping short of endorsing filibuster reform for actual legislation, McConnell laid down a marker for how he would run the chamber that could end up upsetting his own members. Should, for example, Republicans emerge from November with a slim Senate majority, there will be a number of legislative items -- including, potentially, the repeal of Obamacare -- on which he will need 60 votes to end debate.\n\nIn his speech, McConnell cast his position as one of reverence for institutional history. The Senate, he said on several occasions, was designed as a place of legislative comity and deliberation. He placed the blame for changes to that culture at Reid's feet, citing his unwillingness to allow Republican amendments to be considered. (Reid's office has countered that the amendments in question are often poison pills, while noting that McConnell has spearheaded a historic number of filibusters).\n\nMcConnell pledged to create a more open amendment process should he end up majority leader. He also made the case for preserving the minority party's rights.\n\n\"I think the supermajority requirement in the Senate has been important for the country,\" he said. \"I think probably the biggest service the Senate has provided to America is the things it has not passed. Some of the proudest moments I can think of in my career are the things I have stopped.\"\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Mitch McConnell & Alison Lundergan Grimes Mitch McConnell & Alison Lundergan Grimes\n\n1 of 25 Mitch McConnell U.S. Senator Tom Coburn (R) holds a gun given to him by US Senate Minority Leader Senator Mitch McConnell during the American Conservative Union Conference on March 6, 2014 in National Harbor, Maryland.
