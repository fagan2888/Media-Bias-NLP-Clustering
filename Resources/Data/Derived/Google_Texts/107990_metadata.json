(Dana Verkouteren / AP)\n\nI know you\u2019ve heard this before, but this time the future of the Supreme Court really is up for grabs in the coming presidential election. By the time November rolls around, three of the justices\u2014Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Antonin Scalia and Anthony Kennedy\u2014will be octogenarians. Right behind them, Justice Stephen Breyer will be 78.\n\nUnless Father Time goes on permanent leave or the laws of nature are suspended, all four could resign on short notice, allowing the next occupant of the White House to appoint their successors.\n\nSince the average tenure of justices appointed since 1970 has exceeded 26 years, the next president will have the opportunity to reshape the nation\u2019s most powerful judicial body for a generation or more. And with the power to reshape the court will come the power to redefine the meaning and application of the Constitution.\n\nAdvertisement Square, Site wide\n\nIt\u2019s not only liberals and progressives like me or folks at watchdog groups like People For the American Way who are fretting about the direction of the court. If anything, conservatives are even more on edge.\n\nAt the Federalist Society\u2019s annual lawyers convention late last year, according to the Washington Times, seasoned Supreme Court litigator Michael Carvin voiced the angst shared by many on the right in the most dramatic terms, declaring: \u201cIf the election goes wrong \u2026 we will all descend into a hellish existence from which we will never emerge.\u201d\n\nCarvin\u2019s anxiety was echoed by professor Michael Paulsen, a constitutional scholar from the University of St. Thomas School of Law. \u201cIdeology matters,\u201d Paulsen told the crowd gathered at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington, D.C. \u201cJudicial philosophy matters. Sometimes it\u2019s literally a matter of life and death who[m] you appoint to the court.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s easy to understand such concerns. The replacement of even a single justice could swing the tribunal\u2019s voting balance on a variety of pivotal legal issues, prompting reconsideration of a host of recent, landmark 5-4 decisions. Since those decisions are a mixed bag, some liberal in outlook and effect and others conservative, both ends of the political spectrum have plenty of skin in the game of remaking the court.\n\nAmong the issues and cases most likely to be re-evaluated by a new panel of justices are these five headliners:\n\nCitizens United v. FEC, and Campaign Finance\n\nOf the plethora of pro-business rulings handed down since Chief Justice John Roberts assumed office in 2005, none has done more to consolidate the oligarchy\u2019s hold on government than the Citizens United decision of January 2010.\n\nIn his majority opinion, Justice Kennedy invoked the First Amendment and the legal fiction of corporate personhood to sweep away decades of legislative and judicial precedent that had prohibited corporations and unions from spending their general treasury funds on federal elections. Two months later, invoking the reasoning of Citizens United in the case of SpeechNow.org v. FEC, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit approved the formation of super PACs, the so-called \u201cexpenditure-only\u201d entities that cannot give money directly to candidates but can independently raise and spend unlimited sums on their behalf.\n\nIn 2014, in McCutcheon v. FEC, the Supreme Court struck again by a 5-4 margin, this time in an opinion penned by Roberts, lifting the long-established aggregate limits on the amount of money that wealthy individuals can donate directly to candidates in any given election cycle.\n\nBoth Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have vowed that, if elected, they will place justices on the court committed to reversing Citizens United, McCutcheon and presumably earlier rulings such as Buckley v. Valeo, decided in 1976, to limit the role of money in politics. Their opponents have promised to do exactly the opposite.\n\nHeller v. District of Columbia, and the Second Amendment\n\nPrior to Scalia\u2019s 5-4 paean to gun rights in 2008\u2019s Heller decision, the dominant view expressed both by academics and judges in the few court cases that addressed the issue was that the Second Amendment protected individual gun ownership only in connection with service in antiquated state militias. All that changed, however, with the triumph of Scalia\u2019s \u201coriginalist\u201d interpretation of the amendment, which asserts that the Founding Fathers intended to secure constitutional protections for the personal right to bear arms.\n\nAnd while the Heller decision was limited to gun ownership in the nation\u2019s capital and other federal venues, the court extended its analysis to the states two years later in McDonald v. Chicago.\n\nDespite being widely panned by Second Amendment experts such as Fordham University\u2019s Saul Cornell as a \u201cconstitutional scam\u201d based on a sloppy reading of colonial history, Scalia\u2019s originalism is now the law of the land, venerated as holy writ by every Republican presidential hopeful.\n\nBy contrast, Clinton\u2014and to a lesser extent Sanders\u2014supports such gun control measures as mandatory background checks, assault weapons bans, trigger-lock laws and prohibitions on cross-state, concealed-carry permits.\n\nSooner or later, the Supreme Court will take up another major firearms case. When it does, depending on who wields the gavel, Heller and McDonald could well be overturned\u2014or be further entrenched in the bedrock of our constitutional law.\n\nNational Federation of Independent Businesses v. Sebelius, and Obamacare\n\nIn what many conservatives regard as a great betrayal, Chief Justice Roberts authored the bitterly divided, 5-4 opinion that upheld the Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual mandate in 2012. What\u2019s largely been forgotten is that Roberts\u2019 opinion was anything but an enthusiastic endorsement of the ACA. The mandate survived, but barely\u2014and not as an exercise of the federal government\u2019s constitutional power to regulate interstate commerce, as the Obama administration had urged, but as a function of Congress\u2019 authority to levy taxes.\n\nSince then, the ACA has been repeatedly attacked, politically and legally. Last term, in a 6-3 decision (King v. Burwell), again written by Roberts, the court turned away a highly technical suit argued by Michael Carvin that sought to invalidate federal income tax subsidies for low-income purchasers of health insurance in states that have not set up their own marketplace exchanges.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "aca, affordable care act, anthony kennedy, antonin scalia, assault weapons, background checks, bernie sanders, bill blum, capital punishment, citizens united, concealed-carry, conservative, constitution, death penalty, democrat, donald trump, election, elena kagen, fec, first amendment, gay marriage, gop, gun control, gun violence, guns, hillary clinton, john roberts, liberal, marriage, obamacare, police, president, president obama, progressive, republican, ruth bader ginsberg, same-sex marriage, samuel alito, scotus, second amendment, sonia sotomayor, stephen breyer, supreme court, ted cruz, trigger-lock laws, white house", "og": {"site_name": "Truthdig", "description": "With a bench containing three octogenarians, the next president will have a historic opportunity to reshape the court.
