Peter Shumlin and Republican Scott Milne was so close it triggered an unusual provision of the Vermont Constitution that gives the state\u2019s 180 lawmakers the final say. A secret-ballot vote to decide who will govern the Green Mountain State for the next two years is scheduled for Thursday.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nMost observers expect the state\u2019s deeply Democratic legislature to grant Shumlin a third term. The vote in Montpelier this week is a result of a colonial-era provision of the Vermont Constitution that requires successful statewide candidates to win more than 50 percent of the vote. Although nothing binds lawmakers to choose the top vote-getter \u2014 this is the 25th time in history the vote has been kicked to the legislature \u2014 that\u2019s been the practice in every modern gubernatorial election.\n\nThat the race was close at all was just another blot on a miserable 2014 for Shumlin, who helmed Democratic efforts to win governorships before he nearly lost his own. As chairman of the Democratic Governors Association, Shumlin traveled the country as his party\u2019s top cheerleader for gubernatorial prospects \u2014 only to watch the best ones wilt and Republicans capture blue states like Maryland, Massachusetts and Illinois.\n\nIn his own race, Shumlin edged Milne by only 2,100 votes on Election Day, capturing 46 percent of the vote to Milne\u2019s 45 percent. Though the Vermont legislature hasn\u2019t supported a second-place finisher for governor since 1789, a creeping uncertainty has set in, as Republican anger and Democratic disenchantment with Shumlin seeps to the fore.\n\n\u201cPrecedent is only as good as until you establish the next precedent,\u201d said independent state Rep. Paul Poirier, a liberal who says he intends to vote for Milne.\n\nShumlin\u2019s frequent out-of-state travel helped opponents paint him as an absentee governor. His detractors also say the governor also exhausted his goodwill by pursuing a divisive agenda, botching the rollout of Vermont\u2019s Obamacare exchange and presiding over a period of stagnant middle-class wages and high property taxes.\n\n\u201cThat was reflected in the vote,\u201d said Vermont state House Speaker Shap Smith, a Shumlin ally who plans to support him Thursday. Smith said Shumlin deserves credit for helping Vermont recover from Tropical Storm Irene and for beginning to tackle increasing incidence of drug addiction. Unemployment has been declining, which should eventually correlate with rising wages, he added.\n\nBut Milne \u2014 underfunded and little-known \u2014 harnessed discontent around the state and helped frame the contest as a referendum on Shumlin.\n\n\u201cWe had a strategy which proved to be pretty effective,\u201d he said in a phone interview. \u201cThe more Peter Shumlin had to talk about Peter Shumlin, the more people didn\u2019t like it.\u201d\n\nMilne thinks he has a good case to make to state lawmakers, too. Shumlin squeezed by on Election Day, but that margin was inflated by his huge edge in the Burlington area. Milne appears to have won more state legislative districts, so if lawmakers simply vote based on their constituents\u2019 preferences, he argues, he\u2019ll prevail on Thursday.\n\nPoirier, the liberal state lawmaker, has pledged to do just that. The former House majority leader \u2014 who left the Democratic Party because he said it wasn\u2019t left-leaning enough \u2014 told POLITICO he plans to vote for Milne because of a personal friendship but also because Milne carried his district. Although he expects his colleagues to reelect Shumlin, Poirier says he\u2019s been fielding calls from incumbent Democrats who say they also intend to rebuke the governor.\n\n\u201cIn my dialogue \u2014 it\u2019s mostly with the left-of-center Democrats \u2014 they are furious at the governor,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are some people that have said to me they\u2019re going to turn around, vote for Milne, \u2018Hold my nose.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Shumlin and Milne camps, as well as the state Democratic and Republican parties, insist they\u2019re not making any serious efforts to lobby state lawmakers. Both candidates have publicly stated their positions, but there\u2019s no arm-twisting, they say. In part, that\u2019s because the vote is typically conducted by secret ballot.\n\nOn its face, the math is stacked against Milne. Republicans made gains in Vermont\u2019s newly-elected legislature but still hold only about a third of the 180 seats. Even if every Republican votes for Milne, about 20 Democrats and a slew of independents would have to join them to give Milne a majority.\n\nShumlin allies shrug off the notion that state lawmakers will vote their district rather than for the top vote-getter statewide.\n\n\u201cThe Governor believes that the legislature will honor the long democratic tradition in Vermont of selecting the candidate who received the most votes,\u201d said Scott Coriell, Shumlin\u2019s deputy chief of staff, in an email. \u201cAs he has said many times, he would not want to serve as Governor if he did not win the most votes from Vermonters.\u201d\n\n\u201cI guess it depends on whether you think of yourself as a trustee or a delegate of your voters,\u201d added Smith, the state House speaker. \u201cMy vote should be a reflection of what happened statewide.\u201d\n\nBut Shumlin may have given liberals added impetus to rebel when he announced late last month that difficult fiscal conditions forced him to shelve a long-touted plan to enact a single-payer health care system.\n\n\u201cShumlin\u2019s post-election retreat on single-payer has been a body-blow to single-payer advocates, who have always seen Shumlin as a steadfast ally,\u201d said Bertram Johnson, a political scientist at Middlebury College. \u201cTheir feelings of betrayal could lead to some interesting dynamics in the legislative vote this week.\u201d\n\nEric Davis, a Middlebury College political science professor, said Shumlin appeared to be caught off guard by the anger he was facing at home while he was out traveling the country.\n\n\u201cIf the GOP had been able to recruit a more politically experienced candidate, and if the [Republican Governors Association] had got involved in the \u2026 race, Shumlin might have gone down to defeat,\u201d he said in an email.\n\nThe RGA declined to comment on the extent of its efforts in Vermont, simply issuing a statement of support for Milne in Thursday\u2019s vote.\n\nThe larger question in Vermont is whether Milne\u2019s strong showing has helped revive a once-dominant Republican Party that was on the verge of extinction in recent years. Republicans won every presidential election in Vermont from 1856 to 1988, excepting Lyndon Johnson\u2019s landslide win in 1964. But since Bill Clinton\u2019s first victory, the state has been reliably Democratic.\n\nDemocrats scoff at the notion that Shumlin\u2019s close call is a sign of a GOP resurgence.\n\n\u201cIt is bluster coming from the other side,\u201d said Ben Sarle, a spokesman for the Vermont Democratic Party. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is a reflection on Democrats as a whole. \u2026 Gov. Shumlin, he got the message. The voters spoke and he won by thousands of votes still.\u201d\n\nMilne himself wouldn\u2019t rule out a run in two years.\n\n\u201cMy sense is that we\u2019ll look back on 2014 as a year where the Republican Party has brought Vermont back to a more balanced two-party state,\u201d he said.\n\nState GOP chairman David Sunderland agreed, arguing that the party hit its \u201clow point\u201d in late 2013 and has been on the upswing since.\n\nBut Milne\u2019s still likely to lose on Thursday, he added.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that the headwind against Scott Milne in the legislative vote is strong,\u201d he said.\n\nAuthors:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The November election triggered an unusual provision that gives lawmakers the final say.", "title": "Vermont legislature to pick next governor Thursday", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/01/peter-shumlin-scott-milne-vermont-governor-race-114051.html", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Vermont", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "The November election triggered an unusual provision that gives lawmakers the final say.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd4b1f\"", "article_summary": "POLITICO Pro Vermont legislature to pick next governor ThursdayTwo months ago, voters in bright-blue Vermont came within an eyelash of ousting their Democratic governor in favor of a rookie Republican businessman \u2014 and the race still isn\u2019t over.\n\u201cIt is bluster coming from the other side,\u201d said Ben Sarle, a spokesman for the Vermont Democratic Party.\nThough the Vermont legislature hasn\u2019t supported a second-place finisher for governor since 1789, a creeping uncertainty has set in, as Republican anger and Democratic disenchantment with Shumlin seeps to the fore.\nStory Continued BelowMost observers expect the state\u2019s deeply Democratic legislature to grant Shumlin a third term.\n\u201cThat was reflected in the vote,\u201d said Vermont state House Speaker Shap Smith, a Shumlin ally who plans to support him Thursday."}
