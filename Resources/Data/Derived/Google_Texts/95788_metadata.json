One question, however, always stops a conversation cold: Why are our reimbursements declining?\n\nAs important as it is for CFOs to keep their eyes on an issue like Meaningful Use, they simply cannot afford to be blindsided by declining reimbursements or denied claims. Indeed, unless they can flush out the reasons for a decline or denial, and quickly formulate a plan to combat it, some CFOs will be out of a job.\n\nIn today\u2019s healthcare environment, several factors typically contribute to overall reimbursement declines. On the payer side, significant Medicare and Medicaid fee schedule reductions have been accompanied by lower commercial plan rates. Provisions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) also must be taken into consideration. Readmission penalties, for instance, can cost hospitals as much as a three percent fee adjustment.\n\nTime is perhaps a CFO\u2019s biggest enemy. Discovering significant reimbursement declines and payment denials several months in\u2014regardless of cause\u2014can be crippling. Finance executives who rely on reports and spreadsheets that analyze days-old or even weeks-old data may have lost the reimbursement match without even realizing it.\n\nWhat is the right data?\n\nIf being proactive is the name of the game, then clean, accurate and current data is the main player. It is no longer enough just to have the \u201cright\u201d data; CFOs must be able to glean actionable intelligence out of constantly changing information. At the very least, they must have direct access to:\n\nfinancial data, such as labor costs, materials costs, accounts receivable (A/R) levels, and denial rates;\n\nclinical data, such as readmission rates and lengths of stay; and\n\nadministrative data, such as referral patterns, patient satisfaction scores, costs of service, and profitability levels by service line, by practitioner.\n\nYet data that is right today may not be right tomorrow, and more information is not necessarily better information. Some hospital and health system leaders are beginning to experience the drawbacks of unwieldy data warehouses that require them to submit queries and wait days or weeks for someone to deliver the results. Worse still: Sometimes they carefully formulate a query, await the results, and then realize after the fact that the requested report fails to tell them what they really need to know.\n\nTo facilitate data-driven decision making, every key piece of information should be directly accessible to CFOs, department leaders and other executives. Ideally, everyone in the C-suite should have a custom dashboard that provides access to critical key performance indicators whenever they need it.\n\nThe ability to combine financial, clinical and administrative data is another essential element, especially for executives aiming to change clinician behavior. Improving clinical documentation, for example, is usually an uphill battle; that is, until providers are shown the precise amount of money they are losing every week due to documentation shortfalls.\n\nThe type of predictive data analysis only possible with a fully integrated business intelligence solution gives CFOs and other executives the ability to peer into the root causes of reimbursement declines. Combining financial, clinical and administrative data and using it to derive predictive intelligence can help answer questions such as:\n\nHow much of the organization\u2019s commercial revenue is being written off as bad debt?\n\nShould the group recruit more orthopedic surgeons or more cardiac surgeons to improve the bottom line?\n\nWhich area physicians should be referring to the hospital, but aren\u2019t?\n\nWhich lines of service should be marketed for the highest return on investment?\n\nWhich patient experience factors have the greatest effect on ratings?\n\nWhat factors contributed to last month\u2019s rise in A/R levels?\n\nWhat would a three percent reimbursement decline mean for the overall financial health of the organization over the next two quarters?\n\nData and predictive analytics\n\nCFOs who feel like the rules have changed in the middle of the game are not alone. Understanding the general reimbursement landscape is not enough, nor can executives run their organizations on reports filled with months-old data for right now decisions.\n\nTraditional revenue cycle questions remain valid, but new questions about the relationships between costs and care quality also must be answered quickly, effectively and efficiently.\n\nWith a strong base of comprehensive data and advanced predictive analytics, CFOs can turn their financial ship on a dime. From revamping lines of service to bolstering referral sources or strengthening the revenue cycle, predictive analytics can help drive the decisions that quickly reverse\u2014or even prevent\u2014reimbursement declines and payment denials.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/blog/use-data-attack-declining-reimbursements", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/modules/open_graph/hfn-stacked.jpeg", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Chief financial officers at hospitals and health systems must track a multitude of difficult financial issues these days.
