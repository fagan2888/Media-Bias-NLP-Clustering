Palmer Land Trust received $300,000 from GOCO to preserve the remaining 1,135 acres of Wilson Creek Ranch, permanently protecting the entire 2,212-acre ranch. The City of Ca\u00f1on City was awarded $48,450 for eight weeks of Youth Corps work at Royal Gorge Bridge and Park.\n\nNearly half of Wilson Creek Ranch is visible along the Gold Belt Tour National Scenic Byway. The conservation easement will allow Wilson Creek to continue ranching cattle while also protecting wildlife habitat, four stream corridors, and providing public access for hunting and fishing.\n\nIn Ca\u00f1on City, crews of 16- to 25-year-olds from Mile High Youth Corps - Southern Front Range will help Royal Gorge Bridge and Park continue its road to recovery since the 2013 wildfire. Crews will construct two to three miles of new trails and plant 2,500 seedlings in the burn area.\n\nThe grant will be administered through the Colorado Youth Corps Association (CYCA). Youth Corps work in Colorado employs and trains 1,600 youth between the ages of 14 and 25 each year for land, water, and conservation work. Corps members earn a living stipend for their full-time service and an AmeriCorps education award to use toward college or trade school.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo date, GOCO has invested $3.5 million in Fremont County, supporting projects including Coal Creek Community Park, the Arkansas Riverwalk Trail, Hogbacks Open Space, and Pathfinder Park.\n\nGreat Outdoors Colorado invests a portion of Colorado Lottery proceeds to help preserve and enhance the state's parks, trails, wildlife, rivers and open spaces. GOCO's independent board awards competitive grants to local governments and land trusts, and makes investments through Colorado Parks and Wildlife. Created when voters approved a Constitutional Amendment in 1992, GOCO has since funded more than 4,500 projects in urban and rural areas in all 64 counties without any tax dollar support.\n\nFor more information, visit goco.org.\n\nCa\u00f1on City School Board meets this evening\n\nThe Ca\u00f1on City School Board meets for its final meeting of the year at 5:30 p.m. today at the Central administration Office, 101 N. 14th St.\n\nSuperintendent George Welsh will share information on the District Accountability Committee Data Analysis of Elementary Schools, and the board will consider adoption of File 715 - Grading/Assessment Systems.

Due to an unfortunate situation, he will need to find a new loving home as soon as possible. He speaks English well and is a delight to be around.\n\nASSE students have their own spending money and insurance and are able to share a room with another male child within four years of his age. He has come to America because it has been his lifelong dream. Organizers hope that someone in the Ca\u00f1on City area would open their hearts and home to this child. This will be an amazing experience for the host family and will provide a lifetime of memories for both the host family and the student.\n\nThose interested in hosting the exchange student for the remainder of the school year may contact Shelley Bruccoliere at (719) 659-2150 or shellbrucco@q.com.\n\nDaily Record Staff", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/ci_29245901/goco-awards-348-000-fremont-county-wildfire-recovery", "modificationDate": "2015-12-14T07:17:33-0700", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2015/1213/20151213__14DRBRFw~1_300.jpg", "endDate": "2025-12-13T15:46:10-0700", "description": "The Great Outdoors Colorado Board awarded two grants totaling $348,450 to Fremont County communities.", "ag": {"canon": "CanonCityDailyRecord:article:29245901:view"}, "startDate": "2015-12-13T16:23:58-0700", "og": {"url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/ci_29245901/goco-awards-348-000-fremont-county-wildfire-recovery", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2015/1213/20151213__14DRBRFw~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The Great Outdoors Colorado Board awarded two grants totaling $348,450 to Fremont County communities.", "title": "GOCO awards $348,000 to Fremont County wildfire recovery and land conservation"}, "twitter": {"domain": "canoncitydailyrecord.com", "description": "The Great Outdoors Colorado Board awarded two grants totaling $348,450 to Fremont County communities.", "title": "GOCO awards $348,000 to Fremont County wildfire recovery and land conservation", "url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/ci_29245901/goco-awards-348-000-fremont-county-wildfire-recovery", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2015/1213/20151213__14DRBRFw~1.jpg", "site": "@CCDR_news", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-12-13T16:23:58-0700", "sailthru.site": "canoncitydailyrecord.com", "sailthru.title": "GOCO awards $348,000 to Fremont County wildfire recovery and land conservation", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Canon City Breaking News, Sports, Weather, Traffic", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "oCjqPZ-ii-IZW-fBJ0mmX5dmH5aafePG3FLx_kSYFiA", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2015/1213/20151213__14DRBRFw~1.jpg", "pubDate": "2015-12-13T16:26:38-0700", "news_keywords": "Canon City news, Colorado news, world news, national news, local news, business news, sports news, entertainment news, us news, Canon City Daily Record"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2e17\"", "article_summary": "( Special to the Daily Record )Click photo to enlarge \u00ab1\u00bbGOCO awards $348,000 to Fremont County wildfire recovery and land conservationThe Great Outdoors Colorado Board awarded two grants totaling $348,450 to Fremont County communities.\nCa\u00f1on City School Board meets this eveningThe Ca\u00f1on City School Board meets for its final meeting of the year at 5:30 p.m. today at the Central administration Office, 101 N. 14th St.\nThe City of Ca\u00f1on City was awarded $48,450 for eight weeks of Youth Corps work at Royal Gorge Bridge and Park.\nOrganizers hope that someone in the Ca\u00f1on City area would open their hearts and home to this child.\nThe grant will be administered through the Colorado Youth Corps Association (CYCA)."}
