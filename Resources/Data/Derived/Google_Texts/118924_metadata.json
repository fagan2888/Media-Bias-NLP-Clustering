A session of what should be passionate love-making turns into an uncomfortable thrust and awkward facial expressions, leading some women to \u201cfake it\u201d to convince him, and perhaps themselves, that they had a good time. Dame Products, a sex toy company aimed at heightening intimacy and empowering sexual experiences of womankind, aims to bridge the \u201cpleasure gap\u201d with \u201cEva\u201d \u2014 a hands-free couples\u2019 vibrator to be used during sex.\n\nEva creators Alexandra Fine and Janet Lieberman, the women behind Dame Products, created this product to provide a solution to the most common bedroom woe for women \u2014 orgasm. \u201cClitoral stimulation is really important to a lot of women for their pleasure and enjoyment, and it\u2019s difficult to get during sex,\u201d Lieberman told The Daily Dot. \u201cUsually, you have to get it before or after. Women need a little more time to get to that moment, to touch and feel and kiss to get revved up a bit more. And a lot of the vibrator solutions on the market today don\u2019t allow partners to be close and intimate while using them.\u201d\n\nA survey published in the Journal of Sexual Medicine found about 15 percent of women participants reported that their latest sexual experience was \"not at all pleasurable\" or only \"a little\" pleasurable.\u201d This percentage was compared to the 4.3 percent of men who reported the same. The survey highlights the disparity in sexual pleasure that exists between men and women come to know as the pleasure gap.\n\nThe hands-free and strapless device is worn only externally and focuses primarily on the clit, since it\u2019s a huge factor in the pleasure gap. The product is designed to keep couples focused on each other without \u201cchanging the way sex feels.\u201d Fine and Lieberman addressed on Eva\u2019s IndieGoGo page, the hands-free vibrator is supposed to eliminate the \u201cawkward, tiring, or disruptive\u201d experience of clitoral stimulation during intercourse without lessening the guy\u2019s experience.\n\nHow \"Eva\" works in the vagina.

However, one challenge these devices face is fit. Dame used 3D printers to iterate prototypes quickly and explore various forms, which led them to create a functional shape that fits with a wide range of women. Although the product has been a success with most testers, according to Dame, it\u2019s important to remember no two vulvas are the same.\n\nRecently, We-Vibe, the first hands-free device that can be remotely controlled by an app, was released to allow couples turn their partners\u2019 vibrations on and off from wherever they are. The 3-inch-long U-shaped toy sits between the labia and stimulates the clit, while the other arms fit inside the vagina and can be used during intercourse. However, unlike Eva, it is worn internally.\n\nThese hands-free sex toys are just among several in the marketplace that aim to make sex more pleasurable for women. Eva, just like the We-Vibe, is designed to make women happy. \"We are trying to make the world a happier place, one vagina at a time,\" Fine told Refinery 29.\n\nCurrently, Eva is crowd-funding on IndieGoGo. The product has surpassed its $50,000 goal with about $148,000, with still 40 days left.
