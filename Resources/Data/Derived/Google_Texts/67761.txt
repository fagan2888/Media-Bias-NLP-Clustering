COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — Finland’s ruling conservative party has elected Foreign Trade Minister Alexander Stubb as party leader to replace outgoing Prime Minister Jyrki Katainen.

At a party congress Saturday, Stubb defeated rival social affairs minister Paula Risikko with 500 votes against her 349.

Stubb represents the liberal wing of National Coalition Party, the main government party in the five-party coalition.

The 46-year-old Finn will not be officially confirmed as prime minister until next week when the coalition meets to decide a government reshuffle.

Katainen, who has led the party since 2004, announced his resignation In April, explaining only that he was seeking a top post in Europe.
