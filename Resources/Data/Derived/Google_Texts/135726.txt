The Miracle Letter Program (MLP), a non-profit that helps local families in need, recently benefited from the "DaVita® Way of Giving."

DaVita HealthCare Partners, the leading independent medical group in America and leading provider of kidney care services, recently made a $1,000 contribution to Miracle Letter Program (MLP).

In December, DaVita Northeastern Colorado Dialysis presented MLP with a $1,000 check as part of the company's locally focused charitable giving initiative that helps nonprofit organizations throughout the United States grow and thrive.

The MLP is a project of the Santas of Sterling that provides assistance to northeast Colorado families facing a catastrophic event such as a serious illness, injury or disaster. Children or family members are encouraged to write a letter to Santa outlining the need and leave their application in the traveling candy cane mailboxes that are hosted by community businesses that partner with the MLP. The organization seeks to assist those who do not qualify for other assistance to help them through the difficult time.

DaVita HealthCare Partners teammates chose to donate to MLP because they have seen firsthand how this organization contributes to the community in unique ways.
