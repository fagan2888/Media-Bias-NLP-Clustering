Turkey claims that a Russian soldier stood with a rocket launcher on his shoulder on the deck of the landing ship Caesar Kunikov as it passed through Istanbul on the Bosporus. Published photos seem to back the claim.\n\nThe incident is the latest in a campaign by Russian President Vladimir Putin to punish Turkey for downing a warplane last month near the country\u2019s border with Syria. Turkish and U.S. officials say the jet had violated Turkish airspace and had been warned repeatedly to leave; Moscow says the aircraft received no warning and that Ankara planned the provocation.\n\nRelated: Putin: Turkey Buys Oil from ISIS, and Erdogan Knows All About It\n\nRussia has imposed a variety of economic sanctions on Turkey, and the feud has grown increasingly personal. Last week Putin accused Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his family of profiting from the sale of oil obtained from ISIS on the black market.\n\nThe events amount to Russia \u201cbasically trying to provoke the Turks into doing something rash,\u201d said Soner Cagaptay, director of the Turkish Research Program at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.\n\nIn Iraq, Turkish troops have been present for a while now but the picture has grown more complicated since Baghdad set up an intelligence sharing unit with Russia, Syria and Iran. This weekend the Iraqi government rebuked Turkey for sending hundreds of troops and military equipment near the ISIS-controlled city of Mosul. Turkish officials countered that the deployment was part of a standing rotation to train Kurdish fighters. Iraq has threatened to take the issue up with the United Nations, arguing its sovereignty has been impinged.\n\nRelated: Putin\u2019s New Missiles Dial Up the Tension with Turkey\n\nCagaptay said Russia and Iran, whose militaries are working together in Syria, in all likelihood told Iraqi officials to issue the warning to Turkey as a way to embarrass the country, though he predicted the matter wouldn\u2019t reach the United Nations.\n\nHe credited Ankara for \u201cplaying it cool\u201d in the face of the Kremlin\u2019s prodding, especially on the bomber incident, which has become more of a NATO-Russia affair, with officials from the alliance coming to Turkey\u2019s defense.\n\nRelated: Putin Pushes Back: How Russia Is Responding to Turkey\u2019s Downing of Fighter Jet\n\nHowever, Cagaptay predicted, Putin is going to keep trying to find a way to \u201cforce a full apology\u201d for the jet downing or \u201cat least humiliate Turkey so he can say \u2018This is what happens when you oppose Russia.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe added that while Ankara is going to find such counterattacks in \u201cthe most unexpected places,\u201d Russia can only go so far, give the size of Turkey\u2019s military and its ties to the West.\n\n\u201cPutin can only do so much, but he\u2019ll continue to do what he can to make headaches\u201d for the Turks, according to Cagaptay.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Moscow\u2019s is keeping up its multi-pronged retaliation against Turkey for shooting down a Russian fighter jet last month, sending a warship through the country\u2019s main maritime thoroughfare and trying to get Ankara in hot water with the United Nations", "title": "Putin Stirs the Pot in Turkey and Iraq", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/07/Putin-Stirs-Pot-Turkey-and-Iraq", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/12072015_Russian_Ship_Kunikov.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/07/Putin-Stirs-Pot-Turkey-and-Iraq", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/12072015_Russian_Ship_Kunikov.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Moscow\u2019s is keeping up its multi-pronged retaliation against Turkey for shooting down a Russian fighter jet last month, sending a warship through the country\u2019s main maritime thoroughfare and trying to get Ankara in hot water with the United Nations", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe35d6\"", "article_summary": "Related: Putin: Turkey Buys Oil from ISIS, and Erdogan Knows All About ItRussia has imposed a variety of economic sanctions on Turkey, and the feud has grown increasingly personal.\nTurkish officials countered that the deployment was part of a standing rotation to train Kurdish fighters.\nThis weekend the Iraqi government rebuked Turkey for sending hundreds of troops and military equipment near the ISIS-controlled city of Mosul.\nThe incident is the latest in a campaign by Russian President Vladimir Putin to punish Turkey for downing a warplane last month near the country\u2019s border with Syria.\nOn Sunday, Turkey summoned the Russian ambassador over a possible military provocation the day before."}
