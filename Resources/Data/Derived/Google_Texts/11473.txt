CENTENNIAL — A 48-year-old man charged with operating a child sex trafficking operation out of an upscale Aurora home is due in court Monday morning for an appearance on bond.

Sean Travis Crumpler faces 12 counts, including charges of child sex trafficking and child sex assault, in the case. He allegedly told one of his teen victims, according to an arrest affidavit, that he finds “young boys to bring back to the house” and that he calls his efforts “hunting.”

Crumpler is free after posting a $100,000 bond.

The Denver Post found Crumpler owns an elusive Los Angeles-area information technology firm that claims to specialize in helping primary care physicians operate their practices, according to his LinkedIn account and an employee.

His company, Centernix, is listed out of an apparent virtual office space and was registered in California in 2007. A contractor who answered Centernix’s phone last week said he was unaware of Crumpler’s arrest.

A member of FBI’s Innocence Lost Task Force in Denver, which investigated the case, said Crumpler’s arrest and his alleged crimes are ” extremely unusual.”

Two 16-year-old boys were living at Crumpler’s Aurora home along with about a dozen men between 18 and 21, according to the affidavit.

New arrivals would “earn” housing and food through “sex,” the document said.

A 21-year-old man who lived at the home told investigators that Crumpler “likes little boys.” The man also said Crumpler was HIV-positive and had unprotected sex with those living in the house.

Crumpler is a registered sex offender.
