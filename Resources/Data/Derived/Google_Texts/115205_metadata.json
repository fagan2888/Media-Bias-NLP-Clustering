Excluding certain items, largely tied to the adoption of electronic health records at its acute-care hospitals, profit rose to $1.53 a share from $1.36 a share a year earlier.\n\nNet revenue rose 9% to $2.23 billion.\n\nAnalysts had projected profit of $1.57 a share on revenue of $2.22 billion.\n\nOn a same-facility basis, acute-care hospitals reported a 7.2% increase in revenue with admissions, excluding outpatient services, up 5.1% and adjusted patient days up 5.6%. Meanwhile, revenue from its behavioral health hospitals rose 5%, with adjusted admissions increasing and adjusted patient days up 1.6%.\n\nShares closed Tuesday at $116.04, up 4% this year.\n\nWrite to Maria Armental at maria.armental@wsj.com\n\nSubscribe to WSJ: http://online.wsj.com?mod=djnwires\n\nMore from MarketWatch", "article_metadata": {"page.site": "marketwatch", "parsely-section": "MW_Industries", "author": "Maria Armental", "og": {"url": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/universal-health-services-profit-rises-sharply-2015-10-27-174853416", "type": "article", "image": "http://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png", "site_name": "MarketWatch", "title": "Universal Health Services profit rises sharply"}, "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_mark.svg", "height": 630}, "card": "summary_large_image", "site": {"id": 624413}}, "parsely-title": "Universal Health Services profit rises sharply", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-10-27T17:34:00-04:00", "ob": {"image": "http://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png"}, "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=336693422", "fb": {"app_id": 283204329838}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "parsely-author": "Maria Armental", "position": 1, "lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "parsely-type": "post", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch"}, "article.section": "Industries", "parsely-link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/universal-health-services-profit-rises-sharply-2015-10-27-174853416", "article.content_group": "marketwatch", "article.id": "C0E5FD62-6821-4285-87FC-A28DA0D51A3B"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3153\"", "article_summary": "Universal Health Services Inc. reported sharply higher third-quarter profit, bolstered by higher admission rates.\nOverall, Universal Health reported a profit of $150.3 million, or $1.48 a share, compared with $82.8 million, or 82 cents a share, a year earlier.\nMeanwhile, revenue from its behavioral health hospitals rose 5%, with adjusted admissions increasing and adjusted patient days up 1.6%.\nExcluding certain items, largely tied to the adoption of electronic health records at its acute-care hospitals, profit rose to $1.53 a share from $1.36 a share a year earlier.\nNet revenue rose 9% to $2.23 billion."}
