Rick Scott (R)\n\nA dramatic showdown over health care funding that\u2019s been unfolding in Florida over the past several weeks reveals the lengths that Republican leaders are willing to go in their quest to remain publicly opposed to Obamacare.\n\nFlorida Gov. Rick Scott (R), one of the staunchest opponents of the health care reform law, refuses to accept federal funds to implement Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act, which would extend coverage to about 800,000 low-income people in the state. At the same time, however, Scott wants the Obama administration to give him federal funds to help implement a specific Medicaid pilot program. Ultimately, Scott is demanding money from the government that doesn\u2019t appear to be linked to Obamacare \u2014 and he\u2019s willing to go to great lengths to get it.\n\nScott wants the government to give Florida about $1 billion in federal funds for a Medicaid pilot project \u2014 called the Low-Income Pool, or LIP \u2014 that helps support hospitals that serve low-income and uninsured patients. LIP is a program that was initiated under the Bush administration to address hospitals\u2019 budget shortfalls from providing too much uncompensated care to uninsured people who can\u2019t pay their bills.\n\nFederal officials are refusing, saying that Scott wouldn\u2019t need LIP funding if he simply expanded the eligibility requirements for the state\u2019s entire Medicaid program. Florida\u2019s LIP program is set to expire at the end of June, and the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) don\u2019t want to renew it. Essentially, the pilot program has become obsolete under the Affordable Care Act, and it doesn\u2019t make sense to fund LIP instead of funding Medicaid expansion.\n\nThe whole point of Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion is to cut down on hospitals\u2019 uncompensated care costs by extending insurance to low-income people who otherwise wouldn\u2019t have been able to pay for their care. Indeed, the law is succeeding in this goal so far: Hospitals across the country saved more than $7 billion last year, and the savings were the biggest in the states that agreed to expand Medicaid.\n\nBut the governor doesn\u2019t think the federal government should be able to force him to choose Medicaid expansion over LIP. Of course, the distinction is important to Scott because \u2014 like many of his fellow Republican governors \u2014 he doesn\u2019t want to give the impression that he supports any of the provisions in Obamacare.\n\nSo, this week, Scott announced that he plans to sue the federal government for allegedly coercing his state into accepting Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion bu cutting off funds for LIP. \u201cIt is appalling that President Obama would cut off federal health care dollars to Florida in an effort to force our state further into Obamacare,\u201d Scott said on Thursday to announce his impending lawsuit. He also compared federal officials to the Sopranos and said they were \u201cbullying\u201d him.\n\nThe contentious political fight is currently dividing GOP lawmakers in Florida, many of whom have urged Scott to forget about his grandstanding against Obamacare and simply accept the Medicaid expansion, which would ensure that the state has enough federal funding to cut taxes \u2014 a top GOP priority.\n\nSenate President Andy Gardiner (R) told the Tampa Bay Times that it is \u201cdifficult to understand\u201d how suing the federal government \u201cwill yield a timely resolution to the critical health care challenges facing our state.\u201d The Senate\u2019s budget chief suggested that perhaps Scott is pulling \u201ca political stunt.\u201d Meanwhile, the Koch-backed Americans for Prosperity is pressuring Florida politicians to stand firm against Obamacare.\n\nAs the Washington Post\u2019s Greg Sargent points out, one of the great ironies of this scuffle is the fact the Scott is accusing the Obama administration of undermining the safety net for low-income Floridians \u2014 while standing firm against the most important health care policy, Medicaid expansion, that could strengthen this very safety net.\n\nOn Thursday, Scott said that the Obama administration\u2019s refusal to fund the LIP program was \u201coutrageous\u201d because it \u201cthreatens poor families\u2019 access to the safety net health care services they need.\u201d But the LIP program doesn\u2019t actually extend health insurance to those families; it simply compensates hospitals for their care. In order to truly connect poor families to the health care services they need, there\u2019s an easy solution: Scott could accept the federal money to expand Medicaid, which would insure tens of thousands of the working poor.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "The dramatic showdown in Florida shows just how far Republicans are willing to go in their quest to avoid implementing health reform.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "The dramatic showdown in Florida shows just how far Republicans are willing to go in their quest to avoid implementing health reform.", "title": "Rick Scott Is Revealing The GOP\u2019s Ultimate Obamacare Hypocrisy", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2015/04/17/3648207/rick-scott-medicaid/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/AP243683673111.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The dramatic showdown in Florida shows just how far Republicans are willing to go in their quest to avoid implementing health reform.", "title": "Rick Scott Is Revealing The GOP\u2019s Ultimate Obamacare Hypocrisy", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/AP243683673111-321x214.jpg", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/AP243683673111.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/AP243683673111.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-17T10:11:16+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Health Rick Scott Is Revealing The GOP\u2019s Ultimate Obamacare Hypocrisy CREDIT: AP Photo/Mark Wallheiser Florida Gov.\nBut the governor doesn\u2019t think the federal government should be able to force him to choose Medicaid expansion over LIP.\nFederal officials are refusing, saying that Scott wouldn\u2019t need LIP funding if he simply expanded the eligibility requirements for the state\u2019s entire Medicaid program.\nAt the same time, however, Scott wants the Obama administration to give him federal funds to help implement a specific Medicaid pilot program.\nRick Scott (R)A dramatic showdown over health care funding that\u2019s been unfolding in Florida over the past several weeks reveals the lengths that Republican leaders are willing to go in their quest to remain publicly opposed to Obamacare."}
