John Kasich, Gov. Scott Walker, Jeb Bush, Medicaid, Plutocracy, Republican Party, The Right, Elections News, News, Politics News\n\nI wrote Tuesday about the way Jeb Bush is sucking the air out of the so-called moderate wing of the GOP, smothering the potential candidacy of people like Ohio Gov. John Kasich (at least for now). It\u2019s also worth looking at the way Wisconsin\u2019s Scott Walker is crowding out Kasich.\n\nJust like Kasich is an actual reformist conservative who blends traditional GOP tax and budget cutting with maverick stands like expanding Medicaid and criminal justice reform \u2013 compared with supposedly reformist Bush, whose economic program consists of warmed over supply side policies \u2013 Kasich is what Scott Walker pretends to be: A practical Midwestern governor of a hugely important swing state with a track record of governing.\n\nKasich\u2019s state is also rebounding well from the recession, while Walker\u2019s is last in Midwestern job creation and first in the nation in middle-class wage decline. So why is Walker still considered Bush\u2019s top primary challenger, especially for the donor class, while Kasich can\u2019t get started?\n\nThere\u2019s an important glimpse of an answer in this dispatch from a Kasich meeting with big New York donors. This is the group, by the way, that hosted Walker in February, though the gathering was hijacked by Rudy Giuliani insisting President Obama doesn\u2019t love America. Luckily for Kasich \u2013 or maybe not \u2013 Giuliani didn\u2019t upstage him.\n\nBut Kasich left the crowd unwowed anyway, says the National Review\u2019s Eliana Johnson, who also wrote an influential piece about growing GOP worries about Walker this week. Johnson is well-sourced when it comes to monied Republicans\u2019 concerns about Walker\u2019s stumbles, so it\u2019s interesting to see her explain why this group isn\u2019t excited about Kasich.\n\nApparently Kasich turned them off with his \u201cprickly\u201d answer to a question from conservative intellectual powerhouse Avik Roy, about whether he wants to repeal Obamacare yet maintain its expansion of Medicaid. When pushed, Kasich defended Medicaid recipients: \u201cMaybe you think we should put them in prison. I don\u2019t. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a conservative position. Because the reality is, if you don\u2019t treat the drug addicted and the mentally ill and the working poor, you\u2019re gonna have them and they\u2019re gonna be a big cost to society.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Wisconsin governor smashed unions and shredded the safety net, so his many stumbles have been forgiven \u2013 so far", "title": "The rich\u2019s Scott Walker bungle: Why plutocrats fell for the wrong GOP governor", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The Wisconsin governor smashed unions and shredded the safety net, so his many stumbles have been forgiven \u2013 so far", "title": "The rich\u2019s Scott Walker bungle: Why plutocrats fell for the wrong GOP governor", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/03/27/the_richs_scott_walker_bungle_why_plutocrats_fell_for_the_wrong_gop_governor/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/kasich_walker.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Wisconsin governor smashed unions and shredded the safety net, so his many stumbles have been forgiven \u2013 so far", "title": "The rich\u2019s Scott Walker bungle: Why plutocrats fell for the wrong GOP governor", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/kasich_walker.jpg", "creator": "@joanwalsh", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Joan Walsh", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2016 Elections, avik roy, GOP, Gov.
