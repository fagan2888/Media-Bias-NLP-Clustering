Jay Carney often made noise at the White House, and now it’s his son’s turn.

The former press secretary’s son Hugo, 12, brought his boy rock band, Twenty20, to the South Lawn of the White House on Monday for a concert as President Obama hosted administration staffers at a party. The grounds are also being readied for annual congressional picnic Wednesday.

Mr. Carney, who left the White House three months ago, took a job last week as a contributor on CNN.

The boy band includes Ben Froman, son of U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman; Lucas Donovan, son of White House Budget Director Shaun Donovan; and Joey Doyle, son of Patti Solis Doyle, former campaign manager for Hillary Rodham Clinton.

All four boys are schoolmates of Sasha and Malia Obama at Sidwell Friends School in Washington.
