Combs had tried to arrest Bailey for \u201cobstruction of justice\u201d after the man came to argue about a ticket for a broken tail light his daughter received. The cop followed Bailey to his truck and tried to prevent him from getting away. He says he got his arm stuck in the truck\u2019s steering wheel and feared for his life if Bailey drove way when he shot him fatally twice in the chest.\n\nIn 2013, the Department of Justice (DOJ) decided there were no civil rights violations. State investigators followed into Eutawville and decided Combs was the aggressor and shouldn\u2019t have escalated the situation. Last August he was charged with official misconduct. State prosecutors wanted to charge him with murder but had to wait until a judge dismissed a stand your ground claim, which was dismissed last week. The trial for official misconduct, which comes with up to a 10 year sentence, was supposed to start next week. But prosecutors secured an indictment on the murder charge. They wanted to start the murder trial next week but the judge has postponed it to January given the new charges.\n\nPredictably, Combs lawyer blames the new (but long anticipated) murder charge on racial motivations. \"He's trying to make it racial,\" Combs' lawyer said of the prosecutor in the case. \"He's got all the national issues going on.\"\n\nCombs is white and Bailey was black. The Obama administration was in charge when the DOJ decided there wasn\u2019t enough evidence for a civil rights violation, and the South Carolina state government is Republican. As this case appears to move closer to a fair resolution in the justice system, it\u2019s an important reminder that things aren\u2019t always so, uh, black and white.\n\nReason's annual Webathon is underway!
