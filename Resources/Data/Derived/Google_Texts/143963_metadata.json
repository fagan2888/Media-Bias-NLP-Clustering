They may have been happier when it moved slowly, dwelling in the 19th century \u2014 and didn\u2019t operate under the burden of being a ratings force and fundraising asset for PBS.\n\nBut while last season pushed the Crawley clan toward the Jazz Age, the extended grieving, especially on the part of widowed Lady Mary, begged for a fresh start. This week, creator Julian Fellowes obliges.\n\nWhen \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d returns for season 5 on Jan. 4 (at 9 p.m. on RMPBS), the year is 1924 and change is everywhere. Here come the Roaring Twenties.\n\nMary has committed to living in the present, rather than continuing to mourn the tragedy in her past. The customs of well-bred courtship seem to be undergoing revision. Mary wonders aloud to Anna (Joanne Froggatt) why courting couples don\u2019t test out the physical side of things before marriage. Suitor Tony Gillingham (Tom Cullen) will soon suggest a weekend away \u2014 with adjoining rooms.\n\nDaisy is tired of seeing the world pass her by and intends to educate herself in case she really does have to run a farm someday. Lady Rose is pushing to get a wireless (radio), but for now, Lord Grantham is holding the line.\n\nSeveral of the \u201cold duffers\u201d \u2014 notably Molesley \u2014 are worried about aging.\n\nNot only is the government now led by a Labor Party prime minister, a shock to the old way of life at the grand manors, but the threat of more intermingling between the upper crust and lower classes can only be a worry to Lord Grantham and his set.\n\n\u201cThe nature of life is not permanence but flux,\u201d Mr. Carson (Jim Carter) wisely observes.\n\n\u201cThings are changing whether we are sad about it or not,\u201d observes Mrs. Hughes (Phyllis Logan).\n\nMaybe the pace of the drama is more rapid to signify the hurried pace of the more modern world. Or maybe the production is running in fear of losing its momentum. It appears to calm down after the first hour.\n\nWhile change is the only constant, some things remain the same: Downstairs, Barrow is still a bully, while Bates is still hiding a secret; upstairs, Branson remains torn between his humble beginnings and his current elevated status, while Lady Edith (Laura Carmichael) is tormented by the fact that she abandoned her baby to the couple living on the Grantham property.\n\nLuckily, Lady Violet (Maggie Smith) still manages to get the last, best word:\n\n\u201cPrinciples are like prayers, noble of course, but awkward at a party.\u201d\n\nThis season\u2019s guest stars include Richard E. Grant, Anna Chancellor (a riot as randy Lady Anstruther), Rade Sherbedgia, Harriet Walter and Peter Egan.\n\nEven when it\u2019s slow, \u201cDownton\u201d reunites us with favorite characters in a distant time of manners and dressing for dinner. The prettiest soap opera on TV continues to offer a refuge from the present while mirroring contemporary attitudes and evolutions. Really, it\u2019s all about change.\n\nJoanne Ostrow: 303-954-1830, jostrow@denverpost.com or twitter.com/ostrowdp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "PBS \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d returns for season 5 \u2014 a time of change", "title": "PBS \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d returns for season 5 \u2014 a time of change", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/12/24/pbs-downton-abbey-returns-for-season-5-a-time-of-change/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141224__20141228_E1_AE28TVOSTROWp1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141224__20141228_E1_AE28TVOSTROWp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-24T15:37:56+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T10:45:07+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd97cd\"", "article_summary": "When \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d returns for season 5 on Jan. 4 (at 9 p.m. on RMPBS), the year is 1924 and change is everywhere.\nThey may believe life was better when \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d first caught the world\u2019s attention.\nLike the old sticks-in-the-mud of Downton, some viewers may wish things hadn\u2019t changed.\nEven when it\u2019s slow, \u201cDownton\u201d reunites us with favorite characters in a distant time of manners and dressing for dinner.\nThe prettiest soap opera on TV continues to offer a refuge from the present while mirroring contemporary attitudes and evolutions."}
