Jessie Sulka, a student at the High School@Moorpark College, is the poetry champion of Ventura County, having won Wednesday’s Poetry Out Loud competition at the High Street Theatre in Moorpark. Sulka will represent Ventura County in next month’s state finals in Sacramento.

Poetry Out Loud is a national recitation contest for high school students, supported by the National Education Association and the Poetry Foundation, in collaboration with state art agencies. The goals of the contest, during which students memorize and perform two poems, are to help students master public speaking skills, build self-confidence and learn about their literary heritage, organizer Marsha de la O said.

Jack Evans, from Villanova Preparatory School in Ojai, is the alternate champion and will perform in Sacramento if Sulka is unable to be there.
