Blaine Luetkemeyer, R-Mo., today reintroduced legislation to end the Justice Department initiative known as Operation Choke Point.\n\n\u201cWhile steps have been made in the case against Operation Choke Point, there is still a need for my legislation to be reintroduced this Congress,\u201d he said in a press release.\n\nThe legislation, which Luetkemeyer previously introduced last November, comes one week after the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) walked back its involvement in the program and reversed its policies in targeting legal and legitimate industries that are disfavored by the Obama administration.\n\n>>> FDIC Changes Tactics in Response to Operation Choke Point\n\nEven though some view the agency\u2019s backpedaling as a victory against Operation Choke Point, Brian Wise at U.S. Consumer Coalition says the policy changes are nothing more than a political stunt to \u201cquell the public scrutiny of this program.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile steps have been made in the case against Operation Choke Point, there is still a need for my legislation to be reintroduced this Congress.\u201d -@RepBlainePress\n\nLuetkemeyer echoed those concerns, adding:\n\n\u201cWhile I am pleased the FDIC is implementing parts of my legislation, it is not enough. I am reintroducing the Financial Institution Customer Protection Act because this legislation needs to be codified into law so that other agencies don\u2019t ever fall into this illegal and abusive practice.\u201d\n\n>>> Small Business Owner Questions Why Justice Department Would Threaten His Livelihood\n\nIn 2012, the Justice Department set out on an ambitious mission to \u201creduce dramatically mass market consumer fraud\u201d by limiting fraudsters\u2019 ability to access bank accounts and other financial services. Whether intentional or not, the initiative resulted in the termination of bank accounts in a range of legal and legitimate industries.\n\nThe program operates by using government agencies such as the FDIC and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to threaten banks and third parties with regulatory consequences if they do not comply with banking regulators.\n\nLuetkemeyer\u2019s bill, which has bipartisan support, would prohibit a federal banking agency from \u201csuggesting, requesting or ordering a depository institution to terminate a specific customer account, or otherwise restrict or discourage it from entering into or maintaining a banking relationship with a specific customer, unless the agency has a material reason to do so, and the reason is not based solely on reputation risk.\u201d\n\nThe Missouri congressman, who\u2019s also a former banker, hopes that now that the FDIC has made its involvement with Operation Choke Point \u201cclear,\u201d members on both sides of the aisle will see the importance of passing legislation.\n\n>>> Read More: Congressman Seeks to End Program He Calls \u2018More Dangerous\u2019 Than IRS Scandal", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u201cWhile steps have been made in the case against Operation Choke Point, there is still a need for my legislation to be reintroduced this Congress.\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\u201cWhile steps have been made in the case against Operation Choke Point, there is still a need for my legislation to be reintroduced this Congress.\u201d", "title": "Congressman Reintroduces Bill to End Operation Choke Point", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/rollcallpix042701.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-03-21T22:24:14+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1CySC3Q"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\u201cWhile steps have been made in the case against Operation Choke Point, there is still a need for my legislation to be reintroduced this Congress.\u201d", "title": "Congressman Reintroduces Bill to End Operation Choke Point", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/rollcallpix042701.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Law", "tag": "executive overreach", "published_time": "2015-02-05T18:12:48+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-21T22:24:14+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "choke point, operation choke point, justice department, doj, firearms, payment processors, FDIC"}, "article_summary": "Rep.
