More than 20 percent chose platinum and 10 percent gold.\n\nThe demographics and relatively rich benefit choices of those members so far may leave Humana a bit more exposed than others, although the ACA's risk adjustment, reinsurance and risk corridor programs could be helpful with offsetting that as well. Plus, exchanges are \"just 3 percent of our total revenue,\" as Steven McCulley, Humana's interim CFO, noted.\n\nIn Medicare Advantage, \"sustainable funding\" is still an ongoing concern, Broussard said, adding that the company is anticipating an announcement by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services in late February of rates being reduced by another 6.5 percent.\n\nIf that's the reduction and depending on other factors, Broussard said Humana may have to \"follow competitors' adverse actions\" of \"cutting benefits, exiting markets and changing networks.\"\n\nThe company is still predicting enrollment growth, though, expecting to add at least another 370,000 seniors to the ranks of its 2.3 million Medicare Advantage membership, along with another 450,000 in stand alone Medicare drug plans.\n\nBroussard also thinks Humana's clinical programs \"position us well to deal with the growth dealing with in 2014. Humana's SeniorBridge company is hiring more nurse practitioners for both over-the-phone care management and home care, he said.\n\nAnd in addition to Metropolitan Health Networks, bought in 2012 for $500 million, Humana is planning to rely on another recent acquisition for integrated care, Florida-based long-term care and nursing home diversion company American Eldercare.\n\nBroussard said they're particularly looking to deploy American Eldercare to coordinate care for Medicaid-Medicare dual eligibles, a relatively new business for Humana, with three large contracts starting this year.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/humana-takes-q4-hit-remains-positive-about-2014-outlook", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/modules/open_graph/hfn-stacked.jpeg", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Humana reported a fourth-quarter loss, but, remaining positive about 2014, reaffirmed its financial outlook for the upcoming year.", "title": "Humana takes Q4 hit, but remains positive about 2014 outlook"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HC_Finance", "image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/modules/open_graph/hfn-stacked.jpeg"}, "description": "Humana reported a fourth-quarter loss, but, remaining positive about 2014, reaffirmed its financial outlook for the upcoming year.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Humana takes Q4 hit, but remains positive about 2014 outlook"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Humana reported a fourth-quarter loss, but, remaining positive about 2014, reaffirmed its financial outlook for the upcoming year.&#13; The fourth quarter of last year brought a $30 million loss stemming from a need to shore up cash reserves for long-term care, the company detailed in its latest financial report, released Wednesday.&#13; [See also: Humana's Q1 earnings leap]", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9425\"", "article_summary": "Humana reported a fourth-quarter loss, but, remaining positive about 2014, reaffirmed its financial outlook for the upcoming year.\nHumana's SeniorBridge company is hiring more nurse practitioners for both over-the-phone care management and home care, he said.\nIf that's the reduction and depending on other factors, Broussard said Humana may have to \"follow competitors' adverse actions\" of \"cutting benefits, exiting markets and changing networks.\"\nBroussard also thinks Humana's clinical programs \"position us well to deal with the growth dealing with in 2014.\nBroussard said they're particularly looking to deploy American Eldercare to coordinate care for Medicaid-Medicare dual eligibles, a relatively new business for Humana, with three large contracts starting this year."}
