Live Nation, the theater\u2019s owner, should charge a fee to pay for medical bills.\n\nTHIS weekend\u2019s three-day Sasquatch! music festival at the Gorge Amphitheatre near Quincy is expected to be another boisterous party for 25,000 concertgoers \u2014 and another huge headache for the tiny hospital 17 miles away.\n\nWhen music, crowds, alcohol and drugs mix at the venue, the result can be as much as a nearly sixfold spike in the number of drunk, unconscious and beat-up patients in the emergency room at Quincy Valley Medical Center. During last June\u2019s Paradiso electronic music festival, a 21-year-old died from a methamphetamine overdose.\n\nHospital officials, in part, blame the Gorge and its operator, Live Nation, for nearly $400,000 in unpaid medical bills and extra staff time in 2013.\n\nLive Nation so far has refused to help defray that cost, according to news reports. Officials with the concert giant say they are not responsible for the behavior of customers. A Live Nation spokeswoman says the company already contributes $1.2 million in admission taxes to Grant County each year, along with improvements to parking, water lines and on-site medical services.\n\nThat's nice, but a good neighbor must do more. Local taxpayers should not have to clean up the mess left behind by concert attendees, including thousands from the Seattle area.\n\nState Rep. Matt Manweller, R-Ellensburg, is crafting a bill that would add a $1 surcharge per ticket for shows at the Gorge. The proceeds would be split between the Quincy hospital and the local fire department.\n\nIt\u2019s a good idea. Live Nation should support Manweller\u2019s plan. If Sasquatch! attendees could afford a ticket that costs more than $300 a pop, they should be able to cough up an extra buck to offset the price of partying a little too hard.\n\nMany of the concertgoers-turned-patients are most likely among the so-called \u201cyoung invincibles\u201d \u2014 the 18- to 34-year-olds who most often lack health insurance \u2014 President Obama has urged them to buy coverage through Affordable Care Act exchanges.\n\nThe plight of the Quincy hospital is a reminder for those who didn\u2019t sign up this year: your choice carries a significant cost.\n\nEditorial board members are editorial page editor Kate Riley, Frank A.
