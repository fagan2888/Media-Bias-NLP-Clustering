It was a familiar finish for Marquette high jumper Wally Ellenson on Saturday.

The junior, who also was a redshirt member of the men's basketball team this year, ended up third at the prestigious Drake Relays in Des Moines, Iowa.

Ellenson cleared 7 feet 1Â¾ inches but had three misses at 7-31/4.

Ellenson finished behind Texas Tech's Jacorian Duffield and Bradley Adkins. Interestingly, Duffield and Adkins also finished above Ellenson at the NCAA indoor track and field championships in March.

Duffield soared over 7-41/2, the best winning jump in the event at the relays since 1988.

The UW-Milwaukee women's sprint medley relay team of Anuli Okonkwo, Michelle Garner, Kate Novacek and Dana Clausen crossed the line in 4:02.27 to set a new school record. That mark was good for 19th place. MU's sprint medley relay team was 16th in 4:01.08.
