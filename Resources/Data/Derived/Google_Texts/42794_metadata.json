David Vitter is the frontrunner to be Louisiana\u2019s next governor. To some people, that\u2019s surprising. The state\u2019s senior senator, who has survived a sex scandal, is not known for his charisma and can be a polarizing figure.\n\nBut perhaps it\u2019s not surprising at all. He has been running since January 2014, and over the past several years he has forged strong ties with officeholders statewide through his efforts to build a Louisiana Republican majority. He also is one of President Barack Obama\u2019s harshest critics, although there\u2019s plenty of competition for that description in the Bayou State.\n\nLike the current governor, Vitter is a Rhodes scholar; the Metairie resident graduated from Harvard, Oxford and Tulane Law. He served in the Louisiana House of Representatives from 1992 to 1999 before being elected to Congress. He won his current U.S. Senate seat in 2004 and was easily re-elected in 2010.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a huge consensus in the state that people want leadership,\u201d Vitter says. \u201cThey want us to face our big challenges head on. They\u2019re tired of kicking the can down the road, avoiding the big issues, or playing politics with them.\u201d\n\nYou have called Gov. Jindal\u2019s plan to scale back the state\u2019s inventory tax credit a \u201chuge tax increase on thousands of employers.\u201d You\u2019ve proposed eliminating the inventory tax entirely while offering local governments alternative revenue from the state. Why is that a better system?\n\nNo. 1, it\u2019s still a burden for businesses to pay it and get reimbursed, and there\u2019s some uncertainty with the state always being able to pay it. Secondly, you have the locals valuing the property. But the state, which has to pay the bill, is not involved in the assessment at all, and that bill has been going up and up. So we need to control that so it\u2019s not an ever-increasing cost for the state taxpayer. We could do that in two ways: a straight payment to the locals at a set rate, or potentially create some revenue opportunity that doesn\u2019t exist now. That\u2019s going to depend on a lot of other moving parts with spending and tax reform, so it will have to be part of a broader package. We need to broaden the base on the tax side by doing away with certain credits, exemptions and deductions.\n\nYou\u2019ve called for a robust cost-benefit analysis of our credits and exemptions. What would that process look like, and what\u2019s your standard for an acceptable program?\n\nThe standard would be understanding from experts the cost to the state taxpayer in foregone revenue compared to the benefit in terms of economic development and revenue associated with that. I don\u2019t think the process has to be super-formalized, but we need to go through that analysis from experts.\n\nDoes the benefit have to exceed the cost?\n\nI think we need to understand the numbers, but there are other benefits besides just revenue. I don\u2019t think we can have an ironclad rule that the benefit exceeds the foregone revenue, but we certainly need to understand the numbers.\n\nIf the goal is to broaden the base and lower the rates, should that process be revenue neutral, as some conservatives would argue?\n\nNo. I would expect it to bring new revenue to address our budget crisis.\n\nOn your campaign website, you list several state consulting contracts that you believe are inappropriate. What do you see as the proper role for consultants working for state government?\n\nWe need to look at it on a case-by-case basis. It can be a good thing if you reduce the cost of state government, but very often what\u2019s been going on is that you create these consulting contracts and state government isn\u2019t cut, it\u2019s just less work [for government]. That is not a good thing.\n\nYou want to free up some of the state\u2019s dedicated spending, but you\u2019re not talking about a constitutional convention. How would you attack the problem?\n\nI\u2019ve called for a focused and immediate legislative session. There are at least three reasons that is preferable to a constitutional convention. No. 1, we have to do things that are both statutory and constitutional, and you can do both in a session. No. 2, to do a constitutional convention right would take a lot of planning and groundwork, and we don\u2019t have the time. And No. 3, there\u2019s some possibility that a constitutional convention could be out of control and go into all sorts of things outside of this immediate problem.\n\nAnd at the end of this session, there would be some proposed constitutional amendments that would have to go before the public.\n\nCorrect. Several things I\u2019m talking about, including lifting certain budget protections, would take constitutional amendments.\n\nConversely, you\u2019ve called for greater protection to the Transportation Trust Fund.\n\nThat\u2019s the one exception to the broader rule that I would make. I think we need to rebuild citizens\u2019 confidence in that fund. It\u2019s been used as a piggy bank too often for unrelated things. We don\u2019t put enough related revenue into it, such as the vehicle sales tax, where it never gets to the Transportation Trust Fund.\n\nWould you change how the state handles its public/private charity hospitals?\n\nI think you have to start with the expectation that they\u2019re all works in progress, so we\u2019re going to need to fine-tune and improve the partnerships. I was just at the medical school in Shreveport and expressed strong support for the medical center. I think we need a stronger partnership there, including one or more private partners with the ability to make capital investments. We need to go market by market and really fine-tune these partnerships.\n\nYou say you want to fix a \u201cbroken\u201d Medicaid system. The state recently went to managed care for Medicaid recipients. What would you change?\n\nI would not rule out, as Gov. Jindal has, the possibility of some type of waiver under the Medicaid expansion [proposed by the federal government under the Affordable Care Act], although I would have to understand how we\u2019re going to pay the new state dollars for any expansion. And I would want a reformed system, not traditional Medicaid, so some sort of [private] coverage system. And I would not want to increase any disincentives to work. Within our present Medicaid system, I think there are improvements we can make. I\u2019m not against a managed care model in general. I think that can be an improvement over traditional Medicaid. Particularly if we consider any expansion, we need to look at new models focused more on the market and private coverage and helping people get that coverage.\n\nIn the long term, does it make more sense to expand Medicaid and let the dollars follow the patient as a replacement for the public hospital system?\n\nI\u2019ve always favored that concept. But we have traditionally had these institutions to serve low-income people, and the new partnerships still have that mission.\n\nSo for now, the public/private partnerships are the path we\u2019ll stay on?\n\nI think that\u2019s where we are for the foreseeable future, and I think it\u2019s important to remind those providers that they have that mission.\n\nIs it the state\u2019s responsibility to try to make whole, for example, Baton Rouge General\u2013Mid City, which says it has been harmed by the partnerships?\n\nI just had a very good meeting there. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s the state\u2019s responsibility to cover any losses they point to, but we need to be sensitive to that because they cover an important part of the city. Certainly, their closing their emergency room is significant, and we need to react to that, at a minimum, with making sure we have transportation to move true emergency room cases to Our Lady of the Lake.\n\nShould public colleges and universities be able to charge whatever the market will bear?\n\nNo. I think public higher education has a specific mission that involves affordability. Having said that, I do favor a lot more autonomy and flexibility for those governing higher ed, versus our present system which is political and has so many strings attached that it even requires a two-thirds vote by legislators for fee increases.\n\nShould TOPS be capped or limited in any way?\n\nI think we need to look at that in order to preserve TOPS. We can\u2019t sustain that without limits, so I think we need to look at reform. I\u2019m not ready to endorse any specific changes yet, but I\u2019m talking to a lot of experts about that.\n\nHow would you change our ethics rules and enforcement of those rules?\n\nI think it\u2019s mainly about having an administration that has a zero-tolerance policy for corruption. But there certainly may be some areas where we need to change the law. Two examples: There have been a lot of valid criticisms about abusing the public records law\u2019s deliberative process exemption for formulating policy, and I think we need to limit that and redefine that under state law. Secondly, I think the ethics administration probably needs more audit capacity, so that they catch more problems that have been in the news like double-dipping when certain people pay for some things from both official per diems and campaign accounts.\n\nWhat\u2019s your objection to the current administration\u2019s ethics record?\n\nWell, I\u2019ll talk about what I will do, which is to have an executive order to stop abuse of the deliberative process exemption. It needs to be limited to real policymaking, not five levels down in the bowels of every state agency, where in some cases folks just put in an email, \u201cBy the way, this is deliberative.\u201d PAR has done a lot of work in this regard, and I would look at some of the parameters they have suggested.\n\nDoes Louisiana need a \u201creligious freedom\u201d law similar to what Indiana has enacted?\n\nI can tell you as governor I would ensure that state government takes no action to discriminate against any individuals based on the individual\u2019s views on marriage, whatever they are, whether they are pro-gay marriage or like me believe that marriage is between one man and one woman.\n\nBut is there really a religious freedom problem in Louisiana that needs to be addressed by legislation?\n\nI think we have a healthy respect for those freedoms in Louisiana. I can certainly tell [you that] under my administration that would be strongly protected.\n\nWhat is your assessment of Gov. Jindal\u2019s effectiveness? What grade would you give him?\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s my place to grade him. It\u2019s my place to work hard and be graded, and I\u2019m working very hard to be graded on my ideas and proposals.\n\nRelated stories:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Baton Rouge Business Report", "description": "(Photography by Marie Constantin) The candidate at the front of the pack talks taxes, TOPS and transportation.
