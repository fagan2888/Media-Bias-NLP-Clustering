More than a third of American adults are obese, according to a report by Trust for America\u2019s Health.\n\nObesity is more than just a health problem. It\u2019s also an economic issue, and obesity is one of the biggest drivers of health-care spending in the country. One study found that the lifetime health-care costs for an obese person are on average $92,235 more than the costs for a person of normal weight.\n\nSLIDESHOW: The 10 States with the highest obesity rates.\n\nMore than 9 percent of the country\u2019s population, or 29 million Americans, have diabetes.\n\nA 2014 analysis prepared for The Fiscal Times by Scott Kahan, director of the National Center for Weight & Wellness at George Washington University, put the total cost of obesity \u2014 including medical services, decreased productivity and disability payments \u2014 at more than $300 billion a year.\n\nThose costs are likely to rise as the country ages, since obese people have higher rates of disability and illnesses as they get older. In addition to heart disease and stroke, obesity has been linked to higher rates of dementia and some cancers.\n\nThe extent of the problem varies greatly by state. Obesity rates exceed 35 percent in Arkansas, West Virginia and Mississippi, and are above 30 percent in 22 states. Colorado has the country\u2019s lowest obesity rate (21.3 percent), followed by the District of Columbia (21.7 percent) and Hawaii (22.1 percent).\n\nClick here to see the 10 States with the highest obesity rates.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The obesity rate across the United States is stabilizing, but remains high.", "title": "The Fattest (and Leanest) States in America", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/02/Fattest-and-Leanest-States-America", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/slideshows/07182012_flight_obese_slideshow.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/02/Fattest-and-Leanest-States-America", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/slideshows/07182012_flight_obese_slideshow.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@bethbrav"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "The obesity rate across the United States is stabilizing, but remains high.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Click here to see the 10 States with the highest obesity rates.\nColorado has the country\u2019s lowest obesity rate (21.3 percent), followed by the District of Columbia (21.7 percent) and Hawaii (22.1 percent).\nSLIDESHOW: The 10 States with the highest obesity rates.\nObesity rates exceed 35 percent in Arkansas, West Virginia and Mississippi, and are above 30 percent in 22 states.\nThe obesity rate across the United States is stabilizing, but remains high."}
