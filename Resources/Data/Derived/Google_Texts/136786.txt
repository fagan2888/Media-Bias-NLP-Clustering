The federal government is deeply involved in promoting GMO crops and foods. Farm subsidies send billions of dollars to farmers who plant—overwhelmingly—GMO crops. The USDA National School Lunch Program and other USDA commodity programs then buy up those GMO crops and animals that were fed those GMO crops.

In Congress, the Safe & Accurate Food Labeling Act (the so-called "Dark Act") has threatened to create a vast new USDA bureaucracy that would undermine important and successful private labeling certification bodies like the Non-GMO Project, while the Farmer Assurance Provision (the so-called "Monsanto Protection Act") provided GMO farmers with insidious (and unconstitutional) protections.

While the federal government sides with GMO, states, counties, and cities around the country have largely taken the opposite tack. Baylen Linnekin argues that the right policy for the government is to just stay out of the fray entirely.
