There are really so many tears in this Christmas along with tears of Baby Jesus!\u201d\n\nThe Pope appealed to Jesus to \u201csave the many children who are victims of violence, made the object of illicit trade and trafficking in persons, or forced to become soldiers.\u201d He specifically prayed that Jesus might \u201ccomfort the families of children killed in Pakistan last week,\u201d and that he might be \u201cclose to all who suffer from diseases, in particular to the victims of the epidemic of Ebola.\u201d\n\nThe Pope ended his address asking that \u201cthe power of Christ\u201d be felt in the \u201cmany hearts who suffer wars, persecution and slavery,\u201d so that, one day, \u201cwe can say with joy: \u2018Our eyes have seen your salvation.\u2019\u201d\n\nFollow Thomas D.
