Yes, we have been using the Treasury. Yes, we have been using resources from donors, but we must have a sustainable way of raising money to finance the health sector.\n\n\u201cThis is the reason this Government has decided to innovate and come up with the National Social Health Insurance Scheme where all civil servants, all workers will be contributing a minimum amount of money every month,\u201d he said.\n\nDr Chilufya said through the monthly contributions, patients under the scheme would be able to access health services at any health institution.\n\nDr Chilufya said the scheme was a very important step in ensuring universal access to health services.\n\nHe said out-of-pocket payment at the point of service delivery should be discouraged, hence the need for a scheme which would enable those needing treatment to just produce an insurance card and be attended to.\n\n\u201cIf you want all Zambians to have health services without facing financial hardship(s), we need to address the aspect of financial capacity. People must access health services without facing financial hardship(s).\n\n\u201cSo this is the Government that shall for the very first time enact a National Social Health Insurance Scheme. In America, you have been hearing of the Obamacare, here, this is the Government that shall begin what you may want to call the Edgarcare,\u201d he said.\n\nDr Chilufya also said that the ministries of Health and Justice were currently refining the National Social Health Insurance Bill before it could be presented to Cabinet and tabled in Parliament.\n\nHe said the scheme\u2019s designs had been made, human resource identified and the general framework was in place.\n\nMeanwhile, Dr Chilufya said the Government had managed to win back donor support in the health sector owing to prudent utilisation of resources as a result of strengthened systems.", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "generator": "WordPress 3.5.1"}, "article_summary": "The Edgarcare, whose other name is the National Social Health Insurance Scheme, is in honour of President Edgar Lungu.\n\u201cSo this is the Government that shall for the very first time enact a National Social Health Insurance Scheme.\n\u201cIf you want all Zambians to have health services without facing financial hardship(s), we need to address the aspect of financial capacity.\nPeople must access health services without facing financial hardship(s).\nDr Chilufya said through the monthly contributions, patients under the scheme would be able to access health services at any health institution."}
