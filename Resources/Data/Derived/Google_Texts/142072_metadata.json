Ted Cruz , R-Texas, and Mike Lee, R- Utah, introduced legislation Thursday to accelerate how fast the Food and Drug Administration OKs drugs and devices.\n\nBefore a drug can reach the U.S. market, it undergoes extensive scrutiny from the agency to win the federal government\u2019s stamp of approval.\n\nWhile the process is intended to protect consumers from dangerous, even deadly, side effects, the FDA often is criticized for excessive delays that prevent Americans from receiving potentially lifesaving treatments.\n\n\u201cWe need to tear down the barriers blocking a new era of medical innovation, and the primary inhibitor is the government itself,\u201d Cruz said in a prepared statement, adding:\n\nOur legislation will unleash lifesaving drugs and devices in the United States, help mitigate critical drug shortages in the U.S., and put downward pressure on the prices of medical devices and drugs as well.\n\nThe Cruz-Lee legislation would require the FDA to expedite review of any drug, device, or biological application already approved and sold in \u201cdeveloped and trustworthy\u201d nations.\n\nReciprocal approval, the senators said, would give those who are suffering from chronic or life-threatening conditions fast-tracked access to drugs and medical devices demonstrated to be safe in specific countries.\n\nIn the United States, it takes on average more than a decade for a new drug to reach store shelves, and, according to a Forbes analysis, that process costs companies roughly $350 million.\n\nCruz said allowing treatments already used in trusted nations would spark a \u201csupply-side medical revolution\u201d that could drive down costs.\n\nThe bill would give the FDA 30 days to accept or reject a sponsor\u2019s application to bring \u201cqualified medical products\u201d\u2014those already approved and sold in developed nations\u2014into the U.S. Those nations would include Israel, Australia, Canada, Japan, and members of the European Union.\n\nThe legislation, dubbed the Reciprocity Ensures Streamlined Use of Lifesaving Treatments Act, includes a congressional backstop if the FDA rejects an application. It would allow Congress to override an FDA-denied application with a joint resolution, which requires a majority vote and the president\u2019s signature.\n\nAlthough the FDA needs much broader reform, Lee said, the bill would bring \u201clifesaving treatments\u201d to \u201csome of the most vulnerable.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "On average, it takes a new drug over a decade to reach store shelves.
