Robert Bartlett and his wife to settle on a name for their newborn son two months ago.\n\n\u201cI named my son after my buddy who was killed next to me [in Iraq],\u201d Bartlett says, referring to the fateful day in May of 2005 when he says an Iranian roadside bomb tore into their Humvee. \u201cStaff Sgt. William Brooks. That was his name. And William, in Irish, is Liam.\u201d\n\nThe explosion that claimed Brooks\u2019 life also cost Bartlett dearly. The then 30-year-old\u2019s face was torn in half from the left corner of his temple down through his jaw; he was declared deceased three times by medical personnel over the course of his treatment as a result of internal bleeding from ball bearings that had penetrated his chest and body.\n\nThe Humvee\u2019s \u201cgunner,\u201d the lookout atop the vehicle, lost his legs in the explosion.\n\nTen years later, Bartlett is recovered, retired, and a proud new father, personally poised for a joyous phase of life. But publicly, he has spent much of his recent time in another type of battle, a political one fought not on desert roads, but in congressional hallways.\n\nBartlett this summer joined the Veterans Against the Deal movement\u2014coalition of veterans who believe that the Iran deal would be a grave misstep for the United States\u2014to, as he explains, protect the United States and the safety of American citizens.\n\n\u201cI took an oath to support the United States and to protect them, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m still doing to this day,\u201d he says, asking, \u201cHow is giving $150 billion to the very men who killed Americans and have American blood on their hands going to stop any of it?\u201d\n\nIt would be hard to argue that Bartlett is not able to offer a unique perspective on both Iranian weaponry and American liberty.\n\n\u201cWhen the director [of Veterans Against the Deal], Michael Pregent, reached out to me, he knew I\u2019d been hit by an Iranian bomb,\u201d Bartlett says. \u201cOur focus is to inspire Americans that we gave them a voice, and we gave them the freedom to say something and speak up. We can\u2019t, as Americans, be quiet when tyranny is at our door.\u201d\n\nBartlett has appeared on television opposing the Iran deal. He believes that the deal\u2019s supporters \u201cneed their heads examined.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey could walk away from the deal once they get the money,\u201d Bartlett says. \u201cThat\u2019s how scary it is, and that\u2019s the option they have. We have got to keep that in mind.\u201d\n\nBartlett spent an afternoon last month with retired Navy SEAL and former explosive ordnance (EOD) technician Ken Stethem, a fellow Veterans Against the Deal member whose brother was killed by Hezbollah terrorists in a 1985 plane hijacking. The two banged on the doors of senators and congressmen in a last-ditch effort to sway the deal\u2019s course.\n\nIn September, after Democrats succeeded in blocking a Republican resolution against the deal, President Obama called the agreement a \u201cvictory for diplomacy.\u201d\n\nIn Bartlett\u2019s view, the Iranians are already breaking the deal\u2019s terms.\n\n\u201c[Maj. Gen. Qassim] Suleimani\u2019s traveling,\u201d he says. \u201cHe\u2019s secured S-300 [missiles]. That\u2019s breaking the deal right there. He\u2019s not supposed to be doing any of that.\u201d\n\nDespite last month\u2019s resolution rejection, Bartlett says the Veterans Against the Deal will not stop fighting to be heard.\n\n\u201cWhat hit me in the head killed my buddy, and I have to be a voice for him,\u201d Bartlett says. \u201cMy buddy doesn\u2019t get to walk his girls down the aisle, so I have to stand up.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "He wants to know why we're helping a country with American blood on its hands.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "He wants to know why we're helping a country with American blood on its hands.", "title": "Why This Wounded Iraq Veteran Opposed the Iran Deal", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Bartlett.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-10-06T00:45:41+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1J8uBOz"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "He wants to know why we're helping a country with American blood on its hands.", "title": "Why This Wounded Iraq Veteran Opposed the Iran Deal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Bartlett.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "International", "tag": "middle east", "published_time": "2015-10-05T17:13:14+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-06T00:45:41+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Iran deal, Navy Sniper, nuclear bombs, Robert Bartlett"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe291d\"", "article_summary": "We can\u2019t, as Americans, be quiet when tyranny is at our door.\u201dBartlett has appeared on television opposing the Iran deal.\n\u201cWhat hit me in the head killed my buddy, and I have to be a voice for him,\u201d Bartlett says.\n\u201cWhen the director [of Veterans Against the Deal], Michael Pregent, reached out to me, he knew I\u2019d been hit by an Iranian bomb,\u201d Bartlett says.\nHe believes that the deal\u2019s supporters \u201cneed their heads examined.\u201d\u201cThey could walk away from the deal once they get the money,\u201d Bartlett says.\nHe\u2019s not supposed to be doing any of that.\u201dDespite last month\u2019s resolution rejection, Bartlett says the Veterans Against the Deal will not stop fighting to be heard."}
