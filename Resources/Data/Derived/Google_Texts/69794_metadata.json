The University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, near Phoenix, can hold 73,000 people. Last year\u2019s Super Bowl, at Met Life Stadium in East Rutherford, NJ, was attended by 82,529 fans.\n\nRelated: Your Best Travel Bargains for the Super Bowl\n\nAlthough ticket prices for the big football event went down by 18 percent immediately after the New England Patriots and the Seattle Seahawks won on Jan. 18 to reach the championship game \u2013 most likely due to people starting to get bored about watching the Patriots play in the Super Bowl for the eighth time \u2013 the prices quickly rose again last week.\n\nMeanwhile, between 171 million and 184 million people are expected to watch the game on TV on Sunday Feb. 1, up from 111.5 million last year. Many will be either hosting a party or attending one. Total spending on new TVs, athletic gear, decorations, and game day food \u2014 the most common expense \u2014 is expected to reach $14.3 billion, according to predictions from the National Retail Federation.\n\nChicken wings will be the grub of choice for many Americans: Some 1.25 billion wings will be gobbled up during Super Bowl Sunday, says the National Chicken Council, which tracks such things. The average wholesale price of wings is currently at $1.71 a pound, up from $1.35 at the same time last year but down from a record high of $2.11 in January 2013. Some of the most popular sauces include ranch dressing, barbeque sauce and blue cheese dressing.\n\nAs a bonus this year, viewers won\u2019t even need cable to watch the game at home. NBC said it plans to live stream the event online for free, including the half-time show, which features Kate Perry and Lenny Kravitz.\n\nRelated: Deflategate Follows Patriots to Super Bowl\n\nAmericans typically tune in to Super Bowl Sunday almost as much for the ads (41.3 percent of Americans surveyed by NRF) as they do for the game itself (46.8 percent). Naturally advertisers go to great length to reach these viewers.\n\nA 30-second ad spot costs, on average, $4.5 million, while advertisers are expected to spend a total of $359 million on the big game this year, according to data from WalletHub. Since 2010, Anheuser-Bush has spent $152 million on advertising during the Super Bowl.\n\nSome Super Bowl ads are already available to view online, including Victoria Secret\u2019s or this T-Mobile commercial, where Kim Kardashian makes fun of herself.\n\nRelated: Quantifying the Power of Kim Kardashian\u2019s Butt\n\nIt\u2019s increasingly questionable, however, whether the investment in TV air time as well as in a commercial\u2019s production costs are worth it for advertisers. New research from Stanford University suggests Super Bowl ads aren\u2019t always efficient at driving sales.\n\nWhile they can generate significant increases in sales revenue, especially for beer and soda companies, this isn\u2019t true when two competing brands both advertise during the Super Bowl.\n\n\u201cSuper Bowl ads can spur large increases in revenue and volume per household, but when two major competing brands advertise, most of the gains are eroded,\u201d wrote Clifton B. Parker at Phys.org Tuesday, citing the study.\n\nThis may be why some companies have chosen to cut back on the costs associated with producing TV ads. For the ninth year in a row, Doritos has asked the general public to submit a potential Super Bowl ad, slicing its production costs. It received almost 4,900 entries from around the world and has selected 10 finalists for the public to vote on.\n\nThe formula seems to be paying off: Dorito commercials during the Super Bowl have been some of the most effective of the big evening over the years.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The Super Bowl is getting bigger in every way this year, with the average ticket price reaching new highs and a record number of Americans planning to watch the game on TV.", "title": "Super Bowl XLIX Is Already Setting Records", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/01/27/Super-Bowl-XLIX-Already-Setting-Records", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/wpid-2014-09-24T154700Z_2_LYNXNPEA8N0PX_RTROPTP_2_NFL-SUPERBOWL.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/01/27/Super-Bowl-XLIX-Already-Setting-Records", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/wpid-2014-09-24T154700Z_2_LYNXNPEA8N0PX_RTROPTP_2_NFL-SUPERBOWL.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "The Super Bowl is getting bigger in every way this year, with the average ticket price reaching new highs and a record number of Americans planning to watch the game on TV.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcef38\"", "article_summary": "Last year\u2019s Super Bowl, at Met Life Stadium in East Rutherford, NJ, was attended by 82,529 fans.\nNew research from Stanford University suggests Super Bowl ads aren\u2019t always efficient at driving sales.\nSome Super Bowl ads are already available to view online, including Victoria Secret\u2019s or this T-Mobile commercial, where Kim Kardashian makes fun of herself.\nThe formula seems to be paying off: Dorito commercials during the Super Bowl have been some of the most effective of the big evening over the years.\nWhile they can generate significant increases in sales revenue, especially for beer and soda companies, this isn\u2019t true when two competing brands both advertise during the Super Bowl."}
