Twenty-nine percent report that the law has hurt their businesses directly.\n\nAlthough brokers say Obamacare is hurting their profits, that doesn\u2019t mean they haven\u2019t been working harder than ever. Respondents reported working intensively with Obamacare exchange customers \u2014 especially trying to get applicants through glitchy websites like HealthCare.gov.\n\nIt took 69 percent of brokers two or more sessions to get a customer through Healthcare.gov.\n\n\u201cThere has been a 300 percent increase in time spent sharing information compared to the past \u2014 about three hours per enrolled life,\u201d one broker said.\n\nThe insurance experts also have long-term concerns about the health-care law itself \u2014 not just their own ability to thrive. Twenty-three percent are worried about \u201cpremium stability\u201d under Obamacare and 16 percent don\u2019t believe the law is financially sustainable.

Six insurance brokers filed a class action lawsuit against the Nevada Obamacare exchange and its former contractor, Xerox, for failing to pay.

The hold-up is partly due to exchange officials failing to include broker information when sending electronic customer applications to insurance companies, The Washington Post reported.

Brokers now have a limit to the amount of revenue they\u2019re allowed to spend on \u201cadministrative overhead,\u201d which includes commissions \u2014 similar to the new limits on insurance companies\u2019 administrative spending.\n\n\u201cI think there is going to be an exodus of agents over the next 5 years,\u201d one respondent said.\n\n\u201cMany brokers who did work with me are leaving the business and there is no incentive for new people to go into insurance anymore,\u201d another warned.\n\nFollow Sarah on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Sarah Hurtubise", "description": "Independent brokers say they're worse off", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Insurance brokers' businesses are taking a hit due to Obamacare, according to a new survey from McKinsey and Company.\u00a0    One-third of independent insurance brokers say they're considering leaving th", "title": "Insurance Brokers: Obamacare Is Harder Work For Lower Pay", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/09/24/insurance-brokers-obamacare-is-harder-work-for-lower-pay/", "image": {"width": 630, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/obamacare.jpg", "height": 270}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Independent brokers say they're worse off", "title": "Insurance Brokers: Obamacare Is Harder Work For Lower Pay Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/09/24/insurance-brokers-obamacare-is-harder-work-for-lower-pay/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/obamacare.jpg"}, "creator": "@@SarahMHurtubise", "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-09-24 13:27:51", "sailthru.title": "Insurance Brokers: Obamacare Is Harder Work For Lower Pay", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "healthcare-gov,obamacare,sarah-hurtubise", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "healthcare.gov,obamacare", "sailthru.description": "Insurance brokers' businesses are taking a hit due to Obamacare, according to a new survey from McKinsey and Company.\u00a0    One-third of independent insurance brokers say they're considering leaving th", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/obamacare.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Six insurance brokers filed a class action lawsuit against the Nevada Obamacare exchange and its former contractor, Xerox, for failing to pay.\nOne-third of independent insurance brokers say they\u2019re considering leaving their profession entirely because of the health-care law, according to a nationwide survey of 1,000 independent brokers during Obamacare\u2019s first open enrollment period, the Washington Examiner reports.\nIn several states, brokers have reported that the exchanges aren\u2019t even paying brokers their commissions.\nAlthough brokers say Obamacare is hurting their profits, that doesn\u2019t mean they haven\u2019t been working harder than ever.\n(RELATED: Nevada Obamacare Exchange Isn\u2019t Paying Its Insurance Brokers)The Washington, D.C. exchange was also charged with similar claims after the first open enrollment period."}
