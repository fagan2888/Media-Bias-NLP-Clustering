But when will this country\u2019s love affair with meat and the unsanitary practices used to produce that meat come to a head? A recent study conducted by Consumer Reports has found that an alarming number of ground beef products found around the United States are contaminated with fecal matter. With Big Business\u2019s hands all over the beef monopoly in the U.S., it\u2019s becoming pretty clear that this is not a meat problem; it\u2019s a farming problem.\n\n\u201cThe most sustainable beef-production systems don\u2019t rely on any daily drugs, don\u2019t confine animals, and do allow them to eat a natural diet,\u201d said Dr. Urvashi Rangan, executive director of the Center for Food Safety and Sustainability at Consumer Reports, in a statement. \u201cOur findings show that more sustainable can mean safer meat. We suggest that you choose what\u2019s labeled \u2018grass-fed organic beef\u2019 whenever you can.\u201d\n\nWhere\u2019s The (Clean) Beef?\n\nResearchers from Consumer Reports purchased 300 packages of ground beef (458 pounds) from 103 grocery, big-box, and \u201cnatural\u201d food stores in 26 cities across the U.S. All types of ground beef were included in the study, especially conventional beef \u2014 the most common type of beef made from cattle that are fed antibiotics and other drugs to promote growth and prevent disease. They also purchased beef that was raised by more sustainable methods, such as organic and grass-fed.\n\nOut of all 458 pounds of ground beef purchased by the research team, each and every pound tested positive for fecal matter. Samples were also tested for the five most common types of bacteria found in ground beef - Clostridium perfringens, E. coli, Enterococcus, Salmonella, and Staphylococcus aureus. C. perfringens was found in around 20 percent of beef samples, S. aureus in 10 percent, and Salmonella in one percent. If you\u2019re not worried about that one percent: \u201cextrapolate that to the billions of pounds of ground beef we eat every year,\u201d Rangan pointed out.\n\nWhere Is All Of This Beef Coming From?\n\nWhere most of the beef in this country comes from: one of the four major companies with a stranglehold on this country\u2019s meat monopoly. Over 80 percent of America\u2019s beef comes from four companies: Tyson Foods, Cargill Meat Solutions Corp., JBS USA, National Beef Packing Co., affectionately known as the Big Four. As one could imagine, hot water, chlorine-based or lactic acid washes, and other sanitary practices often fall by the wayside when we\u2019re talking about 400 heads of cattle every hour.\n\n\u201cUSDA has a presence in these plants to do inspections \u2014 though it\u2019s against the companies\u2019 wishes,\u201d said Patty Lovera, assistant director of Food and Water Watch. \u201cThe economic power of the Big Four gives them a lot of political weight to push back against USDA inspectors\u2019 efforts to enforce existing rules and to fight against any tighter safety standards being enacted. The sheer volume of beef that big-company plants crank out means that a quality control mistake at a single plant can lead to packages of contaminated beef ending up in stores and restaurants across 20 or 30 states.\u201d\n\nLeave It To The Little Guy (Farm)\n\nAmerican cattle used by the Big Four are raised on feedlots \u2014 large plots of land where cattle are housed and fattened for production \u2014 for a couple of reasons. The main one is economic feasibility. Raising up to 18,000 cattle on one feedlot clearly has its financial advantages. It also has its disadvantages, like the corn and soy-based diets that destroy a cow\u2019s digestive tract, leading to ulcers and infection. Let\u2019s not forget about the unsanitary practice of situating cattle one on top of the other to ensure the spread of bacteria and disease.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture recommends no more than 11 animals for every 20 acres of pasture. Not only does this guarantee that each animal will get adequate nutrition, but it also safeguards against stressful environmental factors and produces lean beef free from antibiotic and hormone supplementation. Conventional cattle farmers argue that without feedlots beef production in America would plummet and beef would become more expensive. I don\u2019t know about you, but given the choice between expensive beef and beef covered in fecal matter, I\u2019m taking expensive beef 100 percent of the time.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "ground, beef, fecal, matter, feedlots, pasture", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A Consumer Reports study has found that most of the ground beef found in grocery stores across the United States has been contaminated with fecal matter.", "title": "That Ground Beef In Your Fridge Is Probably Covered In Poop", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/high-levels-fecal-matter-ground-beef-not-meat-problem-its-farming-problem-349368", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/08/25/feedlot-vs-pasture.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A Consumer Reports study has found that most of the ground beef found in grocery stores across the United States has been contaminated with fecal matter.", "title": "That Ground Beef In Your Fridge Is Probably Covered In Poop", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/high-levels-fecal-matter-ground-beef-not-meat-problem-its-farming-problem-349368", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/08/25/feedlot-vs-pasture.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/08/25/feedlot-vs-pasture.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-08-25T13:23:47-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-25T13:23:46-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A Consumer Reports study has found that most of the ground beef found in grocery stores across the United States has been contaminated with fecal matter."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfabd\"", "article_summary": "Out of all 458 pounds of ground beef purchased by the research team, each and every pound tested positive for fecal matter.\nSamples were also tested for the five most common types of bacteria found in ground beef - Clostridium perfringens, E. coli, Enterococcus, Salmonella, and Staphylococcus aureus.\nI don\u2019t know about you, but given the choice between expensive beef and beef covered in fecal matter, I\u2019m taking expensive beef 100 percent of the time.\nA recent study conducted by Consumer Reports has found that an alarming number of ground beef products found around the United States are contaminated with fecal matter.\nIf you\u2019re not worried about that one percent: \u201cextrapolate that to the billions of pounds of ground beef we eat every year,\u201d Rangan pointed out."}
