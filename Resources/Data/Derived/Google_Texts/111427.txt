Officials are looking into the cause of a fire Tuesday morning at a detached garage apartment in northwest Oklahoma City.

According to the fire department, at about 7 a.m., firefighters responded to the fire at a two-story garage apartment in the 2200 block of N.W. 34th Street. When firefighters arrived, they reported seeing heavy flames coming out of the front of the structure.

Officials said this was supposed to be a vacant structure with no utilities. However, someone was living upstairs and was bootlegging gas, water, and electricity.

Nobody was in the apartment at the time of the fire. The cause of the fire is under investigation.

The fire caused an estimated $40,000 damage to the structure.
