Kansas City Chiefs safety Eric Berry played his first regular season NFL game last weekend, just 10 months after he was diagnosed with Hodgkinâ€™s lymphoma.

Other professional athletes, such as hockey player Mario Lemieux and baseball player Jon Lester, have also recovered from lymphoma and resumed their careers.

From the Here & Now Contributors Network, Greg Echlin reports from Kansas City.
