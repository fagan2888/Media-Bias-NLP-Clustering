But how much do these cases really cost taxpayers?\n\nIt\u2019s not cheap when you consider the cost of the MMR vaccine, which prevents measles in 95 percent of people who get one dose and 99 percent in those who get both. The vaccine can range from $1.99 for a pediatric dose, $3.70 for an adult, up to $5.61 a dose in the private sector. This is not necessarily consumer cost, though, because the Affordable Care Act requires coverage for the MMR vaccine.\n\n\u201cThese outbreaks have economic costs. They are disruptive,\u201d Gregory Poland, head of the Mayo Clinic\u2019s Vaccine Research Group, told Forbes. \u201cThe smaller ones have cost a couple hundred dollars in public resources, and one cost nearly a million dollars. It\u2019s on the lesser side \u2013 health is more important \u2013 but it consumes public health resources that could be applied to the other pressing problems we face.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nForbes spelled out what the costs and numbers looked like just a few years ago:\n\nIn 2011, the cost of 107 cases spread across 16 outbreaks cost local and state health departments an estimated $2.7 million to $5.3 million. Because measles is so contagious, infecting 90 percent of susceptible individuals and remaining airborne up to two hours after an infectious person has left the area, the number of contacts a single case can generate grows exponentially once an outbreak begins. The cases in 2011 involved contacting somewhere between 8,900 and 17,450 individuals, which required 42,000 to 83,000 personnel hours.\n\nAnother cost factor to consider is what the families must not only pay in hospital bills when someone gets infected, but what kind of losses incur from needing to take time off work (more likely when a parent is caring for an infected child).\n\n\u201cWhile this cost can be absorbed by many employees through the use of sick days, employees with lower incomes are the least likely to have sick leave,\u201d said health economist Adam Powell, president of Payer+Provider Syndicate Healthcare Consulting. \u201cThe Economic Policy Institute reported that the median wage for people without sick days is $10 per hour. Assuming the person works five days a week, missing a week of work would cause a loss of $400. If the absence extended to eight days of work and two days of weekend as a result of a ten day illness, the loss would be $640.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes down to it, vaccinations are inexpensive and save not only lives but taxpayer money. Of course, money isn\u2019t really the biggest thing to be concerned about when it comes to measles, and it\u2019s not like the main anti-vaxxer argument is that they are trying to save money.
