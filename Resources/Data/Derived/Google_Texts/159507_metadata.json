Mondelez International Inc., Oreo\u2019s parent company, has heard the collective groan from health-conscious consumers and has decided to launch a more \u201csophisticated\u201d snack with fewer calories. \u201cOreo Thins\u201d are expected to hit the cookie market on July 13 and, according to the company, will provide a guilt-free snack for Oreo fans looking to watch their weight.\n\nNow, if you\u2019re like me, you may be thinking: So all they really did was take out the filling and leave us with two chocolate wafers with a thin slathering of cream. Actually, Oreo Thins offers the same cookie-to-filling ratio, just in a much slimmer cookie. While three regular Oreos contain 160 calories, four Oreo Thins contain 140 calories. Janda Lukin, senior director of Oreo in North America, told the Associated Press, \"If regular Oreos are like pancakes, then Oreo Thins would be like cr\u00eapes.\u201d\n\nUnlike limited edition flavors recently marketed by Oreo, Thins are set to be added to the company\u2019s official product line. They will be available in Original, Mint, and Golden. As an Oreo fan and a fitness enthusiast, I must say I am thoroughly excited about these new Oreo Thins. However, I do have one concern: How are we going to twist them open before dunking? The company\u2019s spokeswoman claims they weren\u2019t designed for this purpose, but we all know that\u2019s exactly what all Oreos are designed for.\n\nA more \"sophisticated\" snack for Oreo fans.
