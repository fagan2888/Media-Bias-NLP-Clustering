Sometimes when you challenge the status quo you make enemies -- it's why so few people lead.\u201d she said.\n\nFiorina said she plans to challenge the status quo through \u201cthe power of technology.\"\n\n\u201cWe need a leader in the White House who understands that their highest priority is to unlock the potential of this nation now. I am convinced that the citizens of this nation actually know what we need to do. The reason they are so frustrated and sick of politics and politicians is because some of these answers are so obvious and people give big speeches and yet nothing really seems to change,\u201d she said.\n\nShe commented on Hillary Clinton\u2019s e-mail scandal.\n\nMore On This... Carly Fiorina: U.S. is back in leadership business\n\n\u201cIt now appears that this server has been with some IT company in New Jersey since 2013-- I\u2019m pretty sure they scrubbed it thoroughly but it reminds me of the old adage, the cover up is always worse than the crime. The more we learn here, the more it appears that Hillary Clinton very purposefully and deliberately used a home-brewed system and made sure nobody knew what was on that home-brewed system,\u201d she said.\n\nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT\n\nShe said, if elected president, she would repeal Obamacare.\n\n\u201cWe have never tried the free market. Health insurance has always been a cozy little arrangement between regulators and health insurance companies. We used to do it on the 50 state level-- now all we have done is nationalize that. Let\u2019s actually have health insurance companies have to compete for everybody\u2019s business across state lines like we do homeowners insurance or car insurance or a whole set of other products,\u201d she said.\n\nFiorina also explained how she would approach relations with Russia and Vladimir Putin.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t talk to him. I\u2019ve met him and we\u2019ve talked way too much to him, but, Vladimir Putin will not stop until he faces, senses, strength and resolve on the other side. It is why we must immediately begin rebuilding the sixth fleet. It is why we must immediately begin building the missile defense program in Poland. I would conduct regular, aggressive military exercises in the Baltic States and I would be moving troops in and out of Germany. Vladimir Putin will get the message, but we ought to quit talking to him,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX BUSINESS/BUSINESS LEADERS,/FOX BUSINESS/GOVERNMENT AND INSTITUTIONS", "dcterms.modified": "2016-01-06 04:44:42 EST", "dc.type": "Text.Article", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/2015/08/14/carly-fiorina-leaders-are-made-not-born.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/media.foxbusiness.com/2015/08/14/0/0/081415_mm_fiorina.jpg?ve=1", "description": "In an interview on Mornings with Maria on the FOX Business Network, GOP hopeful Carly Fiorina discussed how she plans to challenge the status quo for working women in America.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Carly Fiorina: Leaders Are Made, not Born"}, "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.publisher": "Fox Business", "parsely-metadata": "{\"tags\":[\"/FOX BUSINESS/BUSINESS LEADERS\",\"/FOX BUSINESS/GOVERNMENT AND INSTITUTIONS\"],\"author\":\"Julia Limitone\",\"subSection\":\"politics\",\"title\":\"Carly Fiorina: Leaders Are Made, not Born\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/media.foxbusiness.com/2015/08/14/0/0/081415_mm_fiorina.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-08-14T15:41:01Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/2015/08/14/carly-fiorina-leaders-are-made-not-born.html\",\"type\":\"article\",\"identifier\":\"831d9c37-8121-49ff-b16e-c415913caf08\",\"section\":\"politics\"}", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "description": "In an interview on Mornings with Maria on the FOX Business Network, GOP hopeful Carly Fiorina discussed how she plans to challenge the status quo for working women in America.", "dc.description": "In an interview on Mornings with Maria on the FOX Business Network, GOP hopeful Carly Fiorina discussed how she plans to challenge the status quo for working women in America.", "dc.identifier": "831d9c37-8121-49ff-b16e-c415913caf08", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "pagetype": "article", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/mediumtile.png", "classification-isa": "bizleaders", "prism.channel": "fbn", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/widetile.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/smalltile.png", "prism.section": "politics", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/largetile.png", "fb": {"app_id": 116027085089150}, "dc.source": "FOXBusiness", "dc.language": "en-US", "dc.title": "Carly Fiorina: Leaders Are Made, Not Born", "dcterms.created": "2016-01-06 04:44:42 EST", "og": {"site_name": "Fox Business", "description": "In an interview on Mornings with Maria on the FOX Business Network, GOP hopeful Carly Fiorina discussed how she plans to challenge the status quo for working women in America.", "title": "Carly Fiorina: Leaders Are Made, not Born | Fox Business", "url": "http://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/2015/08/14/carly-fiorina-leaders-are-made-not-born.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/media.foxbusiness.com/2015/08/14/0/0/081415_mm_fiorina.jpg?ve=1", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.abstract": "In an interview on Mornings with Maria on the FOX Business Network, GOP hopeful Carly Fiorina discussed how she plans to challenge the status quo for working women in America.", "dc.date": "2015-08-14", "parsely-page": "{\"tags\":[\"/FOX BUSINESS/BUSINESS LEADERS\",\"/FOX BUSINESS/GOVERNMENT AND INSTITUTIONS\"],\"author\":\"Julia Limitone\",\"subSection\":\"politics\",\"title\":\"Carly Fiorina: Leaders Are Made, not Born\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/media.foxbusiness.com/2015/08/14/0/0/081415_mm_fiorina.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-08-14T15:41:01Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/2015/08/14/carly-fiorina-leaders-are-made-not-born.html\",\"post_id\":\"831d9c37-8121-49ff-b16e-c415913caf08\",\"type\":\"article\",\"section\":\"politics\"}", "dc.creator": "Julia Limitone"}, "article_summary": "Health insurance has always been a cozy little arrangement between regulators and health insurance companies.\nIn an interview on Mornings with Maria on the FOX Business Network, GOP hopeful Carly Fiorina discussed how she plans to challenge the status quo for working women in America.\nFiorina said she plans to challenge the status quo through \u201cthe power of technology.\"\nSometimes when you challenge the status quo you make enemies -- it's why so few people lead.\u201d she said.\nLet\u2019s actually have health insurance companies have to compete for everybody\u2019s business across state lines like we do homeowners insurance or car insurance or a whole set of other products,\u201d she said."}
