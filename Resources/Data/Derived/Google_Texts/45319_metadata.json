Well in the fight for the attention of college students, the Biebs takes the cake.\n\nThe 19-year-old pop star has been making headlines after his recent arrest in Miami Beach for drag racing, driving under the influence, resisting arrest and driving without a valid license. Only five days after Bieber\u2019s arrest, the President gave his State of the Union address.\n\nSo Media Research Center\u2019s Dan Joseph set out to find out which news story students at George Mason University, located minutes outside of Washington, D.C., knew more about \u2014 and the results weren\u2019t pretty.\n\n\u201cDid you hear about what happened to Justin Bieber recently?\u201d Joseph asked several students.\n\n\u201cHe was arrested for drag racing and driving under the influence,\u201d said one girl.\n\n\u201cYeah, everyone knows what happened to Justin Bieber,\u201d said another. She even knew his bail was only $2,500.\n\nUnfortunately, students weren\u2019t so sure how to answer Joseph\u2019s second question.\n\n\u201cThere was a big political event last night,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you know what it was?\u201d\n\n\u201cLast night?\u201d one student responded.\n\n\u201cYeah, Obama was talking\u2026\u201d another responded, but that was as far as she could get.\n\n\u201cHonestly, I watched it about a year ago and I was bored so that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t watch it this time,\u201d one bold student said. At least he was honest.\n\nFortunately, some knew that the State of the Union was the big political event that happened the night before, even if they had no idea what was actually said. One girl openly admitted to watching Pretty Little Liars instead.\n\n\u201cHe [Obama] could probably be on that show, although he\u2019s not that pretty,\u201d Joseph joked.\n\nLast year, MRCTV tested students knowledge on abortion when Joseph asked students to sign a petition legalizing abortion after the fourth trimester, or after the baby has already been born. Later in the year, Joseph returned to George Mason and quizzed students on the Gettysburg Address, finding that at one of the top schools in the country, many could not place the words \u201cfour score and seven years ago\u201d with both Abraham Lincoln and the correct speech.\n\nWatch the entire MRCTV video here to see all of the responses to the Biebs and Obama questions.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Who would win in a fight, Justin Bieber or President Barack Obama?
