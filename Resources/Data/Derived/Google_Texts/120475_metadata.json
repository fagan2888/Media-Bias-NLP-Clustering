Vilsack, guest columnist\n\nOn Feb. 1, 2016 I intend to proudly caucus for Hillary Clinton \u2014 plain and simple. Hillary Clinton is not new to the fight for middle class families. Throughout her public life she has consistently fought to expand and strengthen the middle class. I have no doubt she will continue that fight as president.\n\nExpanding and strengthening the middle class starts with quality jobs. Too often the discussion of good jobs fails to include the unique challenges faced by rural Americans. Hillary Clinton understands that some of the deepest and most pronounced poverty exists in rural areas of the country. Her strong support for the Renewable Fuel Standard and bio-based manufacturing as important parts of a revitalized rural economy makes clear she will work hard to promote meaningful economic opportunity throughout the country.\n\nHillary knows the economy of the future depends on a well-educated and trained workforce, and she understands the cost of education \u2014 from preschool to college and beyond \u2014 increasingly strains family budgets with unprecedented debt. That\u2019s why she\u2019s laid out a specific, workable plan to address these strains and make a good education available to all our children.\n\nHowever, a secure footing requires more than a good paying job and access to education. It means a foundation that cannot be undone by injury or illness. Hillary will preserve those protections gained under the Affordable Care Act instead of putting insurance companies in the driver\u2019s seat, and will look for ways to expand access to affordable health insurance coverage for all Americans and continue to bend the cost curve of health care.\n\nEvery Iowan knows good ideas aren\u2019t enough. We recognize the most successful presidents are those who can both lead and govern, while navigating the toughest job on earth.\n\nIn other words: Leadership inspires. Governance delivers.\n\nAs President, Hillary Clinton will both inspire and deliver results. I know because I have worked with her and called her a friend for nearly two decades.\n\nShe leads by example. Her courage in China as First Lady when she declared \u201cwomen\u2019s rights are human rights\u201d continues to inspire people all over the world to demand equality and freedom. As a twice-elected Senator, she worked with farmers to improve their prosperity in rural New York. And as Secretary of State, she helped to establish a program that delivers food assistance to over 12.5 million hungry children in some of the poorest countries in the world. This just scratches the surface of her career of inspiring and delivering for people around the country and across the globe.\n\nOn a personal note, Hillary Clinton is one of the most loyal people I know and that is rare in politics. My relationship with Hillary goes back a long way. Hillary and Tom Bell, my brother-in-law, became friends in 1972 when they worked together as staff members to the Congressional Watergate Hearings \u2014 long before she was a household name. When I was elected governor of Iowa in 1998, I met with President Bill Clinton in the Oval Office. In that private meeting, he gave me some very good advice. He encouraged me to stay true and loyal to the ideas I ran on and to the people who had faith in me to govern well. Hillary Clinton is one of those people.\n\nMy election that year was a surprise to many \u2014 but not Hillary. Despite the fact that I was way behind in the polls, she encouraged people she knew from all over the country to pitch in when I needed help, especially in the last weeks of the campaign. Without her support I may not have won.\n\nWhy did she do it? Loyalty.\n\nMany years before I met her and before she was known to Iowans, my brother-in-law told me how much he\u2019d liked and respected Hillary Clinton when they worked together.\n\nOver the past 15 years, I\u2019ve come to like and respect her, too.\n\nThat is why I support her.\n\nHillary Clinton has the right policies to strengthen and expand the middle class, is battle tested, and has the experience and relationships to lead and govern well. For all of those reasons as well as our friendship, I will caucus for Hillary Clinton on Feb. 1, 2016.\n\n\u2022 Thomas J. Vilsack is a former governor of Iowa.
