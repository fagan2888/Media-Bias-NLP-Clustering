Aim for online enrollment: Get into the 21st century and offer online enrollment. Only 35 percent of employees interviewed said online enrollment was available to them. Put it online and watch participation grow. 4. Communicate clearly: More than half of engaged employees say they are engaged because benefits materials are easy to understand, offer examples that reflect their own lives, and are personalized whenever possible.
