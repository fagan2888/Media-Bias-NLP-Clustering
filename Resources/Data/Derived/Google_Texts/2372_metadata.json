But thousands of children who are not eligible for Medicaid are going uninsured because of what\u2019s called the family glitch.\n\n\"And what that means is that if your family has access to employer coverage that\u2019s deemed affordable you cannot get a tax subsidy,\" Alker said.\n\nThe cost of buying insurance not just for one person also for a spouse and children significantly increases the price. Without that tax subsidy, insurance on the marketplace is unattainable for many families in the state.\n\nOnly Alaska and Texas have higher rates of children without insurance.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "https://www.azpm.org/p/top-health/2015/10/28/74948-arizona-has-the-third-highest-rate-of-uninsured-children-in-the-us/", "image": "https://media.azpm.org/master/image/2014/7/22/segment-thumb/group-of-children-thumb.jpg", "description": "Nationally, child uninsurance rate has dropped to historic lows.", "title": "Study: Arizona Has High Rate of Uninsured Children"}, "MSSmartTagsPreventParsing": "true", "publish_date": "2015-10-28T11:56:07", "Copyright": "Arizona Public Media, 2007-2012"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc94ee\"", "article_summary": "Without that tax subsidy, insurance on the marketplace is unattainable for many families in the state.\n\"And what that means is that if your family has access to employer coverage that\u2019s deemed affordable you cannot get a tax subsidy,\" Alker said.\nAccording to Alker, Arizona is the only state in the country to have closed its CHIP program.\nBut thousands of children who are not eligible for Medicaid are going uninsured because of what\u2019s called the family glitch.\nOne explanation for Arizona\u2019s persistently high child uninsurance rate is the state\u2019s decision to cancel its Children\u2019s Health Insurance, or CHIP program, said Joan Alker, executive director of Georgetown's Health Policy Institute Center for Children and Families."}
