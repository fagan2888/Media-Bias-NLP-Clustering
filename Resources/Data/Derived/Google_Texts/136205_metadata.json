At the same time, Medi-Cal reimbursements are going down. And the providers are responsible for expensive seismic retrofits and electronic health record systems.\n\n\"There are so many factors in our very rapidly changing health care landscape, that I think the safety net hospitals are certainly a group of facilities that are going to be at-risk,\" she says.\n\nEmerson-Shea says not every hospital that serves the poor will struggle financially.\n\nJerry Kominski of the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research says there's reason to be concerned about the prospect of safety-net hospitals closing.\n\n\"It means that particularly low-income patients, even if they have insurance, may be more likely to see hospital closures in their neighborhoods,\" he says.\n\n\"They [would] have further to go when they have an emergency, and that places more burden on populations that are already vulnerable,\" Kominski adds.\n\nDoctors Medical Center in the Northern Bay Area says it's facing closure in the next few weeks.\n\nAnd Daughters of Charity Health System, a network of charity hospitals and providers in the San Francisco Peninsula and Los Angeles says it's looking for a buyer to stay in business.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health Care,Business,State Government", "description": "Throughout California, many hospitals that serve mostly low-income patients face financial strains.
