Ted Cruz of Texas is visiting South Florida to help the Republican Party raise money \u2014 and at the same time audition for donors and activists who could prove valuable if he runs for president.\n\nCruz, who's become a favorite of the tea party movement and one of his party's most polarizing figures since his 2012 election, will be the keynote speaker for the Palm Beach County Republican Party's Lincoln Day Dinner on Friday.\n\nOn Thursday he appears in Sarasota.\n\nThe Palm Beach County party's dinner theme is \"United We Stand.\" Party Chairwoman Anita Mitchell said even though many South Florida Republicans aren't as conservative as Cruz, \"I think Ted's a great selection.\"\n\n\"There's nobody better than Cruz to come in and say we all come in and love one another,\" she said.\n\nMany of Cruz' fellow Republicans in the Senate aren't fans. He pushed the strategy that led to last fall's government shutdown, which ended with Republicans retreating in the face of plummeting public approval ratings.\n\nAnd this week he angered fellow Republicans by using a parliamentary maneuver that forced them to vote to raise the national debt ceiling. He then issued a statement many Republicans and Democrats \"are simply not listening to the American people.\"\n\nSo far, Florida voters have mixed views about Cruz. A Quinnipiac University Poll released Jan. 31 found just 9 percent of Florida Republicans would vote for him in a presidential primary. He was far behind former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "elections-politics, news", "og": {"site_name": "tribunedigital-sunsentinel", "description": "U.S. Sen.
