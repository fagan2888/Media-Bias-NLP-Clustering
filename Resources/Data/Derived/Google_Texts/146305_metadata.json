Chris Collins, R-Clarence, Wednesday voted no on the short-term budget agreement to end the 16-day government shutdown and prevent a historic and potentially horrific federal default \u2013 a deal that several of his Western New York colleagues reluctantly supported.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is, I didn\u2019t come here to kick the can,\u201d said Collins, who was elected to Congress last year. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t deal with any of our entitlement spending. It doesn\u2019t change the trajectory of our deficit, which is $700 billion a year. And therefore I can\u2019t support it, and I\u2019m going to vote no,\u201d he said before Wednesday night\u2019s 285-144 vote to approve the legislation.\n\nRep. Tom Reed, R-Corning, joined Collins in voting no, saying the deal failed to provide a long-term solution to the nation\u2019s fiscal problems while preserving the status quo of government by crisis.\n\n\u201cEnough is enough,\u201d Reed said. \u201cWe cannot keep borrowing to cover uncontrolled spending without jeopardizing our children and grandchildren\u2019s future. No one wants a default but that is exactly what will happen sooner or later if we do not deal with this problem.\u201d\n\nAsked if his \u201cno\u201d vote meant that he was willing to risk a federal default \u2013 which, many economists have said, could result in a recession or worse \u2013 Collins said: \u201cWhile I am concerned by it, quite frankly, in the long run, the biggest threat to long-term interest rates, whether it\u2019s mortgages or credit cards or business borrowing, is a national deficit of $700 billion a year that goes unchecked.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Rep. Brian Higgins, D-Buffalo, and Sens. Charles E. Schumer and Kirsten E. Gillibrand, D-N.Y., all voted for the legislation to fund federal agencies through Jan. 15, lift the debt ceiling through Feb. 7 and make no major changes to the Affordable Care Act, or \u201cObamacare,\u201d the health care overhaul that Republicans wanted to defund or delay.\n\nFor Higgins and Schumer, the legislation is nothing more than the lesser of evils. \u201cIt averts what would otherwise be a financial disaster, but it doesn\u2019t provide a long-term solution,\u201d Higgins said.\n\n\u201cIt will continue to send the wrong signal to the financial markets and the larger economy because what we\u2019re coming down to here is a quarterly budget battle and debt ceiling battle that do not provide any kind of long-term outlook that requires stability and certainly.\u201d\n\nStill, Higgins said he supported passage of the short-term stopgap out of fear of a federal default \u2013 which, according to some economists, could have produced an immediate stock market drop of 30 to 40 percent.\n\n\u201cThat is serious, serious stuff,\u201d said Higgins, chiding the tea party Republicans in the House who pushed the GOP leadership into a shutdown and debt ceiling showdown over defunding or delaying the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cWhat you\u2019re basically saying to a retiree is that here is a tea party-influenced capital gains tax on you.\u201d\n\nHiggins called the stopgap spending measure \u201cthe best of bad choices,\u201d and Schumer agreed.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a day for happiness or exaltation,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cWe spent two weeks risking extreme danger merely to end up right where we started: opening the government, paying our bills and negotiating a budget.\u201d\n\nGillibrand said it\u2019s time for Congress to move on. \u201cI\u2019m relieved we have bipartisan deal to avoid default and reopen the federal government. Now Congress must refocus on creating jobs and growing the economy for the American people,\u201d she said.\n\nSchumer sounded relieved, as well.\n\n\u201cIf there is a silver lining in this cloud,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s that hopefully this debacle means that the power of those that favor confrontation has peaked and we can start legislating again, in a bipartisan way, without this dangerous brinkmanship.\u201d\n\nemail: jzremski@buffnews.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Rep.
