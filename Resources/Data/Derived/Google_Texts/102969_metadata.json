Last week, Fox News didn\u2019t even bother airing the group\u2019s official response to Barack Obama\u2019s speech, in which the president forcefully called for an end to tactics that prevent the government \u201cfrom carrying out even the most basic functions of our democracy.\u201d Even Speaker of the House John Boehner, who seemed so downtrodden last year, now has an extra spring in his step, and is daring to push for immigration reform over the vocal objections of the far right. All but the most extreme Republicans have abandoned their shutdown tactics, and though the GOP still vows to repeal Obama\u2019s signature health law given the chance, the changing power dynamics on Capitol Hill are palpable.\n\nIndeed, it\u2019s been a rough few months for the Tea Party. Fewer Americans than at any time since 2010 now call themselves members or supporters of the group. The tactic of running far-right candidates in Republican primaries clearly cost the GOP control of the Senate in 2010 and again in 2012. Their intransigence also helped to prevent Mitt Romney from defeating the president they have so vilified. All this has sparked counter-mobilization by the GOP Old Guard too: Since last fall\u2019s ill-conceived Tea Party-led gambit to shut down the government, defund the Affordable Care Act and potentially default on the national debt, establishment Republicans have boldly lashed out at conservative outside groups that once had them cowering in fear, while pouring millions of dollars into races across the country to bolster moderates against right-wing insurgents.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nAt the same time, some of the leading Tea Party figures on the national stage are now departing from elective office, including Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.), who won\u2019t seek reelection this year, and Jim DeMint of South Carolina, who left the Senate last year to become president of the Heritage Foundation. Others have consolidated their positions as national laughingstocks\u2014most notably former veep wannabe Sarah Palin, but also the filibustering, Dr. Seuss-reading Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) who seems to be following the same trajectory, only faster. Others have been busy distancing themselves from the Tea Party, such as Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) taking a more moderate stance on immigration and Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) choosing to emphasize civil liberties over more radical tactics..\n\nThere may still be plot twists, turns and even reversals ahead for the Tea Party, but the main question now is not if the group is in decline but what its endgame will be. Tea Party proponents have been quick to claim a long and victorious lineage in U.S. history, ranging from their namesake tax revolt in Boston in 1773 to the 1978 anti-tax Proposition 13 rebellion in California. It\u2019s no surprise that the Tea Party is eager to stress such antecedents, since both led to huge victories: the American Revolution and the rise of Reaganism. Both historic episodes also share a heroic story of grassroots anti-government struggle followed by a supposed triumph of liberty.\n\nSo how does the Tea Party\u2019s story end? Consider a wider lens, one that includes comparable movements in other democracies. The Tea Party is but one example of a common form of political insurgency\u2014one that almost always loses in the long run. This kind of counter-establishment movement is common enough that comparative politics has a term for it: the \u201canti-system party\u201d\u2014a group that seeks to obstruct and delegitimize the entire political system in which the government functions. As explained by Giovanni Sartori, the Italian political scientist who coined the term in 1976, an anti-system is driven not by \u201can opposition on issues\u201d but \u201can opposition of principle.\u201d\n\n\u201cAn anti-system party would not change\u2014if it could\u2014the government but the very system of government,\u201d Sartori wrote. \u201c[A]n anti-system opposition abides by a belief system that does not share the values of the political order within which it operates.\u201d\n\nSartori had foremost in mind the various communist parties active in Western Europe during the Cold War, but the concept has been applied to movements as varied as right-wing nationalists, radical libertarians and ethnic separatists all across the world.\n\nWithout adopting the phrase itself, the Tea Party in both words and deeds has positioned itself as America\u2019s newest anti-system party. Claiming the mantle of patriotism, Tea Partiers say they love the United States while hating the U.S. government\u2014its practices, its rules and especially its procedures for achieving compromise and consensus. The litany of anti-government Tea Party efforts is by now familiar. In Congress: shutting down the government, abusing the filibuster, threatening a default on the debt. During elections: suppressing the minority vote under the guise of fraud prevention, undermining the Voting Rights Act, aggressively gerrymandering for partisan advantage, challenging the citizenship of the president. In political rhetoric: vilifying the \u201c47 percent\u201d who are \u201cbribed\u201d by the welfare state, denouncing Republican-inspired and market-based health care reforms as socialism, lamenting the passing of the white Christian conservative hegemony of \u201creal America.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO Magazine", "description": "The main question now is not if the group is in decline but what its endgame will be.", "title": "How Do Tea Parties End?", "url": "http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/02/tea-party-how-will-it-end-102984.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/02/01/140201_smith_cruz_ap_1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Tea Party,GOP,Politics,Rand Paul,John Boehner,Ted Cruz", "twitter": {"site": "@politicomag", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politicomag"}, "description": "The main question now is not if the group is in decline but what its endgame will be.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe05a3\"", "article_summary": "Without adopting the phrase itself, the Tea Party in both words and deeds has positioned itself as America\u2019s newest anti-system party.\nIndeed, it\u2019s been a rough few months for the Tea Party.\nJust how close is the Tea Party to its demise?\nThe litany of anti-government Tea Party efforts is by now familiar.\nIt\u2019s no surprise that the Tea Party is eager to stress such antecedents, since both led to huge victories: the American Revolution and the rise of Reaganism."}
