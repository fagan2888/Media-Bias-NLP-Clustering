James also had 11 rebounds and eight assists.\n\nIsaiah Thomas led the Celtics with 27 points and Jared Sullinger had 17 with 13 rebounds.\n\nThe Cavs were clinging to a seven-point lead in the fourth when they opened some distance over the up-and-coming Celtics with a 7-0 run triggered by a 3-pointer by J.R. Smith. On Cleveland\u2019s next possession, James blasted down the lane for a layup and Shumpert capped the spurt with a jumper. Smith, who added 14 points, later knocked down a 3-pointer with 2:03 left, ending any thought Boston had of a late comeback.\n\nOn their previous visit to Cleveland, the Celtics rallied in the final seconds to beat the Cavs 104-103 on Feb. 5. Avery Bradley hit a game-winning 3-pointer from the corner at the horn for Boston, which trailed by four with 7 seconds remaining.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s be honest, we were really lucky to win here last time,\u201d coach Brad Stevens said. \u201cThat was a very fortunate deal.\u201d\n\nStevens said the Celtics would have to play better this time, and his team came out determined not to fall behind.\n\nBoston came out with confidence and quickly took control, opening an 18-point lead in the first quarter. The Celtics were still up by 14 midway through the second quarter when the Cavs, who gave up 35 points in the first 21 minutes, began to buckle down on defense.", "article_metadata": {"description": "LeBron scores 28, leads balanced Cavs past Celtics 120-103", "title": "LeBron scores 28, leads balanced Cavs past Celtics 120-103", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "LeBron scores 28, leads balanced Cavs past Celtics 120-103", "title": "LeBron scores 28, leads balanced Cavs past Celtics 120-103", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/03/06/lebron_scores_28_leads_balanced_cavs_past_celtics_120_103/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/celtics-cavaliers-basketball.jpeg1-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "LeBron scores 28, leads balanced Cavs past Celtics 120-103", "title": "LeBron scores 28, leads balanced Cavs past Celtics 120-103", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/celtics-cavaliers-basketball.jpeg1-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Tom Withers", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "On their previous visit to Cleveland, the Celtics rallied in the final seconds to beat the Cavs 104-103 on Feb. 5.\nThe Cavs were down 18 points in the first quarter but regrouped and stopped Boston\u2019s winning streak at five games.\nIsaiah Thomas led the Celtics with 27 points and Jared Sullinger had 17 with 13 rebounds.\nSmith, who added 14 points, later knocked down a 3-pointer with 2:03 left, ending any thought Boston had of a late comeback.\nBoston came out with confidence and quickly took control, opening an 18-point lead in the first quarter."}
