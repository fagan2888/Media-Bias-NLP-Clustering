So it\u2019s good timing that the Obama administration just nominated one of America\u2019s leading relational architects for a pivotal role.\n\nThe White House announced yesterday that Rabbi David Saperstein, 66, head of U.S. Reform Judaism's public policy arm, will be the administration\u2019s nominee as Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Freedom. The \u201cIRF Ambassador,\u201d as the position is known in diplomatic circles, is an important job in American foreign policy: our government\u2019s roving watchdog advocating for persecuted religious minorities worldwide. The position has been vacant for nearly a year, and anxious advocates had hoped that, given the scale of religious crises today, a foreign policy heavyweight would fill this spot.\n\n\n\nWell, they got their wish. Saperstein, a lawyer by training, is known as a political powerhouse, someone who has the ears of top White House officials and a fair number of members of Congress as well. (Republican Rep. Frank Wolf of Virginia called Saperstein\u2019s nod \u201ca good nomination\u201d and urged quick Senate confirmation, and Rep. Ted Deutch of Florida, the leading Democrat on the House's Mid-East Subcommittee, tweeted his congratulations). Saperstein helped pass the Religious Freedom Restoration Act in 1993, was founding chair of the Congressionally-chartered U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom in 1999, and Newsweek named him the country\u2019s most influential rabbi in 2009. As one of the Jewish community's top policy advocates on Capitol Hill, his hands have been in debates from immigration to Obamacare.\n\nBut what's perhaps most interesting about Saperstein is the depth of support for him from diverse leaders across the American faith spectrum, outside of his own progressive Jewish community. I reached out to clergy and scholars from conservative evangelicals to American Muslims to African-American civil rights leaders, and their comments struck a similar chord.\n\nJoel Hunter, a prominent evangelical leader and senior pastor of the Northland megachurch outside of Orlando, Florida, told me, \u201cDavid has always been a close friend to the evangelical community \u2026 he is one of the most respected religious leaders in the country precisely because of his ability to connect with communities outside of his own.\u201d The sentiment was echoed by the conservative Beckett Fund for Religious Liberty, which applauded Saperstein\u2019s nomination.\n\nDr. Najeeba Syeed-Miller, a professor at Claremont School of Theology and one of the nation\u2019s leading Muslim scholars, said in an interview that Saperstein \u201chas been a mentor to me \u2026 he was a keynote speaker at a Muslim peace-building conference I put together, and helped incubate the \u2018shoulder-to-shoulder\u2019 campaign, an interfaith response to discrimination against Muslims. His knowledge of the Muslim community\u2019s challenges, demographics, historical experience and assets are matched by very few people in the United States.\u201d\n\nOtis Moss, Jr., the noted African-American civil rights leader and confidant of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., concurred. Moss called the selection \u201ca superb appointment at a critical time,\u201d recalling Saperstein\u2019s membership on the national board of the NAACP. (Saperstein, somewhat unique among rabbis, is a frequent speaker at black churches, preaching with the fire and cadence of a Baptist minister.)\n\nThe nomination also speaks to the strength of Melissa Rogers, the administration\u2019s faith-based advisor and head of the Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships (full disclosure: my former role in government). Saperstein and Rogers are close friends and long-time confidants, and the fact that Rogers shepherded him to nomination underscores her position within the White House.\n\nIf confirmed, Rabbi Saperstein will have more than his share of work cut out for him. The divide between Jews and Muslims in the Middle East seems almost unbridgeable at the moment, and the plight of Christians in Iraq and elsewhere in the region is approaching genocidal proportions. Not to mention monks in China, Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses in Russia, Jews in increasingly anti-Semitic Europe, and various other threatened groups around the globe. Further, the rabbi will have to navigate a byzantine State Department hierarchy and ensure that the IRF Ambassador role has real authority, rather than being layered under Foggy Bottom\u2019s notorious bureaucracy.\n\nBut if Saperstein\u2019s history is any indicator, he\u2019s as prepared as anyone for the task. As Joel Hunter, the evangelical pastor, said, \u201cDavid has the relational network, the political experience, and the intellectual prowess to make this office effective in expanding religious freedom around the world.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "JoshuaDuBois"}, "keywords": "u.s. poli", "publicationDate": 201407291835, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "news_keywords": "US Politics", "pageNum": 1, "title": "Religious Leaders Hail Obamas New Ambassador", "tags": "topic:politics", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "Once named the most influential rabbi in America, David Saperstein has forged strong bonds with America\u2019s religious groups\u2014who are thrilled to see him nominated as Obama\u2019s ambassador for religious freedom.", "title": "Religious Leaders Hail Obama\u2019s New Ambassador", "url": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/07/29/religious-leaders-hail-obama-s-new-ambassador.html", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/07/29/religious-leaders-hail-obama-s-new-ambassador/jcr:content/image.img.2000.jpg/1406665035459.cached.jpg", "type": "article"}, "environment": "dev", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "type": "house", "description": "Once named the most influential rabbi in America, David Saperstein has forged strong bonds with America\u2019s religious groups\u2014who are thrilled to see him nominated as Obama\u2019s ambassador for religious freedom.", "sectionTaxanomies": "politics", "fb": {"admins": "1703087,30000737,1117577220,1276800108,931159,514915512", "app_id": 189930913679}, "authors": "Joshua DuBois", "article": {"section": "politics", "published_time": "2014-07-29T18:35:00.000Z", "author": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/joshua-duboishtml"}, "resourceType": "dailybeast2/components/pages/article", "contentpath": "/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/07/29/religious-leaders-hail-obama-s-new-ambassador", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Religious Leaders Hail Obama\u2019s New Ambassador\",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/07/29/religious-leaders-hail-obama-s-new-ambassador.html\",\"image_url\":\"http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/07/29/religious-leaders-hail-obama-s-new-ambassador/jcr:content/image.crop.410.273.jpg/46888834.cached.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/07/29/religious-leaders-hail-obama-s-new-ambassador\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-07-29T18:35:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"Politics\",\"author\":\"Joshua DuBois\",\"tags\":[\"politics\"]}", "authorIds": "/etc/authors/j/joshua-dubois", "content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1d04\"", "article_summary": "Universal AcclaimOnce named the most influential rabbi in America, David Saperstein has forged strong bonds with America\u2019s religious groups\u2014who are thrilled to see him nominated as Obama\u2019s ambassador for religious freedom.\nIf confirmed, Rabbi Saperstein will have more than his share of work cut out for him.\nSaperstein helped pass the Religious Freedom Restoration Act in 1993, was founding chair of the Congressionally-chartered U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom in 1999, and Newsweek named him the country\u2019s most influential rabbi in 2009.\nThe White House announced yesterday that Rabbi David Saperstein, 66, head of U.S. Reform Judaism's public policy arm, will be the administration\u2019s nominee as Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Freedom.\nAs Joel Hunter, the evangelical pastor, said, \u201cDavid has the relational network, the political experience, and the intellectual prowess to make this office effective in expanding religious freedom around the world.\u201d"}
