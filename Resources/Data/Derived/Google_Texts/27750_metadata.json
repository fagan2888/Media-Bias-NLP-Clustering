(Photo: Doug Hood/Staff Photographer)Buy Photo\n\nFifty years ago children flocked to the West Side Community Center for ping-pong, dance classes, talent shows and summer cook-outs.\n\nIt was a hub for local families to gather in the southwest quadrant. A safe haven for youth to go to after school.\n\nThose days, residents say, are long gone.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s dismal,\u201d said former city mayor Kevin Sanders, who grew up attending the center\u2019s activities. \u201cIt\u2019s a shadow of what it was.\u201d\n\nThe aging facility is in disrepair and the lack of funding in recent years has left it with a scarce list of programs and offerings for the community.\n\nIn fact, the only daily activity for youth at the West Side Community Center today is open gym for four hours on weeknights, according to Lori Ross, the acting executive director and board president.\n\nPerhaps the biggest blow to the community center came in 2012 when it lost its 501C3 status, meaning charitable contributions were no longer tax-deductible. In many cases, private foundations will not give grants to organizations that are not tax-exempt, experts say.\n\nThe idle state of the West Side Community Center has made many residents concerned that the city\u2019s youth have nowhere to go when they aren\u2019t in school.\n\nIt\u2019s become such a pressing issue that outgoing Mayor Myra Campbell announced last week that her first priority upon leaving office is to save the troubled center.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see any life there,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cI don\u2019t see neighborhood children going in and participating in activities.\u201d\n\nCampbell said she is organizing a plan to \u201cresurrect the West Side Community Center so that it becomes a vibrant, lively building that the community can use.\u201d\n\nCenter\u2019s woes\n\nRoss said the center is still functioning with its limited resources, but admits she could use more support from area organizations.\n\nRoss is seeking partnerships that will provide funding and programming at the West Side Community Center.\n\n\u201cWe are not dead, we are alive,\u201d Ross said. \u201cBut we do need help.\u201d\n\nThe center has continued some services, such as summer camp and a young adult at-risk program, Ross said. And she also rents it out for events, church services and wedding receptions, which generates money for the facility.\n\nHowever, it has been difficult to garner support from some groups in recent years because of the high crime on Dewitt Avenue, where the center is located, Ross said.\n\nDewitt Avenue has been the site of shootings, murders and drug dealing in the last several years with some incidents happening directly in front of the center. At least three people were shot on Dewitt Avenue in 2013 and one person in 2014, according to police records.\n\nRoss said she is looking to create a recovery plan that includes working closely with the city\u2019s police department to ensure safety at the center.\n\nDeputy Police Chief Anthony Salerno said police increased their mobile and walking patrols in the neighborhoods surrounding the West Side Community Center this year. Officers also patrol the area when there are events taking place.\n\nThe police presence, Salerno said, has reduced the crime in that neighborhood in recent months. Asbury Park police are committed to working with Ross and the community center, the deputy chief said.\n\n\u201cWe can make sure we know what they are doing and we know what their needs are and that we can work around that and get officers when and where they are needed,\u201d Salerno said.\n\nFunding\n\nAside from crime, the West Side Community Center is in dire need of funding.\n\nRev. John Bradley, vice president of the center\u2019s board of directors, said the loss of the 501C3 status in 2012 has made it nearly impossible to raise funds.\n\nThe IRS website stated that it revokes an organization\u2019s 501C3 when it fails to file a Form 990-series return or notice for three consecutive years.\n\nRoss declined to provide an explanation for why the center didn\u2019t file.\n\n\u201cIt was something that happened that we are now rectifying,\u201d Ross said.\n\nBoth Ross and Bradley said the center could benefit from a better relationship with the city.\n\nRoss has publicly accused the city of not providing jobs, funding or opportunities for residents on the west side.\n\nShe said Campbell and city officials have not been helpful in seeking funding for the community center\u2019s revival.\n\nCassandra Dickerson, the city\u2019s department head for community development, said that is not the case.\n\nAsbury Park recently advertised the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) which provides federal funding for muncipalities to address community needs. Any organization in the city can apply for portions of the grant, Dickerson said.\n\nIn 2012, the city granted the West Side Community Center $68,000 in CDBG funds to renovate its bathrooms.\n\nThe center did not apply for the CDBG grant in 2013 or 2014, according to Dickerson.\n\nCenter\u2019s needs\n\nSo what will it take to save the West Side Community Center?\n\nBradley said the center needs to hire an advisory council of professionals to assist its leadership with obtaining funding from different resources. He also said the center needs to expand its board of directors with new members.\n\n\u201cAnd they can give us some guidance on how to come out of the situation that we are in now,\u201d Bradley said. \u201cAnd try to get our heads above water and get some programs going.\u201d\n\nDerrick Griggs, who grew up going to the West Side Community Center, said the city needs a venue to keep youth off the streets and out of trouble.\n\nGriggs said some in the community have lost faith in the center\u2019s leadership after years of no progression.\n\n\u201cIt was always just a nice, comfortable place for myself and other youth to go,\u201d said Griggs, 39, of Neptune. \u201cNow it seems like there isn\u2019t anything going on.\u201d\n\nThe center\u2019s deteriorating physical state is also a concern for community members. Ross said she is seeking funding for renovations.\n\nIsiah Jones, who also grew up in Asbury Park, said the center needs a complete overhaul so it can restore pride in the community.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look welcoming,\u201d said Jones, 33. \u201cIf we invest in it and raise the standards of the facility, I think it will change people\u2019s approach to that neighborhood.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.app.com/16FFJr7", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "The aging facility in Asbury Park, New Jersey is in disrepair and the lack of funding in recent years has left it with a scarce list of programs and offerings for the community.", "og": {"site_name": "Asbury Park Press", "description": "The aging facility in Asbury Park, New Jersey is in disrepair and the lack of funding in recent years has left it with a scarce list of programs and offerings for the community.", "title": "Can the West Side Community Center be saved?", "url": "http://www.app.com/story/news/local/monmouth-county/2014/12/21/can-west-side-community-center-saved/20724627/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/app.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The aging facility in Asbury Park, New Jersey is in disrepair and the lack of funding in recent years has left it with a scarce list of programs and offerings for the community.", "creator": "@AsburyParkPress", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0fe2e8d64625e9e676d84e7eac1f6fc52703ff9a/c=400-0-1999-1599&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/AsburyPark/2014/12/21/B9315553454Z.1_20141221095327_000_GRM9F7IF4.1-0.jpg", "title": "Can the West Side Community Center be saved?", "site": "@AsburyParkPress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600068887", "fb": {"app_id": 116172675120111}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/nicquel.terry"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Asbury Park, New Jersey, West Side Community Center, Monmouth County"}, "article_summary": "(Photo: Doug Hood/Staff Photographer)Buy PhotoFifty years ago children flocked to the West Side Community Center for ping-pong, dance classes, talent shows and summer cook-outs.\nIn 2012, the city granted the West Side Community Center $68,000 in CDBG funds to renovate its bathrooms.\nDeputy Police Chief Anthony Salerno said police increased their mobile and walking patrols in the neighborhoods surrounding the West Side Community Center this year.\nPerhaps the biggest blow to the community center came in 2012 when it lost its 501C3 status, meaning charitable contributions were no longer tax-deductible.\nRoss is seeking partnerships that will provide funding and programming at the West Side Community Center."}
