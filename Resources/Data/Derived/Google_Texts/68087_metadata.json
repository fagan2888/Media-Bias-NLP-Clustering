She\u2019s from California. She\u2019s pregnant. And she has Type I diabetes.\n\nAlthough she\u2019s not sure whether she\u2019ll switch over from her current plan, she says she likes having the option to do so.\n\nHere\u2019s how the White House described Allison ahead of the speech:\n\nKarmel Allison was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes when she was nine years old. She has stayed on the same insurance ever since, despite constantly rising costs, for fear she would not be able to find a plan that would cover her due to her pre-existing condition. Allison recently began researching her options on CoveredCA and has publically [sic] described her experience as finally feeling equal to others, including her young and healthy husband, when it comes to access to coverage. She still has not decided whether she will switch over to Obamacare. Share:\n\nHer Type I diabetes, which she was diagnosed with before she enrolled in her current plan, is considered by many insurers to be a \u201cpre-existing condition.\u201d And because her condition is considered \u201cpre-existing,\u201d she has spent the past few decades hesitant to switch plans for fear of losing coverage.\n\nShe even said she felt \u201cmarried\u201d to her current plan.\n\nHowever, that may change because Obamacare makes it illegal to deny coverage based on \u201cpre-existing\u201d conditions.\n\n\u201cI had never actively looked for other coverage, because what I had was working, and the message I was getting from all the other insurance companies was, \u2018Why would we cover a Type 1 diabetic? There\u2019s no obligation for us to do that. And we\u2019re not going to do that for anything remotely close to affordable,\u2019\u201d Allison told Business Insider.\n\nShe is currently reviewing her options on CoveredCA.com, California\u2019s exchange website.\n\n\u201cWhen I went on the website, I wasn\u2019t even necessarily looking to purchase coverage, which is why it was kind of a shocking experience that I was touched by it,\u201d she said. \u201cMy husband and I are reviewing our options, now that we have other options.\u201d\n\nShe wrote a blog post on October 7 describing her experience as a diabetic navigating the new Obamacare online exchanges. Her post was quickly picked up by several outlets and eventually made its way to the White House. That\u2019s how she got an invite to Monday\u2019s Rose Garden event.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just very grateful to the President for all the work he\u2019s done to get this law enacted, and I\u2019m very grateful to the ADA for all they did to allow me to be here, and for all they do on a regular basis,\u201d Allison said.\n\n\u2013\n\nFollow Becket Adams (@BecketAdams) on Twitter\n\nThis post has been updated.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "By now you've probably seen the video of a young woman nearly passing out during President Barack Obama\u2019s health care speech in the Rose Garden Monday.
