He had collapsed from exhaustion and both eyes had popped out of their sockets.\n\nEmergency animal medical technicians came to his aid and rushed him to AHS\u2019 animal hospital, where veterinarians performed an emergency surgery to remove both of his eyes, which were causing him intense pain.\n\nAlthough Ashton healed quickly after his surgery, he initially struggled to adjust to life as a blind dog. The AHS dog training team has been working with him extensively and he is now learning how to cope.\n\nThe team has been working to teach Ashton how to utilize his other senses to navigate through life. Despite not being able to see, Ashton hasn't skipped a beat \u2013 the resilient and determined dog carries on with a tail wag and an unwavering spirit. He plays in the yard, has learned new tricks and loves belly rubs from staff and volunteers.\n\nAshton is in search of a special family to give him a forever home. He doesn\u2019t need much, just a lot of love and perhaps a canine pal to help him navigate through the world.\n\nHe is available with an adoption fee of $110 that includes all of his medical treatment, neuter surgery and vaccinations.\n\nFor more information on adopting Ashton, call the Adoption Center at 602-997-7585.\n\nCopyright 2016 KPHO/KTVK (KPHO Broadcasting Corporation).
