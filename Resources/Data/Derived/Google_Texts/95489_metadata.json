Kennedy was a boy, his mother counseled her children on Good Fridays to pray for a peaceful death.\n\nYoung Jack joked that he\u2019d rather pray for two pet dogs.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for the CliffsNotes version of Kennedy\u2019s Catholicism, that anecdote touches on the key themes: the pious Irish mother, the light-hearted irreverence, the ever-present prospect of death.\n\nBut there\u2019s much more to the story.\n\nIn the words of one biographer, Kennedy was Mr. Saturday Night but also Mr. Sunday Morning, rarely missing a Mass.\n\nHe was famously unfaithful to his wife but fiercely loyal to his church, even when it threatened his quest for the presidency.\n\nOne scholar suggests that Kennedy was becoming more religious as the Cold War wore on. Another says that Kennedy\u2019s public displays of piety were little more than political lip service.\n\nAs the country marks the 50th anniversary of Kennedy\u2019s death - and it was far from peaceful, as we all know - almost every aspect of his life is again under the media microscope. But for all the ballyhoo about Kennedy being the first and only Catholic president, the topic of his faith remains largely untouched.\n\nWe\u2019ve been told that he was venerated by many who shared his religion and vilified by many who didn\u2019t. We know that his family shared sacraments with popes and confidences with cardinals. And we\u2019ve heard about Kennedy breaking more than a few Commandments.\n\nWe also know that Catholics, particularly Irish Catholics, revere Kennedy, hanging his portrait in their parlors next to images of the Sacred Heart, naming their schools and children after him.\n\nBut the halo around Kennedy\u2019s head has dimmed in recent decades as revelations about his marital infidelities and carefully concealed health problems have come to light.\n\n\u201cBeing the first of any group to get to the White House is worth taking seriously and showing respect for,\u201d said the Rev. John Langan, a Jesuit priest and ethicist at Georgetown University. \u201cBut there is bound to be a very ambivalent reaction to Kennedy at this point in our history.\u201d\n\nThat still doesn\u2019t tell us much about what kind of Catholic Kennedy was, to the extent that we can ever know.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to look into the soul of a person, especially a person who\u2019s been dead for 50 years, and judge their religion and belief in God,\u201d said Thomas Maier, author of \u201cThe Kennedys: America\u2019s Emerald Kings.\u201d\n\nNo doubt Maier is right. But Kennedy's Catholic faith remains central to questions about his character and his legacy. And even if we reserve final judgment for the Almighty, we can still probe history for clues about how religion inspired and guided his short and star-crossed life.\n\nThe Irish Catholic ideal\n\nWhen Kennedy was 13 and attending a Catholic school for the only time in his life, a visiting missionary spoke to the students about his work in India.\n\nAfterward, Kennedy eagerly informed his parents that \u201cit was one of the most interesting talks I\u2019ve ever heard,\u201d according to the Robert Dallek biography \u201cAn Unfinished Life.\u201d\n\nThe Catholic missionary inspired two aims that day that would drive Kennedy for the rest of his life, according to Ted Sorensen, one of his closest advisers: the desire to enjoy the world, and the desire to improve it.\n\nFew historians argue that Kennedy\u2019s reputation as a womanizer isn\u2019t well-warranted. But even tough-minded idealists such as Eleanor Roosevelt, who once regarded Kennedy as cocky and callow, eventually saw him in another light.\n\n\u201cMy final judgment is that here is a man who wants to leave a record (perhaps for ambitious personal reasons, as people say), but I rather think because he is really interested in helping the people of his own country and mankind in general,\u201d Roosevelt said after meeting Kennedy in 1960.\n\nKennedy put his personal mission another way: \u201cThose to whom much is given, much is required.\u201d That phrase echoes Luke\u2019s Gospel, which, like many parts of the Bible, he learned from his mother, Rose.\n\nJoseph Kennedy, the family patriarch, was often away making his millions and insisted that his children attend top private (and secular) schools such as Harvard. That left the nine Kennedy children\u2019s religious education to Rose, a devout Catholic.\n\n\u201cAt the time, it was the Irish Catholic ideal,\u201d Langan said, \u201ca big and active family where the father was successful in business and politics and the mother was the spiritual center, the person who held it all together.\u201d\n\nIn other ways, the Kennedys were anything but typical Irish Catholics, said Kean University historian Terry Golway. They were lucratively rich. They mingled with Boston Brahmins. They went to Harvard, not Holy Cross.\n\n\u201cSome people saw them as a faux Catholic,\u201d Golway said, \u201ctoo big for their britches.\u201d\n\nBut few historians doubt Rose Kennedy\u2019s devout attachment to Catholicism.\n\nShe attended the country\u2019s top Catholic schools, and she supervised her family like the nuns who ran those schools, according to biographer Barbara A. Perry.\n\nRose neither spared the rod nor tolerated emotional outbursts. Any bumps and bruises were to be \u201coffered up to God,\u201d the matriarch insisted, no complaining allowed.\n\n\u201cShe was terribly religious,\u201d John Kennedy said as an adult. \u201cShe was a little removed.\u201d\n\nStill, many say the stoicism Rose Kennedy instilled helped her son deal with the debilitating health issues that plagued his short life. Other historians theorize that Kennedy's poor health - he was twice given last rites before recovering - played a role in his wanton womanizing.\n\n\u201cHis continual, almost heroic sexual performance,\u201d wrote Catholic scholar Garry Wills, was a \u201ccackling at the gods of disability that plagued him.\u201d\n\nWell before her son's playboy days, Rose neatly noted her children\u2019s medical histories and church milestones such as baptism, confirmation and first Holy Communion on small index cards.\n\nShe left rosaries on their beds, tested their knowledge of the Catholic Catechism and oversaw their prayers for hints of apostasy.\n\nRose regularly took the children on walks to the local parish or the zoo, where she would show them the lions and explain how they once devoured faithful Christians. It was an effective, if morbid, method to hold the children\u2019s interest, Perry notes in her book \u201cRose Kennedy: The Life and Times of a Political Matriarch.\"\n\nAs the Kennedy kids grew up, Rose pinned questions about priests\u2019 sermons and Holy Days on the family blackboard, expecting the children to discuss them at dinner, according to Perry.\n\nThe matriarch continued preaching the faith well into her children's adulthood, advising them that praying the rosary was as good a way to relieve stress as any drink or pill, and a good bit better for their figure.\n\nAnd Rose wrote to Jacqueline Kennedy to \u201cremind Jack about his Easter duty\u201d to attend the sacrament of confession. \u201cI\u2019m sure that the church is quite near\u201d to their home in Washington, she nagged.\n\nTeasing and testing\n\nSurrounded by his mother\u2019s intense piety, Jack Kennedy couldn\u2019t help but tease and test her.\n\nHe interrupted her Bible stories to ask odd questions such as what happened to the donkey Jesus rode into Jerusalem on Palm Sunday? Who took care of the ass after the crucifixion?\n\nLater, Kennedy\u2019s questions grew more probing.\n\nTraveling through the Middle East as an adolescent, he visited Jerusalem, where Christians believe Christ ascended into heaven and Muslims believe the same about Mohammed.\n\nUpon his return to the United States, Kennedy promptly asked a priest, \u201cMohammed has a big following and Christ has a big following, and why do you think we should believe in Christ any more than Mohammed?\u201d\n\nGet this boy some religious instruction, before he becomes an atheist, the priest told Kennedy\u2019s parents, according to Dallek\u2019s biography.\n\nLater, Kennedy teasingly threatened to teach a Bible class - then a strictly Protestant practice - when his parents pressured him to dump his married girlfriend, Inga Arvad.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t good works come under our obligations to the Catholic Church?\u201d he needled his mother and father.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not a completely ritualistic, formalistic, hierarchical structure in which the Word, the truth, must only come down from the very top - a structure that allows for no individual interpretation - or are we?\u201d\n\nKennedy even ribbed Rose and Joe while fighting in the Solomon Islands during World War II. He told them he had dutifully attended Easter Mass at a native hut, even as enemy aircraft circled overhead. And his parents would be pleased to know a priest had devoted all his energies to Kennedy\u2019s salvation.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m stringing along with him,\u201d Kennedy wrote, \u201cbut I\u2019m not giving over too easy as I want him to work a bit - so he\u2019ll appreciate it more when he finally has me in the front row every morning screaming hallelujah.\u201d\n\nThe lion\u2019s den\n\nJoking aside, Kennedy took his faith seriously, according to several biographers, especially when it became a political issue.\n\nIn 1947, when Kennedy was a representative from Massachusetts, Congress held a hearing on public funding for parochial schools. He exploded when a Freemason testified that Catholics owe their loyalties to their church, not their country.\n\n\u201cI am not a legal subject of the Pope,\u201d Kennedy countered. \u201cThere is an old saying in Boston that we get our religion from Rome and our politics from home.\u201d\n\nThe congressional contretemps was just a prelude to the prejudice Kennedy endured during his 1960 presidential run.\n\nProtestant leaders - from backwoods evangelists and radio preachers to prominent pastors such as Billy Graham and Norman Vincent Peale - warned the country would go to hell with a Catholic in the Oval Office.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m getting tired of these people who think I want to replace the gold at Fort Knox with a supply of holy water,\u201d Kennedy complained.\n\nAgainst some advisers\u2019 counsel, the candidate decided to directly confront the anti-Catholic bias with a televised speech to a group of Protestant ministers in Houston in 1960. It was like Daniel walking into the lion\u2019s den, a journalist said at the time.\n\nIn the now famous speech, Kennedy said he believed that America\u2019s separation of church and state is \u201cabsolute\u201d and that a presidential candidate\u2019s religious beliefs are \u201chis own private affair.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not speak for my church on public matters, and the church does not speak for me,\u201d Kennedy said.\n\nThe Protestant ministers pressed Kennedy on those pledges in a question and answer session that followed, according to Dallek, but the candidate\u2019s calm reassurances seemed to win many of them over.\n\n\u201cHe responded with such poise and restraint that the ministers stood and applauded at the close of the meeting, and some came forward to shake his hand and wish him well in the campaign.\u201d\n\nA \u2018little less convinced\u2019\n\nAs president, Kennedy continued to say his daily prayers, morning and night, his sister Eunice told historians. But \u201cthat doesn\u2019t mean he was terribly religious,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cHe was always a little less convinced\u201d than the rest of the Kennedy clan, Eunice continued, especially his brother Robert Kennedy, who took after Rose.\n\nStill, Eunice said John always hustled off to Mass on Sundays, even while traveling. Maier, the Kennedy biographer who called him Mr. Saturday Night and Mr. Sunday Morning, said The New York Times\u2019 index of the president\u2019s travels show him faithfully attending Mass once a week, wherever he happened to be.\n\n\u201cThe popular perception is that he wasn\u2019t all that religious,\u201d Maier said, \u201cbut by today\u2019s standards he would be called a traditional Catholic.\u201d\n\nDallek said he believes Kennedy attended religious rituals more out of duty than desire. \u201cThis is the faith he was reared in, and something his parents expected him to do,\u201d the historian said.\n\n\u201cAs president it was kind of mandatory to go to church, to show that he was a man of good Christian faith. But was it something that informed his daily life and decisions as president? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d\n\nOthers, however, see echoes of Kennedy\u2019s Catholic upbringing in his most famous speech, the 1961 inaugural address. In it, the new president urged Americans to \u201cask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe words chosen seem to spring from a sacramental background,\u201d the Rev. Daniel Coughlin, first Catholic chaplain in the U.S. House of Representatives, wrote in a recent blog post.\n\n\u201cIn fact, the whole speech was framed by his belief in a living and ever-present God both at its beginning and in the end,\u201d Coughlin wrote.\n\nTwo months later, in a move that may have harkened back to meeting the Catholic missionary, Kennedy founded the Peace Corps.\n\nA monk predicts the assassination\n\nRegardless of how faithful Kennedy was, Irish Catholicism is as much a culture as a set of religious rules and rituals, said Peter Quinn, author of \u201cLooking for Jimmy: A Search for Irish America.\u201d\n\nKennedy\u2019s gift for gab and love of language; his fierce loyalty and clannishness; his temper and his wit; his concern for the poor and sense of the tragedy of life - he lost a beloved brother and sister at a young age - all are hallmarks of Irish Catholicism, Quinn said.\n\n\u201cThe church was the building block of Irish identity, and Kennedy was imbued in that culture.\u201d\n\nGolway agrees. \u201cThere was a chip on his shoulder, a sense of being embattled and having to fight for everything. That\u2019s a very Irish-Catholic thing.\u201d\n\nOther historians believe Kennedy was becoming more religious, in the traditional sense, as the threat of nuclear war loomed over his presidency.\n\n\u201cHe never talked about his religion, never,\u201d said James W. Douglass, author of \u201cJFK and the Unspeakable: Why He Died and Why it Matters.\u201d \u201cBut at great personal risk, he was turning from war toward peacemaking.\u201d\n\nKennedy would not have been the first president to \u201cget religion\u201d in the Oval Office.\n\nLincoln, an unorthodox believer, once said that \u201cI have been driven many times upon my knees by the overwhelming conviction that I had no where else to go.\u201d\n\nHistorians say Kennedy kept a note on his desk paraphrasing another quote from Lincoln, \u201cI know that there is a God and I see a storm coming. ... If he has a place for me, I am ready.\u201d\n\nIf Lincoln\u2019s storm was the Civil War, Kennedy\u2019s was the Cold War.\n\nAs Douglass notes, some Catholics had little confidence that Kennedy, the youngest elected president in American history, had the wisdom and humanity to carry the country through the existential threat.\n\n\u201cMaybe Kennedy will break through into that some day by miracle,\u201d Thomas Merton, the American Trappist monk and author, wrote to a friend.\n\n\u201cBut such people are before long marked out for assassination.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "By\u00a0Daniel Burke, Belief Blog Co-editor (CNN) -- When John F.
