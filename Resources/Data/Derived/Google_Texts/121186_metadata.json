The recent presidential order is an important step toward temporarily alleviating that tragedy. Next, however, permanent, bipartisan legislation that finally addresses all aspects of our broken system must be made a priority in 2015.\n\nThe recent orders will expand temporary protections given in June 2012 to approximately 1 million DREAMers \u2014 children brought to the United States, often as infants or toddlers, who have grown up here and have become American in all senses except their immigration status. These children and young adults are an essential part of America\u2019s and Minnesota\u2019s future.\n\nProtection from deportation and a government-issued work authorization card will be provided to two main groups of people for three years, if they have a clean record, pay all fees and can prove they have been in the United States since before Jan. 1, 2010:\n\n\u2022 Four million individuals who are parents of a U.S. citizen or a legal permanent resident child.\n\n\u2022 300,000 additional DREAMers who were excluded in 2012 because they were older than 30 or had arrived after 2007.\n\nThis action is based on well-established history of prosecutorial discretion to define priorities (and nonpriorities) for deportation. It is another important step to protect U.S.-born children whose parent or parents are among the 11.5 million living in this country without status. Today, the average length of time an undocumented person has lived in the United States is an amazing 13 years.\n\nWe acknowledge that good people have constitutional concerns. That issue will be addressed in any future litigation.\n\nThe orders protect the integrity of families and prioritize our limited enforcement focus on known threats. They will also stabilize the futures of millions of U.S.-born children whose futures depend on their parents and on how we as a country ultimately decide to treat their families.\n\nThose who qualify will have to affirmatively apply to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to receive a three-year work authorization card; obtain a Social Security card; pay past taxes; pay a fee; pass multiple security and background checks, and provide clear evidence of at least five years of continuous residence in the United States. A birth certificate must be submitted for a qualifying child.\n\nQualifying will not lead to a green card nor make one eligible for public benefits or any subsidies under the Affordable Care Act or MNsure.\n\nMinnesota and other states should provide eligibility for a driver\u2019s license for qualifiers. The ability to work and drive and not be threatened with deportation are basic protections. But from a family\u2019s perspective, nothing could touch the bedrock of the most important security \u2014 the assurance to a child that her mom and dad will not be deported, but rather that they will come home from work each day.\n\nThe answer is clear. We must continue to push Washington to provide legislation to fix our broken system. And we must make sure all those who are eligible for temporary protection receive the necessary legal assistance to qualify as soon as possible. We are grateful that Minnesota has a strong history of coming together to solve problems, often through the support of some of the nation\u2019s leading nonprofit organizations. Our state\u2019s largest provider of immigration legal and advocacy services for the low-income is the Immigrant Law Center of Minnesota (ILCM). Last year, it assisted over 4,500 immigrant clients from 98 countries. This statewide resource is uniquely trusted by immigrants from all over the world.\n\nThe ILCM, the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce, the AFL-CIO and SEIU, and representatives of major faith groups have formed a coalition that has worked for the last seven years to urge Washington to make permanent changes to our broken immigration system. The members come together to act for reasons of justice, economic prosperity, compassion and family unity. With increased support from all Minnesotans, all of us will continue to move forward on permanent immigration legislation, while strengthening and empowering Minnesota\u2019s future and thousands of new Minnesota families.\n\nGarrison Keillor\u2019s recent performance of an Ann Reed song inspires our resolve to support positive changes to our immigration system.
