Bobby Jindal (R) is fast becoming one of the most vocal enemies of the Common Core standards. A potential 2016 presidential candidate, Jindal slammed the controversial education initiative during a speech in Washington, D.C., Thursday, asserting that the standards were created by \u201cthe elite in D.C.,\u201d who \u201cthink they know better than we do.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat happens when we stop teaching American exceptionalism to our students?\u201d Jindal asked at a luncheon sponsored by the conservative American Principles Project. \u201cWhat happens when the American history they\u2019re taught is not the one you and I were taught but a history of grievances?\u201d\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nThe Washington Post reports that Jindal compared the Common Core to Obamacare, programs that have both been developed by elitist bureaucrats in Washington.\n\n\u201cLocal parents, local teachers, local leaders need to make these decisions,\u201d Jindal said during his address. \u201cIn our entire history as a country, we\u2019ve never allowed the federal government to make these decisions for us. Now is not the time to start.\u201d\n\nThough Jindal was a supporter of the Common Core in the initiative\u2019s early days, he eventually heard the voices of conservatives regarding the reform\u2019s encroachment by the federal government further into education \u2013 an area reserved by the Constitution for the states and local governments.\n\nAs time grows closer to the 2016 presidential primary, the Common Core standards have become a defining issue separating constitutional conservatives from mainstream establishment candidates who have the support of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n\nIn his own state, Jindal issued an executive order last week to protect parents and school districts from consequences if they choose to opt out of the Common Core-aligned PARCC assessment.\n\nJindal said the GOP needs to run a candidate who will champion a strong conservative platform, rather than simply settle for \u201cDemocratic-lite.\u201d\n\nNola.com observed that Jindal took aim at Republican leadership in Congress. \u201cIf the whole point of this election was simply to give John Boehner and Mitch McConnell nicer offices, let\u2019s give them back,\u201d Jindal said. \u201cWhat is the point of having a Republican Party if it\u2019s only going to become a second liberal party?\u201d\n\nJindal also urged Republicans in Washington to repeal and replace Obamacare, as they promised their conservative base.\n\n\u201cThat means all of it,\u201d he said. \u201cThat means you have to get rid of all the tax increases, you get rid of all the regulations, all the spending, all of it. And then you start anew and really truly do what Americans want, which is to drive down the cost of health care.\u201d\n\nJindal said that as he continues to consider a run for the presidency in 2016, he will propose conservative solutions to America\u2019s problems and won\u2019t be timid on social issues. The Louisiana governor said he will be clear that he is pro-life and a believer in marriage between one man and one woman.\n\n\u201cPeople may not agree with you 100 percent of the time but respect you for being honest 100 percent of time on what you believe in,\u201d Jindal said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A potential 2016 presidential candidate, Gov.
