But one thing is clear: He isn't running away from his support of Common Core, the education standards that now draw the hatred of conservatives across the country.\n\n\u201cWe should always look to improve our thinking based on the evidence,\u201d the Republican politician said Thursday morning at an education summit sponsored by the nonprofit he oversees, Foundation for Excellence in Education. \u201cThis is why the debate over the Common Core State Standards has been troubling.\u201d He added, \u201cIn my view, the rigor of the Common Core State Standards must be the new minimum in classrooms.\u201d\n\nWhile many think his last name could be his biggest liability, the former Florida governor's position on education could prove to be a double-edged sword. The right flank of his party has neared the point of equating \u201cCommon Core\u201d with \u201cObamacare,\u201d both depicted by conservatives as a federal intrusion into the daily lives of individuals. The standards have been ridiculed, with criticism that not even parents can figure out the complicated new method of teaching math.\n\nPhoto: Reuters\n\nBush\u2019s long-term work on education \u2013 including a litany of accomplishments while he was governor (from 199 t0 2007), some of which he highlighted Thursday \u2013 make for the perfect campaign argument. Florida saw performance increase dramatically thanks to the policies he put in place. And he started the pro-reform education foundation, whose annual summit he was speaking at Thursday.\n\nTalking about education is almost always a successful campaign strategy. It\u2019s simply one of the most basic concerns of millions of voters \u2013 will their children, or grandchildren, get the education they need to be successful. His brother, former President George W. Bush, talked about the education reforms he implemented while governor of Texas when he ran for president.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nAnd as Jeb Bush did in his speech today, talking about education can be easily parlayed into a number of other issues. How about the state of the United States in the world economy? Or talking about the U.S. and China relations? Bush touched on all of those in his education address.\n\n\u201cThis morning over 213 million Chinese students went to school, and nobody debated whether academic expectations should be lowered in order to protect the students' self-esteem,\u201d Bush said in defending Common Core. \u201cIn an international report card on education performance, students from Shanghai ranked number one. Students from the U.S. ranked 21st in reading and 31st in math.\u201d\n\nBut while every conservative will agree that the United States should be outperforming China, they aren\u2019t seeing Common Core as the path to get there. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, who is likely to run for president, has become one of the most outspoken opponents of Common Core, pulling his state from the standards and even suing the federal government over the standards.\n\nBush had some carefully crafted words for those who are abandoning the standards.\n\n\u201cFor those states choosing a path other than Common Core, I say this: Aim even higher, be bolder, raise standards and ask more of our students and the system,\u201d Bush said. \u201cBecause I know they have the potential to deliver it. Even if we don't all agree on Common Core, there are more important principles for us to agree on. We need to pull together whenever we can.\u201d\n\nCommon Core hasn\u2019t always been such a controversial issue.\n\nThe standards were crafted by bipartisan state government associations, including the National Governors Association. They were adopted by 44 states, including those that were run by Republicans at the time. The goal was to find a way to get national continuity and ensure a student who moved cross-country wouldn\u2019t be met with wildly different expectations.\n\nBut despite the lack of federal involvement at the start, President Barack Obama and his administration embraced the standards and incorporated them into their education grant program \u201cRace to the Top,\u201d which later led to a revolt from the right. Since then, two states have repealed the rules and others have changed their use of them.\n\nBush showed no signs of being concerned about that conservative backlash by sticking with Common Core.\n\n\u201cLet's do that work,\u201d Bush said. \u201cLet's be disruptive. But let us never lose sight of our greater goal: the future of learning in America. The future of an America where everyone has the opportunity to achieve their potential and earn success.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://s2.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "jeb bush common core, jeb bush education, jeb bush 2016, jeb bush common core 2016, republicans common core, conservatives common core, common core criticism, common core math, jeb bush presidential campaign, jeb bush liability, 2016 gop primary", "og": {"site_name": "International Business Times", "description": "Jeb Bush's biggest liability in a 2016 primary campaign could be his steady support of the education standards that anger conservatives.", "title": "Jeb Bush Common Core Support Could Cripple A Presidential Campaign", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.com/jeb-bush-common-core-support-could-cripple-presidential-campaign-1726895", "image": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2013/04/25/bush-jeb-2013.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Jeb Bush's biggest liability in a 2016 primary campaign could be his steady support of the education standards that anger conservatives.", "title": "Jeb Bush Common Core Support Could Cripple A Presidential Campaign", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.com/jeb-bush-common-core-support-could-cripple-presidential-campaign-1726895", "image": {"src": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2013/04/25/bush-jeb-2013.jpg", "identifier": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2013/04/25/bush-jeb-2013.jpg"}, "site": "@IBTimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "fb": {"app_id": 263851690471857, "pages": 128026713884051}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/IBTimes", "section": "National", "published_time": "2014-11-20T10:42:01-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-07T00:32:16-05:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/reporterginger"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Jeb Bush's biggest liability in a 2016 primary campaign could be his steady support of the education standards that anger conservatives."}, "article_summary": "Even if we don't all agree on Common Core, there are more important principles for us to agree on.\nBut one thing is clear: He isn't running away from his support of Common Core, the education standards that now draw the hatred of conservatives across the country.\nBush showed no signs of being concerned about that conservative backlash by sticking with Common Core.\nThe right flank of his party has neared the point of equating \u201cCommon Core\u201d with \u201cObamacare,\u201d both depicted by conservatives as a federal intrusion into the daily lives of individuals.\nThey were adopted by 44 states, including those that were run by Republicans at the time."}
