The panel all responded affirmatively.\n\nDuring prior discussion, panelists including Chris Ferrell had condemned what they described as the Benghazi cover-up, which included a role played by speaker John Boehner is thwarting a select committee.\n\nThomas has come under fire before for conservative political activism. Thomas is a columnist for the Daily Caller , a consultant to tea party groups, a lobbyist, and co-founder of conservative group Groundswell that plans a \"30-front war seeking to fundamentally transform the nation.\"\n\nOutside the room, Thomas expressed her enthusiasm about a select committee to investigate Benghazi and hoped it would happen soon. However, she declined to expand on her comments for The Daily Beast, insisting \u201cI don\u2019t do interviews\u201d and \u201cI have to get lunch.\u201d\n\nThomas asked her question at an open press event that was being webcast.\n\nCorrection: In an earlier version of this story, Ginni Thomas was mistakenly referred to as a registered lobbyist. While the tea party activist did lobby at least 50 members of Congress, she never registered as a lobbyist. Thomas has also led a group called Liberty Central, which has devoted itself to fighting the \"tyranny\" of Barack Obama, specifically on matters that have been under deliberation at the Supreme Court like campaign finance reform and the Affordable Care Act.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "bencjacobs"}, "keywords": "Clarence Thomas, United States Supreme Court, u.s. poli, CPAC, Libya", "publicationDate": 201403061800, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "news_keywords": "Clarence Thomas, United States Supreme Court, US Politics, CPAC, Libya", "pageNum": 1, "title": "Clarence Thomass Wife Asks If Obama Administration Provided Material Support to Terrorists", "tags": "entity:person/clarence_thomas,entity:organization/united_states_supreme_court,topic:politics,entity:politicalevent/cpac,entity:country/libya", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "Ginni Thomas wants to know if the White House committed any crimes at a panel on \u201cBenghazigate.\u201d", "title": "Clarence Thomas\u2019s Wife Asks If Obama Administration Provided Material Support to Terrorists", "url": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/03/06/clarence-thomas-s-wife-asks-if-obama-administration-provided-material-support-to-terrorists.html", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/03/06/clarence-thomas-s-wife-asks-if-obama-administration-provided-material-support-to-terrorists/jcr:content/image.img.2000.jpg/1394135301402.cached.jpg", "type": "article"}, "environment": "dev", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "type": "house", "description": "Ginni Thomas wants to know if the White House committed any crimes at a panel on \u201cBenghazigate.\u201d", "sectionTaxanomies": "politics", "fb": {"admins": "1703087,30000737,1117577220,1276800108,931159,514915512", "app_id": 189930913679}, "authors": "Ben Jacobs", "article": {"section": "politics", "published_time": "2014-03-06T18:00:00.000Z", "author": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/ben-jacobshtml"}, "resourceType": "dailybeast2/components/pages/article", "contentpath": "/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/03/06/clarence-thomas-s-wife-asks-if-obama-administration-provided-material-support-to-terrorists", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Clarence Thomas\u2019s Wife Asks If Obama Administration Provided Material Support to Terrorists\",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/03/06/clarence-thomas-s-wife-asks-if-obama-administration-provided-material-support-to-terrorists.html\",\"image_url\":\"http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/03/06/clarence-thomas-s-wife-asks-if-obama-administration-provided-material-support-to-terrorists/jcr:content/image.crop.410.273.jpg/46471176.cached.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/03/06/clarence-thomas-s-wife-asks-if-obama-administration-provided-material-support-to-terrorists\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-03-06T18:00:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"Politics\",\"author\":\"Ben Jacobs\",\"tags\":[\"clarence_thomas\",\"united_states_supreme_court\",\"politics\",\"cpac\",\"libya\"]}", "authorIds": "/etc/authors/b/ben-jacobs", "content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2d6c\"", "article_summary": "The wife of a sitting Supreme Court Justice wants to know if the Obama administration has provided material support to terrorists.\nWhile the tea party activist did lobby at least 50 members of Congress, she never registered as a lobbyist.\nOutside the room, Thomas expressed her enthusiasm about a select committee to investigate Benghazi and hoped it would happen soon.\nCorrection: In an earlier version of this story, Ginni Thomas was mistakenly referred to as a registered lobbyist.\nAt a panel on \u201cBenghazigate: The Ugly Truth and Coverup\u201d held by a rival conservative conference to CPAC, Ginni Thomas, a conservative activist and wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, asked a panel that included controversial retired General Jerry Boykin if the Obama administration had committed any crimes, in particular, providing material support to terrorists."}
