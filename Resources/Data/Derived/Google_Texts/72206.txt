Arbitration and mediation have become major forums for healthcare business disputes, which extend far beyond traditional medical issues between patients and providers. Major claims involving contractual issues between providers and business associates are taking center stage in the healthcare ADR arena. Many of these disputes require the use or disclosure of protected healthcare information (PHI) as defined by HIPAA. The use of PHI is governed by the HIPAA privacy rules.

Organizations and individuals required to comply with the HIPAA privacy rules are called covered entities. Covered entities include health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and any healthcare provider that transmits health information in electronic form in connection with transactions for which the secretary of Health and Human Services has adopted standards under HIPAA.
