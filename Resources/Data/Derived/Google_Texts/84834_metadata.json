Most of the documents the agency sells can now be accessed online for free, thanks to a handy invention called the Internet \u2013 which, to be fair to the NTIS, wasn\u2019t around when the agency was created in the 1950s.\n\nNow, lawmakers say it\u2019s time for NTIS to go since its entire mission is obsolete.\n\nThe push to eliminate NTIS first began last year when the Government Accountability Office reported that more than 75 percent of the agency\u2019s documents were available on the Internet in 2012. That figure has almost certainly increased.\n\nThe GAO\u2019s findings prompted former Sen. Tom Coburn (R-OK) and Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-MO) to introduce a bill \u2013 aptly named the \u201cLet Me Google That For You\u201d Act \u2013 that proposed doing away with the entire agency.\n\nRelated: Your Taxes Are Still Paying for This?\n\nDuring a hearing last summer, Coburn didn\u2019t mince words to NTIS director Bruce Borzino: The goal, said Coburn, is to \u201celiminate you as an agency.\u201d\n\nThat movement didn\u2019t exactly catch fire on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers were dubbed the least productive Congress in history last year. Coburn retired and NTIS is still standing.\n\nNow McCaskill is making another attempt at shutting it down. On Wednesday, the senator from Missouri reintroduced the \u201cLet Me Google That for You\u201d Act, pledging that closing the agency would save the federal government over $50 million a year.\n\nNTIS, for its part, says it helps \u201cpromote American innovation and economic growth by collecting and disseminating scientific, technical and engineering information to the public and industry, by providing information management solutions to other federal agencies.\u201d That\u2019s according to its mission statement.\n\nRelated: How Many Agencies Does It Take to Change a Lightbulb?\n\nYet a report from GAO found the agency has only sold 8 percent of its documents between 1990 through 2011 \u2013 losing more than $1.3 million a year in operating costs.\n\nSo far, the bill has received bipartisan support, though it\u2019s unclear how much traction it will get by the ever-gridlocked Congress.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Lawmakers are once again trying to close a tiny obscure agency that serves virtually n", "title": "Why We Can\u2019t Kill a Useless Government Agency", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/19/Why-We-Can-t-Kill-Useless-Government-Agency", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/10302013_Computer_Problem.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/19/Why-We-Can-t-Kill-Useless-Government-Agency", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/10302013_Computer_Problem.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@Briannaehley"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Lawmakers are once again trying to close a tiny obscure agency that serves virtually n", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd01e9\"", "article_summary": "The entire purpose of the National Technical Information Services agency (NTIS) is to compile and sell government documents and scientific research papers to other federal agencies and the private sector.\nRelated: GAO Asks Agency to Stop Selling Its Free ReportsThere\u2019s one big problem.\nLawmakers are once again trying to close a tiny obscure agency that serves virtually no purpose other than racking up an unnecessary multimillion-dollar tab for taxpayers.\nThe GAO\u2019s findings prompted former Sen.
