Oil money runs Alaska. Residents don’t pay sales tax and the state income tax was abolished in 1980, after the completion of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline. Each year, Alaskans receive a check based on earned interest from the Alaska Permanent Fund, which invests pooled oil and mineral royalties. (Last year’s disbursement was a record high of $2,072 per person.)

It’s a formula that has served the state well for many years, but with oil prices tanking, the state is now grappling with a multibillion-dollar deficit in its budget, prompting calls for sweeping changes in how the government is funded. Petroleum revenues plunged to a 21.3 percent share of the state general fund in the last fiscal year — down from 48.0 percent just one year prior, and 59.6 percent the year before that. The general fund itself has dwindled over the same interval, falling from $10.3 billion in 2013 to just under $4.9 billion in 2015.

Alaska’s plight is not unique. Western states — particularly Alaska, North Dakota and Wyoming — are among those most reliant on extractive industries, and are thus the hardest hit by recent crashes in the price of oil, coal and natural gas. In Wyoming, for instance, extractive industries accounted for over a third of the state’s GDP in 2013 — the highest proportion in the nation.

That dependence on boom-and-bust industries makes for a lot of economic uncertainty. A Pew analysis showed that Alaska, North Dakota and Wyoming have three of the four highest levels of tax revenue volatility in the nation. Other Western states like California, Colorado (at No. 12), Arizona and New Mexico hold many of the top spots, due to a variety of factors not limited to severance taxes.
