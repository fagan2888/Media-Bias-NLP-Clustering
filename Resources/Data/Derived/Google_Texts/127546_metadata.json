Bush administrations and served on the staffs of Representatives Jack Kemp and Ron Paul. He is the author of \u201cThe Benefit and the Burden: Tax Reform \u2014 Why We Need It and What It Will Take.\u201d\n\nThirty years ago this week, Ronald Reagan set in motion the process that eventually led to passage of the Tax Reform Act of 1986. Since many people believe that a similar tax reform is long overdue, it\u2019s important to understand why the Reagan effort worked and why similar conditions do not yet exist today.\n\nIn his State of the Union Address on Jan. 25, 1984, Reagan said:\n\nLet us go forward with an historic reform for fairness, simplicity and incentives for growth. I am asking Secretary Don Regan for a plan for action to simplify the entire tax code, so all taxpayers, big and small, are treated more fairly. And I believe such a plan could result in that underground economy being brought into the sunlight of honest tax compliance. And it could make the tax base broader, so personal tax rates could come down, not go up. I\u2019ve asked that specific recommendations, consistent with those objectives, be presented to me by December 1984.\n\nToday's Economist Perspectives from expert contributors.\n\nThere was some laughter in the House chamber when Reagan said \u201cDecember 1984\u201d because it was after the election. Everyone knew that tax reform is one of those issues that is perennially popular in theory but not so much in practice.\n\nThe core problem is one that is confronted frequently in politics \u2014 the benefits of some objective are widely diffused, but the costs are concentrated. Those that bear the concentrated costs, whether from loophole closings or government spending cuts, have a powerful incentive to lobby against those changes, while those that benefit from a reduction in tax rates or the deficit don\u2019t benefit enough to necessarily create a countervailing political force. This is especially so when the ox being gored is a well-organized industry group.\n\n\n\nThe reason tax reform worked in the 1980s is the ground had been well-plowed for the previous 20 years by those on both the right and left. It began with John F. Kennedy\u2019s message to Congress on Jan. 24, 1963, in which he asked for a number of tax reforms along with a reduction in tax rates.\n\nSubsequently, Congress dropped all the reforms and enacted only the rate reductions. Among those dismayed by Congress\u2019s cavalier dismissal of tax reform was Stanley S. Surrey, the Treasury Department\u2019s assistant secretary for tax policy. Mr. Surrey had been a professor of law at Harvard and was a longtime advocate of tax reform.\n\nMr. Surrey, who remained in his position through the Lyndon B. Johnson administration, thought one reason for Congress\u2019s attitude was that it had no idea how many tax loopholes there were or how much revenue they were costing the Treasury. Many of these loopholes had been forgotten by members of the House Ways and Means Committee and Senate Finance Committee and were known only to tax specialists. Unlike appropriations, which are reviewed annually, there was little if any oversight of tax loopholes.\n\nThe Treasury staff was tasked with compiling, for the first time, a complete list of tax loopholes and figuring out their revenue cost. In a 1967 speech, Mr. Surrey referred to them as \u201ctax expenditures\u201d to show that there was essentially no difference between a special tax deal and a direct spending program accomplishing the same purpose.\n\nThe Treasury tax expenditures list was finally released by Treasury Secretary Joseph W. Barr in January 1969, just days before he would leave office as Richard Nixon became president. He revealed that tax expenditures cost the Treasury $50 billion per year when total federal revenues were just $150 billion. Mr. Barr also disclosed that in 1967, 155 Americans with adjusted gross incomes of more than $200,000 \u2014 about $1.4 million today \u2013 paid no federal income taxes, legally, by using tax loopholes; 21 of them had incomes of more than $1 million, about $7 million today.\n\nIn those days, Mr. Barr\u2019s revelations constituted a scandal that led Congress to enact the Tax Reform Act of 1969, which, among other things, instituted a minimum tax to prevent the wealthy from legally avoiding income taxes altogether. Although the alternative minimum tax is still on the books, the number of high-income individuals with no income tax liability is vastly higher today. In 2010, there were 19,000 tax filers with at least $200,000 of adjusted gross income who legally avoided any federal income tax liability, according to the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nIn 1974, Congress required the Treasury Department to prepare an annual tax expenditures list that is published in the budget. In 1976, it enacted another bill to further close tax loopholes. Jimmy Carter sent yet another tax reform bill to Congress in 1978, but it had lost interest in the subject; by then, tax reform simply meant increasing taxes and Congress was becoming increasingly interested only in tax cuts.\n\nAfter passage of Proposition 13 in California on June 6, 1978, even Democrats began pushing pro-growth tax cuts, such as a cut in the capital gains tax, which had been raised in the 1969 tax reform. The 1978 legislation restored the pre-1969 tax treatment of capital gains, reducing the maximum rate to 28 percent from 35 percent. President Carter threatened a veto because of this, but nevertheless signed the legislation on Nov. 6, 1978.\n\nThe fundamental reason for the decline of tax reform in the late 1970s was one thing: inflation. It raised the nominal incomes of many families solidly in the middle of the income distribution to levels that, in dollar terms, made them very well to do \u2014 and they were taxed as such.\n\nBy 1978, a family of four with the median income made $20,428 \u2014 more than a family with twice the median income had made a decade earlier. According to the Tax Policy Center, between 1965 and 1978, the average federal income tax rate on the median family rose four percentage points to 11.1 percent from 7.1 percent, an increase of 56 percent. Its marginal rate \u2014 the tax on each additional dollar earned \u2014 rose to 25 percent from 17 percent.\n\nThis made average people receptive to tax policies that would have benefited only the rich just a few years earlier.\n\nNext week I will continue the story of how the Tax Reform Act of 1986 came to be.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20140121000104, "BN": "economix", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "businessday/economix", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/economix/post", "per": "Barr, Joseph W;Carter, Jimmy;Kennedy, John Fitzgerald;Reagan, Ronald Wilson", "article": {"section": "Business Day", "tag": "_featured", "published_time": 1390280464, "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/business/index.jsonp", "modified_time": "2014-01-21T05:01:04-05:00"}, "keywords": "Barr Joseph W,Carter Jimmy,Kennedy John Fitzgerald,Reagan Ronald Wilson,Capital Gains Tax,Federal Taxes (US),Income Tax,House of Representatives,Internal Revenue Service,Tax Expenditures,Today's Economist,Uncategorized,_featured", "GBLC": "Tax Expenditures;Today's Economist", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/economix/The Roots of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, Part I ( 20140121 )", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Bruce Bartlett", "SCG": "Economy", "sourceApp": "blogs", "CLMST": "Bruce Bartlett", "byl": "Bruce Bartlett", "twitter": {"description": "Tax reform is long overdue, and lessons on how to go about it can be learned from the Tax Reform Act of 1986, an economist writes.", "title": "The Roots of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, Part I", "url": "http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/21/the-roots-of-the-tax-reform-act-of-1986-part-i/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "site": "@nyteconomix", "card": "summary"}, "blogpostid": 100000002661686, "description": "Tax reform is long overdue, and lessons on how to go about it can be learned from the Tax Reform Act of 1986, an economist writes.", "CG": "Business Day", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "January 21, 2014", "org": "House of Representatives;Internal Revenue Service", "utime": 20140121050104, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20140121, "pdate": 20140121, "des": "Capital Gains Tax;Federal Taxes (US);Income Tax", "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "Economix Blog", "description": "Tax reform is long overdue, and lessons on how to go about it can be learned from the Tax Reform Act of 1986, an economist writes.", "title": "The Roots of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, Part I", "url": "http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/21/the-roots-of-the-tax-reform-act-of-1986-part-i/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/21/the-roots-of-the-tax-reform-act-of-1986-part-i/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "The Roots of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, Part I", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post", "DISPLAYDATE": "January 21, 2014"}, "article_summary": "Next week I will continue the story of how the Tax Reform Act of 1986 came to be.\nHe is the author of \u201cThe Benefit and the Burden: Tax Reform \u2014 Why We Need It and What It Will Take.\u201dThirty years ago this week, Ronald Reagan set in motion the process that eventually led to passage of the Tax Reform Act of 1986.\nJimmy Carter sent yet another tax reform bill to Congress in 1978, but it had lost interest in the subject; by then, tax reform simply meant increasing taxes and Congress was becoming increasingly interested only in tax cuts.\nEveryone knew that tax reform is one of those issues that is perennially popular in theory but not so much in practice.\nAmong those dismayed by Congress\u2019s cavalier dismissal of tax reform was Stanley S.
