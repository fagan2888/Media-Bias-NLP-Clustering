LONDON (AP) — Leicester’s first target was exceeded long ago: Premier League survival. Another landmark was achieved Sunday: Champions League qualification for the first time. By the end of the month, Leicester should have secured the prize once simply unthinkable for such a team: the Premier League trophy itself.

Jamie Vardy’s double at Sunderland sealed a 2-0 victory that guaranteed a coveted top-four finish. Leicester remains seven points clear at the top and is starting to resemble a Premier League thoroughbred with its effortless march to a first title.

This isn’t what a title run-in should look like for a team yet to win the league title in its 132-year history and was in a relegation scrap this time last season.

Tottenham is waiting to pounce on any slip-up by Leicester. The second-place London club responded to Leicester’s Sunderland success by ending a 15-year wait for a home win over Manchester United. A 3-0 victory was secured by Dele Alli, Toby Alderweireld and Erik Lamela scoring within five minutes, 46 seconds in the second half.

It pushed Tottenham a step closer to joining Leicester in the Champions League next season, having only featured in Europe’s top competition once before.

United looks unlikely to be with them, given that crosstown rival Manchester City is four points ahead in fourth place.

As things are progressing, record 20-time English champion United could see Leicester guarantee the title by winning at Old Trafford in three games time.
