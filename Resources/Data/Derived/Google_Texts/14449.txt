NATURAL ROUGH CUT (NO REPORTER NARRATION) Britain's Duke and Duchess of Cambridge trekked on Friday (April 15) to a Buddhist monastery on a mountainside in Bhutan, going one better than Prince Charles who on a 1998 trip broke off his hike to paint a watercolour. Prince William and wife Kate dressed down for the three-hour expedition to the so-called Tiger's Nest perched on a mountainside at 3,000 metres (10,000 feet). The couple stopped along the way to smile for the cameras before the backdrop of the 17th century Taktsang Palphug Monastery across the Paro valley. Porters were on hand, including one with an oxygen cylinder, but the couple managed without difficulty. They were welcomed to Bhutan on Thursday (April 14) by the young - and equally glamorous - king and queen of the tiny Himalayan nation. On Saturday (April 16), they return to India to visit the Taj Mahal, which was built in 1632 by Moghul Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his favourite wife. William's mother, the late Princess Diana, visited in 1992 and was memorably photographed sitting alone on a bench on front of the marble mausoleum, in an image that came to symbolise her unhappy marriage.
