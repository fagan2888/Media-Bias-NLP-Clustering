Tim Walz came back to Mankato, MN yesterday to meet and greet constituents at South Central College, along with Rep. Collin Peterson. The three Democrats addressed an agricultural symposium, where Peterson talked at length about the farm bill. But KEYC\u2019s Ryan Gustafson captured a priceless moment when one attendee wanted to know why Democrats promised that ObamaCare would save families $2500 a year in premiums:\n\nKEYC \u2013 Mankato News, Weather, Sports \u2013\n\nThe lawmakers fielded other questions as well, talking debt and immigration reform, but it was the question about the struggling health care law that everyone in the audience wanted to see answered, and two out of the three Democrats on the dais seemed hesitant to tackle. The question: \u201cI thought the Affordable Care Act would save $2500 per family. What happened?\u201d After Sen. Klobuchar and Rep. Walz looked at each other, laughter broke out in the room. Rep. Peterson quickly picked up the microphone to say, \u201cI voted \u2018no\u2019, so I\u2019ll let these guys handle that,\u201d to the applause of the crowd.\n\nWalz then tried out the line that Democrats will use in their defense in the midterms:\n\nWalz says, \u201cThis health discussion has got to be broader, it\u2019s got to point out where there are weaknesses and failures, it\u2019s got to make sure we\u2019re not leaving people behind or distorting the system. But don\u2019t pretend there was some type of safe harbor before this where everything was just peachy keen.\u201d\n\nReally? We can test this thesis. Before the passage of ObamaCare, we have polling from Gallup about the status of satisfaction with health care in the US. In September 2009, 85% of Americans had health insurance \u2014 and 87% expressed satisfaction with their health care, while 61% were satisfied with the costs associated with it. Fifty percent of the uninsured were satisfied with their health care, although 69% were dissatisfied with the costs. The system worked for the overwhelming majority of Americans until Democrats decided that they knew better than doctors and insurers how to remake the market.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "\u201cWhat happened?\u201d", "title": "Video: \u201cI thought the Affordable Care Act would save $2500 per family?\u201d", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/02/20/video-i-thought-the-affordable-care-act-would-save-2500-per-family/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "keywords": "Amy Klobuchar, Collin Peterson, Minnesota, ObamaCare, premiums, Tim Walz,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-20T13:01:51+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-02-20T15:07:17+00:00"}, "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd931b\"", "article_summary": "The question: \u201cI thought the Affordable Care Act would save $2500 per family.\nBefore the passage of ObamaCare, we have polling from Gallup about the status of satisfaction with health care in the US.\nFifty percent of the uninsured were satisfied with their health care, although 69% were dissatisfied with the costs.\nWhat happened?\u201d After Sen.
