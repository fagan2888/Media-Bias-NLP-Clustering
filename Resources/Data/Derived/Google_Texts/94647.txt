The trailer for the next installment in the Fast and the Furious series has been released — and it's glorious.

Furious 7 is bringing back its cadre of stars, including Paul Walker, whose part needed to be reworked after his tragic death last year, with the addition of Jason Statham as a murderous villain. Nathalie Emmanuel, who you may recognize as Missandei from Game of Thrones, is in the mix as well.

The trailer features the kind of over-the-top stunts you'd expect as well as a few subtle nods to Walker's role. "One last ride," Vin Diesel's character says as the camera cuts to Walker's face.

Take a look:

It should be no surprise that a film series that went from standard street races to city-destroying bank heists and highway tank battles is trying to up the ante again. This time, the crew drives their cars out of a cargo plane. (Don't worry. The cars have parachutes.)

While we don't learn much of the plot outside of general themes of "vengeance" and "family," it's the little things — Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson breaking his arm out of a cast, Michelle Rodriguez saving Paul Walker's life with her car's spoiler, Vin Diesel doing everything Vin Diesel does — that make this one look just as exciting as the past few.

The tribute: Walker's untimely death left some scenes unfinished, and the filmmakers decided to round it out with the use of CGI and his brothers as stand-ins. The release of the trailer sparked some emotional responses from his costars.

"Very emotional seeing Paul on screen, yet beautiful at the same time," Johnson posted on his Facebook page. "I miss brother Paul. We all do…"
