Our business got turned upside down with Uber and Lyft,\u201d Campolongo said.\n\nThe service will be similar to the popular Lyft and Uber services, including what Campolongo said are safety upgrades.\n\nPart-time drivers using their cars will drive for the service, which would allow users to hail rides via the zTrip smartphone application. Drivers will have a computer tablet with a meter to record fares. Users can pay with credit card or cash.\n\nCampolongo said Yellow Z drivers must go through driver training, and their cars must pass a mechanic\u2019s inspection.\n\nFor riders seeking a more luxurious ride similar to the Uber Black service option, users can book a black Chrysler 300, Campolongo said.\n\n\u201c(Yellow Z drivers) will go out during peak times. They will get the overflow of cab calls,\u201d Campolongo said. \u201cThe nice thing is now we can expand (service) on weekends.\u201d\n\nRegular taxis will be available through the app, Campolongo said.\n\nPUC spokeswoman Denise McCracken said the agency approved Yellow Z months ago. Commissioners gave tentative approval to Lyft and Uber, but are awaiting compliance filings from the companies to satisfy insurance and safety requirements.\n\nA spokesman for Uber declined comment. A Lyft spokeswoman did not return a message seeking comment.\n\nA bill in the state Legislature could preempt PUC rules. The latest session ended with no action on the measure Sen. Wayne Fontana, D-Allegheny, introduced to outline ride-share service regulations. Fontana said he\u2019ll try again in 2015.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re working through the issues. We want to make the legislation all-inclusive. The insurance companies are also working through it,\u201d Fontana said. \u201cI would hope something gets done by June. We need the public to feel safe.\u201d\n\nSeveral taxi companies opposed the PUC\u2019s decision to approve operating permits for Lyft and Uber, saying the companies have an unfair advantage because they don\u2019t follow the same PUC regulations. The controversy erupted nearly a year ago here when the San Francisco-based companies began service in Pittsburgh.\n\nLyft and Uber officials contend their insurance and safety standards are adequate, and that they improve service.\n\n___\n\nOnline:\n\nhttp://bit.ly/13ODD6C\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, http://pghtrib.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Pittsburgh's Yellow Cab is poised to start a ride-sharing service dubbed Yellow Z that will help its drivers compete with established smartphone-based transportation firms Lyft and Uber from behind the wheel of their cars.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jan/3/cab-company-creates-app-to-compete-with-uber-lyft/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "Pittsburgh\u2019s Yellow Cab is poised to start a ride-sharing service dubbed Yellow Z that will help its drivers compete with established smartphone-based transportation firms Lyft and Uber from behind the wheel of their cars.", "title": "Cab company creates app to compete with Uber, Lyft"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "description": "Pittsburgh's Yellow Cab is poised to start a ride-sharing service dubbed Yellow Z that will help its drivers compete with established smartphone-based transportation firms Lyft and Uber from behind th", "card": "summary", "title": "Cab company creates app to compete with Uber, Lyft"}, "Author": "BOBBY KERLIK", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "Our business got turned upside down with Uber and Lyft,\u201d Campolongo said.\nThe service will be similar to the popular Lyft and Uber services, including what Campolongo said are safety upgrades.\nCampolongo said Yellow Z drivers must go through driver training, and their cars must pass a mechanic\u2019s inspection.\n\u201c(Yellow Z drivers) will go out during peak times.\nLyft and Uber officials contend their insurance and safety standards are adequate, and that they improve service."}
