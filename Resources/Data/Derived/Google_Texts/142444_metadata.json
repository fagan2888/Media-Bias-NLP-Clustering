Bob Martinez. Cocktail tables were covered with bumper stickers and \"Keep Luke in Tallahassee\" buttons. Luke is Bondi's 175-pound St. Bernard.\n\nBondi gained a devoted conservative following in the past four years for bashing the Affordable Care Act and fighting to uphold the state's ban on gay marriage.\n\n\"I won't be silenced and I won't be bullied by anyone in D.C.,\" Bondi told cheering supporters Tuesday night. \"Most are just realizing that Obamacare is a disaster for our entire country.\"\n\nNo mention was made of her biggest gaffe, the postponement of an execution last year to host a campaign fundraiser. She later apologized, but the misstep helped draw out a challenger in Sheldon, a former deputy attorney general and secretary of Florida's Department of Children and Families. Sheldon, 67, tried to play up his experience while raising questions about Bondi's ethical conduct, but he couldn't get much attention.\n\nBondi debated him only once and the Florida Democratic Party funneled its money exclusively into the governor's race. Meanwhile, the GOP gave Bondi $2.2 million, including $750,000 from an out-of-state group called the Republican Attorneys General Association, or RAGA. Overall, she raised a total of $5.8 million to Sheldon's $900,000, allowing her to air at least two TV ads to his none.\n\nIn the past week, Sheldon tried to capitalize on media reports about RAGA's influence on Bondi and a Washington, D.C., law firm that wined and dined her as her office dropped or ignored cases involving the firm's clients.\n\nBondi denied any conflict, and on Tuesday night, she expressed no regrets. After giving her victory speech, the campaign played Pat Benatar's Hit Me With Your Best Shot.\n\nPutnam, 40, easily won re-election as the head of the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, a sprawling agency that helps farmers, manages state forests, protects consumers and processes concealed-weapon license applications.\n\nA 10-year veteran of the U.S. House of Representatives, Putnam raised $4.2 million in his personal campaign account to overwhelm the $44,000 his Democratic challenger, Thaddeus Hamilton, scraped together. Putnam is considered a sure bet to run for governor in 2018.\n\nSo is Atwater, 56, who cruised to another four years as CFO, overseeing the investment of state funds, insurance fraud investigations and the workers' compensation system.\n\nAtwater also is a political veteran, with a decade in the Legislature, including serving as Senate president from 2008 to 2010. He raised $4.4 million, while his Democratic opponent, William Rankin, mustered only $41,915.", "article_metadata": {"description": "TAMPA \u2014 Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi won re-election Tuesday with a commanding victory over Democrat George Sheldon and Libertarian candidate Bill Wohlsifer.", "application-name": "Tampa Bay Times", "og": {"url": "http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/elections/florida-cabinet-bondi-putnam-atwater-all-coast-to-reelection/2205119", "image": {"width": 700, "identifier": "http://www.tampabay.com/resources/images/dti/rendered/2014/11/AP_FLPET109_FLORIDA_ATTORNE_14161502_8col.jpg", "height": 498}, "site_name": "Tampa Bay Times", "description": "TAMPA \u2014 Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi won re-election Tuesday with a commanding victory over Democrat George Sheldon and Libertarian candidate Bill Wohlsifer.", "title": "Florida Cabinet: Bondi, Putnam, Atwater all coast to re-election"}, "twitter": {"site": "@TB_Times", "image": "http://www.tampabay.com/resources/images/dti/rendered/2014/11/AP_FLPET109_FLORIDA_ATTORNE_14161502_8col.jpg", "description": "TAMPA \u2014 Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi won re-election Tuesday with a commanding victory over Democrat George Sheldon and Libertarian candidate Bill Wohlsifer.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Florida Cabinet: Bondi, Putnam, Atwater all coast to re-election"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#115220", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=988277045", "msapplication-TileImage": "/iwov-resources/images/ie10TBTpin.png", "__sync_contentCategory": "default", "keywords": "News,Politics,Elections & Campaigns,breaking-news,top-news,florida,news-nav,2014elex", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "News, Politics, Elections & Campaigns, breaking-news, top-news, florida, news-nav, 2014elex"}, "article_summary": "Florida's two other Republican Cabinet members, Chief Financial Officer Jeff Atwater and Commissioner of Agriculture Adam Putnam, won their races by double digits.\nTAMPA \u2014 Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi won re-election Tuesday with a commanding victory over Democrat George Sheldon and Libertarian candidate Bill Wohlsifer.\nPutnam, 40, easily won re-election as the head of the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, a sprawling agency that helps farmers, manages state forests, protects consumers and processes concealed-weapon license applications.\nA 10-year veteran of the U.S. House of Representatives, Putnam raised $4.2 million in his personal campaign account to overwhelm the $44,000 his Democratic challenger, Thaddeus Hamilton, scraped together.\nMeanwhile, the GOP gave Bondi $2.2 million, including $750,000 from an out-of-state group called the Republican Attorneys General Association, or RAGA."}
