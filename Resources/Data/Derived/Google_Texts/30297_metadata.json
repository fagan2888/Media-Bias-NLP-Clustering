On a recent spring day, the tune rarely stopped playing as the entire 35-bed mother-and-baby unit in the Long Tower was occupied.\n\n\u201cIt was beautiful,\u201d said Nicole McCaughin, John Muir\u2019s interim director of women and children\u2019s services. \u201cWe had 35 moms with babies, and that was the first time since we built the Long Tower (in 2011) that every single room was full.\u201d\n\nHospitals around the Bay Area appear to be sharing in the joy, reporting that the number of births has finally started inching up to prerecession levels. John Muir, Lucile Packard, UC San Francisco, Kaiser Permanente and Contra Costa Regional hospital systems all say they are seeing a rise in births after a slowdown during the economic slump.\n\nBut it\u2019s too early to call it a baby boom. The jury is still out on what is leading to the upswing. Some say it could be a confluence of factors: an improving economy, a Bay Area population surge, the addition of more affiliated clinics and doctors\u2019 practices by many major hospital systems and increased medical enrollment because of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cWe are a lot busier than before,\u201d said McCaughin. \u201cThose years of the recession, we were seeing fewer births \u2014 and now, it seems we\u2019re pulling out of it with the recovery.\u201d\n\nMost since 2008\n\nLast year, John Muir saw 2,900 deliveries, its highest since the start of the recession in 2008. From 2010 to 2012, births bottomed out to an average of about 2,530 deliveries a year. \u201cSo far for this year, the hospital looks like it\u2019ll meet or exceed last year\u2019s births, too,\u201d McCaughin said.\n\nLucile Packard Children\u2019s Hospital Stanford in Palo Alto has seen a similar increase, said Yasser El-Sayed, obstetrician-in-chief and co-director of its Johnson Center for Pregnancy and Newborn Services.\n\n\u201cIn the last two years, we have been seeing for the first time this slight uptick of about 100 births each year, when before that we\u2019d been seeing a decline since 2008,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s too strong to say it\u2019s a baby boom. But we\u2019re definitely all seeing a tick up, but whether that\u2019s going to continue to go up, time will tell.\u201d\n\nBirths at UCSF Medical Center rose by 7 percent in fiscal year 2013 and 17 percent in 2014, said UCSF hospital spokeswoman Elizabeth Fernandez. During the recession, it saw nominal increases of 4 percent or less, and even dips of 6 percent in fiscal 2012 and 9 percent in 2010.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo what\u2019s leading to the upswing?\n\nKaiser spokeswoman Deniene Erickson said some of Kaiser\u2019s increases may be due to increased health insurance enrollment with the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cThere are theories, but nobody knows for sure \u2026 One thing that\u2019s been cited is \u2014 and we think it might be \u2014 is that in a better economy, people are most likely to add to their families,\u201d McCaughin said.\n\nThat was the case with Shabana Azmi Shaik, 25, and her husband, Mahaboob, 32, of El Cerrito, whose 7.5-pound boy, Rehann Ali, was born May 28. They waited three years into marriage before having a baby.\n\n\u201cWe had some financial problems \u2014 that\u2019s why we didn\u2019t plan for a baby at first,\u201d she said. But after moving from Arizona to California, they found a more favorable fiscal climate, steady income and more robust health coverage through Medi-Cal.\n\nCan\u2019t yet label it trend\n\nDuring the thick of the recession, the loss of jobs and health insurance made many think twice about signing on to the extra expense of raising a child. The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimated that in 2013 it cost $245,000 to raise a child to age 18.\n\nAccording to the Pew Research Center, 2007 marked a record high number of births in the United States \u2014 4.3 million. But the Great Recession followed, and U.S. births began to decline, even as the nation\u2019s population continues to grow.\n\nSimilarly, in California, 2007 marked a high point since the mid-1990s, with 566,137 births, but since then the number had been dropping every year, until recently. Santa Clara, Contra Costa and Alameda counties are now seeing increases after reporting 8 to 12 percent declines during the recession.\n\nBut the upswing needs to be tracked for five to 10 years before it can be labeled a trend, said Allison Thrash, a Santa Clara County spokeswoman.\n\nFernandez said it\u2019s hard to know precisely what\u2019s behind UCSF\u2019s increase, whether it\u2019s because more women in the Bay Area \u2014 or more women in general \u2014 are having babies, or if more women are choosing to have their babies at UCSF specifically, or even if the recent rise in births is due to the organization\u2019s opening a medical center in Mission Bay this year.\n\nJohn Muir officials also wondered if the opening of a new clinic in 2005 in Brentwood and East County, fast-growing areas of Contra Costa County, may be partly feeding the increases. El-Sayed of Lucile Packard agreed that the rise in birthrates remains a bit of a mystery.\n\n\u201cMy sense of why they are seeing births going up is similar to why you\u2019re seeing on the road that traffic is up,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cMore people are moving in because of a better economy. The Bay Area is always a bit anomalous because it has new technology and young folks coming in. And when that environment is going well and the economy is going well, people will have more babies.\u201d\n\nContact Joyce Tsai at 925-847-2123.
