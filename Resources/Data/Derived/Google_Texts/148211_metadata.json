It also features a partnership that spans three UC campuses. The program is based at the UCSF Philip R.

Courses \u2013 which can be tailored on a track of health policy or health law \u2013 will provide students a solid understanding of contemporary policy issues including health costs, coverage, and disparities and the relationship of these policy issues to the legal system including health care reform and the Affordable Care Act.\n\nTo provide a practical way for working medical or legal professionals to educate themselves about one another\u2019s world, the fully online degree was created with flexibility at the forefront. The program is offered as a one- or two-year program with part-time or full-time options.\n\n\u201cThe Graduate Division is proud to offer another forward-thinking program that reflects the interdisciplinary nature of education at UCSF,\u201d says Elizabeth Watkins, PhD, dean of the Graduate Division and vice chancellor of Student Academic Affairs. \u201cGraduates from the program are sure to be a powerful force for positive change in the health care system.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"Generator": "Mothership (http://mothershipthe.me)", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"url": "https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2016/04/402366/ucsf-uc-hastings-launch-innovative-masters-program-meld-health-and-law", "image": "https://www.ucsf.edu/sites/default/files/styles/2014_news_items_grid/public/field/image/news/HealthLaw.jpg?itok=EZjLcqxT", "site_name": "UC San Francisco", "description": "UCSF and UC Hastings College of the Law have combined their expertise to offer a new degree program: the Masters of Science program in Health Policy and Law, which begins classes in August.", "title": "UCSF, UC Hastings Launch Innovative Masters Program to Meld Health and Law"}, "twitter": {"description": "UCSF and UC Hastings College of the Law have combined their expertise to offer a new degree program: the Masters of Science program in Health Policy and Law, which begins classes in August.", "title": "UCSF, UC Hastings Launch Innovative Masters Program to Meld Health and Law | UC San Francisco", "url": "https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2016/04/402366/ucsf-uc-hastings-launch-innovative-masters-program-meld-health-and-law", "image": "https://www.ucsf.edu/sites/default/files/styles/2014_news_items_grid/public/field/image/news/HealthLaw.jpg?itok=EZjLcqxT", "site": "@ucsf", "card": "summary"}, "HandheldFriendly": "true", "MobileOptimized": "width", "google-site-verification": "rSaM6CprJQndLnVGSxg0oZ-oB85lajeVcjE1fQzK1-I", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "UCSF and UC Hastings College of the Law have combined their expertise to offer a new degree program: the Masters of Science program in Health Policy and Law, which begins classes in August."}, "article_summary": "The degree program is the first to offer an online degree in the field of health policy and law.\nTo help connect the separate entities of medicine and law, UC San Francisco and UC Hastings College of the Law have combined their expertise to offer a new degree program: the Masters of Science program in Health Policy and Law, which begins classes in August.\n\u201cThe Health Policy and Law Masters degree program will train current and future leaders in these fields to work together to improve health care and translate health care research into meaningful health care policy proposals.\u201dDan Dohan, PhD\u201cFrom the UCSF side comes an ability to analyze and understand evidence,\u201d says Dohan.\nApply to the Program Interested in pursuing the online Masters of Science degree in Health Policy and Law?\nThe program is based at the UCSF Philip R.
