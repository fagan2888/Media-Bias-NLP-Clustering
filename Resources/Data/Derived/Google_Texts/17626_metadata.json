He noted that when a president defies the express will of Congress, his power is at its \u0093lowest ebb.\u0094\n\nClick Image to Enlarge Archive of the Sun\n\nRoberts was dissenting in the court\u0092s decision in the so-called Jerusalem passport case. President Obama \u0097 and George W. Bush before him \u0097 had refused to execute a law that would\u0092ve required listing Israel as the country of birth for an American born in Jerusalem.\n\nThe court let Mr. Obama deny the passport listing, but Chief Justice Roberts wrote that Mr. Obama\u0092s power was at its lowest ebb. His point could serve as a marker for much of Obama\u0092s entire tenure, which has often seen presidential power at its lowest ebb \u0097 or in a \u0093zone of twilight.\u0094\n\nBoth phrases are from a famous opinion written in 1952 by Justice Robert Jackson. He was writing about what he called \u0093the actual art of governing.\u0094 This is the shortcoming that has hobbled Mr. Obama\u0092s presidency \u0097 on ObamaCare, immigration, gun control, trade and Iran, to name but a few issues.\n\nJackson was an FDR liberal of the first water, but he understood presidential powers fluctuate depending on relations with Congress. Only with the \u0093express or implied\u0094 authorization of Congress, he wrote, can a president be said to \u0093personify the federal sovereignty.\u0094\n\n\u0093Zone of twilight\u0094 was the phrase Jackson used to describe the predicament where a president acts \u0093in absence of either a congressional grant or denial of authority,\u0094 meaning when Congress is quiet. Either the president or Congress might have the authority, but \u0093its distribution is uncertain.\u0094\n\nA president\u0092s power is at its \u0093lowest ebb,\u0094 Jackson wrote, when he takes measures that are \u0093incompatible with the expressed or implied will of Congress.\u0094 President Obama\u0092s troubles stem from the frequency with which he has found himself in the twilight zone or at the low ebb.\n\nThe Jerusalem case is the least of it. The law the president defied may have been passed by an almost unanimous Congress, but the case was still about a child\u0092s passport. A president skilled in the actual art of governing would\u0092ve found a compromise.\n\nThere are bigger cases. The ObamaCare poser currently before the court should have been an easy fix, if it\u0092s just, as the administration insists, about erroneous wording. Simply send it back to Congress for a rewrite.\n\nIt\u0092s turned into a titanic drama because Congress wouldn\u0092t come close to rewriting it the way the president wants. So he\u0092s now crosswise with the legislature. On the centerpiece of his entire domestic program, he can\u0092t personify the federal sovereignty.\n\nThe same is true for, say, gun control. The president wants to speak for the nation, but he\u0092s without the support of Congress. So his latest gambit is to issue a regulation banning certain bullets that Congress won\u0092t ban. He\u0092s in the twilight zone.\n\nOn some issues \u0097 trade, metadata collection, immigration \u0097 conservatives like me may be with him. But Congress isn\u0092t, at least not yet. Mr. Obama just can\u0092t speak for the federal sovereignty. Nor take a hint. So he\u0092s lurching around in the twilight zone, a weakened figure.\n\nWe\u0092re likely to see this thrown into sharp relief if he gets his deal with the Iranian ayatollahs. Congress doesn\u0092t like this appeasement. It\u0092s made that clear. There may not be a veto-proof majority in Congress against him, however.\n\nThat\u0092s what Jackson meant when he warned of acting against the \u0093express or implied\u0094 will of Congress. The president, he wrote, has but \u0093his own constitutional powers minus any constitutional powers of Congress.\u0094\n\nThis doesn\u0092t mean the president always loses. Mr. Obama defied the express will of Congress in, for example, refusing to enforce the Defense of Marriage Act. And he won. But it\u0092ll be difficult for him to speak with the full federal sovereignty while the two branches are apart.\n\nIt\u0092d be nice to think that whoever ends up as the next president will take this to heart. How wonderful it would be to have a president skilled enough in the actual art of governing as to speak with the authority of the full federal sovereignty.\n\nThis column first appeared in the New York Post.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Why President Obama Finds Himself Stuck In a Twilight Zone", "og": {"url": "http://www.nysun.com/national/why-president-obama-finds-himself-stuck-in/89190/"}, "description": "As the Supreme Court staggers toward the end of its term, I keep thinking about a phrase quoted by the Chief Justice of the United States, John Roberts.
