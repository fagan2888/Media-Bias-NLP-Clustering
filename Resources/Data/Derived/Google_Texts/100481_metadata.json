The 61-year-old Cleveland lawyer is now the panel\u2019s longest-serving member, and he\u2019s still causing headaches for liberals and anyone else who would, in his view, run roughshod over the Constitution to pursue a left-wing agenda in the name of civil rights, including those in the Obama administration.\n\n\u201cThe Fourteenth Amendment, the Fifth Amendment \u2014 you name it \u2014 are violated on a daily basis all across the country by people who think you can engage in racial discrimination if you have good intentions,\u201d said Mr. Kirsanow in an interview.\n\nDuring the Bush presidency, when conservatives controlled the eight-member commission, Mr. Kirsanow confronted such efforts as part of the majority. Last year, however, liberals gained a 6-2 advantage on the panel, meaning that he must often fight his battles alone. Not that he has a problem with that.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re a black conservative, you\u2019re used to being in the minority,\u201d he quipped.\n\nIf anything, being outnumbered has spurred him into overdrive. For months he\u2019s drawn headlines for riding to the defense of constitutional liberties, such as when he challenged Houston Mayor Annise Parker in October over her decision to subpoena pastors\u2019 sermons, calling it \u201can abuse of government power.\u201d\n\nHe warned President Obama and the Congressional Black Caucus that the White House immigration plan would devastate low-skilled workers, a group of Americans that is disproportionately black. He blasted California and the District of Columbia in November for enforcing \u2014 illegally, in his opinion \u2014 the Affordable Care Act\u2019s abortion mandate.\n\nWith the commission planning to hold a hearing on police practices in light of the recent high-profile deaths of unarmed black men, Mr. Kirsanow said he stands ready to use the forum to address \u201cwhether changes in police procedures could do anything to reduce the 6,000 to 6,200 blacks murdered each year by other blacks.\u201d\n\nAll this may explain why former chair Mary Frances Berry put up enormous resistance to his 2001 nomination to the panel. Or why the late Democratic Sen. Ted Kennedy dubbed him \u201cAttila the Hun,\u201d a nickname that has stuck in part because of his dogged personality and in part because of his dramatic appearance.\n\nIt\u2019s safe to say that Mr. Kirsanow stands out in a crowd. At nearly 6-foot-3, he weighs the same as he did when he played wide receiver at Cornell University and boasts a completely bald head, a piercing stare and what may be the most extravagant handlebar mustache since Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria.\n\nWhat\u2019s the story behind the mustache? \u201cIt\u2019s something I\u2019ve had since I was in my 20s. I just started growing it when I was in college, and then one day I started twirling it a little bit and said, \u2018You know, I\u2019m going to go with it,\u2019\u201d Mr. Kirsanow said.\n\n\u201cMy daughter begs me to shave it off,\u201d he added with a laugh. \u201cShe says, \u2018You\u2019ve got enough challenges in your life.\u2019\u201d\n\nHis latest challenge comes with the changing direction of the commission. With the liberal wing in charge, Mr. Kirsanow said he has witnessed a move away from issues that animated the commission during its conservative heyday, including voter fraud and eminent domain abuse, in favor of topics such as illegal immigrant and transgender rights.\n\n\u201cWhat you lose [with a liberal majority] is a dispassionate look at true civil rights issues,\u201d Mr. Kirsanow said. \u201cInstead, what you see is an agenda-driven take on civil rights. It\u2019s not a matter of looking at whether or not civil rights in this country are being enforced, whether there are deprivations of civil rights \u2014 the idea is to expand the concept and definition of civil rights far beyond what our charter is.\n\n\u201cThere is kind of a nascent movement to turn the civil rights commission more into a human rights commission that would look at a variety of things not related to traditional notions of civil rights, such as race discrimination and sex discrimination, but rather class-based issues, ideology-driven issues, grievances that the left embraces,\u201d he said.\n\nLosing the conservative majority also effectively brings to an end the commission\u2019s role as an Obama administration watchdog, exemplified by the panel\u2019s investigations into accusations of voter suppression by the New Black Panther Party in Philadelphia and the Justice Department\u2019s racially discriminatory enforcement of voting rights laws.\n\nAt the same time, Mr. Kirsanow and the panel\u2019s other remaining conservative, University of San Diego School of Law professor Gail Heriot, are not without weapons.\n\nThey receive regular requests for help from individuals across the nation alerting them to the behavior of various political bodies, \u201cand they have this instinctive reaction that there\u2019s something wrong with it, but they don\u2019t know what it is,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhenever we see a topic that we think merits the involvement of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights but is not being addressed by the commission, then we will at least send a letter,\u201d Mr. Kirsanow said. \u201cIn a number of these cases, it\u2019s clear-cut that they\u2019re engaging in unconstitutional actions, and there\u2019s really no dispute about it. And yet these things occur almost on a daily basis.\u201d\n\nNot surprisingly, he periodically comes under fire from liberal groups. The Wichita NAACP called his 2007 reappointment to the commission \u201ctragic\u201d and \u201ctroubling,\u201d citing his opposition to affirmative action and support for school vouchers.\n\nHis former conservative colleagues on the commission are quick to come to his defense.\n\n\u201cPeter is very brilliant,\u201d said Abigail Thernstrom, a prominent public intellectual who served on the panel with Mr. Kirsanow for 12 years. \u201cHe\u2019s the superstar, as far as I\u2019m concerned. He should have this platform. He cares very much about these issues.\u201d\n\nFormer commissioner Todd Gaziano calls Mr. Kirsanow \u201ca great man and a super colleague who is one of the funniest people you\u2019d ever want to work with.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s also a tenacious defender of principle and reason,\u201d said Mr. Gaziano, now executive director of the Pacific Legal Foundation\u2019s Washington, D.C., office. \u201cOne of my primary joys on the commission, which was sometimes a frustrating experience, was working with Pete Kirsanow.\u201d\n\nMr. Kirsanow\u2019s path to the commission started after college. While some of his teammates went on to play football professionally, he headed home to attend the Cleveland-Marshall College of Law. He had always considered himself conservative, but his interest in politics was sparked by his outrage over the 1991 Senate hearings on Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas.\n\n\u201cI saw the manner in which Clarence Thomas was being treated, and I said, \u2018The left\u2019s approach to this was despicable [and] contrary to everything I think in terms of due process and justice,\u2019\u201d Mr. Kirsanow recalled. \u201cAt that point I just devoted myself to reading as much as I could about what was going on in politics. Prior to this, I was just an ordinary American trying to take care of my family and make a living, and within months of the Clarence Thomas hearings, I think I attended my first National Review Institute summit and became a little bit more politically involved.\u201d\n\nAs a labor law expert, he was often asked to testify at congressional hearings. When President George W. Bush nominated him to the civil rights commission, Ms. Berry initially refused to swear him in, arguing the previous commissioner\u2019s term had not expired, and telling Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer that it would take \u201cfederal marshals\u201d to seat him, according to The Associated Press.\n\nThe Supreme Court upheld his appointment, and he later served a concurrent term on the National Labor Relations Board from 2006 to 2008. While he often finds himself in Washington, home is still Cleveland, where he works as a partner at the law firm Benesch, Friedlander, Coplan & Aronoff and lives in what he describes as one of the city\u2019s bluest neighborhoods.\n\n\u201cIn my precinct, when you go to vote and they pull up voter rolls for the primary, my wife and I are the only two Republicans there,\u201d he said with a laugh.\n\nHe traces his patriotism to his father, a former lieutenant in the Soviet Red Army who emigrated to the U.S. after escaping from a detention camp. He and others were sent there after being \u201cadjudged to be insufficiently zealous supporters of Stalin and communism,\u201d Mr. Kirsanow said.\n\nThat perspective leaves him with little patience for the \u201cconstant self-flagellating\u201d of homegrown critics.\n\n\u201cSure, we have flaws, but you could magnify them by a factor of four or five, and we\u2019re still the greatest nation on Earth, bar none,\u201d Mr. Kirsanow said. \u201cNobody else comes close, and we would do well to appreciate the fact that, \u2018Hey, there are some pretty good things about the United States of America, after all.\u2019\u201d\n\nDespite his seniority, Mr. Kirsanow isn\u2019t going anywhere, having been appointed last year to a third six-year term by House Speaker John A. Boehner, Ohio Republican. Four of the commission\u2019s members are appointed by the president, while the other four are named by the House and Senate majority and minority leaders.\n\nThat means voters will need to elect a Republican president if Mr. Kirsanow is to find himself back in the majority. In the meantime, he plans to keep making the most of his backbencher status, which he says actually has its advantages.\n\n\u201cWhen you are in the majority, you\u2019ve got to think about, \u2018OK, what are we going to pursue?\u2019 and you\u2019re being sniped at constantly, and you\u2019re always watching your back,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in the minority, it\u2019s somewhat liberating.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Thirteen years ago liberals fought to keep Peter Kirsanow off the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, a legal brouhaha that went all the way to the Supreme Court.", "Author": "Valerie Richardson", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Thirteen years ago liberals fought to keep Peter Kirsanow off the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, a legal brouhaha that went all the way to the Supreme Court.", "title": "Peter Kirsanow of U.S. Commission on Civil Rights fights bigotry of good intentions", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/feb/1/peter-kirsanow-of-us-commission-on-civil-rights-fi/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/01/2_1_2015_peter-kirsanow-18201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/01/2_1_2015_peter-kirsanow-18201.jpg", "title": "Peter Kirsanow of U.S. Commission on Civil Rights fights bigotry of go", "description": "Thirteen years ago liberals fought to keep Peter Kirsanow off the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, a legal brouhaha that went all the way to the Supreme Court.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Politics, Peter Kirsanow, US Commission, Supreme Court, Cleveland"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1791\"", "article_summary": "It\u2019s not a matter of looking at whether or not civil rights in this country are being enforced, whether there are deprivations of civil rights \u2014 the idea is to expand the concept and definition of civil rights far beyond what our charter is.\n\u201cThere is kind of a nascent movement to turn the civil rights commission more into a human rights commission that would look at a variety of things not related to traditional notions of civil rights, such as race discrimination and sex discrimination, but rather class-based issues, ideology-driven issues, grievances that the left embraces,\u201d he said.\nDuring the Bush presidency, when conservatives controlled the eight-member commission, Mr. Kirsanow confronted such efforts as part of the majority.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re a black conservative, you\u2019re used to being in the minority,\u201d he quipped.\n\u201cWhat you lose [with a liberal majority] is a dispassionate look at true civil rights issues,\u201d Mr. Kirsanow said."}
