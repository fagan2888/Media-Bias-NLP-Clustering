A cardiologist with more than 25 years of experience in clinical practice and hospital administration, McCann knew she couldn\u2019t pass up the opportunity to be part of the wave of changes to the health care system brought about by the new law. To get the tools she\u2019d need, she decided to enroll last year as an MPH student at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.\n\nAfter graduating in May, McCann will return to Central Maine Medical Center in Lewiston, ME, a hospital where she previously worked as a clinician. She\u2019ll serve as an executive in its Accountable Care Organization (ACO), working to help doctors and other health care providers affiliated with the hospital provide coordinated care to their Medicare patients.\n\n\u201cThe old model of health care was that you got hospitalized, you went home, you were done,\u201d McCann said. But ACOs manage a spectrum of care over a long period of time. \u201cThe focus is not on health care, but on being healthy. It\u2019s right up my alley and it\u2019s going to be a lot of fun.\u201d\n\nMcCann enjoys a challenge, and the opportunity to bring people together to work toward a common goal. She served in the Navy early in her medical career, and became director of the cardiac intensive care unit at the National Navy Medical Center in 1994. She later went into private practice before taking a position as division head of the Department of Cardiology at St. Mary\u2019s Regional Medical Center, also in Lewiston.\n\nAs a cardiologist, she was a \u201cjack of all trades,\u201d she said, performing a variety of tasks from implanting pacemakers to counseling patients. She began her career during a time of rapid evolution in cardiology, and loved its spirit of innovation and experimentation. But as the field grew more specialized, her work became more focused on a narrower set of skills.\n\nA taste of public health\n\nTo keep challenging herself professionally, McCann took on new projects on top of her work as a clinician and hospital administrator. At St. Mary\u2019s, she developed and directed the hospital\u2019s cardiovascular disease risk assessment program. She went into workplaces around the state and tested teachers, firefighters, and others on measures such as blood pressure and cholesterol levels.\n\nThe results, she said, were astonishing. Some 60% of people in the groups she measured had a moderate to high risk of a cardiovascular event in the next 10 years. The firefighters\u2019 numbers were particularly worrisome, so she followed up with an intervention. The approach was simple: Give them information about how to lower their risk, and provide exercise equipment to the firehouse to help them take the first step.\n\n\u201cSix months later, we tested the firefighters again and saw a 75% drop in the highest risk and a 50% drop in the moderate risk,\u201d McCann said. \u201cI was the nudge that got them started, but their culture made a choice to change. It was really powerful.\u201d\n\nHaving such direct impact fueled McCann\u2019s growing interest in public health, but when she ultimately arrived at the School she was unsure about which of many possible directions she should choose. So she took courses in consumer behavior and health care marketing, refreshed her knowledge of the basics in epidemiology and statistics, studied \u201cfinance, finance, finance,\u201d and learned from the experiences and idealism of her fellow students.\n\nReturning home\n\nBy the end of her first semester, she finally achieved some clarity. She realized that the place where she could make the biggest impact after graduating was back at Central Maine Medical Center.\n\n\u201cThe next 10 years are going to be a fasten-your-seatbelt period in health care,\u201d McCann said. \u201cI feel that health care providers like me who\u2019ve been in the trenches and understand how health delivery works and understand the role of the physician, the patient, socioeconomic determinants of health, and other intersecting factors, are going to inform the direction.\u201d\n\nFor McCann, taking a year off from her career to get her MPH has made all the difference. \u201cThis was absolutely one of the smartest moves I ever made, right up there after marrying my husband and going to medical school. And the rewards from this experience will just continue.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Amy Roeder", "article_metadata": {"copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The President and Fellows of Harvard College", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "msapplication-TileColor": "#A51C30", "fb": {"admins": "14102788,173700233,100001178456994", "pages": 166496921771}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/wp-content/themes/hsph/images/ms/ms-tile-icon.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe next 10 years are going to be a fasten-your-seatbelt period in health care,\u201d McCann said.\n\u201cThis was absolutely one of the smartest moves I ever made, right up there after marrying my husband and going to medical school.\n\u201cThe focus is not on health care, but on being healthy.\n\u201cThe old model of health care was that you got hospitalized, you went home, you were done,\u201d McCann said.\n\u201cSix months later, we tested the firefighters again and saw a 75% drop in the highest risk and a 50% drop in the moderate risk,\u201d McCann said."}
