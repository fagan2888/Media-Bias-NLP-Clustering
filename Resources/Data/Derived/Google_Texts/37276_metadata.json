While Maduro blames the drought on the El Nino weather phenomenon, critics say the state is also guilty for inadequate investment, preparation and diversification of power sources to avoid over-dependence on the Guri dam.\n\nDaily water and electricity cuts have added to hardship from a deep recession, the world's highest inflation, long lines at shops, and shortages of basics from milk to medicines.\n\n(Additional reporting by Diego Ore; Editing by James Dalgleish)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela on Friday reversed a half-hour time change that was one", "title": "Venezuela scraps half-hour time difference set by Chavez", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/15/Venezuela-scraps-half-hour-time-difference-set-Chavez", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/venezuela-politics_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/15/Venezuela-scraps-half-hour-time-difference-set-Chavez", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/venezuela-politics_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela on Friday reversed a half-hour time change that was one", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "\"It's not true that this will save power because you use the same amount no matter what the time.\"\nA severe drought is affecting the Guri reservoir that provides two-thirds of Venezuela's power needs, and water and electricity outages are frequent.\nOpponents say Venezuela's energy problems are no laughing matter.\nChavez turned Venezuela's clocks back 30 minutes in 2007 so that children could wake up for school in daylight.\n\"Venezuela's new time-zone: hours without light, hours without water, hours of presidential broadcasts, hours of lines,\" quipped comedian Jean Mary Curro in reference to the South American nation's multiple economic problems."}
