The West offense, led by Ole Miss commit QB Shea Patterson, started off with a quick 15 yard pass to Simi Fehoko. After a six yard tackle for loss by Georgia native Josh Brown, Patterson took a shot to the endzone which was broken up by Miami commit Tyler Byrd at the last moment. However on the following play, The West team pulled a trick out of their hat and scored on a double reverse pass which eventually found Simi Fehoko\u2019s hands in the back of the endzone for the touchdown.

Sewo Olonilua capped off the drive with an untouched run up the middle for a touchdown.

Next, he dumped the ball off to his Oregon bound RB Vavae Malepeai who scampered around the left edge for 15 yards. The officials tacked on another 15 yards to the play for a facemask penalty. On the next play, Patterson hit Notre Dame Commit WR Javon McKinley breaking back from a comeback route at the front pile on for another touchdown making the score 19-0. However, the East squad turned the PAT into a scoring opportunity when they blocked the kick and returned it for the 2-pt conversion. The East team\u2019s next possession started at the 35 due to the ball going out of bounds on the kickoff. Louisville commit QB Jawon Pass entered the huddle and seemed poised throughout the drive. He completed multiple first downs, most important being, the 4th and 11 conversion to Austin Mack for 18 yards that brought them to the West 20 yard line. Once in the red zone, Demario McCall was responsible for back-to-back eight yard runs that lead the East down inside the 5 yard line. Eventually McCall served as the decoy when Jawon Pass faked a hand-off to him and kept it himself around the right edge for the East squad\u2019s first TD. The PAT by K Connor Culp was good. California commit RB Melquise Stovall faked the reverse on the next Kickoff and return the ball 54 yards to the East 41 yard line, giving QB K.J. Costello and the West offense great starting position. Costello and WR Tyler Vaughns did not let the opportunity go to waste as they hooked up for a 12 yard first down pass and the 18 yard touchdown pass that capped off the drive. Costello also converted the 2-pt conversion by hitting RB Sewo Olonilua on an arrow route out of the backfield. After a failed East attempt to put points on the board before half, they were forced to punt back to the West team. The West team managed to bring the ball down into the red zone under the command of K.J. Costello and settled for a Skyler Southam field goal with two seconds left in the half. After back to back three and outs by both teams, QB K.J Costello led the West offense to another scoring drive by hitting TE Devin Asiasi on a seam pattern to put them up by four touchdowns.
