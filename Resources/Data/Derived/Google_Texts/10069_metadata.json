The former environmental adviser to President Clinton and chief of staff to PA Governor Tom Wolf is running to unseat Pat Toomey and become Pennsylvania\u2019s first female senator.\n\nIn an interview with Pittsburgh\u2019s Action News 4 on Friday, McGinty spoke about her excitement at the prospect of making Pennsylvania history.\n\nMcGinty should be excited \u2014 we all should. In 2012, the number of women in the Senate reached a record high, 20 out of 100. While that doesn\u2019t exactly make the Senate a bastion of gender equality, even that small improvement has made a difference.\n\nIn 2013, it was the women of the Senate who led the effort to reopen the government following the shutdown. While Ted Cruz was reading Green Eggs and Ham on the floor to filibuster Obamacare, the women of the Senate were leading a bipartisan group to do the people\u2019s business, leading John McCain to joke that \u201cthe women are taking over.\u201d\n\nAnd thank goodness. As Senator Susan Collins said of the struggle to come to agreement on the budget in 2012, \u201cI think if we [women] were in charge of the Senate and of the administration, we would have a budget deal by now,\u201d adding, \u201cwith all deference to our male colleagues, women\u2019s styles tend to be more collaborative.\u201d Sen. Claire McCaskill agreed: \u201cBy nature we are less confrontational and more collaborative,\u201d McCaskill said. \u201cNot only do we want to work in a bipartisan way, we do it.\u201d\n\nMcGinty, the ninth of ten children, was the first person in her family to go to college. Now, as an executive who has run a $100 million business and a public servant who has run a major White House office, she has focused her campaign on supporting working families. Her message has resonated, with endorsements from EMILY\u2019s List, Sen. Bob Casey, President Obama, and Vice President Biden. She is supported by senators like Kirsten Gillibrand and Jeanne Shaheen, who said, \u201cKatie\u2019s spent more than 20 years shattering glass ceilings.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re all for that. With Hillary Clinton on track to win the Democratic nomination, 2016 is shaping up to be a year of shattering glass ceilings at every level.\n\n(AP Photo/Matt Slocum)", "article_metadata": {"description": "2016 is shaping up to be a year of shattering glass ceilings at every level.", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "og": {"site_name": "Blue Nation Review", "description": "2016 is shaping up to be a year of shattering glass ceilings at every level.", "title": "WATCH: Katie McGinty Talks About Her Campaign to Become PA's First Woman Senator", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://bluenationreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/AP_261324722087-2.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-04-02T08:37:38-04:00", "url": "https://bluenationreview.com/mcginty-talks-about-her-campaign-to-become-pas-first-woman-senator/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Blue Nation Review", "description": "2016 is shaping up to be a year of shattering glass ceilings at every level.", "creator": "@bluenationrev", "image": {"src": "https://bluenationreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/AP_261324722087-2.jpg"}, "title": "WATCH: Katie McGinty Talks About Her Campaign to Become PA's First Woman Senator - Blue Nation Review", "site": "@bluenationrev", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Blue Nation", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/bluenationreview", "section": "Democrats", "tag": "Katie McGinty,Pennsylvania,Senate", "published_time": "2016-04-02T08:34:46-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-02T08:37:38-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "With Hillary Clinton on track to win the Democratic nomination, 2016 is shaping up to be a year of shattering glass ceilings at every level.\nShe is supported by senators like Kirsten Gillibrand and Jeanne Shaheen, who said, \u201cKatie\u2019s spent more than 20 years shattering glass ceilings.\u201dWe\u2019re all for that.\nIn an interview with Pittsburgh\u2019s Action News 4 on Friday, McGinty spoke about her excitement at the prospect of making Pennsylvania history.\nHer message has resonated, with endorsements from EMILY\u2019s List, Sen.
