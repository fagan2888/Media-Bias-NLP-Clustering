The report makes for bracing reading. The law will reduce the labor supply by the equivalent of 2.3 million full-time workers, the CBO says \u2014 up from an estimated 800,000 just three years ago.\n\nIt gets worse. The CBO also concluded that the law\u2019s \u201cexpanded Medicaid eligibility \u2026 will, on balance, reduce incentives to work.\u201d Think about that: Obamacare is giving low-income Americans fewer reasons to work \u2014 to find and pursue the jobs that could transform their lives and the lives of those around them. The president talks a lot about tackling inequality. But his health care law is a recipe for increasing inequality, not decreasing it.\n\nObamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion doesn\u2019t just discourage work; it also prioritizes coverage for able-bodied adults over the needs of persons with disabilities. That\u2019s a dirty little secret the Obama administration and its liberal allies, in their rush to expand government-funded health coverage to millions more Americans, won\u2019t tell you. And it\u2019s yet another reason why states should resist the siren song of the administration and its leftist supporters, who plan to spend 2014 persuading them to embrace the expansion.\n\nAccording to the Kaiser Family Foundation, in 2012 more than half a million seniors and people with disabilities on state Medicaid lists were awaiting access to home and community-based services. Prompt access to these services could keep individuals with disabilities out of institutions, which are often more costly.\n\nYet Obamacare provides states with a much greater federal Medicaid match \u2014 100 percent for the first three years, phasing down to 90 percent over time \u2014 to cover previously ineligible low-income individuals. According to the Urban Institute, nearly five in six adults to be covered under the Medicaid expansion are adults without children, most in their prime working years.\n\nIn other words, Obamacare\u2019s incentive structure places a greater emphasis on expanding coverage to these able-bodied adults \u2014 the vast majority of whom could be working or preparing for work \u2014 than helping the individuals with disabilities Medicaid was initially created to serve.\n\nThat\u2019s not compassionate \u2014 just the opposite, in fact. So while the president\u2019s advisers ask why states aren\u2019t expanding Medicaid under Obamacare, I have another question for President Obama: Why is expanding Medicaid to cover millions of working-age Americans a bigger priority than giving access to hundreds of thousands of people with disabilities waiting for care?", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO Magazine", "description": "Opinion: The verdict is in on the president's health care law, and it\u2019s not good.", "title": "Obamacare Is Anything But Compassionate", "url": "http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/02/obamacare-costs-jobs-hurts-most-vulnerable-103299.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/02/09/140209_jindal_affordablecareact_ap.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Obamacare,Bobby Jindal,In The Arena", "twitter": {"site": "@politicomag", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politicomag"}, "description": "Opinion: The verdict is in on the president's health care law, and it\u2019s not good.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd087b\"", "article_summary": "In The Arena Obamacare Is Anything But CompassionateThe verdict is in, and it\u2019s not good: Obamacare is rippling through the U.S. economy with vast implications for American prosperity.\nYet Obamacare provides states with a much greater federal Medicaid match \u2014 100 percent for the first three years, phasing down to 90 percent over time \u2014 to cover previously ineligible low-income individuals.\nThat\u2019s not compassionate \u2014 just the opposite, in fact.\nOn Friday, we learned that the Obama economy has hit stall speed, with a paltry 113,000 jobs added in January.\nObamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion doesn\u2019t just discourage work; it also prioritizes coverage for able-bodied adults over the needs of persons with disabilities."}
