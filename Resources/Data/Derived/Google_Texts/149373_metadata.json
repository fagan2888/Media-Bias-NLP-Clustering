After first complaining that 9/11 wasn\u2019t given sufficient media coverage to pay tribute to the anniversary, Melissa Joan then allegedly exploited the significance by publicizing her decision to \u201chonor\u201d the day with free shipping for products from her King Of Harts attire business, reported MSN.\n\nThe contradictions from the former Sabrina the Teenage Witch and Clarissa Explains It All star began when Melissa Joan said that given so much media attention shines on the Kardashian family, a single day should be devoted to covering 9/11.\n\nOn that same day, Hart publicized her business by saying her King Of Harts enterprise was offering free shipping for purchasers using the 911 code. The backlash was immediate, with Melissa Joan facing accusations that she had hyped her decision to honor the day in order to profit.\n\n\u201cI hope those that know what I stand for know that I never meant to have the attention turn to me today. I was merely venting,\u201d tweeted Hart.\n\nIn addition, Melissa Joan shared her defense on Facebook.\n\n\u201cI want to apologize for yesterday\u2019s free shipping post. It was meant to be my small way to give something back. I wanted to cover the shipping charges as a heartfelt gesture, not an exploit of 9/11. I see now how it was interpreted and viewed as being in bad taste. I apologize. It was a mistake.\u201d\n\nFor Hart, however, her decision to express herself at length initially by criticizing the media\u2019s coverage of 9/11 while at the same time publicizing her own clothing line has resulted in a virtual firestorm, reported the Wrap.\n\nMelissa Joan, who also had starred in Melissa & Joey prior to its cancellation, tweeted about specific news outlets\u2019 coverage.\n\n\u201cExtremely disappointed in @foxnews and @CNN for not having continual coverage of Sept11 memorial &names listed on the banner!!#neverforget,\u201d declared Hart.\n\nThe actress also argued that it made a bad impression on her children.\n\n\u201cMy children need to know that this day changed our lives in the U.S. and the world and without solid news coverage, I\u2019m discouraged\u2026 If Kardashians can be covered 24/7 why can\u2019t we have one day dedicated to a moment in history that changed our path? I don\u2019t need to see tragedy, I need to see stories of healing &memory!\u201d\n\nBut when it came to focusing only on her desire to remember and honor 9/11, Melissa Joan shifted her tone by including her King of Harts company in an Instagram post.\n\n\u201cFree Shipping in honor of the victims, families & first responders of 9/11. Use the promo code \u2018911\u2019 during your online checkout at KingofHarts.com.\u201d\n\nWhat do you think about Melissa Joan Hart\u2019s comments on social media?
