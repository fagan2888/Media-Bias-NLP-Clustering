The numbers aren\u2019t even close.\n\nAccording to a Pew Poll in December, Americans are more apathetic about any kind of military intervention than ever before. For example, in 1976, after years of fighting in Vietnam and nearly 60,000 American casualties, 42 percent of Americans agreed that \u201cthe U.S. should mind its own business internationally and let other countries get along the best they can on their own.\u201d Today, that number is 52 percent, marking the first time since the poll was first taken in 1964 that a majority of Americans have felt this way (for context, that number was only 30 percent in 2002).\n\nOf course, members of both parties in DC talk to their constituents and know the feeling out there, which is why we don\u2019t hear a thing about military options when it comes to stopping Vladimir Putin taking over Ukraine and Crimea like he\u2019s playing a drunken game of Risk.\n\nCritics of the President\u2019s handling of the Russia\u2019s aggression are justified when stating his strategy is incoherent and inept. The problem is, while there isn\u2019t a shortage of the usual amount of complainers, seemingly no one has a solution of their own with any real teeth. We\u2019ve seen this movie before when in Iran, Syria and now Ukraine; Mr. Obama has few options outside of threatening sanctions and talking tough, with the latter action being seen as a punch line by the macho Putin more than anything else.\n\nConservatives, of course, are enjoying seeing the President get bullied by the Russians, while Democrats are just happy the conversation isn\u2019t about Obamacare for five minutes. Either way, there are no winners when it comes to the situation in Ukraine. It\u2019s like Syria on steroids; a messy state of affairs in a part of the world few Americans could find on a map, let alone articulate how it affects our national interest.\n\nSo war-weariness from Afghanistan and Iraq has more of us singing Give Peace a chance, right? Yes\u2026but it\u2019s not just those two wars that have us beaten down from banging the war drum. When you think about it, we haven\u2019t had a conclusive war with a definitive, positive end since World War II. Whether it was Korea, Vietnam, Black Hawk Down/Somalia (not a war, of course, but a big black eye in terms of U.S. pride), then Afghanistan and Iraq. All had mixed to poor results. All were without a clear objective and conclusion. All, unfortunately, resulted in plenty of loss of blood and treasure\u2026\n\nAs for objective, the old rule is action should only be taken when our national interests are at stake. And more Americans just don't see\u2014in Syria and Ukraine, for example\u2014anything in those places that truly (or at least, immediately) affects their daily lives. It's also why ratings haven't really spiked on the cable news front on the Ukraine story (CNN saw a modest bump last Friday). The media wants us to care, but those sitting at home are more interested in selfies by Ellen than something as mundane as an unwarranted invasion by a superpower wannabe of a sovereign nation.\n\nAnother factor in this malaise? The sluggish U.S. economy: More folks are leaving the workforce than ever (102 million Americans are currently not working, according to Forbes Magazine) and a sluggish recovery in general has more citizens preferring we concentrate on our domestic issues instead of helping other countries solve theirs.\n\nFifty-two percent of Americans want us to mind our own business.\n\nThey say stay out of Iran.\n\nSteer clear of Syria.\n\nAnd leave Ukraine and Crimea to fend for themselves.\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s foreign policy may be feckless, but he won\u2019t get too much flack for it.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "@ConchaMedia"}, "keywords": "U.S. News,", "publicationDate": 201403041045, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/us-news", "news_keywords": "US News", "pageNum": 1, "title": "If It Isnt Our Problem, Dont Solve It, Say Americans", "tags": "topic:us-news", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "The majority of Americans are on the same page when it comes to military involvement overseas: Unless our national interests are at stake, stay out of it.", "title": "If It Isn\u2019t Our Problem, Don\u2019t Solve It, Say Americans", "url": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/03/04/if-it-isn-t-our-problem-don-t-solve-it-say-americans.html", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/03/04/if-it-isn-t-our-problem-don-t-solve-it-say-americans/jcr:content/image.img.2000.jpg/1393957861185.cached.jpg", "type": "article"}, "environment": "dev", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "type": "house", "description": "The majority of Americans are on the same page when it comes to military involvement overseas: Unless our national interests are at stake, stay out of it.", "sectionTaxanomies": "us-news", "fb": {"admins": "1703087,30000737,1117577220,1276800108,931159,514915512", "app_id": 189930913679}, "authors": "Joe Concha", "article": {"section": "us-news", "published_time": "2014-03-04T10:45:00.000Z", "author": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/joe-conchahtml"}, "resourceType": "dailybeast2/components/pages/article", "contentpath": "/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/03/04/if-it-isn-t-our-problem-don-t-solve-it-say-americans", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"If It Isn\u2019t Our Problem, Don\u2019t Solve It, Say Americans\",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/03/04/if-it-isn-t-our-problem-don-t-solve-it-say-americans.html\",\"image_url\":\"http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/03/04/if-it-isn-t-our-problem-don-t-solve-it-say-americans/jcr:content/image.crop.410.273.jpg/46465262.cached.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/03/04/if-it-isn-t-our-problem-don-t-solve-it-say-americans\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-03-04T10:45:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"U.S. News\",\"author\":\"Joe Concha\",\"tags\":[\"us-news\"]}", "authorIds": "/etc/authors/j/joe-concha", "content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde6ce\"", "article_summary": "When you think about it, we haven\u2019t had a conclusive war with a definitive, positive end since World War II.\nAnd more Americans just don't see\u2014in Syria and Ukraine, for example\u2014anything in those places that truly (or at least, immediately) affects their daily lives.\nAccording to a Pew Poll in December, Americans are more apathetic about any kind of military intervention than ever before.\nThe problem is, while there isn\u2019t a shortage of the usual amount of complainers, seemingly no one has a solution of their own with any real teeth.\nWar GamesThe majority of Americans are on the same page when it comes to military involvement overseas: Unless our national interests are at stake, stay out of it."}
