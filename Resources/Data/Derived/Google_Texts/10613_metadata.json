I thought about it for 15 or 20 seconds, said, \u201cSure,\u201d and it has been my great fortune that it rolled on week after week, year after year.\n\nSo, what\u2019ll I do now? Well, most immediately, I\u2019m involved in a book project with Tim Jackson, head of the Colorado Automobile Dealers Association; the occasion is the 100th anniversary of the dealer group. My family has been involved in the car business dating back more than 80 years and I maintain a license to sell. Jan and I continue to oversee a large family, with lots of gatherings. Plus, after all these years, I don\u2019t believe I\u2019ve expended my allotment of words and I may write a bit more about cars. Of course, there are fishing and gardening and traveling, too.\n\nI became the Post\u2019s Page One Editor way back in the early 1970s when the Vietnam War was winding down and troubles were piling up for President Nixon. It became my responsibility in the mid-\u201970s to create an automotive page for the Post, and soon I became the automotive reviewer. I\u2019ve been at that off and on since, taking an odyssey in the 1980s for Wells Auto Sales and the history book division of Curtis Publishing Co. and a stop at the Pueblo Chieftain, where I launched a car column. I spent the \u201990s over at the Rocky (Rocky Mountain News) writing about cars and heading up a team producing special sections. I returned home to The Post in 2000.\n\nAmong highlights was a flight to Whitehorse in the Canadian Yukon in February 2004 to drive Porsche Cayenne SUVs on lakes frozen 3 to 4-feet thick; an earlier trip to Canada, to Winnipeg in 1978, where I found the elusive Charles Pogue, inventor of the famed high-fuel-mileage carburetor of the 1930s. Did he sell out to the oil companies, as was rumored for years? I don\u2019t know; he said he didn\u2019t.\n\nThere was the lunch with General Motors\u2019 car czar Bob Lutz and Post publisher Dean Singleton at Ellyngton\u2019s in the Brown Palace in the summer of \u201904. I bumped into Lutz in January 2013 at the unveiling of the 2014 Chevrolet Corvette in Detroit, where, after our greetings, he asked, \u201cHow is Dean Singleton?\u201d The Colorado Car Book was published in 1996.\n\nAnd numerous trips to Detroit, and, following our first January stop there for the big auto show, Jan informed me, \u201cI won\u2019t be doing Detroit in the winter anymore.\u201d And, she didn\u2019t.\n\nIn June 2009, I was honored when the Colorado Automobile Dealers Association named its board meeting room in its large William D. Barrow office building, \u201cThe Bud Wells Board Room.\u201d Three years later, at the Gunnison Car Show, Mike Callihan presented me with the Lee Iacocca Award.\n\nFavorite cars? Too many to mention. I\u2019ll always remember the great drive in the 1980 Porsche 928, ticket and all. And, of course, the wonderful 2013 Mercedes-Benz SL550 which carried Jan and me to Gunnison for the award. Oh, my.\n\nBeing hospitalized in late January 2012 cost me my claim to never having missed a column. That week was the only miss, ever, even for vacations. Gaining a position with The Denver Post was a dream come true for this kid from Wray, Colo.\n\nRegarding the Miata, it\u2019s barely bigger than a large skateboard (much more expensive, though, $32,735), and it\u2019s a fun drive.\n\nThey\u2019ve all been fun.\n\nThank you, readers.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "\u201914 Mazda Miata power retractable-top No. 1,850", "title": "\u201914 Mazda Miata power retractable-top No. 1,850", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/06/27/14-mazda-miata-power-retractable-top-no-1850/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-27T11:08:28+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-27T11:08:28+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9c89\"", "article_summary": "From the driver seat of the 2014 Mazda MX-5 Miata, I wave \u201cfarewell\u201d to my loyal, longtime readers.\nGaining a position with The Denver Post was a dream come true for this kid from Wray, Colo.\nRegarding the Miata, it\u2019s barely bigger than a large skateboard (much more expensive, though, $32,735), and it\u2019s a fun drive.\nI thought about it for 15 or 20 seconds, said, \u201cSure,\u201d and it has been my great fortune that it rolled on week after week, year after year.\nThe Denver Post is discontinuing my automotive columns after this weekend."}
