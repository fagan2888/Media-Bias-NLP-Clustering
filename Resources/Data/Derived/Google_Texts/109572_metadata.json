He made the comments during a luncheon at the Republican National Convention, which is actively trying to dispel the party\u2019s anti-woman image.\n\nDuring his speech, Huckabee also likened Obamacare\u2019s expanded contraception coverage to a sugar daddy. Democrats want women to think \u201cthey are helpless without Uncle Sugar coming in and providing for them a prescription each month for birth control because they cannot control their libido or their reproductive system without the help of government,\u201d he said. Republicans, by contrast, want to \u201cempower them to be something other than victims of their gender.\u201d\n\nWatch it:\n\n\n\nWhile these comments have sparked fresh outrage, the former governor has been blithely offending women for most of his career. In the past, he\u2019s speculated that women have trouble multitasking during their periods and passionately supported former Rep. Todd Akin (R-MO) after the failed Senate candidate claimed victims of \u201clegitimate rape\u201d can\u2019t get pregnant. He has also specifically endorsed the belief that \u201cwives graciously submit to their husband\u2019s sacrificial leadership.\u201d\n\nGOP strategists have worked hard since the 2012 election to keep Republicans from alienating female voters by holding training sessions and advising candidates to simply avoid talking about rape. But offensive comments by prominent Republicans keep thwarting these efforts. On Wednesday alone, one GOP congressman running for re-election argued that wives should \u201cvoluntarily submit\u201d to their husbands, while another Congressional candidate dropped out in the midst of a firestorm over his justification of marital rape.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "The former Arkansas governor says providing birth control coverage makes the government \"Uncle Sugar.\"", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "The former Arkansas governor says providing birth control coverage makes the government \"Uncle Sugar.\"", "title": "Mike Huckabee: Giving Women Birth Control Coverage Assumes They Can\u2019t Control Their Sex Drives", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/01/23/3199081/huckabee-women-libido/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/huckabee-e1390505657614.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The former Arkansas governor says providing birth control coverage makes the government \"Uncle Sugar.\"", "title": "Mike Huckabee: Giving Women Birth Control Coverage Assumes They Can\u2019t Control Their Sex Drives", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/huckabee-e1375971100615-321x214.jpg", "creator": "@avivash", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/huckabee-e1390505657614.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/huckabee-e1390505657614.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-23T14:40:55+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/avivawshen"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf288\"", "article_summary": "Health Mike Huckabee: Giving Women Birth Control Coverage Assumes They Can\u2019t Control Their Sex Drives CREDIT: AP Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, a Republican who is considering a run for president in 2016.\nFormer Arkansas Governor and Fox News commentator Mike Huckabee (R) asserted Wednesday that Democrats are telling women \u201cthey cannot control their libido\u201d by offering no-copay contraception through the Affordable Care Act.\nDuring his speech, Huckabee also likened Obamacare\u2019s expanded contraception coverage to a sugar daddy.\nHe made the comments during a luncheon at the Republican National Convention, which is actively trying to dispel the party\u2019s anti-woman image.\nBut offensive comments by prominent Republicans keep thwarting these efforts."}
