That was one of my favorite pictures, I know that. If you go look a the picture, there's Lawrence [Taylor], myself and Erik Howard, and we're standing there making the sign of a safety.\"\n\nThe Giants went on to win Super Bowl XXI, 30-29, and Marshall finished with two sacks and a fumble recovery.\n\nMarshall also had a sack in the Giant's 20-19 victory over the Buffalo Bills in Super Bowl XXV.\n\n\"We didn't say nothing to him,\" Marshall said on his sack of Buffalo's Jim Kelly. \"The deal was, you never piss 'em [off] when they needed to be. They didn't need any more motivation, they were already motivated enough. Bill Parcells would always say, 'Act like you've been there before.'\"", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "super-bowl-2014", "title": "Super bowl memories: Former Giants DE Leonard Marshall talks key sacks", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Super bowl memories: Former Giants DE Leonard Marshall talks key sacks\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/super-bowl/index.ssf/2014/02/super_bowl_memories_former_giants_de_leonard_marshall_talks_key_sacks.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/super_bowl_blog/photo/lmarshalljpg-2b3a1da18b187ca9.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"12111145\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-02-01T19:02:55Z\", \"author\": \"A.J.
