Because Time Warner already has technicians who install its equipment and services in customers' homes, it can use that workforce to install a TelyHD Pro videoconferencing unit in the home of a recently discharged patient. Teleconferencing lets the patient check in with a doctor by video rather than driving in for an office visit.\n\nTime Warner announced Cleveland Clinic as the first partner to launch a trial implementation of the customized teleconferencing system in November. That trial is focused on providing follow-up care for cardiac patients, and so far has been extended to a few dozen patients, said Satya Parimi, group vice president, product management, Time Warner Cable Business Services. \"We're making sure the process works well, and the technology works to their satisfaction, before opening it up to a wider population,\" he said. \"We're looking to ramp up the number of patients over the next couple of months.\"\n\n[Are digital fitness gadgets worth the hassle?

The TelyHD Pro version adds support for connecting to common business videoconferencing systems, and the company has also developed a software package called TelyMed for healthcare customers. As part of Cleveland Clinic's virtual visits project, Tely Labs also tweaked the TelyHD Pro hardware to meet the requirements of the Clinic and Time Warner.\n\n\"Healthcare is probably the single most exciting vertical we're looking at that's underserved this class of video,\" said Tely Labs CEO Sreekanth Ravi. Part of the Affordable Care Act is an effort to \"put a lid on healthcare costs,\" he noted, and hospitals are under particular pressure to reduce readmissions. The virtual visits concept would allow patients to recover at home, but still be closely monitored through video check-ins with a doctor. \"They can stay in the comfort of their home and get more frequent care,\" he said.\n\nIn addition to videoconferencing, the device is capable of collecting data from health-monitoring devices via WiFi, Bluetooth, or a USB port. With the right assortment of monitoring gadgets, \"that's almost to the point where you could gather all the vitals the nurse takes when you come into the office,\" Ravi said.\n\nTime Warner recommended Tely Labs because its product is easy to use, according to Parimi. Tely Labs finds Time Warner to be a good partner because cable Internet supports the bandwidth required for good video and the Time Warner workforce can perform installations in tens of millions of homes -- potentially, even more, with its pending acquisition by Comcast. \"Getting access to the consumer's home is not a trivial thing,\" said Ravi.\n\nOne of the main things to be established during the trial is whether Time Warner's schedule can be meshed with Cleveland Clinic's, Parimi said. To cater to recently discharged patients, who might be in and out of the home for follow-up doctor's visits, technicians need to schedule the timing of the camera installation differently than for a basic cable hookup. Once they get into the home, they must work out details such as positioning the TV and the lighting in the room to ensure it will work for videoconferencing. \"Sometimes, the lighting can be a little difficult,\" he said.\n\nRavi said Tely Labs is working with a half dozen other hospitals on similar trials.\n\nDownload Healthcare IT in the Obamacare Era, the InformationWeek Healthcare digital issue on the impact of new laws and regulations.
