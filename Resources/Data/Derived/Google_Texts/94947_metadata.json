Matt Bevin\u2019s first. His top task will be to craft a proposed state budget \u2014 a challenging endeavor considering over a billion dollars in state contributions requested by the state pension systems and looming costs of expanded Medicaid coverage.\n\nFormer Democratic state Treasurer Jonathan Miller, now an attorney with Frost Brown Todd, said Bevin\u2019s budget will be the state\u2019s first insight into what kind of governor he\u2019s going to be.\n\n\u201cThe budget is a moral document. The budget outlines priorities for how you think the best way to address the state\u2019s great problems,\u201d Miller said.\n\nDuring his campaign, Bevin said that the state will have to undergo \u201cbelt-tightening across the board.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is going to have to be what is often referred to in the global economy as austerity measures in the state of Kentucky,\u201d Bevin said during the final debate at KET.\n\nMiller singled out Bevin\u2019s appointments of state budget director John Chilton, chief of staff Blake Brickman and executive cabinet Secretary Scott Brinkman as good picks to assemble \u201ca solid, bipartisan\u201d document.\n\n\u201cSome of us who were fearful that [Bevin] was going to run a really right-wing-type, tea party, ideological government have been comforted to a degree by the people he\u2019s surrounded himself with,\u201d Miller said.\n\n\u201cAnd then there are examples of him stripping away voting rights by executive order and being seen as kowtowing to Kim Davis, and so those raise alarms that he\u2019s going to be shooting for a more divisive agenda.\u201d\n\nRelated Story Bevin Offers Hints \u2014 But Few Details \u2014 of Future Medicaid Reforms In Kentucky\n\nOn Wednesday, Bevin announced that he would be transforming Kentucky\u2019s expanded Medicaid system. Although he provided few details, the governor said he is working with the federal government to modify the Medicaid expansion \u2014 initiated by former Gov. Steve Beshear through the Affordable Care Act \u2014 which covers more than 500,000 low-income Kentuckians.\n\nBevin has said he wants to model Kentucky\u2019s Medicaid expansion on that of Indiana, which requires most enrollees to pay a portion of their premiums.\n\nListen\n\nThere Will Be Politics\n\nDemocrats\u2019 slim majority in the state House is the only thing standing in the way of a clear legislative path for Republicans.\n\nHouse Speaker Greg Stumbo will be challenged with maintaining order in his Democratic ranks while pushing for his own agenda in an increasingly Republican capitol building.\n\n\u201cThe Democrats in the House are the sole source of power for Democrats in Frankfort,\u201d said former Secretary of State Trey Grayson, a Republican.\n\nDemocrats do also have the statewide officers of attorney general, held by Andy Beshear, and secretary of state, held by Allison Lundergan Grimes.\n\nBut when it comes to the legislative process, Democrats will no longer have a governor to threaten to veto legislation, make tactical appointments or raise money for the state party. And their numbers have dwindled since Bevin\u2019s election: When the legislative session begins, there will be 50 Democrats and 46 Republicans.\n\n\u201cYou gotta take care of your allies and you have to build that coalition, to not just pass legislation but to put yourself in the best position to get reelected,\u201d Grayson said.\n\nSince Bevin\u2019s election, Republicans have made flipping the House a priority. Two state representatives have switched their party affiliation from Democrat to Republican \u2014 Louisville Rep. Denny Butler and Providence Rep. Jim Gooch.\n\nBevin has also been successful in picking off two Democratic representatives with appointments: He named Hopkinsville Rep. John Tilley to be secretary of the Justice Cabinet and gave South Shore Rep. Tanya Pullin an administrative judge position in Bowling Green.\n\nBevin will set the date for special elections for representatives who have resigned, which also includes new Republican Auditor Mike Harmon and Republican Agriculture Commissioner Ryan Quarles.\n\nLabor, Charter Schools Also on the Agenda\n\nBevin has made right-to-work, repealing the prevailing wage and charter schools top priorities of his administration. The Republican-led Senate has approved legislation on those fronts in recent years, only to be thwarted by the state House.\n\nMiller said Stumbo has two paths to choose from in the upcoming legislative session. One is that he works with the Republican leadership.\n\n\u201cThat could be a path to show the state that having the divided government with checks and balances is the most successful kind of government,\u201d Miller said. \u201cFolks can disagree on some issues but when it comes to the future of the state they can get together and pass important bills.\u201d\n\nIn the other scenario, Miller said, Stumbo could play a more traditional opposition role. There\u2019s recent precedent for that: Former Republican Senate President David Williams spent years thwarting the plans of Democratic governors.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019d be a much tougher path for the Speaker,\u201d Grayson said. \u201cI think the Speaker is a guy who\u2019s always prided himself on being a dealmaker, on advancing the state and getting things passed and getting stuff done.\u201d\n\nOn the other side of the capitol, the Republican-led Senate will have a better chance at passing conservative legislation under Bevin. Senate President Robert Stivers is at the helm of a Republican caucus which has 27 out of 38 seats in that chamber.\n\nBut Grayson said just because Stivers and Bevin are in the same party doesn\u2019t mean they won\u2019t disagree sometimes.\n\n\u201cThe one thing that will be interesting is watching interaction between the state Senate, which has all those folks that have been around longer, who understand the issues better, have been engaged in the process longer than the new administration,\u201d he said.\n\nStivers has been president of the state Senate since 2012, when he assumed the post after Williams was appointed to a circuit judge position by then-Gov. Steve Beshear.\n\nStivers has been praised for working across the aisle despite being for many years the leader of the lone Republican stronghold in the capitol.\n\nThe chamber has for the past several years approved traditionally conservative legislation, including right-to-work, eliminating the prevailing wage, tort reform and anti-abortion measures such as informed consent.\n\nThe Democratic-led House has thwarted those measures, and as long as they maintain their majority, Miller said those bills will continue to fail.\n\n\u201cThose are issues that are really at the heart of what the Democratic Party stands for and Democrats are,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would seem to be a longshot to be able to pick enough Democrats off to be able to change things.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "There\u2019s a long road ahead\u00a0in the upcoming legislative session in Frankfort, and several key players in Kentucky\u2019s legislature will be driving the wagon.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "89.3 WFPL", "description": "There\u2019s a long road ahead\u00a0in the upcoming legislative session in Frankfort, and several key players in Kentucky\u2019s legislature will be driving the wagon.", "title": "What To Expect From the Kentucky General Assembly Session", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1400, "identifier": "http://wfpl.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Capitol-Thinkstock.jpg", "height": 933}, "updated_time": "2016-01-04T07:08:21-04:00", "url": "http://wfpl.org/political-landscape-ahead-of-2016-general-assembly/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "There\u2019s a long road ahead\u00a0in the upcoming legislative session in Frankfort, and several key players in Kentucky\u2019s legislature will be driving the wagon.", "creator": "@RylandKY", "image": "http://wfpl.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Capitol-Thinkstock.jpg", "title": "What To Expect From the Kentucky General Assembly Session", "site": "@WFPLNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100006229511236, "pages": 33077174555, "app_id": 1539400482939529}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wfpllouisville", "section": "Politics", "tag": "kentucky general assembly", "published_time": "2016-01-01T07:04:58-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-04T07:08:21-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "There\u2019s recent precedent for that: Former Republican Senate President David Williams spent years thwarting the plans of Democratic governors.\nStivers has been president of the state Senate since 2012, when he assumed the post after Williams was appointed to a circuit judge position by then-Gov.\nAnd their numbers have dwindled since Bevin\u2019s election: When the legislative session begins, there will be 50 Democrats and 46 Republicans.\nThere\u2019s a long road ahead in the upcoming legislative session in Frankfort, and several key players in Kentucky\u2019s legislature will be driving the wagon.\nDemocrats do also have the statewide officers of attorney general, held by Andy Beshear, and secretary of state, held by Allison Lundergan Grimes."}
