This was announced today by both NASA and NOAA, the Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency.\n\nFive months last year set temperature records. The ocean surface was unusually warm around the world, except for Antarctica. In the U.S., the Western part of the country baked under extreme heat, shown here in yellow, although the Eastern half of the country saw below-average temperatures, as seen in blue. And there were temperature records set in several European countries.\n\nWell, we get further insight and information on all of this from one of the lead scientists involved with the report.\n\nGavin Schmidt studies climate change at NASA\u2019s Goddard Institute for Space Studies.\n\nAnd, Gavin Schmidt, we welcome you to the program.\n\nGAVIN SCHMIDT, NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies: Thank you very much for having me.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: So spell this out a little bit more for us. How did 2014 differ from other years?\n\nGAVIN SCHMIDT: Well, 2014 was only a little bit different from previous years, but what we\u2019re seeing is a long-term trend that is producing record warm year after record warm year.\n\nThe previous record was in 2010, before that 2005, before that 1998. So this year is part of a long-term trend that is just going to continue.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: But, when you say it\u2019s only a little different, I mean, by a fraction of a fraction, is that right?\n\nGAVIN SCHMIDT: Right.\n\nSo, there is \u2014 there \u2014 each year makes a record. It\u2019s like people running a marathon. They only beat the record by a few seconds each time, but times are getting faster. The globe is warming up.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: And am I right? I believe I read today that the 10 hottest years on record have all occurred since 1997?\n\nGAVIN SCHMIDT: Yes, that\u2019s right.\n\nNine of those have occurred in the last 10 years. 1998 was a real standout year, and so that\u2019s still in the top five. But we have warmed about 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit since the beginning of the 20th century \u2014 beginning of the 20th century. And we attribute those changes mainly to the increase in greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide, that we have been putting into the atmosphere.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: And just to be clear, we showed a map of the United States, the Western part of the country very hot, but the Eastern part of the United States cooler. But you still had, overall, this record.\n\nGAVIN SCHMIDT: That\u2019s right.\n\nIn any one year, there is a lot of variability. Sometimes, you have an El Nino event in the Tropical Pacific. That could make a difference. You always have weather and various natural variability that is going on, and so you never see a uniform pattern. You are always going to see some place that were warmer, some places that were cooler.\n\nBut in our analysis, we\u2019re trying to average over all of those things to get a sense of what the whole globe is seeing on a long-term scale.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: So what do you and other scientists believe is going on here?\n\nGAVIN SCHMIDT: Well, so, year to year, there\u2019s a lot of noise, a lot of chaos and dynamism in the climate system.\n\nBut the underlying trend, the trends that we have seen since the 1970s particularly, that\u2019s being driven, that\u2019s being pushed. And it\u2019s being pushed mainly by carbon dioxide increases in the atmosphere, which are adding to the greenhouse effect, which is making the planet warmer.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Carbon dioxide, meaning manmade emissions?\n\nGAVIN SCHMIDT: Yes, carbon dioxide mainly comes from the burning of fossil fuels, coal, oil, natural gas, and from deforestation, mainly in the tropics.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: So, to the skeptics who are out there vocally when a report like this comes out, saying, wait a minute, there\u2019s no proof that there is connection to what humans do, you say what?\n\nGAVIN SCHMIDT: So, you know, science works by putting all the bits of evidence together.\n\nWe have looked for all sorts of different fingerprints of change. We have looked to see whether the warming is caused by oscillations in the ocean, whether it\u2019s caused by changes in the sun or volcanoes or all sorts of different things. But what we find is that the picture that you get when you think about what\u2019s happening with greenhouse gases fits the data, not just at the surface, but in the \u2014 higher up in the atmosphere, in the ocean, in the Arctic, all around.\n\nAnd so we have a fingerprint of change that is associated with human activities, and that fingerprint fits the evidence that we\u2019re seeing in the data.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Separately, Gavin Schmidt, we saw yesterday in the journal \u201cScience\u201d this report that humans, it basically concludes, are causing unprecedented damage to the oceans and to life, to animals\u2019 life in the oceans.\n\nWhen you put that together with the temperature findings, what does that tell you?\n\nGAVIN SCHMIDT: Well, human impact on the planet, with the population that we have and the huge exponential growth in population, we\u2019re having exponentially growing effects on the planet across a whole suite of different metrics, whether it\u2019s ocean acidification, whether it\u2019s overfishing, whether it\u2019s habitat loss, whether it\u2019s deforestation.\n\nAll of the graphs look very similar. It\u2019s flat for a long time and then it shoots up. We\u2019re in that exponential growth phase. And we have to be very, very careful that we don\u2019t exceed our reach and damage systems that can\u2019t be recovered.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Any glimmer of hopefulness in all this?\n\nGAVIN SCHMIDT: Well, I think the glimmer of hopefulness is that we\u2019re having a conversation about that. We\u2019re discussing these things, hopefully in a sustainable manner. We\u2019re talking about ways to mitigate and to adapt to the changes that were coming about.\n\nAnd these kind of conversations that we\u2019re having now help raise awareness and help us make sure that the people who are making decisions are making decisions in the full light of the scientific evidence that we have found.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Gavin Schmidt, who is the director of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies at NASA, we thank you.\n\nGAVIN SCHMIDT: Thank you.", "article_metadata": {"description": "2014 was the hottest year in recorded history, even despite below-average temperatures in the Eastern U.S. Judy Woodruff speaks with Gavin Schmidt of NASA\u2019s Goddard Institute for Space Studies about the human impact on global warming.", "pubdate": 20150116, "og": {"site_name": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "2014 was the hottest year in recorded history, even despite below-average temperatures in the Eastern U.S. Judy Woodruff speaks with Gavin Schmidt of NASA\u2019s Goddard Institute for Space Studies about the human impact on global warming.", "title": "Only a little bit hotter, but 2014 record continues trend", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/HEATING-UP-monitor-oceans.jpg", "url": "http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/little-bit-hotter-2014s-record-temperatures-continue-long-term-trend/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "2014 was the hottest year in recorded history, even despite below-average temperatures in the Eastern U.S. Judy Woodruff speaks with Gavin Schmidt of NASA\u2019s Goddard Institute for Space Studies about the human impact on global warming.", "title": "Only a little bit hotter, but 2014 record continues trend", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/HEATING-UP-monitor-oceans.jpg", "creator": "@newshour", "site": "@newshour", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"app_id": 114150878604116}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newshour", "tag": "NASA"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Climate Change, global warming, Goddard Institute, hottest year, NASA"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdfee\"", "article_summary": "GAVIN SCHMIDT: Well, 2014 was only a little bit different from previous years, but what we\u2019re seeing is a long-term trend that is producing record warm year after record warm year.\nGAVIN SCHMIDT: That\u2019s right.\nBut the underlying trend, the trends that we have seen since the 1970s particularly, that\u2019s being driven, that\u2019s being pushed.\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Gavin Schmidt, who is the director of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies at NASA, we thank you.\nJUDY WOODRUFF: So spell this out a little bit more for us."}
