Those issues include taxes, transportation and bonding projects. One issue that needs serious attention and is yet to be resolved is healthcare.\n\nFor many families, including farmers, especially now with crop prices half of what they were a couple of years ago, healthcare costs can make or break the budget. Not many budgets can absorb what insurance companies imposed on them in 2016 by raising some premiums by 50 percent. Along with the outrageous increase in premiums, we have seen insurance companies raise the deductibles to unprecedented levels. It is not uncommon for a couple in the 55 to 65 age range to see a premium of $10,000, plus facing a deductible of $10,000 combined. The one bright spot in Minnesota is that when the Minnesota Legislature decided to set up its own healthcare exchange in 2013, it opted to keep MinnesotaCare. The Affordable Care Act provided new federal guidelines that stipulated that a person's income would be used to determine the amount of federal assistance one would receive to help with insurance premium costs. The amount of premium assistance would be based upon a taxpayer's income, NOT their assets.\n\nFarmers or small business people and many other hardworking rural Minnesotans who currently are on MinnesotaCare, or may qualify next year for MinnesotaCare, could be thrown out because the outcome of MinnesotaCare availability currently sits in a huge omnibus finance bill that has yet to be finalized by 10 conference committee members of the Minnesota House and the Minnesota Senate.\n\nMinnesota House Representatives and Minnesota Senators are taking very different approaches to healthcare. Last year, the Republican majority in the House tried to get rid of MinnesotaCare, which would have forced those families on MinnesotaCare to buy insurance on the private market, where they would have paid much more to get much less coverage. This year, the Republican House majority voted for an \"asset test\" that would make families with $20,000 in assets ineligible for MinnesotaCare. How would anyone farming or building a small business - which our rural communities depend on - be able to qualify? Should these families be left to fend for themselves and pay thousands of dollars more per year just to line insurance companies' pockets?\n\nThe Senate is showing us another way. They have voted to expand MinnesotaCare and take other positive steps to improve healthcare for people like farmers who are income-challenged and who face the most unaffordable costs on the private insurance market.\n\nThe state has a $900 million surplus that we could use for targeted investments. Throwing low-income farmers and other victims of this \"asset test\" out of MinnesotaCare is not the way to go. MinnesotaCare should be recognized as a bipartisan achievement and the Legislature should approach it that way now more than ever, instead of hacking it apart according to partisan lines. After all, MinnesotaCare was a bipartisan effort signed into law under Republican Governor Arnie Carlson to provide affordable health care to low-income Minnesotans. It is working, and should be kept. Let's keep a close watch in these last days of the legislative session, and make sure our elected leaders are really working for the rural communities they are supposed to serve.\n\n---\n\nPaul Sobocinski is a livestock farmer from Wabasso and works with the Policy Program of the Land Stewardship Project with special emphasis on healthcare.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Local Columns", "description": "Before the end of the Minnesota state legislative session on May 23, there are many legislative issues that need to be addressed."}, "article_summary": "Minnesota House Representatives and Minnesota Senators are taking very different approaches to healthcare.\nThis year, the Republican House majority voted for an \"asset test\" that would make families with $20,000 in assets ineligible for MinnesotaCare.\nOne issue that needs serious attention and is yet to be resolved is healthcare.\nThe Affordable Care Act provided new federal guidelines that stipulated that a person's income would be used to determine the amount of federal assistance one would receive to help with insurance premium costs.\nThe one bright spot in Minnesota is that when the Minnesota Legislature decided to set up its own healthcare exchange in 2013, it opted to keep MinnesotaCare."}
