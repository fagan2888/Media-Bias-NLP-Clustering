About seven pro-lifers stood behind the podium holding signs condemning Planned Parenthood\u2019s taxpayer subsidies. Two men and two women wearing bright orange pinnies that read \u201cPRO-CHOICE CLINIC ESCORTS\u201d stood on the fringes of the press gaggle that had gathered.\n\nLila Rose, Live Action\u2019s founder and president, spoke first, explaining that Planned Parenthood performs 25 percent of all abortions in the United States each year\u2013320,000 of 1.2 million in 2008. She also highlighted the recent Government Accountability Office report finding that over 1,000 healthcare plans covered by Obamacare cover elective abortions.

Rose ignored him, reading calmly from her speech until he finally left a few moments later. The man refused to identify himself to or speak with The Daily Caller.\n\nSpeaking after Rose was Ryan Bomberger, Chief Creative Office of the Radiance Foundation\u2013and a child of rape. \u201cUnintended does not mean unwanted, and certainly does not mean unloved,\u201d he said, retelling the story of his biological mother who carried him to term and offered him up for adoption despite her violent sexual assault. He also talked about the disproportionate effect of abortion on the black community, pointing out, for example, that in New York City more black babies are aborted than born alive.\n\nAs the other speakers\u2013Americans United for Life President Charmaine Yoest, Family Research Council Executive Director Joshua Duggar, Concerned Women for America\u2019s Alison Howard and more\u2013got up and spoke, cars driving by on 16th Street slowed down to get a look at the gathering, some honking and some yelling. (RELATED: Planned Parenthood Has Abortion Quotas, Says Former Clinic Director)\n\nThe speakers also highlighted Planned Parenthood\u2019s repeated cover-ups of underage rape victims, Americans\u2019 widespread opposition to funding abortion with taxpayer dollars and Harry Reid\u2019s blocking of the bipartisan No Taxpayer Funding For Abortion Act, which was introduced to the Senate over 13 months ago. Both Duggar and Yoest placed particular importance on upcoming Senate elections.\n\nDuggar later told TheDC that in the next few weeks he personally will be campaigning for pro-life Senate candidates in Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, Louisiana, North Carolina, Georgia and Alabama.

Live Action\u2019s communications director, Drew Belsky, told TheDC they do not have to coordinate with Planned Parenthood to speak in front of their facility, although they do work with local law enforcement.\n\nThe clinic escorts, he said, are \u201chere regularly,\u201d and their presence Tuesday was unrelated to the press conference. He said that the volunteers are around more frequently this time of year because of the 40 Days for Life campaign, during which faith groups pray and hope to minister outside abortion clinics throughout the country.

Twenty-nine percent of D.C. pregnancies ended in induced abortions in 2011, according to the most recent data available, putting the District well above the national rate of 17 percent.\n\nFollow Tristyn on Twitter.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Tristyn Bloom", "description": "Man yells 'Stop interfering with women's healthcare decisions' over woman speaking", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "An unidentified male passerby took it upon himself to defend women at a pro-life press conference Tuesday--by interrupting the woman who was speaking.
