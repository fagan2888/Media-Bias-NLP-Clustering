And I\u2019m sure there\u2019s one for this as well. So I respect the Pope, I think he\u2019s an incredible leader, but I think it\u2019s better to solve this problem in the political realm.\u201d\n\nBush, who announced his candidacy for US president on Monday, is Catholic but said religion would not guide his leadership on climate change.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t go to mass for economic policy or for things in politics,\u201d he said.\n\nSome opponents of the Pope took to Twitter to express their disapproval.\n\n\u201cRed Pope calls for CULTURAL REVOLUTION.\u2019 Been there, done that,\u201d former energy executive and activist Steve Milloy posted from the Twitter handle @JunkScience, along with a picture of Chinese communist revolutionary Mao Tse-tung.\n\nAfter a draft of the Pope\u2019s speech leaked on Wednesday, the conservative Heartland Institute took issue with the Pope\u2019s declaration that human activity, including the reliance on polluting fossil fuels, is harming the Earth.\n\n\u201cThe Church should speak for the poor, who need cheap, reliable, base-load coal-fired power. Yet Pope Francis has sided with the rich profiteers of doom,\u201d wrote Christopher Monckton, chief policy advisor at the Heartland Institute.\n\nTom Sheahen, a physicist and policy advisor at the Heartland Institute, also said that inexpensive fuels could be leveraged to assist the poor.\n\n\u201cIf the developing countries use fossil fuels for a century or two, thereby lifting themselves out of poverty, that will not subtract from the prosperity of the entire world,\u201d Sheahen said.\n\n\u201cThere will be a better energy source in the future.\u201d\n\nAccording to Marc Morano, the publisher of the denialist website Climate Depot, \u201cthe Vatican\u2019s partnering with the United Nations climate agenda is nothing short of an unholy alliance.\u201d\n\nHe said UN global warming solutions \u201care at odds with most Catholic teachings on issues such as abortion, contraception, overpopulation, and helping the poor nations develop.\u201d\n\n\u201cUltimately, the pope\u2019s views on climate science will do little to alter the opinions of Catholics about global warming.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Pope-Francis-800x430.jpg", "height": 430}, "title": "Former energy executive claims \u2018Red Pope\u2019 is the new Mao as he freaks out over climate encyclical"}, "fb": {"app_id": 212555972273585}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "article_summary": "Yet Pope Francis has sided with the rich profiteers of doom,\u201d wrote Christopher Monckton, chief policy advisor at the Heartland Institute.\n\u201cIf the developing countries use fossil fuels for a century or two, thereby lifting themselves out of poverty, that will not subtract from the prosperity of the entire world,\u201d Sheahen said.\nThe reactions to Pope Francis\u2019 encyclical on climate change ranged from anger to polite disagreement, with US Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush saying he respects the Catholic leader but prefers to make decisions about the environment in the political realm.\n\u201cLook, the climate is changing,\u201d Bush said at a campaign event in Iowa, according to CNN.\n\u201cRed Pope calls for CULTURAL REVOLUTION.\u2019 Been there, done that,\u201d former energy executive and activist Steve Milloy posted from the Twitter handle @JunkScience, along with a picture of Chinese communist revolutionary Mao Tse-tung."}
