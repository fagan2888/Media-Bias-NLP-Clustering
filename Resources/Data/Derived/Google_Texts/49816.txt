A pointed new ad from Hillary Clinton paints the Democratic front-runner as "the one candidate" who can stop the "backward, even dangerous" Republicans running for president.

Titled "Incredible," the 30-second ad released from Hillary for America features a number of clips of GOP candidates making what their critics consider extreme statements about bombing the Islamic State, repealing Obamacare and defunding Planned Parenthood.

The clip also shows an infamous clip of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie angrily telling a heckler to "sit down and shut up" and Donald Trump saying "wages are too high." Not included in the ad is Trump's subsequent explanation that his comment meant minimum wage should not increase.

"One of these Republicans could actually be president, enacting their agenda," the narrator says between the clips. "They're backward, even dangerous. So ask yourself, who is the one candidate who can stop them?"
