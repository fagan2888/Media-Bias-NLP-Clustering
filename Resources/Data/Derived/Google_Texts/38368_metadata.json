It\u2019s a new policy he\u2019s decided on in the fourth quarter of his presidency.\n\nObama listed off his (rhymes with) \u201cbucket list.\u201d\n\n\u201cTake executive action on immigration? Bucket. New climate regulations? Bucket. It\u2019s the right thing to do,\u201d Obama said, picking up on criticism of his executive actions.\n\n2. Anger translator\n\nPerhaps the funniest moment of the night was when Obama called up his \u201canger translator,\u201d Luther \u2014 AKA comedian Keegan-Michael Key.\n\nThe skit saw Obama deliver mellow, politically correct lines as Key \u2014 err, Luther \u2014 sounded off with the unvarnished truth.\n\n\u201cHold on to your lily white butts,\u201d Luther opened.\n\nThe Obama version: \u201cIn our fast changing world, traditions like the White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner are important.\u201d\n\nThe anger translation: \u201cI mean really what is this dinner?\u201d he says jumping emphatically. \u201cAnd why am I required to go to it? Jeb Bush, do you really want to do this?\u201d\n\nObama talking about campaign fundraising: \u201cHillary will have to raise huge sums of money too.\u201d\n\nTranslation: \u201cOh yeah,\u201d Luther says with a wild look in his eyes. \u201cShe goin\u2019 get that money. She goin\u2019 get all the money. Khaleesi is coming to Westeros,\u201d a reference to HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d.\n\nBut taking the script away from his \u201canger translator,\u201d Obama seemed ready to forgo the translation as he began talking about climate change.\n\n\u201cEvery serious scientists says we need act. The Pentagon says it\u2019s a national security risk. Miami floods on a sunny day and instead of doing anything about it, we\u2019ve got elected officials throwing snowballs in the Senate,\u201d Obama said referring to Republican Sen. Jim Inhoffe\u2019s stunt on the Senate floor aimed at disproving global warming.\n\n\u201cO.K. I think I got it bro,\u201d Luther says.\n\n\u201cIt is crazy. What about our kids, what kind of stupid short-sighted, irresponsible, bull \u2014 \u201d Obama continues before being cut off by his \u201ctranslator.\u201d\n\n3. Hillary Clinton\u2019s financial woes\n\nObama\u2019s Clinton joke was almost like a return to Clinton\u2019s comments that she and President Bill Clinton were \u201cdead broke\u201d when they left the White House.\n\nAs Obama noted, \u201cfor many Americans, this is still a time of deep uncertainty.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor example I have one friend, just a few weeks ago she was making millions of dollars a year. And she \u2018s now living out of a van in Iowa,\u201d Obama said in a reference to Clinton\u2019s listening tour in the days and weeks following her campaign announcement.\n\n4. Knocking the 2016ers\n\nObama knocked Ted Cruz as a narcissist after the Texas Republican senator recently compared himself to Galileo for fighting back against climate change:\n\n\u201cGalileo believed the world revolved around the sun. Ted Cruz believes the Earth revolves around Ted Cruz,\u201d Obama joked.\n\nAnd Rick Santorum should stop talking about how he wouldn\u2019t attend a gay marriage, Obama said \u2014 because there\u2019s no way gays and lesbians would even consider inviting him to a same-sex wedding.\n\nAnd for Donald Trump, who is eying a presidential run for the umpteenth time?\n\n\u201cDonald Trump is here. Still,\u201d Obama joked. \u201cAnyway.\u201d\n\nHe also landed a couple jokes at the expense of Democrats considering a run for the White House.\n\n\u201cApparently they really want to see a pot smoking socialist in the White House,\u201d Obama said of Sen. Bernie Sanders, who considers himself a socialist. \u201cWe could get a third Obama term after all.\u201d\n\nAnd on former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley, Obama pulled from Clinton\u2019s recent trip to a Chipotle, where she appeared to try and pass through incognito.\n\n\u201cNot to be outdone, Martin O\u2019Malley kicked things off by going completely unrecognized at a Martin O\u2019Malley campaign event,\u201d Obama quipped.\n\n5. Have no fear\u2026McCain and Biden are here\n\nObama couldn\u2019t deliver jokes at the White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner without discussing one of the stories that has most dogged that group of reporters: the Secret Service.\n\nObama said the agency, which has fumbled time and again in the last year, has come up with a \u201cfool proof way to keep people off my lawn.\u201d\n\nThe answer came in the form of a Photoshopped picture: Sen. John McCain with a broom.\n\nAnd to keep the nagging drones away? Vice President Joe Biden with a baseball bat.\n\n6. Don\u2019t worry Senate Democrats, there\u2019s now Obamacare\n\nThe 2014 midterms were still on Obama\u2019s mind as he touted the benefits of his signature health care law, that helps American get affordable health insurance even if they don\u2019t have a job.\n\n\u201cToday thanks to Obamacare, you no longer have to worry about losing your insurance if you lose your job. You\u2019re welcome Senate Democrats,\u201d Obama said.\n\n7. The classic Biden joke.\n\nNoting that he was feeling \u201cmore loose and relaxed than ever\u201d in the fourth quarter of his presidency, Obama drew back to a too-close-for-comfort moment involving Vice President Joe Biden and Defense Secretary Ash Carter\u2019s wife.\n\n\u201cThose Joe Biden shoulder massages, they\u2019re like magic,\u201d Obama joked. \u201cYou should try one. Oh you have?\u201d\n\nBiden got a little touchy-feely with the newly-minted defense secretary\u2019s wife in February \u2014 apparently giving her a taste of the Obama special.\n\n8. Biden joke #2\n\nObama tried to soften up his blow to Biden \u2014 blows that have become somewhat of a Washington tradition \u2014 by pointing out how much he loves Biden.\n\n\u201cI love that man,\u201d Obama said. \u201cWe\u2019ve gotten so close that some places in Indiana won\u2019t serve us pizza any more,\u201d a reference to Indiana\u2019s recent religious freedom law that angered LGBT rights activists.\n\n9. Boehner, Netanyahu\u2026never gets old.\n\nWhile joking about getting older, Obama joked:\n\n\u201cI look so old [House Speaker] John Boehner\u2019s already invited [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu to speak at my funeral,\u201d Obama joked, referring to the House Speaker\u2019s controversial invitation of the Israeli Prime Minister.\n\n10. Dick Cheney\n\nObama swung back at Vice President Dick Cheney, who recently called Obama \u201cthe worst President of my lifetime.\u201d\n\n\u201cDick Cheney said I was the worst president of his lifetime, which is interesting because I think Dick Cheney is the worst president of my lifetime,\u201d Obama joked of the former vice president, who was considered very influential in the Bush White House.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Washington (CNN) - President Barack Obama had one motto Saturday night at the annual White House Correspondents' Association dinner: take no prisoners.
