(AP) - A weak child pornography law in New Mexico is attracting offenders to the state, officials said.\n\nA 2014 New Mexico Supreme Court ruling limits child porn possession charges to a single count regardless of the number of images involved, the Albuquerque Journal reported (http://bit.ly/1NltTWW ).\n\nSpecial Agent in Charge Anthony Maez, who heads the state attorney general\u2019s Internet Crimes Against Children Unit, said law enforcement has noticed New Mexico\u2019s lax rules being discussed online, and that traffickers in child pornography are moving to the state as a result.\n\n\u201cThese individuals know New Mexico is more lenient than other states,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the consequences don\u2019t outweigh the crime.\u201d\n\nAttorney General Hector Balderas plans to try getting previously failed legislation approved in 2016 to allow a charge to be filed for each image depicting child pornography, as some states do.\n\nThe Internet has given people possessing child pornography a way to spread the images quickly. But Maez says authorities have uncovered sex abuse online that may otherwise have stayed hidden.\n\n\u201cIt does help us identify these individuals,\u201d he said.\n\nMaez said the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children, where most of the task force\u2019s tips come from, has identified over 9,600 victims of child pornography around the world.\n\nAn estimated 5 million children have been affected.\n\n\u201cIt is overwhelming,\u201d Maez said. \u201cWe look at the priority cases first.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Albuquerque Journal, http://www.abqjournal.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "A weak child pornography law in New Mexico is attracting offenders to the state, officials said.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/nov/22/new-mexicos-weak-child-porn-penalties-attract-offe/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "A weak child pornography law in New Mexico is attracting offenders to the state, officials said.", "title": "Officials: New Mexico\u2019s weak child porn law lures offenders"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "description": "A weak child pornography law in New Mexico is attracting offenders to the state, officials said.", "card": "summary", "title": "Officials: New Mexico\u2019s weak child porn law lures offenders"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "SANTA FE, N.M.
