The law is still being challenged. Photo: Lucy Nicholson/Reuters\n\nMajor insurer Highmark Inc. is suing the federal government, arguing it is owed money under the Affordable Care Act, a move that opens yet another front in the continuing legal battles over the 2010 health law.\n\nHighmark, the insurance arm of Pittsburgh-based nonprofit Highmark Health, said in the suit that the U.S. failed to live up to obligations to pay the insurer nearly $223 million owed under an ACA program known as \u201crisk corridors,\u201d which aimed to limit the financial risks borne by insurers entering the new health-law markets. The suit claims \u201cviolations of the mandatory risk-corridor payment obligations prescribed\u201d in the health law.\n\nThe suit is likely to draw close attention because it comes from a company that continues to be a major player in the ACA health-insurance marketplaces in three states. Many other insurers also suffered major shortfalls in risk-corridor payments.\n\n\u201cPublicly traded companies may come under pressure from shareholders to file their own suits,\u201d said Ana Gupte, an analyst with Leerink Partners LLC.\n\nHighmark Health Chief Executive David Holmberg said the company had a fiduciary responsibility to its policyholders to file the suit. \u201cAll we\u2019re asking is for the federal government to do what they promised,\u201d he said.\n\nHighmark Health had a loss of around $85 million last year, on revenue of about $17.7 billion, with the negative result due largely to losses on its ACA-plan business.\n\nThe federal Department of Health and Human Services announced last fall that insurers initially would receive only 12.6% of the money they claimed under the risk-corridor program for 2014, its first year of operation. Highmark is seeking the full amount it says is due to it for that year.\n\nA Health and Human Services spokesman declined to comment on the suit.\n\nThe Highmark suit was filed Tuesday in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, in the District of Columbia. At least one other insurer suit focused on risk-corridor payments has been filed in the same court, by Health Republic Insurance Co. in February, and that suit is seeking class-action status. The court has yet to rule on the substance of the February suit, according to Stephen Swedlow, an attorney representing Health Republic.\n\nThe risk-corridor suits are the latest sign that six years after its passage, the ACA continues to generate intense legal controversy. Just in the past week, a federal court ruled that the Obama administration overstepped its authority in making certain payments under the law without explicit appropriations from Congress, and the Supreme Court sent back to lower courts a case regarding religious employers\u2019 role in covering contraception.\n\nIn its complaint, Highmark argues that the U.S. government is obligated to pay the full amount owed under the risk-corridor program, on an annual basis, under the language of the ACA and because of contracts signed with insurers offering plans through the law\u2019s marketplaces.\n\nAs damages, Highmark is seeking the amount it says it is owed for 2014 under the risk-corridor program, which is approximately $223 million, minus the amount it has been paid so far, which is currently around $27 million. Highmark also is seeking interest and legal expenses.\n\nAt the heart of the suit are the details of the risk-corridor program, which was supposed to help limit insurers\u2019 losses, using payments collected from other insurers that did relatively well on the new ACA business.\n\nHighmark says federal officials initially said these payments would be made in full even if the amount owed was greater than the amount collected from other insurers.\n\nBut later, Highmark\u2019s suit says, federal officials said the program would be \u201cbudget neutral,\u201d meaning that it would pay out only as much as it collected.\n\nLanguage in a 2014 congressional spending bill reinforced this stance.\n\nIn the end, insurers requested approximately $2.87 billion in risk-corridor payments based on their 2014 results.\n\nBut only $362 million came in from other insurers. The Department of Health and Human Services has said that as more money comes into the program in future years, it will be paid out to backfill the shortfall for the 2014 allotment.\n\nHighmark\u2019s suit says agency officials have reiterated that the federal government is obligated to make full risk-corridor payments.\n\nBut that acknowledgment \u201cis an insufficient substitute for full and timely payment of the amounts owed,\u201d the complaint says.\n\nWrite to Anna Wilde Mathews at anna.mathews@wsj.com", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "article.created":
