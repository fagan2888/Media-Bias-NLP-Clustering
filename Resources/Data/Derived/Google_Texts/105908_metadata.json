At first, the document looks almost indistinguishable from the various bureaucratic reporting forms used by the government across the country. But at a closer glance, the irreverent tone of the sheet quickly becomes apparent. The principal purpose of the document is \u201cto assist whiners in documenting hurt feelings.\u201d Various fields to fill out include the \u201cwhiner\u2019s name,\u201d \u201ctype of whine used,\u201d and \u201cname of person who hurt your pansy ass feelings.\u201d\n\nSchool emails \u2018Hurt Feelings Report\u2019 that makes fun of whinershttps://t.co/DMQpu2on7T pic.twitter.com/8mKEggBdN8 \u2014 WGRZ (@WGRZ) February 17, 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe document isn\u2019t a new one, and both it and several close imitators can be found in various locations on the Internet. The form doesn\u2019t appear to be mocking children, but instead whiney employees, as the form is clearly supposed to be filled out by the alleged \u201cwhiner\u201d themselves, and options on the \u201cReasons for filing this report\u201d section include: \u201cTwo beers is not enough\u201d and \u201cThe Dept. needs to fix my problems.\u201d\n\nAt least one parent was unable to take the humor in stride and, ironically, whined to the news about the document.\n\n\u201c[It\u2019s] completely offensive and mocks children who are bullied in schools,\u201d the anonymous parent told The News Journal.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear whether any other parents were genuinely offended, but school officials have still raced to apologize. A recorded message of apology was quickly sent to the phones of all parents, and a corrected email went out by Wednesday night.\n\nThe school said the form had been mistakenly attached by a school employee who received it from \u201ca person external to the school.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis was an embarrassing mistake, but it was just that \u2013 a mistake,\u201d the school said, according to NBC Philadelphia. \u201cIt should not have happened, and we apologize for the error.\u201d\n\nMany parents appear to have taken the accident in stride.\n\n\u201cIf the children didn\u2019t see it, what is the problem?\u201d a father told The News Journal. \u201cIt was a dumb prank, but I don\u2019t think it was malicious.\u201d\n\nSend tips to blake@dailycallernewsfoundation.org.\n\nClick here for reuse options!
