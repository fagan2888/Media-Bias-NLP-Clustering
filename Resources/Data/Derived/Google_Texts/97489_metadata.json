More specifically, it\u2019s about the more than 1.5 million Georgia residents who have no health insurance.\n\nAccording to a recent study by the Kaiser Family Foundation, in only three states is that number higher, and they are all more populous than Georgia. The same study shows Georgia with the third-highest number of uninsured citizens \u2014 again, behind only more highly populated Texas and Florida \u2014 who make too little to qualify for subsidies under the Affordable Care Act and too much to qualify for unexpanded Medicaid. That number, in Georgia, tops 300,000.\n\nThat \u201ccoverage gap\u201d was on the minds of families and advocates who gathered recently in Atlanta to ask legislators to provide better mental health coverage for children and young adults. Many of the latter, anxious (and in at least one case grieving) parents told lawmakers, are in mental health crises with no access to affordable help.\n\nIt was also on the minds of local members of the state House Democratic Caucus who led a recent town meeting in Columbus, making the case for Georgia to join the 31 states that have already expanded Medicaid to insure working families who otherwise cannot afford health coverage.\n\nIt\u2019s an economic and practical as well as a moral issue, House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams, D-Atlanta, told the Columbus audience: \u201cWe have 15 rural hospitals facing ruin if we don\u2019t step up. We have millions of dollars we can generate for this state and thousands of jobs.\u201d\n\nA telling statistic from the Kaiser report: Hospitals in states that expanded Medicaid had an average decrease in uninsured patients of nearly one-third, and a 40 percent decrease in unreimbursed costs for indigent patient care. A different study, this one by Moody\u2019s Investors Service, showed an average of 13 percent less uncollectible debt on unpaid hospital bills last year in Medicaid expansion states.\n\nFor how many struggling rural hospitals might such numbers mean the difference between survival and going under? More to the point, for how many acutely ill and injured people might they mean the difference between life and death?\n\nGeorgians\u2019 critical need for affordable and timely access to health care is a fact, not a \u201ctalking point.\u201d If lawmakers have a better approach than 100 percent federal coverage through 2016 and 90 percent thereafter, let\u2019s hear it. If Georgia has a feds-free formula for saving desperately needed health care facilities and caring for the Georgians who desperately need them, let\u2019s hear it. What we\u2019ve gotten so far is political placebo.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Athens News, Athens Georgia, Athens Banner Herald, Athens, Georgia, Georgia Bulldogs, Dawgs, Bulldogs, Music, UGA, newspaper, 30601, Clarke County, Madison, Oconee, Oglethorpe, Dogs, 30602, 30603, 30604, 30605, Richt, SEC football, Jackson County, R.E.M., Widespread Panic, B-52s, Opinion, Columbus Ledger-Enquirer", "og": {"url": "http://onlineathens.com/opinion/2015-10-29/what-others-say-georgia-lawmakers-should-support-medicaid-expansion-columbus", "site_name": "Online Athens", "type": "article", "title": "What Others Say: Georgia lawmakers should support Medicaid expansion (Columbus Ledger-Enquirer)"}, "description": "OnlineAthens.com is the daily online edition of The Athens (GA) Banner-Herald."}, "article_summary": "If Georgia has a feds-free formula for saving desperately needed health care facilities and caring for the Georgians who desperately need them, let\u2019s hear it.\nThe deciding factor ought to be the needs of millions of Georgians whose interests those lawmakers are sworn to represent.\nMore specifically, it\u2019s about the more than 1.5 million Georgia residents who have no health insurance.\nThe following editorial appeared recently in the Columbus Ledger-Enquirer:At some point, and on some commonsense level, Georgia lawmakers have to get past the idea that the deciding factor in health care policy is the political necessity of publicly loathing Barack Obama.\nA different study, this one by Moody\u2019s Investors Service, showed an average of 13 percent less uncollectible debt on unpaid hospital bills last year in Medicaid expansion states."}
