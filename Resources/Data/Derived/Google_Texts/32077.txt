So, as Mary and John await the day when they activate their higher retirement benefits, they have a $12,000 a year cushion in the form of Mary's spousal benefit. Note that if Mary had been at less than full retirement age but 62 or older, she still could have begun a spousal benefit based on her husband's move to file and suspend, assuming that that benefit would be larger than what she was due on her own work record. However, the spousal payment would have been less than the full 50 percent. And she would be locking in a discounted rate forever, whether for the spousal benefit or her own work record benefits.

File and suspend can also have long-lasting positive effects. For instance, if John were to die at 72, his decision to delay taking his Social Security until 70 will have had a very favorable impact on Mary's survivor benefit. She will receive John's full monthly payment, including his delayed retirement credits.

Q: But isn't it a gamble to put off taking benefits?

A: Yes. You should probably consider file and suspend only if the person suspending is healthy. When John suspends his benefits at 66, he is basically making a bet in favor of longevity. But if he dies at 68, he will have missed out on two years of retirement benefits that he could have collected.

Retirees should review their personal finances carefully to make sure this is best for their particular case. Before suspending benefits, they should make sure they will have enough income to pay their living expenses while they wait for their higher payments in the future. The spousal benefit helps.
