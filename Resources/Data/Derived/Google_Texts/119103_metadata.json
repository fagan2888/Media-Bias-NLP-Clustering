From his prediction of a \u201cvery massive recession\u201d to his description of himself as the \u201cLone Ranger\u201d of American politics trump was, even for him, highly quotable.\n\nBut for people focused on fiscal issues, it was his claim that he would eliminate the federal debt \u2013 not the annual deficit, but the entire outstanding debt of the federal government \u2013 within eight years that really raised some eyebrows.\n\nRelated: GOP Accused of \u2018Stealing Delegates\u2019 to Dump Trump\n\nThe Treasury Department calculates the nation\u2019s federal debt at $19.3 trillion, although it could be as low as $13.9 trillion (if you eliminate debts the government owes itself, like Treasury securities held by the Social Security Trust Fund).\n\nTrump, however, consistently describes the debt as being more than $19 trillion, so when he promises to eliminate the debt within eight years, it\u2019s reasonable to assume that he is referring to the higher figure, which will be approaching $20 trillion by the time the next president takes office.\n\nThe reaction most people familiar with government spending and borrowing had to Trump\u2019s promise was that it is utterly delusional.\n\nFirst off, the annual US Gross Domestic Product is just under $18 trillion. Second, US government spending last year was $3.7 trillion. The idea that there is $2.4 trillion per year in excess funds lying around that the Treasury could use to pay down the debt over 8 years strains the imagination.\n\nRelated: Cruz Could Win Big in Wisconsin as Trump\u2019s Numbers Drop\n\nWhen Woodward and Costa pressed him on the issue, Trump promised that the difference would be made up in the form of better trade deals and economic growth. \u201cI\u2019m renegotiating all of our deals, the big trade deals that we\u2019re doing so badly on,\u201d he said.\n\nThe idea that the US can retire an economy-sized debt load in 8 years based on renegotiated trade deals and the few vague spending cuts Trump has hinted as is plainly absurd. So, on Sunday, Trump senior advisor Barry Bennett explained to NBC that the solution will be a massive sell-off of the 77,000 unused Federal buildings, property, and mineral rights. In 2014, NPR reported that the Office of Management and Budget estimated the annual cost of maintaining these buildings at $1.7 billion a year.\n\n\u201cThe United States government owns more real estate than anybody else, more land than anybody else, more energy than anybody else,\u201d Bennett said in an interview with NBC affiliate MSNBC. \u201cWe can get rid of government buildings we're not using, we can extract the energy from government lands, we can do all kinds of things to extract value from the assets that we hold.\u201d\n\nRelated: More Legal Trouble for Team Trump as Protesters File Suit\n\nHow much federal government lands and other holdings are worth are an open question. It\u2019s still another question what they would be worth in the sort of fire sale Trump is apparently suggesting.\n\nAnd yet another question is where that kind of money would come from. The idea that there is $19 trillion of uncommitted investment capital just hanging around in the US, waiting for federal lands and buildings to come on the market seems\u2026a bit of a stretch.\n\nThere is, of course, a wide world of investors out there, many of whom would be more than happy to take title to\u2026who knows\u2026Yellowstone Park? But it\u2019s not obvious that Trump, who has made blocking some immigrants from even entering the US, actually wants to be the president who sells off the country, piecemeal, to foreign investors.\n\nLike his rapidly rotating stances on the abortion issue this week, it seems safe to expect that The Donald\u2019s position on the federal debt will be changing in the coming days as well.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Donald Trump\u2019s plan to eliminate the entire federal debt in the space of 8 years looked a little crazy before his people started explaining it.
