Last season the Tampa Bay Buccaneers were last in the NFL in this statistic at 5.0 yards per pass play, 61% better than Manning's preseason number.\n\nThe NFL average in 2013 was 6.2, twice Manning's current average, according to Pro Football Reference. But Manning has fallen below that mark in each of the last five summers. In 2011, he averaged 5.6 yards per pass play in the preseason, then boosted it to 7.7 in the regular season, the fifth-best mark in the NFL. He finished that season as the Super Bowl MVP.\n\nManning's subpar pass protection is a major concern, especially with guard Geoff Schwartz out indefinitely with a toe injury.\n\nManning has been an expert at avoiding sacks throughout his career, having been dumped just 252 times on 5,008 pass attempts, the sixth-best sack rate among active quarterbacks (minimum 1,000 attempts).\n\nBut this preseason, Manning has been sacked five times on just 37 attempts, losing 57 yards in the process.\n\nIn addition to the line's faltering, Manning seems hesitant to throw the ball away, after his having misfired for a league-worst 27 interceptions last year.\n\nClearly needing more time to master Ben McAdoo's new West Coast offense, Manning and the other starters are expected to play a series or two in the preseason finale Thursday against New England.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "article.created": "2014-08-26T00:51:00.000Z", "article.section": "New York", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "Article", "twitter": {"domain": "wsj.com", "description": "Poor play in the preseason in nothing new to Manning and Giants, and it doesn't matter once the games start to count.
