Bloomberg News\n\nFederal Reserve Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer said Friday U.S. inflation is still too weak and the central bank must ensure it moves up gradually to its 2% target.\n\nDuring a question-and-answer session at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Mr. Fischer said he never thought he would encounter this problem as a policy maker, since for much of the last few decades any worries about inflation tended to be about prices picking up too quickly.\n\n\u201cInflation is too low, we need to get it back up to 2%,\u201d Mr. Fischer said in response to questions from Chamber of Commerce head Tom Donohue. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re keeping interest rates low, to encourage investment\u201d and growth, he said.\n\nMr. Fischer pushed back against Wall Street criticisms of financial regulation, saying the financial crisis proved the rules of the road were too lax and banks were far too reliant on debt, making them fragile and vulnerable to shocks.\n\nHe said bank stress tests are a key innovation in bank supervision that has helped policy makers get a grip on a complex and highly interconnected financial system.\n\nAsked about the Fed\u2019s emergency lending powers, which are currently under attack by some lawmakers on Capitol Hill, Mr. Fischer said the lender of last resort function is a basic tenet of central banking.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to throw away things that could be very useful,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer said U.S. inflation is still too weak and the central bank must ensure it moves up gradually to its 2% target.", "title": "Fed\u2019s Fischer Says U.S. Inflation Still Too Low", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2015/07/17/feds-fischer-says-u-s-inflation-still-too-low/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-JL195_0717fi_P_20150717111244.jpg"}, "site": "WSJecon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Economy", "article.headline": "Fed\u2019s Fischer Says U.S. Inflation Still Too Low", "description": "Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer said U.S. inflation is still too weak and the central bank must ensure it moves up gradually to its 2% target.", "article_section": "Economy", "author": "Pedro Nicolaci da Costa", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Real Time Economics Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Real Time Economics", "article.summary": "Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer said U.S. inflation is still too weak and the central bank must ensure it moves up gradually to its 2% target.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2015-07-17T15:07:16-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-138", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2015/07/17/feds-fischer-says-u-s-inflation-still-too-low/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-REB-33560", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Economy", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer said U.S. inflation is still too weak and the central bank must ensure it moves up gradually to its 2% target.", "title": "Fed\u2019s Fischer Says U.S. Inflation Still Too Low", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2015/07/17/feds-fischer-says-u-s-inflation-still-too-low/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-JL195_0717fi_P_20150717111244.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Real Time Economics", "article.id": "BL-REB-33560", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-07-17T15:18:40-04:00"}, "article_summary": "\u201cInflation is too low, we need to get it back up to 2%,\u201d Mr. Fischer said in response to questions from Chamber of Commerce head Tom Donohue.\nStanley Fischer, vice chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve, speaking in New York in March.\nBloomberg NewsFederal Reserve Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer said Friday U.S. inflation is still too weak and the central bank must ensure it moves up gradually to its 2% target.\nAsked about the Fed\u2019s emergency lending powers, which are currently under attack by some lawmakers on Capitol Hill, Mr. Fischer said the lender of last resort function is a basic tenet of central banking.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re keeping interest rates low, to encourage investment\u201d and growth, he said."}
