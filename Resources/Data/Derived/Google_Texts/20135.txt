Congressman Trey Gowdy (R., S.C.) said the series of embarrassing statements from Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber should continue to flow uninterrupted because they reveal the true deceptive nature of President Obama’s unpopular health care law.

“When you have an insomniac with Tourette’s syndrome, you don’t interrupt him,” Gowdy told Fox’s Greta Van Susteren on Wednesday. “So we’re going to let him keep talking, as long as he will talk.”

Gowdy said Gruber’s admission that “lack of transparency” helped push Obamacare through Congress should trigger a congressional investigation on the nearly $2 million Gruber received from U.S. taxpayers during the course of his employment as an advisor to the Obama administration.

“Then when he’s through insulting our fellow citizens…I would love to ask him, ‘when you apologized, did you apologize because you said it, or did you apologize because you meant it?'” Gowdy said. “I think he meant that we could not have passed this bill if people had been paying attention.”

When Van Susteren pointed out that Gruber had knowingly “undermined the democratic system by being deceitful,” Gowdy responded with a sarcastic swipe at Gruber’s academic arrogance.

“But, Greta, when somebody is so much smarter than we are, and knows so much better what’s in our best interest, and they happen to have a Ph.D. behind their name, it’s okay when they lie to us, because they have our best interest in mind, and you and I are just not smart enough to know what is best for us,” Gowdy said. “If I could get past the irony, I would get to the arrogance. But this ‘transparent’ administration can’t tell you the truth about its signature piece of legislation. That irony is just rich to me.”
