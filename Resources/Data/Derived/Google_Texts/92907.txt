GLENEAGLES, Scotland — Two years after the “Miracle of Medinah,” it’s not just the Americans seeking redemption at the Ryder Cup.

Graeme McDowell holed the winning putt for Europe at Celtic Manor in 2010 but was a peripheral figure in Medinah, earning one point from four matches as his partnership with Rory McIlroy struggled.

Europe’s come-from-behind victory, from 10-5 down at one stage on Saturday evening, has gone down in lore but it was tinged with disappointment for the Northern Irishman.

“I was low on energy,” McDowell said, “I was physically not where I needed to be and that became evident as the week went on.”

He has been desperate to make amends ever since.

McDowell has experienced it all at the Ryder Cup — the first shot (2012), the last shot (‘10) and everything in between.

But the man who says he “embraces high-pressure scenarios” took a backward step in the singles at Medinah, placing himself in the middle of the draw on the Sunday and losing 2 and 1 to Zach Johnson.

“Perhaps I needed that little bit of intensity of the last groups,” he said. “Perhaps come Sunday, if it’s needed, I will put myself a little bit further down the order and ask the question of myself and focus my mind again.”

McDowell isn’t short of galvanizing influences. A month ago, his wife, Kristin, gave birth to their first child, Vale Esme, and McDowell tied for 36th in his only tournament since — the BMW Championship in Colorado.

He is counting on a “delayed nappy (diaper) effect” kicking in for his fourth straight Ryder Cup at Gleneagles.

“By the time I got to Denver, I actually experienced a little bit of a flat, a little bit of a downer,” McDowell said. “But I’ve come to terms with that, I’ve come to terms with the fact that sleeping is done, is gone forever. And I arrive here this week feeling fresh and ready to go.”
