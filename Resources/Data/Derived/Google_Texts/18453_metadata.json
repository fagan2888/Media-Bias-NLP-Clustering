If people knew the benefits of breastfeeding over formula feeding they would probably have better opinions,\" said Sara Hyland a breastfeeding peer councilor.\n\nWhether women do it to save money, or to improve their baby's health, the Ionia County Health Department tells us that nursing protects babies from illnesses like diarrhea and allergies, all while contributing to your baby's growth.\n\nWhen it comes to mother's health, experts say there's a decreased risk of breast and ovarian cancer in nursing women, that it can burn up to 500 calories a day, and it can cut major costs.\n\nWith the Affordable Care Act, federal law states women at work must be granted time to 'express' their milk for one year after the child's birth every time they need to, and in a place other than a bathroom that people can't see.\n\nGovernor Rick Snyder even signing a law last year, protecting those mothers from discrimination if they choose to breastfeed in public.\n\nBut many mothers face barriers when it comes to breastfeeding, whether it's not having the time, or simply being afraid.\n\n\"It's hard when you come from a community where it's not the normal thing and you don't see moms breastfeeding,\" said local Dula, Kelsey Ingvartsen.\n\n\"My first son I didn't breastfeed, I breastfed him for six weeks and stopped because I didn't have support and I didn't know where to look,\" Ingvartsen said.\n\nThe Ionia County Health Department says those concerns could fade if women had more support.\n\n\"To have people around them say you're doing a good job, that's so important for a mom to hear especially in those early days,\" said Laurie Brinks a Certified Lactation Councilor.\n\nThe CDC suggests breastfeeding exclusively for the first six months of life, then up to a year with baby food blended in.\n\nThe Ionia County Health Department has a Certified Lactation Counselor and a Breastfeeding Peer Counselor on staff to support anyone who might have questions about breast feeding, you can call them at (616) 527-5341.", "article_metadata": {"description": "IONIA COUNTY, Mich.-- Not only is this week National Breastfeeding Week, Governor Snyder declared August as\u00a0Breastfeeding Awareness Month.
