Talks are underway to decide how best to care for them.\n\nIn addition, the equation could change if a federal court injunction is lifted on President Barack Obama\u2019s executive order offering citizenship to some of these people, Coleman noted. The Supreme Court in January agreed to hear the case.\n\nIf the injunction is lifted, some of the kids in California could be eligible for citizenship under Obama\u2019s order.\n\nAssuming they qualified, they would be covered under regular Medi-Cal, which gets significant funding from the federal government, thus reducing the state\u2019s bill for their care.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Advocates and experts say the state has undercounted the number of eligible children -- more kids in the program would mean higher costs.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"State's Medi-Cal Bill for Undocumented Children Could Go Up\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2016\\/02\\/09\\/states-medi-cal-bill-for-undocumented-children-could-go-up\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2016-02-09 11:09:03\",\"mod_date\":\"2016-02-09 11:10:08\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":146061,\"author_id\":\"8344\",\"author_name\":\"State of Health\",\"author_display_name\":\"State of Health\",\"tags\":[\"Children's Health\",\"Medi-Cal\",\"News\",\"Undocumented Immigrants\"],\"categories\":[\"Community Health\",\"Policy\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2015\\/04\\/RS1369_IMG_1902-e1429575505514.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "Advocates and experts say the state has undercounted the number of eligible children -- more kids in the program would mean higher costs.", "title": "State\u2019s Medi-Cal Bill for Undocumented Children Could Go Up", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2016/02/09/states-medi-cal-bill-for-undocumented-children-could-go-up/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2015/04/RS1369_IMG_1902-e1429575505514-1440x1080.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "children\\'s health,medi-cal,news,undocumented immigrants", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5c71\"", "article_summary": "The cost of providing full Medi-Cal benefits to undocumented immigrant children in California could be significantly more than the state\u2019s health care agency has projected, according to experts and advocates.\nBut some advocates believe the number of eligible kids \u2013 and thus the price of covering them \u2013 will be much higher.\nAssuming they qualified, they would be covered under regular Medi-Cal, which gets significant funding from the federal government, thus reducing the state\u2019s bill for their care.\nMost of the 170,000 eligible children included in the state\u2019s estimate \u201cdon\u2019t have any care at all right now, outside of some of them getting care in the ER,\u201d Diel explained.\nBut the state\u2019s eligibility numbers could be off by even more than 90,000, said Richard Figueroa, program director at the California Endowment, a health care philanthropy."}
