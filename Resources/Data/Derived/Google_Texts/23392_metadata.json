The reaction was fast and furious with former presidential advisor David Axelrod tweeting, \u201cWith the Senate seriously at risk, and the Koch Brothers spending prodigiously, shouldn\u2019t Dem funders be focused on \u201914 and not \u201916 races?\u201d\n\nThe uproar shed light on the undercurrent of suspicion and distrust between the Obama and Clinton camps. Priorities USA was founded in 2011 as an Obama super PAC and retooled late last year to back Clinton. Clinton looks like a shoo-in for \u201916 while Democrats need all the help they can get to survive in red states carried by Mitt Romney. If Republicans win the six seats they need to control the senate, that would sour President Obama\u2019s final two years in office.\n\nAnything that looks like the Clinton forces cannibalizing donor money to stockpile for \u201916 instead of backing Democratic candidates in \u201914 does not sit well with the Obama side of the divide. But Bill Burton tells the Daily Beast it\u2019s more complicated than that. A former White House deputy press secretary and co-founder of Priorities USA, Burton remains informally connected with the organization now that it has switched over to Hillaryland. The Buzzfeed tweet that sparked the controversy \u201cwas read as not doing anything to help Democrats in 2014,\u201d says Burton. But that\u2019s a misnomer. \u201cThey\u2019re still partnering with other organizations and helping Democrats out across the board,\u201d he says, citing Ed Markey\u2019s (Senate) race in Massachusetts, Alex Sink\u2019s (Congress) in Florida, along with Planned Parenthood and Emily\u2019s List.\n\nPriorities USA relies on a relatively small number of high-dollar donors, and they\u2019re asking these contributors to defer giving them really big checks until after the midterms so the money can go to that effort first. Jim Kessler with Third Way, a centrist Democratic group, describes it as \u201cgetting out of the way\u2026more service than hindrance.\u201d\n\nThat jibes with what Burton says. \u201cPeople who have been involved in democratic politics know that donor confusion is your biggest enemy,\u201d he says. The Democrats\u2019 2012 fundraising was successful because everyone stayed in their lanes, he explains, citing the House and Senate super PACs focusing on Congress, American Bridge providing research and tracking, and Priorities USA, which raised 65 million for Obama\u2019s reelection.\n\nThe array of super PACs doesn\u2019t quiet Democrats\u2019 anxiety about being outspent by the Koch brothers, whose primary organization, Americans for Prosperity, spent $25 million in the last six months on ads assailing red state Democrats for their votes on Obamacare, the earliest start in memory for such a targeted effort. When I asked Axelrod to elaborate on his original tweet, this is what he wrote in an e-mail: \u201cMy Tweet wasn\u2019t aimed at any one group or people in particular. It was rooted in my sense that the Senate is very much in play, and D groups and funders should be focused on that, because the Koch Brothers and Republican establishment surely are.\u201d\n\nJustin Barasky, press secretary at the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, points out that the DSCC and other campaign committees are consistently out raising their Republican counterparts, but that doesn\u2019t take into account the array of outside groups, like the Koch Brother-funded campaign vehicles. What\u2019s happening now on the Democratic side is the brutal and necessary process of triage. \u201cNot even the most diehard optimists believe the House is within reach for the Democrats,\u201d says Bill Galston, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and former Clinton domestic policy advisor. House Democrats that survived the 2010 midterms, which restored the GOP to power, are a hardy bunch, \u201cand you can make a pretty rational argument about not pouring a lot of money into House races,\u201d he says.\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, the senate is very much in play and control will likely turn on hard fought close contests in half a dozen states. \u201cSo the stakes are higher and the difference an investment at the margins could make is significant,\u201d says Galston, who fully expects Democratic donors to do their part once the threat becomes clearer and key races are fully engaged. Hollywood executive Jeffrey Katzenberg, one of Priorities USA\u2019s major backers, has already raised a million dollars for Alison Lundergan Grimes, who is challenging Republican leader Mitch McConnell.\n\nThe emotions of Democrats are on a tripwire, ready to react at the slightest provocation. They\u2019ve seen the price Obama paid for his lackluster effort during the lead up to the 2010 midterms. Many remember 1994 when the Republicans won both House and senate from the Democrats, casting President Clinton into a months-long funk until he figured out how to work with newly installed House Speaker Newt Gingrich.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "eleanorclift"}, "keywords": "Hillary Clinton, u.s. poli", "publicationDate": 201402111045, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "description": "A super PAC is giving up on midterm elections to focus its fundraising efforts on Clinton in 2016, which is causing confusion and outrage in Washington.", "pageNum": 1, "title": "Is Hillary Ditching Senate Dems?", "tags": "entity:person/hillary_clinton,topic:politics", "environment": "dev", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "type": "house", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Is Hillary Ditching Senate Dems?\",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/02/10/is-hillary-ditching-senate-dems.html\",\"image_url\":\"http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/02/10/is-hillary-ditching-senate-dems/jcr:content/image.crop.410.273.jpg/46403899.cached.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/02/10/is-hillary-ditching-senate-dems\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-02-11T10:45:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"Politics\",\"author\":\"Eleanor Clift\",\"tags\":[\"hillary_clinton\",\"politics\"]}", "news_keywords": "Hillary Clinton, US Politics", "sectionTaxanomies": "politics", "fb": {"admins": "1703087,30000737,1117577220,1276800108,931159,514915512", "app_id": 189930913679}, "authors": "Eleanor Clift", "article": {"section": "politics", "published_time": "2014-02-11T10:45:00.000Z", "author": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/eleanor-clifthtml"}, "resourceType": "dailybeast2/components/pages/article", "contentpath": "/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/02/10/is-hillary-ditching-senate-dems", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "A super PAC is giving up on midterm elections to focus its fundraising efforts on Clinton in 2016, which is causing confusion and outrage in Washington.", "title": "Is Hillary Ditching Senate Dems?", "url": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/02/10/is-hillary-ditching-senate-dems.html", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/02/10/is-hillary-ditching-senate-dems/jcr:content/image.img.2000.jpg/1392116973391.cached.jpg", "type": "article"}, "authorIds": "/etc/authors/e/eleanor-clift", "content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcadef\"", "article_summary": "Priorities USA was founded in 2011 as an Obama super PAC and retooled late last year to back Clinton.\nIf Republicans win the six seats they need to control the senate, that would sour President Obama\u2019s final two years in office.\nThe news broke in a tweet late Friday afternoon that Priorities USA would be focusing on Hillary Clinton in 2016, and wouldn\u2019t be raising money for Democrats in the upcoming 2014 midterms.\nA former White House deputy press secretary and co-founder of Priorities USA, Burton remains informally connected with the organization now that it has switched over to Hillaryland.\nOn the other hand, the senate is very much in play and control will likely turn on hard fought close contests in half a dozen states."}
