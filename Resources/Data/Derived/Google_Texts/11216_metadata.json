But under the Affordable Care Act, insurers can no longer screen out such people and Frost now is getting insurance through the Association of Washington Business\u2019 Health Choice.\n\n\u201cI never dreamed in my life time that we\u2019d see a time when insurance companies couldn\u2019t turn you away,\u201d Goetz said. \u201cIt\u2019s so heavily ingrained, or it was, into the system.\u201d\n\nUnder the company\u2019s new plan from Premera Blue Cross, its premiums decreased to between $150 and $360 per employee per month, and Frost is picking up 75 percent of the costs. Its deductible has quadrupled to $2,000 since the business opened in 2009.\n\nSteve Burkholder\n\nFor most of its 20 years, Screamer has provided health-insurance benefits to workers who qualify, which right now is three of its six employees.\n\nThe company, which sells ski hats online, is using a new trust this year called Evergreen Security Trust, because the trust it used before had folded.\n\nIt kept the same carrier, Regence BlueShield, and the same plan, but the rates increased about 10 percent to more than $800 per person per month.\n\nAt nearly $2,600 in total a month, \u201cI\u2019m paying more in health insurance than I\u2019m paying in rent,\u201d Burkholder said.\n\nIt makes the notion of bringing on any new employees daunting, given that they could cost $10,000 per year in health benefits alone.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a real serious discussion as to whether we can take that kind of a hit,\u201d Burkholder said.\n\nAnne-Marie Faiola\n\nBramble Berry, a soap-making supplier, provides health insurance to 43 of its 70 employees who work 30 hours a week or more.\n\nLast year, the company was insured through a trust, but now it\u2019s saving money by shopping directly from its carrier, Group Health Cooperative.\n\nBy going direct, it shaved a looming double-digit premium hike to 7.5 percent. But deductibles rose by 25 percent, and the network of doctors and clinics available is narrower outside of the trust.\n\nBesides the higher costs and shrinking benefits, what really frustrated Faiola was the time she burned meeting with her broker and employees to weigh the trade-offs for the different plans.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be dealing with health care and dealing with insurance,\u201d Faiola said. \u201cI\u2019m an employer. I want to create jobs. This is not a good use of my time. That doesn\u2019t help the economy.\u201d\n\nFred Swanson\n\nBased on health questionnaires employees completed, most insurance companies in past years wouldn\u2019t cover Gay City Health Project, a nonprofit promoting LGBT health.\n\nOnly Group Health Cooperative offered coverage, which Swanson said worked for most employees.\n\nBut Group Health\u2019s rates rose dramatically this year for the organization\u2019s 11 employees, so the nonprofit turned to the Washington Healthplanfinder.\n\nThe individual insurance plans on Healthplanfinder exchange cost less than group coverage \u2014 even without the federal tax breaks available to low-income residents.\n\nGay City is reimbursing employees for their premium costs.\n\nSwanson said employees found the exchange relatively easy to use, and a trained enrollment expert, or navigator, could help anyone who ran in to problems.\n\n\u201cIt was great. People were able to choose what they wanted,\u201d Swanson said. \u201cIt kept our costs in check.\u201d\n\nVici Hall\n\nGeneral accounting manager of Summit Power Group, Seattle\n\nTo recruit the talent it needs, it\u2019s imperative that Summit Power Group, an energy-projects developer, offers health insurance to its 38 employees and their families. For 2014 the employer was able to stay with its existing trust, called Business Health Trust. Its insurance carrier changed from Regence to Premera.\n\n\u201cThe coverage we were able to offer was very similar,\u201d Hall said. \u201cIt was pretty seamless.\u201d\n\nThe best news was that its rates increased only by a modest 4 percent.\n\nIt\u2019s still not cheap. Summit pays the entire premium for employees who select a more basic plan, which costs about $480 a month. The company pays 75 percent of a spouse\u2019s premium and 50 percent for kids. Employees who want a plan with better benefits pay an additional $34 a month of their own money.\n\nIn total, insurance for Summit employees and families costs nearly $400,000 annually, with $75,000 of that from employees.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Paul Goetz Co-owner of Frost Doughnuts, Mill Creek Many of Frost Doughnuts&rsquo; 20 workers are part time or high-school age, but the growing business is providing insurance for six employees....", "og": {"site_name": "The Seattle Times", "description": "Paul Goetz Co-owner of Frost Doughnuts, Mill Creek Many of Frost Doughnuts&rsquo; 20 workers are part time or high-school age, but the growing business is providing insurance for six employees.
