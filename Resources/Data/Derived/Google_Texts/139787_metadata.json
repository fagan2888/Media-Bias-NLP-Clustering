They thought it was just a coat and a toy.\"\n\n\n\nA surprise that had one lady in tears.\n\n\n\n\"We had a lady come in earlier who was crying, and she said 'I didn't expect this. I thought when I showed up I was just going to get a coat and I get everything else.' So, it was kind of heartwarming,\" said an event volunteer, Rhonda Bullmaster.\n\n\n\nThis event helped more than 60 families in the community.\n\nCopyright 2016 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc.
