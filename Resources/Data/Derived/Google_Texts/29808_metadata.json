It is not generally the sort of question one would hope to hear from a member of Congress, let alone by the chairman of a House committee during a public committee hearing. Yet that is what House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Darrell Issa, R-Calif., asked embattled health care consultant Jonathan Gruber on Tuesday. Issa added, \u201cDoes MIT employ stupid people?\u201d\n\nGruber, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, answered Issa's first question, \u201cI don\u2019t think so, no.\" And to Issa's follow-up, he replied, \"Not to my knowledge.\u201d\n\n\n\n[READ: Jonathan Gruber Stirs Up the Obamacare Debate Again]\n\nThis was an embarrassing display all the way around.

There was an aggravating factor Tuesday as well \u2013 while the House was playing a game of gotcha, the Senate was discussing a very serious oversight report on the very serious issue of CIA torture after 9/11. The report is over 6,000 pages long, the product of years of work and the examination of millions of documents. The declassified executive summary was more than 500 pages. There was intense debate and discussion about whether the report should have been made public, but at no time did a senator from either party, or on either side of the debate, ask if the other side was \u201cstupid.\u201d\n\n\n\n[SEE: Editorial Cartoons on Obamacare]", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "title": "Darell Issa and Jonathan Gruber's Stupid House Oversight Hearing", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "The House GOP's latest Obamacare hearing was pure theatrics and a big waste of time.", "title": "No More Stupid Questions", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/susan-milligan/2014/12/10/darell-issa-and-jonathan-grubers-stupid-house-oversight-hearing", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/1a/c0/1f9dc55843b8aa894eb0977b0970/141209-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The House GOP's latest Obamacare hearing was pure theatrics and a big waste of time.", "site": "@USNews", "card": "summary", "title": "Darell Issa and Jonathan Gruber's Stupid House Oversight Hearing"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "opinion", "date_published": "Dec. 10, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Susan Milligan,Congress,House of Representatives,Issa, Darrell,Affordable Care Act,health care reform,Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "The House GOP's latest Obamacare hearing was pure theatrics and a big waste of time."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb796\"", "article_summary": "Yet that is what House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Darrell Issa, R-Calif., asked embattled health care consultant Jonathan Gruber on Tuesday.\nIt is not generally the sort of question one would hope to hear from a member of Congress, let alone by the chairman of a House committee during a public committee hearing.\nIssa added, \u201cDoes MIT employ stupid people?\u201dGruber, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, answered Issa's first question, \u201cI don\u2019t think so, no.\"\nThere was an aggravating factor Tuesday as well \u2013 while the House was playing a game of gotcha, the Senate was discussing a very serious oversight report on the very serious issue of CIA torture after 9/11.\nThe report is over 6,000 pages long, the product of years of work and the examination of millions of documents."}
