We eat dinner together. We gather in the living room and watch movies. Last weekend, we went on a camping trip and sat around the campfire making s\u2019mores, the grown-ups enjoying a few beers while my 9-year-old daughter challenged us with endless rounds of \u201cwould you rather?\u201d It all feels so wonderfully mundane that sometimes I have to remind myself that most people view us as strange at best, depraved at worst.\n\nI\u2019m polyamorous, which means I believe you can love multiple partners at the same time. I\u2019m in a relationship with my husband of nearly 17 years, and my boyfriend, with whom I celebrated my second anniversary in May. (In polyamorous lingo, our relationship is known as a \u201cV\u201d; I\u2019m the \u201chinge\u201d of the V and my two partners are the vertices.) People often say our lives sound complicated, but the truth is, we\u2019re quite harmonious. We often joke that we\u2019d make incredibly boring subjects for reality TV.\n\nThat hasn\u2019t kept the world at large from condemning us. The right has spent years warning that we are the travesty waiting down the slippery slope of same-sex marriage. With every stride forward for marriage equality, I can count on turning on the TV to find conservative talking heads lumping families like mine in with pedophilia and bestiality. But liberals, for the most part, don\u2019t treat us much better. They\u2019re quick to insist that same-sex marriage would never, ever lead to such awful things \u2014 failing to point out how multi-partner relationships between consenting adults do not exactly belong in the same category as \u201crelationships\u201d with children or goats.\n\nEven people who don\u2019t vilify us still have a great deal of misconception. Aren\u2019t you just \u201chaving your cake and eating it too,\u201d they ask me? Isn\u2019t this unfair to the men? Doesn\u2019t this hurt your daughter? The confusion is understandable. Many people have never seen a polyamorous family like ours before. So let me explain how it works \u2014 or, at least, how it works for us.\n\nMy path here was a long one. As far back as I can remember, I felt that loving one person romantically did not preclude the possibility of loving another at the same time. It seemed natural and intuitive to me. But I had no models for that way of living, so I assumed there was something wrong with me.\n\nI married my husband and remained in a monogamous relationship with him for many years. I knew I wanted to be with him for the long haul. But I was never entirely fulfilled. I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that some part of me was repressed.\n\nWhen I learned about polyamorous relationships, I knew that\u2019s what I wanted. My husband wasn\u2019t so sure, though. It sounded fine for other people, but just not him. And it still seemed unrealistic to me, so I never pressed the issue.\n\nWhen I returned to school to finish my bachelor\u2019s degree in my late 20s, I became friends with a man who changed my mind about all that. He believed in polyamory, too, and we had long conversations about it together: how it could work, how it was truly possible.\n\nOne night, I sat down with my husband and spilled everything. I told him that being polyamorous was a part of who I am, and I asked if he would at least do some research and give it serious consideration before dismissing the idea. He understood that I never would have asked this if it hadn\u2019t been extremely important.\n\nThat conversation could have ended our marriage. But instead, our journey into non-monogamy began.\n\nOne of the biggest hurdles in non-monogamy \u2014 probably the hurdle \u2014 is jealousy. My husband was an incredibly jealous person back then, but he began to question its usefulness and purpose. Jealousy is born from a fear of losing a partner; if you believe that love and intimacy can be shared, and are not diminished by sharing, then that fear loses a lot of its power. It was liberating for my husband to step outside of the box that saw everyone else as some kind of threat.\n\nOnce he became comfortable with the idea, I began dating my friend from school. Those early days were not without challenges. Choosing to be polyamorous doesn\u2019t mean you instantly flip a switch that extinguishes all jealousy. But it does mean that we seek to understand why we\u2019re feeling insecure. Rather than saying, \u201cYou can\u2019t do this with this other person,\u201d we try to pinpoint what\u2019s missing from our own relationship. We say things like, \u201cI\u2019m having a hard time, and I could really use some quality one-on-one time with you right now.\u201d Being able to ask for what you need \u2014 rather than direct negativity at a partner\u2019s other relationship \u2014 is vital in a polyamorous relationship. Opening ourselves up in this way was a revelation for my husband and me. We became more connected with each other than we\u2019d been in years.\n\nThat first romantic relationship of mine only lasted 10 months (though he remains one of my closest friends). Afterward, I didn\u2019t actively seek another partner. I was hurting from the breakup and not in any rush to put my feelings on the line again. Still, I was happy knowing I had that freedom when the right person came along.\n\nEventually, he did. My boyfriend and I met through our leftist politics. We were members of the same organization. We built a friendship over a period of months, often sitting up talking until sunrise on my back porch. He hadn\u2019t been familiar with polyamory before, though he said the idea made sense to him immediately. I knew I was falling for him, and suspected he felt the same, but I was uncertain whether he would want to be in a polyamorous relationship. After we finally kissed for the first time, I forced myself to have an upfront conversation. Because polyamory don\u2019t rely on familiar social scripts, it\u2019s crucial to spell out terms and expectations rather than relying on assumptions. I needed him to know I wanted a real relationship, not something casual on the side. He told me he wanted exactly the same thing.\n\nFrom the beginning, I was aware that this relationship was different from my previous one. My boyfriend introduced me to his family, something my ex had never done. We spent a great deal of time together, and within months I knew I was falling in love. I hadn\u2019t experienced that kind of emotional intensity since my husband and I were teenagers. Feeling that same surge so many years later made me freshly aware that my husband was the only other person I had really ever been in love with before.\n\nMy husband liked my boyfriend a great deal. He had even encouraged me many times to \u201cgo for it\u201d in the preceding months. Still, it was an adjustment to watch me develop such deep feelings for someone else. And he was somewhat surprised to find himself struggling with his feelings over this. (Hadn\u2019t he slayed that green-eyed monster with the last relationship?) But this was another learning experience: Every relationship is different, and presents a new set of challenges. With time, and plenty of talking, I was able to give my husband the reassurance he needed. This wasn\u2019t a threat to our relationship. If anything, I loved him more than ever.\n\nAt the same time as I was trying to help my husband feel secure, I was also fearful about the future with my boyfriend. As the months went on, and I began to envision a lasting relationship with him, I worried constantly that he would leave me for a \u201cnormal\u201d life. He never expressed any jealousy over my relationship with my husband, but I knew it was frustrating for him that I wasn\u2019t freely available to leave my family and spend time together on a whim, and I felt guilty for the unavoidable limitations placed on us. But my boyfriend made it clear to me that he did see a future with me.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Our lives and loves sound complicated, and the world doesn't really understand -- but the truth is quite simple", "author": "Angi Becker Stevens", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Our lives and loves sound complicated, and the world doesn't really understand -- but the truth is quite simple", "title": "Polyamory works for us", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/04/12/polyamory_works_for_us/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/08/brain_heart_cheating-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Our lives and loves sound complicated, and the world doesn't really understand -- but the truth is quite simple", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/08/brain_heart_cheating-1280x960.jpg", "title": "Polyamory works for us", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Polyamory works for us", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Life stories, Love and Sex, Polyamory", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb5be\"", "article_summary": "So let me explain how it works \u2014 or, at least, how it works for us.\nTopics: Life stories, Love and Sex, Polyamory, Life NewsMy family is very ordinary to me.\nBecause polyamory don\u2019t rely on familiar social scripts, it\u2019s crucial to spell out terms and expectations rather than relying on assumptions.\nHe believed in polyamory, too, and we had long conversations about it together: how it could work, how it was truly possible.\nHe hadn\u2019t been familiar with polyamory before, though he said the idea made sense to him immediately."}
