Ahmad Kamal/Zuma Press\n\nPakistan this week brought into focus the impact that global market conditions are having on frontier economies. The country launched a $500 million bond issue with the hope that investor interest would be intense enough to warrant swelling the sale to $1 billion. No such luck, writes the Journal\u2019s Qasim Nauman. In a development that market participants politely described as a \u201cslight setback\u201d for Pakistan\u2019s reformist government, demand was weak enough to force the country to sell only the originally planned $500 million in bonds and to accept a relatively high yield of 8.25%.\n\nAnalysts questioned the government\u2019s decision to go ahead with the issue at a time when markets are nervous and many frontier investors are nursing losses. \u201cIf there is uncertainty in the global environment\u2026they could have waited for a few months,\u201d said one Karachi-based broker.\n\nGhana is pushing ahead with its own debt sale plan, Emese Bartha writes. On Wednesday the country began a series of investor meetings in Europe and the U.S. with a view to launching a $1 billion U.S. dollar-denominated bond\u2014and possibly a second issue of up to $500 million later in the year. Analysts have voiced concerns over the continued pressure Ghana\u2019s finances are facing but potential investors could be reassured by the fact that the International Development Association has agreed to guarantee up to $400 million to support Ghana\u2019s external debt financing.\n\nZambia, which has been struggling with power shortages that have crippled its vital mining sector, announced a plan to import natural gas from neighboring Angola to boost power generation, Nicholas Bariyo writes. The country\u2019s government is backing a $2.5 billion pipeline that, according to President Edgar Lungu, would carry both gas and refined petroleum products and could end overreliance on imports from the Middle East and stabilize electric power generation. Several mining companies have had to halt operations in the country this year because of unreliable electric power supplies.\n\nRatings agencies were this week divided on Zambia\u2019s prospects. Standard & Poor\u2019s kept its rating steady but Moody\u2019s took a harsher view. On Friday, it downgraded Zambia, saying it expects \u201ca sustained deterioration in fiscal and debt metrics\u2026amid an extended period of weak commodity prices, constrained copper production, and domestic electricity shortages constraining business activity.\u201d\n\nIf the meetings taking place in New York this week in the run-up to next week\u2019s UN General Assembly are any guide, business activity in Africa is actually booming. Africa-related events across the city attracted capacity crowds and the level of excitement about the continent\u2019s prospects appears undiminished, despite the difficult global economic environment.\n\nHage Geingob, the President of Namibia: \u201cWe must create a conducive investment climate.\u201d Dan Keeler/The Wall Street Journal\n\nAmid the enthusiasm, though, there are some grave concerns. WSJ Frontiers caught up with Hage Geingob, the President of Namibia and Tony Elumelu, one of Africa\u2019s richest businessmen, and found both men focused on remarkably similar issues. \u201cAfrica has to address the question of poverty,\u201d Geingob told WSJ Frontiers. \u201cAnd if we are to address poverty, we must create a conducive investment climate. The government must provide an environment for the private sector to create jobs.\u201d\n\nElumelu is focusing his attention on the growing problem of unemployment, particularly among the young, as well as the poverty that is fueling the growing surge of migrants leaving the continent. \u201cThis unemployment is a disaster,\u201d he explained. \u201cThe solution is in looking at the fundamentals. The jobs will come from the private sector. Political and private sector leaders must come together to create the right environment for the private sector to grow.\u201d\n\nBoth men are extremely optimistic about the continent\u2019s long-term prospects, economically and socially. Geingob believes we are seeing the creation of \u201ca new Africa, an Africa of electoral democracy, with no more coups. There will be some reversals but the new Africa will stay,\u201d he said.\n\nWith recent attempted coups in both Burundi and Burkina Faso, Geingob\u2019s optimism might seem a little premature. But that, Elumelu said, is the point. Last week\u2019s attempted coup in Burkina Faso was quickly overturned after six West African presidents flew to the capital of Ouagadougou to convince the renegade general to stand aside.\n\n\u201cYou see? That is the new Africa!\u201d Elumelu exclaimed.\n\nLondon-based Capital Economics is not so upbeat on the continent. Its analysts described the consensus around Africa as still \u201cfar too bullish\u201d, despite the decline in optimism triggered by China\u2019s troubles. The firm forecast \u201ctepid growth of just 3.8% in the region as a whole next year.\u201d It was particularly concerned about Nigeria, whose government it argued is \u201cengineering a slow-motion economic crisis by\u2026squeezing liquidity out of the economy.\u201d\n\nNigeria\u2019s central bank appears to be at least partially addressing that concern. Although it left its key interest rate unchanged at 13%, the bank loosened its reserve requirements for commercial banks to promote lending. Explaining their decision, the bank\u2019s policymakers cited declining output growth, rising unemployment and the evolving international economic environment \u201cas well as the need to properly position the economy on a sustainable growth path,\u201d the WSJ\u2019s Matthew Cowley reports.\n\nThe IMF has declared Cyprus\u2019 reform program a success and commended the fiscal management of the country, which two years ago needed a bailout as its economy buckled under its outsize banking system. \u201cEconomic activity in the first half of the year has been better than expected, and fiscal outturns are running ahead of projections. Liquidity in the core banking system has continued to improve, and the prospects for resolving non-performing loans are improving,\u201d the IMF commented.\n\nRatings agency Standard & Poor\u2019s is also impressed. This week it upgraded Cyprus to three notches below investment grade, Chelsey Dulaney reports.\n\nToo close? Daniel Scioli with current Argentine President Cristina Kirchner. Reuters\n\nArgentina\u2019s leading presidential candidate Daniel Scioli has been getting specific, Taos Turner writes. Scioli, who is known for speaking in generalities, is offering more details about the policies he would pursue if elected, in an apparent move to appeal to voters who fear he wouldn\u2019t differ from the current president Cristina Kirchner. Scioli\u2019s plans include increasing investment in science and technology to 1% of GDP from the current 0.6% and bringing inflation down to single digits. Reining in inflation could be tricky. Accurate figures are hard to come by but it is thought to be hovering around 25% currently.\n\nBolivian officials are calling on Chile to negotiate a deal to its border demand, writes Ryan Dube, rather than let an international court decide on an outcome. The International Court of Justice threw out a request from Chile, which argued that the tribunal didn\u2019t have jurisdiction over the case. Bolivia claims that it lost about 250 miles of coastline to Chile in a late-19th century war. Earlier in the week, a Bolivian legislative committee approved a bill to change the constitution, paving the way for President Evo Morales to stay in power beyond his current term.\n\nKey Stories from the WSJ\n\nFood Crisis Spreads Across Africa\n\nLibya\u2019s Rival Governments to Debate Final U.N.
