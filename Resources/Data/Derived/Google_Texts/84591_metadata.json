The app has never given the option to tip, so a part from the occasional good Samaritan, drivers had to be happy with their regular wage.\n\nBut thanks to a $100 million settlement with drivers in California and Massachusetts, tipping your Uber driver may become as normal as tipping your server.\n\nFriday's worker misclassification settlement gives drivers permission to actively seek tips and give poor ratings to riders who hold out.\n\nSo the next time you get an Uber, if you don't tip, the driver can give you a poor rating, which might affect your ability to catch a ride in the future.\n\nDrivers might be pleased with the extra income, and riders may be annoyed by the additional charge, but Uber could be the biggest winner of all in the settlement.\n\nHad the case gone to trial, the world's most valuable tech startup could have been ruled responsible for costs like social security and meeting minimum wage for its nearly half a million U.S. drivers.\n\nThanks to the settlement, Uber drivers are still freelance contractors who set their own hours but lack access to traditional employee benefits like health care.\n\nAs part of the settlement, Uber will also create and fund driver's associations in both states and meet quarterly to address driver concerns.\n\nUber said it has no plans to add a tipping option to its app, a feature that rival Lyft already offers, leaving riders and drivers to figure out one of the service industry's longest-running traditions on their own terms.\n\nThis video includes clips from Uber and Videoblocks.", "article_metadata": {"description": "After the $100 million settlement with drivers in two states, tipping your Uber driver might become as common as tipping your waiter.", "og": {"site_name": "Newsy", "description": "After the $100 million settlement with drivers in two states, tipping your Uber driver might become as common as tipping your waiter.", "title": "You Might Have To Start Tipping Your Uber Driver", "url": "http://www.newsy.com/videos/you-might-have-to-start-tipping-your-uber-driver/", "image": "http://newsymain.npgroup.netdna-cdn.com/images/videos/m/1461434287.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "After the $100 million settlement with drivers in two states, tipping your Uber driver might become as common as tipping your waiter.", "title": "You Might Have To Start Tipping Your Uber Driver", "url": "https://www.newsy.com/videos/you-might-have-to-start-tipping-your-uber-driver/", "image": "https://newsymain-npgroup.netdna-ssl.com/images/videos/m/1461434287.jpg", "site": "@newsyvideos", "player": {"width": 400, "identifier": "https://player.ooyala.com/tframe.html?embedCode=Zzdm0yMzE63CwsP-jS5YqA3T4COPuIWl&pbid=54ea1c2f14ee44369ddf31ac887ffe7e", "height": 225}, "app": {"url": {"ipad": "newsy://59244", "iphone": "newsy://59244", "googleplay": "com.newsy"}, "name": {"ipad": "Newsy: Video News", "iphone": "Newsy: Video News", "googleplay": "Newsy: Multisource Video News"}, "id": {"ipad": 330879884, "iphone": 330879884, "googleplay": "com.newsy"}}, "card": "player"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "newsy://59244", "app_store_id": 330879884, "app_name": "Newsy: Video News"}}, "msvalidate.01": "675C8D40A5F1E0722AA2D3A33379E884", "fb": {"app_id": 380870506022, "pages": 49978948774}, "google-site-verification": "o36fft0HATmhbZ_GPX4YSOS3EmkTGkPrvNFxQwzcNbY", "keywords": "uber tips, uber apps, uber settlement, uber lawsuit, uber contractors, uber employees, uber rating, uber cash tips, uber credit card tips, uber Massachusetts settlement, uber california settlement, uber freelance contractors, uber independent contractors, uber partners", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newsyvideos"}, "thumbnail": "http://newsymain.npgroup.netdna-cdn.com/images/videos/m/1461434287.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "After the $100 million settlement with drivers in two states, tipping your Uber driver might become as common as tipping your waiter.\nBut thanks to a $100 million settlement with drivers in California and Massachusetts, tipping your Uber driver may become as normal as tipping your server.\nThanks to the settlement, Uber drivers are still freelance contractors who set their own hours but lack access to traditional employee benefits like health care.\nAs part of the settlement, Uber will also create and fund driver's associations in both states and meet quarterly to address driver concerns.\nCalvin StovallIn the past, Uber riders haven't been pressured to tip their drivers."}
