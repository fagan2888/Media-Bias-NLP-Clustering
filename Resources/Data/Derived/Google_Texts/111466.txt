× “My mouth just dropped!” You’ll never believe what Goodwill workers found at a store in Virginia!

VIRGINIA (WITI) — You never know what you’ll find at Goodwill!

In fact, staffers at a store in Annandale, Virginia were stunned by how much one unexpected donation brought in.

Goodwill worker Sari Schray said she was sifting through donated jewelry last month when she came across a diamond ring in a bag filled with other jewelry.

She knew right away the band was 14-carat gold, but assumed the diamond wasn’t real. She assumed the store might be able to get $50 for it.

As it turned out…the gem was actually a three-carat diamond. It appraised for $8,300!

“It’s amazing. Words can’t describe it. My mouth just dropped. I was like really? Wow! I actually had it on my finger,” Schray said.

Then the ring sold for nearly $12,000. That money will be used to support job training programs at the store.

Goodwill workers will never know who donated the ring — or even whether they actually meant to give it away, unless that person comes forward.
