PERTH AMBOY – Embroiled in a backroom war with the county and district-wide leaders of her party, Mayor Wilda Diaz said she is “determined” to land her choice for law director in this historic wharf front city.

Diaz wants attorney Arlene Quinones Perez installed as the replacement for attorney Mark J. Blunda. Middlesex County Democratic Chairman Kevin McCabe and state Senator Joe Vitale (D-19) had other ideas, and trusted in a political relationship they had forged with Diaz, which now appears jeopardized.

“We disagree on this, that doesn’t mean we won’t find common ground on other things,” said Diaz, who highlighted in particular what she says is Vitale’s public service record in Trenton.

But Diaz won’t be buffaloed she said, and made another vow today.

“I’m definitely running again,” she said.

Having deposed former Mayor Joe Vas in 2008, bank teller turned giant slayer Diaz won reelection to a second term in 2012. She is up for reelection in 2016.

“We’re doing so many great things, I want to continue the progress,” added the mayor, who this morning welcomed U.S. Senator Bob Menendez to a health fair at the Jewish Renaissance Medical Center in Perth Amboy in celebration of National Health Center Week to announce a federal grant that the center received this week.

In the crowd stood attorney Billy Delgado, whom Diaz defeated to win her second term in 2012.

The occasion marked the grand opening of the Jewish Renaissance Medical Center, a community healthcare operation that received an infusion of federal funds under the auspices of the Affordable Care Act. Menendez personally helped get the funding for the center and his name graces the building.
