This bit of wisdom has become such a clich\u00e9 that it\u2019s almost insanity to repeat it\u2014but repeat it I will, because it perfectly summarizes Tuesday\u2019s State of the Union fiasco, as well as the Republican response.\n\nObama\u2019s speech covered the usual left-wing bases, highlighting many of the same ideas he\u2019s repeated over the past seven years: universal pre-K, \u201cfree\u201d community college, and using taxpayer dollars to rocket a grinning Joe Biden around the world so that he can pretend to cure cancer in a year. (That last idea, to be fair, was actually new. It is also, unfortunately, not a joke.)\n\nObamacare is running swimmingly, we were told, and mysteriously created millions of jobs when nobody was looking. The threat of climate change took up multiple presidential paragraphs, while ISIS was largely dismissed as a bunch of randomly generated yahoos tooling around in \u201cpickup trucks\u201d and \u201cplotting in apartments and garages.\u201d The president praised his Iran deal\u2014\u201cthe world has avoided another war\u201d\u2014while neglecting to mention the 10 American sailors detained by Iran that very day. The morning after, with the sailors safely \u201creleased,\u201d America was treated to gloating Iranian propaganda shots of their fellow citizens on their knees, hands behind their heads in surrender, surrounded by hostile guns.\n\nIt was, in short, a baloney buffet, in the heart of America\u2019s wildest baloney jungle. This is nothing new, of course; when the State of the Union rolls around each year, it leaves a host of nonsense explosions in its wake. This year, South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley was given the thankless task of providing the Republican response to the president\u2019s speech. She certainly had a towering pile of absurdities to pick from. Instead, she focused the bulk of her ire upon one Donald J. Trump.\n\nLook, I like Nikki Haley. I\u2019m also sorry that we have to deal with the knuckleheaded golden-haired Cape buffalo that is Donald Trump. But to go off on Trump after you\u2019ve been offered a huge, steaming platter of presidential baloney seems to miss the mark.\n\nFirst of all, Donald Trump is not a purely Republican phenomenon. Trump\u2019s \u201cvery best voters,\u201d as Nate Cohn recently pointed out in the New York Times, \u201care self-identified Republicans who nonetheless are registered as Democrats.\u201d Trump\u2019s strongest supporters are not ideological Republicans; they\u2019re also highly unlikely to turn out to vote. In this light, Nikki Haley scolding Trump supporters for succumbing to \u201cloud\u201d and \u201cangry\u201d voices isn\u2019t just wildly ineffective, it\u2019s also subtly condescending to the rest of the Republican base.\n\n\u201cI called out Republicans and I called out Democrats, because I think it\u2019s important,\u201d Haley told \u201cCBS This Morning.\u201d \u201cIf the country\u2019s going to move forward, we all need to look in the mirror.\u201d\n\nFair enough. But the GOP might be advised to also look out the window once in a while. \u201cWe have a good field,\u201d Marco Rubio reminded the press on Wednesday. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any socialists running. None of our candidates are under FBI investigation.\u201d This, please remember, is the reality of the current Democratic presidential frontrunner. Touch\u00e9, Marco.\n\nThere\u2019s something larger going on here, however. After Obama\u2019s speech and Haley\u2019s rebuttal, a chorus of voices echoed a song that now seems as old as time: Obama and Trump are diametrically opposed. Trump is from Mars; Obama is from Venus. Trump is a juvenile joke; Obama is the professorial adult. When it comes to Trump and Obama, wrote Chris Cillizza of The Washington Post, you could not ask for \u201ca better encapsulation of the competing visions being offered the country in 2016.\u201d\n\nReally? As far as I can see, they\u2019re both wild about abusing executive power. Obama is just more tasteful about it. On Sunday, Trump, who often speaks of magic, one-man solutions, told \u201cMeet the Press\u201d he would use executive orders \u201cto do a lot of things.\u201d The same week, Trump publicly marveled at North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un\u2019s amazing skills at purging his various political enemies from planet Earth. Obama, meanwhile, has long championed a \u201cgo it alone\u201d executive strategy. On Tuesday, he quietly announced\u2014at a breakfast, through White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough\u2014plans for \u201caudacious executive action over the course of the year.\u201d\n\nTrump is crazy, critics shriek, and this may very well be true. However, as a reminder, Obama just announced that the Iran deal is working, that we should give everyone two years of free community college, and that Joe Biden, who is not an oncologist but rather the king of inappropriate hugs at political events, is going to help cure cancer. Is this really less preposterous than Trump announcing that the Mexicans are going to pay for a giant, fantastic wall they don\u2019t want built?\n\nHere\u2019s the truth: America is still great. It\u2019s D.C that\u2019s the farce. The Obama/Trump vision, if you give it a closer look, is wholly Washington-centric, focused on a single and growing center of power. If Republicans really wanted to differentiate themselves, they might champion the opposite: an optimistic, freedom-centric, limited-government approach. Seriously, it\u2019s not that hard. You don\u2019t even have to be \u201cloud\u201d and \u201cangry\u201d to do so. You just have to cut through the baloney.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Insanity, as the well-worn aphorism goes, consists of doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.
