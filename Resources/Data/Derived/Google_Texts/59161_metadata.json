VINNY TENNIS \u2014 DIGITAL FIRST MEDIA\n\nFor the first time in more than a decade, there is no incumbent running in Pennsylvania\u2019s 6th Congressional District.\n\nRepublican Jim Gerlach, whose re-election efforts were regularly ranked as among the most hard-fought in the nation, announced in January that he would not seek a seventh term.\n\nThe Democrat looking to fill the open seat is familiar to 6th District voters. Manan Trivedi, 40, an Iraq war U.S. Marine veteran and doctor from Union Township in Berks County is making his third run for the office. He has not previously held elected office and lost twice to Gerlach.\n\nBy contrast, his Republican opponent, West Chester resident Ryan Costello, 38, is chairman of the Chester County Board of Commissioners and has served previous as an East Vincent Township Supervisor and as Chester County Recorder of Deeds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoth candidates agreed to speak with The Mercury separately, but about the same subjects.\n\nTrivedi agreed to speak on camera and video from his interview is posted on pottsmerc.com; Costello opted for a telephone interview.\n\nThere was at least one area of agreement \u2014 both candidates said they do not oppose same sex marriage, Trivedi as a matter of principle, Costello as a matter of settled law.\n\nMiddle Class erosion\n\nThe candidates approach to the stagnating economic conditions increasingly faced by the district\u2019s mostly middle class voters reflected their party\u2019s positions.\n\nCostello echoed Gerlach\u2019s prior calls for a \u201ccomplete re-do of the tax code,\u201d saying making it more simplified and predictable would decrease the cost of complying freeing up more money for businesses to make capital investments and expand, thus creating more jobs.\n\nHe also pointed to more domestic energy production, noting that the shale natural gas boom in Pennsylvania has created many higher-paying jobs. \u201cYou don\u2019t need a college education to get a job with good pay in that industry. There is a tremendous future in that industry,\u201d Costello said.\n\nOverregulation by the federal government is also squelching investment and business expansion, Costello said, noting that many regulations are undertaken \u201cwithout anyone doing a cost-benefit analysis.\u201d\n\nAs one example, Costello again borrowed from Gerlach\u2019s list of issues, singling out the tax on medical devices as a job killer.\n\nAnother example is the Dodd-Frank regulations which, while still needed for large Wall Street banks to prevent another economic collapse, also make it more difficult for community banks to make the kind of loans necessary for smell businesses to be established.\n\n\u201cA community bank\u2019s ability to lend is the heart and soul of Main Street,\u201d Costello said.\n\nTrivedi said the increasing difficulty of maintaining a middle class lifestyle \u201cis the biggest issue Congress needs to address.\u201d With more money coming under the control of the super-rich, \u201cthe middle class is disappearing,\u201d he said.\n\nThe first thing Congress should do is raise the federal minimum wage for $10.10 an hour, Trivedi said.\n\n\u201cEvery time we have raised the minimum wage in this country, it has jump-started the economy,\u201d Trivedi said. \u201cIf you give millionaires and billionaires a few extra bucks, they put just put it in their pocket. if you give a few extra bucks to people making minimum wage they put it right back into the economy.\u201d\n\nTrivedi said another way to support the middle class would be to slow the rapid growth in college costs.\n\n\u201cBig time banks on Wall Street can get very low interest rates, but kids who want to go to college, are paying rates five times or 10 times as much,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI believe in evidence-based policies and although Washington seems to be an \u2018evidence-free zone,\u2019 these days, I can say one of the best investments you can make, even f you don\u2019t care about kids, is in pre-K education,\u201d Trivedi said. \u201cBy the time those kids graduate, they will make 10-times or 20-times what those who don\u2019t get that help will make.\u201d\n\nAdded Trivedi, \u201cif you want to know that your economy is going to be in better shape 20 to 25 years from now, the single most important thing you can do is invest in education.\u201d\n\nCostello said the federal government does not control what private colleges charge, but he said the federal government can help ensure that \u201cfair interest rates\u201d are charged and that the terms of the loans are \u201ctransparent\u201d to the students taking them out.\n\nHe also said more emphasis should be placed on \u201ccareer awareness in junior and senior high school\u201d so those students who do undertake large debts have a clear understanding of the return from their educational investment.\n\nObamacare\n\nTrivedi said several positives came out of the Affordable Care Act, including coverage for adult children, the elimination of pre-existing conditions as a reason for being denied insurance and expanded coverage.\n\n\u201cThe main problem is the \u2018affordable care act\u2019 is not really that affordable yet,\u201d Trivedi said.\n\nHis experience in the medical field can help Congress find ways to save money on the medical end of the equation, Trivedi said.\n\n\u201cLook, 30 percent of what we do in health care makes no difference in outcomes,\u201d he said.\n\nSome providers, such as Geisinger Health Systems in the central part of the state, have focused on ways money can be saved and outcomes improved at the same time, such as ways to decrease in-hospital infections and incentivize doctors to make sure patients don\u2019t return to the hospital with the same problem.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the Holy Grail of figuring out this health care crisis,\u201d Trivedi said. \u201cAnd who better to fix Obamacare than someone who\u2019s a doctor?\u201d\n\nCostello said Obamacare has become a burden on small businesses and is one of the obstacles to higher wages and more Americans obtaining the middle class lifestyle.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s 20,000 pages of complex rule-making and the premiums are too high for small businesses in the 6th District, which has resulted in businesses cutting hours below 30 a week and an increase in part-time employment,\u201d he said.\n\nClimate change\n\nBoth candidates agree that climate change is occurring.\n\nCostello said the federal government\u2019s response should be \u201cpromote energy efficient buildings and more domestic energy production to help lower our carbon footprint.\u201d\n\nThe federal government should also alternative energy initiatives, he said.\n\nCostello said he would have voted for a recent flood insurance bill, which, among other things has taxpayers providing coverage in flood-prone areas, like barrier islands, made more vulnerable by climate change and which private insurance companies have eschewed.\n\nHowever he said he believes limits should be put in place on initiatives such as that.\n\nTrivedi called climate change \u201cthe crisis of our time,\u201d adding \u201call the other things we\u2019re talking about might not matter if we\u2019re underwater or broiling under higher temperatures.\u201d\n\nHe agreed with Costello that the nation\u2019s carbon footprint needs to be lowered and said the obvious answer is increased investment in alternative energy sources that don\u2019t emit as much carbon into the air.\n\n\u201cWe need to look at wind, solar, geo-thermal, hydro-electric. I mean China, Brazil and Germany are kicking our butts in development of solar energy resources,\u201d Trivedi said.\n\nPrivacy Vs. Security\n\nBoth candidates also said they recognize the complexity inherent in trying to balance an increasingly hostile and diverse set of security threats against violating Americans\u2019 right to privacy and the ease with which electronic spying makes that possible.\n\n\u201cAs a guy who served in iraq, I certainly recognize there are a lot of evil folks out there who want to come and get us, and we need to go after them by any means necessary,\u201d Trivedi said. \u201cBut it can\u2019t be an affront to everything we in America stand for.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt seems to be a little too invasive,\u201d said Trivedi. \u201cObviously, I\u2019m not privy to any of the secret meeting, but there are smart people down there who know when enough is enough and I think we might have to see some reigning in of the (National Security Agency).\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying the federal government is over-stepping,\u201d said Costello, \u201cbut I do think Congress needs to look more closely. As a private citizen, I am frequently asking myself what kind of sacrifice should we be making to be sure security is maintained?\u201d\n\nCostello added, \u201ctechnology has promoted great progress in many ways, in the economy and quality of life, but it also raises some very complex policy questions.\u201d\n\nResidency\n\nIt is usually taken as a given that a candidate for office lives in the district he seeks to represent, but that is not the case in this race \u2014 any more at least.\n\n\u201cI think a representative from the 6th District, should live in the 6th District,\u201d Costello said.\n\nWhen Trivedi first ran for the 6th District seat, he lived within its borders.\n\nBut when redistricting came about in 2012, the lines were moved and Union Township is now in the 7th Congressional District.\n\n\u201cI think they were trying to figure out which side of the bed I sleep on when they were drawing the lines,\u201d he joked.\n\nHis residence is now \u201ca couple miles\u201d from the district\u2019s nearest point. And if he\u2019s elected, Trivedi said he would not move to be within its borders, adding the law does not require it.\n\n\u201cListen, I grew up in Fleetwood. My mom still lives there, to question my connection to the district is sort of ridiculous,\u201d Trivedi said.\n\nHe said both sides play with the district lines when redistricting is done.\n\n\u201cIt should be much more based on municipal lines, county boundaries and natural lines,\u201d Trivedi said.\n\n\u201cFrankly, this is why people are so frustrated with Harrisburg and D.C. They keep playing these political games and they\u2019re not getting anything real done.\u201d\n\nIn case you are still wondering if you live in the 6th District, see the related article on where the lines are drawn in the TriCounty area.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "News, Pottstown news, PA news, US news, world news.", "title": "Costello, Trivedi vie for Pa.\u2019s 6th Congressional District seat", "og": {"url": "http://www.pottsmerc.com/article/MP/20141026/NEWS/141029762", "image": {"width": "1500px", "identifier": "http://www.pottsmerc.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/MP/20141026/NEWS/141029762/AR/0/AR-141029762.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "923px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Costello, Trivedi vie for Pa.\u2019s 6th Congressional District seat"}, "twitter": {"domain": "pottsmerc.com", "description": "For the first time in more than a decade, there is no incumbent running in Pennsylvania\u2019s 6th Congressional District.", "title": "Costello, Trivedi vie for Pa.\u2019s 6th Congressional District seat", "url": "http://www.pottsmerc.com/article/MP/20141026/NEWS/141029762", "image": {"src": "http://www.pottsmerc.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/MP/20141026/NEWS/141029762/AR/0/AR-141029762.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@MercuryX", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id563333553", "iphone": "id525118208", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.mercury"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "News, Pottstown news, PA news, US news, world news.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "For the first time in more than a decade, there is no incumbent running in Pennsylvania\u2019s 6th Congressional District."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc22d\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI think a representative from the 6th District, should live in the 6th District,\u201d Costello said.\nMiddle Class erosionThe candidates approach to the stagnating economic conditions increasingly faced by the district\u2019s mostly middle class voters reflected their party\u2019s positions.\nThe Democrat looking to fill the open seat is familiar to 6th District voters.\nWhen Trivedi first ran for the 6th District seat, he lived within its borders.\n\u201cIt should be much more based on municipal lines, county boundaries and natural lines,\u201d Trivedi said."}
