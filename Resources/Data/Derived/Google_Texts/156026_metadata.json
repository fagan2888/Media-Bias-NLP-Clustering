His game has waned in recent years, but he is still widely regarded as one of the best cornerbacks in history and seems a Hall-of-Fame lock.\n\nBailey\u2019s younger brother, Rodney \u201cBoss\u201d Bailey, was drafted by the Lions in the second round of the 2003 draft and played four full seasons as a linebacker in Detroit before signing with the Broncos in 2008. Boss\u2019 career ended when he was released in 2009.\n\nNFL Network\u2019s Ian Rapoport confirmed the news of Bailey\u2019s workout in Detroit, adding that it went well but that no deal is imminent.\n\nThe #Lions sounded like they liked Champ Bailey\u2019s workout, that it went well. Source tells me no signing imminent, though. \u2014 Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) September 4, 2014", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Broncos,Champ Bailey,Detroit Lions,New Orleans Saints,NFL", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "First-and-Orange", "description": "Former Bronco and 12-time Pro Bowler, Champ Bailey, was said to have worked out with Detroit on Thursday after being released by the Saints.", "title": "Champ Bailey works out for Detroit Lions, report says", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2014/09/04/report-champ-bailey-works-lions/29236/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2014/09/champ-bailey-new-orleans-saints.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Former Bronco and 12-time Pro Bowler, Champ Bailey, was said to have worked out with Detroit on Thursday after being released by the Saints.", "title": "Report: Champ Bailey works out for Detroit Lions", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2014/09/04/report-champ-bailey-works-lions/29236/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2014/09/champ-bailey-new-orleans-saints.jpg", "creator": "@nickijhabvala", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "language": "en, sv", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Former Bronco and 12-time Pro Bowler, Champ Bailey, was said to have worked out with Detroit on Thursday after being released by the Saints."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd73c3\"", "article_summary": "Champ Bailey, the former Bronco and 12-time Pro Bowler who was released by the Saints last weekend, worked out with the Detroit Lions on Thursday, The National Football Post reported.\nNFL Network\u2019s Ian Rapoport confirmed the news of Bailey\u2019s workout in Detroit, adding that it went well but that no deal is imminent.\n\u2014 Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) September 4, 2014\nThe #Lions sounded like they liked Champ Bailey\u2019s workout, that it went well.\nBailey\u2019s younger brother, Rodney \u201cBoss\u201d Bailey, was drafted by the Lions in the second round of the 2003 draft and played four full seasons as a linebacker in Detroit before signing with the Broncos in 2008."}
