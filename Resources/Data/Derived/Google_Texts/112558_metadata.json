Here are the winning Powerball numbers drawn at 11 p.m. on Saturday, Sept. 7: 2-19-22-26-45, and the Powerball selected was 24.\n\nOver the past month, the jackpot has risen steadily, making Saturday's top prize worth $203 million, or $115.5 million if the cash option is chosen.\n\nDuring the last drawing, Wednesday night, no tickets matched all the winning numbers (2-9-26-45,47; Powerball 11). Tickets sold in nine states matched five numbers, but not the Powerball and are worth $1 million before taxes.\n\nMeanwhile, a Mega Millions ticket sold in the Garden State just missed hitting Tuesday's $95 million jackpot. The ticket bought at J.Y.C.D. Deli & Grocery on Commerical Avenue in New Brunswick contained five numbers and is worth $250,000, lottery officials said.\n\nThe winning numbers drawn were: 4, 13,14, 28 and 41. The Gold Mega Ball was 28 and the Megaplier Multiplier was 3.\n\nThough there wasn't a $1 million ticket sold in New Jersey for the most recent Powerball drawing, someone who bought a ticket in Bloomfield won that amount in the Aug. 31 drawing.\n\nStar-Ledger staff writer Jeff Goldman contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "'@lottery','@river','powerball'", "title": "Winning Powerball numbers for Sept. 7 drawing; jackpot estimated at $203 million", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Winning Powerball numbers for Sept. 7 drawing; jackpot estimated at $203 million \", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2013/09/winning_powerball_numbers_for_sept_7_drawing_jackpot_estimated_at_203_million.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/ledgerupdates_impact/photo/2013/09/13370715-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11200966\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-09-08T03:07:05Z\", \"author\": \"Len Melisurgo | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com\", \"tags\": [\"@lottery\",\"@river\",\"powerball\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.nj.com/ledgerupdates_impact/photo/2013/09/13370715-thumb_square_large.jpg", "creator": "@LensReality", "description": "Time to check your tickets to see if the losing streak is over.
