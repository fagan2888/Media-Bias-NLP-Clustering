So I\u2019m wondering, how does that impact my family?\u201d\n\nThe Huffakers would have to pay additional fees on top of tuition for the college health plan. They think they might get a better deal through Covered California, but they\u2019d have to put Shelby on one plan and the four still in San Diego on another because the regions don\u2019t have the same providers.\n\nHuffaker doesn\u2019t know if she can purchase a patchwork of plans, or if it would make financial sense.\n\nThe Takeaway: The Huffakers can\u2019t mix and match plans.\n\nThe Huffakers can\u2019t bundle two different plans to build their family insurance policy, said Covered California spokeswoman Ann Gonzales. Plans in different regions come with different price tags, and each insurance provider has to be paid separately. Logistically, it just wouldn\u2019t work.\n\nGonzales said Covered California is reviewing its policy on the issue, noting that it impacts more than just college students. Parents who live in different areas and have joint custody of their children, for instance, could be impacted.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean Shelby can\u2019t participate in the exchange, though. She could take out an individual plan with Covered California. Gonzales said she could potentially qualify for federal subsidies based on the family\u2019s income that puts the premium below the cost of the college plan.\n\nEither way, Shelby\u2019s situation will not impact subsidies for her parents\u2019 and siblings\u2019 plans. The discount is calculated by household income and the number of dependents her parents have. As long as the Huffakers claim Shelby on their taxes, she\u2019ll factor into their premium costs, Gonzales said.\n\nThe Orders: Shop around.\n\nThe Huffakers should pull out a calculator and compare the cost of the school\u2019s insurance with the plans on Covered California. Plans for a young adult in Santa Barbara start at $122 a month.\n\nCheck out last week\u2019s Second Opinion: How Do Undocumented Parents Cover Their Citizen Kids?\n\nVoice of San Diego is a nonprofit that depends on you, our readers.
