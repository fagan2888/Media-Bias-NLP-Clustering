WESTMORELAND, N.H. (AP) â€” State police say two brothers who are wanted in New Jersey led police in Vermont and New Hampshire on a chase before being caught.

The pursuit began Friday afternoon when Vermont State Police pulled over a car connected to an ongoing investigation. Inside were Christopher and Christian Torruellas, both 22, of Jersey City.

The brothers fled into New Hampshire where state police picked up the chase and stopped the Grand Am by puncturing its tires. The brothers ran off but Christopher Torruellas was quickly caught and Christian was found about 45 minutes later in a barn.

Christopher Torruellas is wanted on a robbery charge while Christian Torruellas faces a federal charge of unlawful possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.

Both are being held in the county jail.
