By the middle of 2008, they wrote, she was associating with foreign terrorists who valued her ability to recruit jihadists online.\n\nLaRose cooperated extensively with authorities following her arrest, prosecutors said, and her diligence and candor aided several national security investigations. But they said she has shown a \u201ccomplete lack of remorse\u201d in her prison correspondence and \u201ccontinues to present a danger to the American people.\u201d\n\nShe has continued signing her name as \u201cJihad Jane,\u201d repeatedly called Americans \u201cfilthy kafir pigs,\u201d and told one admirer she has \u201cno regrets\u201d about the plot, the memo noted.\n\nShe \u201cseemed to take pleasure and even pride recounting her glory days as \u2018the hunter,\u2019 prosecutors wrote.\n\nLaRose\u2019s public defender did not return a message Thursday.\n\nAnother defendant, Mohammad Khalid, met LaRose in a chat room when he was 15 and began corresponding with her, prosecutors say. They allege the onetime high school honors student agreed to raise money and recruit terrorists for jihad, and helped LaRose by receiving a package from her, removing a passport from it and forwarding other items to co-conspirators.\n\nThe Pakistan-born teen portrayed himself online as \u201ca tireless soldier for violent jihad,\u201d prosecutors wrote, but, like LaRose, cooperated extensively with the government after his 2011 arrest. He pleaded guilty to a single count of conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists and could get up to 15 years in prison.\n\nProsecutors have asked for a reduced sentence of less than 10 years based on his cooperation, but expressed concern he might be \u201cre-radicalized.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile cooperating so diligently with the government, Khalid seemed still to take pleasure and even pride recounting his glory days as a jihadi,\u201d they wrote in a sentencing memo this week.\n\nKhalid\u2019s attorney, Jeffrey Lindy, blasted the government\u2019s handling of Khalid\u2019s case, calling him a wayward adolescent.\n\n\u201cThe government is once again wildly wrong in how they evaluated Mohammad Khalid,\u201d said Lindy, who has asked the judge to postpone his client\u2019s sentencing so he can be evaluated by a mental health expert. \u201cIt\u2019s nonsense. It\u2019s been nonsense from the beginning, but they don\u2019t want to accept it, so they\u2019re going to have a nice fight on their hands at sentencing.\u201d\n\nThe government on Thursday requested a sentence of 10 years for Paulin-Ramirez, the third defendant, who dubbed herself \u201cJihad Jamie.\u201d Officials say Paulin-Ramirez helped the cause by marrying an Algerian terror suspect.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Feds seek long sentence in Pa. \u2018Jihad Jane\u2019 case", "title": "Feds seek long sentence in Pa. \u2018Jihad Jane\u2019 case", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/01/02/feds-seek-long-sentence-in-pa-jihad-jane-case/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140102__jihad_Jamie_Paulin-Ramirezp1.jpg", "height": 450}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140102__jihad_Jamie_Paulin-Ramirezp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-02T13:13:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T02:15:50+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbed6\"", "article_summary": "She \u201cseemed to take pleasure and even pride recounting her glory days as \u2018the hunter,\u2019 prosecutors wrote.\nThe Pakistan-born teen portrayed himself online as \u201ca tireless soldier for violent jihad,\u201d prosecutors wrote, but, like LaRose, cooperated extensively with the government after his 2011 arrest.\nProsecutors called LaRose a \u201clonely and isolated\u201d woman with few friends and an absent boyfriend when she turned to the Internet for distraction.\nBy the middle of 2008, they wrote, she was associating with foreign terrorists who valued her ability to recruit jihadists online.\nLaRose cooperated extensively with authorities following her arrest, prosecutors said, and her diligence and candor aided several national security investigations."}
