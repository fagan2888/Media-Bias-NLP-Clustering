â€” Raleigh police arrested a Wake Forest man Thursday night in connection with a case where a teenager took a picture of a man who allegedly solicited sex from him.

Gennaro Salvatore Anastasio, 69, of 1117 Front Gate Lane, was charged with one count of indecent liberties with a minor.

The 13-year-old boy, who just got off a school bus, was walking home on the 900 block of Wake Towne Drive on Feb. 21 when a man drove up to him and asked for sex.

The boy refused the request, investigators said, and the man drove away in a tan or silver sedan.

But not before the teen used his cellphone to take a picture of him.

Thursday's arrest came two days after investigators released the picture to the public.

Anastasio was released on a $50,000 bond and he has a court appearance Friday morning.
