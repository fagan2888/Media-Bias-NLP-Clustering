DES MOINES, Iowa -- Starting January 1, 2015 large employers will be required to provide health insurance to their full-time employees, or pay a penalty. This Wednesday and Thursday the Iowa Insurance Division is hosting a free training conference for employers and stakeholders on the changes coming up in the 2015 ACA.

Iowa has had conference on the ACA in the past, but organizers say this is the first time Iowans will have the opportunity to speak with federal officials from the IRS, the U.S. Department of Labor, and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Organizers say this is a great opportunity to clarify any question you may have on ACA because these are the officials that will regulate it.

Federal officials will present information and answer questions about the employer’s responsibility of payment, new employer reporting requirements, and the small business tax credit.

Wednesday’s conference will focus on what employers will need to do for the 2015 ACA. Thursday’s conference is for stakeholders. The conference runs from 8 a.m. – 4:30 p.m. both days at Olmsted Center at Drake University.
