McGregor also has an uncanny ability to predict not only the outcome of a fight, but the manner in which he\u2019ll accomplish his next feat of pugilistic prowess.\n\nMcGregor called his shot well before his featherweight title bout with Jose Aldo at UFC 194, vowing he wouldn\u2019t need a full round to stop a champion who hadn\u2019t lost in 10 years. And then he delivered that shot to the side of Aldo\u2019s head to end the fight in just 13 seconds \u2014 a little quicker than even he expected.\n\n\u201cMystic Mac strikes again,\u201d McGregor said.\n\nFor as much as McGregor talks, he was sure to get some predictions right. Yet when asked to foresee his own future after he ended Aldo\u2019s 18-fight winning streak, McGregor wasn\u2019t quite ready.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll give it some time,\u201d McGregor said Saturday night. \u201cIt\u2019s Christmas. In the fight game, you travel around, making weight or doing something, and Christmas was taken from me many times. This Christmas was not taken from me, so I get to go home. I\u2019ve put in a hell of a lot of work. It\u2019s been a crazy, crazy year.\u201d\n\nIndeed, McGregor reigns atop the featherweight division and the sport after a remarkable 2015. He won three fights, made untold millions and raised his fame near the heights reached by Ronda Rousey, who will be featured alongside him on the cover of EA Sports\u2019 new UFC video game.\n\n\u201cI think I am the pound-for-pound No. 1,\u201d McGregor said. \u201cI believe there are many great fighters. There are people who do great things, but when you combine it all together, when you combine the whole package, the whole animal that is the fight game, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s nobody that does it better than me.\u201d\n\nAnd McGregor predicts next year will be even bigger.\n\nMcGregor\u2019s next fight will be a title bout at either featherweight or lightweight. McGregor\u2019s coach, John Kavanagh, has said the weight cut to the 145-pound featherweight limit is becoming too tough on the burly fighter.", "article_metadata": {"description": "After beating Aldo, McGregor wants to hold a second UFC belt", "title": "After beating Aldo, McGregor wants to hold a second UFC belt", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "After beating Aldo, McGregor wants to hold a second UFC belt", "title": "After beating Aldo, McGregor wants to hold a second UFC belt", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/12/13/after_beating_aldo_mcgregor_wants_to_hold_a_second_ufc_belt/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/12/aptopix-ufc-194-mixed-martial-arts.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "After beating Aldo, McGregor wants to hold a second UFC belt", "title": "After beating Aldo, McGregor wants to hold a second UFC belt", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/12/aptopix-ufc-194-mixed-martial-arts.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Greg Beacham", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "McGregor called his shot well before his featherweight title bout with Jose Aldo at UFC 194, vowing he wouldn\u2019t need a full round to stop a champion who hadn\u2019t lost in 10 years.\nThe Irish star possesses a punching power that has made him an undisputed world champion in just seven UFC fights.\nIt\u2019s been a crazy, crazy year.\u201dIndeed, McGregor reigns atop the featherweight division and the sport after a remarkable 2015.\nIn the fight game, you travel around, making weight or doing something, and Christmas was taken from me many times.\nYet when asked to foresee his own future after he ended Aldo\u2019s 18-fight winning streak, McGregor wasn\u2019t quite ready."}
