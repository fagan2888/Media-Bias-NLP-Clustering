Come to think of it, if you could please give them all a certificate that allows them to go back to high school and repeat both algebra and logical reasoning classes, I would deeply appreciate it and it would probably help us all.\n\nFor my fellow gun-rights supporters, please bring reminders that we need to be better than our opponents. Be polite when they are rude. Be kind always in debate and action. Be of good humor when they are nothing but angry and irrational. Be consistently responsible with your firearm even though they think that\u2019s an impossibility.\n\nFinally, Santa, my kid wants to compete in 3-Gun when he\u2019s older. Please bring me a good guide on choosing the right rifle for him. We\u2019ve got the shotgun and handgun covered, but the rifle is new ground for us.\n\nMerry Christmas to all.\n\nYour big fan in St. Louis,\n\nVik Khanna\n\nVik Khanna is a health care consultant, writer, and gun owner in St. Louis, MO.
