The Pro-Rubio Super PAC began the year hitting Chris Christie for being a \u201chigh-tax, Common Core, liberal-energy loving, Obamacare Medicaid-expanding president\u201d like President Obama. Rubio has declared those attacks accurate and has been highlighting Christie\u2019s record on the stump.\n\nIn response, Christie has criticized Rubio\u2019s inexperience and his record on immigration reform, pointing out that the freshman senator fled his \u201cGang of Eight\u201d attempt to give illegal immigrants amnesty.\n\nChristie pointed out during an interview with Laura Ingraham this morning that Rubio did the opposite of what he promised to give to voters in Florida when he was elected.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not something that\u2019s going to be greatly appealing or uniting for our party,\u201d Christie said.\n\nBut that won\u2019t stop the Rubio from repeating that he is the best candidate to run against Hillary Clinton.\n\n\u201dI think people realize on the Republican side that we cannot afford, this country cannot afford, to lose this election and that I give the party the best chance not just to unify the conservative movement but to grow it, to take our message to people that don\u2019t vote Republican now, grow our party, grow our movement and defeat Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders,\u201d Rubio said in an interview with Good Morning America this morning.\n\nThat\u2019s the line the Rubio campaign is selling in New Hampshire, as they are focused on message discipline.\n\n\u201cMarco is the only candidate who can unite conservatives and beat Hillary Clinton,\u201d Pounder said in his statement to Breitbart News.\n\nIn the last debate in Iowa, Rubio ignored the opportunity to attack Christie on the stage in favor of a positive message. In Saturday\u2019s debate in New Hampshire, however, expect Christie to take Rubio head-on.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s get the boy in the bubble out of the bubble, and lets see him play for the next week in New Hampshire,\u201d Christie said in New Hampshire this morning. \u201cI\u2019m ready to play, I hope he is, because I\u2019ll be ready to see him on Saturday night.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Marco Rubio\u2019s Anti-Christie Strategy: Highlight Liberal Blue State Record", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Marco Rubio\u2019s Anti-Christie Strategy: Highlight Liberal Blue State Record", "title": "Marco Rubio\u2019s Anti-Christie Strategy: Highlight Liberal Blue State Record - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/01/Marco-Rubio-Pursed-Mouth-AP.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/02/02/marco-rubios-anti-christie-strategy-highlight-liberal-blue-state-record/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Marco Rubio\u2019s Anti-Christie Strategy: Highlight Liberal Blue State Record", "creator": "@charliespiering", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/01/Marco-Rubio-Pursed-Mouth-AP.jpg", "title": "Marco Rubio\u2019s Anti-Christie Strategy: Highlight Liberal Blue State Record - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "blue state, Chris Christie, Iowa, liberal, Marco Rubio, Record,2016 Presidential Race, Big Government,Marco Rubio", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "Record", "published_time": "2016-02-02T11:05:33-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd25bc\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIt\u2019s not something that\u2019s going to be greatly appealing or uniting for our party,\u201d Christie said.\n\u201cLet\u2019s get the boy in the bubble out of the bubble, and lets see him play for the next week in New Hampshire,\u201d Christie said in New Hampshire this morning.\n\u201cMarco is the only candidate who can unite conservatives and beat Hillary Clinton,\u201d Pounder said in his statement to Breitbart News.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERIn response, Rubio spokesman Joe Pounder dismissed Christie\u2019s attack as a bunch of \u201chot air\u201d and attacked his political record in New Jersey.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERAs Marco Rubio returns to New Hampshire, he faces New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, a rival who has been laying groundwork in the state since August."}
