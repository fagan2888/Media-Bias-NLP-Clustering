He also pointed out there isn\u2019t a broader impact on its U.S. federal government business.\n\n\u201cGiven the speculated US$90-million contract value to Accenture, the dollar opportunity lost for CGI is negligible \u2014 US$90-million on a revenue base of $10-billion,\u201d he said.\n\nThe analyst also suggested it is possible CGI will receive another contract from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) related to the Accenture transition.\n\nMr. Penner noted the original healthcare.gov contract announced by CGI on Dec. 1, 2011, was a two-year deal estimated to be worth US$93.7-million. There were three potential one-year option periods.\n\nAt a congressional hearing in October, the company testified the contract\u2019s total value was US$290-million, of which US$112-million had been paid.\n\nRather than focusing on CGI\u2019s health business, which accounts for 8% of the company\u2019s revenue, Mr. Penner\u2019s bullish case is based on CGI\u2019s exposure to the European recovery and the U.S. expansion.\n\nHe rates the stock a buy with a $46 price target.\n\nJustin Kew, an analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald, noted that CGI continues to be an active supplier to CMS and has been awarded US$37-million in additional contracts since early October 2013.\n\nCGI is also the lead contractor for state-run exchanges in Colorado, Hawaii, Massachusetts and Vermont.\n\nSo while admitting that the CMS contract is high profile, Mr. Kew said the loss will have little impact on CGI\u2019s long-term revenue and order backlog.\n\n\u201cWhile this news has pressured CGI\u2019s stock, we believe that the company\u2019s fundamentals remain solid and, in time, will be reflected in its share price,\u201d he said.\n\nThe analyst noted the healthcare.gov contract represents approximately 1% of CGI\u2019s 2013 revenue ($10.1-billion) and the total value of the two one-year extensions represents less than 0.5% of its current $18.7-billion backlog.\n\nMr. Kew also rates CGI a buy with a $46 price target.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"The inflammatory media portrayal that CGI was 'jettisoned' from the business or was 'fired' by Obama distorts the fact that funding had all but run out for the contract,\" says TD Securities", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "Financial Post", "description": "\"The inflammatory media portrayal that CGI was 'jettisoned' from the business or was 'fired' by Obama distorts the fact that funding had all but run out for the contract,\" says TD Securities", "title": "Why CGI Group Inc.'s Obamacare contract loss is no big deal", "url": "http://business.financialpost.com/investing/why-cgi-group-inc-s-obamacare-contract-loss-is-no-big-deal", "image": "http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2013/12/cgi1.jpg?quality=60&strip=all", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "http://business.financialpost.com", "description": "\"The inflammatory media portrayal that CGI was 'jettisoned' from the business or was 'fired' by Obama distorts the fact that funding had all but run out for the contract,\" says TD Securities", "title": "Why CGI Group Inc.'s Obamacare contract loss is no big deal", "image": {"src": "http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2013/12/cgi1.jpg?quality=60&strip=all"}, "site": "@financialpost", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Just another WordPress.com site", "fb": {"admins": 576295511, "app_id": 138801856165024}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "Financial Post", "keywords": "investing, fp tech desk, accenture ltd., barack obama, centers for medicare & medicaid services, cgi group inc., patient protection and affordable care act", "google-site-verification": "UhYuz5WLj9O99xHz05IP4O2gExeR_rozYMFxe-OeqTg", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://business.financialpost.com/feed;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/b4ece3189893389a03f063830eacd95c?s=16"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7e1d\"", "article_summary": "Investors reacted negatively to news that the U.S. government will not be renewing its healthcare.gov contract with CGI Group Inc., but analysts view the impact as negligible.\nMr. Penner noted the original healthcare.gov contract announced by CGI on Dec. 1, 2011, was a two-year deal estimated to be worth US$93.7-million.\n\u201cGiven the speculated US$90-million contract value to Accenture, the dollar opportunity lost for CGI is negligible \u2014 US$90-million on a revenue base of $10-billion,\u201d he said.\nSo while admitting that the CMS contract is high profile, Mr. Kew said the loss will have little impact on CGI\u2019s long-term revenue and order backlog.\nThe analyst noted the healthcare.gov contract represents approximately 1% of CGI\u2019s 2013 revenue ($10.1-billion) and the total value of the two one-year extensions represents less than 0.5% of its current $18.7-billion backlog."}
