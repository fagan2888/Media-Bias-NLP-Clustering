After their last petition fell just a few dozen names short of making the November ballot, this time the group is narrowing the focus to first offenses for those 21 and older.\n\n\"If this is your first infraction for marijuana possession of 32 grams or less it will be a $50 fine and then the police don't have to haul you down to jail and they can just send you home with a ticket,\" said Esau Freeman from the initiative.\n\nSeveral newcomers from all sorts of backgrounds joined the meeting to learn about the new petition. One of them was Kelly Patton, she said doctors told her marijuana might be her last resort for pain treatment of a rare disease.\n\n\"We're not criminals, we're just patients and we need an alternative medication,\" said Patton.\n\nPatton and several others packed petition documents into envelopes as they prepare to ask for voter's signatures as they leave the polls on November 4. To get this reform to a vote in April, petitioners need to gather just over 2800 signatures, but even if the vote is won that doesn't mean reduced penalties are a done deal.\n\n\"We would need the help from the city council to make that official because only the city council can repeal an ordinance or change it,\" said Freeman.\n\nIt could take another vote and another year. Patton said that's the longest she can wait.\n\n\"We don't have a choice. If it doesn't work within the next two years with my health we have to move. And my physicians, they're all on board.\"\n\nPetitioners have until February 19 to turn in the necessary amount of signatures to make the April ballot.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "A new attempt to reduce marijuana penalties in Wichita is underway.", "language": "english", "author": "Ben Jordan", "og": {"description": "A new attempt to reduce marijuana penalties in Wichita is underway.", "title": "Marijuana reform supporters launch a new petition", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Marijuana-reform-supporters-launch-a-new-petition-279734372.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/C7F/E73/C7FE7367416F44038675D3641A04062E", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/21A/8F0/21A8F0D3E85941E68E5A938C74D9054E.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "A new attempt to reduce marijuana penalties in Wichita is underway.", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Marijuana-reform-supporters-launch-a-new-petition-279734372.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/Greenwood-County-marijuana-1.jpg", "title": "Marijuana reform supporters launch a new petition", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Marijuana reform supporters launch a new petition", "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Marijuana reform supporters launch a"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd9a2\"", "article_summary": "The Marijuana Reform Initiative held a meeting Sunday to launch a new petition drive aimed for the April ballot.\nCourtesy Greenwood County Sheriff's OfficeA new attempt to reduce marijuana penalties in Wichita is underway.\nSeveral newcomers from all sorts of backgrounds joined the meeting to learn about the new petition.\nOne of them was Kelly Patton, she said doctors told her marijuana might be her last resort for pain treatment of a rare disease.\nPatton and several others packed petition documents into envelopes as they prepare to ask for voter's signatures as they leave the polls on November 4."}
