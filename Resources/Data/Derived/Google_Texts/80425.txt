If you ended up with a bigger tax bill—or smaller refund—than usual this year, check out the capital gains distributions from your mutual funds in any brokerage accounts. Thanks to last year’s strong stock market, some funds paid out big distributions. If those funds are in a taxable account (versus an individual retirement account or 401(k) plan), you paid taxes on them, even if you reinvested the money.

What to do: Unless you have losses to offset your gains, dumping your tax-inefficient funds could trigger an even bigger bill next year. But you may want to direct future investments into funds that do a better job of keeping distributions in check. Index funds and exchange-traded funds are good choices for your taxable account.
