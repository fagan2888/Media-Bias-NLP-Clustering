Happy One Week Anniversary of the government shutdown, everyone! Woo-hoo! It’s been a fun ride, one that’s going great for the Republicans.

To mark the occasion, Anderson Cooper had Rep. Raul Labrador — one of the Republican congressmen responsible for the shutdown — on his show last night. When Labrador kept insisting that the American people don’t want Obamacare, Cooper shot back by saying, “You’re nullifying two presidential elections and you’re nullifying the vote of Congress because you don’t like it.” When Labrador complained about Cooper being hard on him, the Silver Fox gave him the rhetorical slap in the face he was virtually begging for.

“This is the way it works in journalism,” Cooper said. “When you’re not on Fox News, you get contentious interviews. When you’re not on MSNBC and a liberal, you get contentious interviews. My job is to ask you questions that are different than you think.”

Love u, Anderson.
