Mick Mulvaney, a Freedom Caucus member, in an interview with The Daily Signal.\n\n\u201cIt was even enjoyable to go to work this week, because at least we are giving voice to the people back home. [The highway bill] is a bill that\u2019s been cooked up the last several months, if not longer, so it\u2019s hard to imagine how Paul [Ryan] inserting himself would make it different. What little improvement we saw was a direct result of Paul\u2019s speakership.\u201d\n\nThat appreciation was seconded by Rep. Matt Salmon, R-Ariz., another Freedom Caucus member. \u201cIt was exactly what we were looking for,\u201d Salmon told The Daily Signal. \u201cWe were hoping for the process to be opened up and it was.\u201d\n\nMulvaney, R-S.C., probably more than anyone, got the full taste of Ryan\u2019s open House.\n\nOf the 126 amendments that lawmakers voted on this week related to the Highway Trust Fund, five of them were measures authored by Mulvaney \u2014 all meant to weaken the Export-Import Bank if reopened.\n\nEach of the amendments failed to pass, but Mulvaney isn\u2019t fretting \u2014 at least, he said, there was an opportunity to make a pitch for his ideas.\n\n\u201cI have no complaints whatsoever,\u201d Mulvaney said. \u201cIt was clear the will of the body was to revive the Ex-Im Bank. We got to have 80 minutes of debate on the floor about what\u2019s wrong with the bank, and why we think it should have been killed. That point would have never been made if not for those amendments. My folks back home don\u2019t like the bank very much. The grassroots don\u2019t like it at all. I was able to put some voice to their concerns. We lost, but we\u2019re not going to win every time, nor should you probably.\u201d\n\nStill, the amendment process on the highway bill was not completely open. Instead of allowing any amendment to be brought to the floor, House leaders, as has been typical, relied on the powerful Rules Committee to approve groups of amendments to be debated and voted on.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot better than [John] Boehner\u2019s system, but recent consideration of the highway bill fell far short of an open process,\u201d said Justin Amash, R-Mich., a Freedom Caucus member. \u201cAlmost without exception, the amendments placed in order made the bill less conservative, did practically nothing, or had no chance of passing.\u201d\n\nWhile the Freedom Caucus enjoyed its first taste of life under Ryan, R-Wis., its members also want more than a honeymoon.\n\nAfter all, some lawmakers remember how former Speaker John Boehner made similar promises \u2014 and even delivered on them, for a short time \u2014 allowing the House to vote on 100 amendments during the passing of an omnibus spending bill in 2011.\n\nBut conservatives later reviled Boehner, R-Ohio, for moving to tightly control the legislative process.\n\nWith that in mind, Freedom Caucus members will watch closely how Ryan handles an upcoming debate over spending bills to fund the government.\n\nJust before his Oct. 30 departure, Boehner helped negotiate a budget deal with President Barack Obama that set spending levels above the caps negotiated in 2011.\n\nCongress must still adopt spending bills by Dec. 11 that dictate where the money is spent.\n\nWith the deadline quickly approaching, conventional wisdom says that lawmakers will pursue a sweeping, all-encompassing omnibus spending measure that combines all the appropriations for the various agencies into one bill.\n\nIndividual spending bills have been difficult to pass in recent years; the House has approved six of 12 so far this year. Some House lawmakers, including Freedom Caucus members, want to restart the normal appropriations process to individually pass the six remaining spending bills.\n\nNo matter what the method ends up being, conservatives are vowing to include policy riders, including a measure to defund Planned Parenthood, to the spending bills.\n\n\u201cWe will approach the process very aggressively,\u201d Salmon said. \u201cOur focus will be to hold it up with every rider you can imagine. If we are not willing to use the power of the purse as the founding founders intended, what are we here for?\u201d\n\nFreedom Caucus members say Ryan is already starting the debate \u2014 and they like the way he\u2019s framing it.\n\nAt a Republican conference meeting on Thursday, Ryan told members that it will be entirely up to them to determine the way forward. He later told reporters, \u201cEvery member will have a chance to review each bill and give their input on their priorities.\u201d\n\n\u201cI get the very distinct impression Paul believes as much as I do in the primacy of the power of the purse,\u201d Mulvaney said.\n\n\u201cHe made it very clear that this is our job\u2014he will run the conference, and messaging, and be the boss, but the ideas are coming from the members.\u201d\n\nIn addition to trying to defund Planned Parenthood, conservatives will also look to move on other goals, such as reigning in the IRS and repealing environmental regulations.\n\nYet Freedom Caucus members, aware of their limitations, are also urging caution.\n\n\u201cWe cannot necessarily block the will of House,\u201d said Rep. John Fleming, R-La., in an interview with The Daily Signal. \u201cThat\u2019s not our job. It\u2019s to persuade our colleagues to do the right thing.\u201d\n\nIndeed, in Ryan\u2019s House, Freedom Caucus members just want a seat at the table. And while they are optimistic for now, they will wait to declare judgement on his service.\n\n\u201cThe proof will still be in the pudding,\u201d Mulvaney said. \u201cFor him, that means [how does he handle] the first issue that comes up entirely on his watch. It could be the appropriations bills, it could be the omnibus coming in December. Whatever is Paul\u2019s, and uniquely Paul\u2019s, needs to be better than what it would be if Boehner were speaker. That would be the very first gut check on how his speakership is going.\u201d\n\nThis story was updated to include new quotes from Rep.
