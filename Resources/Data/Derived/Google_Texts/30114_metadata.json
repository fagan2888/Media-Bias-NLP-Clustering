While the outbreak has now reached four countries, Liberia and Sierra Leone account for more than 60 percent of the deaths, according to the World Health Organization. The outbreak that emerged in March has claimed at least 932 lives.\n\nIn announcing the 90-day state of emergency, Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf said the worst recorded Ebola outbreak in history requires \u201cextraordinary measures for the very survival of our state and for the protection of the lives of our people.\u201d\n\n\u201cIgnorance, poverty, as well as entrenched religious and cultural practices continue to exacerbate the spread of the disease especially in the counties,\u201d Sirleaf said late Wednesday.\n\nShe warned that some civil liberties could be suspended as needed, and by Thursday soldiers already were restricting movements on the roads to the capital, Monrovia, witnesses said. Some soldiers were deployed to the crossroads town of Klay about 25 miles (40 kilometers) west of Monrovia in an effort to stop people from three Ebola-infected counties from coming closer to the capital.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Liberia, S.
