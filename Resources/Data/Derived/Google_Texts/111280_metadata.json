He died without even getting a chance to achieve this goal, as our country\u2019s laws back then didn\u2019t allow foreigners to become full Americans.\n\nWe shouldn\u2019t go back to such a time. But today, House Republicans are reconsidering denying newcomers the right to become citizens. If adopted, this law would vastly damage, not repair, our broken immigration system.\n\nThe ability to become a U.S. citizen is a cornerstone of the American Dream. Our heritage is as a nation of immigrants, not guest workers. Our legend is that America is the great melting pot.\n\nThe Statue of Liberty reads: \u201cGive me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free. The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me.\u201d It does not read: \u201cSend me the chosen few so that I can make them second-class citizens.\u201d\n\nCitizenship is keenly important to Asian-Americans. Asians were the first \u201caliens\u201d in the United States. Prior to 1882, any person entering the country was considered a citizen. Chinese and Japanese immigrants were the first to be denied citizenship for their lifetime.\n\nCreating two classes of Americans \u2014 citizens and legalized workers with no hope of achieving citizenship \u2014would return this country to a time when Chinese \u201ccoolies\u201d could build the railroads for a country that would never truly accept them.\n\nLet\u2019s not go there.\n\nAsian immigrants seek citizenship more frequently than others. We have the highest percentage of foreign-born members of the population. Asian immigrants also have the highest naturalization rate \u2014 57 percent \u2014 of any minority group. We want to put down roots and become true Americans.\n\nWe rely on family visas more than any other ethnic group, and our loved ones wait longer than most to enter this country.\n\nWe are the fastest-growing minority group in America, and we want immigration reform now. This reform must include a pathway to citizenship for the 11 million undocumented immigrants, for individuals who have waited in line abroad for decades and for future aspiring citizens.\n\nProviding immigrants a pathway to citizenship is not just morally the right thing to do; it is also good for our economy. Today 11 million aspiring citizens live in the United States. They pay taxes and are a large part of our work force. They are consumers fueling demand. Immigrants from the world over have made this country thrive. It is time we embrace our nation\u2019s diversity and create a system that allows all immigrants a pathway to citizenship.\n\nIf he were still with us, it would make my grandfather proud.\n\nPriscilla Ouchida is the executive director of the Japanese American Citizens League and an executive committee member of the National Council of Asian Pacific Americans.
