The website has obliged with the cease and desist order, apologized, and posted a retraction.\n\nThe retraction says: \"We sincerely apologize to Bieber for the hit to his ego and to the millions of tweens on social media we upset: Swag swag swag, on you. Chillin\u2019 by the fire while we eatin\u2019 fondue.\" (A play on Bieber's hit song \"Boyfriend.\")\n\nBreatheHeavy.com's original post also claimed Bieber was a nightmare on set, trying to hit on fellow model Lara Stone repeatedly throughout the shoot.\n\nHowever, Calvin Klein's chief marketing officer Melissa Goldie told Us Magazine he was the complete opposite.\n\nGoldie said: \"Justin showed up early every day with amazing energy; he completely trusted us and gave it his all.\"\n\nShe added: \"Lara [Stone] definitely gave Justin some modeling pointers, especially when we shot the print images, but when we started to shoot the commercial, Justin had some pointers for Lara... He came alive when it was time to perform, especially when the drum kit came out \u2014 it was really impressive.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Bieber's personal trainer Patrick Nilsson, has also leapt to the defense of the popstar over the photos.\n\nHe, somewhat bizarrely, told Access Hollywood: \"I can definitely confirm [Justin] is a well-endowed guy. I sound weird saying that, but yes.\"\n\nYou said it.\n\nBusiness Insider has contacted Calvin Klein again to ascertain whether the images posted by BreatheHeavy.com were in fact genuine. This article will be updated if a response is received.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#185f7c", "sailthru.author": "Lara O'Reilly", "application-name": "Business Insider", "twitter": {"description": "He really is that sculpted, Bieber's entourage says.", "creator": "larakiara", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/justin-bieber-says-un-retouched-calvin-klein-photo-is-fake-2015-1", "image": "http://static2.businessinsider.com/image/54b23ed26bb3f7b53e36bd2c-506-253/team-bieber-says-bieber-is-just-as-buff-and-well-endowed-as-he-looks-in-this-calvin-klein-ad.jpg", "title": "Team Bieber Says Bieber Is Just As Buff And Well-Endowed As He Looks In This Calvin Klein Ad", "site": "BI_Advertising", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.verticals": "advertising,thewire,retail", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "sailthru.tags": "Justin Bieber, Calvin Klein, Photoshop, Lara O'Reilly,", "description": "He really is that sculpted, Bieber's entourage says.", "author": "Lara O'Reilly", "sailthru.date": "2015-01-11", "sailthru.title": "Team Bieber Says Bieber Is Just As Buff And Well-Endowed As He Looks In This Calvin Klein Ad", "theme-color": "#185f7c", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://static4.businessinsider.com/image/54b23ec56bb3f7dc4536bd2b-50-50/team-bieber-says-bieber-is-just-as-buff-and-well-endowed-as-he-looks-in-this-calvin-klein-ad.jpg", "news_keywords": "Justin Bieber, Calvin Klein, Photoshop, Lara O'Reilly,", "tbi-image": "http://static4.businessinsider.com/image/54b23ec56bb3f7dc4536bd2b/team-bieber-says-bieber-is-just-as-buff-and-well-endowed-as-he-looks-in-this-calvin-klein-ad.jpg", "fb": {"app_id": 155043519637}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/assets/images/us/favicons/mstile-144x144.png?v=BI-US-2016-03-31", "date": "2015-01-11", "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider", "author": "http://www.businessinsider.com/author/lara-oreilly"}, "sailthru.description": "He really is that sculpted, Bieber's entourage says.", "viewport": "width=1024", "og": {"site_name": "Business Insider", "description": "He really is that sculpted, Bieber's entourage says.", "title": "Team Bieber Says Bieber Is Just As Buff And Well-Endowed As He Looks In This Calvin Klein Ad", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/justin-bieber-says-un-retouched-calvin-klein-photo-is-fake-2015-1", "image": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/54b23ed26bb3f7b53e36bd2c-1190-625/team-bieber-says-bieber-is-just-as-buff-and-well-endowed-as-he-looks-in-this-calvin-klein-ad.jpg", "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Business Insider", "title": "Team Bieber Says Bieber Is Just As Buff And Well-Endowed As He Looks In This Calvin Klein Ad", "sailthru.image.full": "http://static4.businessinsider.com/image/54b23ec56bb3f7dc4536bd2b/team-bieber-says-bieber-is-just-as-buff-and-well-endowed-as-he-looks-in-this-calvin-klein-ad.jpg", "tbi-vertical": "advertising"}, "article_summary": "The retraction says: \"We sincerely apologize to Bieber for the hit to his ego and to the millions of tweens on social media we upset: Swag swag swag, on you.\nBusiness Insider has contacted Calvin Klein again to ascertain whether the images posted by BreatheHeavy.com were in fact genuine.\n(A play on Bieber's hit song \"Boyfriend.\")\nGoldie said: \"Justin showed up early every day with amazing energy; he completely trusted us and gave it his all.\"\nBreatheHeavy.com's original post also claimed Bieber was a nightmare on set, trying to hit on fellow model Lara Stone repeatedly throughout the shoot."}
