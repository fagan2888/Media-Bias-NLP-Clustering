Cornwall Council has paid out more than £8,000 to rent back council houses it recently sold under the right-to-buy scheme, it had emerged.

An investigation by The Independent showed the council was among at least 32 authorities having to shell out for properties they once owned outright.

The figures, released under the Freedom of Information Act, have fuelled fears that the Government’s new scheme to encourage councils to sell their properties is allowing social housing to be exploited for commercial gain.

Cornwall Council said it had sold 74 homes since the Government revamped the right-to-buy scheme in 2012.

It confirmed it was now paying housing benefit on five of those households and had paid out £8,613.57 between April 2012 and August of this year.

Now figures were available for Devon authorities. But in the London borough of Haringey, the authority is now renting back 28 of the 396 homes it has sold under right-to-buy at a cost of more than £265,000 a year.

Campaigners said the figures from just 33 councils, could be the tip of the iceberg.

Rachel Fisher, head of policy at the National Housing Federation, said: “Right to buy has decimated the supply of affordable homes to rent at a time when we have a major housing crisis and a real problem of affordability.

“Social housing should be reserved for those who need it most but right to buy is perpetuating the belief that homes are an investment rather than somewhere to live.”

Housing minister Brandon Lewis, however, defended the scheme which was first introduced by Margaret Thatcher.

“Right to buy helps social tenants get on to the housing ladder, increases housing construction and reduces social-housing waiting lists,” he said. “Every additional home sold will be replaced with a new affordable home.”
