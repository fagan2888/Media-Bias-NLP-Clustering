Carter-Brooks has come under a firestorm of criticism after securing her 1-month-old infant to the bottom of her dress while she walked down the aisle during her wedding ceremony.\n\nAfter posting photos of her controversial decision to strap her newborn to the bottom of her dress, Shona and her husband Jonathan Brooks were met with public outrage. Critics deemed her act \u201ctruly stupid\u201d and \u201cincredible dangerous.\u201d Carter-Brooks defended her actions via a series of social media posts declaring that \u201cwe had our hearts in Christ which covers all!!\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople questioning what we do, commenting all negative, and just doing the most. We good though we covered by the Blood which never loose its power,\u201d Carter-Brooks said in a Facebook post this past Thursday. \u201cSo to the media, radio, news, and whomever else wanting to talk about what WE do here you go: Media Media I see how it works regardless the situation or purpose people gone have something negative to say! The answer is we do what we want when we want long as Jesus on our side everything worked out fine and gone continue to be fine. Our 1 month old was awake and well secured on my train.\u201d\n\nAlthough the dangers of dragging a 1-month-old newborn down the aisle of a wedding ceremony should be well understood, it\u2019s worth noting what exposing a child that young to a crowd in close quarters can mean for his or her health. Experts agree there is no medical reason to keep parents from taking their newborn out of the house at around one month. However, they should avoid exposing their child to unwanted germs due to a newborn\u2019s underdeveloped immune system.\n\nInfants should be kept away from anyone who is sick and people asking to hold a newborn should be advised to wash their hands before even touching a baby. Above all, parents should refrain from subjecting a newborn to areas that may be carrying germs that can be detrimental to the child\u2019s health \u2014 the floor of a public church being one of them.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "bride, newborn, wedding, dress", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Newlyweds share photo of their 1-month-old newborn being dragged down the aisle on the back of the bride's wedding dress.
