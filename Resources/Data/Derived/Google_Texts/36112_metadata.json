Jed Jacobsohn/Getty Images\n\nIt was a sad day Thursday, when pop superstar Prince passed away after a bout of flu. While authorities still aren\u2019t sure what exactly caused his death, a rep for the singer confirmed he was sick for several weeks, at times incapacitated to the point he had to cancel dates for his \"Piano & a Microphone\" tour.\n\nPrince has struggled with his health before. In 2009, he told PBS that he suffered from epilepsy as a child and has experienced hip problems throughout his career. Prince\u2019s popularity was anchored in his unique style, catchy hits, and flashy persona, but could these qualities have been influenced by his disorder?\n\nPrince himself once said his colorful onstage personality was a way to compensate for his illness. It's no surprise then, as Slate correspondent Katy Waldman pointed out, his songs often evoked \"a hallucinatory scene\" and \"invited you into an altered state of consciousness.\" Some experts and patients suggest epilepsy can spur creative impulses in the brain, where the chronic disorder originates.\n\nThe disorder is marked by abnormal electrical impulses capable of causing seizures and altering movement, behavior, sensation, and awareness; these seizures are often unprovoked and recurrent. Though it is usually mood disorders that are associated with creativity, epilepsy has been attributed as the source of many famous artists\u2019 imaginative sensibilities.\n\nSeizures can be so powerful that they provoke hallucinations and intense sensations of fear, fury, or even joy.\n\n\"One major theory is that hallucinations are caused when something goes wrong in the relationship between the brain's frontal lobe and the sensory cortex,\" neuropsychologist Flavie Waters, a professor at the University of Western Australia,\" told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). Hallucinations are thought to occur in people with schizophrenia and LSD users, but ABC reported almost two out of three people have benign hallucinations. To those in the arts, these feelings can serve as powerful inspiration.\n\nComedian and actor Dan Mitchell suffers from epilepsy, and said that his seizures did just that.\n\n\u201cThat shake up of the mind\u2026often gives me strange ideas, vivid images, words connected bizarrely \u2014 as if someone had emptied the toy box of my mind and joined together bits of mental Lego and a Rubik\u2019s cube and produced something that no one had seen before,\u201d he wrote for The Guardian.\n\nOther deeply talented artists such as Edgar Allan Poe and Vincent van Gogh may have suffered from temporal lobe epilepsy, a type of epilepsy in which abnormal impulses begin in the area of the brain associated with visual memory, language comprehension, and emotional association. After developing this form of the condition, some people develop visual artistic abilities.\n\nThe creativity, however, may dampen if a patient chooses to control their epileptic seizures with medication.\n\n\u201cThe big ideas have also stopped,\u201d Mitchel wrote of his decision to begin taking medication. \u201cThe weird and colorful connections that made my work different have seemingly dried up. It could be writers block or it could be coincidence, but I suspect that it has something to do with the meds.\u201d\n\nMitchel added that he doesn\u2019t know if he\u2019s willing to risk stability of health for the wild ideas that accompanied his seizures, a question that may plague many epileptic artists.\n\nIt\u2019s very possible that Prince not only consciously drew inspiration from his epilepsy, but that he did so subconsciously as well. Unfortunately, the condition may have also played a role in his death: those with neurological conditions are more likely to fall victim to complications if they catch a flu. It\u2019s unclear whether or not he was controlling the condition at the time of his death, but regardless of if his epilepsy contributed to his creativity, Prince\u2019s success will not soon be forgotten.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "could, princes, epilepsy, have, contributed, his, creativity, how, seizure, disorder, can", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Some\u00a0experts and patients suggest epilepsy can spur creative impulses in the brain.", "title": "Could Prince's Epilepsy Have Contributed To His Creativity?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/prince-rogers-nelson-epilepsy-seizure-disorder-creative-thinking-383197", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/04/23/prince-image.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Some\u00a0experts and patients suggest epilepsy can spur creative impulses in the brain.", "title": "Could Prince's Epilepsy Have Contributed To His Creativity?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/prince-rogers-nelson-epilepsy-seizure-disorder-creative-thinking-383197", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/04/23/prince-image.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/04/23/prince-image.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Under the Hood", "published_time": "2016-04-23T17:03:40-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-23T23:04:45-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Some\u00a0experts and patients suggest epilepsy can spur creative impulses in the brain."}, "article_summary": "Though it is usually mood disorders that are associated with creativity, epilepsy has been attributed as the source of many famous artists\u2019 imaginative sensibilities.\nSome experts and patients suggest epilepsy can spur creative impulses in the brain, where the chronic disorder originates.\nIt\u2019s unclear whether or not he was controlling the condition at the time of his death, but regardless of if his epilepsy contributed to his creativity, Prince\u2019s success will not soon be forgotten.\nIt\u2019s very possible that Prince not only consciously drew inspiration from his epilepsy, but that he did so subconsciously as well.\nPrince\u2019s popularity was anchored in his unique style, catchy hits, and flashy persona, but could these qualities have been influenced by his disorder?"}
