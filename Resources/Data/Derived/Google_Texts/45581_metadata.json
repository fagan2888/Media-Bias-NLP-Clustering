Shut the door, locked the doors and the PODS company picked it up the morning of the second,\u201d Wagnon said.\n\nShe said she rented the unit to store her stuff until her new home was ready to be lived in and she wasn\u2019t expecting that any time soon. So, she was surprised when she got a call from the storage company Thursday and was asked an interesting question.\n\n\"He said, 'Are you missing a cat?' and I happened to be driving my daughter to school this morning and I said I don't have a cat and my daughter immediately said 'That's Donut!'\"\n\nDonut, the neighborhood cat, had called their old next door neighbors\u2019 house a home but decided the moving POD was cozier -- only to be locked inside for three weeks.\n\nJenny said it all happened fast. She drove to pick up Donut and brought her back to her real home near Edmond, and to the waiting arms of 10-year-old Lily Scogin.\n\n\u201cWhen she came back, I was like, wow.\u201d Lily said, giggling as she put her hands to her cheeks.\n\n\u201cWe thought maybe she found a new home or what,\u201d Lily\u2019s mother Laura Scogin said. \u201c[Donut] just disappeared and didn't come back.\u201d\n\nSo when Jenny called and told them the story, they were more than welcome to have Donut back to fill the hole she had left.\n\nBut the question for the Scogins was how did Donut last that long?\n\n\u201cThe vet said that she probably licked the moisture off of the insides of the walls to stay hydrated and it kept her alive,\u201d Laura Scogin said.\n\nThe veterinarian told the Scogins they needed to give Donut a tablespoon of water every half hour and were only allowed to feed her a quarter can of food to prevent her from being sick. They also said they were told to keep their newly returned pet in a carrying crate so she can \u201cre-acclimate\u201d to living outside the pod. They expect her to be back to normal in three to four days.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "When Jenny Wagnon loaded her things into storage she thought it'd be an easy move.", "author": "Grant Hermes", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/31027315/edmond-cat-survives-being-locked-inside-storage-unit-for-3-weeks", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/9701691_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "When Jenny Wagnon loaded her things into storage she thought it'd be an easy move.", "title": "Edmond Cat Survives Being Locked Inside Storage Unit For 3 Weeks"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/9701691_G.jpg", "description": "When Jenny Wagnon loaded her things into storage she thought it'd be an easy move.", "card": "summary", "title": "Edmond Cat Survives Being Locked Inside Storage Unit For 3 Weeks"}, "wnreadableurl": "edmond-cat-survives-being-locked-inside-storage-unit-for-3-weeks", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "date": "2016/01/21", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "owner": "KWTV", "KEYWORDS": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,newsok,channel 9,channel nine,news 9,television,this morning,live radar,kwtv,sports,video,live streaming,interactive", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS03", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,newsok,channel 9,channel nine,news 9,television,this morning,live radar,kwtv,sports,video,live streaming,interactive"}, "article_summary": "When Jenny Wagnon loaded her things into storage she thought it'd be an easy move.\nShut the door, locked the doors and the PODS company picked it up the morning of the second,\u201d Wagnon said.\nSo, she was surprised when she got a call from the storage company Thursday and was asked an interesting question.\nDonut, the neighborhood cat, had called their old next door neighbors\u2019 house a home but decided the moving POD was cozier -- only to be locked inside for three weeks.\n\u201cWhen she came back, I was like, wow.\u201d Lily said, giggling as she put her hands to her cheeks."}
