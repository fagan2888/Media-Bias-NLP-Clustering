Clyde Reed, pastor of Good News Presbyterian Church in Gilbert, puts up a sign a day after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in his church's favor against the Town of Gilbert (Photo: Alliance Defending Freedom)\n\nWhat exactly does Alliance Defending Freedom do?\n\nAlliance Defending Freedom is an alliance-building legal organization that advocates for the right of people to freely live out their faith. Recognizing the need for a strong, coordinated legal defense against growing attacks on religious freedom, ADF launched in 1994.\n\nOver the past 20 years, we have brought together thousands of attorneys and like-minded organizations that work tirelessly to advocate for the right of people to freely live out their faith in America and around the world.\n\nYou won the Gilbert church signs case. What other high-profile cases have you handled?\n\nMost of our cases deal with protecting the sanctity of life, freedom of conscience and religious liberty. We handle each as if they were high-profile cases because they protect Americans' most basic freedoms of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\n\nRight now we are handling a number of cases in which the government is telling our clients to either give up their deeply held beliefs or face jail time, huge fines and massive fees. Pastor Reed's case is really one of freedom of speech, and we have won a number of cases in which schools and universities have tried to limit student speech because the message was unpopular.\n\nRecently we have taken on the fight against government coercion of churches, ministries and family business owners to subsidize abortion through Obamacare mandates. For more information, people can go to www.alliancedefendingfreedom.org.\n\nIs there a common theme in your cases?\n\nFreedom in the United States begins with the First Amendment of the Constitution, which recognizes our freedom to speak, believe and live according to our conscience. Alliance Defending Freedom wins cases that protect the First Amendment for all Americans. Most often we protect it from the encroachment of government.\n\nWhat does the Fourth of July mean to you?\n\nBob Trent, media relations director for Alliance Defending Freedom (Photo: handout)\n\nThe Fourth of July celebrates our declaration as a people that we are all created with freedoms endowed by our Creator. On July 4, 1776, our Founding Fathers announced their intention to create a completely new form of government that derives its power from the consent of the governed. The primary use of that power would be to protect the inherent freedoms of the people, not for the government to limit them. In a time of kings and tyranny, this was a revolutionary idea.\n\nWhere would you rate the state of freedom in the U.S. today? What is its greatest threat?\n\nCourt decisions and bad laws can certainly be a threat to freedom, but the greatest threat is when Americans forget what freedom is and allow it to slip away. Right now, it seems too many people are bystanders as one group or another tries to elevate its own freedom and belief at the expense and submission of others.\n\nWhat is the best assurance that freedom will stand?\n\nThe best assurance that freedom will stand is for Americans to remember that their own freedom is dependent upon allowing others to live and act according to their beliefs.\n\nFreedom is both a blessing and a responsibility that we all share. Not enough people take the time to understand the God-given nature of our freedom and government's role in recognizing and protecting it.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://azc.cc/1M0exSI", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Into the Mind: Bob Trent, media relations director for Alliance Defending Freedom, weighs in on the practical side of freedom.", "og": {"site_name": "azcentral", "description": "Into the Mind: Bob Trent, media relations director for Alliance Defending Freedom, weighs in on the practical side of freedom.", "title": "Why freedom matters on this Independence Day", "url": "http://www.azcentral.com/story/opinion/op-ed/2015/07/03/freedom-matters-independence-day/29630957/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/azcentral.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Into the Mind: Bob Trent, media relations director for Alliance Defending Freedom, weighs in on the practical side of freedom.", "title": "Why freedom matters on this Independence Day", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/dab110de8f479ee44c40dfe25f326b42ecc2566c/c=408-0-2856-2448&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/06/19/Phoenix/Phoenix/635703409429693865-image1.jpeg", "creator": "@azcentral", "site": "@azcentral", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600023563", "fb": {"app_id": 115142145268769}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Events/Fourth of July", "gci-categories": "Events/Fourth of July", "gci-asset-type": "story", "title": "Why freedom matters on this Independence Day", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "opinion/op-ed", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/06ba27a0362a386e9000c02e5ad114cc3f2d85e9/c=714-0-2550-2448/local/-/media/2015/06/19/Phoenix/Phoenix/635703409429693865-image1.jpeg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/70261845367a788a3f907a9f1f073a9c7298db27/c=408-0-2856-2448/local/-/media/2015/06/19/Phoenix/Phoenix/635703409429693865-image1.jpeg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/519e70b3dd198a728f9efe74a59e76efcbe622d3/c=4-0-3260-2448/local/-/media/2015/06/19/Phoenix/Phoenix/635703409429693865-image1.jpeg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/abf7fc9e077790e137c6a86512b8396963a5a375/c=0-302-3264-2146&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2015/06/19/Phoenix/Phoenix/635703409429693865-image1.jpeg", "publishtime": "2015-07-03T16:45:35.300000-07:00", "shorthed": "Into the Mind: Why freedom matters", "articleid": 29630957, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6d46f0a03148c87ce3989a311abc6d55d0153ee9/c=0-302-3264-2146/local/-/media/2015/06/19/Phoenix/Phoenix/635703409429693865-image1.jpeg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/80bc2c6d6bcf6351394bb3af892ba4acb199efd5/c=947-0-2318-2448/local/-/media/2015/06/19/Phoenix/Phoenix/635703409429693865-image1.jpeg"}}, "news_keywords": "into the mind, into the mind azcentral, alliance defending freedom, why freedom matters, fourth of july,"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd180d\"", "article_summary": "Into the Mind: Bob Trent, media relations director for Alliance Defending Freedom, weighs in on the practical side of freedom.\nAlliance Defending Freedom is an alliance-building legal organization that advocates for the right of people to freely live out their faith.\nClyde Reed, pastor of Good News Presbyterian Church in Gilbert, puts up a sign a day after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in his church's favor against the Town of Gilbert (Photo: Alliance Defending Freedom)What exactly does Alliance Defending Freedom do?\nAlliance Defending Freedom wins cases that protect the First Amendment for all Americans.\nBob Trent, media relations director for Alliance Defending Freedom (Photo: handout)The Fourth of July celebrates our declaration as a people that we are all created with freedoms endowed by our Creator."}
