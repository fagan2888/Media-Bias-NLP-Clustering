JOE RAEDLE/GETTY IMAGES\n\nThe number of job openings in the U.S. fell slightly in June but remained at a level suggesting strong demand for workers.\n\nJob openings slipped to 5.25 million in June, down from a record 5.36 million in May, according to the Labor Department\u2019s Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, known as Jolts.\n\nHires climbed to the highest level of the year at 5.12 million and the number of Americans voluntarily quitting their jobs climbed to 2.75 million from 2.73 million the prior month. The number of voluntary quits tends to rise when people are confident about job prospects.\n\nAnother 1.79 million people were laid off or discharged in June, down from 1.66 million in May.\n\n\u201cIn other words, labor demand is still rising very rapidly, and is hugely elevated relative to the unemployment rate,\u201d Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said in a note to clients.\n\nThe main jobs report, out earlier this month, showed the unemployment rate at 5.3% in July and June. Nonfarm payrolls rose a seasonally adjusted 215,000 in July and 231,000 the prior month. The initial employment situation report only shows net job gains or losses, while the Jolts report offers additional details on the total number of hires, openings and separations.\n\nBoth reports are closely followed by officials at the Federal Reserve. Chairwoman Janet Yellen has said the rate of voluntary quitting is a key gauge of workers\u2019 confidence in the economy. When the economy is stronger, workers are more likely to quit their jobs because it\u2019s easier to find something elsewhere.\n\nIn recent months, the number of quits has held fairly steady and a gap between job openings and hires has opened, a mismatch that suggests employers haven\u2019t been able to find workers with the desired skills at the salary on offer.\n\n\u201cWhile growth in job openings has cooled off in recent months, the key takeaway should be that the underlying health of the labor market continues to improve,\u201d said Jeremy Schwartz, an associate at Credit Suisse. \u201cThe ratio of vacancies to unemployed workers continues to rise and is near precrisis peaks.\u201d\n\nStill, businesses haven\u2019t responded with significantly higher wages. That may be because there\u2019s still a ready pool of workers.\n\nDespite 58 consecutive months of rising payrolls, 8.3 million workers were looking for a job but couldn\u2019t find one in July, while others had given up looking or were stuck in part-time jobs but would have preferred a full-time position.\n\nAnd the share of Americans participating in the labor force, at 62.6% in July, matched the lowest reading since 1977, a possible sign there\u2019s a mismatch between job openings and job seekers.\n\nRelated reading:\n\nThe July Jobs Report in 12 Charts\n\nSo the Job Market Is Strong, But There\u2019s Still Plenty of Slack\n\nU.S. Job Openings Remain at Historic Highs\n\nJob Openings Rise to Record", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "The number of job openings in the U.S. fell slightly in June, though the overall level suggests demand for workers remains strong.", "title": "U.S. Job Openings in June Fall a Bit From Record Highs", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2015/08/12/u-s-job-openings-down-slightly-in-june/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-JV081_job_se_P_20150812100606.jpg"}, "site": "WSJecon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Economy", "article.headline": "U.S. Job Openings in June Fall a Bit From Record Highs", "description": "The number of job openings in the U.S. fell slightly in June, though the overall level suggests demand for workers remains strong.", "article_section": "Economy", "author": "Jeffrey Sparshott", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Real Time Economics Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Real Time Economics", "article.summary": "The number of job openings in the U.S. fell slightly in June, though the overall level suggests demand for workers remains strong.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2015-08-12T14:14:18-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-143", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2015/08/12/u-s-job-openings-down-slightly-in-june/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-REB-33788", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Economy", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "The number of job openings in the U.S. fell slightly in June, though the overall level suggests demand for workers remains strong.", "title": "U.S. Job Openings in June Fall a Bit From Record Highs", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2015/08/12/u-s-job-openings-down-slightly-in-june/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-JV081_job_se_P_20150812100606.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Real Time Economics", "article.id": "BL-REB-33788", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-08-12T16:16:59-04:00"}, "article_summary": "Job openings slipped to 5.25 million in June, down from a record 5.36 million in May, according to the Labor Department\u2019s Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, known as Jolts.\nRelated reading:The July Jobs Report in 12 ChartsSo the Job Market Is Strong, But There\u2019s Still Plenty of SlackU.S. Job Openings Remain at Historic HighsJob Openings Rise to Record\nJob openings registered at 5.25 million in June, down from 5.36 million in May.\nJOE RAEDLE/GETTY IMAGESThe number of job openings in the U.S. fell slightly in June but remained at a level suggesting strong demand for workers.\nThe main jobs report, out earlier this month, showed the unemployment rate at 5.3% in July and June."}
