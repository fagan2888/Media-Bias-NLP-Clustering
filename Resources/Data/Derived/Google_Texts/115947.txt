Longmont officials are inviting residents to a Saturday, Oct. 11, grand opening celebration for the city's newest park, Dry Creek Community Park located at 1251 Grandview Meadows Drive.

The 10 a.m. event will include an award presentation from the Colorado Lottery and Great Outdoors Colorado, which provided $700,000 to support the park's development. Longmont's Mayor and City Council will cut a ceremonial ribbon to officially opening the park.

Festivities are to continue until noon, including such special activities as balloon art and face painting, a raffle to win an annual city recreation pass, giveaways and snacks.

City officials said the new park provides a multi-tiered and Americans with Disabilities Act-accessible playground, restrooms, parking, walking paths and a Dry Creek Greenway trail connection from Grandview Meadows Drive to Blue Skies Park, as well as an 18-hole disc golf course and a sledding hill.

A future multi-use sports field, including cricket pitches, will remain off-limits, however, until spring 2015 as new grass is established.

Dry Creek Community Park was named for the creek running through it. The city bought the land in 2003 and a master plan completed in 2008.e a vision for the park. People can learn more about Dry Creek Community Park online at www.LongmontColorado.gov/parks or can call (303) 651-8446.
