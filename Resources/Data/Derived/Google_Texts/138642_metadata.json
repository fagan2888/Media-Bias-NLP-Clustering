They say that administrators neglected to consider student feedback when designing the new program, which gives students different options \u2014 like submitting reflection pieces about a TED talk or attending a one-hour workshop \u2014 to fulfill the education requirement.\n\nMichela Weihl, a student at Columbia\u2019s sister school Barnard and one of the No Red Tape organizers, told ThinkProgress via email that \u201cit has become abundantly clear to us that the issue they truly care about is one of public relations, not student safety.\u201d\n\nNo Red Tape suggests that parents and teens could ask for more information regarding the school\u2019s current consent and rape prevention education programs by inquiring, \u201cColumbia raises millions of dollars each year and currently has a $9 billion endowment. Why can\u2019t Columbia afford to pay trained professionals to develop and lead ongoing, mandatory prevention education workshops?\u201d\n\nFor prospective students who have concerns about the temporary suspensions handed out to students found guilty of rape, the letter suggests asking, \u201cWhy does Columbia want rapists to remain on campus?\u201d\n\nAnother suggestion is simply to ask, \u201cWill I be safe on this campus?\u201d\n\nLast year, a group of 23 Columbia students filed a federal complaint accusing their university of mishandling rape cases. Since then, the university has been at the forefront of student activism regarding sexual assault.\n\nFrustrated by what they perceived as lack of action from university administrators, students have taken matters into their own hands. Over the past year, activists scrawled the names of accused rapists on bathroom walls and hung red tape around the campus. No Red Tape has repeatedly attempted to protest prospective student events. And senior Emma Sulkowicz has made national headlines for her thesis project in performing arts, which involves carrying her mattress \u2014 where she says she was raped \u2014 as long as her alleged assailant remains enrolled at Columbia.\n\nColumbia University\u2019s president, meanwhile, has resisted allegations that the school isn\u2019t doing enough to improve its policies in this area. Last October, he penned an op-ed in the New Republic pledging to \u201csustain the effort to make our campuses safer over the long term and to encourage and train students to contribute thoughtfully to these changes in their own communities.\u201d\n\nOutside of Columbia, there\u2019s been a lot of conversation about what role prospective students might play in the ongoing push back to the way colleges are approaching issues of sexual violence.\n\nLast spring, the feminist group UltraViolet ran ads warning prospective students against enrolling in several prominent schools under federal investigation for allegedly mishandling rape cases. The idea is that, if more high schoolers grow concerned about these issues, schools may see their admissions numbers take a hit \u2014 something that could spur school administrators to improve their policies. Anecdotally, after Dartmouth College was plagued with sexual assault controversies over the past year, the applications to the prestigious New Hampshire school dropped 14 percent.\n\nAlong the same lines, advocates have also been pushing to update college ranking systems to include more information about sexual assault, arguing that every prospective college student deserves to know whether their future schools are safe. Some school officials actually share that position, too. One recent poll found that 61 percent of admissions officers believe that information about rape policies should be included in the influential U.S. News & World Report rankings.\n\n\u201cFinding out what colleges are proactively doing to end sexual and dating violence on their campuses is an important part of figuring out which college is the best choice for your future,\u201d concludes No Red Tape\u2019s letter to prospective Columbia students.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "They're urging high schoolers to ask university officials, \"Will I be safe here?\"", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "They're urging high schoolers to ask university officials, \"Will I be safe here?\"", "title": "Activists Warn Prospective Students That Universities Are Bad At Stopping Rape", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2015/02/10/3621353/prospective-college-students-rape-columbia/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/lightened.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "They're urging high schoolers to ask university officials, \"Will I be safe here?\"", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/lightened-321x214.jpg", "title": "Activists Warn Prospective Students That Universities Are Bad At Stopping Rape", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/lightened.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/lightened.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-10T12:19:07+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cAs prospective students, we know you care about attending a college which prioritizes your safety,\u201d the letter states.\nHealth Activists Warn Prospective Students That Universities Are Bad At Stopping Rape CREDIT: Courtesy of No Red Tape Columbia University students protesting at an event for prospective studentsStudents at Columbia University want high schoolers to ask some hard questions as they consider whether they want to enroll in the Ivy League school next fall.\nOver the past year, activists scrawled the names of accused rapists on bathroom walls and hung red tape around the campus.\nLast spring, the feminist group UltraViolet ran ads warning prospective students against enrolling in several prominent schools under federal investigation for allegedly mishandling rape cases.\nNo Red Tape has repeatedly attempted to protest prospective student events."}
