Dave Reichert, R-Wash., served as a hostage negotiator.\n\nThese days, however, the one Puget Sound-area Republican congressman is steering clear from harm's way -- the danger of having to face critical questions.\n\nA request from this news organization for a schedule of his August recess appearances was ignored. A major Seattle-Tacoma radio station tried repeatedly to reach him to talk about Thursday's Republican-led House vote to slash food stamps. Its calls were not returned.\n\nThe food stamp vote was a gut challenge: An independent, fair-play Republican should have stood tall, like a sheriff. The cuts, demanded by Tea Party extremists of the far right, were a massively unfair $40 billion over 10 years.\n\nIn a Los Angeles Times op-ed which he coauthored, former Republican Senate leader (and 1996 presidential nominee) Bob Dole spoke up:\n\n\"The latest proposal from the House is an about-face on our progress fighting hunger. It would eliminate food assistance for 4 million to 6 million Americans. If Congress lets this bill fall victim to the misguided and detrimental partisan politics we face today, the results for families and children challenged with hunger will be severe.\"\n\nJoel Connelly has been a staff columnist for more than 30 years.

He comments regularly on politics and public policy.\n\nYet, on the 217-210 vote, Reichert voted with the Republican leadership and the Tea Party. Fifteen of his Republican colleagues had the courage to say no.\n\nIn January, Reichert told the Seattle Times how glad he was to chair a subcommittee overseeing food stamps, because the program helps people \"in difficult times.\"\n\nA day later, Reichert voted for a proposal to fund the federal government through mid-December. The price: Stop implementation of the Affordable Care Act, which has begun in the state of Washington and will extend coverage to thousands more people.\n\nWhat gives? Don't ask Reichert. He issues rote statements on such topics as the 66th birthday of the U.S. Air Force and the 226th anniversary of the U.S. Constitution. Nothing on food stamps. Nothing on defunding health care reform.\n\nThe Washington State Redistricting Commission may have done us a massive disfavor when they redrew our state's congressional boundary lines, and created a 10th U.S. House district.\n\nThey extended Reichert's 8th Congressional District across the mountains to include reliably Republican turf in Kittitas and Chelan Counties.\n\nInstead of a marginal constituency -- where he had to run hard for four terms -- Reichert now has a safe district. Democratic Rep. Rick Larsen was given safe turf in Northwest Washington. So was Republican Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler in Southwest Washington.\n\nOver his first eight years, especially on the environment, Reichert cast the occasional moderate vote. He was crucial on a 216-212 vote that saved the federal Land and Water Conservation Fund. He is now seemingly in lock step with the Republican leadership.\n\nThe House Republicans are even rubbing it in to the constituents of their own gerrymandered districts.\n\nRep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wash., the Republican leadership's sound bite queen, intoned on Thursday: \"Since President Obama took office, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program has grown at an unprecedented rate, with one in seven Americans receiving food stamps.\"\n\nDuh? We've been in a recession. Among the hardest hit places are those that now give Republicans their biggest majorities, low-income whites in Appalachia and the Ohio and Tennesse valleys.\n\nWhere do food stamp users reside?\n\n\"As it turns out, most of them live in Red states, Real People America,\" Tim Egan pointed out Friday in the New York Times. Of the 254 counties where food stamp use doubled in the Great Recession, 213 voted for Mitt Romney.\n\nCandidly, I've expected more out of Reichert. He represents a progressive state, one that is recovering from the Great Recession, a place where health care reform is covering more people and saving the taxpayers money.\n\nThe Republican leadership has rewarded Reichert's loyalty with ... nothing.\n\nHe is the longtime champion of a good, non-controversial, bipartisan cause -- adding 22,000 acres in eastern King County to the Alpine Lakes Wilderness Area, and protecting the Middle Fork-Snoqualmie River under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act.\n\nReichert got a Democratic-controlled House to pass this legislation in 2010. (It died in the Senate's rush to adjourn.) He has been unable to resurrect or move it in a House run by his own party.\n\nThe legislation has languished in the House Natural Resources Committee. The panel is chaired by a Washington colleague, ultra-conservative, wilderness-hating Rep. Doc Hastings. Reichert did get a subcommittee hearing in July, but no sign since of passage.\n\nA sheriff gets a certain amount of respect and deference with his position. But the lion's share he or she acquires through effort and action.\n\nDave Reichert is forfeiting respect with such votes as slashing food stamps. Reichert has jettisoned the affable, accessible presence that let him disarm MoveOn.org and other liberal critics during his early years in Congress. He was a good political negotiator -- then.\n\nNever has the Republican Party more needed sense, across-the-aisle collegiality and an ability to work out society's compromises.\n\nInstead, Dave Reichert has aligned himself with the Huns of Congress, those who would lay waste to the nation's social contract with its people.
