Bernie Sanders\u2019 presidential campaign has had so far among young Americans?\n\nEarlier this month, Salon spoke with leading Democratic Party pollster Stan Greenberg about what he learned from conducting focus groups with millennials. \u201cThey think the system\u2019s rigged,\u201d he told us.\n\nGreenberg\u2019s findings were intriguing, and they suggested that the next generation of Americans are itching to shake up an economic and political system they associate with corruption, inequality and stagnation.\n\nBut as useful as focus groups can be, they also have their limits \u2014 which is where \u201cThe Next Generation Blueprint for 2016,\u201d a new, in-depth survey from the Roosevelt Institute (which also helped produce Greenberg\u2019s focus groups) comes in.\n\nRecently, Salon spoke over the phone with Joelle Gamble, national director for the Roosevelt Institute Campus Network, about the survey and what makes young people in America tick. This interview has been edited for clarity and length.\n\nYou report a feeling among millennials that the social contract that has been in place since the New Deal is in some ways broken. What do you mean by that?\n\nThe \u201cBlueprint for 2016,\u201d our survey of 1,000 young people from 160 schools, did give us a sense that there was a desire to reimagine, for a changing America, the basic building blocks of our economic, civic and social well-being, because we felt like the rules as they are right now are just broken. A lot of folks have grown up in an environment where the job market wasn\u2019t what it was promised to be. We\u2019ve graduated or are going to graduate, if we went to college, with a lot of student loan debt. We see a lot of our family members, even ourselves, not feeling safe on their own streets.\n\nSo we feel like this contract, this promise between government and its citizens to provide the basic building blocks of our economic, civic and social well-being just wasn\u2019t fair, which is why we thought issues like education and the economy and human rights come to the top of the agenda, and why our Blueprint calls for candidates and elected officials to prioritize action in these three areas, not just during their terms, but aggressively in their approach to their first 100 days after the election. Because we believe that these are necessary in order to secure and achieve a vision that embraces the human dignity of everyone.\n\nWhat is the most important issue to millennials?\n\nIt\u2019s hard to say there\u2019s one issue, because I believe that there was an overall sense of not just one single issue, but a [desire for] larger reform of who gets to rewrite the rules, the sense that the folks who are currently in charge of making decisions that affect us are not being as effective as they can be.\n\nSixty-four percent of our survey respondents identified decreasing the influence of money in politics as a top priority for the next administration. They didn\u2019t always see it as the most likely thing to get done in the first 100 days, but they saw it as one of the most important. Eighty percent of them cared more about a fair and inclusive political process than seeing their own candidate win. So ultimately it\u2019s about how rules get made and who gets to make them.\n\nThe survey found that K-12 education was an even more important issue to millennials than student loan debt, which cuts against a common criticism of millennials \u2014 that they only really care about themselves.\n\nWe were a little bit surprised, but pleasantly surprised by this, because student debt is thought of as the biggest college student issue. But because respondents also were thinking about overall how the education system prepares people for a changing economy, their own experiences, as well as those their children will ultimately face, we ended up with a broader set of policies and issues that came to the top.\n\nUltimately, as we surveyed respondents and as we convened smaller focus groups of young folks to help cull through the results and interpret the data, we realized there were a couple of core values that were driving why young people were supporting education. So, yes, there\u2019s this economic component, which of course links directly to debt, but it\u2019s also about how people get access to society overall and how they\u2019re prepared to engage as citizens. All of these other things are encompassed in how folks viewed education. Being able to give someone a good system at the beginning is really important, not just what they\u2019re facing in college.\n\nIt seemed to me that, overall, millennials were much more interested in placing the community at the center of their politics than are, say, Baby Boomers, who tend to place more of an emphasis on individualism instead.\n\nI believe that there is a strong streak of valuing collective action within our generation, millennials and Generation Z, the generation that is emerging after them, who we also included in this survey. We looked at economics, and with some of the issues that came to the top, we realized that view of collective action and the importance of everyone being able to work together to achieve goals instead of individualism really came through. Because folks cared about reforming the tax code, but they also cared about how to build strong local economies and the ways in which the economy actually affected them where they were.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Young Americans are anxious to \"disrupt\" and upend a broken status quo, Roosevelt Institute expert tells Salon", "title": "\u201cSomething bold needs to happen\u201d: An in-depth look at millennial America", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Young Americans are anxious to \"disrupt\" and upend a broken status quo, Roosevelt Institute expert tells Salon", "title": "\u201cSomething bold needs to happen\u201d: An in-depth look at millennial America", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/02/20/something_bold_needs_to_happen_an_in_depth_look_at_millennial_america/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/02/young_bernie_sanders_supporters.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Young Americans are anxious to \"disrupt\" and upend a broken status quo, Roosevelt Institute expert tells Salon", "title": "\u201cSomething bold needs to happen\u201d: An in-depth look at millennial America", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/02/young_bernie_sanders_supporters.jpg", "creator": "@eliasisquith", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Elias Isquith", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Bernie Sanders, Blueprint for 2016, Campaign Finance Reform, Editor's Picks, generation z, Joelle Gamble, millennials, Money in politics, Roosevelt Institute, Single Payer Healthcare", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9cf5\"", "article_summary": "We were a little bit surprised, but pleasantly surprised by this, because student debt is thought of as the biggest college student issue.\nWhat is the most important issue to millennials?\nI believe that there is a strong streak of valuing collective action within our generation, millennials and Generation Z, the generation that is emerging after them, who we also included in this survey.\nIt seemed to me that, overall, millennials were much more interested in placing the community at the center of their politics than are, say, Baby Boomers, who tend to place more of an emphasis on individualism instead.\nRecently, Salon spoke over the phone with Joelle Gamble, national director for the Roosevelt Institute Campus Network, about the survey and what makes young people in America tick."}
