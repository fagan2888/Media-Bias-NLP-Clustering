Newaygo will host one conversation, while Oceana and Muskegon County will each host two, Baas said.\n\n\"Those are like town hall meetings,\" she said. \"Residents can come and talk to people and share their stories.\"\n\nIn addition to the public meetings, the Health Project will form topical focus groups for certain disease and health conditions based on the survey results in May.\n\nThe last assessment, completed in 2012, identified obesity, depression, diabetes, high blood pressure and STDs and teen pregnancy as the top-ranked issues in Muskegon County. Second-ranked issues included smoking, dental care access, the need for health insurance and preventative care, nutrition education and access to healthy foods.\n\nOceana and Newaygo counties reported similar issues but also listed other matters as concerns, including lack of prenatal care, language barriers, senior isolation and home care and Native American resource awareness.\n\nBaas said the results will help local healthcare administrators allocate their resources to improve services.\n\nMercy Health is also welcoming residents to volunteer to help conduct surveys. Baas said many patients in the community have limited or no computer and healthcare literacy and need help responding to questions. Other residents need assistance because they are vision disabled, she said.\n\n\"We want to make sure everyone's voice is being heard and not just those with high literacy levels,\" Baas said. \"It really is about the voice of the community.\"\n\nThe survey queries community members about an array of personal details, including their gender, annual household income, immunization and family medical history, if money has affected their ability to access mental health services and if they have ever experienced healthcare-related challenges and because of their race or ethnic background.\n\nThe results from the community assessment are expected by September 2015.\n\nTake the survey below at: https://www.surveymk.com/s/CHNA_English.\n\nBaas said survey respondents should be at least 18 years old and should not complete the questionnaire more than once.", "article_metadata": {"article_author": "Michelle D.
