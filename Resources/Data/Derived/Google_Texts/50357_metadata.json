Doctors and other health care providers also should expect few changes.\n\n\u201cIt will be business as normal whether a for-profit operates it or a non-profit,\u201d he said.\n\nCHS, which owns, leases or operates 206 affiliated hospitals in 29 states with 31,100 licensed beds, may be able to find internal cost savings when it takes over Metro Health, he said.\n\nIn a best-case scenario, a price war could result between CHS and the region\u2019s two big health care systems, Mercy Health and Spectrum Health, Zwarensteyn said.\n\n\n\nRELATED: Metro Health to sell 80 percent interest to Tennessee health care giant\n\nThe question of who will be paid and how much is an issue that will be governed by the Attorney General\u2019s office, which must sign off on the agreement before it can go forward, Zwarensteyn said.\n\nA certificate of need review by the Michigan Department of Community Health also will be required.\n\nZwarensteyn said the ownership and sale of a non-profit is a big question that could be resolved by the creation of a community foundation.\n\n\u201cIf a non-profit sells, technically the community owns it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe community is the one that built it and it\u2019s the people of the community who used the place.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is kind of virgin territory.\u201d\n\nWhile CHS can be expected to take over Metro Health\u2019s debt and bond payments, Zwarensteyn said the non-profit\u2019s equity and the value of its good will in the community should determine how much CHS will pay.\n\nSidney Allen, a spokesman for the Attorney General's office, issued the following statement to The Grand Rapids Press and MLive.com Friday afternoon:\n\n\"Our office reviews non-profit to for-profit transactions to ensure that the nonprofit\u2019s charitable assets are preserved for the benefit of the public. Our review of the transaction you referenced is just beginning and we expect to complete it over the next 4-6 months,\" Allen said.\n\nIn its announcement, Metro Health said CHS has pledged $100 million to $125 million in capital for investments in facilities, services, medical technology and physician recruitment in the first five years. It also has pledged to continue Metro Health's services and partnerships with University of Michigan, Orthopaedic Associates of Michigan, Pennant Health and others.\n\nMetro Health\u2019s board chairman, Doyle Hayes, and its president and CEO, Mike Faas, were not available for comment after the announcement was made.\n\nJim Harger covers business for MLive/Grand Rapids Press.
