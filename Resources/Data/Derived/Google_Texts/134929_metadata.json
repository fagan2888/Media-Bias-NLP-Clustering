The word \u201cliberal\u201d comes from the Latin word meaning freedom, and in the 19th century, liberals in this country and abroad stood for free speech, free exercise of religion, free markets, free trade \u2014 for minimal state interference in people\u2019s lives.\n\nIn the 20th century, New Dealers revised this definition by arguing that people also had a right to, as Franklin Roosevelt said in his 1941 Four Freedoms speech, freedom from fear and from want.\n\nFreedom from want meant, for Roosevelt, government provision of jobs, housing, health care and food. And so government would have to be much larger, more expensive and more intrusive than ever before.\n\nThat\u2019s what liberalism has come to mean in America, and much of the Obama Democrats\u2019 agenda are logical outgrowths \u2014 ObamaCare, the vast expansion of food stamps, assistance to underwater homeowners.\n\nBut in some respects the Obama Democrats want to go further \u2014 and complain that they\u2019re having a hard time getting there. Their form of liberalism is in danger of standing for something like the very opposite of freedom, for government coercion of those who refuse to behave the way they\u2019d like.\n\nExample one is the constitutional amendment, sponsored by 43 Democratic senators, which would cut back on the First Amendment and authorize Congress and state legislatures to restrict political speech.\n\nThe amendment is poorly drafted and leaves many questions dangerously open (who qualifies for the media exception?), perhaps because its sponsors know it has no significant chance of passage.\n\nIt also seems animated by a delusionary paranoia: Democrats profess to fear they\u2019ll be swamped by a flood of rich people\u2019s money, even though their rich supporters have raised more than the other side in recent years.\n\nYet the picture is striking. Many conservatives once wanted to change the First Amendment to prosecute flag burning, not the Founding Fathers\u2019 central concern.\n\nToday\u2019s liberals, in contrast, want to change the First Amendment to restrict political speech, which is the core value the Founders sought to protect.\n\nOr consider liberals\u2019 attitude toward free exercise of religion, made plain in their reaction to the Supreme Court\u2019s Hobby Lobby decision declaring the ObamaCare contraception mandate to violate the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.\n\nThe bipartisan RFRA was signed by President Bill Clinton in 1993. It was prompted by a Supreme Court decision upholding the penalization of Oregon Indians for using peyote, which they claimed was a religious rite.\n\nIn passing RFRA, liberals and conservatives alike responded as Americans have often done when small groups have claimed laws infringed their religious beliefs: They put a higher priority to a few individuals\u2019 free exercise of religion than they did to widely supported laws of general application.\n\nThus Congress allowed for conscientious objectors to be exempt from military service in World War II, in which more than 400,000 US service members died. Even in a national emergency, Americans were willing to accommodate religious beliefs that a large majority did not share.\n\nToday\u2019s liberals take a different view. They want to make Hobby Lobby\u2019s owners pay for what they regard as the destruction of human life. They spent much time arguing the owners are mistaken (actually, they have a plausible scientific basis for their belief).\n\nBut the point about freedom of religion isn\u2019t that everyone has to agree. On the contrary: Almost no one agreed with the Oregon Indians\u2019 beliefs about peyote.\n\nThey just thought the larger society should not use compulsion to bar them from practicing their religion. Today\u2019s liberals seem comfortable with using the force of law to prevent people from doing so.\n\nOr consider the Supreme Court decision in Harris v. Quinn, ruling that caregivers for disabled relatives paid with Medicaid funds are not state employees and thus cannot be forced into a public-employee union.\n\nToday\u2019s liberals did this in President Obama\u2019s Illinois to channel public money away from low-income caregivers and toward public-employee unions that do so much to fund and support the Democratic Party.\n\nThey seem unembarrassed by this crass political motive and indifferent to the plight of the needy.\n\nToday\u2019s liberals seem bent on pushing people around, preventing them from speaking their minds and practicing their beliefs.
