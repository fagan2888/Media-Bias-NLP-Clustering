Obama acknowledged the dangers of \u201cpresidential overreach in second terms,\u201d but he put forward an expansive, legacy-building agenda: a major fiscal deal, immigration reform and action on climate change.\n\nTwo bruising years later, he has registered progress only on addressing climate change, and a president who once boasted of a barrier-breaking liberal coalition is under fire from his own party as his Republican rivals are poised to make gains in Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections.\n\nA routine campaign stop Sunday on behalf of Gov. Dan Malloy (D) in Bridgeport, Conn., exemplified this reversal of fortune. As the president spoke, working to rally his party\u2019s base, protesters \u2014 including one sporting an \u201cObama deports parents\u201d T-shirt \u2014interrupted him at least four times.\n\n\u201cI am sympathetic to those who are concerned about immigration,\u201d the president said amid shouts from the audience. \u201cIt\u2019s the other party that\u2019s blocked it. Unfortunately, folks get frustrated, then they want to yell at everybody.\u201d\n\nObama\u2019s journey from triumphant, validated Democratic hero to a political millstone weighing on his party\u2019s chances is a tale of a second-term president quickly and repeatedly sidetracked by a series of crises \u2014 some self-inflicted \u2014 and the widely held perception that the White House has not managed them well.\n\nThe fallout has led to questions about the president\u2019s effectiveness, his resolve and his general ability to lead, at home and abroad.\n\n\u201cThis is an administration that is very good at articulating some of its plans and responses and has delivered good speeches, but translating that into action has been a problem for the past six years,\u201d said David Rothkopf, the author of \u201cNational Insecurity: American Leadership in an Age of Fear.\u201d \u201cRight now, the vast preponderance of evidence is that management is not one of the strong suits of this administration.\u201d\n\nObama\u2019s list of second-term leadership crises is a formidable one: the botched rollout of HealthCare.gov; long waits at Veterans Affairs hospitals; Edward Snowden\u2019s disclosures of the National Security Agency\u2019s secrets; a pileup of foreign children along the southern border; Islamist terrorists marauding across Syria and Iraq and beheading foreigners, including Americans; and the arrival of the Ebola virus in the United States.\n\n\u201cThese are legitimate crises in their own right that have to be dealt with by the president. That\u2019s his job,\u201d said AFL-CIO Political Director Michael Podhorzer, a White House ally who blames the GOP for blocking Obama\u2019s economic agenda. \u201cBut that has dampened his ability to speak out on other issues.\u201d\n\nAt a fundraising event in New York in September, Obama talked about \u201cdisquiet\u201d in the country despite the improving economy. The reason for that, he said, is that most people \u201cjust think government doesn\u2019t seem to be capable of working anymore.\u201d\n\nHe blamed Republicans, but it is the president and his party who may pay the heaviest price for that public perception.\n\nView Graphic Election Lab: See our current forecast for every congressional race in 2014\n\nDefining moments\n\nAbout a month after Obama was reelected, his agenda priorities were dramatically altered when 20 children and six adults were killed in a shooting at a Connecticut elementary school. The massacre upended Washington\u2019s political debate and focused it squarely on gun control. Thinking it had a strong hand to play, the White House launched an all-out push to ban assault rifles and require stricter background checks for gun buyers.\n\n\u201cEvery president finds that after setting an agenda on the campaign, the agenda is set for them by the world,\u201d said Matt Bennett, vice president of Third Way, a centrist think tank that supports stricter gun laws. \u201cThis time, the external events dictated the timing of something no one thought they would be taking up.\u201d\n\nBut even the enthusiastic embrace of the issue by the White House was unable to deliver results. The Senate rejected all of the president\u2019s gun-control proposals in April 2013, handing Obama an early defeat on an issue that had fixated much of the country.\n\nInside the West Wing, the loss, while frustrating, was not considered an event that would set a tone of failure for the second term. The president and his advisers remained convinced that they could pursue big, bipartisan deals to cement an Obama legacy.\n\nThe president set about trying to woo enough Republican senators to pass key bills with margins large enough to pressure the GOP-controlled House to follow.\n\nMost of the White House overtures quickly fell apart. Then-Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus (D-Mont.) and ranking Republican Orrin G. Hatch (Utah) began discussing a possible tax-reform proposal. But once the two sides delved into the details, the initiative \u2014 along with the broader discussion of a comprehensive fiscal deal \u2014 collapsed.\n\nRepublicans said Obama\u2019s lack of follow-through, rather than an ideological impasse, was to blame.\n\nThat spring, a group of Senate Republicans met with Obama over dinner to explore entitlement and tax-code reform. Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) considered such an overhaul a priority, but he had a small side concern: He wanted to urge the president to use his influence with Democrats to prevent a change in the Senate\u2019s filibuster rules. The change would strip the minority party \u2014 the GOP now, but maybe the Democrats next year \u2014 of its power to block or slow presidential nominations.\n\nAt the dinner, Alexander said, he handed Obama a one-page memo making his argument that this administration would not be justified in changing the rules because it had gotten as many nominees approved as previous administrations in similar circumstances.\n\nAside from a second request for the memo, Alexander said, he never heard back. He was disappointed, and he called the snub indicative of why the White House has trouble getting things done on Capitol Hill. \u201cI would have liked for someone to show me where I was wrong or show me where I was right,\u201d he said.\n\nWhite House senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer said the real problem was not disagreement about nominations but GOP intransigence on raising taxes as part of any fiscal deal, suggesting that the differences were substantial and maybe insurmountable.\n\n\u201cIf they\u2019re unwilling to move off their core principle, then they are unwilling to compromise, and nothing can get done,\u201d he said.\n\nRep. Rosa L. DeLauro (D-Conn.) said that Republicans have deliberately let problems \u201cfester\u201d as part of a broader strategy of diminishing \u201cthe capacity of government to respond to crises.\u201d\n\nBy October 2013, Democrats believed that they had seized the upper hand on fiscal matters, as the GOP forced a 16-day government shutdown, causing furloughs for 850,000 federal workers and costing $2 billion in lost productivity. The shutdown was the most vivid evidence of the depth of antipathy toward Obama in the GOP, particularly in the House. The unwillingness to work with the president on almost any issue has spawned what is known as the \u201cHope Yes, Vote No Caucus.\u201d These are lawmakers who might be inclined to support compromise measures but vote against them for fear that voters will punish them for working with Obama.\n\n\n\nThe shutdown was a political disaster for the GOP, but hope among Democrats that they had finally broken the opposition was short-lived, as the White House quickly became consumed by the troubled rollout of the online federal health insurance exchange, which launched Oct. 1, the same day the shutdown began.\n\nEven as Obama and his aides scrambled to fix the Web site in the early days, according to people familiar with the situation, senior Health and Human Services officials did not provide them with accurate information about the depth of the system\u2019s problems.\n\nAlthough the site was mostly repaired within two months, a White House ally cited the botched rollout as a defining moment because Republicans, who had been reeling after the 2012 election loss, stopped \u201cfeeling defeated\u201d and were emboldened once again.\n\nA new strategy\n\nThe wreckage of 2013 had similar effects on the combatants: The president\u2019s approval ratings took a nose dive, and Congress\u2019s were even worse. Gallup reported that 42 percent of the public approved of Obama\u2019s performance as the new year dawned.\n\nInside the West Wing, Obama\u2019s top advisers developed a new strategy based on a memo from Pfeiffer that concluded that the president had acted too much like a prime minister, relying on lawmakers to get things done. In 2014, Obama would hold out one hand to Capitol Hill, but with the other he would more aggressively move the levers of executive power. John D. Podesta, a Democratic strategist with deep Washington experience, was brought aboard as a senior counselor \u2014 a signal that Obama\u2019s insular inner circle meant business.\n\nPodesta\u2019s influence was felt early on when the White House introduced an ambitious regulation to cut greenhouse gas emissions from existing utilities \u2014 the most far-reaching climate rule ever undertaken by the federal government, which does not need congressional approval.\n\nBut whatever momentum the White House hoped to gain from that initiative was cut short as the news cycle was consumed by a crisis along the southwestern border, where tens of thousands of foreign children were crossing illegally. The situation was even more disruptive to Obama\u2019s agenda than the health-care embarrassment; it helped drive the final stake through the heart of his 18-month push for an overhaul of the immigration system.\n\nAfter Obama was reelected, conventional wisdom in Washington held that the first broad immigration reform bill in three decades was within reach as Republicans sought to repair their image with the fast-growing Hispanic voting bloc. Even after House Republicans blocked a bipartisan Senate immigration bill in the fall of 2013, the White House held out hope that House leaders would relent after the 2014 primary season, when they would be safe from challenges from the right.\n\nBut the combination of the border crisis and the defeat of House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) in the primary in June by a tea party challenger running on a staunch anti-immigration platform doomed the chances for a bill.\n\nAt the end of June, Obama stood in the White House Rose Garden and announced that he would not wait for Congress and would act on his own to reform immigration laws. That threat sparked anxiety among vulnerable Democrats who persuaded the president in September to back off and wait until after the midterm elections to act.\n\nImmigration advocates, already angry at Republicans, turned their ire on the White House.\n\n\u201cWith regard to immigration, I just think the conviction isn\u2019t there,\u201d said Kevin Appleby, director of migration policy for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. \u201cEvery decision that has been made has been based on political calculation. You live by the political sword, you die by it.\u201d\n\nThe executive-action delay was designed to protect Democratic incumbents in conservative states, but it put Sen. Mark Udall (D-Colo.) on the defensive with a key constituency in his state, whose population is 21 percent Hispanic.\n\nUdall said in an interview that Latino voters \u201csaw me express my disappointment with the president\u2019s decision to delay. I\u2019ve made it very clear that after I\u2019m reelected, I\u2019m going to be at the doorstep of the White House pushing them to use the executive authority they have to keep families together.\u201d\n\nInternational crises\n\nThe White House attempted to regain its footing over the summer by sending the president on the road to connect with ordinary Americans, comparing Obama\u2019s jaunts to a bear breaking free of his handlers.\n\nThe goal was to talk about pocketbook issues \u2014 the minimum wage, equal pay for women \u2014 and cast Washington as consumed by manufactured political controversies. But the tour took on a discordant note when set against a series of international crises: the standoff with Russia\u2019s Vladi\u00admir Putin in eastern Ukraine, the outbreak of Ebola in West Africa and the rise of the Islamic State militant group, whose gruesome executions of two Americans helped persuade Obama to authorize a new U.S. military campaign in Iraq and Syria.\n\nThat decision was a major setback for a president who had staked his foreign policy legacy on ending U.S. wars in the Middle East. In late September at the United Nations, Obama noted a\u201cpervasive sense of unease\u201d across the world.\n\nTo his critics, the Syria crisis highlighted Obama\u2019s greatest foreign policy weakness: a determination to engage with the world in the opposite fashion from predecessor George W. Bush at almost any cost.\n\nWhere Bush rushed into war in Iraq, Obama has been determined to limit U.S. military engagement and rely on diplomatic coalition-building. The president reversed himself in the fall of 2013 on plans to launch airstrikes against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, leading even some of his heavyweight former Cabinet members \u2014 Hillary Rodham Clinton, Robert M. Gates and Leon Panetta \u2014 to question his approach.\n\n\u201cBush is a leader who didn\u2019t like to think,\u201d said Ian Bremmer, president of the Eurasia Group, a global political risk-management firm. \u201cObama is a thinker who doesn\u2019t like to lead.\u201d\n\nAt home, as the president has made his case to voters this fall on behalf of fellow Democrats, he has returned time and again to the improving economy. The United States boasts its lowest national unemployment rate in six years, the stock market is at record highs, and about 10 million people have enrolled in health coverage under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBut the argument has largely fallen flat.\n\nJohn Puckett, co-owner of Punch Pizza, a Minneapolis chain that raised wages above the federal minimum, is stumped about why. Puckett met with Obama\u2019s speechwriters ahead of the president\u2019s State of the Union address in January, and Obama gave the pizzeria a shout-out while announcing plans to increase wages for federal contractors to start what the president called \u201ca year of action.\u201d\n\nPuckett said that business is humming and that Minnesota\u2019s economy continues to grow.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost like you\u2019re in a different world when you see the bad polls about how people feel about the future,\u201d he said. \u201cYou do look at the national stuff and scratch your head.\u201d\n\nZachary A.
