She said in a morning panel that to make progress, men needed to be in the room as well.\n\nO\u2019Brien agreed that sometimes the fight isn\u2019t about the competition \u2014 whether it be women or men \u2014 but about the system as a whole.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a story of human beings,\u201d she told the Review-Journal. \u201cNot just women.\u201d\n\nShe has highlighted the plights of several demographics facing struggles in her documentaries \u201cLatino in America,\u201d \u201cBlack in America\u201d and the soon-to-be-released story of veterans, \u201cThe War Comes Home.\u201d\n\nOne documentary she produced is focused specifically on women, though. Lights lowered during the session and part of \u201cBeyond Bravery\u201d played, a tribute to female emergency personnel in New York City\u2019s Sept. 11 attacks, who were scarcely publicized initially.\n\nMany women were visibly affected by the video, but attendee Tammi Booth was touched in a way different from most in the room. Booth was a New York City firefighter \u2014 the first in her crew \u2014 until shortly before the towers were hit.\n\nHalf of her group died in the chaotic moments of rescue before the buildings collapsed. Now, she keeps that in mind and tries to inspire younger women to go after their career goals, even if they receive gender-based pushback.\n\nO\u2019Brien ramped back up the energy of the session after the somber moments and left the stage to a standing ovation. She later told the Review-Journal that although she doesn\u2019t think the struggle is women\u2019s only, she does think gatherings like this one are important.\n\nWomen can network more freely without feeling the sometimes-judgmental gaze of men, she said, which is crucial to becoming a professional and a leader.\n\nO\u2019Brien said there are also things a woman simply won\u2019t talk about in the presence of men. Like the young women in Q&A sessions who ask her for advice on what they should wear for their first day anchoring a news segment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not something they get a memo about,\u201d she said.\n\nIssues like that \u2014 which aren\u2019t life-or-death, but can greatly affect a career \u2014 are why she thinks the solidarity felt during this conference is so important.\n\nSoledad\u2019s advice for women in leadership positions is to be both strategic and flexible. It\u2019s not an easy balance, but it\u2019s a combination that has helped her be successful.\n\n\u201cGenuine feminism is having options,\u201d she said.\n\nThe energy she stirred up continued toward the end of the conference. Breakout session speakers kept their crowds laughing and cheering.\n\nThe conference was also successful from MGM Resorts Foundation\u2019s perspective. Plans for next year will begin almost immediately, with a new goal of 1,000 registrants. The proceeds of this year\u2019s conference will go to a nonprofit organization that focuses on the development of women.\n\nThat announcement will be made in March. Last year, $20,000 was donated to Safe Nest.\n\nContact reporter Annalise Little at alittle@reviewjournal.com or 702-383-0391.
