And according to a new study commissioned by the group, reducing the cost of those policies could deliver immediate relief to property tax payers.\n\nSteve Dale is the head of the organization, and he says the group isn\u2019t making any formal recommendations yet. But the study looks to be setting the table for cost-cutting reform proposals down the road.\n\n\u201cThe current cost of health care for public school employees is contributing to this situation that we\u2019ve had over the past few years of rapidly rising property taxes, and also the fact that the cost situation is limiting the ability of schools to invest in the education of our students,\u201d Dale says.\n\n\"The current cost of health care for public school employees is contributing to this situation that we've had over the past few years of rapidly rising property taxes.\" - Steve Dale, Vermont School Boards Association\n\nThe study was performed by Scott Mackey, an economist and a managing partner at the Montpelier lobbying firm, KSE Partners. It found that Vermont will spend about $233 million on teacher health plans in 2015 \u2013 the vast majority of which will be financed by taxpayer-funded school budgets.\n\nThe teacher plans are among the best health insurance plans available \u2013 annual costs for family plans can exceed $22,000. So Mackey took a look at what would happen if the teacher plan was replaced with one of the \u201cgold\u201d plans sold on Vermont Health Connect, the online insurance marketplace.\n\n\u201cIn terms of, for this study, looking at something from a fairness perspective that would put school employees still at sort of the generous end of what Vermonters are getting today \u2026 there would be about a $39 million savings for taxpayers, which would translate into about 4 cents on the statewide property tax rate,\u201d says Mackey, who formerly chaired the board at Harwood Union High School. Mackey has been a public critic of the state\u2019s education financing law, known as Act 68.\n\nDale calls the study food for thought for school boards and for lawmakers, many of whom say they\u2019re under increased pressure from disaffected property taxpayers who have seen rates spike in recent years. And it serves as a sort of opening salvo in a looming debate over education spending in Montpelier, and how to curb it.\n\n\u201cThis is an issue that is the nexus between two of the most high profile political issues in Vermont at the moment, one being health care reform and the other being property taxes,\u201d Dale says. \u201cSo we felt that it\u2019s a very timely issue to be taking a deep look at.\u201d\n\nJoel Cook, executive director of the Vermont-NEA, says teachers are leading the push for reform, in both education and health care. But Cook says it makes far more sense to figure out how to improve health care for all Vermonters, rather than rolling back benefits for a choice few.\n\n\"For people to come in and suggest that everybody go down to 80 percent, rather than for us to come as close as what state employees have, and many school employees have, is foolish in the extreme frankly.\" - Joel Cook, Vermont NEA\n\n\u201cFor people to come in and suggest that everybody go down to 80 percent, rather than for us to come as close as what state employees have, and many school employees have, is foolish in the extreme frankly,\u201d Cook says.\n\nCook says educators are committed to working with lawmakers to improve the system. But he says the spending trajectory in public education isn\u2019t as grim as some critics have suggested. As a percentage of total income in the state, according to Cook, spending on public education has been flat for the last 20 years.\n\n\u201cWhat I don\u2019t agree with is that the spending track for public education is what some people refer to as unsustainable,\u201d Cook says.\n\nThe study also looks at what might happen if Vermont adopts the single-payer health care plan being pushed by Gov. Peter Shumlin. The governor\u2019s plan would replace private, employer-sponsored health premiums with a system of public financing.\n\nShumlin hasn\u2019t said yet how he\u2019d fund single payer, but he\u2019s said the program would likely rely on a payroll tax. If employers had to pay a 13 percent payroll tax under the new system, then health-insurance related costs for schools would shrink by $83 million, according to Mackey.\n\nBut while the NEA wants to see much of those savings returned to teachers in the form of higher base pay \u2013 in part as compensate for the lower-quality plan they\u2019d likely receive in a single-payer system \u2013 Dale says lawmakers should preserve districts\u2019 ability to use the money instead to reduce local property taxes.\n\nDale says that single payer or no, change is coming to the health care plans provided by public schools. That\u2019s in part due to a clause in the federal Affordable Care Act that will, beginning in 2018, impose a 40 percent excise tax on so-called \u201cCadillac plans.\u201d Dale says plans offered by most schools now will meet the Cadillac criteria, and that the resulting tax penalties would render them cost prohibitive.\n\n\u201cI think the point is that we as a society are changing to a whole different approach to health care, and we need to be open to what that change is going to look like in the world of education, and to manage it in a way that\u2019s fair to all involved,\u201d Dale says.\n\nRising property tax rates have emerged as a top issue in races for House and Senate this year, and top Democratic lawmakers called a press conference earlier this month to promise meaningful spending and financing reforms next year, if voters return them to office. Republicans called the event an election-season ploy.\n\nThe School Boards Association will hold its annual conference later this week, where Dale says the study will serve a springboard for discussion among board members from across the state.", "article_metadata": {"category": "VPR News", "description": "The Vermont School Boards Association says it\u2019s time to take a closer look at the top-shelf health insurance plans being enjoyed by the state\u2019s public", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "VPR News", "og": {"url": "http://digital.vpr.net/post/school-boards-scrutinize-teacher-health-plans", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/vpr/files/201411/vpr-logo.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The Vermont School Boards Association says it\u2019s time to take a closer look at the top-shelf health insurance plans being enjoyed by the state\u2019s public", "title": "School Boards Scrutinize Teacher Health Plans"}, "story_id": 359415305, "twitter": {"site": "@vprnet", "card": "summary", "creator": "@vprnet"}, "author": "Peter Hirschfeld", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "School Boards Scrutinize Teacher Health Plans"}, "nid": 31712, "datePublished": "2014-10-27", "keywords": "Education, Government & Politics, VPR News", "wordCount": 988, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe285b\"", "article_summary": "The Vermont School Boards Association says it\u2019s time to take a closer look at the top-shelf health insurance plans being enjoyed by the state\u2019s public school teachers.\nThe teacher plans are among the best health insurance plans available \u2013 annual costs for family plans can exceed $22,000.\n- Steve Dale, Vermont School Boards AssociationThe study was performed by Scott Mackey, an economist and a managing partner at the Montpelier lobbying firm, KSE Partners.\nIt found that Vermont will spend about $233 million on teacher health plans in 2015 \u2013 the vast majority of which will be financed by taxpayer-funded school budgets.\nDale says that single payer or no, change is coming to the health care plans provided by public schools."}
