Making the licensing process too wieldy or expensive or imposing too many regulations won\u2019t work. People will just continue to ignore the rules and rent out their primary residences through online sites like Airbnb and VRBO.\n\nUnder Denver\u2019s zoning laws, renting your room or house for fewer than 30 days is illegal. But that hasn\u2019t stopped many people from doing just that.\n\nCities around the world are waking up to the short-term rental phenomenon, and tax collectors are trying to find a way to get their share.\n\nIn just a few months of collecting taxes for Airbnb rentals in Portland, Ore., and San Francisco, the two cities generated about $5 million, according to The Washington Post.\n\nDenver, thankfully, isn\u2019t thinking of using Portland\u2019s model, where hosts not only must apply for permits but also allow health and safety inspections of their residences. An analysis found that of the more than 2,000 online rentals in Portland, only 93 \u2014 or 4.7 percent \u2014 had a permit to operate legally, according to the Willamette Week.\n\nWe agree with Amie Mayhew, president of the Colorado Hotel and Lodging Association, who says Denver\u2019s system should be \u201csimplistic and streamlined.\u201d\n\nThe city\u2019s licensing process should be inexpensive and easy to navigate. And it should be simple for the businesses to remit the 10.75 percent lodger\u2019s tax as well as other sales taxes.\n\nZoning would have to be changed to allow short-term rentals. City officials say only primary residences should be rented out \u2014 defining that as the address on a person\u2019s driver\u2019s license. This will prevent people from buying homes specifically for short-term rental purposes.\n\nUnlike Portland, Denver shouldn\u2019t do exhaustive inspections. That would bog down licensing and be a drag on city coffers. One idea is to have businesses check off boxes indicating they have the proper protections in place.\n\nSome worry short-term rentals could invite more noise and unruliness to their neighborhoods. However, the city has laws on the books to deal with those problems already, which are hardly confined to visitors.\n\nBesides, short-term rentals are already here. Trying to run them out would be extremely short-sighted.\n\nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Denver should legalize the Airbnb model", "title": "Denver should legalize the Airbnb model", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/02/27/denver-should-legalize-the-airbnb-model/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150227__20150228_Z00_OP01E_AIRBNBp1.jpg", "height": 404}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150227__20150228_Z00_OP01E_AIRBNBp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-27T16:26:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T23:14:02+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Denver is smart to consider building a framework to legalize and tax short-term rentals, because, let\u2019s face it, hundreds of those rentals already exist.\nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.\nSome worry short-term rentals could invite more noise and unruliness to their neighborhoods.\nBesides, short-term rentals are already here.\nPeople will just continue to ignore the rules and rent out their primary residences through online sites like Airbnb and VRBO."}
