Traditional wholesalers and florists can\u2019t forecast what consumers will buy. \u201cSo they have to have 50 different options, so that they can sell 25. Those 25 have to subsidize the 25 that were thrown out. That didn\u2019t make sense to me,\u201d she said. \u201cTo eliminate the waste, we eliminated the option.\u201d\n\nNational shipping, which started last spring, makes up 30 percent of Farmgirl Flowers\u2019 business, and Ms. Stembel has plans for an outpost on the East Coast in the next year or two. But when she began her business in 2010, many in the industry were skeptical.\n\n\u201cAt the time I thought this was just another example of San Francisco being seven square miles surrounded by reality,\u201d Kasey Cronquist, chief executive of the California Cut Flower Commission, a state agency that promotes local farmers and flowers grown in the state. Changing the way flowers are sold in the country is \u201ca bit like turning the Titanic,\u201d Mr. Cronquist said.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe large flower companies can offer dozens of bouquet and gift options at a wide range of prices. \u201cIf you compare her to a company like FTD or Teleflora or 1-800-Flowers, she\u2019s not so big, but she\u2019s a force to be reckoned with. She is quickly showing those companies that there is a consumer audience that loves what she does,\u201d he said.\n\nOthers in the industry remain skeptical. Every few years a company something like Farmgirl Flowers emerges, \u201cand they tend to have success in their own market in their own niche,\u201d said Thomas L. Prince, the president of Prince & Prince, a flower industry research firm. But when they try to expand nationally, they face logistical challenges and have trouble keeping prices affordable, he said, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s a niche concept that works in California because the growers are there.\u201d\n\nMs. Stembel used personal savings to start her company and has been unable to interest outside investors in helping her expand. Investor-funded flower start-ups include BloomThat, BloomNation and the Bouqs. Ms. Stembel says her business model is giving investors pause. Those she has spoken with want her to hire contract employees and delivery workers rather than full-time employees to save on employee benefits, she said. But that\u2019s not the way she\u2019s willing to do business. All 46 of her staff members are employees, including delivery staff, and they all receive full medical insurance paid for by Farmgirl Flowers, a departure from many start-up models.\n\nInvestors also want her to work with overseas flower farmers for cheaper rates, a nonstarter for Ms. Stembel. \u201cI won\u2019t use imports. I won\u2019t offer an import line. I won\u2019t test it out and see if people care,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not aligned with what the mission for our company is. Nor do I think it\u2019s the right thing to do business-wise.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSpeak to any American flower farmer for long enough and the 1991 Andean Trade Preference Act will most likely come up. The goal was to move South American countries away from illegal drug-trafficking and toward legal industries like flower farming. But once tariffs were removed, flower farmers in the United States could not compete with the prices of South American-grown flowers.\n\nThe trade deal forced as many as half of the cut-flower farmers in the United States out of business, according to the commission. In California alone, there were over 500 farmers in the early 1990s. Today just over 200 remain.\n\nPhoto\n\nSouth American flower farmers \u201chave the advantage of labor, the advantage of their weather conditions and sunlight, so they have some natural things and some cultural things going for them,\u201d Mr. Cronquist said. \u201cThey also have the support of our government.\u201d\n\nFor years human rights groups have raised concerns about child labor, human rights violations, and extensive exposure to pesticides and other chemicals on South American flower farms. The response has been an increase in flower certifications such as Fair Trade and Veriflora, an agriculture sustainability and worker protection certification.\n\nStill, imported flowers have benefits. \u201cThere is just not enough domestic production to meet demand. That is why we have such a global market,\u201d Peter J. Moran, the chief executive of the Society of American Florists, said in an email. \u201cThere is also the seasonality issue where some flowers are not available all year long in some production regions in the country. That is why florists rely on both domestic and globally sourced products.\u201d\n\nAnd the price is right, Mr. Prince said. The reason 80 percent of flowers are imported is that \u201cwholesalers buy them and retailers want them, and they are less expensive.\u201d (Many types of imported flowers are able to stay fresh in dedicated temperature-regulated jets.)\n\nThe shift to imports has affected the way the remaining American flower farmers operate. \u201cOnce upon a time, we were the largest carnation grower in the U.S.,\u201d said Robert Kitayama, president of the Kitayama Brothers flower farm in Watsonville, Calif., about 90 miles south of San Francisco. His family\u2019s farm, which has been in operation since 1948, also used to be one of the country\u2019s largest rose growers, he said. When cheaper imports started entering the market, the farm switched to growing lilies, snapdragons and other flowers that are harder to ship.\n\nMs. Stembel is a fan of the Kitayama Brothers flowers, particularly the snapdragons, and Farmgirl Flowers has become a significant customer, Mr. Kitayama said.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s helping smaller farmers believe there is a future in growing flowers,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20160109123947, "twitter": {"description": "The locavore movement urges buying food produced in one\u2019s immediate region.
