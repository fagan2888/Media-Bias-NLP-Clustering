Christopher Conlin, deputy director of the California Department of Parks and Recreation and essentially the state\u0092s \u0094general\u0094 in the war against the weeds, says work began in early March to spray and harvest the hyacinth, along with sponge plant, and egeria densa. Watch a video of the meeting here. Our story continues below the video window. California war on hyacinth update by Chris Conlin to Delta Protection Commission in Rio Vista, March 19, 2015 from Gene Beley on Vimeo. \u0093We\u0092ve already covered 89 surface acres of water hyacinth, pulling out 36,000 cubic yards, and treated 300 acres for egeria densa,\u0094 he told a March 19 meeting of the Delta Protection Commission in Rio Vista. And he says the days of half-hearted measures against the invasive weeds are over. \u0093We are attacking it in a more aggressive manner this year,\u0094 Mr. Conlin said. \u0093We have a requirement to control the invasive species. It is a control problem \u0097 not an eradication problem.\u0094 Why? Because, he said, these kinds of invasive species cannot be eradicated. \u0093They are always going to be there. You\u0092re not going to get rid of the seeds. Even if you emptied the Delta and sprayed, you would probably not get rid of it.\u0094 He also said that control efforts are limited because spraying is limited from March to November. But due to climate change, he\u0092s trying to get more flexibility in the laws to do a better job, he said. \u0093We think some of these envelopes can be pressed if we have good scientific data that shows we can do it in a safe manner and not damage the Delta.\u0094 Mr. Conlin said China has been spending $1 billion a year on their hyacinth problem in a similar area. \u0093The scary thing about that is you can throw as much money as you want into it but it stays. We try to do the best we can to allow people to do what they want to do in the Delta. The way the legislation is written it directs us to go in and do the control but we are not required to cover every square inch or every area. We are required to go in and see if it is interfering with navigation, recreation, or critical infrastructure in the Delta. Then we make a call to go in and balance all those priorities. Perhaps a comparison between China and California doesn\u0092t paint the correct picture. Assemblyman Jim Frazier, D-Oakley, said the state of Florida is spending upwards of $58 million to fight the hyacinth and California is spending less than $10 million now. \u0093We don\u0092t have limitless resources,\u0094 Mr. Conlin noted. \u0093No one wants us to go in heavy handed and kill all the critical species. The Delta is a unique environment.\u0094 Also, he said, his department\u0092s budget has to deal with all of California, not just the Delta. Mr. Conlin said they would be using 2,4-D herbicide as one of their heavy tools on the hyacinth \u0097 but are limited to using it during about two months in the summer. This prompted Barbara Daly, a Clarksburg resident and member of North Delta Community Area Residents for Environmental Stability (also known as North Delta CARES), to ask if that chemical doesn\u0092t contain some of the ingredients of Agent Orange that has a long, lingering shadow of suspected cancer deaths and birth defects. Mr. Conlin and Edward Hard, program manager for the Aquatic Evasive Species in California, denied this claim. That might surprise organizations such as the American Cancer Society. It says that the controversial Agent Orange, sprayed over portions of the South Vietnamese countryside during the Vietnam War, \u0093used different mixes of herbicides, \u0093but most were mixtures of 2 chemicals that were phenoxy herbicides: 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) [and] 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T).\u0094 Mr. Conlin responds, via email: \"I am not a chemist, but my understanding is that 2, 4-D does not 'contain some of the ingredients of Agent Orange.' It is true that 2, 4-D was one of the herbicides used in the chemical cocktail that composed Agent Orange. However, 2, 4-D was not found to be the reactive component that caused exposure issues.\" Mrs. Daly told the audience and commission her concerns are about the Delta water quality since it supplies so much drinking water for Californians. On March 20, one day after the Delta Protection Commission meeting, the group Beyond Pesticides, which describes itself as a \u0093nonprofit organization headquartered in Washington, D.C., which works with allies in protecting public health and the environment to lead the transition to a world free of toxic pesticides,\u0094 asked the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Department of Agriculture to stop the use of the country\u0092s most popular herbicide, glyphosate, in the wake of a finding that it causes cancer in humans. The International Agency for Research on Cancer concluded that there is sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity based on laboratory studies. Glyphosate is included in the herbicide brand \u0093Roundup.\u0094 If this is banned, Mr. Conlin and his staff may have an even bigger headache and challenge using such chemicals to fight the war on hyacinth in the Delta. Mr. Conlin said AB 763, a law passed in 2013 dealing with control and eradication of invasive water weeds like the hyacinth, gives him and his staff the ability to better coordinate everything with federal and state partners. He said there was a history of problems in the past in trying to get the permit early enough to spray the Delta or get a green light on spraying more than just hyacinth. \u0093Because of AB 763, we\u0092ve been able to get in short order two additional plants treated this year and we are trying to get funding for additional plants,\u0094 he said. Other troublesome plants include egeria densa, sponge plant, and curly leaf pondweed. \u0093You\u0092re never going to wind up with a clean Delta,\u0094 said Mr. Conlin. \u0093All these species thrive in this area, particularly now in this drought. These species came from Amazon type environments and thrive in it.\u0094 He added that the lack of more freezing temperatures this year also is a big change because that tended to kill a lot of the floating hyacinth and sunk it to the bottom until hot days in summer when it would again bloom. Why so much more treatment of egeria densa than hyacinth? \u0093It\u0092s pure physics,\u0094 Mr. Conlin explained. \u0093When you treat the water hyacinth, you can treat only what\u0092s floating on the water. You have to be very careful about not spraying things like the elderberry bushes on shore. On the other hand, when you look at egeria densa, you are treating the water \u0097 not the plant. You\u0092re putting the chemical into the water. Concentration will start to kill off the egeria densa. \u0093What\u0092s different this year is we are doing a truly integrated strategy. Instead of doing a senior attack mode with herbicide, we have partnered with our federal, state and local agencies to hit this from several directions. There\u0092s an area wide study that brings together the USDA, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), NASA, and Fish and Wildlife to work on a long-range plan instead of a one-year hit list,\u0094 he said. \u0093That opened up a whole bunch of different venues like chemical treatment. Until someone can figure out a better way, this is the best control method. By chemically treating these weeds, you stop or control their growth and from them increasing.\u0094 Mechanical harvesting \u0093Last year we did our first mechanical harvesting, Mr. Conlin said. \u0093We\u0092re still working out the rough edges on it but it is going. We\u0092re also doing some removal of the hyacinth.\u0094 He explained the difference with mechanical harvesting is that boats go out and cut the hyacinth and suck it into the vessels until it can be discarded elsewhere. The removal is when it\u0092s put it into dump trucks. One can move around in the Delta where the other is more static unless the weeds come to it and then it lifts the invasive weed out of the water. What about bug that would eat hyacinth? \u0093This year the United States Department of Agriculture will do about 25 tests with some biologicals to see if they work,\u0094 said Mr. Conlin. \u0093They tried this years ago but it was not during a drought period. The problem was when the freeze came it killed all the bugs. They think now we might have a better effect. NASA is into it, too \u0093NASA is using some high tech imaging tools to get a better read of where the plants are and what effect we\u0092re having on them,\u0094 said Mr. Conlin. Delta Protection Commission member Don Nottoli asked if the bugs migrate elsewhere and Mr. Conlin replied, \u0093They are plant specific.\u0094 \u0093These are the insects that feast on water hyacinth in its native Amazon. They only eat the hyacinth. But the reason we\u0092re starting with just 25 sites is to make absolutely sure there are no other effects,\u0094 said Mr. Conlin. \u0093Any introduction of any biological can never be taken lightly.\u0094 Delta farmers speak out \u0093Ten years ago we didn\u0092t have the hyacinth problem,\u0094 said Mike Scriven, a member of the DPC and owner of a large farm in the Delta. \u0093Somebody was asleep at the switch. Now the boaters, marinas and farmers are all behind the eight ball.\u0094 Mr. Conlin disagreed and told Mr. Scriven to look at the NASA images that tell a different story. \u0093I witnessed it,\u0094 said Mr. Scriven. \u0093You can show all the pictures you want, then talk to some of the marina operators and boaters. I have a couple thousand acres on Highway 12. I can\u0092t get water out of the pipe for the first time in 40 years.\u0094 \u0093We know the problem and this is the worst drought in the recorded history of California,\u0094 said Mr. Conlin. \u0093We had a drought in the 1970s, too,\u0094 said Mr. Scriven. Mr. Hard assisted Mr. Conlin by showing on his PowerPoint screen the status of hyacinth in 1989, 1996, 2005, 2010, and 2013, saying that proved that the current drought has had the biggest impact. Mr. Conlin said an example of a huge step forward through the cooperative efforts between various governmental agencies is that Whiskey Slough Marina has been able to install a boom at the head of the slough. It reportedly does not interfere with navigation and has been approved by law enforcement agencies that patrol the Delta. State Sen. Cathleen Galgiani, D-Stockton, has been helping to increase financial resources for the weed war. There are new funds for an additional $4 million in the Governor\u0092s budget that will give Mr. Conlin\u0092s department the ability to add four more boat crews and three scientists to analyze everything and develop better ways to fight the problem on a long-term basis, he said. Helping in the trenches Mr. Conlin said there are things people can do like towing the weeds out themselves. \u0093Many people thought they couldn\u0092t touch the plants, but that\u0092s not the case,\u0094 he said. \u0093Pulling them out helps us in the long term.\u0094 However, he said they can\u0092t get in around people\u0092s piers and spray. \u0093There are liability issues,\u0094 he said. \u0093I don\u0092t think anyone wants us around their boats and valuables if we end up damaging something. We\u0092re the heavy tool in the kit.\u0094 He commended the Port of Stockton that has hired their own harvesters and said Discovery Bay created little community compacts to take care of their evasive weeds. \u0093What people cannot do,\u0094 he stressed, \u0093is chemically treat this on their own. We do water sampling. If we reach higher than what we are allowed, it shuts us down.\u0094 Mr. Conlin said the state is only allowed to treat 5,000 acres of egeria densa and other subsurface plants, plus 3,500 acres of water hyacinth under current regulations. \u0093Because of the way hyacinth moves, it\u0092s really hard to calculate how much is getting hit by us. We\u0092re not as concerned about the upper limit yet. However, that is the reason for the scientific study. We\u0092d like to open up some of those limitations for review.\u0094 Skip Thompson, chairman of the Delta Protection Commission and a Solano County supervisor, said that all new ideas to get rid of hyacinth are welcome. \u0093Saving the Delta should be a priority. I don\u0092t want to discourage anyone from coming up with any good idea.\u0094\n\nComments on this story\n\nMary McAllister 3/24/15 4:31 PM\n\nThis is a good article. It tells the story, while also representing the viewpoints of those who are engaged in the eradication project, those who are concerned about the herbicides being used, and those who are inconvenienced by the hyacinth.\n\nTo those who are concerned about the herbicides being used, you should be. Although 2,4-D is not Agent Orange, they are both organochlorines. That means they accumulate in the fatty tissues of those who ingest it, in this case probably fish and then the animals and humans who eat those fish. This process of accumulating toxic chemicals is called bioaccumulation.\n\nOrganochlorines are also very persistent. DDT is an organochlorine. It was banned in the US in 1973, but it is still found in lake and stream sediments and in blood and other tissues of animals, including humans. Although the toxicity of the thousands of organochlorines varies, 2,4-D is classified as a \u0093possible human carcinogen\u0094 by the International Agency for Research on Cancer of the World Health Organization, United Nations.\n\nThe story implies, but is not explicit about the cause of this \u0093invasion.\u0094 The fact is this plant is spreading rapidly because of climate change. Both the water and the climate are warmer and are therefore promoting the growth of vegetation that is adapted to a warmer climate. There\u0092s little point in repeatedly poisoning it unless the underlying causes of climate change are addressed. All the money wasted on these futile eradication efforts would be better spent addressing the causes of climate change. We are damaging the environment further by poisoning it (and ourselves).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "California, Central Valley, business, San Joaquin Valley, Great Central Valley, news, urban sprawl, rural, real estate, housing, farming, dairy, agribusiness, cotton, oil, gasoline, ethanol, biodiesel, alternative fuels, prices, Kern, Tulare, Kings, Fresno, Madera, Merced, Mariposa, Stanislaus, San Joaquin, Stockton, Modesto, Merced, Visalia, Portervile, Bakersfield, Schwarzenegger", "distribution": "global", "description": "Central Valley Business Times.
