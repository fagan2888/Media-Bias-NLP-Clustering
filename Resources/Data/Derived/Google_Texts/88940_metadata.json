He shared his insights with The Daily Signal about the fight for religious freedom around the globe and here at home.\n\n\u201cIt is in light of the resurrection and God\u2019s sovereignty that we have freedoms, and in light of that the government doesn\u2019t tell you what to believe,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason the First Amendment is the First Amendment. It starts there because other freedoms come from that.\u201d\n\n>>> Read More: How a Pastor Reacted to Indiana\u2019s Religious Freedom Law\n\nJohnson, who has just returned from a trip to India says what he experienced in the South Asian country reminded him of the importance of religious freedom throughout the world.\n\n\u201cI was only there a few weeks, but while I was there churches were being torn down, government was occupying churches, and some newer churches that were being built up were torn down,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nIn December, religious freedom in India was called into question after a Bharatiya Janata Party member of parliament declared on Christmas Day he would hold a Hindu conversion ceremony, where Christians and Muslims would be publicly pressured to abandon their faith.\n\n>>> Commentary: Indiana Protects Religious Liberty. Why That\u2019s Good Policy.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, concerns about the state of religious freedom in India are often only addressed when it is politically expedient to do so,\u201d says The Heritage Foundation\u2019s Olivia Enos.\n\nForced or manipulated religious conversions constitute an infringement of religious liberty. However, adopting a national anti-conversion law would likely be counterproductive. Muslims and Christians have protested against anti-conversion laws that have been adopted by a handful of Indian states, alleging that these laws are often misused to intimidate religious minorities and justify mob violence.\n\nJohnson also noted that \u201cThe first western missionaries went to India, and many of them were martyred,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cBut for the last 100 years, there\u2019s been a balance in India\u2014they have non-conversion laws, so a Muslim can\u2019t convert to Hindu, a Hindu can\u2019t convert to a Christian. That\u2019s they way India has gotten along with relatively peaceful harmony [during that time].\u201d\n\nThe hope for the United States when it comes to religious freedom lies in our rights as citizens.\n\n\u201cIndia has never had grounded religious freedom in their country\u2019s DNA,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThere\u2019s always been these toleration and laws against conversion whereas in the United States it\u2019s almost like our freedom of religion flows out of the freedom to convert people and that\u2019s where freedom is really seen.\u201d\n\nIndia\u2019s constitution also provides protection for religious minorities and the country has thrived as a multi-ethnic and multi-religious democracy since it gained independence 67 years ago. That is why the recent reports of mass \u201cre-conversion\u201d ceremonies in which Muslims and Christians are converted to Hinduism, and a series of church desecrations that occurred in New Delhi last December, were so troubling.\n\nIn an effort to reaffirm his government\u2019s commitment to protecting religious minorities, India\u2019s Prime Minister Narendra Modi gave a speech in February acknowledging the importance of guaranteeing religious freedom in India. But Modi will have to back up his statements with action to demonstrate his government is serious aboutreligious freedom for all peoples in India.\n\n*This article has been updated since its original publication.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The pastor of Immanuel Bible Church just outside Washington, D.C.,\u00a0has a new appreciation for\u00a0religious freedom in the United States after a trip overseas.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The pastor of Immanuel Bible Church just outside Washington, D.C.,\u00a0has a new appreciation for\u00a0religious freedom in the United States after a trip overseas.", "title": "A Pastor\u2019s Easter Message on Religious Freedom", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150403_Cross.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-04-06T11:09:46+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1F8Ktzk"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The pastor of Immanuel Bible Church just outside Washington, D.C.,\u00a0has a new appreciation for\u00a0religious freedom in the United States after a trip overseas.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150403_Cross.jpg"}, "title": "A Pastor\u2019s Easter Message on Religious Freedom", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "religious freedom", "published_time": "2015-04-04T03:01:25+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-06T11:09:46+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "religious freedom, india, indiana, christian, hindu, muslim"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd06d2\"", "article_summary": "He shared his insights with The Daily Signal about the fight for religious freedom around the globe and here at home.\nIn an effort to reaffirm his government\u2019s commitment to protecting religious minorities, India\u2019s Prime Minister Narendra Modi gave a speech in February acknowledging the importance of guaranteeing religious freedom in India.\nPastor Jesse Johnson of Immanuel Bible Church just outside Washington, D.C., has a new appreciation for religious freedom in the United States after a recent trip overseas.\nIt starts there because other freedoms come from that.\u201d>>> Read More: How a Pastor Reacted to Indiana\u2019s Religious Freedom LawJohnson, who has just returned from a trip to India says what he experienced in the South Asian country reminded him of the importance of religious freedom throughout the world.\n\u201cUnfortunately, concerns about the state of religious freedom in India are often only addressed when it is politically expedient to do so,\u201d says The Heritage Foundation\u2019s Olivia Enos."}
