Grateful not because he is eminently qualified to hold the post. As a trained physicist and former deputy secretary of Defense, amongst his many other qualities, he comes to the job as someone who has earned it. Naming Carter is as refreshing as if a career Foreign Service officer were named to be Secretary of State.\n\nAnother plus is that he\u2019s been \u2018round the barn a few times, which means every investigative agency within the American national security orbit has looked him over more than once, and no doubt, have even spoken to his proctologist, before clearing him at the highest levels.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSo, if we should be grateful for Carter\u2019s presence, but not because he is clearable and qualified for the post\u2014somewhat unusual in an administration not widely admired for this reason\u2014then why should we be appreciative, perhaps indebted to the man?\n\nLet us count the reasons.\n\nFirst, he is willing to take the job. That might be a surprising statement to some, but when one considers that he\u2019d be number four in a succession of highly-respected players (mostly), after Robert Gates and Leon Panetta, not to mention Chuck Hagel Chuck HagelHagel says NATO deployment could spark a new Cold War with Russia Overnight Defense: House panel unveils 5B defense spending bill Hagel to next president: We need to sit down with Putin MORE, he must believe he has the key to this president\u2019s defense policy vault that others were not able to unlock. Let\u2019s couple to that notion two of his predecessors have not been terribly complimentary about their former boss\u2019s foreign policy/national defense acumen. And notice, we haven\u2019t mentioned a few very well qualified generals who also learned what the bottom of a bus looks like.\n\nTwo. One would have to conclude that Carter is a humble man, though if true, that is a rare quality, indeed, within the I-495 Beltway. Humble? If it is true that he was passed over when Senator Hagel was chosen, we might ask ourselves about the motivation of an administration to name an unloved Republican\u2014neither well qualified by dint of management nor well-schooled in national defense arcana\u2014when others better suited\u2014like Carter?\u2014were around. More recently, the name of Michele Flournoy was mentioned with more verve and interest than Carter\u2019s when Hagel\u2019s hasty exit became evident. Putting ego aside, therefore, must be one of Carter\u2019s supreme strengths.\n\nThat last statement leads to reason number three. Carter will soon find out what Former Secretary Clinton and Secretary Kerry have found out over at State. In this administration, you hold the horse and the title, but you don\u2019t get to ride or touch the reins. Were secretaries Gates and Panetta to be fully candid\u2014putting their egos aside\u2014they might confess that it was this president who served in their post and micro-imposed policy within their department. So, reason number three means that despite Carter\u2019s strong experiential qualifications, he will have little so say about the direction of his troops.\n\nAs Americans, we are grateful for all of the above because a good man, humble but skilled, will take one for the team\u2014and the team is us. We can only hope that despite his humility, his ego is sufficiently robust to apply his vast national defense knowledge to the benefit of American foreign policy and prepare well the foundation for a national defense re-build after 2016, if the voters make that possible.\n\nHaving said all of that, one can only wonder why Carter accepted the job. Whether he was dragooned, politically waterboarded, or what, we don\u2019t know, but we\u2019d have to conclude the pressures on him must have been enormous. In the Coliseum of this administration, Carter will need every weapon available to fight the lions.\n\nWarren is an author of fiction and a political observer with three decades of government and corporate experience.
