Even though their hair dressing business was still thriving, they lost everything they had worked for.\n\nThe new owners of the salon kept them on as managers and Paul says their entire focus shifted and they both realised that real happiness lay\n\nin going back to basics and doing what they love \u2014 creating wonderful hair styles for their clients.\n\nOnce one of the most glamorous couples among Belfast\u2019s movers and shakers, they now lead a very private life, choosing to focus on their careers and their two girls Joni (13) and Ava (11).\n\nPaul and Leisa, both 46, have been together since they were 18 years old.\n\nTheirs is a romantic love story that began when they met in their mid-teens. At the time, both were sharing flats with friends in Belfast\u2019s University area.\n\nPaul, who had a flamboyant fashion sense even then and who still champions the mod look favoured by the likes of Paul Weller and Bradley Wiggins, says he had a bit of a battle on his hands persuading Leisa to give him a chance at romance.\n\nHe recalls: \u201cI pursued her relentlessly. She thought I was gay and it was only when I realised that the way to her heart was through her mouth and invited her out for a pizza that we finally became a couple.\n\n\u201cDid I mind that she thought I was gay? No. I had a lot of friends who were gay and I was outrageous and did dress in a rather flamboyant way. It was never an issue for me if people thought I was gay, as I never had any hang ups about it.\n\n\u201cOh, and Leisa still loves her food. She could eat chocolate all day long if she wants and she is still the same size as the day I met her.\u201d\n\nDespite that initial date, Paul says he had to work hard to win Leisa\u2019s heart: \u201cI knew from the start that we got on very well and there was real chemistry between us, but Leisa wasn\u2019t easy to win over. She was a real free spirit and very independent, and she still is.\u201d\n\nLeisa\u2019s recollection is slightly different. She remembers writing to Paul as a friend when he returned home to his mum\u2019s house in Dundalk. With no mobile phones back then she\u2019d had to resort to pen and paper. She says: \u201cI don't think I thought Paul was effeminate in any way, it was more to do with the fact that virtually all the men I knew in hairdressing were gay, so I just presumed he was, too.\n\n\u201cI was only 17 or 18 and it seems mad to think that now, but in 1984/85 I didn't know many, if any, straight male hairdressers.\n\n\u201cI've always loved my food but the pizza story is only partly true. It's true he did treat me to a dingy pizza but I was too proud to accept, even though he insisted, so I declined the offer of a drink or any toppings on the pizza,\u201d she says.\n\nAs their romance was blossoming so were their careers, which have run along parallel lines from the start.\n\nPaul started work in trendy Belfast salon Zakks while Leisa began her career working with Alan Boyce and Co \u2014 one of the biggest and most progressive hairdressing companies in Northern Ireland in the Eighties and Nineties.\n\nPaul says: \u201cAlan Boyce was doing some really exciting things with his company, including a lot of shows alongside the likes of Trevor Sorbie and Sassoon and he took Leisa under his wing.\n\n\u201cHe was an incredible mentor and he and Leisa persuaded me to come on board, too.\n\n\u201cLeisa and I had the skills to visualise what he wanted and we couldn\u2019t get our hands dirty enough as we worked behind the scenes of those big shows in London.\n\n\u201cWe both became really dedicated to the creative side of hairdressing early on, thanks to that experience.\n\n\u201cAlan then went on to bring Toni and Guy to Northern Ireland, which wasn\u2019t what we wanted to do, so we went out on our own. We wanted to find a creative platform for Northern Ireland hairdressing and make a name for ourselves.\n\n\u201cI was more of a session stylist while Leisa was more creative and we loved working on fashion shoots. We weren\u2019t making any money; we just did it for the sheer love of it.\u201d\n\nZakks recognised the pair\u2019s passion and talent and employed them to develop a training school for the salon.\n\nThey opened a small subsidiary salon called Morrisons (after Van Morrison) which became the creative wing of Zakks.\n\nEvidently, those were heady days when the world really was their oyster. The couple felt invincible as they launched their own collections driven by a desire to not just put themselves on the map but bring Northern Ireland recognition for its hairdressing talent.\n\nThis genuine desire to elevate the industry as a whole here has seen them gain the respect of colleagues who, Paul says, stood by them in the dark days following their bankruptcy proceedings.\n\nHe says: \u201cThe industry was very supportive of us and welcomed us back with open arms. There was no begrudgery and no resentment and they made us feel it was very much where we belong.\u201d\n\nBack in the Nineties, their reputation as educators had got them the recognition they were after and the Northern Ireland-based hairbrush brand Denman was the first of many to approach them to represent them at trade shows in the US and Far East.\n\nIt was the start of the globetrotting side of their career which continues today.\n\n\u201cWe seemed to be constantly jumping on planes, going to places like Washington, New York, Indiana, Chicago and it was really exciting,\u201d says Paul.\n\n\u201cIt was an exciting time all round in Northern Ireland. There were chefs like Michael Deane, Paul Rankin and Robbie Millar doing incredible things with food and great clothes shops opening in Belfast and great bands like Ash and Therapy? making their mark.\n\n\u201cWe just seemed to be part of this explosion of creativity in Belfast during that decade.\u201d\n\nThe couple were cleaning up at national and international award competitions, reinforcing their image as leaders in their field.\n\nPaul won British Hairdresser of the Year three times and Leisa picked up the award in 2004 \u2014 a moment that remains the most memorable for her in a career filled with highlights.\n\nShe says: \u201cI've always supported Paul in his shoots and seminars but it was lovely to win Hairdresser of the Year myself in 2004.\n\n\u201cMy main interest is being behind the scenes creating looks for fashion shows and editorial magazine work. I'd prefer to see an image I've created than see my name in lights \u2014 though it was a huge honour to win the Belfast Telegraph Woman of the Year in Hair, Beauty and Fashion Award this year.\u201d\n\nNew York became a regular haunt and soon won a place in the couple\u2019s hearts \u2014 so much so that in 1999 they chose their beloved Big Apple for a romantic wedding with just the two of them.\n\nLeisa recalls: \u201cNew York City is a very special place to us and actually, though getting married was important, what I really wanted to do was to start a family. I\u2019d never been that maternal but it just seemed like the right time.\n\n\u201cSo off to New York we went and got married \u2014 no fuss, no guests, just a crazy week of fun, food and being together. It was perfect and it's exactly what I'd do if I were doing it again.\u201d\n\nIt was in the hope of emulating the edgy New York vibe they both loved that they took their first huge business gamble in 2003 and opened a showcase 6,000 square foot salon in Belfast\u2019s Golden Mile on Great Victoria Street.\n\nOn par with any upmarket salon in any top city in the world, it offered hair, beauty, a coffee shop and art gallery under one roof.\n\nBelfast had never seen anything like it and with 55 stylists, the Staffords\u2019 salon became the place where the most stylish men and women across Ireland knew they would get the latest look.\n\nBut after five years the first signs that a recession was on its way were already being felt. The couple saw the writing on the wall and decided to close the shop and open a smaller salon on the Lisburn Road.\n\nLooking back, Paul says: \u201cThere was a change in atmosphere and the good times were coming to an end and people were being more careful about how they were spending their money.\n\n\u201cWe got out at the right time because when the recession hit we would never have survived.\u201d\n\nEven though the salon on the Lisburn Road has continued to thrive, the couple were devastated to lose it when the property market crash led to their bankruptcy proceedings in 2012.\n\nIt was a traumatic time and a huge learning curve for both of them.\n\nPaul confesses that they paid the price for getting caught up in empire building and had lost sight of their real love and talent for creating great hair.\n\nPaul says: \u201cIn retrospect it was the biggest challenge we ever faced in our lives and a real test not just of our ability as hairdressers but also of ourselves as a couple from a marital point of view.\n\n\u201cIt felt like it was us against the world and we had to dig in and be strong.\n\n\u201cI had dark periods and went into a very dark place but it gave me back my love of hairdressing.\n\n\u201cNow all I think about is hair. We\u2019ve had the best and worst of times and now we are inspired to work a lot harder and it\u2019s all very exciting again.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great to be real and to be focused on the creative side once more. \u201c\n\nLeisa feels similarly humbled by the experience and says that while it was an incredibly tough time, it also helped her to put life into perspective.\n\nShe explains: \u201cThe thing about our financial problems was that it made me realise what is important in life \u2014 and it's not material possessions.\n\n\u201cPaul and I became incredibly strong during that period; it was life-changing but not life-threatening. It was a dark time but in a strange way I feel better for it. I learned about myself and what I'm about.\u201d\n\nThey are both as passionate as ever about hairdressing, but listening to them talk, there is no doubt that their priority is their two girls Joni and Ava, who both love ballet and gymnastics. They also have three adored dogs, Archie, Albert and Angus.\n\nLife now is very much focused around family and work and Paul confesses that for the sake of his girls he pledged four years ago to stop drinking so that he could \u201cgrow up with them\u201d.\n\nHe says: \u201cI made a sacrifice to the girls to stop drinking, which is vitally important to our relationship. I wanted to grow up with them so that they could have the full benefit of having me as a dad, which is something I lost a little bit of with my own dad.\n\n\u201cIt the best thing I have ever done and we do everything together. We don\u2019t socialise much anymore but the girls aren\u2019t our friends we are mum and dad to them and we have a very definite relationship and we have great fun together.\n\n\u201cThe kids make my life complete and everything I do is for them.\u201d\n\nWorking so hard and being parents is a juggling act for the couple and Paul confesses that it mainly falls on Leisa to ensure the girls get to their classes.\n\nLeisa doesn\u2019t argue the point.\n\nShe adds: \u201cWith ballet, gymnastics and birthday parties, it's a rushing game every day and it's always me they come to when they lose a blazer or need a lift somewhere, but I always seem to manage, somehow! They come first.\u201d\n\nExpert Paul shares his style secrets at Belfast fashion showcase\n\nPaul Stafford will be sharing his \u2018Salon Secrets\u2019 at this year\u2019s Directory 15 fashion and style showcase next week.\n\nDirectory 15, Northern Ireland\u2019s premier style event, sponsored by ALFAPARF Milano and Decoderm Make-up Care, runs from next Wednesday, September 24, to Friday.\n\nPaul will be part of a team of some of Northern Ireland\u2019s best-known names in fashion, hair and make-up who will be coming together to celebrate and showcase timeless, accessible, affordable, bespoke style solutions for women across Northern Ireland at every age.\n\nThe top team will be ready with tips, advice and style solutions for every fashion dilemma.
