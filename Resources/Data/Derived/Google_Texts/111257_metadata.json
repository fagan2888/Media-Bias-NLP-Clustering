This is not a poignant moment at the end of a movie, it\u2019s a poignant moment at the end of a moviemaker\u2019s career.\n\nAssociated Press Hayao Miyazaki, one of animation\u2019s most admired and successful directors, adjusts his glasses during a press conference explaining his retirement in Tokyo Friday, Sept. 6.\n\nHayao Miyazaki, one of Japan\u2019s most important filmmakers, explained Friday his reasons for calling it quits, after a glittering career that saw him raise the artistic standards of Japanese animation and establish global popularity for its distinctive aesthetic.\n\nHaving said several times in the past that he would retire, Mr. Miyazaki, 72, insisted that this time it was for real.\n\n\u201cMy time for long animated films has come to an end,\u201d he said, noting that he was tiring and losing concentration more easily. \u201cI need to step away from the desk half an hour sooner than I would have needed to when I was making \u2018Ponyo,\u2019\u201d he added.\n\nAnother movie would now take six or seven years to complete, he said, longer than in the past.\n\nAlso at the heart of his decision is his unwillingness to compromise on his approach in a rapidly developing industry. Mr. Miyazaki still relies on hand-drawing when animation around the world is all about computer graphics, an approach that does not lend itself to a rapid turnaround of ideas into finished work.\n\nAsked for a signing off message for his fans across the world, he said in typically laconic style: \u201cWatch the movies, everything I want to say is there.\u201d\n\nHis dynamic depiction of nature and supernature writ large grabbed the hearts of moviegoers around the world. His films were brimming with blue skies, vast oceans, bracing winds, supernatural creatures, memorable characters and offbeat technology.\n\n\u201cI wanted to tell children that this world is worth living in,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile the songs of his movies are sung by kindergartners, the broader themes underlying his work appeals to adults. Behind friendly characters, many of Mr. Miyazaki\u2019s films explore such profound topics as the futility of war and the awesome power of nature while casting doubt on the drive for material prosperity.\n\n\u201cHe was the first person, at least in the field of animated films, who was able to produce stories and pictures integrating human, nature and science \u2013 these three subjects \u2013 in harmony. And he was the best,\u201d said Mikiro Kato, professor of cinema studies at Kyoto University.\n\nBorn in 1941, 11 months before Pearl Harbor, Mr. Miyazaki spent his childhood drawing war planes. His career path was set after watching the fantasy film \u201cPanda and the Magic Serpent\u201d as a teenager. Japan\u2019s first color animated feature left a deep impression on him, in part because it was a domestic production. While he had hoped to create Japanese manga (comic books), he instead decided to become an animator. His first film, \u201cThe Castle of Cagliostro,\u201d was released in 1979.\n\n\u201cNausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind\u201d in 1984 was his first major success, landing him an array of national awards. He helped establish Studio Ghibli the following year so he and his colleague Isao Takahata could focus on producing high-quality animated films. The studio became an animation powerhouse in Japan, scoring one commercial hit after another.\n\nBut it was \u201cSpirited Away\u201d that made Mr. Miyazaki and Ghibli almost synonymous with Japanese animation worldwide. While it became the biggest-grossing Japanese film ever, its international release gained Mr. Miyazaki plaudits from around the globe, establishing him as one of the world\u2019s leading animators, and vastly expanding the international market for Japanese animation.\n\nThe film won the Golden Bear at the 2002 Berlin International Film Festival and an Oscar for Best Animated Feature in 2003.\n\nCalling time on his movie-making exploits, Mr. Miyazaki said he wants to spend time improving his studio\u2019s museum, as he always intended.\n\nHis departure from an active role in movie-making will leave a big hole to fill in Japan\u2019s film industry, which hasn\u2019t grown over the last decade.\n\n\u201cAmong all the choices of movies, TV, cell phones and Internet, the younger generation is definitely shifting toward the Net when it comes to entertainment in their spare time. For them, it\u2019s a nuisance and a risk to go to a theater and shell out Y1,300 ($13),\u201d said Takashi Uchiyama, professor of media economics at Aoyama Gakuin University.\n\nSo will Mr. Miyazaki offer a hand in future projects at Studio Ghibli? Nah, he says, it\u2019s time to leave it to others to take over. But he\u2019ll be pottering around and if anyone sees him \u2013 including younger staff or children at the studio\u2019s day care center \u2013 he still wants to project a certain image.\n\nWhile getting older, he said, \u201cI need to keep standing up as straight as I can, as I continue living.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Hayao Miyazaki, one of Japan's most important filmmakers, explained Friday his reasons for calling it quits, after a glittering career that saw him raise the artistic standards of Japanese animation.", "title": "Miyazaki Signs Off Saying: Life Is for Living", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/japanrealtime/2013/09/06/miyazaki-signs-off-saying-life-is-for-living/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OB-YU669_miyaza_G_20130906073726.jpg"}, "site": "wsjasia", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "World", "article.headline": "Miyazaki Signs Off Saying: Life Is for Living", "description": "Hayao Miyazaki, one of Japan's most important filmmakers, explained Friday his reasons for calling it quits, after a glittering career that saw him raise the artistic standards of Japanese animation.", "article_section": "World", "author": "Kosaku Narioka", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Japan Real Time Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Japan Real Time", "article.summary": "Hayao Miyazaki, one of Japan's most important filmmakers, explained Friday his reasons for calling it quits, after a glittering career that saw him raise the artistic standards of Japanese animation.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2013-09-06T11:42:00-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-138", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/japanrealtime/2013/09/06/miyazaki-signs-off-saying-life-is-for-living/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-JRTB-14884", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "World", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Hayao Miyazaki, one of Japan's most important filmmakers, explained Friday his reasons for calling it quits, after a glittering career that saw him raise the artistic standards of Japanese animation.", "title": "Miyazaki Signs Off Saying: Life Is for Living", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/japanrealtime/2013/09/06/miyazaki-signs-off-saying-life-is-for-living/", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OB-YU669_miyaza_G_20130906073726.jpg", "height": 369}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Japan Real Time", "article.id": "BL-JRTB-14884", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2013-09-07T04:18:54-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1367\"", "article_summary": "Having said several times in the past that he would retire, Mr. Miyazaki, 72, insisted that this time it was for real.\nCalling time on his movie-making exploits, Mr. Miyazaki said he wants to spend time improving his studio\u2019s museum, as he always intended.\nBorn in 1941, 11 months before Pearl Harbor, Mr. Miyazaki spent his childhood drawing war planes.\nBut it was \u201cSpirited Away\u201d that made Mr. Miyazaki and Ghibli almost synonymous with Japanese animation worldwide.\n\u201cMy time for long animated films has come to an end,\u201d he said, noting that he was tiring and losing concentration more easily."}
