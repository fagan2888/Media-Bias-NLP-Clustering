Spokespersons for Planned Parenthood have denied illegal conduct.\n\n\u201cIn the aftermath of the recent videos and disclosures about Planned Parenthood, members of the House of Delegates have raised concerns about whether state funds are being provided to this organization,\u201d Armstead said.\n\n\u201cThis request to DHHR is an effort to determine whether state funds are, in fact, being provided to Planned Parenthood and, if so, how we can ensure that no state funding is provided to that organization. This is not an effort to eliminate state funding for necessary, non-abortion related healthcare services which assist women across our state. Rather, it is an attempt to make sure that taxpayer funding is instead provided to other healthcare providers that retain the trust and confidence of our citizens.\u201d\n\nPlanned Parenthood South Atlantic\u2019s website says it operates one clinic in West Virginia.\n\nIn a statement provided to The Daily Signal, Paige Johnson, the vice president of external affairs for Planned Parenthood South Atlantic, said:\n\nIt is unfortunate that Speaker Armstead is using the thoroughly and widely discredited video attacks against Planned Parenthood to push a political agenda. From the beginning, these attacks on Planned Parenthood and the care we provide have been about one thing\u2014banning safe and legal abortion and smearing Planned Parenthood\u2019s trusted name. Planned Parenthood in West Virginia does not participate in fetal tissue donation, nor does it provide abortion services, underscoring the purely political motivation behind the Speaker\u2019s letter to DHHR today.\n\nAccording to Alliance Defending Freedom, there are 317 federally qualified women\u2019s health clinics and public health centers in West Virginia.", "article_metadata": {"description": "West Virginia House Speaker Tim Armstead sent a letter to the state's DHHR asking for \u201cdetailed information\u201d about any payments made to Planned Parenthood.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "West Virginia House Speaker Tim Armstead sent a letter to the state's DHHR asking for \u201cdetailed information\u201d about any payments made to Planned Parenthood.", "title": "W.V.
