The civil case from Todd Bertuzzi’s 2004 attack on Avalanche winger Steve Moore during a Vancouver-Colorado game has been settled about a month before it was scheduled to be heard in a Toronto courtroom, according to Sportsnet and ESPN reports. Moore, who suffered a concussion, three fractured vertebrae and has not played hockey since the attack, was seeking $38 million to $68 million in damages.

Colleague Terry Frei covered that game in 2004. His original game story published in The Denver Post from that night in Vancouver is here.

Television analyst that night: “The score settling has gone too far” and “That’s likely to cost Todd Bertuzzi”
