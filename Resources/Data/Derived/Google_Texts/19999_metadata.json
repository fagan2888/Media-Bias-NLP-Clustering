Parents recommended teaching their kids about such funds, and sites like Jezebel and The Frisky lauded the concept. One writer shared how a fuck-off fund helped them to leave abusive situations, while another recounted how challenging it can be to gather even that bare minimum. At Refinery29, Lindsey Stanberry took issue with the questionable financial choices Perhach recounts, asking, \u201cWhy does almost everyone insist on talking to women about money like we\u2019re idiots?\u201d It makes sense that it struck such a nerve when you consider that most Americans have less than $1,000 in savings, according to a December 2015 Google Consumer Survey.\n\nWhile Perhach details the practical implications of not having such a fund, there are also emotional costs involved. \u201cI have been in a situation where I haven\u2019t had [one]. It feels terrible,\u201d Perhach told Salon. \u201cYou\u2019re always scared when you\u2019re broke. You can\u2019t afford mistakes, you can\u2019t afford surprises. When you have money, you feel more calm.\u201d\n\nPerhach, a 33-year-old Seattle writer who detailed the economic struggles that led to her moving back home with her mom for Salon in 2013, not only saved up her fuck-off fund, but also paid off about $20,000 of debt between 2012 and 2015 thanks in large part to Excel\u2014and outside accountability. Inspired by listening to financial author Dave Ramsey\u2019s podcast, she started both an Excel spreadsheet listing all her bank accounts and their totals, and a blog she told a handful of people about. The only one who read it consistently was her best friend\u2019s mom, but that minimum amount of outside accountability was enough to keep her motivated.\n\nPerhach has also gotten creative about how she handles her money, knowing that it\u2019s not her strong suit. Despite her impressive savings, she says, \u201cI\u2019m really bad with money,\u201d but has found a way to turn her weakness into a strength. \u201cTaking the shame off that for myself and just saying that and not expecting myself to be magically good with money\u201d has made a world of difference. For instance, for a while, she paid her rent in two checks per month, when she received her paycheck, because she didn\u2019t trust herself to do it differently. Even when her boyfriend asked, \u201cCan\u2019t you just keep the money in your bank account?\u201d she knew that she couldn\u2019t promise that.\n\nAccording to Helaine Olen, Slate columnist and co-author of \u201cThe Index Card: Why Personal Finance Doesn\u2019t Have to Be Complicated,\u201d the concept of a fuck-off fund isn\u2019t new. \u201cThis is a concept that\u2019s been around forever,\u201d she said, better known by the term \u201cfuck-you money.\u201d She said it\u2019s a vital concept for everyone (not just women), especially since surveys have shown that anywhere from 40 percent to 76 percent of Americans live paycheck to paycheck. \u201cIt becomes this chicken or egg problem; are they having a hard time because they have access to easy credit or is easy credit out there to help them because our salaries haven\u2019t kept up?\u201d\n\nWherever you\u2019re starting from, Olen emphasizes that even the most minimal efforts toward savings can have a powerful impact and are vital to being able to handle financial contingencies. \u201cIn \u2018The Index Card,\u2019 we say strive to save 10 to 20% of your income,\u201d Olen said but admitted \u201cthat\u2019s a long-term goal.\u201d If you can\u2019t do it all at once, don\u2019t give up entirely. \u201cI would rather see you save $10 a week than have you throw up your hands and say \u2018I can\u2019t save anything.\u2019 It\u2019s a good habit to get into.\u201d\n\nIts effects may extend beyond just your bank account. Olen says having such a fund may lead to more confidence, which can have a ripple effect. \u201cOften when you project confidence, you\u2019re simply treated better,\u201d explained Olen. \u201cI think having this sort of money sometimes helps with that. It allows you to take risks you might not otherwise take; you might take a job that pays lower but you think has better long-term growth, or you decide to move to a different city without a job.\u201d\n\nPerhach agrees. \u201cLet\u2019s say you get a dream job offer, but it\u2019s an internship,\u201d she posited. Maybe the New Yorker offers you an internship in Paris, but it doesn\u2019t pay. With the help of your fuck-off fund, you can consider, in Perhach\u2019s words, \u201cIf I go there, can I work nights and waitress? It gives you that little buffer. You can really look at what\u2019s best for you and take a little more risk if you want to. It\u2019s definitely a fuck-off fund, but if you have $5,000 in the bank, it can be renamed something else, like a dream job fund.\u201d\n\nYet a fuck-off fund isn\u2019t an excuse to be unrealistic about just how far that money can go. When Perhach got accepted into NYU Paris\u2019 low residency MFA program, which she wanted to attend \u201cbadly,\u201d she was even studying French already. But she totaled up all the costs and found it would have been $90,000, far outside her budget, so she declined after having what she calls a \u201chard conversation\u201d with Excel.\n\nNicole Lapin, author of \u201cRich Bitch: A Simple 12-Step Plan for Getting Your Financial Life Together\u2026Finally,\u201d warns that a fuck-you fund is not a career panacea. \u201cEven if you have that fuck-you fund, that\u2019s not going to last forever,\u201d Lapin told Salon. Instead of simply relying on the fuck-off fund as a way to flounce off into the mythical sunset, she urges people to learn about their next step before they actually take it, so if they do quit a bad job, they\u2019re prepared.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Saving up enough money so you can walk off a soul-sucking job or leave a partner is the first step.
