The rest were taken by coal mine operators.\n\nPart of DOL\u2019s 2009 End Black Lung \u2014 Act Now! campaign to raise awareness for the deadly disease that\u2019s caused or contributed to 76,000 coal miner deaths since 1968, the rule is now entering its second phase.\n\nStarting Feb. 1, 2016, mining operators will be required to monitor underground respirable coal dust concentrations with continuous personal dust monitors, or CPDMs. The new devices will provide miners with real-time data on dust concentrations.\n\nWith the CPDMs, Main said miners will be able to not only measure the dust, but assess where it\u2019s the coming from and either choose to manage it or move somewhere else within the air stream.\n\nWhile this rule is advancing to further protect coal miners, the agency has yet to finalize its rule to protect miners from silica dust, which can cause an irreversible lung disease known as silicosis.\n\n\u201cThe rulemaking process is not expedient in how it\u2019s done,\u201d Main said. \u201cWe proposed this rule in October 2010 and issued it in May 2014.\u201d\n\nAs for the final silica dust rule, he said, the agency is still working on it.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t give you a time other than what we have previously announced,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the semiannual regulatory agenda that was released in May, DOL delayed the release of the final rule, due out in October, until April 2016.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "\u201cThis is good news for our miners,\u201d officials say.", "description": "\u201cThis is good news for our miners,\u201d officials say.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Lydia Wheeler", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "\u201cThis is good news for our miners,\u201d officials say.", "title": "DOL: 99 percent of mining industry is complying with coal dust rule", "url": "http://thehill.com/regulation/251395-dol-99-percent-of-mining-industry-is-complying-with-coal-dust-rule", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/coal_mine_052814getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T05:25-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/regulation/251395-dol-99-percent-of-mining-industry-is-complying-with-coal-dust-rule", "dcterms.date": "2015-08-18T16:28-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Lydia Wheeler", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Occupational diseases, Occupational safety and health, Health, Coalworker's pneumoconiosis, Mine Safety and Health Administration, Silicosis, Coal mining, coal dust, Disaster, Environment, Dust,,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-18T16:28:33-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/regulation/251395-dol-99-percent-of-mining-industry-is-complying-with-coal-dust-rule", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "\u201cThis is good news for our miners,\u201d officials say.", "card": "summary", "title": "DOL: 99 percent of mining industry is complying with coal dust rule"}, "dcterms.title": "DOL: 99 percent of mining industry is complying with coal dust rule"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1016\"", "article_summary": "Starting Feb. 1, 2016, mining operators will be required to monitor underground respirable coal dust concentrations with continuous personal dust monitors, or CPDMs.\nOne year in, the Department of Labor (DOL) says its rule to protect miners from the coal dust that causes deadly black lung disease is working.\nOn Tuesday, MSHA\u2019s Assistant Secretary of Labor Joseph Main said 99 percent of the mining industry is complying with the rule.\n\u201cWe proposed this rule in October 2010 and issued it in May 2014.\u201dAs for the final silica dust rule, he said, the agency is still working on it.\nWhile this rule is advancing to further protect coal miners, the agency has yet to finalize its rule to protect miners from silica dust, which can cause an irreversible lung disease known as silicosis."}
