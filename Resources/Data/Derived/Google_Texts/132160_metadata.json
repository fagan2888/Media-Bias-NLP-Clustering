He\u2019s hardly the first president to try buying a little local control. President Nixon handed out grants encouraging local police to get tough on crime.", "article_metadata": {"csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "application-name": "Marketplace from APM", "og": {"url": "http://www.marketplace.org/2015/05/18/life/federal-money-talks-%E2%80%94-kind", "image": "http://cms.marketplace.org/sites/default/files/styles/primary-image-900x500/public/Obama.jpg?itok=ml2HTFfI", "type": "article", "description": "The White House plans to dole out $163 million in grants to local police.", "title": "Federal money talks \u2014 kind of"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Marketplace"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFF", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/assets/mstile-70x70-797ef1ac7d8ffe040b98bab7140abf109b307280019c7d5c16c614ac6f66319d.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/assets/mstile-310x310-9380546aaae2d32ed4a1460d4ffac0ddd0197d240c08a97d9ba80e663f2f42e2.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/assets/mstile-310x150-11f7c8519056bc96bf2540c4b2aa8564178ebcae2594d3e8fb28d480f2c5cd8a.png", "csrf-token": "f4EKIuRIeOmJUI+A9xdq3MCZIiN0EAbNphB0lzFb4ill+0TDO281IngdZ8QAeYirjI3wfpi7E5p54q7trIGw2A==", "msapplication-TileImage": "/assets/mstile-144x144-a9640051fbfb73c1de9771231343135b5f79295e3f98bb1cb87854aa6a74f8c8.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/assets/mstile-150x150-1d103d04b61aaa10bb165f225c46e694338b92918bc7a7ca2b99b54bdd1bbc0c.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "President Barack Obama meets with youth and law enforcement from Camden, N.J., on Monday.\nPresident Nixon handed out grants encouraging local police to get tough on crime.\nThe grants make the medicine go down a bit more smoothly, but the White House\u2019s reach is limited.\nHe\u2019s hardly the first president to try buying a little local control.\n\u201cI think it works,\u201d says Robert Shapiro, a professor of political science at Columbia University, pointing to funding for states to expand Medicaid in the Affordable Care Act."}
