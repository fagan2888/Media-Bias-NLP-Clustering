There, he just happened to run into someone named Sarah Palin, who encouraged him to come out to the summit on Saturday.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s just a cool, down-to-earth person,\u201d Schreiner told Fusion. \u201cWe just mostly made small talk. But from what she said I thought I\u2019d give this a shot.\u201d\n\nThe 21-year-old Schreiner came from a junior college in Washington state, looking for a new college to continue his football career. He left with a couple possible presidential candidates in mind \u2014 retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker.\n\nWalker and Carson were two of the big winners of the weekend summit, which served as the unofficial kickoff for the 2016 Republican presidential primary. Their speeches thrilled the conservative audience here and established them as household names in the all-important, first-in-the-nation caucus state.\n\nBoth also gained legions of new, younger followers, who left impressed by their speeches at the summit. Fusion spoke with more than a dozen young people between the ages of 18 and 28, and either Walker and/or Carson\u2019s names came up in every single conversation.\n\n\u201cI think young people are looking for someone who they can understand, who doesn\u2019t seem fake, and who they can see more as a friend,\u201d 18-year-old Nathan Paulson said. He said Walker\u2019s energy grabbed him, while he sees Carson as someone with the personality to potentially \u201cgrab the younger vote\u201d more than a typical Republican.\n\nMost of Carson\u2019s young conservative supporters pointed to one major advantage: He\u2019s not a career politician. At a time when the public\u2019s perception of Washington is near all-time lows, especially among young people, Carson has a reputation as an outsider who can fix the problems in the system.\n\nThat, along with his scathing criticism of the Affordable Care Act, have made him a rising conservative rockstar. And the phenomenon spans across all ages.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not a typical politician, and he\u2019s got a lot of common sense,\u201d said Vanessa Hutson, a 28-year-old from West Des Moines. \u201cWashington is a nasty clash between the parties, so he is nice to see. He\u2019s somebody with a humble perspective, not just always fighting with the other party.\u201d\n\nBut Carson\u2019s outsider status at times masks his naivet\u00e9. In a side interview on Saturday, Bloomberg Politics\u2019 Mark Halperin asked Carson if he supported President Barack Obama\u2019s willingness to target U.S. citizens in drone strikes if it\u2019s determined they are engaged in terrorist activities. He also asked Carson if he would do the same as president.\n\nCarson hesitated, then said he\u2019d have to study more on the issue. Which leads to the question: How long can he get away with a relative lack of expertise on certain issues, about a year away from the Iowa caucuses? That\u2019s especially pertinent on matters of foreign policy, where he has no experience.\n\nHis young supporters think he\u2019ll get it, eventually. For now, with young people, he\u2019s clearly on the upswing. And for his part, Carson said the key to Republicans winning over younger voters starts on the domestic policy side, where he said he has plenty of ideas.\n\n\u201cThe key thing is you\u2019d prepare policies that demonstrate to them that we\u2019re looking out for their future,\u201d Carson said in an interview with Fusion. \u201cAnd we obliterate those things that are adversely affecting their future.\u201d Three areas he mentioned required fixing were the deficit, student-loan debt, and national-security policies.\n\nWalker, on the other hand, wowed nearly everyone in the audience with a fiery speech, on a day when multiple observers here said his main job was avoiding coming across as too boring \u2014 the 2016 version of former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty.\n\nMost compelling about Walker to attendees was his detailing of his personal story, which he hadn\u2019t revealed in front of a high-profile audience. He told the audience of how he grew up in Plainsfield, Iowa, a not-too-subtle nod that he was one of them.\n\nAnd he told of his battle with public-sector unions in 2011, which led to a recall election in 2012 that he improbably survived. He said he and his wife and children received death threats \u2014 still do.\n\n\u201cHe presented himself extremely well,\u201d said Adam Van Der Molen, a 27-year-old from Johnston, Iowa. \u201cHe\u2019s been through a lot of adversity, and he\u2019s still someone who sticks to his convictions.\u201d\n\nJoe Mitchell, who isn\u2019t old enough to vote yet \u2014 he\u2019s 17 \u2014 but will be next year, added he was impressed by Walker\u2019s highlighting of a record he thinks could translate to the presidency.\n\nRelated Immigration activists will challenge GOP presidential hopefuls in Iowa\n\n\u201cHe laid out the proof of what he\u2019s done,\u201d said Mitchell, who is from Wayland, Iowa. \u201cI think he\u2019d be a great president.\u201d\n\nAttracting young voters is a priority for a party that continues to lack in that department. According to 2012 exit polls, 60 percent of voters aged 18-29 voted for Obama in the 2012 election, compared with only 37 percent who broke for Republican nominee Mitt Romney.\n\nSchreiner, the college linebacker from Washington, is glad the party hooked him so early.\n\n\u201cOh yeah, for sure,\u201d he said, when asked if he could see himself voting for a Republican present at the Freedom Summit for president next year. \u201cI think a lot of them would be great.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://fusion.net/wp-content/themes/fusion-theme/assets/images/favicons/browserconfig.xml?v=1462067892199", "msapplication-TileColor": "#da532c", "pocket-site-verification": "81a5587d6c56043280b2554922f43d", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Fusion", "description": "DES MOINES, Iowa \u2014 Shane Schreiner wasn\u2019t expecting to come to the Iowa Freedom Summit during his weekend in the Hawkeye State.", "title": "Why Young Republicans Want a Retired Neurosurgeon to Run for President", "url": "http://fusion.net/story/40434/iowa-freedom-summit-ben-carson-scott-walker-young-republicans/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://i1.wp.com/fusion.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/462076218.jpg?resize=1200%2C630&quality=80&strip=all", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "DES MOINES, Iowa \u2014 Shane Schreiner wasn\u2019t expecting to come to the Iowa Freedom Summit during his weekend in the Hawkeye State.", "title": "Why young Republicans want a retired neurosurgeon to run for president", "url": "http://fusion.net/story/40434/iowa-freedom-summit-ben-carson-scott-walker-young-republicans/", "image": "http://i1.wp.com/fusion.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/462076218.jpg?resize=560%2C294&quality=80&strip=all", "site": "@fusion", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Fusion.net", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6a5260d31ead375c331934cb6df4833"}, "fb": {"app_id": 796694167041552}, "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://fusion.net/wp-content/themes/fusion-theme/assets/images/favicons/mstile-144x144.png?v=1462067892199", "application-name": "Fusion.net", "msvalidate.01": "0EABD001D404EA9DDE2025E9E4F14CAF", "google-site-verification": "BKw_9qDU04u2w1WoNF53fplAwWXVK_DJ1b6rZDR5u-M", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "DES MOINES, Iowa \u2014 Shane Schreiner wasn\u2019t expecting to come to the Iowa Freedom Summit during his weekend in the Hawkeye State."}, "article_summary": "\u201cI think young people are looking for someone who they can understand, who doesn\u2019t seem fake, and who they can see more as a friend,\u201d 18-year-old Nathan Paulson said.\nHe left with a couple possible presidential candidates in mind \u2014 retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson and Wisconsin Gov.\nDES MOINES, Iowa \u2014 Shane Schreiner wasn\u2019t expecting to come to the Iowa Freedom Summit during his weekend in the Hawkeye State.\n\u201cI think he\u2019d be a great president.\u201dAttracting young voters is a priority for a party that continues to lack in that department.\nThere, he just happened to run into someone named Sarah Palin, who encouraged him to come out to the summit on Saturday."}
