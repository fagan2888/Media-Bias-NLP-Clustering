Well, if he wants to do that, he should probably learn the difference between a strategic bomber and the F-35.\n\nDuring an interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt, Trump was asked if the Pentagon really needs a new strategic bomber or \u201cshould we just stick with submarines and missiles?\u201d\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s Why 'President Trump' Might Dump the F-35\n\n\u201cNow when you talk about the bomber, here\u2019s what I don\u2019t like. I have been reading, and I read one article in particular, where the pilots, and these are great test pilots, and pilots generally, but pilots in testing it said our old planes are better. They perform better. They handle better. Every aspect, they were saying they\u2019re better,\u201d he replied.\n\nTrump went on: \u201cSo I\u2019m saying wait a minute, if they\u2019re better, why are we ordering these unbelievably expensive planes? So I would have some real problems because of cost, and I know I could get the cost down. But what bothers me tremendously is the fact that I heard test pilots saying that the old planes maneuver better, work better, and they like them better. That bothers me.\u201d\n\nThe response is an almost verbatim critique to the one Trump gave the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter when he appeared on Hewitt\u2019s show last month.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hearing that our existing planes are better. And one of the pilots came out of the plane, one of the test pilots, and said this isn\u2019t as good as what we already have. And to spend billions and billions of dollars on something that maybe isn\u2019t as good,\u201d Trump said of the roughly $400 billion weapons program at the time.\n\nRelated: Why the New Stealth Bomber Could Cost More Than $100 Billion\n\nLast week the Pentagon awarded Northrop Grumman the contract to develop the new Long Range Strike-Bomber, an effort that could cost well over $100 billion in the coming decades. The firm beat out a joint Lockheed Martin-Boeing team for the lucrative award.\n\nTrump\u2019s penchant for speaking off the cuff has gotten him in trouble before when it comes to national security, like in his campaign announcement when he labeled Army Pvt. Bowe Bergdahl \u2013 who is facing charges in a military court for walking away from his post in Afghanistan in 2009 \u2013 as a \u201ctraitor.\u201d\n\nIn August, Trump claimed a retired Army colonel was one of his advisers on the topic, when in reality the two had never met. And there are his claims that as commander in chief he would \u201cbomb the hell\u201d out of Iraq\u2019s oil fields in order to choke funding for ISIS.\n\nHewitt tried to steer the real estate mogul back on track, saying \u201ca lot of people like the F-18 Super Hornet more than the F-35, but this B-3, the strategic bomber, I think we have to have bomber, but I will probably be bringing this up in Las Vegas\u201d at next week\u2019s GOP debate.\n\nRelated: How Congress Gave the Pentagon a $5 Billion Haircut\n\nTrump agreed national security should be a key topic, but didn\u2019t seem to take the hint.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re putting up the dollars, we\u2019re spending unbelievable dollars, and when you talk about planes costing that amount of money, can it be done for less? I guarantee you it can be done for not less, but much, much less. But you check this out. The pilots that were testing it did not like it as much as the old equipment. That\u2019s not good, and I think you would agree with that, Hugh,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Friday, the Lockheed-Boeing team filed a protest with the Government Accountability Office about the bomber award, charging the Pentagon\u2019s selection process was flawed.\n\nThe GAO has 100 days to review the protest and issue a ruling.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Donald Trump didn\u2019t serve in the military, but he has repeatedly boasted he\u2019s the only Republican presidential candidate who can transform how the Defense Department does business and revamp the armed services.
