But one organization\u2019s newest ploy is tapping into its bank of creepy GIFs featuring the \u201cartist formerly known as Prince\u201d in an effort to sway those not yet enrolled.\n\nIn an email sent to supporters Tuesday, Organizing for Action, the nonprofit spurned from the president\u2019s reelection campaign, encouraged potential donors to help with the \u201cfinal push\u201d to spread the word about Obamacare and incentivized their need with a chance to win a trip to Washington, D.C., to meet President Barack Obama in the flesh. Though the organization is no stranger to recruiting supporters of the Affordable Care Act, OFA decided to top off their email with a few GIFs of Prince to sweeten the deal.\n\n\u201cThis is your chance,\u201d the message reads. \u201cThere\u2019s no good reason not to get in on this.\u201d\n\nPrince is featured staring at the reader as he moves across the screen, raising an eyebrow as if to say, \u201cduh.\u201d\n\nOFA goes on to encourage email recipients to make a pledge to spread the word about Obamacare. The president\u2019s signature healthcare law rolled out Oct. 1 with a nonfunctioning health insurance exchange, millions of cancellation notices from insurance companies and skyrocketing premiums and deductible. As a result, enrollment figures fall far short of the Obama administration\u2019s projections, resulting in an 11th-hour push for enrollment in the law as the end of the open enrollment period, March 31, quickly approaches.\n\nThose who do commit to spreading the word about the Affordable Care Act are automatically entered into a drawing to meet the president at OFA\u2019s National Organizing Summit on Feb. 25. Hotel and airfare, the group boasts, are included.\n\n\u201cSeriously, what are you still waiting for?\u201d the email states.\n\nThe message closes with a GIF of the \u201cKiss\u201d singer staring with his eyebrows raised in a way that echoes, \u201cseriously? Go.\u201d\n\nThe deadline to sign up to meet President Obama is tonight at midnight.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Supporters of the Affordable Care Act have pulled out all the stops in encouraging Americans to sign up for insurance under the new healthcare law, from bros doing keg stands to celebrity endorsements.
