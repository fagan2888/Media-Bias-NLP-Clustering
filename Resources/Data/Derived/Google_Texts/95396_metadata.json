In a perfect world, it might make sense for Republicans to at least feign a willingness to consider an Obama nomination \u2014 even if they secretly commit to blocking any appointment.\n\nThe problem is that the base doesn\u2019t trust Republican leadership enough to allow them the latitude to make such sagacious strategic moves.\n\nOr, as The Atlantic\u2019s Ron Fournier quipped,\n\nThis: people don\u2019t trust their party enough to lie. https://t.co/FgpgPaEuc5 \u2014 Ron Fournier (@ron_fournier) February 15, 2016\n\nTo be fair, we are talking about a lame duck president making a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court. It\u2019s understandable to me why conservatives would want to use every means available to employ delay tactics. So I\u2019ll frame it a bit more generously than Fournier: Imagine a football team that is so afraid its running back will fumble the ball that it won\u2019t even allow the quarterback to fake a hand-off. Imagine a team that doesn\u2019t trust its other players enough to allow them to ever employ deception.\n\nThis, of course, is nothing new. In fact, Republican leadership has been plagued by this for years now. Here\u2019s just one example, which comes from a 2013 Jonathan Chait story:\n\nA few months ago, Eric Cantor was ready to bring his latest brainchild, the \u201cHelping Sick Americans Now\u201d bill, to the House floor. The move was pure Cantor \u2014 a smarmy, ultrapartisan ploy. The bill proposed to eliminate funds the Obama administration needs to set up and run the health-care exchanges that are the central mechanism in the health-care law, but then Cantor\u2019s bill would use those funds to help a handful of sick people get health insurance. There was no chance this, or anything like it, would be signed into law, as Obama obviously would not agree to tear down a program to insure millions of Americans in return for insuring a tiny fraction of that number. It was a message vote whose purpose was \u201cembarrassing Obamacare,\u201d as one conservative activist gloated, by forcing Obama to deny immediate aide for the uninsured. As a soulless exercise in disingenuous spin, it was well conceived. It failed, however, because a crucial faction of ultraconservative House Republicans threatened to vote against it.\n\nHere you had Eric Cantor using legislative maneuvers to play games. It\u2019s easy for us to look down our noses at this type of gamesmanship. But the interesting thing is that the people who should like it \u2014conservatives ostensibly willing to do whatever it takes to outmaneuver Obama \u2014 were the ones to cry foul. Cantor, according to Chait, at least, was attempting to use deceit to make Obama look bad and score some political points. But his own \u201cside\u201d wouldn\u2019t let him.\n\nWhether you want to blame a paranoid base \u2014 or a faithless and perfidious GOP establishment \u2014 one thing is obvious: If your side is perpetually required to telegraph every play before the run it, you don\u2019t stand a very good chance of winning many public opinion battles.\n\nAnd so, they lose.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Matt K.
