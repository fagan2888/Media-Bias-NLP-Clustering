The Huffington Post says it’s “still not taking the bait” in covering Donald Trump as legitimate political news, doubling down on comments it made last month about covering the Republican presidential candidate exclusively in its entertainment section.

The news outlet made headlines last month after denouncing Mr. Trump’s White House bid as a sideshow. “If you are interested in what The Donald has to say, you’ll find it next to our stories on the Kardashians and ‘The Bachelorette,’” The Post’s Washington bureau chief Ryan Grim and editorial director Danny Shea said in a statement explaining the move.

When asked if The Post had considered changing its position since Mr. Trump’s surge in popularity, Mr. Grim and Mr. Shea blasted competing media outlets for being “seduced” by the business magnate.

“We’re more committed to the decision than ever,” the pair told AdWeek in a statement. “Over the last month, we’ve seen our central argument proven right: that Trump is nothing more than a sideshow and not a legitimate presidential contender with serious policy ideas for moving the country forward.

“The GOP debate was fantastic reality TV, but it came across more like a twisted political version of ‘American Idol’ than a presidential debate,” the statement continued. “And subsequent coverage reveals a collective media frenzy that’s embarrassing to credible media outlets — witness this weekend’s pandemonium around Trump’s helicopter at the Iowa State Fair. Otherwise serious journalists are being seduced by Trump because of his willingness to say and do outrageous things for headlines and ratings. We’re still not taking the bait.”
