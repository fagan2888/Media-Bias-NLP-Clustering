But at the same time, only 11 groups will be getting reductions for low quality or high spending.\n\nDr. Michael Kitchell initially welcomed the federal government\u2019s new quality incentives for physicians. His medical group in Iowa has always scored better than most in the quality reports that Medicare has provided physicians in recent years, he said.\n\nBut when the government launched a new payment system that will soon apply to all physicians who accept Medicare, Kitchell\u2019s McFarland Clinic in Ames didn\u2019t win a bonus. In fact, there are few winners: out of 1,010 large physician groups that the government evaluated, just 14 are getting payment increases this year, according to Medicare. Losers also are scarce. Only 11 groups will be getting reductions for low quality or high spending.\n\n\u201cWe performed well, but not enough for the bonus,\u201d said Kitchell, a neurologist. \u201cMy sense of disappointment here is really significant. Why even bother?\u201d\n\nWithin three years, the Obama administration wants quality of care to be considered in allocating nine of every 10 dollars Medicare pays directly to providers to treat the elderly and disabled. One part of that effort is well underway: revising hospital payments based on excess readmissions, patient satisfaction and other quality measures. Expanding this approach to physicians is touchier, as many are suspicious of the government judging them and reluctant to share performance metrics that Medicare requests.\n\n[See also: CMS to cut Medicare rates after April 15 if SGR bill not approved.]\n\n\u201cWithout having any indication that this is improving patient care, they just keep piling on additional requirements,\u201d said Mark Donnell, MD, an anesthesiologist in Silver City, N.M. Donnell said he only reports a third of the quality measures he is expected to. \u201cSo much of what\u2019s done in medicine is only done to meet the requirements,\u201d he said.\n\nThe new financial incentive for physicians, called a physician value-based payment modifier, allows the federal government to boost or lower the amount it reimburses physicians based on how they score on quality measures and how much their patients cost Medicare. How physicians rate this year will determine payments for more than 900,000 of them by 2017.\n\nMedicare is easing physicians into the program, applying it this year only to medical groups with at least 100 health professionals, including physicians, nurses, speech-language pathologists and occupational therapists. Next year the program expands Medicare to groups of 10 or more health professionals. In 2017, all remaining physicians who take Medicare\u2014along with about 360,000 other health professionals\u2014will be included. By early in the next decade, 9 percent of the payments Medicare makes to physicians and other professionals would be at risk under a bill that the House of Representatives passed in March.\n\nThe quality metrics used to judge physicians vary by specialty. One test looks at how consistently physicians keep an accurate list of all the drugs patients were taking. Others track the rate of complications after cataract surgery or whether patients received recommended treatments for particular cancers.\n\nThere are more than 250 quality measures. Groups and physicians must report a selection \u2014generally nine, which they choose \u2014 or else be automatically penalized. This year, 319 large medical groups are having their reimbursements reduced by 1 percent because they did not meet Medicare\u2019s reporting standards.\n\n[See also: How rural Atlantic General Hospital became a leader in revenue cycle.]\n\nPhysicians who do report their quality data fear the measures are sometimes misguided, usually a hassle and may encourage providers to avoid poorer and sicker patients, who tend to have more trouble controlling asthma or staying on antidepressants, for instance.\n\nLeanne Chrisman-Khawam, MD, a primary care physician in Cleveland, said many of her patients have difficulty just getting to follow-up appointments, since they must take two or three buses. She said those battling obesity or diabetes are less likely to reform their diets to emphasize fresh foods, which are expensive and less available in poor neighborhoods. \u201cYou\u2019re going to link that physician\u2019s payment to that life?\u201d she asked.\n\nHamilton Lempert, MD, an emergency room physician in Cincinnati, criticized one measure that requires him to track how often he follows up with patients with high blood pressure.\n\n\u201cMost everyone\u2019s blood pressure is elevated in the emergency department because they\u2019re anxious,\u201d Lempert said. Another metric encourages testing the heart\u2019s electrical impulses in patients with non-traumatic chest pain, which Lempert said has led emergency rooms to give priority to these cases over more serious ones.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just very frustrating, the things we have to do to jump through the hoops,\u201d he said.\n\nIn their first year physicians are affected by the program, they can choose to forgo bonuses or penalties based on their performance. After that, the program is mandatory. This year, 564 groups opted out, but even if all of them had been included, only 3 percent would have gotten increases and 38 percent would have seen lower payments, mostly for not satisfactorily reporting quality measures, Medicare data show.\n\nSmaller groups and solo practitioners are even less likely to report quality to the government. \u201cThe participation rates, even though it\u2019s mandated, are just really low,\u201d said Alyna Chien, MD, an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School. It\u2019s \u201ca level of analytics that just is not typically built into a doctor\u2019s office.\u201d\n\n[See also: These 779 hospitals will actually receive Medicare bonuses [full list].]\n\nLisa Bielamowicz, MD, chief medical officer of The Advisory Board, a consulting group, predicted more physicians will start reporting their quality scores when the prospect of fines is greater. \u201cThey are not going to motivate until it is absolutely necessary,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you look at these small practices, a lot of them just run on a shoestring.\u201d\n\nThis year\u2019s assessments of big groups were based on patients seen in 2013. A total of $11 million of the $1.2 billion Medicare pays physicians is being given out as bonuses, which translates to a 5 percent payment increase for those 14 groups getting payment increases this year. That money came from low performers and those that did not report quality measures to Medicare\u2019s satisfaction; they are losing up to 1 percent.\n\nThe exact amount any of these groups lose will depend on the number and nature of the services they provide over the year. This year, 268 medical groups were exempted because at least one of their physicians was participating in one of the government\u2019s experiments in providing care differently.\n\nOfficials at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services declined to be interviewed about the program but said in a prepared statement that they have been providing all physicians with reports showing their quality and costs. \u201cWe hope that this information will provide meaningful and actionable information to physicians so that they may improve the coordination and integration of the health care provided to beneficiaries,\u201d the statement said.\n\nKaiser Health News (KHN) is a nonprofit national health policy news service.
