And those numbers show the non-profit insurer continuing to spend about nine of every 10 cents it takes in on buying healthcare.\n\nAs to what the 2014 financial results mean for 2016 premiums, Excellus spokesman Jim Redmond said Friday that, \u201cIt\u2019s too soon to say.\u201d\n\nEnrollment took a big, 300,000-person dip in 2014, to 1.3 million enrollees across upstate. That decline in members meant Excellus\u2019 income was down notably, as was the amount of money it spent at area hospitals and doctors\u2019 offices.\n\nExcellus makes the vast majority of its money from monthly premiums. And for 2014, that amounted to $5.9 billion, down from $6.3 billion in 2013.\n\nAnd most of that money, in turn, goes to pay hospital and medical benefits. In 2014, Excellus wrote $5.2 billion worth of checks to area hospitals, doctors\u2019 offices and related healthcare providers, compared with $5.7 billion in 2013.\n\nRedmond said much of that enrollment decline came from the insurance company pulling the plug on numerous Medicaid-related products last year. \u201cWe pulled out of 14 counties ... so we no longer had those claims and we no longer had the income from those 150,000 members,\u201d Redmond said. Most of those enrollees were in central New York, and the insurer quit offering those insurance products because of government-set reimbursement rates, he said.\n\nExcellus\u2019 enrollment rolls also dipped as the state began self-insuring its employees, meaning that 150,000 state workers who had been considered Excellus members are now Empire BlueCross BlueShield because the state government is based in Albany \u2014 a territory Empire covers \u2014 though Excellus still serves those people, Redmond said.\n\nThe administrative cost of running Excellus was up nearly $100 million over 2013, amounting to $570 million in 2014. But all of that increase and more was due to a new, Affordable Care Act-related tax of $137 million, according to Excellus. Minus that healthcare reform tax bill, administrative costs would have actually have been $48 million less than they were in 2013, Redmond said.\n\nAccording to Excellus, that $137 million actually represents a pair of new taxes that come as part of the Affordable Care Act \u2014 $91 million the insurer is paying as a fee imposed on insurers, and $45 million it is paying in reinsurance fees which have been imposed on all commercial health coverage.\n\nThose Affordable Care Act bills are not a one-time expense, Redmond said. \u201cIt will be annual, and probably increasing.\u201d\n\nAfter expenses, Excellus had a slim profit of $24.2 million, down from $52.6 million in 2013. That came from $116 million the insurer made on its various investments. Minus that, Excellus would have lost $55.3 million\n\nThe C-Suite\n\nThe 10 top-paid executives at Excellus BlueCross BlueShield combined made nearly $7.4 million in 2014. By far, the most handsomely paid was CEO/President Christopher C. Booth, who received a total of $1.8 million. Other major earners in 2014 included Chief Financial Officer Dorothy A. Coleman, who earned $852,000, and General Counsel Stephen Sloan, who earned $781,000.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.rocne.ws/1BIHjqn", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "The insurance giant filed its 2014 financial results Friday with the state.", "og": {"site_name": "Rochester Democrat and Chronicle", "description": "The insurance giant filed its 2014 financial results Friday with the state.", "title": "Excellus sees big dip in enrollees, big Obamacare bill", "url": "http://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/money/2015/02/27/excellus-sees-big-dip-enrollees-big-obamacare-bill/24133377/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/democratandchronicle.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The insurance giant filed its 2014 financial results Friday with the state.", "creator": "@DandC", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b22eac58fa5d70fab61d898ffb60b7f2d1e42a4b/c=1200-0-1860-660&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Rochester/2015/02/27/B9316414095Z.1_20150227164329_001_GVNA351SH.1-0.jpg", "title": "Excellus sees big dip in enrollees, big Obamacare bill", "site": "@DandC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600028377", "fb": {"app_id": 176958652324613}, "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"category": "money", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f8f0dfb80c8dccb7a33e6b6a9e0871f73e2a63b8/c=1282-0-1777-660/local/-/media/Rochester/2015/02/27/B9316414095Z.1_20150227164329_001_GVNA351SH.1-0.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/fa68d9b6eeb1fc1e7d28907356eead185560c35c/c=1200-0-1860-660/local/-/media/Rochester/2015/02/27/B9316414095Z.1_20150227164329_001_GVNA351SH.1-0.jpg", "contenttype": "data", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/eec5d2b184d65942a92cd422ff548ecdce1905ca/c=1090-0-1970-660/local/-/media/Rochester/2015/02/27/B9316414095Z.1_20150227164329_001_GVNA351SH.1-0.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9dd4b8423e43d92ebb5308ec1f32371ad61482c5/c=944-0-2117-660&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/Rochester/2015/02/27/B9316414095Z.1_20150227164329_001_GVNA351SH.1-0.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-02-27T15:26:28-05:00", "shorthed": "Excellus sees big dip in enrollees", "articleid": 24133377, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/47e586d26c8ea9b2071a87639cc3fdb6d1ccc5a9/c=944-0-2117-660/local/-/media/Rochester/2015/02/27/B9316414095Z.1_20150227164329_001_GVNA351SH.1-0.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4683698938a02743c1bbae52d03ce12d8bc20267/c=1344-0-1715-660/local/-/media/Rochester/2015/02/27/B9316414095Z.1_20150227164329_001_GVNA351SH.1-0.jpg"}, "author": "Matthew Daneman", "title": "Excellus sees big dip in enrollees, big Obamacare bill", "pageclass": "article", "gci-asset-type": "data"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/mdanemanmedia"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Excellus, Obamacare, Medicaid, Christopher Booth, Affordable Care Act"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe001f\"", "article_summary": "Excellus BlueCross BlueShield filed its 2014 financial results Friday with the state Insurance Department.\nBut all of that increase and more was due to a new, Affordable Care Act-related tax of $137 million, according to Excellus.\n\u201cWe pulled out of 14 counties ... so we no longer had those claims and we no longer had the income from those 150,000 members,\u201d Redmond said.\nThe area\u2019s dominant insurance company ended 2014 just slightly in the black, despite a big drop in members and a much bigger tax bill related to the Affordable Care Act.\nThat decline in members meant Excellus\u2019 income was down notably, as was the amount of money it spent at area hospitals and doctors\u2019 offices."}
