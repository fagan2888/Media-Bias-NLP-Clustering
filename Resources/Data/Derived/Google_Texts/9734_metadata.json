There\u2019s no compilation clip; you\u2019ll have to make do with the C-SPAN embed by fast-forwarding to the time cues I give you and being patient while the vid buffers (and buffers, and buffers). At 1:10:55 he describes the \u201croyal prerogative\u201d that the Constitution was designed to eliminate but which Obama, through the growth of the administrative state and his own expansive view of executive discretion, is now flirting with. At 2:53:45, he applies that concept to O\u2019s war powers, specifically vis-a-vis Libya and the White House \u201ckill list.\u201d If you have time for only one snippet, though, skip to 2:33:00 for his list of Obama\u2019s five most egregious violations of separation of powers. Some are familiar to you \u2014 declaring that he wouldn\u2019t deport illegals who might qualify for DREAM, refusing to enforce the employer mandate, etc \u2014 but the ones about him shifting money around without regard to how Congress has appropriated it might not be. Turley makes two valuable points here. One: Courts tend to give the executive a wide berth in separation-of-powers challenges on the theory that Congress has the power of the purse and can defund any executive agency it likes. But that\u2019s not true anymore, he says. Obama, by defying appropriations, has claimed some of that power for himself. What check does Congress have left? That brings us to point two: Even if Congress can\u2019t stop Obama, the courts can. The problem there, though, says Turley, is that O and the DOJ have argued successfully in many cases that no one has standing to sue him because no one can show an injury from his power grabs that\u2019s concrete enough to justify a federal lawsuit. So the courts can\u2019t check him either.\n\nThe only check is to beat him at the polls, and since he\u2019s now term-limited, there\u2019s no real check there apart from his party\u2019s fear that they\u2019ll be punished for his excesses instead. Show of hands: Who thinks Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi will keep Obama in line? Before you answer, note that leading amnesty shill Luis Gutierrez argued at this same hearing that, if anything, Obama should have a freer hand so that he can go about unilaterally legalizing the illegals Gutierrez has been effectively representing in Congress for years. That\u2019s what\u2019s left of Democratic opposition to the imperial executive.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Royal prerogative.", "title": "Liberal law prof: Obama\u2019s unconstitutional power grabs are creating a \u201cvery dangerous and unstable system\u201d", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2013/12/03/liberal-law-prof-obamas-unconstitutional-power-grabs-are-creating-a-very-dangerous-and-unstable-system/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "keywords": "ACA, constitutional, kill list, Obama, ObamaCare, prerogative, royal, turley,", "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-04T01:01:38+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-12-03T23:15:58+00:00"}, "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9bb3\"", "article_summary": "Liberal law prof: Obama\u2019s unconstitutional power grabs are creating a \u201cvery dangerous and unstable system\u201dposted at 8:01 pm on December 3, 2013 by AllahpunditGood stuff from Jonathan Turley at today\u2019s House hearing on executive power, although I regret that I couldn\u2019t find a more user-friendly format for you to watch.\nThat brings us to point two: Even if Congress can\u2019t stop Obama, the courts can.\nThere\u2019s no compilation clip; you\u2019ll have to make do with the C-SPAN embed by fast-forwarding to the time cues I give you and being patient while the vid buffers (and buffers, and buffers).\nObama, by defying appropriations, has claimed some of that power for himself.\nWhat check does Congress have left?"}
