In addition, Ventas and Health Care REIT both have what they call \u201cseniors housing operating portfolios\u201d alongside their triple-net lease senior housing portfolios.\n\nBut there are risks involved with senior living communities and other healthcare properties owned in a REIT Investment Diversification and Empowerment Act (RIDEA) structure, according to a recent post on the Foley & Lardner LLP blog, Health Care Law Today.\n\nOperational performance risk\n\nIn a traditional triple-net lease agreement, the third-party company that manages a community on behalf of the REIT landlord typically assumes operational risks, says Foley & Lardner.\n\nBut the Taxable REIT Subsidiary (TRS) created for RIDEA-structured deals means that REITs must also share risk at the operational level. If a community performs well and produces outsize revenue and income, the REIT benefits along with the manager. But the converse is true as well: underperforming communities can drag down REIT revenue since the landlord isn\u2019t guaranteed the same stability a triple-net lease affords.\n\nLegal risk\n\nPrior to RIDEA being passed in 2007, REITs were \u201cpassive\u201d landlords and utilized triple-net lease structures, notes Foley & Lardner. Under those lease agreement, REITs were \u201clargely removed from liability for health care and regulatory issues with only the most general, but indirect, duty of care tied to premises liability doctrines (i.e. not patient care),\u201d says the blog post.\n\nBut with RIDEA deals, REITs now own a stake in the TRS, which is typically the licensed community operator. Health Care Law Today points to some headlines in the past several months\u2014including the Frontline/PBS investigative series on Emeritus and a nursing home conglomerate that includes Ventas slammed with a $1.1 billion verdict for \u2018corporate greed\u2019\u2014illustrating the risks inherent in these \u201cskin in the game\u201d joint ventures.\n\nReputational risk\n\nSimilar to legal risk, REIT reputations may be at stake in a RIDEA-structured deal since they have a stake in the TRS management company. Rather than focus resting solely on a third-party manager in a high-profile wandering case or a lawsuit alleging wrongful death, any and all stakeholders may come under scrutiny.\n\nWays to mitigate these risks, says Foley & Lardner, include careful management selection and operator agreement underwriting, and an appropriate compliance infrastructure for all parties involved.\n\nRead more at Health Care Law Today.\n\nWritten by Alyssa Gerace", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "brookdale senior living, hcp inc., health care reit, pbs, ventas, business, finance, real estate, senior housing", "og": {"site_name": "Senior Housing News", "description": "Most of the major healthcare-focused real estate investment trusts have utilized the RIDEA structure for at least some of their deals in the seven or so years it\u2019s been available, but the structure bears risks as well as reward, warns a law firm in a Read More \u00bb", "title": "3 Risks REITs Take With RIDEA-Structured Deals - Senior Housing News", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://seniorhousingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Newspapersbizbriefs.jpg", "url": "http://seniorhousingnews.com/2014/05/26/3-risks-reits-take-with-ridea-structured-deals/", "type": "article"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"admins": 661268364}, "google-site-verification": "m2JqrSaoHES8Fk-PLPrg4_UM8oiLgSF_xP6GWwK1sZw", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/seniorhousingnews-175913563443/timeline/", "section": "Management & Operations", "tag": "Ventas", "published_time": "2014-05-26T15:37:24+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "But the Taxable REIT Subsidiary (TRS) created for RIDEA-structured deals means that REITs must also share risk at the operational level.\nBut with RIDEA deals, REITs now own a stake in the TRS, which is typically the licensed community operator.\nIn addition, Ventas and Health Care REIT both have what they call \u201cseniors housing operating portfolios\u201d alongside their triple-net lease senior housing portfolios.\nRead more at Health Care Law Today.\nLegal riskPrior to RIDEA being passed in 2007, REITs were \u201cpassive\u201d landlords and utilized triple-net lease structures, notes Foley & Lardner."}
