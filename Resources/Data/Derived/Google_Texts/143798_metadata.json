Practically overnight, he became one of the most prominent and promising Hispanic public officials in the country. His name already is being bandied about as a possible vice presidential running mate for Hillary Clinton in 2016.\n\nAnd just yesterday, he celebrated his 40th birthday.\n\nJulian Castro, the former mayor of San Antonio, Texas and President Obama\u2019s new secretary of Housing and Urban Development, is one of the freshest faces in the nation\u2019s capital -- a politician with seemingly limitless opportunities. But a big question that remains to be answered is whether he can successfully use HUD as a springboard to higher office.\n\nRelated: Will Julian Castro Suffer the HUD Curse?\n\nAfter just seven weeks in office, Castro for now appears fixated on running a major bureaucracy with 8,500 employees and a $47 billion annual budget. He assumed the post at a time when \u201cthere is evidence of renewed weakness in the U.S. housing market\u201d that has policy makers and private economists nervous, according to Reuters.\n\nAs the Obama administration\u2019s newest housing cheer leader and advocate, Castro declared in a speech on Tuesday, \u201cWe come together at a time when our economy is growing, a time when American businesses have created 10 million new jobs over the last four and a half years . . . and a time when the housing market has gotten strong, with home sales, starts and values all rising in recent years.\n\n\u201cThese are days of tremendous progress across the board, and now our charge is to accelerate this progress for every American,\u201d he said during closing remarks at a two-day housing summit sponsored by the Bipartisan Policy Center. \u201cThat\u2019s where HUD comes in.\u201d\n\nCastro also outlined a series of challenges suggesting this newcomer to Washington has his work cut out for him:\n\nHe warned, for instance, that after the U.S. finally dug itself out of an historic economic crisis and housing market collapse triggered by a reckless real estate industry and secondary markets that provided billions of dollars in mortgages to unqualified buyers, \u201cthe pendulum has swung too far in the other direction.\u201d\n\nRelated: Two Housing Markets for the Two Americas\n\n\u201cToday, it\u2019s too hard\u201d to get a mortgage loan, he told the audience. \u201cThe truth is that the dream of homeownership is out of reach for too many Americans. This has to change.\u201d\n\n\u201cA government-dominated market is unsustainable,\u201d he added. \u201cInstead, we need to attract private capital back to the market, establish certainty for lenders and protect taxpayers for the future.\u201d\n\nCastro \u2013 the former mayor of the seventh largest city in the U.S. -- gained national attention in 2012 when he became the first Latino chosen to deliver the keynote address at the Democratic National Convention. It was a time when immigration reform was a dominant issue in the presidential campaign and the Democratic Party was eager to preserve the allegiance of a substantial Hispanic voting bloc.\n\nCastro and his identical twin brother Joaquin are Democratic success stories. The two brothers grew up in San Antonio, attended Stanford University and Harvard Law School, and then returned to their native city to launch their political careers. Joaquin Castro is now a member of Congress from Texas.\n\nRelated: Bernie Sanders Could Undercut Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 Run\n\nThe affable, well-spoken Julian Castro amassed an impressive record in urban renewal and economic recovery as mayor of San Antonio. Some analysts have said that by succeeding Shaun Donovan as HUD secretary, Castro will be in position to help forge housing, employment and economic policy that is critical to lower and middle income Americans who comprise a critical part of the Democratic base.\n\n\u201cI will judge my tenure by one standard: how well did we spark opportunity for Americans?\u201d he said yesterday. \u201cWith the stakes so high we cannot afford to fail.\u201d\n\nWith his broad appeal to Hispanic voters and his considerable experience dealing with urban problems in Texas, Castro is likely to emerge as a player as the 2016 presidential campaign approaches.\n\nThe Washington Post published a front-page story in August highlighting Castro\u2019s vice presidential prospects and reporting that Hillary and Bill Clinton have been aggressively \u201ccultivating\u201d Castro; they also invited him to their home in Washington for a private dinner.\n\nRelated: Hillary Clinton Says the 2016 Election Is on Her Mind\n\nHenry Cisneros, a former HUD secretary himself in the Clinton administration, told The Post that in March he sat next to Hillary Clinton at a private luncheon in New Mexico where Cisneros said they discussed Castro and his political future.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a natural friendship waiting to bloom,\u201d Cisneros, also a former San Antonio mayor and a longtime family friend and political mentor of Castro, told the Post.\n\nSteve Elmendorf, a Washington lobbyist and former House Democratic adviser, said yesterday of Castro that \u201cthe guy is very appealing\u201d and seems a natural to be included in a list of potential vice presidential candidates next year.\n\n\u201cI think for any presidential candidate, the choice will come down to, do you pick somebody like that who brings some great energy and diversity, or do you pick somebody who brings along a state? Castro\u2019s problem is that he doesn\u2019t bring Texas.\u201d\n\nRelated: Rising Star Julian Castro to Join Obama Cabinet\n\nCastro should beware: For decades, the job of HUD secretary has proved to be a political graveyard or improbable launching pad for higher office.\n\nEven Cisneros who served as secretary of HUD from 1993 to 1997 fell victim to the curse. In March 1995, an Independent Counsel was appointed to investigate allegations that Cisneros lied to the FBI during background investigations prior to being appointed secretary.\n\nLater, after leaving office, Cisnero pleaded guilty to a single misdemeanor charge of having lied to the FBI about money he had paid to a mistress before joining the Clinton administration. He subsequently paid a $10,000 fine.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Julian Castro, the former mayor of San Antonio, TX and President Obama\u2019s new secretary of Housing and Urban Development, is one of the freshest faces in the nation\u2019s capital and a politician with seemingly limitless opportunities.
