The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says salmonella poisoning has sickened at least 416 people spread out over 23 states.\n\nThe chicken plant\u2019s cockroaches infestation has actually been an ongoing problem based upon a letter submitted by the USDA:\n\n\u201cThese recent findings of egregious insanitary conditions related to a cockroach infestation in your facility indicate that your establishment is not being operated and maintained in sanitary conditions.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, cockroaches can carry viruses and bacteria, including salmonella, and spread them into whatever they come into contact with.\n\nOver the last five months Foster Farms have been notified four times that they\u2019ve been infested. But in the fall of 2013 the company claimed they had \u201csubmitted and implemented immediate substantive changes to their slaughter and processing to allow for continued operations.\u201d They also claimed the chicken plant\u2019s cockroaches hadn\u2019t affected any of their products.\n\nThe interesting part about the laws is that USDA inspectors aren\u2019t allowed to be in place when the chicken plant is actually operating. Some critics have claimed the USDA only took these actions due to the \u201cbad PR,\u201d while others says it\u2019s odd how the federal organization \u201cdoesn\u2019t have the power to shut them down when they poison hundreds of people with antibiotic-resistant salmonella.\u201d\n\nIn response to all the criticism, Foster Farms says it\u2019s dealing with the chicken plant\u2019s cockroaches problem by voluntarily shutting to clean up and \u201cexercise vigilance.\u201d Although the cleanup was supposedly completed on Saturday the facility isn\u2019t running yet, and production has shifted to other locations.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A California chicken plant's cockroaches infestation is so nasty that Foster Farms had to close again even after being cleaned.
