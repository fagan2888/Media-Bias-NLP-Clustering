The added cost has given some diners heartburn and thrust the restaurants\u2019 owners unwillingly into the debate over the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAdditional Images Sarah Huxhold, a server at Milo & Olive in Santa Monica, Calif., will be able to get health insurance coverage because of a 3 percent surcharge on restaurant bills.

The owners he reached out to, Loeb said, all run high-quality spots with many of the same clientele.\n\nMany of the restaurant owners said they had been mulling over providing health insurance for years. They took the plunge after watching the Affordable Care Act pass and seeing other businesses find ways to offer health care for their employees.\n\n\u201cWe decided it would be a good thing to do it as a group,\u201d said Josiah Citrin, the chef-owner of Melisse in Santa Monica. \u201cUsually when lots of people do things it\u2019s easier to make change.\u201d\n\nCitrin joined in even though Melisse doesn\u2019t have enough workers to fall under the employer mandate that starts in 2016. That provision of the act requires businesses with more than 50 full-time workers to provide health insurance. The coverage will be a particular boon to longtime employees who are getting older, he said.\n\nYounger restaurant workers such as Sarah Huxhold are also cheering the surcharge.\n\nHuxhold, a 31-year-old server at Milo & Olive in Santa Monica, said she lost her insurance through work last year after quitting to pursue a career in music. While out of work, her mom helped her buy coverage for about $500 a month, but Huxhold decided it was too expensive and dropped the plan in December.\n\nSince then, she said she has tried unsuccessfully to get insurance through Medi-Cal. She\u2019s been forced to scour Groupon for a deal on eye exams and pinned her glasses together to avoid getting a new pair.\n\nNow that she will have insurance, she plans to get an annual physical and visit the dentist and optometrist.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really excited about having insurance again,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is no way I can pay for those things out of pocket.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Los Angeles restaurants follow the example of those in San Francisco to fund employees' insurance.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "description": "Los Angeles restaurants follow the example of those in San Francisco to fund employees' insurance.", "title": "California diners eating health-care surcharge - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 999, "identifier": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/517068_526196-BIZ_WRK-HEALTHCARE_L.jpg", "height": 730}, "updated_time": "2014-10-10T22:36:22-04:00", "url": "http://www.pressherald.com/2014/10/12/california-diners-eating-health-care-surcharge/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Los Angeles restaurants follow the example of those in San Francisco to fund employees' insurance.", "creator": "@pressherald", "image": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/517068_526196-BIZ_WRK-HEALTHCARE_L.jpg", "title": "California diners eating health-care surcharge - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "site": "@pressherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=951845858", "fb": {"admins": 769488179, "app_id": 178078215650057}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressherald", "section": "Business", "published_time": "2014-10-12T04:00:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-10T22:36:22-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "QWs9pxQP8fwo2-nR5mWopc6qCK2D3920f7bl-U-zkso", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe want our staff to have health care,\u201d said Josh Loeb, the co-owner of several popular dining spots.\nThey took the plunge after watching the Affordable Care Act pass and seeing other businesses find ways to offer health care for their employees.\nMany of the restaurant owners said they had been mulling over providing health insurance for years.\nThat provision of the act requires businesses with more than 50 full-time workers to provide health insurance.\nLast December, Los Angeles restaurateur Bill Chait made a splash by introducing a 3 percent \u201cHealthy LA\u201d charge at his French restaurant Republique."}
