A Panama City Beach man is behind bars after he threw a firebomb near a house on Wisteria Street.

Witnesses say 23 year old Garrett Sadler threw the firebomb he made after he and his girlfriend were arguing with their roommates.

State of Florida Fire Marshall's Office and Panama City Beach Police arrested Sadler Friday and transported him to the Bay County jail.

He's facing charges of possession, manufacturing, and disposal of a firebomb.

The investigation is still ongoing.
