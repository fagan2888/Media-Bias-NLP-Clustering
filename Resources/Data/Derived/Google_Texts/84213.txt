Vigilante Justice: Wanted Cartel Members Found Bound to Lamppost By Police

JP Carroll

Authorities discovered five members of the infamous Nuevo Juarez Cartel suspected of murdering a cab driver bound to a lamppost in the Mexican city of Cuauhtémoc this week.

Authorities are baffled by their good luck in having their prime suspects hand-delivered to them for an easy arrest, reported The Daily Mail. It is not known who did this to the five cartel members.

Given the constant state of insecurity in Mexico, vigilante justice is becoming increasingly common. The Nuevo Juarez Cartel is known to take credit for their crimes, and one of the men had a sign with the gang’s name on it.

Authorities are considering the possibility that fellow gang members handed in the five men as punishment for carrying out an unsanctioned hit job. Authorities have been searching for the cab driver’s killers since Dec. 7, when he was killed.

Another theory being pursued by the authorities is that a rival cartel handed over the 5 gangsters to be arrested. El Chapo’s outfit, the Sinaloa Cartel, is one of the largest rivals of the New Juarez Cartel.

The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration recently reported the Nuevo Juarez Cartel makes at least $200 million per week. This cartel is one of many involved in the multibillion dollar drug trafficking business.
