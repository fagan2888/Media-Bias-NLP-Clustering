Today, I\u2019ll be addressing the strain of front-end costs: premiums.\n\nIn my next column, I\u2019ll tackle the back end, including those intimidating deductibles that must be paid before insurance actually kicks in.\n\nQ: I have cut my family budget, canceled cable and only buy shoes for my kids when they really need them. But I still can\u2019t afford my premium. What should I do?\n\nA: A recent Kaiser Family Foundation survey of 4,555 Californians found that 44 percent of Covered California plan holders, like Chavez, say it\u2019s \u201csomewhat\u201d or \u201cvery\u201d difficult to pay their premiums even though the vast majority of them receive tax credits that subsidize their costs.\n\nIndividuals and families who make between 138 and 400 percent of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) can qualify for Covered California\u2019s sliding-scale tax credits.\n\nFor instance, a family of three making between $27,700 and $80,360 would qualify.\n\nNicole Carr, a Sacramento-area insurance agent, said 5 to 10 percent of her clients canceled their health plans between last year and this year because they couldn\u2019t afford their premiums. They did so even though Obamacare requires most people to have health insurance or face a tax penalty.\n\n\u201cThey realized that the tax penalty (for not having insurance) was going to be less than paying the premium \u2014 even with the subsidy,\u201d she said.\n\nChavez, 46, said she can\u2019t cancel her plan because her husband is sick. Chavez receives $121 in monthly tax credits, leaving a premium of $625. She\u2019s trying to modify her home loan to make up the difference.\n\n\u201cJust thinking about it, I stress out. I have a mortgage. I have two kids in college,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is more expensive than I expected, but I have to find a way to make it work.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf the 88 percent of Covered California plan holders who receive tax credits, about three-quarters pay less than $150 per month on their premiums after the credits are applied, said James Scullary of Covered California.\n\nBut he acknowledges that \u201chealth care costs are still a challenge for many Covered California consumers.\u201d\n\nOne problem, Scullary and others note, is that tax credits are based on a federal standard that doesn\u2019t account for \u201cCalifornia\u2019s high cost of housing, transportation and food,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cLiving on $40,000 in San Francisco may not be the same as living on $40,000 in certain places in the Midwest,\u201d said Rachel Garfield, the lead author of the Kaiser Family Foundation report.\n\nThat\u2019s also true within California, said Scott Graves, director of research at the California Budget & Policy Center.\n\nIn Imperial County on the Mexico border, a single parent with two children would have to spend $748 on a two-bedroom apartment and utilities, he said. In Marin, it\u2019s $2,062.\n\n\u201cThe official federal poverty line is not an accurate measure of a family\u2019s economic security,\u201d he said.\n\nBut premium affordability isn\u2019t unique to Covered California. Individuals and families whose incomes exceed 400 percent of FPL receive no subsidy if they buy plans from the open market. Premiums are even higher for older people, who are charged more than younger ones.\n\nKim Zarcone, 54, of Granada Hills spends about $1,000 a month for a plan that covers her and three of her children.\n\nThe premium is the family\u2019s biggest bill \u2014 bigger than the mortgage. \u201cWe\u2019re middle class,\u201d she said. \u201cWe never go on vacation. My kids are paying for their own college.\u201d\n\nLast year, Zarcone had to drop coverage for three months because the family couldn\u2019t afford it, all the while praying that everyone stayed healthy. \u201cI know a lot of people are being helped,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the Affordable Care Act is not affordable for us.\u201d\n\nI usually end my columns with multiple pieces of advice, but in this case, I only have two:\n\n\u2022 If you\u2019re buying insurance from Covered California or the open market, seek help from a certified insurance agent or enrollment counselor, whose services are free. They can help you price out the best plans for your situation.\n\n\u2022 Check to see if you\u2019re eligible for Covered California tax credits.\n\nI\u2019ll have more advice next time, when I examine the other challenge to affordability: out-of-pocket costs.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to submit a query, email AskEmily@usc.edu.
