A House Democrat has proposed two alternatives to H.R. 1624, a bill that would let each state decide whether to set the maximum size of a small group at 50 employees or 100 employees.

Rep. Frank Pallone, D-N.J., says he would like to see Congress adopt a bill postponing the effective date of the small-group definition change for a few years, or letting states postpone the effective date.
