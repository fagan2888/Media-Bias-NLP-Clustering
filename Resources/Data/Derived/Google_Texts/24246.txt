Former Atlanta Braves broadcaster Pete Van Wieren passed away this morning after a long battle with lymphoma. He was 69.

Van Wieren was in the booth with the Braves between 1975 and 2008. If you ever tuned into a Braves game on TBS you heard the voices of Hall of Fame pitcher Don Sutton, Ernie Johnson, Skip Caray and Van Wieren. Only Sutton remains with us.

I enjoyed Van Wieren’s low key approach behind the mike. He was tremendously knowledgable, but he didn’t let it get in the way of the game.

David O’Brien of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution shares his memories of Van Wieren here.
