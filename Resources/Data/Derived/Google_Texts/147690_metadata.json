Smoke up those skunk weed spliffs while you can. (Don\u2019t bother correcting me in the comments. I have no idea what the kids are calling it these days.) If Chris Christie is elected president your days of happily getting high in the public square are over because the feds will be enforcing the law regardless of what your hippie dippy state legislatures have to say about it. (Bloomberg)\n\nResidents in U.S. states that have legalized marijuana should toke up while they still can, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie said. \u201cIf you\u2019re getting high in Colorado today, enjoy it,\u201d Christie, a Republican campaigning for the 2016 presidential nomination, said Tuesday during a town-hall meeting at the Salt Hill Pub in Newport, New Hampshire. \u201cAs of January 2017, I will enforce the federal laws.\u201d At a time when a majority of Americans say recreational pot use should be legal, and four states have already made it so, Christie remains opposed. The former federal prosecutor said Democratic President Barack Obama has selectively chosen which laws to enforce. \u201cIf you\u2019re getting high in Colorado today, enjoy it.\u201d\n\nRecreational pot is still illegal in New Jersey and Christie has regularly threatened to veto any legislation which might decriminalize it, so he\u2019s not being inconsistent here. Of course, it\u2019s a sure fire way to lose the libertarian, Rand Paul wing of the party but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s particularly concerned with that right now. More likely Christie is looking for his own Trump / Huckabee style moment where the media suddenly starts talking about him again (he\u2019s sort of disappeared from the cable news beat for weeks now) and he gets a shot at having a few angry conservatives rally to his side and bump his poll numbers enough that\u2019s he\u2019s assured a spot on the big debate stage.\n\nWill that work? He\u2019s facing a lot of competition in the Look At Me pageant. Huckabee\u2019s \u201cmarching the Jews to the oven door\u201d comment is currently just about the only thing the press wants to talk about aside from Mr. Trump. Even Rand Paul failed to get much of a media surge when he took a chainsaw to the tax code, and that was a fairly transparent cry for attention. But at this stage of the game it seems like everyone outside of the top five can afford a bit of embarrassment if it saves them from dropping out of the crowded field entirely.\n\nBut to give credit where credit is due, we can at least give a nod to Christie for bringing up the state vs federal supremacy issue, along with the responsibility of the feds to enforce the laws as written, not selectively based on the political winds of the day. It might be nice if some of the other candidates (besides Trump) were getting away from safe topics and digging into the sticky issues of concern to conservatives such as this one. I\u2019m not holding my breath, though. It looks like the top non-Trump guys are mostly sticking to Don\u2019t Rock the Boat mode for now.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Party pooper", "title": "Christie: enjoy your pot now, stoners, because when I\u2019m elected the party\u2019s over", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2015/07/29/christie-enjoy-your-pot-now-stoners-because-when-im-elected-the-partys-over/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@JazzShaw"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-29T13:21:26+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-29T12:56:01+00:00"}, "keywords": "2016 election, Chris Christie, GOP primary, marijuana, medical marijuana, New Jersey, Republican governors,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "article_summary": "Christie: enjoy your pot now, stoners, because when I\u2019m elected the party\u2019s overposted at 9:21 am on July 29, 2015 by Jazz ShawHey, Oregon, Alaska, Colorado and Washington!\n\u201cIf you\u2019re getting high in Colorado today, enjoy it,\u201d Christie, a Republican campaigning for the 2016 presidential nomination, said Tuesday during a town-hall meeting at the Salt Hill Pub in Newport, New Hampshire.\nThe former federal prosecutor said Democratic President Barack Obama has selectively chosen which laws to enforce.\n(Bloomberg)Residents in U.S. states that have legalized marijuana should toke up while they still can, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie said.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re getting high in Colorado today, enjoy it.\u201dRecreational pot is still illegal in New Jersey and Christie has regularly threatened to veto any legislation which might decriminalize it, so he\u2019s not being inconsistent here."}
