In a strong, clear voice, the Court upheld the enforcement of a major federal statute against a state entity that had failed to embrace federal policy with respect to health care. Although not formally a constitutional decision, the Court\u2019s interpretation of congressional intent played out against the backdrop of an important constitutional question: the permissible and appropriate balance between federal lawmaking and residual state authority. And it was the federal government\u2019s seeming disregard of state sovereignty that led what has become the Court\u2019s conservative rump \u2013 here Justice Alito, joined by Justices Scalia and Thomas \u2013 to write bluntly in dissent.\n\nThe case is North Carolina State Board of Dental Examiners v. Federal Trade Commission, not King v. Burwell, and the major federal statute is the Sherman Antitrust Act, not the Affordable Care Act. Oral argument in North Carolina State Board took place last October (David Hyman and I wrote about it here); the Court\u2019s decision was issued on February 25, 2015.\n\nNorth Carolina State Board has nothing to do with \u201cObamacare,\u201d but it may turn out to be the most important health care (and general public law) decision of the year. (Note to Pundits and Hypesters: King v. Burwell will only matter if the Court rules for the plaintiffs, and is unlikely to create enduring law even then. If the government wins, the case will soon be forgotten.) The Supreme Court\u2019s ruling will give professional licensing boards throughout the country significant pause before adopting ad hoc policies that disadvantage competing professionals or non-professionals, and it should lead to a constructive conversation (and perhaps uniform or model legislation) regarding the accountability of self-regulatory bodies to actual state government. Its impact could be comparable to a major revamping of Joint Commission standards for health care facilities \u2013 low in visibility but dramatic in operational change.\n\nWhat The Court Held\n\nThe case concerns cease-and-desist letters sent by North Carolina\u2019s dental licensing board to non-dentist teeth whitening businesses, warning them that the unlicensed practice of dentistry is a crime. The state\u2019s Dental Practice Act does not define teeth whitening as the practice of dentistry, nor does the dental board have specific authority to challenge the conduct of non-licensees in a structured, reviewable process. Alleging a violation of U.S. antitrust law, the Federal Trade Commission brought an enforcement action against the North Carolina board, which in turn claimed immunity under the \u201cstate action doctrine.\u201d\n\nThe Court ruled that the North Carolina board could not invoke state action immunity for its conduct. Taking an approach similar to what was recommended in our earlier post, the Court held that a state professional regulatory board must be subject to active supervision by the state itself if its actions are controlled by active market participants in the occupation the board regulates. The Court was clear that the need for state supervision turns on the practical risk that active market participants will collectively pursue their private interests, and not on the formal designation that the state gives to its instrumentalities.\n\nThe most important issue raised by the Court\u2019s decision is how states will actively supervise their professional licensing boards in the future to validate their actions (and, although it was not part of the North Carolina case, to protect individual board members from incurring legal liability). As the earlier post explained, \u201cCongress responded [to the Supreme Court\u2019s 1988 ruling in Patrick v. Burget] by passing the Health Care Quality Improvement Act of 1986 (HCQIA), which set clear, uniform standards for hospital-based peer review, and immunized providers who complied in good faith with those standards from antitrust liability.\u201d Analogous federal standards for state board conduct are an outside possibility after North Carolina State Board. It is more likely, however, that states will \u201cenact one or more model practice acts that would promote uniformity among boards and assure their accountability to state government.\u201d\n\nFree-market conservatives have long been skeptical of professional monopolies. The Wall Street Journal, for example, supported the FTC\u2019s position. The three most conservative justices on the Supreme Court, however, saw the central issue quite differently. Justice Alito\u2019s very straightforward argument is that an action taken by a state agency is immune from federal antitrust enforcement without any further inquiry into whether the agency actually functions in the public interest. The dissenting justices seemed motivated by a combination of constitutional deference to state sovereignty and their sense of Congress\u2019s original intent when it passed the Sherman Act. As a result, they were particularly disturbed by the Court\u2019s conclusion that a state agency (albeit one composed of active market participants) would be subject to greater constraints than a municipality, which is a non-sovereign entity from a constitutional perspective.\n\nClearing A Path Toward A More Efficient Health Care System\n\nIn 1962, Milton Friedman concluded a scathing critique of medical licensure with the following: \u201cI am myself persuaded that licensure has reduced both the quantity and quality of medical practice; that it has reduced the opportunities available to people who would like to be physicians, forcing them to pursue occupations they regard as less attractive; that it has forced the public to pay more for less satisfactory medical service, and that it has retarded technological development both in medicine itself and in the organization of medical practice.\u201d\n\nWell-intentioned but often insular and unimaginative, many state licensing boards have changed little in the fifty years since Friedman\u2019s polemic. The Court\u2019s decision therefore may help thaw anti-competitive self-regulatory practices that have been largely frozen in time. That the Court\u2019s ruling consists of a clean majority opinion and a clean dissent gives the reasoning in the case a welcome clarity. By contrast, both multiple-opinion (plurality) decisions and unanimous decisions tend to convey hazier messages.\n\nDespite the continuing hype around mandates, taxes, and subsidies, the big issue in health care reform is not redistribution.
