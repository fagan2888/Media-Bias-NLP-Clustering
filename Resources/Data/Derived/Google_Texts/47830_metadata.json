The law, passed last summer, will require all abortion clinics to meet the standards of ambulatory surgical centers (along with a host of other challenging requirements), which will force the vast majority of Texas clinics to shut their doors.

The law would protect abortion rights across the U.S. from targeted state laws meant to erode them.
