She was the only first-grader to vie for a seat.\n\nA classmate decisively shattered Imani\u2019s excitement when she said she refused to vote for her because she\u2019s black.\n\n\u201cIt was really hard as a parent to see that happen,\u201d said Quincy Shannon, Imani\u2019s dad.\n\nShannon, from Denver\u2019s Park Hill neighborhood, said Imani is one of a handful of black students in her school. Ever since his daughter enrolled in Denver\u2019s school for gifted and high achieving students, he\u2019s noticed a change in her demeanor that he attributes to the fact she has few black peers and teachers.\n\n\u201cI know she\u2019s an extreme extrovert,\u201d he said. \u201cBut at school, she\u2019s introverted, and she isolates herself. It\u2019s apparent when she comes to school that she\u2019s alone.\u201d\n\nShannon was one of 300 people who attended a Saturday conference that addressed the needs of black students in the classroom.\n\n\u201cEducating, Connecting with and Loving our Black Children\u201d offered sessions for parents, students and educators to learn about how to connect with black students in the Denver Public School System.\n\n\u201cThis came about because of some of the challenges black boys and girls have in schools,\u201d said Darlene Sampson, DPS\u2019s director of culturally responsive education.\n\nSampson said many teachers don\u2019t appreciate the way black students communicate and express themselves.\n\n\u201cOur kids don\u2019t check their culture at the door,\u201d she said. \u201cThe task of educators is to embrace it.\u201d\n\nShe also noted that personal biases and stereotypes lead some educators to make assumptions about what students can accomplish in the classroom. The result is a low standard of achievement.\n\n\u201cThe greater costs are drop-outs, push-outs and sad and disconnected kids,\u201d Sampson said.\n\nSheila Smith, who\u2019s been an educator in Denver public schools for 14 years, said she\u2019s seen these challenges firsthand.\n\n\u201cIt holds them back,\u201d Smith said. \u201cPeople assume they don\u2019t care or don\u2019t want to learn.\u201d\n\nRhonda Juett, who works to address the social and emotional needs of students, said she\u2019s noticed disproportionate treatment of black students in the classroom, especially when it comes to discipline.\n\n\u201cJust look at the suspension rate of black students,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to work on our own mindset of how we\u2019re working with children of color and build a respectful culture in our schools.\u201d\n\nKaty Canada: 303-954-1043, kcanada@denverpost.com or @KatySusanna", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Conference addresses needs of black students in Denver Public Schools", "title": "Conference addresses needs of black students in Denver Public Schools", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/04/09/conference-addresses-needs-of-black-students-in-denver-public-schools/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-04-09T14:50:23+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-09T14:50:23+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "K-12 education"}, "article_summary": "A classmate decisively shattered Imani\u2019s excitement when she said she refused to vote for her because she\u2019s black.\n\u201cEducating, Connecting with and Loving our Black Children\u201d offered sessions for parents, students and educators to learn about how to connect with black students in the Denver Public School System.\n\u201cJust look at the suspension rate of black students,\u201d she said.\nShannon, from Denver\u2019s Park Hill neighborhood, said Imani is one of a handful of black students in her school.\nSampson said many teachers don\u2019t appreciate the way black students communicate and express themselves."}
