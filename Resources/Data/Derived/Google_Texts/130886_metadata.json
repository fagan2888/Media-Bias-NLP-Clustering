Or if they do know how to do it, they don\u2019t know how to also keep their job, because sooner or later they\u2019re going come against a trade off between unit cost and these other important attributes.\u201d\n\n\n\nLearning from Other Industries\n\nAs different as they are, the electronics and apparel industries share a similar history when it comes to their supply chains. Both were exposed in the media for abusing the environment and the people laboring to make their products; both suffered real financial pain as a result of the negative press; and both responded by creating data-driven coalitions of otherwise competitive companies to address the environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues involved.\n\nWhen the electronics industry began working on the challenge with BSR in 2004, it quickly became apparent that, \u201cimprovement was not going to be driven if all the suppliers in east Asia and elsewhere were being presented with large numbers of conflicting requirements from buyers,\u201d Olson explained. \u201cWe needed to get together, agree on root causes, agree on what acceptable and good practices would look like, and then we had to agree on the protocols that would guide everything from auditing to remediation.\u201d\n\nThings did not go smoothly at first. There were stormy meetings, as the group of eight companies went through the \u201cstorming and norming\u201d phase of building a collaborative team. But eventually the storms abated, as \u201cwe found pre-competitive space in one of the most competitive industries on the planet,\u201d said Olson. By working on common issues that would benefit all concerned, the group came to see clearly the value of what could only be done together.\n\nThe group was spun off by BSR in 2008, and today the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC) has 100 members that generate combined annual revenues exceeding $3 trillion. All of these companies \u2014 which directly employ more than 5.5 million people and have another 3.5 million contributing to the production of their products \u2014 abide by the EICC Code of Conduct, governing labor, ethics, environment, and health and safety.\n\nWhile there are still plenty of challenges facing the EICC, Olson said that successes to date have included these three key elements:\n\nGetting the governance right: \u201cWhat are we trying to achieve, what are the rights and responsibilities of those who join, what truly are pre-competitive issues where we can afford and benefit from collaborating, and what areas are just out of bounds?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are we trying to achieve, what are the rights and responsibilities of those who join, what truly are pre-competitive issues where we can afford and benefit from collaborating, and what areas are just out of bounds?\u201d Investing in the right transparency mechanisms: \u201cWe\u2019re tantalizingly close to a step-change. The infrastructure has just gotten so much better, with the cloud offering the ability to share information without having the mother of all management software systems.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re tantalizingly close to a step-change. The infrastructure has just gotten so much better, with the cloud offering the ability to share information without having the mother of all management software systems.\u201d Taking a practical approach: \u201cWe\u2019ve had to satisfy ourselves with a subset of information that we can actually get our hands on, believe and take action on when we get it. The train wrecks have been when people overbuilt \u2014 went for way more information than they were ever going to be able to take action on.\u201d\n\nIn 2010, a remarkably similar process led to the creation of the Sustainable Apparel Coalition (SAC). At the time, \u201cbuyers throughout the industry were receiving an ever-increasing number of audits and surveys,\u201d said Scott Miller, director of business development for SAC. Many of the questions were redundant, he said. \u201cAnd nothing was getting better. The manufacturers were simply becoming expert audit takers.\u201d\n\nIndustry Outreach\n\nIn response to the situation, the senior management at Walmart approached the senior management at Patagonia about coming together to develop a universal standard for the measurement of sustainability in the apparel industry. Joined by 10 other companies, the group consulted with other stakeholders and came up with the Higg Index. (The name isn\u2019t significant; it was painstakingly devised to be inoffensive in all languages.)\n\nThe Higg Index was first created in Excel and focused only on environmental sustainability. As feedback came in, SAC made revisions, moved from spreadsheets to a sophisticated, transparent online platform and expanded the index to encompass social and labor issues. Today, more than 6,000 manufacturers and suppliers contribute to the Higg Index, now including both footwear and home textiles. Other industries, including glassware and tableware, also use the Higg Index, because they see major retail customers (such as Macy\u2019s, Target and Walmart) using it.\n\nAs EICC did, SAC worked hard to create a pre-competitive space where competitors \u201ccan literally sit at the same table, as sustainability professionals, and collaborate on improving practices in the supply chain,\u201d noted Miller.\n\nWhere Health Care Fits In\n\nThe challenge facing health care is both the same and different. All three industries \u2014 electronics, apparel and health care \u2014 have faced essentially the same obstacle to sustainability: the redundant collection of disparate data that cannot be meaningfully integrated into the purchasing process.\n\nBut Abrams pointed out some clear differences.\n\nWhile the apparel and information and communications technology (ICT) industries have complicated global supply chains, their suppliers are generally confined to certain key industries. Neither electronics nor apparel \u201cdeals with the huge array of manufacturers that health care does, where you can be talking about everything from endotracheal tubes to baby formula,\u201d said MindClick\u2019s Abrams.\n\n\u201cThere is also a much more manageable number of players in those other industries,\u201d Abrams added. One hundred companies are members of EICC and SAC has 174 members. \u201cIn health care, you\u2019ve got 5,000 hospitals alone, plus all the manufacturers, plus all the GPOs, plus all the clinical services that are in non-hospital settings. The scale of this thing is absolutely massive.\u201d\n\nStill, the experiences of SAC and EICC point to some essential ingredients that any solution in health care ignores at its peril, including most clearly a collaborative system that eliminates redundant and irrelevant data collection, provides transparency and translates data into actionable information. Just as important, SAC and EICC succeeded by starting slowly and growing incrementally over time.\n\nThese lessons have not been lost on health care professionals, who are now in the early stages of creating their own collaborative effort to green hospitals\u2019 supply chains.\n\n\n\nA Daunting Task\n\nA great deal of time, effort and money will be required to make such an index a reality. \u201cAnd at the end of the day there has to be an ROI,\u201d said Abrams. \u201cThe way we approach this is to look at what each stakeholder is looking to get out of the index.\u201d\n\nSuppliers want to know how they compare to the competition. If a manufacturer\u2019s product scores better than a competitor\u2019s, it can use that information to help increase market share. If its product performs poorly, a manufacturer can work to improve the product, provided, of course, that the market justifies the investment. That\u2019s another benefit of a sustainable health care index: It allows suppliers to see how robust the market is for a product with specific EPP attributes.\n\nHospitals and other providers are driven by their mission, and by the changing economics of health care under the Affordable Care Act, to protect and improve the health of the communities they serve. They can use a sustainability index to steer clear of products that can actually aggravate the very conditions they are spending precious resources to alleviate and cure.\n\nAnd with solid metrics to work with, they will be able to evaluate the complex tradeoffs between short-term and long-term costs. Such metrics are less likely to be helpful in marketing, at least in the near future. While a hospital may promote its overall sustainability, it is unlikely to showcase incremental reductions in its use of harmful materials.\n\nGroup purchasing organizations (GPOs) stand to benefit from an index in a variety of ways. Kevin Lewis, national program coordinator at one of the largest GPOs, Premier Inc., noted that as its 3,600 hospital members increasingly look for EPP data they can use in purchasing, suppliers not now on contract with the company will be motivated to sign on. In addition, said Abrams, \u201cContracting is really the tip of the iceberg.\u201d GPOs are really in the business of providing valuable analytics to their members so they will benefit by having a third party that cost effectively provides verified information they can integrate into their own analytical tools.\n\nStrength in Numbers\n\nAs a demonstration of what a sustainable health care index could achieve, six companies recently participated in a case study: Premier, Johnson & Johnson, Steelcase (a furniture and furnishings company) and three health care providers, Edward-Elmhurst Health, Anne Arundel Health and Fairview Health. The results from Edward-Elmhurst were first released at the conference on \u201cSustainability & Health Care: Creating & Capturing Value\u201d at Wharton, co-sponsored by Johnson & Johnson and Wharton\u2019s Initiative for Global Environmental Leadership (IGEL). Since then, results from the other two health care systems have also been released, so \u201cnow all three hospitals are in a position to see how they compare to each other,\u201d explained Abrams, whose company, MindClick, is at the center of the initiative.\n\nThe case study focused on three categories \u2014 endotracheal tubes, furniture and sutures \u2014 and used the Environmentally Preferable Purchasing (EPP) data already being collected. Although the EPP data includes responses to only 25 questions, and only the data from one GPO and two suppliers was used, once that data was matched with a line item list of the purchases Edward-Elmhurst had made in all three categories during the 12 months preceding September 2015, MindClick had more than 300,000 data points to work with.\n\nTo translate those data points into usable information, the MindClick team identified which questions were relevant in each category and sorted responses into three simple categories: Starter, Achiever and Leader. The study revealed that 66% of the $60,000 Edwards-Elmhurst spent on endotracheal tubes during the year went for products that earned Achiever status. The remaining 34% was spent on products not on contract with Premier, and therefore with unknown EPP performance.\n\nSuccess Stories\n\nThe story was even better in the sutures category: 91% of the hospital\u2019s spending was on products at the Leader level from Ethicon, which not only dominates in market share, but also performs at the Leader level across its entire reported product line. No EPP information was available for furniture, because Edwards-Elmhurst purchased all of its furniture during the year from distributors, not Premier. (A what-if scenario demonstrated that if the hospital had purchased products available from Steelcase, 88% would have been at the Leader level, with the remaining 12% rated as Achievers.)\n\nIn total, Edwards-Elmhurst learned that 50% of the money it spent in the three categories purchased products that positively contributed to human and environmental health, but that the other half did not. This knowledge gave the hospital a benchmark against which to measure its progress in the years ahead.\n\nAs in the ICT and apparel industries, health care is building its index slowly and carefully. During the coming year, MindClick will be working with a pilot group of hospitals and a pilot group of categories to create the first phase of the Healthcare Sustainable Purchasing Index (HSPI). Two advisory councils, one for providers and one for suppliers, are also being formed to identify the questions that are most pertinent in each category.\n\nBased on the experiences in other industries, the HSPI will continue growing over the coming years, sharpening the questions that are asked, enlisting the participation of more suppliers, GPOs and providers and building out the robust technology engine that will power the whole enterprise. As it does so, the index will help green a health care supply chain that represents 18% of the nation\u2019s GDP.", "article_metadata": {"MobileOptimized": 320, "description": "A pilot study unveiled at a Wharton conference demonstrated the viability of a new Healthcare Sustainable Purchasing Index (HSPI).", "og": {"site_name": "Knowledge@Wharton", "description": "A pilot study unveiled at a Wharton conference demonstrated the viability of a new Healthcare Sustainable Purchasing Index (HSPI).", "title": "The Promise of Big Data: Revolutionizing Health Care Sustainability - Knowledge@Wharton", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1024, "identifier": "http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/The-Promise-of-Big-Data-1.jpg", "height": 440}, "url": "http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/promise-big-data-information-can-revolutionize-health-care-sustainability/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "For people working to make U.S. health care purchasing more green, it\u2019s not data that\u2019s lacking, it\u2019s discovering the meaningful part. \u201cThat\u2019s the big question now: How can we leverage techn", "creator": "@WhartonKnows", "image": "http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/The-Promise-of-Big-Data-1.jpg", "title": "The Promise of Big Data: Revolutionizing Health Care Sustainability", "site": "@WhartonKnows", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#000", "robots": "noodp", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "fb": {"admins": 1653092227}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/knowledgeatwharton", "section": "Health Economics"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "business, education"}, "article_summary": "Where Health Care Fits InThe challenge facing health care is both the same and different.\nStrength in NumbersAs a demonstration of what a sustainable health care index could achieve, six companies recently participated in a case study: Premier, Johnson & Johnson, Steelcase (a furniture and furnishings company) and three health care providers, Edward-Elmhurst Health, Anne Arundel Health and Fairview Health.\nFor people working to make U.S. health care purchasing more green, it\u2019s not data that\u2019s lacking, it\u2019s discovering the meaningful part.\nAs in the ICT and apparel industries, health care is building its index slowly and carefully.\nHospitals and other providers are driven by their mission, and by the changing economics of health care under the Affordable Care Act, to protect and improve the health of the communities they serve."}
