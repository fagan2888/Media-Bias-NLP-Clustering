He has family from the White Horse and Eagle Butte area who traveled to Sioux Falls to watch him ride.\n\nDespite the extra voices in the crowd, he doesn't feel any extra pressure.\n\n\"Just happy to see them. Life on the road, don't get to spend too much time with family so when they can come and hang out here and do it all at once where I can ride bulls and hang out. It's awesome,\" Lawrence said.\n\nThis is the first time this high level of bull riding has been in South Dakota's largest city. Assistant General Manager of the Denny Sanford PREMIER Center Chris Semrau says the event is a success.\n\n\"The demand is overwhelming. We're going to have two sold out nights of PBR this weekend which is the biggest strategy we have to bring events like this back to Sioux Falls. It's a big deal that they're here and we're glad that the community has supported the event,\" Semrau said.\n\nImmediately after the Summit League Tournament was over, events center staff worked to take out the hardwood and replace it with dirt.\n\nThe riders will wrap up in Sioux Falls Saturday night before heading to Albuquerque for a competition on March 20th.\n\nNews\n\nGeneral {{Title}} Remove Change News General Courts Web Only Crime Outdoors Events Center Non-Homepage Boredom Busters Pipeline Positively KELOLAND Technology Hunger Affordable Care Act Shops Flooding Remembering 9/11 Drought JazzFest Spring Storm Honor Flight Spencer Anniversary\n\nDoApp Health News Business News Sports\n\nAgriculture Markets Livestock Crops Politics\n\nHealthBeat Cancer Children's Health Heart Health Wellness & Nutrition General Health Beat Women's Health RX Resources What's Going Around OTC Diabetes Recalls Dental Health Men's Health\n\nPolitics South Dakota Legislature Budget Congress Taxes General Local Campaign President US Senate New Laws US House Iowa Ballot Issues Local Races Minnesota Gubernatorial\n\nEducation Funding College Elementary High School Pre K School Supplies Middle School\n\nSports Professional College High School Sports Zone Headlines Summit League Tournament Olympics\n\nBusiness Industry Your Money Matters Development Gas & Energy Legislation Economy/Stocks Employment General Health Care Technology Education Funding Tourism Banking/Finance Housing Transportation Insurance Meetings & Events Retail & Restaurants All Industries On The Move Shops Agriculture\n\nFeatured Stories Eye on KELOLAND Inside KELOLAND\n\nWeather Snow Forecast Records Rain Flooding Drought WX Corner General\n\nWorld News\n\nInvestigates GEAR UP\n\nSponsored Done\n\n\u00a9 2016 KELOLAND TV.
