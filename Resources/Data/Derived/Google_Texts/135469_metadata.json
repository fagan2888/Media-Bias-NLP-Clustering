But for many professors today, the reality is quite different: being so poorly paid and treated, that they\u2019re more likely to be found bargain-hunting at day-old bread stores. This is academia in 2014.\n\n\u201cThe most shocking thing is that many of us don\u2019t even earn the federal minimum wage,\u201d said Miranda Merklein, an adjunct professor from Santa Fe who started teaching in 2008. \u201cOur students didn\u2019t know that professors with PhDs aren\u2019t even earning as much as an entry-level fast food worker. We\u2019re not calling for the $15 minimum wage. We don\u2019t even make minimum wage. And we have no benefits and no job security.\u201d\n\nOver three quarters of college professors are adjunct. Legally, adjunct positions are part-time, at-will employment. Universities pay adjunct professors by the course, anywhere between $1,000 to $5,000. So if a professor teaches three courses in both the fall and spring semesters at a rate of $3000 per course, they\u2019ll make $18,000 dollars. The average full-time barista makes the same yearly wage. However, a full-time adjunct works more than 40 hours a week. They\u2019re not paid for most of those hours.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s a three credit course, you\u2019re paid for your time in the classroom only,\u201d said Merklein. \u201cSo everything else you do is by donation. If you hold office hours, those you\u2019re doing for free. Your grading you do for free. \u2026 Anything we do with the student where we sit down and explain what happened when the student was absent, that\u2019s also free labor. Some would call it wage theft because these are things we have to do in order to keep our jobs. We have to do things we\u2019re not getting paid for. It\u2019s not optional.\u201d\n\nMerklein was far from the only professor with this problem.\n\n\u201cIt can be a tremendous amount of work,\u201d said Alex Kudera. Kudera started teaching in 1996 and is the author of a novel about adjunct professorship, \u201cFight For Your Long Day.\u201d \u201cWhen I was an adjunct, I didn\u2019t have a social life. It\u2019s basically just work all the time. You plan your weekend around the fact that you\u2019re going to be doing work Saturday and Sunday \u2014 typically grading papers, which is emotionally exhausting. The grading can be tedious but at least it\u2019s a private thing. It\u2019s basically 5-10 hours a day for every day of the week.\u201d\n\nOne professor from Indiana who spoke to Salon preferred to remain anonymous. \u201cAt some point early in my adjunct career, I broke down my pay hourly. I figured out that I was making under minimum wage and then I stopped thinking about it,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t speak for everyone, but I essentially design my own courses. And sometimes I don\u2019t find out how many courses I\u2019m going to be teaching until maybe Thursday and they start Monday. \u2026 So I have to develop a course, and it\u2019s been the case where one summer I taught English 102 where the course was literally dropped in my lap three days before it started and I had to develop it entirely from scratch. It didn\u2019t even have a text book. That was three 16-hour days in a row developing a syllabus. \u2026 You\u2019re expected to be in contact with students constantly. You have to be available to them all the time. You\u2019re expected to respond to emails generally within 24 hours. I\u2019m always on-call. And it\u2019s one of my favorite parts of my job, I don\u2019t regret it, but if you factored those on-call hours in, that\u2019d be the end of it. I\u2019d be making 50 cents an hour.\u201d\n\nBeing financially secure and teaching at an institute of higher education are almost mutually exclusive, even among professors who are able to teach the maximum amount of courses each semester. Thus, more than half of adjunct professors in the United States seek a second job. Not all professors can find additional employment. An advanced degree slams most doors shut and opens a handful by the narrowest crack.\n\nNathaniel Oliver taught as an adjunct for four years in Alabama. He received $12,000 a year during his time teaching.\n\n\u201cYou fall in this trap where you may be working for less than you would be at a place that pays minimum wage yet you can\u2019t get the minimum wage jobs because of your education,\u201d Oliver said.\n\nAcademia\u2019s tower might be ivory but it casts an obsidian shadow. Oliver was one of many professors trapped in the oxymoronic life of pedantic destitution. Some professors in his situation became homeless. Oliver was \u201cfortunate\u201d enough to only require food stamps, a fact of life for many adjuncts.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s completely insane,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd this isn\u2019t happening just to me. More and more people are doing it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have food stamps,\u201d said the anonymous adjunct from Indiana. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be able to survive without them.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany professors are on food stamps and they go to food donation centers. They donate plasma. And that\u2019s a pretty regular occurrence,\u201d Merklein told Salon.\n\nLife isn\u2019t much easier for those lucky enough to find another income stream. Many are reduced to menial service jobs and other forms of first-world deprivation.\n\n\u201cI ended up applying for a job in a donut shop recently,\u201d said an Ohio professor who requested to go by a pseudonym. Professor Doe taught for over two decades. Many years he only made $9600. Resorting to a food service job was the only way he could afford to live, but it came with more than its expected share of humiliation.\n\n\u201cOne of the managers there is one of the students I had a year ago who was one of the very worst writers I\u2019ve ever had. What are we really saying here? What\u2019s going on in the work world? Something does not seem quite right. I\u2019m not asking to be rich. I\u2019m not asking to be famous. I just want to pay my bills.\u201d\n\nLife became even more harrowing for adjuncts after the Affordable Care Act when universities slashed hours and health insurance coverage became even more difficult to obtain.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re no better off than people who work at Walmart,\u201d said Gordon Haber, a 15-year adjunct professor and author of \u201cAdjunctivitis.\u201d\n\nPerhaps not surprisingly, other professors echoed this sentiment.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s this idea that faculty are cheap, renewable labor. There\u2019s the idea that student are customers or clients,\u201d said Joseph Fruscione, a former adjunct of 15 years. \u201cAnd there are some cases where if a student is displeased with a grade, there\u2019s the notion where they\u2019re paying for this, so they deserve an A or a B because of all this tuition.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Forget minimum wage, some adjunct professors say they're making 50 cents an hour.
