Provided\n\nIn a coincidence of sorts, three of the 188 people from 20 countries who completed the 16th annual Antarctica Marathon earlier this month hail from the Charleston area.\n\nNurse practitioner Catherine Sullivan Rubinstein, attorney Eric Bradshaw and pulmonologist Dr. Lynn Schnapp finished the marathon, which involves even greater marathons getting to and from the event itself.\n\nRubinstein, 46, of Charleston, says getting to the event involved 18 hours of flights to Argentina and then a days-long boat journey across the rough waters of the Drake Passage to King George Island at the tip of Antarctica. That journey took two days to get there and three days to return as the boat made its ways through seas with 10- to 25-foot swells.\n\n\u201cI still feel swimmy in my head,\u201d admitted Rubinstein on Wednesday, two days after returning from the trip. \u201cThe ground still feels like it\u2019s moving,\u201d\n\nDue to the extensive, often dangerous travel, the cost of the marathon adventure also is not for the faint of heart \u2014 $10,000 \u2014 according to Rubinstein.\n\nBecause international treaties limit the number of visitors on Antarctica to no more than 100 per day, the event \u2014 which features a marathon and half marathon \u2014 started races on two days, March 9 and March 10.\n\nThat limitation also means those who sign up have to wait two to three years to go.\n\nRubinstein and Bradshaw, who know each other by participating in physical fitness boot camps at the Medical University of South Carolina, thought they would be going in separate years but both were accepted for the 2015 event.\n\nThey didn\u2019t find out about Schnapp going until two weeks before the trip. Both Rubinstein and Schnapp work at MUSC, the former in pediatric cardiac surgery and the latter as the division chief of pulmonary, critical care, allergy and sleep medicine.\n\nRubinstein and Bradshaw ran on March 9 when the course went from snow-covered to snow-melted, as temperatures that climbed to 39 degrees resulted in slush and mud. Schnapp and the other runners on March 10 were met with colder temps and wind gusts up to 32 miles per hour.\n\nSubsequently, their finish times were relatively slow compared to standard marathons. Rubinstein, who qualified for the Boston Marathon with a 3:53:00 finish at last December\u2019s Kiawah Marathon, finished in 5:17:02. Bradshaw completed it in 6:08:13 and Schnapp in 6:26:06.\n\nRubinstein described the terrain and scenery as if she were \u201con another planet.\u201d\n\nBesides the adventure of running in Antarctica, Rubinstein said a highlight for her was seeing an array of wildlife, including four species of whale, three species of penguin and two species of seal. She also gets to cross one more continent off her life goal of visiting all seven.\n\nShe said a quote she read on the boat summed up the adventure in the best way: \u201cIt\u2019s the worst way to have the best time of your life.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Three local residents return from Antarctica Marathon, Sports, \r\nSportsFP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNews, Antarctica Marathon,Catherine Sullivan Rubenstein,Eric Bradshaw,Lynn Schnapp,Medical University of South Carolina", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "In a coincidence of sorts, three of the 188 people from 20 countries who completed the 16th annual Antarctica Marathon earlier this month hail from the Charleston area.", "title": "Three local residents return from Antarctica Marathon", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20150318/150319301/three-local-residents-return-from-antarctica-marathon", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150318/PC20/150319301/AR/0/AR-150319301.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150318/PC20/150319301/AR/0/AR-150319301.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In a coincidence of sorts, three of the 188 people from 20 countries who completed the 16th annual Antarctica Marathon earlier this month hail from the Charleston area.", "title": "Three local residents return from Antarctica Marathon", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@hsprepzone", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150318/PC20/150319301/AR/0/AR-150319301.jpg?201503191718", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 150319301}}, "keywords": "Three local residents return from Antarctica Marathon , Sports, \r\nSportsFP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNews, Antarctica Marathon,Catherine Sullivan Rubenstein,Eric Bradshaw,Lynn Schnapp,Medical University of South Carolina", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-18T17:21:29Z", "modified_time": "2015-03-19T17:18:00Z", "author": "David Quick"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "In a coincidence of sorts, three of the 188 people from 20 countries who completed the 16th annual Antarctica Marathon earlier this month hail from the Charleston area."}, "article_summary": "ProvidedIn a coincidence of sorts, three of the 188 people from 20 countries who completed the 16th annual Antarctica Marathon earlier this month hail from the Charleston area.\nRubinstein, who qualified for the Boston Marathon with a 3:53:00 finish at last December\u2019s Kiawah Marathon, finished in 5:17:02.\nCatherine Sullivan Rubinstein, Lynn Schnapp and Eric Bradshaw returned this week from running the Antarctica Marathon, which involved marathon flights and boat rides just to get to King George Island in the South Shetlands island chain.\nBecause international treaties limit the number of visitors on Antarctica to no more than 100 per day, the event \u2014 which features a marathon and half marathon \u2014 started races on two days, March 9 and March 10.\nNurse practitioner Catherine Sullivan Rubinstein, attorney Eric Bradshaw and pulmonologist Dr. Lynn Schnapp finished the marathon, which involves even greater marathons getting to and from the event itself."}
