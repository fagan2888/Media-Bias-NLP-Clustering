Edward Snowden can rot in Russia — at least as far as former Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano is concerned.

In an interview to be broadcast Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press,’’ she strongly disagreed with The New York Times and Britain’s Guardian newspaper, both of which printed top-secret documents he leaked and now want the United States to welcome him back with open arms.

“I think Snowden has exacted quite a bit of damage and did it in a way that violated the law,’’ said Napolitano, according to the Daily Mail. “From where I sit today, I would not put clemency on the table at all.’’
