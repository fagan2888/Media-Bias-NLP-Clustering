Her article, called \u201cEbola Doc\u2019s Condition Downgraded to \u2018Idiotic\u2019\u201d has about as much theological accuracy as an average Bill Maher monologue, but with much less entertainment value.\n\nShe begins:\n\nI wonder how the Ebola doctor feels now that his humanitarian trip has cost a Christian charity much more than any services he rendered. What was the point? Whatever good Dr. Kent Brantly did in Liberia has now been overwhelmed by the more than $2 million already paid by the Christian charities Samaritan\u2019s Purse and SIM USA just to fly him and his nurse home in separate Gulfstream jets, specially equipped with medical tents, and to care for them at one of America\u2019s premier hospitals. (This trip may be the first real-world demonstration of the economics of Obamacare.) There\u2019s little danger of an Ebola plague breaking loose from the treatment of these two Americans at the Emory University Hospital. But why do we have to deal with this at all? Why did Dr. Brantly have to go to Africa? The very first \u201crisk factor\u201d listed by the Mayo Clinic for Ebola \u2014 an incurable disease with a 90 percent fatality rate \u2014 is: \u201cTravel to Africa.\u201d Can\u2019t anyone serve Christ in America anymore?\n\nThe United States, she helpfully explains, is where he should\u2019ve spent his time. \u201cYour country is like your family. We\u2019re supposed to take care of our own first.\u201d (This is an argument I\u2019ve heard countless times from people critical of our Ethiopian adoption. \u201cDoesn\u2019t America have orphans?\u201d and \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you taking care of our own?\u201d Of course, no one who\u2019s actually adopted through America\u2019s foster care system has ever said this. This comes only from people with a passing, casual dismissal of adoptions.)\n\nCoulter\u2019s article \u2013 believe it or not \u2013 gets worse and takes a turn for the absolutely absurd when she speculates that Brantly went to Africa because he was \u201ctired of fighting the culture war.\u201d Mark Twain famously said, \u201cTo a guy with a hammer, everything looks like a nail.\u201d Perhaps \u201cto a woman with a political column, everything looks like the Democrats did it.\u201d Here, without any knowledge of Brantly or his politics, she writes that Christian doctors are \u201ctired of being called homophobes, racists, sexists and bigots. So they slink off to Third World countries, away from American culture to do good works\u2026\u201d\n\nApparently, Coulter couldn\u2019t be bothered to do any research about Brantly before writing her article. And haven\u2019t Christians been serving overseas well before anyone ever heard of Jerry Falwell?\n\nCoulter goes on to make a statement she probably believes is pragmatism at its best:\n\nIf Dr. Brantly had practiced at Cedars-Sinai hospital in Los Angeles and turned one single Hollywood power-broker to Christ, he would have done more good for the entire world than anything he could accomplish in a century spent in Liberia.\n\nThankfully, we don\u2019t have to read Coulter\u2019s screed to know why Brantly went to Liberia. In this touching sermon my mother-in-law sent me, (armed with only an iPad, my kids\u2019 grandmother is a better researcher than Coulter) Brantly reads prepared notes, his voice full of emotion. He didn\u2019t go to Liberia because of the culture war or to win accolades from Nicholas Kristof in the New York Times.\n\n\u201cLike any good church going kid, I loved seeing pictures of visiting missionaries who gave their reports to the congregation,\u201d he said. He was particularly interested when his uncle Frank Black came and told of his African missions. (My husband David French is also Frank Black\u2019s nephew.)\n\nIn an eerily prescient passage, Brantly openly discussed the hard times he\u2019s faced since deciding to be a medical missionary. He wasn\u2019t ready to be called to certain parts of Africa, but God worked on his heart and confirmed his calling\n\nNothing has gone as I expected. Time and time again, God has shown me through my circumstances that he is sovereign. He\u2019s in control\u2026 I have no doubt, no hesitation that he has called me to be a full time medical missionary. Though I don\u2019t know what the future holds, my heart leaps with excitement and joy to know He has called me.\n\nBrantly, above all, went to Liberia because of this Scripture in 2 Corinthians, which flies in the face of Coulter\u2019s suggestion that he stick to the influential crowd:\n\n\u201cSo from now on we regard no one from a worldly point of view. Though we once regarded Christ in this way, we do so no longer.\u201d\n\nMatt Perman, writing for The Gospel Coalition, elaborates:\n\nGod is a God of grace, and since grace is unmerited favor, it by definition cannot be clearly seen if the primary focus is on helping those who seem most influential\u2026 God serves (and commands us to serve) those who seemingly have nothing to offer, even at great risk. This, in turn, allows us to see those with seeming influence (in Coulter\u2019s example, Hollywood power-brokers) in the right light as well \u2014 namely, as those who in fact do not have anything to offer of their own either, but rather who are just as dependent on God as those visibly in great need and without influence. So God isn\u2019t creating an us vs. them scenario where people of influence don\u2019t matter but those of no influence do, or where people next door don\u2019t matter but those 8,000 miles away do. Rather, he is doing exactly what it takes to make it clear that we are all equally and fully dependent on grace.\n\nCoulter, however, doesn\u2019t seem interested in a deeply theological discussion. She concludes her strange column with these words of admonition to Brantly and those of his ilk:\n\nThey need to buck up, serve their own country\u2026 There may be no reason for panic about the Ebola doctor, but there is reason for annoyance at Christian narcissism.\n\nImagine the hubris it took for Coulter to tap this out into her laptop before publishing the ignorant criticism of a man fighting for his life on behalf of the gospel. I doubt Brantly has grown tired of the culture war, but I sure am tired of Ann Coulter. In fact, if Coulter decides to really strike a blow to \u201cChristian narcissism,\u201d she could easily do so by immediately discontinuing her column.\n\nBut perhaps her diminishing audience will take care of that soon enough.\n\nRead more on the Patheos Faith and Family Channel and follow Nancy on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram!\n\nPhoto Credit: MANDEL NGAN/AFP/Getty Images)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The French Revolution", "description": "Ann Coulter should stick to politics.
