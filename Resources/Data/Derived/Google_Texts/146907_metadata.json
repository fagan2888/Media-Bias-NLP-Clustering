I have had to cancel all blood work and doctor appointments for my hypertension.\u201d\n\nSo Vickie, we forwarded your email to the state Welfare and Supportive Services Division, which handles Medicaid applications. The issue: They couldn\u2019t find your original application. Now, they\u2019re working with you one-on-one to help you and your daughter fill out new paperwork.\n\nThat\u2019s one case solved. But here\u2019s a quick primer on what all Medicaid applicants need to know.\n\nFirst, Vickie\u2019s problem isn\u2019t that unusual. Between electronic glitches that have kept Medicaid applications from making it through Nevada Health Link to confusion about when a consumer is actually enrolled, it\u2019s \u201cvery common\u201d for Medicaid paperwork to get lost in the ether, said Rachelle Church, a welfare division social services manager.\n\nThe exchange pushed through to the welfare division in January a three-month backlog of 17,000 Medicaid applications stuck in the system since October, Church said. For the most part, the technical problem that prevented applications from forwarding is fixed, but some coverage requests still aren\u2019t getting through.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, some who sign up through Nevada Health Link assume they\u2019re enrolled in Medicaid when the website tells them they\u2019re eligible, Church said. That\u2019s not the case. Two additional steps are needed. That\u2019s why Church recommends consumers log back into Nevada Health Link to double-check that their application is complete.\n\nThen there are the sheer numbers the division is dealing with. Exact volume won\u2019t be known until March 15, but Church said caseworkers are fielding eight times more applications for all types of aid each month than they received before October. Employees are working weekends to get through the applications, but it\u2019ll be months before they\u2019re caught up, she said.\n\nTo add to the problem, it\u2019s difficult to reach a live person to check an application\u2019s status, insurance brokers say.\n\nLydia Boske, a broker with Nevada West Business Insurance and president of the Clark County Association of Health Underwriters, said the welfare division was referring questions to Nevada Health Link, which would send them back to the division. Nevada Health Link in November published a list of seven agencies that could help with Medicaid enrollment, but only one could help healthy, childless adults in Las Vegas enroll. It\u2019s in Reno, so walk-ins are difficult.\n\nNor does Nevada Health Link\u2019s call-center message cite Medicaid enrollment as an option for callers. The system does refer to applying for public assistance for food and energy bills, but that\u2019s confusing to consumers listening for Medicaid, Boske said. And forget calling the welfare division. Boske has worked with consumers who report waiting up to three hours to get through, only to have their call dropped because of high phone-in volumes.\n\nHere\u2019s Boske\u2019s advice: If you\u2019re healthy and you\u2019re applying for Medicaid just to have coverage, submit your paperwork and be patient. It\u2019ll take a while, but your cards will come eventually. If you end up needing care, you\u2019re good, because Medicaid will pay for care as far back as 90 days before your application date.\n\nIf you\u2019re ill and you need care now, visit the welfare division\u2019s offices at 611 N. Nellis Blvd. or at 2505 Chandler Ave. You may have to wait half a day to see a caseworker, but if you qualify you can leave the office with Medicaid card in hand.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is, we\u2019re all trying to help consumers navigate this system,\u201d said Boske, who makes no commission for helping Medicaid enrollees. \u201cLet\u2019s fix this before it becomes a public outcry, and I believe it will. We have people who have enrolled who are trying to fill prescriptions, but they never got their cards.\u201d\n\n\u25a0 Back on the exchange, Gary (last name withheld) thinks his subsidy as calculated by Nevada Health Link is a little off: \u201cAccording to the website, I am eligible for a $150 subsidy toward health insurance. Even given this subsidy, the least-costly plan will still cost $275. I was told by a representative whatever the website said is what the subsidy will be. This $150 subsidy does not seem right to me. Can you help?\u201d\n\nWe ran your details through a couple of subsidy calculators, Gary, and we don\u2019t think your subsidy sounds right, either.\n\nBased on the personal information you gave us \u2014 62 and single, make $15,996 a year, have never smoked and live in Clark County \u2014 it looks as if you should be paying a lot less. Subsidy calculators at the Kaiser Family Foundation and ValuePenguin.com each say your cheapest plan should cost you less than $50 a month.\n\nValuePenguin.com quoted a MyHPN Silver 4 plan at a monthly premium of $42.25. That\u2019s with a $533.09 premium, and a $490.83 subsidy. The most you should pay for a silver plan would be $200.12, and that would be for Blue Cross and Blue Shield\u2019s Silver Direct Access, which has a monthly premium of $690.96 and a subsidy of $490.83.\n\nKaiser\u2019s calculator said your annual presubsidy premium would be $6,429, but that your tax credit should cover 92 percent of the cost, or $5,891. That would leave you on the hook for $539 a year, or about $45 per month.\n\nWe ran your situation by CJ Bawden, a spokesman for the Silver State Health Insurance Exchange. His first question was whether you receive nontaxable Social Security income. If you do, that income is added back into your modified adjusted gross income calculation, and could affect your subsidy. If that\u2019s not the case, Gary, try logging back into your account and submitting a new application. You may have made a typing error or entered a deduction incorrectly.\n\nFor a second opinion, plus some help redoing your application, reach out to a navigator firm or an insurance broker.
