I've complimented you plenty of times.\" It made me think about how rare it is for a man to openly express a desire to be praised for his looks and question why I didn't compliment men on their looks more often. When I Googled, \"men given compliments on appearance,\" Google suggested I try, \"Men give compliments on appearance.\" The concept of women complimenting men on their appearance can still seem foreign. Men are often portrayed as using compliments as a social tool, but do they themselves want to be applauded for their physical attributes? Compliments from women are met with a response type other than acceptance: as a threat. In wanting to be praised for his looks, it would appear my date falls into a minority, according to one 1990 study by researchers at SUNY Binghamton and the University of the Witwatersrand, which concluded that compliments from men were generally accepted, especially by female recipients, but \"compliments from women are met with a response type other than acceptance\": as a threat. Men often see compliments as \"face-threatening acts,\" or acts intended to embarrass or patronize, the study authors found. What was meant as a nicety could be seen as a way to assert control.\n\nWhen it comes to compliments from their own sex, men often regard appearance-based praise as a come-on. In her 2003 book, Sociolinguistics: The Essential Readings, Christina Bratt Paulston writes that for heterosexual men, \"to compliment another man on his hair, his clothes, or his body is an extremely face-threatening thing to do, both for the speaker and the hearer.\" In the book The Psychology of Love, Michele Antoinette Paludi points out that stepping outside of gender roles can reduce attraction between partners. \"Current research indicates that gender-atypical qualities are often turn-offs in intimate relationships \u2026 Women also experienced social costs for atypical gender behavior \u2026 both men who were passive and women who were assertive were evaluated as significantly less socially attractive by men than women who did not engage in self-promoting behaviors.\" Being the arbiter of someone's attractiveness can be interpreted as an expression of masculinity that women are not traditionally expected to adopt. Further, it is possible that a good portion of men don\u2019t want to be essentially \"treated like women,\" as their masculinity is dependent on being above the judgments women are often subjected to. Men are also more reluctant to express behaviors such as envy, according to the 2012 book, Gender, Culture and Consumer Behavior, which suggests that men hesitate to display \u201clow-agency\u201d emotions such as anxiety, vulnerability and jealousy. Women felt the need to be cautious when complimenting men because they didn't want to be \"too forward\" or attract \"unwanted attention.\" In life as well as in art, a man\u2019s focus on his own appearance can be perceived as detracting from his perceived masculinity in the eyes of male reviewers. In her book, Extra-Ordinary Men: White Heterosexual Masculinity in Contemporary Popular Cinema, Nicola Rehling points out that in the movie Gladiator, Maximus had a muscular build but was not sexualized on-screen. In the movie Troy, meanwhile, Brad Pitt\u2019s Achilles was practically groomed for the enjoyment of straight female and gay male viewers. Crowe's body was not nearly as exposed as Pitt's was throughout the movie.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Being the arbiter of someone&#39;s attractiveness can be interpreted as an expression of masculinity that women are not traditionally expected to adopt.", "author": "Casey Quinlan", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "Being the arbiter of someone&#39;s attractiveness can be interpreted as an expression of masculinity that women are not traditionally expected to adopt.", "title": "Why Men Can't Take Compliments", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2013/12/dandytoy_banner/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/12/why-men-cant-take-compliments/282164/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc97f5\"", "article_summary": "When I Googled, \"men given compliments on appearance,\" Google suggested I try, \"Men give compliments on appearance.\"\nMen often see compliments as \"face-threatening acts,\" or acts intended to embarrass or patronize, the study authors found.\nWhen it comes to compliments from their own sex, men often regard appearance-based praise as a come-on.\nMen are often portrayed as using compliments as a social tool, but do they themselves want to be applauded for their physical attributes?\nMen are also more reluctant to express behaviors such as envy, according to the 2012 book, Gender, Culture and Consumer Behavior, which suggests that men hesitate to display \u201clow-agency\u201d emotions such as anxiety, vulnerability and jealousy."}
