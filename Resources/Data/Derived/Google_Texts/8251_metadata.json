The story was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.\n\n\u201cI come from the tech industry,\u201d Musk said. \u201cWhat we did in the tech business involved incredible mentoring. Angel investors help entrepreneurs and guide them. There is a lot of sharing of ideas. We\u2019re not opposed to Wolfgang sharing ideas, but his taking the brand is really sad.\u201d\n\nThe Kitchen, since its founding more than a decade ago, has opened eight locations up and down Colorado\u2019s Front Range, including its formal restaurants and its less formal venues known as Next Door. It also has a restaurant in Chicago.\n\nPuck could not be reached for comment.\n\nLast year, Musk also challenged a Loveland restaurant that had opened with the name Next Door, but the dispute was settled when the restaurant owner agreed to change the name of his establishment.\n\nMusk said in discussions with Puck company officials, The Kitchen team proposed several variations on the name, but with no success.\n\n\u201cThis is a wholesale leveraging of the hard work we\u2019ve done to build our brand,\u201d Musk said. \u201cWe really are doing good things. And he\u2019s trying to create confusion in the market.\u201d\n\nMusk, who has trademarked several versions of the name, said the issue will move beyond the U.S. Patent Office if it is not resolved soon.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s at the dispute level right now,\u201d Musk said. \u201cBut this will go to court if he doesn\u2019t change his name.\u201d\n\nBoulder trademark attorney Chris Archer said protecting a name as common as \u201cthe kitchen\u201d could be difficult.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t stop people from using a term in its descriptive sense,\u201d Archer said. \u201cYou can stop them if you\u2019ve developed a secondary meaning.\u201d\n\nThe Kitchen, through its holding company Kitchen Cafe LLC, has been adding eateries at a moderate pace. A year ago it raised more than $9.5 million in an equity round, after raising $6.17 million in 2014, according to SEC filings.\n\nIn 2014, Musk and his partners were named winners of the Rocky Mountain Sustainer Award as part of the Chefs Collaborative annual Sustainable Food Summit.\n\nPuck and Musk haven\u2019t competed head-to-head yet, although Puck once operated Wolfgang Puck Grand Cafe at the Denver Pavilions on the 16th Street Mall. That restaurant closed in 2005. Puck continues to operate the Wolfgang Puck Express eatery at Denver International Airport.\n\nKimbal Musk is the brother of Elon Musk, a founder of aerospace firm SpaceX and electric carmaker Tesla Motors.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Boulder restaurant The Kitchen battles Wolfgang Puck over name", "title": "Boulder restaurant The Kitchen battles Wolfgang Puck over name", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/02/14/boulder-restaurant-the-kitchen-battles-wolfgang-puck-over-name/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160214__20160215_A4_CD15BOULDERRESTAURANTp1.jpg", "height": 429}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160214__20160215_A4_CD15BOULDERRESTAURANTp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-14T19:08:49+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-18T03:17:35+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Denver restaurants"}, "article_summary": "Puck continues to operate the Wolfgang Puck Express eatery at Denver International Airport.\nBOULDER \u2014 The Kitchen, Boulder\u2019s hallmark Pearl Street restaurant that specializes in locally sourced fare, is challenging Wolfgang Puck over Puck\u2019s use of the same name.\nPuck and Musk haven\u2019t competed head-to-head yet, although Puck once operated Wolfgang Puck Grand Cafe at the Denver Pavilions on the 16th Street Mall.\n\u201cYou can stop them if you\u2019ve developed a secondary meaning.\u201dThe Kitchen, through its holding company Kitchen Cafe LLC, has been adding eateries at a moderate pace.\nMusk said in discussions with Puck company officials, The Kitchen team proposed several variations on the name, but with no success."}
