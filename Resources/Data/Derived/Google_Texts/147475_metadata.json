They play on an island, left vulnerable to explosive passes in a game in which rules favor the offense. No confidence, no chance.\n\nJust as important as mental toughness is selective amnesia.\n\nThe Broncos\u2019 Aqib Talib delivered a streaky performance Sunday, but when it mattered most, the crowd alive with a final burst of optimism, he crushed its dreams with an interception of a pass by Geno Smith, returning it 22 yards for a touchdown with 15 seconds left.\n\n\u201cWe were in a cover two. We knew he had to get the ball out of his hands quickly,\u201d Talib said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we called a play where we all had our eyes on the quarterback.\u201d\n\nTalib read Smith\u2019s intentions, jumping the route on a pass intended for Jeremy Kerley. Talib didn\u2019t require formal introductions from the end zone. This marked Talib\u2019s fifth interception return for a touchdown since 2009, second most in the NFL during this stretch, one behind the Chicago Bears\u2019 Charles Tillman.\n\n\u201cIt just wasn\u2019t a good enough ball,\u201d said Smith, who finished 23-of-43 for 190 yards. He was forced to throw often as the Broncos held the Jets to 31 yards rushing.\n\n\u201cObviously, they were playing sidelines,\u201d said Smith. \u201cI tried to get the ball there, and I didn\u2019t give Jeremy a good enough ball.\u201d\n\nThe Broncos focused on takeaways last week. They entered the game with three this season, creating chatter about punch-causing fumbles and securing errant passes. Talib\u2019s interception represents a potential lit fuse.\n\n\u201cTurnovers, man, they come in bunches,\u201d Talib said. \u201cHopefully that will be the spark that gets us going.\u201d\n\nTalib kept the ball. Sort of. He handed it to his fianc\u00e9e in the stands.\n\nPHOTOS: Denver Broncos vs. New York Jets\n\n\u201cI have the ones from my touchdowns, but I think my nephews throw them around in the yard,\u201d Talib said. \u201cBut you gotta get them.\u201d\n\nNothing came easily for Talib. He missed a chunk of the second half with cramping in his calves because of dehydration. He also surrendered a touchdown pass to erstwhile Bronco Eric Decker, who returned Sunday after he missed last week with a leg injury.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Broncos\u2019 Aqib Talib seals win over New York Jets with pick six", "title": "Broncos\u2019 Aqib Talib seals win over New York Jets with pick six", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/10/12/broncos-aqib-talib-seals-win-over-new-york-jets-with-pick-six/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141012__talibp1.jpg", "height": 463}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141012__talibp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-10-12T17:48:31+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T22:23:25+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "He also surrendered a touchdown pass to erstwhile Bronco Eric Decker, who returned Sunday after he missed last week with a leg injury.\nPHOTOS: Denver Broncos vs. New York Jets\u201cI have the ones from my touchdowns, but I think my nephews throw them around in the yard,\u201d Talib said.\nHe was forced to throw often as the Broncos held the Jets to 31 yards rushing.\n\u201cI tried to get the ball there, and I didn\u2019t give Jeremy a good enough ball.\u201dThe Broncos focused on takeaways last week.\n\u201cIt just wasn\u2019t a good enough ball,\u201d said Smith, who finished 23-of-43 for 190 yards."}
