Some of the deaths resulted from faulty or nonexistent personal protective equipment (PPE)\u2014gloves, masks and other barriers used to block Ebola transmission. Yet more recent cases in well-equipped U.S. hospitals and in Spain have uncovered a broader PPE-related problem: the guidelines for how to use the gear were insufficient.\n\nTwo workers who tended to Liberian patient Thomas Eric Duncan in a Dallas hospital before his death last month tested positive for Ebola despite their use of protective gear. Meanwhile, the Spanish nurse\u2019s aide who tested positive after treating patients in Madrid is thought to have become infected with the Ebola virus after touching her face with a glove while removing her protective gear. She was released from the hospital on Wednesday after a month-long battle with the disease and was the first person known to have contracted the Ebola virus outside Africa.\n\nIn the past few weeks both the World Health Organization and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have updated their PPE guidelines. In addition to encouraging health care workers to better cover their mucous membranes and skin when treating Ebola patients, the CDC in particular is advising greater caution and a strict adherence to the buddy system when removing coveralls and gloves potentially exposed to the virus.\n\nThe WHO has for the first time developed and released, on October 31, formal guidelines for choosing facial protection, gloves and other PPE when caring for Ebola patients and others infected with viruses in the same family (filoviruses). The WHO\u2019s foremost recommendation is that all health workers completely cover the mucous membranes of their eyes, mouth and nose to guard against contaminated droplets and fluids. More specifically, the agency strongly recommends the use of either a face shield or goggles as well as a fluid-resistant medical mask with a structured design that does not collapse against the mouth. Health care workers should also wear a fluid-resistant, particulate-filtering respirator during procedures that generate aerosols of body fluids.\n\nIn addition, the WHO advises wearing two nitrile gloves\u2014as opposed to less reliable latex\u2014on each hand when working with Ebola patients. The agency discourages the use of three or more gloves per hand because this can interfere with a health care worker\u2019s manual dexterity. The new guidelines also reiterate the WHO\u2019s earlier recommendations that gowns, aprons and other coverings be disposable and disposed of properly\u2014which means they should be incinerated or sterilized. Reusable equipment such as boots should be disinfected with a chlorine solution.\n\nThe revised WHO guidelines are the direct result of efforts to combat and contain what has become by far the biggest outbreak of hemorrhagic fever ever, says Edward Kelley, director of WHO Service Delivery and Safety.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The WHO and the CDC have revised guidelines on use of personal protective equipment, but concerns persist", "author": "Larry Greenemeier", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The WHO and the CDC have revised guidelines on use of personal protective equipment, but concerns persist", "title": "Ebola outbreak prompts new safety protocols for healthcare workers", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/11/09/ebola_outbreak_prompts_new_safety_protocols_for_health_care_workers_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/ebola2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The WHO and the CDC have revised guidelines on use of personal protective equipment, but concerns persist", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/ebola2.jpg", "title": "Ebola outbreak prompts new safety protocols for healthcare workers", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Ebola outbreak prompts new safety protocols for healthcare workers", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, cdC, Center for Disease Control, ebola, Scientific American, The Scientific American, WHO, World Health Organization", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0e70\"", "article_summary": "Health care workers should also wear a fluid-resistant, particulate-filtering respirator during procedures that generate aerosols of body fluids.\nIn addition, the WHO advises wearing two nitrile gloves\u2014as opposed to less reliable latex\u2014on each hand when working with Ebola patients.\nThe agency discourages the use of three or more gloves per hand because this can interfere with a health care worker\u2019s manual dexterity.\nThe WHO\u2019s foremost recommendation is that all health workers completely cover the mucous membranes of their eyes, mouth and nose to guard against contaminated droplets and fluids.\nTwo workers who tended to Liberian patient Thomas Eric Duncan in a Dallas hospital before his death last month tested positive for Ebola despite their use of protective gear."}
