The Affordable Care Act (ACA) is forcing the industry to focus on better clinical pathways, including ways to integrate clinical content such as the Picture Archiving and Communications System (PACS) and imaging archives from disparate facilities or clinics into the EHR.\n\nThis is not a trivial matter: billions of medical images are captured in the U.S. each year, and clinicians need speedy access to the images from current and older studies. A lack of integration among PACS or imaging archives can make it difficult or impossible to access that data. As a result, providers may order redundant studies or, worse, make medical decisions without adequate information.\n\nAttend this webinar and:\n\nHear from leading healthcare executives as they discuss the key elements of post-merger enterprise imaging strategies, along with the advantages and drawbacks of each.\n\nLearn the technical and cultural challenges that exist and understand how to integrate legacy PACS after a merger of hospitals or clinics\n\nThe iHT2 research report will be released Wednesday, Mar. 21, 2016 and will feature 13 Things You Need to Know About Enterprise Imaging Strategies for M&As. All webinar registrants will receive an advanced copy of the report.", "article_metadata": {"com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages04.net,assistedhousingfinancialinsider.com,assistedhousinginsider.com,commercialleaselawinsider.com,constructionsuperconference.com,efaconference.com,secure.rhq.com,secure2.rhq.com,www.addictionpro.com,www.apartmentlawinsider.com,www.assistedhousinginsider.com,www.behavioral.net,www.commercialleaselawinsider.com,www.commercialtenantsleaseinsider.com,www.communityassociationinsider.com,www.constructionsuperconference.com,www.entjournal.com,www.environmentsforaging.com,www.etouches.com,www.fairhousingcoach.com,www.hcd11.com,www.healthcare-informatics.com,www.healthcarebuildingideas.com,www.healthcaredesignmagazine.com,www.herdjournal.com,www.ihealthtran.com,www.landlordvtenant.com,www.ltlmagazine.com,www.nycapartmentlaw.com,www.taxcredithousinginsider.com,www.vendomegrp.com,www.vendomerealestatemedia.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "com.silverpop.cothost": "engage4.silverpop.com"}, "article_summary": "21, 2016 and will feature 13 Things You Need to Know About Enterprise Imaging Strategies for M&As.\nAttend this webinar and:Hear from leading healthcare executives as they discuss the key elements of post-merger enterprise imaging strategies, along with the advantages and drawbacks of each.\nA lack of integration among PACS or imaging archives can make it difficult or impossible to access that data.\nWith hospital mergers on the upswing healthcare executives and IT managers must grapple with the manifold challenges of integrating or replacing various clinical systems.\nLearn the technical and cultural challenges that exist and understand how to integrate legacy PACS after a merger of hospitals or clinicsThe iHT2 research report will be released Wednesday, Mar."}
