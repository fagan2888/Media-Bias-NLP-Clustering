The Canadian dollar hit a 9-1/2-month high against the greenback of C$1.2590.\n\nAnalysts said those commodity currencies benefited from a rebound in oil prices and growing reassurance about China's economic situation following strong data from the world's second-biggest economy in recent weeks.\n\nThe dollar hit a two-week high against the safe-haven yen of 109.88 yen. The dollar also rallied more than 1 percent against the Swiss franc, another currency often viewed as a safe haven, to a more than three-week high of 0.9733 franc.\n\n\"You have concerns about China much lower than they were,\" said Shahab Jalinoos, global head of FX strategy at Credit Suisse in New York.\n\nJalinoos also said higher U.S. government bond yields, compared to European and Japanese yields, contributed to the dollar's gains against the yen and euro. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yields hit a three-week high of 1.859 percent.\n\nThe dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, was last up 0.57 percent at 94.509.\n\nUnderscoring the greater risk appetite, the benchmark U.S. S&P 500 stock index was last up 0.32 percent.\n\n(Reporting by Sam Forgione; Editing by Nick Zieminski and Meredith Mazzilli)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S.", "title": "Dollar gains against euro ahead of ECB meeting", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/19/Yen-defensive-commodity-currencies-shine", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/global-forex_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/19/Yen-defensive-commodity-currencies-shine", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/global-forex_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "The euro eased from a one-week high against the dollar of $1.1386 touched earlier in the session and was last down 0.55 percent at $1.1293 ahead of the ECB meeting.\nThe dollar hit a two-week high against the safe-haven yen of 109.88 yen.\nThe Canadian dollar hit a 9-1/2-month high against the greenback of C$1.2590.\nJalinoos also said higher U.S. government bond yields, compared to European and Japanese yields, contributed to the dollar's gains against the yen and euro.\nBenchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yields hit a three-week high of 1.859 percent."}
