The lone winning ticket for Thursday night’s Pick 6 drawing — the largest of the year at $12.8 million — was sold in Secaucus, state lottery officials said yesterday.

The winning numbers were 8, 14, 17, 31, 36 and 40.

The $12.8 million ticket was purchased at the Faber News & Gift shop in the Secaucus Junction train station. Store manager Mohammad Ansari was stunned when he heard his store had sold the winning ticket.

It’s the second time the store has scored a major win in the 10 years it has been open, Ansari said.

With trains heading in all directions from the station, the winner could be from anywhere in the tri-state area, Ansari said.

With news of the winning ticket’s origin getting around, the store sold $1,000 in lottery tickets by 11 a.m., supervisor Anwar Bakth said.

“It is a great pleasure that the lucky one came to us,” Bakth said.

A total of 894,061 tickets — at $1 apiece — were sold for Thursday’s drawing, New Jersey Lottery Executive Director Carole Hedinger said in a news release.

In addition to the jackpot winner, 11 people won $4,063 for matching five numbers, 781 people won $62 for matching four numbers and 15,097 people won $3 for matching three numbers.

The next Pick 6 drawing, which can be watched live on njlottery.net, will be held on Monday with a starting jackpot of $2 million.
