But doing that hasn\u2019t been simple.\n\nHenricksen joined the Child and Adolescent Clinic in Longview, Washington, nine months ago, soon after he completed his residency in Seattle. He had planned to work in global health, but in medical school, he met a pediatrician in rural Georgia who changed his career decision.\n\n\u201cHe was addressing a lot of these chronic health issues in terms of obesity, in terms of smoking, in terms of diabetes, in terms of mental health decisions that really impact an adult health in large ways,\" Henricksen, 33, said, \"but he was dealing with them 20 years before they became big adult health problems.\"\n\nIn the South, Henricksen saw firsthand that poor communities in America needed more doctors, so he decided to become a rural pediatrician, hoping to make a difference for kids early in their lives before they developed bad habits.\n\nRural communities have often struggled with not having enough medical providers. The Affordable Care Act allowed more people to enroll in Medicaid, the health program for low-income families. Doctors who saw those patients received a temporary pay bump.\n\nHenricksen\u2019s clinic used the money to hire two new doctors; he was one of them. He headed to southwest Washington with his young family and strong ideals. \u201cBoth my wife and I wanted to go and live somewhere where we felt like we were doing work that actually felt meaningful,\u201d he said.\n\nThe feds picked up 100 percent of the Medicaid tab for two years \u2013 but Congress didn\u2019t renew that subsidy. Now it\u2019s up to the states to decide whether to continue. Washington was one of 30 states that expanded Medicaid under Obamacare.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been scrappy. We\u2019ve been able to find extra funding sources, find extra grants,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m also really concerned that it\u2019s going to get harder, that it makes our job a lot harder to do.\u201d\n\nOn a recent Monday, Henricksen started the morning with a 2-year-old boy who had a bleeding cut on his head. He checked the wound.\n\n\u201cI really think it\u2019s a bad scrape and nothing that really needs to be sutured up,\u201d Henricksen told mom Vanessa Gavino. He tried to patch the wound with a kind of super glue.\n\nThe next patient is Lysa Coleman, 20.\n\nShe\u2019s at the clinic for a follow-up. A few months ago she started treatment for ADD because she was struggling with school.\n\n\u201cAny weird moodiness or emotional changes?\u201d Henricksen asked her.\n\n\u201cSort of,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve had a couple of days where I just want to break down and cry and freak out. But I\u2019ve kept it cool.\u201d\n\nThere have been disruptions at home. Her sister is visiting with her babies, and sleep has been tough for Coleman \u2013 she\u2019s had to sleep on the floor. On top of that, her boyfriend just moved to Seattle. And then there\u2019s school.\n\n\u201cThis is pretty normal for me,\u201d she said. \u201cLike when everything kind of gets stressful, I try to find an escape, but I can never escape.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you trying to escape from?\u201d Henricksen asked.\n\n\u201cMy family,\u201d she said. \u201cBut they can always find me.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s trying to get her degree: \u201cAnd then I\u2019m going to leave as fast as I can.\u201d\n\nHenricksen suggested she see a counselor. He asked her to come back in two months.\n\nUncertain future\n\nHow long the Longview clinic could continue accepting Medicaid patients is uncertain. About 73 percent of the clinic\u2019s patients are on Medicaid.\n\nWashington Gov. Jay Inslee asked the state to pay the Medicaid bill in his budget proposal, but it hasn\u2019t gone anywhere. That\u2019s making doctors in rural areas nervous about their ability to continue seeing poor patients. Henricksen hopes the state Legislature will have a change of heart, but he said if not, the clinic will have to come up with a backup plan.\n\nElsewhere, providers are already dropping Medicaid patients. Henricksen\u2019s clinic has seen a recent surge of new patients from nearby Centralia and Vancouver, Washington. Many have driven more than an hour to his clinic because it doesn\u2019t turn away patients based on their health plan.\n\nHenricksen said he still would have come to Longview even if he had known of the financial uncertainty.\n\n\u201cBut there are other doctors in the state that aren\u2019t making that same decision,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"category": "News", "description": "As a new doctor, Wes Henricksen wanted to help poor communities.
