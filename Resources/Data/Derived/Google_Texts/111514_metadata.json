On July 19, the Myrtle Beach Pelicans sent out a tweet in which Milovich agreed to a challenge from his staff to have an in-game prostate exam if Emery\u2019s \u201cFierce Fallon\u201d Facebook page received 10,000 likes by Thursday, July 24:\n\n\u2018Like\u2019 http://t.co/8SqENhoPVz today & help us hit 10K \u2018Likes\u2019 before noon Thursday (7/24)! @ARMilovich #FierceFallon pic.twitter.com/PYwsyv3Ajr \u2014 MyrtleBeachPelicans (@Pelicanbaseball) July 19, 2014\n\nThe announcement was shared on Twitter by ESPN\u2019s Sports Business Reporter, Darren Rovell the next day. By Monday, Fallon\u2019s Facebook Page had reached the 10,000 like mark. Milovich said during a WRNN Hot Talk radio intervew, \u201cOne Darren Rovell tweet later and here we are.\u201d He kept his promise, and the prostate exam took place during the seventh inning stretch of the Pelican\u2019s home game at Myrtle Beach\u2019s TicketReturn.com Field.\n\nIn a slightly humorous tribute to the GM\u2019s act, the team also passed out 1000 foam fingers with blue ribbons on them to the adult men in the stadium to promote prostate cancer awareness.\n\nIf \u2018taking one for the team\u2019 keeps one child from going fatherless,\u201d Milovich said, \u201cthen it will be worth it.\u201d\n\nThe Myrtle Beach Pelicans\u2019 GM took his first prostate exam in good humor, telling ESPN, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t bad. The doc was done maybe 15 seconds into the song. I think my next exam is going to be a significant letdown.\u201d He was also suprised with the response to his public exam. \u201cThe amount of people, who are either prostate-cancer survivors or people who have lost family members to prostate cancer, who have said what tonight meant to them has been overwhelming, \u201d he said.\n\nEmery Fallon, who was too ill to attend the game, watched the performance from home on a laptop. Her mother, Melanie, expressed gratitude for the Myrtle Beach team\u2019s support, saying, \u201cShe had a rough week with fever and viruses, so the fact that this happened was really a godsend.\u201d\n\nAs for his singing, Milovich told ESPN that he though he needed voice lessons.
