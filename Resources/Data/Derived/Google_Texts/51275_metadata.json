Physician partnership: Doctors are now less dependent on hospitals for capital, patients and revenue, and many physicians are more tech savvy than ever before. Use that knowledge when building a physician-partnership model for the future, he suggested. Clinical innovation: Figure out which new technologies will suit the hospital best but consider the ones that are most helpful to the community's health as well as the hospital's budget. \"In all likelihood, clinical partnerships will be necessary to sustain state-of-the-art services,\" Keckley wrote. Consumerism and retail health: This is a vital area of growth for all hospitals, he said. Patients want to control their own health and are open to group visits, personalized online tools and electronic authorization for script fulfillment, according to Keckley. They want transparency and easy access. Alternative capital: Explore the \"full range of options in accessing capital and be more strategic in managing return on capital in deploying assets,\" Keckley wrote. Understand the implication of the organization's capital expenditure commitments and be prepared to justify investment decisions.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nCEO compensation: Boards must protect hospital interests\n\nDoctors on boards improve hospital performance\n\nTake strategic planning back to basics\n\nStudy: Hospital boards need more focus on quality of care", "article_metadata": {"description": "During a time of funding cuts, regulatory constraints and changing care models,\u00a0hospital boards\u00a0must work together with CEOs to \"assure the solvency and sustainability of their hospital,\"\u00a0according to\u00a0a piece by Paul Keckley in\u00a0Hospitals & Health Networks.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "During a time of funding cuts, regulatory constraints and changing care models,\u00a0hospital boards\u00a0must work together with CEOs to \"assure the solvency and sustainability of their hospital,\"\u00a0according to\u00a0a piece by Paul Keckley in\u00a0Hospitals & Health Networks.", "title": "5 issues all hospital boards must tackle", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/5-issues-all-hospital-boards-must-tackle/2014-06-04", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Care Delivery,evidence-based care,hospital boards,Hospitals & Health Networks Daily,HR & Workforce Management,Innovation,Operations & Business Management,Paul Keckley,retail health,unnecessary procedures", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,HR & Workforce Management,Operations & Business Management"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd76a\"", "article_summary": "To learn more:- here's the articleRelated Articles:CEO compensation: Boards must protect hospital interestsDoctors on boards improve hospital performanceTake strategic planning back to basicsStudy: Hospital boards need more focus on quality of care\nKeckley, a leading health economist and managing director of the Navigant Center for Healthcare Research and Policy Analysis, said hospital boards must understand emergent issues to better prepare themselves for the evolving industry.\nDuring a time of funding cuts, regulatory constraints and changing care models, hospital boards must work together with CEOs to \"assure the solvency and sustainability of their hospital,\" according to a piece by Paul Keckley in Hospitals & Health Networks.\n\"In all likelihood, clinical partnerships will be necessary to sustain state-of-the-art services,\" Keckley wrote.\nAlternative capital: Explore the \"full range of options in accessing capital and be more strategic in managing return on capital in deploying assets,\" Keckley wrote."}
