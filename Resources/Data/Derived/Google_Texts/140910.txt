COEUR d’ALENE — Republican Paul Amador will seek election to House Seat 4B.

That position is now held by Rep. Kathy Sims, also a Republican.

“Running a campaign based on the pillars of education, economy, and health care, Paul believes he can make a difference in his community and his state — working for the people that he will represent,” stated the press release announcing his candidacy.

“I come from a family that recognizes honest American values, where parents, aunts, uncles, and grandparents teach you about honesty and humility, where we learn by doing and trying, and where hard work is expected and rewarded,” Amador said in the release, adding that he wants “all voices to be heard.”

Amador is looking forward to meeting the public at town hall meetings and debates, as well as connecting with his supporters and sharing his ideas for a better future for Idaho.

He will formally announce his candidacy for House Seat 4B, at 2 p.m. today at The Art Spirit Gallery, 415 E. Sherman Ave., Coeur d’Alene.
