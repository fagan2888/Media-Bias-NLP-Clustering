Rubio's support for the legislation comes as the issue has gained prominence in the 2016 presidential election particularly in New Hampshire, which has its primary on Tuesday. The Florida senator took third place in the Iowa caucuses and has been hoping for at least a second-place showing in the early-voting state.

The Senate Judiciary Committee is expected to mark up the Portman-Whitehouse bill Thursday.
