(AP Photo/Ben Margot)\n\n(CNSNews.com) - In an event held at a private home in Los Angeles on Saturday, President Barack Obama said that America must make a \u201cfundamental decision\u201d about its values.\n\nThe president went on to cite as an example of what he meant the Supreme Court\u2019s decision declaring same-sex marriage a \u201cright\u201d--which he described as \"one of the proudest things that we've been able to achieve during the course of my presidency.\"\n\nObama also said America\u2019s greatness would be measured by how we treat \"the vulnerable and the infirm and our aged.\"\n\nThe president favors legalized abortion of unborn babies up to the moment of birth and as a state senator in Illinois opposed legislation that would have defined a born baby who survived an abortion as a \u201cperson,\u201d \u201chuman being,\u201d \u201cchild\u201d and \u201cindividual\u201d under Illinois law.\n\nMore recently Obama threatened to veto legislation to fund the federal government\u2014and thus shut the government down\u2014if the legislation included language that prohibited federal funds from going to Planned Parenthood. Planned Parenthood, which harvests tissue from aborted babies, said in its most recent annual report that it aborted 327,653 babies in fiscal 2013 and that it got $528.4 million in \u201cgovernment health services grants and reimbursements\u201d in the year that ended on June 30, 2014.\n\nThe Obama administration is also preparing to take the Little Sisters of the Poor to the Supreme Court because the Little Sisters will not participate in the implemenation of an Obamacare regulation that requires virtually all health-care plans to cover sterilizations, contraceptives, and abortion-inducing drugs and devices. The Little Sisters, an order of Catholic nuns that operates nursing homes for the elderly poor, have argued repeatedly in federal court that it would violate their Catholic faith to obey the administration's sterilization-contraception-abortiacient regulation.\n\nWhen Pope Francis was in Washington, D.C. last month he visited one of the Little Sister's nursing homes to show solidarity with them in their fight to preserve their religious freedom.\n\nObama said at the Saturday event: \u201cBut part of it also has to do with the fact that there is a fundamental decision we have to make as a country in terms of our values--what do we believe, what do we care about.\"\n\n\u201cI believe that this country works best not when we're only thinking about ourselves but when we're thinking about others,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI believe that America is best when we treat everybody with fairness and respect, not just on the basis of whether it's making sure that we're not discriminating because of race or gender, but also that we're not discriminating against somebody because of who they love,\u201d Obama said. \u201cAnd one of the proudest things that we've been able to achieve during the course of my presidency is marriage equality is now the law in all 50 states. Not just one or two or three or five, but everywhere.\u201d\n\nObama lauded the people at the fundraiser for their commitment to \u201cjustice.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo the reason you're here is because you believe that everybody should have a fair shot,\u201d said Obama. \u201cYou believe in justice; you believe in equality; you believe in opportunity; you believe in diplomacy. You believe that America\u2019s greatness is measured not just by our skyscrapers and our GDP and how many billionaires we have, but also how do we treat the vulnerable and the infirm and our aged, and our poor and our hungry.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "CNS News", "description": "*/", "title": "Obama: \u2018There is a Fundamental Decision We Have to Make as a Country in Terms of Our Values\u2019", "url": "http://cnsnews.com/news/article/terence-p-jeffrey/obama-there-fundamental-decision-we-have-make-country-terms-our", "image": "//cdn.cnsnews.com/obama-baby-ap_photo.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-10-13T11:31:14-04:00", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-13T11:08:46-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-13T11:31:14-04:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "*/", "title": "Obama: \u2018There is a Fundamental Decision We Have to Make as a Country in Terms of Our Values\u2019", "url": "http://cnsnews.com/news/article/terence-p-jeffrey/obama-there-fundamental-decision-we-have-make-country-terms-our", "image": {"src": "http://cdn.cnsnews.com/obama-baby-ap_photo.jpg"}, "site": "@cnsnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "*/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0c61\"", "article_summary": "(AP Photo/Ben Margot)(CNSNews.com) - In an event held at a private home in Los Angeles on Saturday, President Barack Obama said that America must make a \u201cfundamental decision\u201d about its values.\nPresident Obama holds a baby in San Francisco on Oct. 10, 2015.\n\u201cYou believe in justice; you believe in equality; you believe in opportunity; you believe in diplomacy.\nWhen Pope Francis was in Washington, D.C. last month he visited one of the Little Sister's nursing homes to show solidarity with them in their fight to preserve their religious freedom.\n\u201cI believe that this country works best not when we're only thinking about ourselves but when we're thinking about others,\u201d he said."}
