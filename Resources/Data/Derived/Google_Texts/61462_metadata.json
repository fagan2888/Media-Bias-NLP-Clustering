Get Started \u00bb\n\nIn fields as varied as robotics, finance, biomedical engineering and education, these innovators have taken a decidedly humanistic approach to effecting positive change. It\u2019s a benevolent form of leadership that is driving real results while setting the stage for the next generation of socially conscious entrepreneurs. Keep an eye out for these women and their pioneering work\u2014we have no doubt you\u2019ll be seeing more of them.\n\nLauren Bush Lauren\n\nImage credit: Jesse Dittmar\n\nLauren Bush Lauren\u2019s FEED tackles hunger through commerce\n\nLauren Bush Lauren has a singular focus: feeding hungry people. Her New York-based consumer-goods company, FEED Projects, and its associated nonprofit, FEED Foundation, define success in terms of meals provided\u201485 million in seven years, the equivalent of roughly $11 million.\n\nBush Lauren, 30, believes social entrepreneurship is most effective when the mission is clear to the consumer. FEED Projects sends funds from products sold\u2014each stamped with a number indicating how many donated meals will result from the purchase\u2014to its partners on the ground fighting hunger: UNICEF, United Nations World Food Programme and Feeding America. As part of its fundraising initiatives, FEED Foundation creates events that ultimately support the same organizations. The dollar equivalent of each meal is 11 cents in the U.S. and 10 cents internationally.\n\n\u201cFEED connects consumers to the cause of hunger,\u201d Bush Lauren explains. \u201cIf it is not quick and easy and simple, you lose the consumer. FEED is a nice way to hook people and make them more aware of what is happening around the world. That\u2019s the role we can play.\u201d\n\nFEED\u2019s simple calculus and youthful, well-designed products such as bags, bracelets, scarves and T-shirts have engaged Bush Lauren\u2019s Millennial peers and made the company a model for other anti-hunger advocates. \u201cIt is a very big deal to reach young\n\npeople on hunger,\u201d says Billy Shore, founder and CEO of Share Our Strength, which created the \u201cNo Kid Hungry\u201d campaign. Bush Lauren\u2019s model of social entrepreneurship, he adds, \u201chas taught us a broader lesson: the opportunity for nonprofits to create wealth instead of just redistributing wealth.\u201d\n\nA new deal with West Elm will enable FEED to be even more effective at that mission. For the partnership, Bush Lauren worked with the home furnishings company to design a 30-item range of FEED housewares (in West Elm stores now); a spring collection and a steady stream of other projects will follow.\n\n\u201cShe articulated our culture absolutely perfectly,\u201d says Jim Brett, who was named West Elm president in 2010 and has turned the chain of more than 65 stores into Williams-Sonoma Inc.\u2019s fastest-growing brand, in large part by partnering with high-profile designers.\n\nBush Lauren\u2019s renown came at a young age. She doubled down on fame and fortune when she married David Lauren, son of American designer Ralph Lauren, in 2011. But as the granddaughter of one U.S. president and the niece of another, she already led an exceptional life. She modeled part time while attending Princeton University. She traveled around the world as a student ambassador for the U.N.\u2019s World Food Programme.\n\nIt was while working with the U.N. in Guatemala in 2003, dishing up corn and soya porridge for schoolchildren, that she was inspired to make fighting hunger her mission and refocused her budding design career on creating products that would\n\nengage others in that cause.\n\nWith no business experience, she founded FEED in 2007 and grew it slowly through a series of mostly one-off partnerships made possible through connections. This gained her access to the professional expertise she lacked, while the partners\n\nassumed most of the risk of developing FEED\u2019s products, as well as managing distribution and marketing.\n\n\u201cFEED has been built on partnerships,\u201d Bush Lauren says. \u201cFEED offers this nice, easy, clear solution for our partner companies to engage with the mission of hunger, to allow their consumers to participate with them in giving back.\u201d\n\nThe longest-running partnership has been with skincare giant Clarins, which has provided 6 million meals through its \u201cGift with Purpose\u201d FEED bag program. Other collaborators have included Whole Foods Market, Godiva, DKNY, Target, Barnes & Noble, Gap, Women\u2019s Health magazine, HSN, Lord & Taylor, Pottery Barn, Bergdorf Goodman and Harrods.\n\n\u201cTo have these amazing, prebuilt machines behind our brand and our mission really helped amplify what we are trying to do,\u201d Bush Lauren says.\n\nThe Whole Foods partnership was a major breakthrough. \u201cIt showed me the magnitude of the impact, positioning and branding that you can have with a good partner. That partnership alone fed all of the schoolchildren in Rwanda for a year.\n\nJust selling one bag\u2014the FEED 100 Bag\u2014across the country in their stores.\u201d\n\nA three-month promotion with Target in 2013 placed FEED products in departments throughout the store. \u201cTo have the Target sourcing team behind the FEED brand was spectacular,\u201d Bush Lauren says. \u201cTo go into product categories like apparel, and experience and play with things we hadn\u2019t been able to do before\u2014denim shirts, hoodies, tea towels, pie pans and bicycles. It was really neat to see FEED translated across so many categories.\u201d\n\nThe secret to a successful corporate partnership, she adds, \u201cis saying no to opportunities that may seem good, but in the end compromise your brand and your vision.\u201d\n\nFEED\u2019s corporate partners seem to appreciate that clarity. \u201c[Bush Lauren\u2019s] very strong will helps keep the FEED brand strong,\u201d says Maria Dempsey, executive vice president of marketing at Clarins. \u201cShe will not let another company dictate her brand. She makes sure her partnerships reinforce her values.\u201d\n\nBush Lauren is saying no more often these days as she edits the FEED portfolio. She wants fewer but deeper, more substantive relationships with partner companies that will allow FEED to engage directly with consumers. To this end, in the fall she launched FEED Supper, a monthlong campaign to inspire customers to host fundraising dinner parties for the FEED Foundation, which launched around the same time as the West Elm line. It was a powerful combination; with social media interactions rising, the company saw robust sales of the housewares collection and a spike in donations, which enabled FEED to deliver 1.8 million meals.\n\nBush Lauren continues to expand FEED\u2019s line of proprietary products\u2014a diaper bag is one example\u2014and ramp up sales on the company\u2019s website. \u201cWe are giving our consumers a reason to come back and shop FEED time and again,\u201d she says. Going forward, \u201cwe want to offer our consumers the same products on our site that our partners are offering on theirs, something West Elm allows us to do.\n\n\u201cWe are developing FEED into more of a lifestyle brand with daily touchpoints for consumers to interact with us as a brand and as a mission,\u201d she adds. \u201cWe want to scale our impact and our business.\u201d\n\nAs part of that, FEED is bringing more operations in-house. \u201cWe want to be less reliant on others,\u201d Bush Lauren says. \u201cPartnerships continue to be a way for us to test next steps for FEED without having to fully invest our staff with the responsibilities, time and resources. But we have great product development, great logistics, great marketing in-house now. We are capable of doing this on our own.\u201d\n\nBush Lauren\u2019s directness is her trademark. And she runs her office accordingly. \u201cI expect everyone to be entrepreneurial and very collaborative,\u201d she explains. \u201cYou have to be. If you aren\u2019t, it immediately shows. That means taking the initiative,\n\nproblem-solving, being self-taught, learning things you may not have initially known, taking a class, calling friends, figuring it out, learning how we can do things better. Taking on more and more responsibility.\u201d\n\nAs it evolves, FEED maintains its focus on delivering meals, including the same bare-bones porridge Bush Lauren first served to students in Guatemala. As the face of the organization, she is aware she is selling herself, and that means dealing with a larger-than-life family heritage. But she deliberately stays above the political fray; she has not jumped into the congressional debate over cuts to food stamps or joined first lady Michelle Obama\u2019s crusade to improve the lunches served in public schools.\n\n\u201cIt is a conscious choice of how you want to be perceived,\u201d she says. \u201cYou act in a way you want to be seen. You meet me, you have to get past my name and move on to more real things.\u201d\n\n\u2014Corie Brown\n\nCynthia Breazeal\n\nImage credit: Josh Andrus\n\nEnhancing the human experience through social technology\n\nThere are always complaints that the latest, greatest technologies are alienating, pulling the user out of the human experience. But what if we could make technology that\u2019s humanized, capable of bringing people together, fostering connection and empowerment?\n\nThat\u2019s the question that drives Cynthia Breazeal, a pioneer of social robotics. The founder and director of MIT Media Lab\u2019s Personal Robots Group recently took a leave of absence to launch Jibo, the first social robot designed for home use. She\u2019s exploring what it means to bring high-tech, humanized robotics into our living rooms.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just about this natural interface; it\u2019s appreciating that human beings, when we experience the world and make decisions and take action, certainly consider information, but we consider all these other factors,\u201d Breazeal says. \u201cIt\u2019s social, it\u2019s emotional, it\u2019s also physical. The more technology can support a holistic human experience, the more empowered we are to be more successful. A social robot is this technology that speaks to human experience for the first time [in] all these dimensions at once.\u201d\n\nFor years Breazeal has explored how anthropomorphized robots instilled with interpersonal skills can facilitate everything from childhood education to managing chronic disease, to senior care and even the creation of family memories. For example, a social robot can help a grandfather who lives far from his family see and play a game with his granddaughter in real time.\n\nIn addition to enhancing interaction, robotics technology can be effective at encouraging better behavior, Breazeal says. Take a robot that functions as an exercise coach. Breazeal has found that a human-like appearance, interface, movements and interactions create more desirable and\u2014more important\u2014longer-lasting results than other forms of technology.\n\n\u201cIf you can create technology that humanizes and engages people that feels like it\u2019s treating us like another person, people become more empowered, people do better,\u201d she says.\n\nIt\u2019s no Rosie from The Jetsons (though friendlier and arguably more helpful), but Breazeal\u2019s Jibo robot\u2014which she crowdfunded on Indiegogo, raising $2.3 million on a goal of $100,000\u2014acts like an additional family member to enable interpersonal interactions. It has all the functions of a smartphone but also serves as a hands-free reminder, messenger (it recognizes each member of the household), storyteller (complete with sound effects, graphics and movements), avatar (a see-and-track camera supports video calls) and assistant. Imagine: At the behest of a simple phrase or motion, Jibo takes pictures of precious family moments without one person having to step out and get behind a camera; business travelers can use the robot\u2019s video chat to be part of a family dinner or put the kids to bed. Jibo can even order takeout.\n\nBreazeal is working to take such experiences even further. \u201cTechnology is tremendously empowering and scalable and affordable\u2014and God knows people need more support that\u2019s affordable,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s an undeniable need, but there\u2019s a lot of room for improvement for us as technologists, as scientists, as engineers, to create technology that better supports our human values.\u201d \u2014Michelle Juergen\n\nRamona Pierson\n\nImage credit: Gabriella Hasbun\n\nA neuroscientist individualizes the path to learning\n\nRamona Pierson, CEO of education technology company Declara, doesn\u2019t believe in a one-size-fits-all world. Rather, she sees a future in which learning is personalized.\n\nShe launched Palo Alto, Calif.-based Declara in 2012 to develop a technology platform that creates learning experiences based on a person\u2019s user profile and interactions with data. Instead of hammering people with too much too quickly, the\n\nsystem delivers the information and resources users need, precisely when they\u2019re ready for it.\n\nDeclara uses machine learning, algorithms and recommendations to create a \u201clearning path\u201d for each individual based on how they interact with data, both informational (websites, documents) and social (tweets, blog posts).\n\n\u201cDeclara is about helping people be lifelong learners,\u201d Pierson explains. \u201cWe really look at their intentions and interests so we can automate the ontologies of learning pathways \u2026 and pull in open content and proprietary content into learning packages and be able to recommend those to them. And next year, we\u2019ll start bringing in biometric data to really help.\u201d\n\nBefore starting Declara, Pierson ran a company that partnered with McGraw-Hill Education to launch a product called the \u201cPower of U\u201d to teach mathematics to grade-school students.\n\n\u201cWe saw very quickly that we were able to take kids who were lagging behind in math by three years and catch them up to their age peers in six weeks by really changing the modality of learning to match the kids\u2019 preferences and how they actually learn,\u201d Pierson says. \u201cSo I thought, Well, can we create a company that can do this at scale?\u201d\n\nScale indeed. Declara\u2019s first client was Education Services Australia, which brought the company on to help introduce teachers to a new curriculum. Declara has since started working with the teachers\u2019 union of Mexico (1.6 million teachers strong)\n\nand in Puerto Rico. To further its international reach, the company has created subsidiaries in Mexico and Singapore and is building one in Brazil.\n\nBut educators aren\u2019t the only learners who can benefit; Declara has also introduced a platform for enterprise learning. The company is in its second year of working with biotech firm Genentech. \u201cIt really helps with the onboarding of new employees and moving people into becoming managers or high-level executives,\u201d Pierson says.\n\nAnd come spring, Declara will launch a \u201cprosumer\u201d version for individual use. \u201cImagine people who may have health issues. We can start to build automated pathways for individuals who are trying to hit goals of losing weight or hitting those metrics to change their lives.\u201d Think of the system as a more targeted Google, one in which only useful information makes it through to the user\u2019s workspace.\n\nA neuroscientist and former Marine, Pierson had one experience that taught her\u2014the very hardest way\u2014how difficult learning can be. Struck by a drunk driver when she was 22, Pierson spent 18 months in a coma and then had to relearn pretty much everything.\n\n\u201cWhat would have been amazing for me is to have been able to receive curated content and curated experts to really help,\u201d she says. \u201cThe thing about Declara is we\u2019re not using machine learning to remove the human, but to actually bring in the expertise of other people into our learning experience.\u201d \u2014Jenna Schnuer\n\nSangeeta Bhatia\n\nImage credit: MIT\n\nA biotech engineer fights disease through innovation\n\nThere\u2019s a lot that\u2019s impressive about Dr. Sangeeta Bhatia. The 46-year-old biomedical and mechanical engineer, physician, professor, inventor and entrepreneur has been anointed one of the most innovative young scientists worldwide and one of the 100 most creative people in business, to name just two of her accolades. The co-founder of biotech startups Zymera and Hepregen, she won the 2014 Lemelson-MIT Prize of $500,000 for her groundbreaking inventions in miniaturized biomedical technologies and youth mentorship.\n\nBut the most impressive thing about Bhatia? She\u2019s only getting started.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been a little bit of an impatient inventor in the sense that I know there are really big problems out there, and we\u2019re only just scratching the surface. I always seek to move beyond what we\u2019ve found to try to make the biggest impact with whatever we have on hand,\u201d says Bhatia, a graduate of MIT and Harvard.\n\nTwo of her most lauded inventions thus far are synthetic biomarkers that detect cancer through a paper urine test and a human microliver built from scratch to fight infectious disease by predicting drug toxicity and interacting with human pathogens. The microlivers provide a basis for an engineered liver that may one day replace the need for transplants in patients with liver disease.\n\nBhatia attributes her success to mentors who \u201csaw more for me than I saw for myself\u201d and to diversity\u2014of experience, of interests, of colleagues. Her portfolio of inventions reflects this: In addition to drug toxicity and cancer therapeutics, she has addressed problems in the areas of tissue regeneration, noninvasive diagnostics and infectious disease.\n\n\u201cInnovation happens at the interfaces of different disciplines. Because I was an engineer and trained in miniaturization, I realized there was a whole world of microfabrication, which was invented for making computer chips, and the whole word of nanotechnology, which was a material-science invention. These things have been developed over the course of 50 years by teams of amazing people, and they were really right to be borrowed for medical applications,\u201d she says. \u201cThat idea that you can combine fields and really leapfrog in advances has been something we try to repeat over and over again by bringing in diverse teams with diverse perspectives and experiences.\u201d\n\nThough she has received much acclaim, Bhatia admits her journey hasn\u2019t always been easy. \u201cOne thing I struggled with a lot when I was coming up through the pipeline was looking forward to seeing if there were women who had the life I thought I wanted. It didn\u2019t seem like there were a lot of great examples of that,\u201d she recalls.\n\nSo Bhatia is a strong advocate for promoting STEM fields (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) to women, getting more women into high-tech entrepreneurship and being a model for what young girls can achieve. \u201cI try to be really transparent about the way I\u2019m living my life,\u201d she says. \u201cI think that\u2019s part of paying it forward and keeping the door open for women behind you.\u201d \u2014M.J.\n\nAngela Lee\n\nImage credit: Axel Dupeux\n\nClosing the gender gap in investing\n\nAngela Lee won\u2019t be satisfied until U.S. startup investment groups boast as many women among their ranks as men.\n\nLess than 20 percent of accredited angel investors in the U.S. are women, according to a report from the University of New Hampshire\u2019s Peter T. Paul College of Business and Economics. And at venture capital firms, women account for just 6 percent of all partners, says a study by Babson College\u2019s Arthur M. Blank Center for Entrepreneurship.\n\nTo help close the gap, Lee founded 37 Angels, an angel investment network based in New York City. Since 2012, the 50-member group has invested $50,000 to $200,000 in 25 startups, both female- and male-led.\n\nWhile Lee\u2014a serial entrepreneur, investor and assistant dean at Columbia Business School, where she teaches leadership and strategy courses\u2014is passionate about helping women founders, her top priority is getting more women to invest. \u201cThere are a lot of resources right now focused on helping the female entrepreneur,\u201d Lee says, referring to the recent spate of educational, networking and financing groups. \u201cThere are very few folks that help the female investor.\u201d\n\nTo that end, 37 Angels offers a monthlong, hands-on boot camp for qualified female investors who want to join the network. Attendees\u2014half of whom are entrepreneurs themselves\u2014learn what to look for in a pitch, how valuation works and what to do after writing a startup a check. At the end of the program, angels make a $5,000 investment in one of half a dozen startups presenting at 37 Angels\u2019 pitch forums, held five times a year. As an unexpected bonus, several women who\u2019ve gone through the boot camp have since taken venture capital jobs, Lee says.\n\nSeeding startups with mentorship is as much a focus as sharing the wealth. At the end of each pitch forum, presenters can ask the angels for help, be it an introduction to a Google exec or a top-notch Ruby on Rails developer. \u201cWe try really hard to instill a service mentality with the angels,\u201d Lee says.\n\n37 Angels takes pitches from both female- and male-run companies. Lee doesn\u2019t want to restrict women from investing in startups that interest them, regardless of who\u2019s at the helm, and she doesn\u2019t want investors to feel obligated to fund women as some sort of diversity or social responsibility initiative.\n\n\u201cFor me, it\u2019s really important to remove the asterisks of investing in women,\u201d Lee says. \u201cWhen a woman gets funded, everyone knows it\u2019s because she\u2019s awesome. It wasn\u2019t because it was \u2018the right thing to do.\u2019\u201d Besides, Lee adds, with more women investors, \u201cI do think that more women and a more diverse type of startup will get funded.\u201d \u2014Michelle Goodman\n\nDanielle Fong\n\nImage credit: Robert Schlatter\n\nThe brightest new force in clean power storage\n\n\u201cConfident. Connected. Open to change.\u201d Typically, stereotyping Millennials is a surefire way to underestimate them. But the characteristics listed in a 2010 Pew Research Center report on \u201cGeneration Next\u201d are spot-on descriptors for Danielle Fong, the 27-year-old co-founder and chief science officer of LightSail Energy.\n\nA junior-high dropout from Nova Scotia who began college at age 12 and started a Ph.D. program at Princeton\u2019s Plasma Physics Laboratory at 17, Fong left school just shy of her 20th birthday to move across the U.S. to Berkeley, Calif., with the aim of addressing the world\u2019s energy crisis.\n\nThe result, LightSail, is tackling the thorny issue of energy storage, \u201ca problem that\u2019s been around for literally a century,\u201d says co-founder and CEO Steve Crane. There are many methods of stockpiling watts for later, but none are ideal; batteries are expensive and gradually degrade, while oil and gas are volatile and subject to geopolitical turmoil. Pointing out that Thomas Edison unsuccessfully \u201cbeat his head against\u201d the energy-storage issue, Crane says Fong \u201cwas able to think about the problem literally from first principles down to atoms and molecules. I had never heard anybody do that before.\u201d\n\nFong and Crane met in 2008, when she was taking a year to work odd computer jobs across Silicon Valley\u2014positions she sought deliberately in order to grow her personal network. \u201cStarting a company alone was kind of a lonely thing,\u201d says Fong, a self-described social person. \u201cI wanted a co-founder.\u201d By traveling around, meeting people and working on their projects, she hoped to network and also prove her own worth. During this time, she crashed on friends\u2019 couches and helped out with their startups.\n\nMeanwhile, Fong continued to refine her energy plans. \u201cI kept a list of ideas in a spreadsheet with all kinds of different details, like what it would cost, how long it would take, what are the risks, who you would sell to,\u201d she says.\n\nThe brightest idea\u2014the basis for LightSail\u2014is a means of collecting and releasing energy on demand through the use of tanks of compressed air injected with a water mist. Instead of burning fossil fuel, the system uses renewable energy like solar or wind power to compress air; when electricity is needed, the air is expanded to drive pistons that operate a generator. (It\u2019s mechanically similar to piston engines.) The high-strength, low-cost air tanks are, Fong believes, the first that make it viable to use compressed air for electricity storage.\n\nThe motor metaphor is appropriate, says Fong, because automotive engines produce energy at about 5 cents per watt, compared to solar cells, which run $1 per watt, and power plants that charge around $2. \u201cIf you calculate it out, you add up all the power from all of the automobiles throughout the world, it\u2019s\u2014order-of-magnitude\u2014100 times that of the electrical power on the grid today,\u201d she explains.\n\nThe technology grabbed the attention of early-stage investors. Vinod Khosla became Berkeley-based LightSail\u2019s first outside investor after the company\u2019s founding in 2009. In 2011 Fong and the LightSail team were invited to attend the Khosla Ventures CEO Summit and to present to Bill Gates. The Windows creator even sent LightSail\u2019s research to Nathan Myhrvold, a physicist and the founder of Microsoft Research, to make sure all the physics penciled out. Gates personally invested in LightSail in 2012.\n\nThe 55-person company has netted $58 million, even attracting Peter Thiel to the portfolio after the outspoken investor called clean tech a \u201cdisaster\u201d just the year before. \u201cIt\u2019s time to find honest companies that can develop technologies that stand on real innovation instead of the backs of taxpayers,\u201d Thiel said in a statement upon backing the company in 2012. \u201cLightSail is run by engineers, not salespeople, and it promises to be one of the first true alternative energy storage companies.\u201d\n\nWith plans to deploy its first storage system late this year, then four more in 2016, LightSail\u2019s technology will soon begin to change the world\u2014and the trillion-dollar energy industry. In fact, in one of LightSail\u2019s first demonstrations ever, Fong\u2019s technology will be used to bank energy for a wind farm on the coast of Nova Scotia, not far from where she grew up.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s also a great excuse to come home,\u201d she says. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to pay for hotels.\u201d\n\n\u2014John Patrick Pullen", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "none", "globalsign-domain-verification": "MT3LmRzGYPgORWLlSBkPpAUpBDH9kl8xxYmB6FjtjY", "googlebot": "index,follow,NOODP", "news_keywords": "Innovators,Entrepreneurs,The Innovators,Women Entrepreneurs,Women-Business Owners,Startup Success Stories,Innovator Profiles,Innovators Profile,Women in Business,slideshow", "copyright": "Copyright 2016 Entrepreneur Media, Inc.
