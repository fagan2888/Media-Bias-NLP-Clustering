Christopher Weaver from the Wall Street Journal reports:\n\nUniversal Health Services Inc.\u2019s revenue rose 10% for the second quarter compared with a year earlier. LifePoint Hospitals Inc.\u2019s profit rose to $39.1 million for the quarter, a 44% increase compared with last year\u2019s quarter. . . . About half of the eight million people who obtained coverage in health-law marketplaces between October and mid-April arrived in the final six weeks of the extended enrollment period. \u201c\n\nLifePoint, a Tennessee-based hospital chain, estimate that Obamacare enrollees used about $13 million worth of services during the last quarter, which is over double the anticipated amount \u2014 their profits also rose by 44 percent. LifePoint reports a 2 percent increase in patient volume overall, and higher rates of severe medical conditions and emergency-room visits.\n\nObamacare supporters can celebrate this as more evidence that the law is increasing access \u2014 and they could be right (about increasing access). But at what cost? A few weeks ago, I wrote about how doctor visits don\u2019t seem to be increasing under the health law, and these reports add to evidence that patients are continuing to get care in emergency rooms (the most expensive setting by a long shot) instead of doctor\u2019s offices. If that\u2019s happening at a substantial rate, for whatever reason, Obamacare isn\u2019t working as we\u2019d have liked.\n\nDid the long-term unemployed finally catch a break? We really don\u2019t know.\n\nAt Wonkblog, Matt O\u2019Brien breaks down unemployment numbers since the beginning of this year, and reports that 88 percent of the total decline in unemployment during the past six months is due to a decline in the long-term unemployment rate (those jobless for 27 weeks or more). If they\u2019re getting jobs, this would be a great development, since long-term unemployment is both a serious financial and personal affliction, and a situation from which it\u2019s very hard to get back into the ranks of the employed.\n\nBut you can exit the ranks of the unemployed by getting a job or by leaving the labor force altogether. Which one is happening for the long-term unemployed? What happened to these people since the beginning of this year is of special interest since unemployment benefits for a substantial share of them abruptly ended on December 31, when Congress didn\u2019t extend long-term unemployment benefits as it had for the entire recession, so we might find something out about how that program affects incentives and economic outcomes.\n\nThere\u2019s some reason for pessimism: Monthly numbers indicate that rate at which the long-term unemployed are finding jobs is still similar to the rate at which they did throughout the recession. But O\u2019Brien points out that shifts between the group of long-term unemployed one month and those who have jobs the next month aren\u2019t that reliable because the long-term unemployed are kind of exceptional: They\u2019re so tenuously attached to the labor force that some months, they don\u2019t look for a job at all, so they have technically dropped out of the labor force. But they might look for a job the next month and get one \u2014 that wouldn\u2019t count, in terms of monthly numbers, as a successful transition out of long-term unemployment.\n\nTo address that issue, a couple Fed economists examined whether people who were among the long-term unemployed one year ago have found a job by now \u2014 and it turns out that lots of them have, and that they\u2019re finding jobs at a slightly higher rate than earlier cohorts of the long-term unemployed had. The likelihood of their having found a job is also slightly higher than the likelihood that they\u2019ve dropped out of the labor force:\n\nWhy might this be? We could be seeing improvements because more people may be more willing to search for and take jobs since unemployment benefits ended, as some Republicans have suggested. But evidence also indicates that decreases in the short-term unemployment rate are correlated with higher job-finding rates for the long-term unemployed \u2014 and the short-term unemployment rate has been dropping.\n\nThe president extended federal health benefits to seasonal workers today, without asking Congress.\n\nThe president plans to enact two new rules giving temporary and seasonal government workers access to the same health care that most other federal employees get, a set of insurance options called the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. As Pete Kasperowicz from the Blaze points out, the new rules seem to contradict existing law and lack congressional approval:\n\nThe rule from the Office of Personnel Management would let these federal workers sign up for coverage under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, and also allow some of them to enjoy a government contribution to their insurance premiums. Both steps would be done through OPM\u2019s proposed regulation, and not through an act of Congress. . . . But the change would appear to go against a 1978 law that, according to the Congressional Research Service, does not make temporary or intermittent workers eligible for the FEHB program.\n\nMost persons who work full time (30 hours a week) for at least 90 days will be eligible to sign up for heavily subsidized health care under the FEHB \u2014 as far as employer-provided health care, and certainly health care in general, goes, it\u2019s a very good deal. The OPM report says that the rules will cost about $100 million, but the cost could be much greater \u2014 this number is based on their prediction that only 10 to 20 percent of newly eligible persons will sign up for care.\n\nWill it be money well spent? Maybe, maybe not. Intuitively, providing consistent, year-round coverage to seasonal workers is bound to result in some health improvements, but to my knowledge, there isn\u2019t data to suggest this is so. In fact, the OPM proposal says there is no evidence of what public-health effects the new rules may produce. Spending even $100 million a year to enact a potentially ineffective executive order probably just isn\u2019t good public policy.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.date": "Tue, 2014-07-29 20:00", "sailthru.author": "Callie Gable", "description": "Hospitals are seeing profits increase under Obamacare.\n\nSome hospitals are making millions from new Obamacare patients.
