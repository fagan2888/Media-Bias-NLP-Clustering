They were telling me, \u2018I had to borrow against my house, and then I had to borrow against my car, just to survive,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBrokers are very reliant on their source of income every 30 days. It\u2019s a whole secondary crisis here. Some of these people are going to be bankrupt.\u201d\n\nCallister said he doesn\u2019t know why the exchange isn\u2019t paying commissions. Nor does he know how many brokers might be involved.\n\nHe did note that as many as 1,500 brokers are licensed to sell through the exchange.\n\nMazzone declined to discuss the lawsuit in detail Wednesday, though he did say \u201cit makes life extremely difficult when you don\u2019t get paid after working very hard.\u201d\n\nHe said the lawsuit was necessary because there doesn\u2019t seem to be a resolution on the way from Xerox.\n\nCommissions are supposed to be paid to brokers by insurers once the consumer pays for coverage.\n\nThe lawsuit claims the defendants failed in their duty to ensure broker producer numbers and other identifying details were provided to insurers. It also alleges Xerox and the exchange \u201cimproperly retained premiums paid by consumers and collected interest on those premiums for months while causing unnecessary delays in the payments of commissions to brokers and agents.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the state exchange \u201cbreached its duty\u201d to \u201cuse reasonable care in conducting due diligence\u201d on a contractor for Nevada Health Link, the filing said.\n\nContact reporter Jennifer Robison at jrobison@reviewjournal.com.
