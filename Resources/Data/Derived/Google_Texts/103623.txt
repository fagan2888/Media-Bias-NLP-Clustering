Gary Oldman has apologized for (just) one of the offensive comments he made during a recent Playboy interview, in which he defended the homophobic, sexist and racist rants of Alec Baldwin and Mel Gibson, and rallied against a “hypocritical” culture of “political correctness.” The actor, who insulted Jews, women, gays and African-Americans, apologized for a rant deemed anti-Semitic by the Anti-Defamation League and the Simon Wiesenthal Center.

‘“Mel Gibson is in a town that’s run by Jews,” Oldman had said in the interview of Gibson’s own 2006 anti-Semitic rant against Jews running Hollywood, “and he said the wrong thing because he’s actually bitten the hand that I guess has fed him – and doesn’t need to feed him anymore because he’s got enough dough.”

In response, Rabbi Marvin Hier, dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles, said, “Gary Oldman wants Jews to ‘get over’ what Mel Gibson said. But what Gibson said, was the slogan that Adolf Hitler used to murder six million Jews.” Hier explained to the AP that, “(Oldman’s) comment that Hollywood is a town ‘run by Jews’ has a very familiar sinister ring to it that is the anthem of bigots and anti-Semites everywhere. That has nothing to do with political correctness.”

The outcry prompted Oldman to issue an apology on Tuesday night via a letter to the Anti-Defamation League. “I am deeply remorseful that comments I recently made in the Playboy Interview were offensive to many Jewish people,” the letter begins, continuing, “Upon reading my comments in print — I see how insensitive they may be, and how they may indeed contribute to the furtherance of a false stereotype.” Oldman has said nothing, however, to suggest that he no longer supports Baldwin’s habitual use of homophobic slurs.
