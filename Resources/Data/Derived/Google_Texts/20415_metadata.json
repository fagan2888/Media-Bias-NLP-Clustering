However, the deal also has to be approved by federal antitrust regulators who want to make sure industry consolidation does not substantially lessen competition.\n\nIn the two-hour hearing of the Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy and Consumer Rights, federal lawmakers and antitrust regulators last Thursday voiced concerns about the swelling wave of merger activity in industries ranging from software to hard liquor.\n\nThe committee\u2019s ranking member said she fears the government\u2019s traditional approach to preserving competition, which entails requiring companies to sell parts of their business to competitors, has not worked.\n\nAnother member had a tougher message: The nation\u2019s approach to preserving competition has failed and must be reformed.\n\nBaer said the department faces considerable challenges because global merger and acquisition volume has reached record levels in number, size and complexity.\n\nFrom fiscal year 2014 to fiscal 2015, the number of proposed mergers valued at more than $1 billion nearly doubled to 280. The number of deals worth more than $10 billion more than doubled to 67.\n\nDuring the recession, a lot of companies kept their capital on the sidelines, but now that the economy is improving, they are again investing, Baer said. And many are investing big.\n\nThe nation\u2019s antitrust watchdogs, the DoJ and the Federal Trade Commission, have increasingly objected to proposed mergers: In 2013, the DoJ challenged 15 deals. Last year, it filed suit in 20, including in AB Electrolux\u2019 proposed acquisition of General Electric\u2019s Louisville-based appliance division.\n\nThe DoJ and the FTC, which filed 17 suits last year, try to stop mergers when their analysis shows the deals would increase prices, lower quality or reduce innovation.\n\nHealth care mergers under fire\n\nSen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said that since the passage of the Affordable Care Act, he has received lots of complaints from his constituents about higher insurance deductibles and co-pays. Grassley asked Baer how the DoJ would analyze the proposed mergers in the health care industry.\n\nBaer said the DoJ is investigating various aspects of the mergers, including how they would affect:\n\ncost and availability of care for consumers\n\ncosts to local, state and nationwide employers\n\ncompetition in local, statewide and national markets\n\n\u201cThese are transformational mergers in a number of markets, including Medicare Advantage and commercial insurance,\u201d Baer said.\n\nThe number of large national health insurance providers would shrink from five to three.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a game changer that demands merger law enforcement officials to scrutinize very, very carefully to make sure we aren\u2019t making a mistake in which shareholders benefit and the consumers pay the cost,\u201d Baer said.\n\nHe also said the Aetna-Humana and Cigna-Anthem proposals would be judged together on how they affect the industry as a whole.\n\n\u201cWhenever you have two major transactions in an already concentrated industry occurring roughly at the same time, one needs to look at the interaction between the two transactions and look down the road,\u201d Baer said. \u201cIt also affects one\u2019s view of whether or not one or both transactions are really fixable, because it could be a game changer.\u201d\n\nSen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said that antitrust regulators\u2019 traditional attempts to preserve competition during mergers has not worked, especially in health care.\n\n\u201cIn 2012, Humana made divestitures to three separate buyers \u2014 Cigna, WellCare and Vantage Health \u2014 in order to acquire Arcadian Management Services, and only one of the three buyers, Vantage, has managed to remain viable,\u201d he said. \u201cBoth Cigna and WellCare exited over 50 percent of the divested markets within three years of the merger.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are lessons to be learned here \u2026 about the effects of consolidation but also the futility and the failure of divestiture as a remedy,\u201d Blumenthal told Baer. \u201cThere are lessons to be learned here that I hope will prompt greater vigilance and vigor in your use of enforcement authority.\u201d\n\nAetna and Humana have said they believe the merged company would deliver better health care at lower prices.\n\nNew antitrust concerns\n\nCommittee members and antitrust regulators also discussed new challenges they are facing to preserve competition, both because of emerging online industries and more interwoven ownership structures of some public companies.\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., the committee\u2019s ranking member, said she wonders what Baer thought of situations such as Canadian Pacific\u2019s proposal to acquire Norfolk Southern. Canadian Pacific wants to put its shares in a trust, have the CEO resign, then join Norfolk Southern and become that company\u2019s CEO, the senator said.\n\nBaer said the DoJ worries about \u201csituations where parties propose to merge and then accomplish much of the merger prior to the antitrust review.\n\n\u201cThat strikes me as letting the fox into the chicken coop, subject to an investigation later of why there are so many feathers lying around.\u201d\n\nBlumenthal said that antitrust regulators need to take a more aggressive stance on preventing consolidation in the airline industry, in which four larger carriers control 80 percent of the market.\n\nHe said passengers see daily evidence of tighter capacity, rising fares and more ancillary fees.\n\nAnd, he said, the ownership of the airlines is providing little incentive for competitive behavior: Between 2013 and 2015, the seven shareholders who controlled 60 percent of United Airlines also controlled about 25 percent of Delta Airlines, Southwest Airlines and Jet Blue Airways.\n\nWhen United decides how much to compete against the three others, it has to make a judgment as to whether to harm its own shareholders who also own Delta, Southwest and JetBlue, Blumenthal said.\n\nBaer said antitrust regulators have never before encountered such a joint ownership situation.\n\n\u201cIt is an issue we are looking at \u2026 in more than one industry,\u201d he said.\n\nIn general, Baer said he agreed with Blumenthal that people who own a sizable number of shares in two competing companies have little incentive to make one company stand out over the other.\n\nThe committee also discussed consolidation in for-profit colleges and universities, the banking industry and online travel agencies.\n\nBoth the DoJ and FTC are requesting additional resources for fiscal 2017 so that their enforcement actions can continue to match the spike in merger activity. President Barack Obama has requested that Congress increase the DoJ\u2019s Antitrust Division budget by $16 million, or about 10 percent, to $180 million.\n\nBlumenthal said that given continued consolidation in industry after industry, the nation must rethink its antitrust approach.\n\n\u201cConsumers have been hit by a tsunami of consolidation, with the same economic effects as a natural disaster tsunami has on people who are in its way,\u201d said Blumenthal, a former attorney general.\n\n\u201cThe merger policy of our nation has simply failed,\u201d he said.\n\nKlobuchar, meanwhile, suggested the consolidation in some industries has reached a level of saturation.\n\n\u201cWe often talk about firms being too big to fail,\u201d she said. \u201cA question for modern antitrust enforcement is whether some mergers are too big to fix.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/wp-content/uploads/fbrfg/browserconfig.xml?v=PYYa6y0aQv", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Regulators will scrutinize Aetna-Humana deal \u201cvery, very carefully\u201d to make sure benefits to company shareholders don't come at the expense of consumers.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Insider Louisville", "description": "Regulators will scrutinize Aetna-Humana deal \u201cvery, very carefully\u201d to make sure benefits to company shareholders don't come at the expense of consumers.", "title": "Antitrust chief: Aetna-Humana proposal demands tough scrutiny - Insider Louisville", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1000, "identifier": "http://insiderlouisville.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Humana-HQ-by-night-e1458142292681.jpg", "height": 820}, "updated_time": "2016-03-16T17:41:47-04:00", "url": "http://insiderlouisville.com/business/healthcare/antitrust-chief-aetna-humana-proposal-demands-tough-scrutiny/", "type": "article"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#da532c", "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1496697903875229}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://i2.wp.com/insiderlouisville.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/cropped-favicon.png?fit=270%2C270", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/InsiderLouisville", "section": "Big Business", "tag": "WellCare", "published_time": "2016-03-16T11:32:14-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-16T17:41:47-04:00"}, "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "article_summary": "However, the deal also has to be approved by federal antitrust regulators who want to make sure industry consolidation does not substantially lessen competition.\nFrom fiscal year 2014 to fiscal 2015, the number of proposed mergers valued at more than $1 billion nearly doubled to 280.\nNew antitrust concernsCommittee members and antitrust regulators also discussed new challenges they are facing to preserve competition, both because of emerging online industries and more interwoven ownership structures of some public companies.\nBaer said antitrust regulators have never before encountered such a joint ownership situation.\nThe nation\u2019s antitrust watchdogs, the DoJ and the Federal Trade Commission, have increasingly objected to proposed mergers: In 2013, the DoJ challenged 15 deals."}
