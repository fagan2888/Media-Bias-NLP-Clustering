Steve Forbes, Forbes Media chairman & editor-In-chief, and "Reviving America," author, shares his thoughts on how to bring prosperity back to the U.S.

The mood on the campaign trail shows that Americans are not feeling better about the economy, Forbes Media Chairman and two-time Republican presidential candidate Steve Forbes said Thursday.

"You see the anger out there — angst about the economy, worry about the security of this country," he told CNBC's "Squawk Box." "People aren't worried about income inequality. They want growth in their own income."

In a new book, "Reviving America," Forbes is calling on GOP presidential candidates to adopt "radical" pro-growth initiatives, including repealing President Barack Obama's signature Affordable Care Act, implementing a flat tax and reducing the Federal Reserve's influence over monetary policy.

Forbes said he believes many Americans believe in these initiatives, and he wants to empower people to advocate for them.

"The candidates, many of them, are moving in that direction, but they have much more to do in terms of how you replace Obamacare," he said. "On the tax side, you've got to make some tweaks into their various tax proposals."

Forbes made the flat tax — which would establish a single rate for all Americans — a centerpiece of his first presidential run in 1996.

Ben Carson and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas have proposed flat-tax plans, while some other candidates have proposed similar one-size-fits-all plans or reductions to the number of tax brackets currently on the books.
