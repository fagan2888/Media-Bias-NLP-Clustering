Mark Sanford still sleeps on his Capitol Hill office couch when Congress is in session.\n\nThe South Carolina Republican is still on a mission to cut government spending, and he still votes for or against bills according to their price tags.\n\nSome things are different. He no longer rejects campaign contributions from political action committees, explaining he \u201ccrossed that Rubicon\u201d when he took corporate money as governor. While he has his own leadership PAC now, he claims to have forgotten it even existed. It boasts a single $5,000 contribution from the American Resort Development Association.\n\nAnd instead of taking a pledge to leave Congress after six years, he\u2019s now setting the goalpost at 12.\n\n\u201cBy then,\u201d Sanford said, \u201ceither I will have had an impact on the trajectory of our nation\u2019s finances, or I won\u2019t.\u201d\n\nNearly 15 years after he left Washington in pursuit of the governor\u2019s mansion in Columbia \u2014 and almost seven years since revelations of an extramarital affair that unraveled his personal and professional life \u2014 Sanford is serving his second stint as a rank-and-file member of Congress.\n\nIn many ways, Sanford is very much the man he\u2019s always been.\n\n\u201cHe has always been about ideas and policies,\u201d said S.C. GOP Chairman Matt Moore, who got his start in state politics working for Sanford in the governor\u2019s office.\n\nIn just as many ways, however, Sanford is undeniably changed.\n\n\u201cI think Mark looks at his second entry to politics as a bit of redemption,\u201d said U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. \u201cI see a Mark Sanford who is more self-aware.\u201d Graham added \u201cthe personal problems Mark was going through, he has learned from them. He\u2019s trying to be a stronger person.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with The Post and Courier, Sanford volunteered a self-assessment that touched on both themes. \u201cI would say in terms of ideology I continue to be a person who believes very strongly in the importance of limited government ... and liberty,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve been through certainly some experiences in life that would cause you to think a whole lot. It\u2019s not the mountaintops but rather the valleys of life that really give you time to reflect.\u201d\n\nThis could be Sanford\u2019s pitch to voters over the next few months. Versus state Rep. Jenny Horne, R-Summerville, he\u2019s facing the first primary challenge of this most recent congressional tenure.\n\n\u2018Two schools of thought\u2019\n\nSanford returned to Washington, D.C., with some degree of caution after winning his seat in the 2013 special election.\n\n\u201cIt was very important initially not to come in as a know-it-all and a former governor,\u201d said Sanford, who is quick to note he is currently the only former governor serving in the U.S. House.\n\n\u201cGiven the events of (2009), given the media aftermath, the only thing many of those members knew about me was that. I thought it was very important for me to come in and respectfully take my place in the membership and get to know the members.\u201d\n\nThe 2009 events collectively is the now-infamous episode in which the sitting governor disappeared from the state for days, ostensibly while \u201chiking the Appalachian Trail.\u201d In reality, Sanford was out of the country having an affair with his mistress in Argentina. Sanford survived the political fallout but assuredly will never be able to disassociate from the story.\n\nSo he chose to settle back into his old role quietly, taking positions on issues consistent with his record. He voted against reopening government after a 17-day shutdown over funding the Affordable Care Act, arguing it did nothing to drive down the debt. He opposed the 2013 farm bill because it spent too much money, despite the South Carolina economy\u2019s ties to agriculture. He supported the austere spending levels of sequestration even though it cut into the defense funding vital to his 1st District\u2019s military bases.\n\n\u201cThere are two schools of thought about legislative involvement,\u201d Sanford said. \u201cOne is transactional politics and the other is advocacy politics built around ideas. I have always been of the second camp \u2014 to be an advocate for ideas that I believe the people in the 1st District sent me to try to advance.\u201d\n\nSanford\u2019s involvement with the House Freedom Caucus embodies this philosophy most of all. The invitation-only coalition of roughly 40 congressional conservatives derives its power and influence through a reputation of saying \u201cno.\u201d When the group formed in early 2015, Sanford was asked to be a founding member. By September, the HFC had driven out Speaker John Boehner and prevented Boehner\u2019s No. 2, Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, from ascending to the post.\n\nSanford said he\u2019s made friends and allies among this group of like-minded conservatives who came to Congress in the most recent antiestablishment waves.\n\n\u201cBack in the early, mid-1990s, it was me and Ron Paul,\u201d Sanford said of the former libertarian-minded congressman from Texas. \u201cThere was a certain degree of isolation that goes with being one of two or one of three. And then you\u2019re governor for eight years of your life and a certain degree of isolation goes with that. While you might work with legislative teams, they don\u2019t feel your pain, they have a different level of experience.\u201d\n\nSanford has found he can even be something of an elder statesman inside the group. Last fall, he was one of a few voices urging fellow HFC members to endorse Wisconsin Republican Paul Ryan as the next Speaker. With Boehner out, and McCarthy no longer in contention, Ryan was the last viable alternative to lead the House GOP.\n\n\u201cOne of the things I brought up at Freedom Caucus is, \u2018Guys, you gotta know when to fold \u2018em,\u2019 \u201d Sanford recalled saying. \u201cMy point was, \u2018Guys, don\u2019t overplay your hand here. If you\u2019re the reason he doesn\u2019t become speaker, then, given the way the train has already left the station, this group is going to be marginalized within the conference and you can\u2019t fight every fight.\u2019 \u201d\n\nSanford wasn\u2019t sure he would have had that range of foresight in 1997, when he was part of a coup to take out then-Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga.\n\n\u201cWhen I was there last, I would charge after every rainbow,\u201d he said. \u201cYou name a crazy vote and I was there pretty close to it. I guess in the years past I might have looked for a fight even if it were only for effect and it would just highlight an issue.\n\n\u201cNowadays, on occasion I\u2019m open for a fight,\u201d Sanford said, \u201cbut I\u2019d rather have effect as well.\u201d\n\n\u2018Nobody wants to go first\u2019\n\nIf Horne wants to come after Sanford during the primary campaign \u2014 and she\u2019ll have to if she wants to win \u2014 she can hit him on some different fronts. She can poke him for always saying \u201cno\u201d as a member of the HFC. Sanford says he\u2019d counter there are plenty of times he said \u201cyes,\u201d even when it\u2019s not always popular.\n\n\u201cI was the first person to come out in the delegation against offshore drilling,\u201d Sanford said. He mentioned U.S. Rep. Tom Rice, R-Myrtle Beach, is now on his side on the issue. \u201cWould he have gotten on to that particular push without somebody else going before him? I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\n\u201cGuantanamo Bay,\u201d he continued. \u201cI was the first guy in the delegation saying what (Obama) is proposing to do here is unlawful. Nobody wants to go first in politics.\u201d\n\nHorne can question whether Sanford is staying accountable to his constituents, notwithstanding the frequent Facebook posts composed in painstaking detail. Sanford says he reviews all of them and writes many himself. He can reply with a nod to his membership on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, where he can keep an eye on the Port of Charleston and Charleston Harbor. On the Budget Committee, he can say he\u2019s in the first line of defense in keeping Republican leaders from advancing spending bills that fiscal hawks fear will lead the country to financial ruin.\n\nFinally, Horne can criticize him for his past, that time he disappeared for days on his secret romantic tryst in Argentina. Even in this respect, Sanford appears to have found some peace with how to talk about the whole disastrous ordeal.\n\n\u201cAs we age we end up with the scars, bruises and bumps of life, either of our own making or of life and its makings,\u201d Sanford said. \u201cNow I\u2019d say I\u2019m a more mature and measured human being than I was 15 years ago. That there is no substitute for life, both good and bad, and the perspective that comes with it.\u201d\n\nEmma Dumain is The Post and Courier\u2019s Washington, D.C., correspondent.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "U.S. Rep.
