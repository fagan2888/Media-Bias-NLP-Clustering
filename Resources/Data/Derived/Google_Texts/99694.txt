Forget Mitt Romney for 2016. Speaking to Fox News Sunday’s Chris Wallace, Romney explained that he was not running for president, adding that his time had “come and gone.”

That should put to rest some of the notions that somehow Romney would run again in 2016 after losing against President Obama in 2012.

In recent months, Romney was thrust back into the public conversation after hosting a series of events and fundraisers for Republicans. He has also done several media interviews where he criticized Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
