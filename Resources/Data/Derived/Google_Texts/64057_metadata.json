For an upcoming \"Coming Attractions\" (Via MerlinFTP Drop)\n\nIn a column last week, opinion editor Robert Mentzer wrote of the parent's lot of having to endure terrible children's television shows, with most of his ire directed at \"Thomas the Tank Engine.\" In story comments and on Facebook, readers weighed in on their own least-favorite kids' shows:\n\nGeorge Carlin was the best \"Thomas\" narrator! My kids are beyond children's TV, but for us the worst was \"Dora the Explorer.\" Her voice makes my skin crawl.\n\n\u2014 Ginny Bivin Sauer\n\n\"Doc McStuffins\" must die.\n\n\u2014 Rob Owen\n\nI enjoy Thomas, although I liked it much bwtter when I was a kid and George Carlin was the conductor and narrator! I like \"Timothy Goes to School\"; most of the \"children\" on that show are rude or have poor manners but if you look at kids today, that's pretty much how most of them are! Personally, I wish \"Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood\" were still on so my kids could enjoy it.\n\n\u2014 Shannon Genrich\n\nWhat I wish was still around: \"Bob the Builder\" and \"Higgly Town Heroes\" (beyond cute, but beyond my kids' ages). What I can't stand: all the junk on Cartoon Network (which my kids love).\n\n\u2014 Jen Keller Faust\n\n\"The Teletubbies\" and \"Yo Gabba Gabba\" are horrible!\n\n\u2014 Angela Baumann\n\nI love \"Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood.\" I miss \"Max and Ruby.\"\n\n\u2014 Aimee Gilkenson Fritzel\n\nColumn: Mentzer: 'Thomas the Tank Engine' and other awful shows\n\n\"Thomas\" is awesome; so was \"Bob the Builder\"! \"Dora\" is awful and annoying.\n\n\u2014 Mark McClure\n\nKeep in mind, they are kid shows. Just because there are hierarchies, it doesn't make it bad. The world is strewn with levels and differences of functionality of which kids need to be aware of, so I don't see that aspect of \"Thomas the Tank Engine\" as a bad thing. You don't have to extrapolate all aspects of the show to humans.\n\n\u2014 Mary Kowatch\n\nMy son loves \"Bubble Guppies,\" \"WallyKazaam,\" \"Curious George\" and \"Sesame Street.\" I refuse to let him watch \"SpongeBob Squarepants\" or \"Dora the Explorer.\" They drive me insane!\n\n\u2014 Sarah Kreager\n\nI love \"Thomas\"! The shows on Disney Junior, especially \"Mickey Mouse Clubhouse,\" are pretty good, too\n\n\u2014 Megan Grossklaus\n\nTo join the conversation, leave a comment online or visit www.facebook.com/wausaudailyherald and \"like\" our Facebook page.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://wdhne.ws/1rIzNWw", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Parents have a lot of opinions about the children's TV they're forced to sit through.", "og": {"site_name": "Daily Herald Media", "description": "Parents have a lot of opinions about the children's TV they're forced to sit through.", "title": "Kids' TV that makes our skin crawl", "url": "http://www.wausaudailyherald.com/story/opinion/2014/07/27/kids-tv-makes-skin-crawl/13177687/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/wausaudailyherald.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Parents have a lot of opinions about the children's TV they're forced to sit through.", "title": "Kids' TV that makes our skin crawl", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e0cb2afa52b4b9466957e3bb8c306a0271969c5c/c=0-0-720-720&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Wausau/2014/07/25/thomasthetankengine.jpg", "creator": "@wausauherald", "site": "@wausauherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=884268453", "fb": {"app_id": 187427251271455}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcea1b\"", "article_summary": "What I can't stand: all the junk on Cartoon Network (which my kids love).\nMy kids are beyond children's TV, but for us the worst was \"Dora the Explorer.\"\n\u2014 Aimee Gilkenson FritzelColumn: Mentzer: 'Thomas the Tank Engine' and other awful shows\"Thomas\" is awesome; so was \"Bob the Builder\"!\n\u2014 Sarah KreagerI love \"Thomas\"!\nIn story comments and on Facebook, readers weighed in on their own least-favorite kids' shows:George Carlin was the best \"Thomas\" narrator!"}
