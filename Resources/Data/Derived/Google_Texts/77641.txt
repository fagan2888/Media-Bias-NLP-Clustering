Before he received a phone call from the 303 area code, before he was signed to the practice squad and before he landed on the active roster, safety Josh Bush had a connection to the Broncos.

To hear Bush tell it, he would not have played in the NFL if not for former Denver linebacker Steve Russ. Now the defensive coordinator for the Air Force football team, Russ was the defensive backs coach at Wake Forest when Bush played there. NFL scouts dropped by Wake Forest to see wide receiver Chris Givens and defensive end Kyle Wilber during Bush’s senior year. Russ suggested Bush meet with them.

“Man, honestly, I wasn’t thinking about the NFL until Russ called me one day and said, ‘If you want to play in the National Football League, you’ve got a shot. Teams are asking about you,’ ” Bush said. “I was like, ‘All right, I might as well.’ “

The New York Jets selected Bush in the sixth round of the 2012 draft. He played 35 games for the Jets before losing his spot on the roster to linebacker Antwan Barnes in October, freeing the Broncos to sign him. Bush might be needed Sunday in the regular-season finale against the Oakland Raiders if safety T.J. Ward can’t play because of a sprained neck.

Bush spoke to The Denver Post last week about his new team, his baseball background and his love for producing music.

Q: You played a fair amount with the Jets. What was it like going from that role to the practice squad?

A: The practice squad was a whole different view on the business side of it. It was different, a different mind-set. You are doing your part during the week, then Sunday you are watching the games. When I came into the league, they said respect the process. I was actually coming off a quadriceps injury with the Jets, just trying to get healthy. I wasn’t worried about when I would come back. I needed to get healthy first.

Q: How do you view the possibility of playing Sunday if you’re needed?

A: I go in with the mind-set that I am going to play. That’s how I prepare. I learned that from the veterans. I try to learn as much as I can each week.

Q: You starred in baseball in high school. Was there any thought of pursuing a pro career on the diamond?

A: Baseball was just too boring. I played it because everybody else did. A lot of guys played it where I grew up, and they are in the minor leagues now. One of my best friends, Garrison Lassiter, got picked up by the Yankees (in the 27th round of the 2008 draft). He played in the minors, then went to Miami for football. My high school coach said don’t do that. I didn’t grow up with much money, and he knew what it would be like for me in the minor leagues. He didn’t want that for me. I listened to him and played only football as a senior.

Q: What are your favorite memories from your Wake Forest career?

A: The guys I played with. When I first came up we had Aaron Curry, Alphonso Smith, Riley Skinner, a lot of great players. We looked up to them, especially Curry. He was dominant.

Q: You played for Rex Ryan with the Jets. Ryan and the Broncos’ Jack Del Rio coached together in Baltimore. Is there an overlap in schemes?

A: There are a few similarities, but it’s a different terminology. I know when I got the call from the Broncos that they wanted me to work out, obviously I was excited. It’s a playoff team looking for a championship, and that’s the place you want to end up.

Q: You love music. How did you get so involved with producing and playing instruments?

A: I grew up listening to all types of music. I play piano, guitar, drums. I am self-taught. My family had a gospel group when I was growing up. My dad played the drums, and my cousins were singing. It’s in my family. I sing a little bit too. I produce my own music. Pretty much anything, but mostly R&B. I have a nice little setup (for a studio). I do a lot of stuff with (running back) Jonathan Stewart of the Carolina Panthers. I produce a lot of stuff with him.
