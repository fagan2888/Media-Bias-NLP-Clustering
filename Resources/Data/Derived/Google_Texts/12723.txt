WASHINGTON — Republican Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt told The Daily Caller that no Republican staffers participated in preparing the “clearly partisan” Senate Intelligence Committee report on CIA interrogation tactics used against al-Qaida suspects primarily during the Bush administration.

“I was on the Senate Intelligence Committee when the report was completed,” Blunt told TheDC after the Democratic committee leadership released a 500-page report summary on the same day that Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber testified before Congress.

“My predecessor, Sen. Bond, was the lead Republican on the Committee when the report was started. Sen. Bond’s determination early on was that this report was clearly a partisan effort, and there was no reason for the Republican staff to continue to participate,” Blunt said.

“So you have a report done by one party without interviewing any of the people involved. It’s basically just looking at the reports from the CIA themselves, without talking to the people involved, and then trying to make a story out of it.”
