ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) — Raeanna Johnson and the rest of her family didn’t know her 18-year-old brother Tyler was addicted to methamphetamine until after he committed suicide and his toxicology report came back.

“We had no idea,” said Johnson, 24, who’s representing Wisconsin in this year’s Miss America pageant.

She’s one of several contestants whose family tragedies have determined the public-service platform they chose for the competition. Hers is named after her brother: “Tyler’s Legacy: The Impact of Substance Abuse on The Family.”

She’s not alone. Miss Kansas Amanda Sasek’s father committed suicide when she was 17. Miss Delaware Brittany Lewis is still waiting for an arrest in her sister’s slaying.

The platforms outline a social or public-service cause that the contestants plan to pursue or publicize.

“Since his death, I’ve learned the science of and the effects of meth on the human body,” said Johnson, who hopes for a career in nonprofit development. “I am adamant about wanting to prevent tragedies like this from happening to other families.”

The contestants will talk about their platforms during the nationally televised pageant finale on Sunday night.

“All 53 contestants every year have something that motivates them toward their area of community service,” said Sam Haskell, CEO of the Miss America Organization. “The catalyst is usually something personal. I find it incredibly empowering for the contestants to talk about their issues. Through their own tragedies, they want to help others.”

Sasek’s platform as Miss Kansas is to help people find their strengths, in memory of her father.
