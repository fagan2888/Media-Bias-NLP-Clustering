SHNS photo.\n\nBaker wins GOP nomination, avoids primary fight\n\nNarrowly staves off Tea Part challenger Mark Fisher\n\nNarrowly staving off a potential primary from a Tea Party challenger, Republican candidate for governor Charlie Baker won a resounding endorsement from his party on Saturday, promising to improve education, partner with cities and towns and expand business opportunities.\n\nBaker, who four years ago was felled by Gov. Deval Patrick\u2019s re-election campaign, was back on the stage at his party\u2019s convention, accepting the overwhelming endorsement from the more than 2,500 delegates who traveled to Boston University\u2019s Agganis Arena.\n\nOnly a razor thin margin separated Mark Fisher, a Tea Party Republican from Shrewsbury, from qualifying for the ballot to challenge Baker for the Republican nomination in September, a possibility the Baker camp strove to avoid and which would have prevented party financial resources from flowing to either candidate until after the primary.\n\nThe ballot counting lasted hours after the convention adjourned as Fisher challenged some of the ballots, including at least four that he said we cast by a registered Democrat and unenrolled.\n\nFisher got 14.7 percent, needed 15\n\nFisher fell just short of the 15 percent of delegates he would have needed to qualify, according to party officials, capturing 14.7 percent of the 2,533 delegates present.\n\n\u201cPrimary or no primary, we\u2019re chasing 100 percent of the vote in November,\u201d Baker said.\n\nBaker and his running mate Karyn Polito, a former state representative who is also from Shrewsbury, emerged from the rather staid affair with the strong backing of the Republican Party as both offered themselves up as alternative to the one-party rule on Beacon Hill and eight years of Gov. Patrick. Recent troubles with the Department of Children and Families, the health exchange website, medical marijuana licensing and other issues provided ample fodder for Republicans throughout the day.\n\nBaker's chance for redemption for losing in 2010\n\nFor Baker, 2014 is his chance at redemption after losing in 2010 and feeling like he didn\u2019t put his best foot forward during that campaign. Baker hosted a women\u2019s breakfast early in the morning with Polito and his wife Lauren, interacting with a constituency that he failed to galvanize during his last run in 2010.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been successful because I am an optimist. I believe in this great state and I believe it\u2019s ready to soar but we aren\u2019t going anywhere if the powers on Beacon Hill protect the status quo,\u201d Baker said.\n\nBaker promised to fix the dysfunctional Obamacare health insurance exchange that has become an embarrassment for the Patrick administration, improve the business climate and tackle the educational achievement gap facing low-income and minority students. He also hit Patrick and Democrats for troubles at the Department of Children and Families, property taxes \u201crun amok,\u201d and a gas tax indexed to inflation that opponents are trying to repeal in November.\n\n\u201cThis is the problem with one-party rule. There\u2019s no accountability. No price to be paid for getting stale. No pushback. No urgency. No debate. Just the giant muddle of the status quo,\u201d Baker said. This isn\u2019t good enough for Massachusetts. Not your Massachusetts. Not mine. We can and must do better.\u201d\n\nFisher's message much different than Baker's\n\nBaker gave his acceptance speech to a considerably emptied arena. Many delegates left after casting their votes. The convention adjourned hours past its scheduled end time, and many who did remain were buzzing instead over whether Fisher had qualified for the ballot.\n\nFisher offered a far different message than Baker, eschewing the idea that the Republican Party should be a \u201cBig Tent\u201d party more accepting of differing viewpoints. He said the party establishment has become too \u201cliberal.\u201d\n\n\u201cBig Tents are for circuses and the Democrats have enough clowns parading as politicians to fill the biggest tent,\u201d Fisher said, promising to crack down on illegal immigration and fight for smaller government and against tax increases.\n\nThough the party endorsement heading into the convention was never in doubt, Baker faced the challenge of trying to appeal to and appease the more conservative party activists who were gravitating toward Fisher. With his former running mate Richard Tisei, who is running for Congress, boycotting the convention over the GOP platform on gay marriage, Baker steered clear of social issues.\n\n\u201cI know some of you here today don\u2019t agree with me here on everything and I get that and I respect that. I believe in the big tent of the Republican Party,\u201d he said.\n\nFisher pointed out that he is the only gubernatorial candidate who has taken a no-new-taxes pledge, but Baker also addressed taxes.\n\n\u201cWe need to get over this notion that state government\u2019s problem is revenue,\u201d said Baker. \u201cState government doesn\u2019t lack resources. It lacks imagination. There are faster, better, cheaper ways to get things done. And they must be identified and pursued.\u201d\n\nPolito wins Lt. Governor nomination\n\nPolito was nominated by Republican Governors Councilor Jennie Cassie and Rep. Viriato deMacedo, a Plymouth Republican running to take the seat held by retiring Senate President Therese Murray. DeMacedo was greeted with chants of \u201cVinny, Vinny!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe deserve a state government that reflects the conversations happening at our kitchen tables at home, a government that balances its checkbook, lives within its means and saves for the future,\u201d Polito said.\n\nPolito also faulted the Patrick administration for the state\u2019s 6.5 percent unemployment rate, and the ongoing controversy regarding the disappearance of a 5-year-old Fitchburg boy under state\u2019s watch. \u201cMay we never again see the day when an innocent child is lost in the care of our state, Polito said.\n\nThe convention also offered an opportunity for the party to showcase its candidates for other statewide offices, including treasurer, auditor, attorney general, secretary of state and U.S. Senate.\n\nPatricia Saint Aubin, a Norfolk state committeewoman and the Republican nominee for auditor, picked up where 2010 nominee Mary Connaughton left off during the last election cycle when she narrowly lost to Auditor Suzanne Bump.\n\nJust as Connaughton contrasted her professional experience with Bump\u2019s, Saint Aubin said, \u201cI have a dirty little secret, and that is I have a bachelors in accounting from Providence College and if that is not enough I have an even dirtier little secret than that. I have professionally audited.\u201d\n\nTreasurer candidate Mike Heffernan discussed his desire to boost local aid by running an efficient Lottery and pay down the state\u2019s long-term pension liability, while David D\u2019Arcangelo said he would fight for greater transparency on Beacon Hill.\n\nJohn Miller also became the GOP nominee for attorney general, while Brian Herr received the endorsement to take on U.S. Senate Edward Markey\n\nNational Republican Committeeman Ron Kaufman said Baker was not afraid of a primary but would benefit from avoiding a challenge because Massachusetts campaign finance laws make it harder for Republicans, who make up the minority of the electorate, to compete.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s preferable for one reason. We have the worst campaign finance laws in the country,\u201d Kaufman said, pointing to a $500 contribution limit coupled with the fact that primaries are late in the cycle and candidates cannot solicit maximum contributions for both the primary and the general as they can in other parts of the country.\n\nRep. Matthew Beaton, a Shrewsbury Republican who seconded Baker\u2019s nomination, said, \u201cWe must leave here united, ready to hit the ground running.\u201d\n\nThough the prevailing sentiment was that Baker would be better served by avoiding a primary, some wanted to see the contest.\n\nJim Morose, a Danvers delegate who planned to vote for Fisher, said voters deserved a primary, which the Republican Party has often sought to avoid, in order to air and debate different ideas. \u201cI just like competition. Whatever we\u2019ve been doing for the past 20 years hasn\u2019t been working, so why not try something different,\u201d Morose said.\n\nMorose said he would support Baker if he became the nominee, arguing that Baker would bring fiscal restraint to Beacon Hill.\n\nSome Republicans object to Baker's abortion and gay marriage position\n\nA smaller sample of Republicans said they would have trouble supporting Baker moving forward because of his positions on abortion and gay marriage. \u201cI\u2019d be sad if there isn\u2019t a primary. I can\u2019t support Baker,\u201d said Debbie Frame, a Warren Republican.\n\nSteve Aylward, a state committeeman who came to the convention uncommitted, said he was looking for either Baker or Fisher to show that they would fight the Democrats.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m tired of our guys backing down,\u201d said Aylward, who is behind the effort to repeal the gas tax indexing law at the ballot in November.\n\nAttorney General Martha Coakley\u2019s campaign manager Tim Foley sent out a fundraising email in the midst of the convention festivities: \u201cCharlie Baker\u2019s Republican party? They\u2019re celebrating their conservative views on equality and women\u2019s rights -- views that would move our state backward.\u201d\n\nMassGOP Chairwoman Kirsten Hughes accused Democrats of avoiding talking about and taking responsibility for the scandals at the Department of Children and Families and the state crime lab.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve turned to their usual tactic, smoke and mirrors, creating policies that sound good to the average voter, but don\u2019t amount to much. Their support for the minimum wage is a sad example, because it\u2019s not going to lift anyone out of poverty. Raising the minimum wage is not a jobs plan. It\u2019s political pandering,\u201d Hughes said.", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Charlie Baker wins Republican nomination for governor - again", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc4e5\"", "article_summary": "Republican nominee for governor Charles Baker addressing the crowd at the 2014 Republican Party convention yesterday in Boston.\nGovernor nominationPolito was nominated by Republican Governors Councilor Jennie Cassie and Rep.
