Re: “Loretta Sanchez for U.S. Senate” [Opinion, May 8]: Your glowing review extolling the virtues of Loretta Sanchez for the U.S. Senate failed to mention that she voted for Obamacare, as well as supporting the exemption from the Affordable Care Act for members of Congress. Considering this and many other Sanchez votes not included in your list, Sanchez is not the best choice to serve as U.S. senator.

I am shocked that the Register editors would support Sanchez, and it speaks volumes for how significantly the political stance of the editors have shifted over time.

We need a Southern Californian to replace Barbara Boxer in the Senate – and we have an experienced congresswoman as a candidate. Loretta Sanchez has worked hard for her constituents – and for California – for 20 years. She knows how the system works – and can and will work with other senators to solve our serious national issues.

Sen. Dianne Feinstein will undoubtedly complete her distinguished career soon – that would be the opportunity for Kamala Harris to run to represent Northern California.

I am not a Democrat, but will be voting for Loretta Sanchez in June ... and hopefully again in November.

Calle ‘required reading’

Re: “Appreciation for an anchor mom” [Opinion, May 8]: Fantastic piece by Brian Calle about the trials and tribulations his mom went through to get Brian and his sister the best education possible. This column should be required reading for every teachers union member.

What a great tribute to your mom, and to all hardworking mothers, many in dual-parental roles. I read it aloud to my husband, and paused several times to reread your incisive observations and conclusion.

Your column should be required reading at the U.S. Department of Education and boards of education throughout the U.S. Maybe you, Mr. Calle, will be the “instrument” of change.
