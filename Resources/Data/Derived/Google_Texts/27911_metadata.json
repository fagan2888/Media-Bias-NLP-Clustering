Welfare checks are inquiries into the well-being of a person, motivated by concern that they may pose a danger to themselves or others.\n\nCalifornia state Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson, whose district includes Isla Vista and who introduced the bill, said it would never be known for sure whether a gun database search then might have led to a different outcome in the case of Rodger.\n\n\"But the next time California experiences a similar tragedy, we shouldn't be left wondering,\" she said. \"Searches of the gun database can be done in as little as 90 seconds, and those 90 seconds can help save lives.\"\n\nThe bill requires law enforcement to search the California Department of Justice's Automated Firearms System database prior to conducting welfare checks on individuals to find out if they own a gun. Exceptions are made for \"exigent\" circumstances.\n\nRelated: Guns - When Politics Trumps Common Sense People Die\n\nThe state Senate voted 32-0 to approve the bill, which is expected to cost the state about $400,000 per year and now heads to California Governor Jerry Brown's desk.\n\nIt had been opposed by the California Association of Federal Firearms Licensees. Its president, Brandon Combs, said that in the last three days the association changed its stance to neutral/watch in response to amendments that were made to the bill.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The California Senate passed a bill\u00a0on Friday\u00a0requiring local law enforcement to searc", "title": "Gun Database Check Approved in California", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/08/24/Gun-Database-Check-Approved-California", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/12182012_bushmaster_ar15_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/08/24/Gun-Database-Check-Approved-California", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/12182012_bushmaster_ar15_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The California Senate passed a bill\u00a0on Friday\u00a0requiring local law enforcement to searc", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe23a5\"", "article_summary": "\"Searches of the gun database can be done in as little as 90 seconds, and those 90 seconds can help save lives.\"\nThe bill requires law enforcement to search the California Department of Justice's Automated Firearms System database prior to conducting welfare checks on individuals to find out if they own a gun.\nRelated: The Army's New Handgun - A Weapon for CriminalsLess than a month before the killings, local law enforcement carried out a \"welfare check\" on Rodger.\nCalifornia state Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson, whose district includes Isla Vista and who introduced the bill, said it would never be known for sure whether a gun database search then might have led to a different outcome in the case of Rodger.\nThe California Senate passed a bill on Friday requiring local law enforcement to search a database of firearms owners in most cases when carrying out checks on people who may harm themselves or others."}
