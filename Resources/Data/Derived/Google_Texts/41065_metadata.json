The third party of government is replacing the third party influence of insurers with a pernicious influence, Brase says.\n\nThe \u201cDoc Fix\u201d bill, to Brase, \u201cput doctors and patients in conflict,\u201d while being hailed as a recent legislative victory in bipartisan governance, with all but eight senators voting for it and all but 37 House Members voting for it. Unfortunately, Brase says this bill, the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, remedied a poor government reimbursement rate for doctors, but it came at a high cost.\n\nDangerous incentives that set up ethical conflicts between the doctor and patient were established, while strengthening Obamacare and the government\u2019s hands. Citing two new means by which doctors will be paid under this law, Brase says one of them \u2014 the Alternative Payment System \u2014 would provide a group of doctors with a lump sum payment for the year.\n\n\u201cPity you if you have a significant and expensive condition and it is November,\u201d she says. With a lump sum payment for their patients, doctors will suddenly have a \u201cconflict of interest\u201d with patients who may have unanticipated, expensive, difficult or complex medical needs \u2014 all because of government policy-makers who are lauded for a bipartisan accomplishment.\n\nObamacare\u2019s fraudulent salesmanship, made more clear by a key architect of the law, Jonathan Gruber, is discussed in the interview. Brase says we do not have health insurance anymore and our previously excellent system is being eroded. \u201cObamacare is really about bringing in the health plans as collaborators with the government to run the health care system that covers all expenses from the first dollar to the last and then calls it \u2018private coverage.\u2019 It really isn\u2019t. It is really about moving us to government health care, without it looking like government health care.\u201d\n\nShe calls the secret newborn screening happening in every state without true parental consent \u201cthe baby DNA warehousing\u201d issue. Few parents understand when blood is taken from their newborn and goes into the largest genetic testing program run by state governments. An expert on the controversial storage, use and dissemination of baby DNA, she frequently testifies and helps patients know their state laws with this website, ItsMyDNA.org.\n\nPrivacy in health care, she says, \u201cis about control. He who has the data makes the rules.\u201d Brase describes the people who want access to patient data in private records. This is expedited by requirements of use of the electronic health records, she says. Profiles will be made of you and your doctor, she says, and this will influence medical treatments and rationing, along with reimbursements to the doctor.\n\nBrase encourages patients to ask questions and warns that few realize that HIPPA, the law, is a grand deception as it does not protect your health privacy. Your signing the HIPPA form, which she discourages, can be used to demonstrate consent to share your personal data.\n\nAs for solutions, Twila Brase sees a future \u201cwedge of freedom\u201d that protects cash-based practices, and the ability of patients to find a doctor without an electronic health care record, so as not to be hampered by privacy invasions. She also describes a future when Americans won\u2019t be dependent on and relegated to Medicare after paying in all their life, and then losing choices and options just because they reach age 65.\n\nWATCH:\n\n\n\nFor more see CCHF\u2019s website, their Facebook and follow her on Twitter @TwilaBrase.\n\nMrs. Thomas does not necessarily support or endorse the products, services or positions promoted in any advertisement contained herein, and does not have control over or receive compensation from any advertiser.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Ginni Thomas", "description": "Medical Expert: 'The Power Of The Doctor Is Becoming Subsumed By The Government'", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "As America hears of more doctors leaving the profession, the head of a patient-centered national health care organization based in St. Paul, Minnesota, sees both political parties in Washington making", "title": "Medical Expert: \u2018The Power Of The Doctor Is Becoming Subsumed By The Government\u2019", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2015/06/14/medical-expert-the-power-of-the-doctor-is-becoming-subsumed-by-the-government/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/doctor-e1428005898208.jpg", "height": 501}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Medical Expert: 'The Power Of The Doctor Is Becoming Subsumed By The Government'", "title": "Medical Expert: \u2018The Power Of The Doctor Is Becoming Subsumed By The Government\u2019 Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2015/06/14/medical-expert-the-power-of-the-doctor-is-becoming-subsumed-by-the-government/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/doctor-e1428005898208.jpg"}, "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-06-14 10:30:01", "sailthru.title": "Medical Expert: 'The Power Of The Doctor Is Becoming Subsumed By The Government'", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "health-care,ginni-thomas", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "health care", "sailthru.description": "As America hears of more doctors leaving the profession, the head of a patient-centered national health care organization based in St. Paul, Minnesota, sees both political parties in Washington making", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/doctor-e1428005898208.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Profiles will be made of you and your doctor, she says, and this will influence medical treatments and rationing, along with reimbursements to the doctor.\nPrivacy in health care, she says, \u201cis about control.\nDangerous incentives that set up ethical conflicts between the doctor and patient were established, while strengthening Obamacare and the government\u2019s hands.\n\u201cThe power of the doctor is becoming subsumed by the government.\u201dAmerica is moving, from Brase\u2019s perspective, from the charitable human \u201cmission of medicine\u201d to a cold, sterile \u201cbusiness of health care.\u201d Doctors face increasing \u201cethical dilemmas\u201d as their Hippocratic Oath requires them to do no harm to their patient and keep confidence.\nWith a lump sum payment for their patients, doctors will suddenly have a \u201cconflict of interest\u201d with patients who may have unanticipated, expensive, difficult or complex medical needs \u2014 all because of government policy-makers who are lauded for a bipartisan accomplishment."}
