Some have to do with food safety, some are more a matter of personal preference.\n\nJia broke down the meanings one by one.\n\nFor starters, \u201cnatural doesn\u2019t mean organic,\u201d she said.\n\nSlapping the word \u201cnatural\u201d on a product may be good marketing but the definition of the term, when it comes to food products, is unclear. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has no official definition, but generally accepts products as natural that contain no added color, artificial flavors or synthetic substances.\n\nOrganic, while not regulated by the FDA, is regulated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and has to do with how the food is grown or raised, Jia said.\n\n\u201cFor myself, I purchase organic fruit, organic meat for my kids,\u201d she said. She worries about taxing their young livers and kidneys with the task of removing chemicals from food.\n\nStudies of organic food have found no nutritional benefit to organic over non-organic, in terms of vitamins and minerals, though a 2014 analysis published in the British Journal of Nutrition reported higher levels of antioxidants in organic plants. The real benefit of organic food is less about nutrients, said Rutgers-Camden professor Charlotte Markey, and more about reduced exposure to pesticides.\n\nWhile organic food generally means that no pesticides or chemicals were used, Markey said, the exact meaning can vary from place to place.\n\nNew Jersey adheres to the USDA standards when it comes to certified organic food. Certain natural pesticides are permitted under these standards, with a complete list of allowable and non-allowable substances easily available online for consumers seeking transparency.\n\nTransparency is the main reason Campbell came out in favor of labeling for genetically modified organisms last summer. While many consumers have embraced non-GMO foods, and individual states are working on legislation regarding labeling on foods with GMOs, Campbell felt there should be federal legislation for GMOs.\n\n\u201cWe manufacture in several locations across the country,\u201d said Mark Alexander, the president of the Americas simple meals and beverages division of Campbell. To keep up with the required GMO labeling standards in each and every state where they distribute, he said, \u201cIt would be extremely difficult, if not impossible.\u201d\n\nThe company believes GMOs are safe, Alexander said. \u201cIf they weren\u2019t safe, we wouldn\u2019t have them in our products.\u201d\n\nThe FDA backs up the safety of GMOs, and notes that genetically engineered (GE) plants are required to meet the same safety criteria as non-GE plants.\n\nMostly, Alexander said, their customers just want to know what it in the food they buy.\n\n\u201cWhat we find is consumers would generally prefer to have more information rather than less.\u201d\n\nCampbell created a guide, whatsinmyfood.com, to explain each ingredient in their products to their customers. In America, the site says, \u201capproximately 90 percent of all canola, corn, soybean and sugar beet crops are grown from genetically modified seeds.\u201d These are common ingredients, making it tough to avoid GMOs.\n\n\u201cThe food system in this country decided to accept GMO technology a number of decades ago,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cIt\u2019s ingrained in our overall food system. What we have found is the more we can inform consumers on this topic, the more they understand.\u201d\n\nFor those who don\u2019t want GMOs in their food, Alexander said, they have the organic Campbell products, which are non-GMO by definition. Organic is non-GMO, but non-GMO crops are not always organic.\n\nAnd organic, non-GMO and natural foods are not always healthy by default.\n\n\u201cThe only labels that really are completely legitimate are the required labels,\u201d Markey said. \u201cAny other label is really a form of advertising more than anything else.\u201d\n\nThose required labels are the nutrition facts and the ingredients list. And the nutrition facts matter, Jia said.\n\n\u201cA bag of chips made from a natural or organic potato, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s healthier than the chips made from a regular potato.\u201d\n\nWhat you want to look at, Jia said, is the portion size, the amount of fat and, in particular, saturated and trans fats. The sodium level, especially in processed food, is also important, particularly for those with high blood pressure or heart disease.\n\nIn animal products, she added, it is important to consider the use of antibiotics or hormones.\n\nOther labels can also be unclear. For instance, \u201ccage-free\u201d eggs mean the chickens producing those eggs weren\u2019t in a cage, Jia said, but it doesn\u2019t tell you where they were, or how crowded those conditions were.\n\n\u201cLowfat\u201d is \u201ca relative term,\u201d she said. It means the product may have less fat than the conventional version of the product, but not in comparison with other foods.\n\nLow-sodium foods are good for you, Jia said, but only if there is naturally less sodium. Check the ingredients list, just in case. \u201cSometimes they use potassium chloride and that\u2019s worse,\u201d Jia said.\n\nGluten-free options are a popular choice these days, and not just for those with celiac disease, a gluten intolerance. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, rye and barley, Jia said, and the term \u201cgluten-free\u201d does have FDA standards, because gluten is considered an allergen.\n\nChoosing gluten-free options could help you avoid starchy food, Jia said, but it is not necessarily healthier. Likewise, sugar-free could still cause blood sugar to rise, as those items may have substituted other carbohydrates for sugar.\n\nWhole grains are important in any food product.\n\n\u201cAnytime they have the whole grain label it means they have fiber,\u201d Jia said. \u201cIt will slow down the digestibility of the food.\u201d\n\nWhen special labels lead to higher prices, that can also affect the actions of the customer.\n\n\u201cThe notion that we would all be able to make the most nutritious choice ignores the fact that only affluent consumers have those choices,\u201d Cairns said. Further complicating the matter, her research has shown that while there is societal pressure to care about what is in your food, caring too much also carries a stigma.\n\n\u201cYou can be seen as elitist and too controlling,\u201d she said.\n\nIt takes work to be an informed food shopper, Cairns said, not just looking at labels, but researching what those labels mean online.\n\nThink about why you want to take certain labels into consideration, Markey recommended. \u201cThere\u2019s a variety of reasons why we label food. We want people to make good food choices and they can\u2019t unless they know what is in what they are eating.\u201d\n\nFor more information\n\nTo learn about food safety and food labeling guidelines, visit usda.gov and fda.gov.\n\nLearn about Campbell\u2019s ingredients at whatsinmyfood.com and the GMO announcement is available at campbellsoupcompany.com.\n\nFind out more about Kate Cairn\u2019s research in her book \u201cFood and Femininity,\u201d available at bloomsbury.com/us/food-and-femininity-9780857855565/\n\nRead or Share this story: http://tnsne.ws/1SkIKAe", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "The grocery store can be difficult to navigate these days.
