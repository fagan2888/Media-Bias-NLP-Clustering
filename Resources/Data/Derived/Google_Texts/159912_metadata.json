The Judge rejected arguments that the man\u2019s claims are preempted by the Federal Insecticide Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA).\n\nHardeman claims to have used Roundup regularly since the 1980s to control poison oak and weeds on his property, but the weed killer lacked proper warnings of the dangers it posed to human health and was generally \u201cunfit and unsuitable to be marketed and sold in commerce,\u201d according to his complaint.\n\nMonsanto\u2019s arguments for a dismissal of Edward Hardeman\u2019s lawsuit looking to hold Monsanto responsible for his 2015 diagnosis of non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma failed. U.S. District Court Judge Vince Chhabria found Hardeman\u2019s state failure-to-warn claims were valid and are not preempted by the act.\n\nWhile Judge Chhabria admitted California law \u201ccan sometimes\u201d allow a manufacturer to escape liability when a warning would be unreasonable, Hardeman\u2019s claims arise out of FIFRA\u2019s stricter provision requiring an \u201cadequate\u201d warning, without regard to reasonableness.\n\n\u201cIn this light, it\u2019s hard to see how Hardeman\u2019s failure-to-warn claims could \u2018be construed more broadly than\u2019 FIFRA,\u201d the Judge said. \u201cIndeed, Hardeman\u2019s complaint explicitly bases his California-law failure-to-warn claims on Monsanto\u2019s alleged violation of FIFRA.\u201d\n\nMonsanto also argued that Hardeman\u2019s failure-to-warn claims are again preempted because the Environmental Protection Agency has approved Roundup\u2019s product labels. Judge Chhabria said that approval does not prohibit private litigation on FIFRA.\n\n\u201cThe mere fact that the EPA has approved a product label does not prevent a jury from finding that the same label violates FIFRA,\u201d the Judge said.\n\nJudge Chhabria also rejected Monsanto\u2019s claim that Hardeman cannot continue with his strict liability claim because Hardeman is claiming Roundup did not have the warning it should have, according to the order.\n\nMoreover, Hardeman claims Monsanto knew of Roundup\u2019s carcinogenic properties since shortly after it was first developed in 1974 and also cited the World Health Organization International Agency for Research on Cancer\u2019s 2015 study designating glyphosate as an herbicide \u201cprobably carcinogenic to humans.\u201d\n\nDue to IARC\u2019s findings, the California Environmental Protection Agency announced that it would officially list glyphosate as a known carcinogen under the state\u2019s Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986.\n\nMonsanto has since filed suit against the state agency, claiming its right to due process had been violated by the proposal.\n\nThe multinational company is facing a number of other suits over the allegedly cancer-causing nature of Roundup, mainly in California.\n\nEnrique Rubio and Yolanda Mendoza allege that agricultural and residential use of Roundup caused Rubio to develop multiple myeloma and Mendoza to develop non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, but Monsanto has also claimed the suit is preempted by FIFRA.\n\nThe company made similar arguments in December 2015 against former coffee grower Christine Sheppard\u2019s liability suit over her non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma.\n\nSource: Monsanto\u2019s FIFRA Stance Can\u2019t Nix Roundup Cancer Suit\n\nJoin the Discussion", "article_metadata": {"generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "Consuella Pachico", "og": {"site_name": "Legal Reader", "description": "A California Federal Judge has refused to dismiss a liability suit against\u00a0Monsanto Co., filed by a man claiming his cancer stems from longtime use of the carcinogen-laced weed killer Roundup.
