Ted Poe from Wikipedia.\n\nText of a bill by Rep. Ted Poe, R-Texas, to delay the switch to ICD-10 diagnostic coding surfaced on Monday, in which it requests further study on the disruption on healthcare providers could face resulting from the replacement of ICD-9.\n\nThe three-page bill, H.R. 2126, was proposed on April 30 but the text was not posted for over a week.\n\nThe bill would prohibit the Secretary of Health and Human Services from replacing ICD-9 with ICD-10 on Oct. 1, as is scheduled. It has been referred to the Committees on Energy and Commerce, and Ways and Means, with no guarantee that it will be heard by either committee.\n\nIt asks for a study by the Comptroller General of the United States, in consultation with stakeholders in the medical community, to conduct a study to identify steps that can be taken to mitigate the disruption ICD-10 would have on healthcare providers.\n\n[Also: ICD-10 advocates blast bill to block switch]\n\nThe bill stipulates that not later than six months after the date of enactment, the Comptroller General submit to each House of Congress a report on the study and include recommendations for legislative and administrative steps appropriate to mitigate the disruption.\n\n\u201cThis Act may be cited as the \u2018Cutting Costly Codes Act of 2015,\u2019\u201d according to the bill\u2019s text.\n\nPrevious delays have held up implementation of ICD-10, but most healthcare providers support implementation.\n\nThe American Medical Association, however, backs an ICD-10 delay, calling the switch a burden to physicians that takes away from their focus on care. It is also costly to implement, and that will result in lost reimbursement as ICD-10 adds thousands of billing codes, the AMA said.\n\nThe bill has six co-sponsors: Blake Farenthold, R-Texas; Mike Rogers, R-Alabama; Mo Brooks, R- Alabama; Morgan Griffith, R-Virginia; Tom Price, R-Georgia; and David Roe, R-Tennessee.\n\nTwitter: @SusanMorseHFN", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/icd-10-bill-surfaces-calls-delay-more-study-rollout-disruptions", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/Ted-Poe-wiki-feature.gif", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Text of a bill by Rep.
