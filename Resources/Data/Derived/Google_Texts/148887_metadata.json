Print (online is considered \u201cprint\u201d) is in the back. Video, even for smallish web sites, is king, and people with huge cameras and tripods get the prime real estate at the beginning of the line.\n\nA publicist taped 8.5\u2019\u2019 by 11\u2019\u2019 printer paper on the floor with the names of our outlets, where we were to stand for the next hour or so. There must have been at least 40 pieces of paper on the floor, each about an inch or two apart \u2014 bad news for anyone who was more than 11\u2019\u2019 wide.\n\nBut, like summer camp bunkmates, red carpet reporters have long figured out that the whole process is smoother if you\u2019re friendly with the people around you. (Also, please have good breath!). Small talk transforms from a necessary evil to a necessary necessity; it\u2019s impossible and weird to not talk to someone whose nose hairs are brushing the top of your head.\n\nSure, there are characters (one woman told me she was famous for her interviewing abilities, while another man yelled at a reporter who asked a celeb an extra question), and people reveal their quirks almost immediately due to the inherent weirdness of the situation they\u2019re placed in. But when I mentioned this was my first time covering a red carpet event, one woman next to me talked over her questions and then reviewed mine with me, giving me pointers and asking for feedback from me.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The real action at a red carpet event is on the other side of that rope", "title": "What it\u2019s like to be a red carpet reporter at Sundance", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The real action at a red carpet event is on the other side of that rope", "title": "What it\u2019s like to be a red carpet reporter at Sundance", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/01/18/what_its_like_to_be_a_red_carpet_reporter_at_sundance/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/unnamed.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The real action at a red carpet event is on the other side of that rope", "title": "What it\u2019s like to be a red carpet reporter at Sundance", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/unnamed.jpg", "creator": "@prachigu", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Prachi Gupta", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, christina hendricks, gods pocket, john slattery, Journalism, Movies, Philip Seymour Hoffman, red carpet, sundance 2014", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "But, like summer camp bunkmates, red carpet reporters have long figured out that the whole process is smoother if you\u2019re friendly with the people around you.\nBut when I mentioned this was my first time covering a red carpet event, one woman next to me talked over her questions and then reviewed mine with me, giving me pointers and asking for feedback from me.\nUnbeknownst to me \u2014 but well-known to every other reporter who has done this before \u2014 there is a hierarchy in this line based on what medium you work for.\nPrint (online is considered \u201cprint\u201d) is in the back.\nSmall talk transforms from a necessary evil to a necessary necessity; it\u2019s impossible and weird to not talk to someone whose nose hairs are brushing the top of your head."}
