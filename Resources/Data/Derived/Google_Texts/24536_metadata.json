On Friday, after an optional practice, he disclosed he was going to reunite Alex Tanguay and Jarome Iginila as linemates, with John Mitchell centering them.\n\nAfter the morning skate, the Avalanche coach disclosed that another of the changes was due to injury.\n\nVeteran winger Jack Skille, who has been skating on the fourth line with Mitchell and Cody McLeod, suffered a concussion against Dallas Thursday night. \u201cHe had an elbow to the head by one of their players,\u201d Roy said.\n\nHow long will Skille be out?\n\n\u201cI have no idea,\u201d Roy said. \u201cYou know how it is (with) the protocol sometimes. Hopefully, it won\u2019t be that long.\u201d\n\nWith Skille out and Mitchell stepping between Iginla and Tanguay, the other lines shaked out this way: Gabe Landeskog-Carl Soderberg-Blake Comeau, Mikhail Grigorenko-Nathan MacKinnon-Matt Duchene and Cody McLeod-Chris Wagner-Andreas Martinsen. Colorado has been carrying only one extra forward, so with Skille out, it\u2019s likely one will be recalled from San Antonio in the next few days.\n\nOn defense, Andrew Bodnarchuk will be back in the lineup against the Jets after eight healthy scratches in the last 10 games, and Zach Redmond is slated to join Nate Guenin as the healthy scratches.\n\nThe Jets arrived in Denver in the early morning hours Saturday after losing 5-3 to Carolina and finishing a six-game homestand with a 1-5 record. The slump/collapse has dropped the Jets to nine points out of a playoff spot.\n\nTerry Frei: tfrei@denverpost.com or @TFrei", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Jack Skille out for Avalanche with concussion", "title": "Jack Skille out for Avalanche with concussion", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/02/06/jack-skille-out-for-avalanche-with-concussion/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160206__skillep1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160206__skillep1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-06T13:06:32+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-18T05:48:39+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Veteran winger Jack Skille, who has been skating on the fourth line with Mitchell and Cody McLeod, suffered a concussion against Dallas Thursday night.\nAfter the morning skate, the Avalanche coach disclosed that another of the changes was due to injury.\nThe Jets arrived in Denver in the early morning hours Saturday after losing 5-3 to Carolina and finishing a six-game homestand with a 1-5 record.\nPatrick Roy is tweaking his lines for The Big Game Saturday night against Winnipeg.\nOn Friday, after an optional practice, he disclosed he was going to reunite Alex Tanguay and Jarome Iginila as linemates, with John Mitchell centering them."}
