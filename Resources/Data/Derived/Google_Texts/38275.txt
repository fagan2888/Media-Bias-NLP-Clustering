A number of GOP presidential candidates are in Iowa Saturday for the 15th annual Iowa Faith and Freedom Coalition's Fall Family Dinner.

A total of six presidential contenders will speak in front of the crowd at the Paul R. Knapp Learning Center at the Iowa State Fairgrounds for an event aimed at helping caucusgoers learn more about the GOP candidates.

Confirmed speakers are U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, former New York Gov. George Pataki, former U.S. Sen. Rick Santorum and businessman Donald Trump.

The Iowa Faith & Freedom Coalition is an organization aimed at educating Christians in order to advance limited government, lower taxes and protect the sanctity of life and marriage.

The event starts at 5:30 p.m., and KCCIâ€™s Rose Heaphy will have a LIVE report on KCCI 8 News at 10.
