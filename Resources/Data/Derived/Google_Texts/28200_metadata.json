There I learned about the decades\u2019 worth of research into the effectiveness of psychotherapy for virtually any disorder. Since then, I\u2019ve been telling anyone who will listen \u2014 psychotherapy works!\n\nAnd now with the implementation of the mental health parity act and the Affordable Care Act, psychotherapy will become even more affordable to anyone who wants to give it a try. So why not try it?\n\nPsychotherapy is suffering a decline in usage in the past decade. Yet the research tells us psychotherapy is often more effective than medications in helping patients relieve the symptoms of common mental disorders, like depression, anxiety and bipolar disorder.\n\nAs Horvath (2013) wrote earlier this year, there is no question whether psychotherapy is effective or not: \u201cThe impact of the first meta-analysis, and those that followed, was multidirectional and far-reaching. To a large extent, the question whether psychotherapy \u2014 as such \u2014 is effective is no longer debated.\u201d Put simply \u2014 it works.\n\nToo often today, people first turn to a medication, and then to psychotherapy. What I argued back in 2008 is still true today \u2014 psychotherapy goes along with medication. Always. For virtually every disorder, and every individual, psychotherapy will enhance and speed up the process of recovery and healing from mental illness.\n\nForgo psychotherapy, and you\u2019re getting half the treatment effectiveness, which will more often than not take twice as long. I\u2019m not just make this up\u2026 Glick (2004) cites multiple studies that clearly demonstrate psychotherapy\u2019s value in conjunction with medication: \u201cThe Barlow et al. study on panic disorder [for instance] showed that following drug alone, about 85 percent of patients relapsed, but only 15 relapsed when they had psychotherapy plus drug.\u201d\n\nPsychotherapy works as a first-line treatment for many common mental disorders, including most forms of depression. Psychotherapy is effective and time-limited when wielded by an experienced therapist.\n\nBut it\u2019s important to find the right therapist \u2014 one you can form a good, professional working relationship with. In the field, they call this forming a strong therapeutic alliance. And in such relationships, you\u2019ll find good patient outcomes according to Horvath (2013): \u201cOne of the most important research finding is that alliance, measured as early as between the third and fifth session, is a reliable prognosticator of therapy outcome.\u201d\n\nJust like you may not find the right contractor when you go to build a deck on the back of your house, or the right hair stylist when you go to get a haircut, you may not find the right therapist on your first try. It\u2019s important to recognize that the therapist works for you \u2014 so it is in your best interests to find one you feel comfortable with and helps you bring about changes in your life and thinking.\n\nIn short, psychotherapy works. So why not try it?\n\nThis post is written in honor of National Psychotherapy Day, \u201ca day when clinicians, clients, and therapy advocates will unite to promote the profession, fight stigma, educate the public, and draw attention to the needs of community mental health.\u201d I hope you\u2019ll join us!\n\nReferences\n\nHorvath, AO.
