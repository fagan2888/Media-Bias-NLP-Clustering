Their triumphs have lifted our spirits, and have lifted our nation, and have left us in a better and richer place.\"\n\nThe honorees will sit with Obama and first lady Michelle Obama at the Kennedy Center ceremony Sunday night. The event will be broadcast Dec. 29 on CBS from 9 to 11 p.m.\n\nSecretary of State John Kerry hosted the honorees Saturday night for a black-tie dinner at the State Department.\n\nThe Honors, which have been awarded since the late 1970s, go to those in the performing arts for their contribution to American culture. More than 150 artists have received the award.\n\nWalter Cronkite was known to host the Honors until 2002. Caroline Kennedy, who now serves as U.S. ambassador to Japan, succeeded Cronkite as a host.\n\nActor Dustin Hoffman, TV host David Letterman, and three members of Led Zeppelin were among seven people who were honored last year.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "\"Their triumphs have lifted our spirits,\" Obama said at White House.", "description": "\"Their triumphs have lifted our spirits,\" Obama said at White House.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Blog Briefing Room"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "\"Their triumphs have lifted our spirits,\" Obama said at White House.", "title": "Obama welcomes 'brilliant' 2014 Kennedy Center honorees", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/192426-obama-receives-2014-kennedy-center-honorees", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-12-09T12:55:07-05:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2013-12-09T12:55-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/192426-obama-receives-2014-kennedy-center-honorees", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2013-12-08T17:54-05:00", "dcterms.creator": "Rebecca Shabad", "author": "Rebecca Shabad", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-08T17:54:11-05:00", "modified_time": "2013-12-09T12:55:07-05:00"}, "keywords": "Kennedy Center Honors,Barack Obama,Kennedy Center", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/192426-obama-receives-2014-kennedy-center-honorees", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "\"Their triumphs have lifted our spirits,\" Obama said at White House.", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama welcomes 'brilliant' 2014 Kennedy Center honorees"}, "dcterms.title": "Obama welcomes 'brilliant' 2014 Kennedy Center honorees"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf35c\"", "article_summary": "President Obama welcomed this year\u2019s Kennedy Center Honorees to the White House Sunday evening, ahead of the ceremony at the Kennedy Center.\nThe honorees will sit with Obama and first lady Michelle Obama at the Kennedy Center ceremony Sunday night.\nADVERTISEMENT\u201cEach of our brilliant honorees has given us something unique and of richness beyond measure,\u201d Obama said at the White House.\nTheir triumphs have lifted our spirits, and have lifted our nation, and have left us in a better and richer place.\"\nCaroline Kennedy, who now serves as U.S. ambassador to Japan, succeeded Cronkite as a host."}
