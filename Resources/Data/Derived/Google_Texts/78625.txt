The state’s Insurance Division has released an information sheet providing comparisons of existing health insurance plans compared to those provided under President Obama’s Affordable Care Act.

Hawai`i officials said the information sheet will show premiums offered by Hawaii Medical Services Association (HMSA) and Kaiser Hawaii both on and off the Hawaii Health Connector, the state’s online health insurance marketplace.

Hawaii Insurance Commissioner Gordon Ito recently asked insurers to extend non-ACA compliant plans into next year. This follows the decision by President Obama to allow individuals to keep their existing 2013 insurance plans in 2014 even if the plans do not meet ACA requirements.

HMSA and Kaiser Hawaii will continue 2013 individual plans, the division said in a statement Tuesday.

All five insurers (HMSA, Kaiser, Hawaii Medical Assurance Association, University Health Alliance, and Family Health Hawaii) will also be offering ACA plans for small businesses, subject to the Insurance Division’s approval. HMSA and Kaiser will continue to offer their non-ACA-compliant 2013 plans for individuals.

“Using that premium sheet, consumers and small businesses can compare their ACA plan premiums to the premiums for their existing 2013 plans plus add an increase to their 2013 plans of about 8 percent to 10 percent,” Ito said.

Obamacare-compliant plans can be purchased through the Hawaii Health Connector or directly from an insurer. However, the state is reminding consumers and small businesses that only ACA-compliant plans purchased through the Hawaii Health Connector will be eligible for tax credits.

Non-compliant 2013 health insurance plans cannot be purchased through the Hawaii Health Connector.

For the state’s small businesses, Hawaii’s Prepaid Healthcare Act requirements must continue to be met, officials said
