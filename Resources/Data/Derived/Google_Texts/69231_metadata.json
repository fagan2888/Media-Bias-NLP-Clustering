(Facebook)\n\nActor and activist George Takei released a video on Wednesday on his Facebook page urging fellow supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) to unite behind fellow Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.\n\n\u201cUltimately, we Democrats know that a bit of a tussle isn\u2019t a bad thing \u2014 it makes us stronger. Keeps us sharp,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd really, it\u2019s like a family squabble, where only family \u2014 those very close to us \u2014 can truly get under our skin. But remember this, too: it\u2019s precisely because we like and respect each other that the words and criticisms sting as much as they do.\u201d\n\nTakei released the video a day after Clinton scored victories in four out of five primaries over Sanders. The Star Trek and Allegiance star had voiced his support for Sanders earlier in the campaign.\n\nIn the video, he noted that both candidates agree on issues like womens\u2019 reproductive health, LGBT rights advocacy, separation of church and state and supporting the Affordable Care Act. He also recalled Sanders\u2019 statement last November that if Clinton won the general election, she would be \u201can infinitely better candidate and President than the Republican candidate on his best day.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf Bernie believes that, his supporters can, too,\u201d Takei said.\n\nTakei did, however, rebut a fan\u2019s suggestion that he serve as vice president, saying that the position wouldn\u2019t give him \u201cas much time for cat memes,\u201d as seen below:\n\nWatch Takei\u2019s remarks, as posted online on Wednesday, below.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/George-Takei-042716-800x430.jpg", "height": 430}, "title": "George Takei urges fellow Sanders supporters: Abandon \u2018family squabble\u2019 and back Clinton"}, "fb": {"app_id": 212555972273585}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "article_summary": "George Takei releases a video for fellow Bernie Sanders supporters on April 27, 2016.\n(Facebook)Actor and activist George Takei released a video on Wednesday on his Facebook page urging fellow supporters of Sen.
