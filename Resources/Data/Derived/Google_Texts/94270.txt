Energy drinks are considered a public health hazard, a catalyst for unhealthy behaviors, even drugs — but what about for the people who rarely, if ever, drink them? Would they actually be effective?

BuzzFeed put three popular energy drinks to the test: Monster, Red Bull, and 5-Hour Energy. Before being given a drink, employees were tested on their reaction time and working memory. After they finished their drink, they were tested again 20 minutes and five hours later to measure the effects.

Twenty minutes after drinking Monster, employees felt hot and like they were talking faster. Their reaction time and memory increased on average by 12 percent. But five hours later, despite still feeling “amped up,” they scored five percent lower on their tests. Five-Hour Energy delivered similar results, increasing test scores by eight percent after 20 minutes. And their scores were still five percent better when tested hours after the fact.

While Red Bull worked much like Monster, hours later employees felt increasingly more scatter-brained, forgetful, and lethargic. To function as a control, employees also took the tests when drinking only water. There was a 0.3 percent increase in scores 20 minutes later, while there was a 0.6 percent decrease five hours later. So if all four drinks were ranked, Five-Hour Energy is followed by Monster, Red Bull, and water.
