The hospital also says the fetus inside Mu\u00f1oz is \"not viable.\"\n\nFor weeks, hospital officials had said she isn\u2019t dead and that her condition is serious.\n\nBut in a new court filing, the hospital states that Mu\u00f1oz met the clinical criteria for brain death on Nov. 28, two days after she was found unconscious at her Haltom City home.\n\nMarlise Mu\u00f1oz's husband, Erick, sued the hospital last week to have her removed from life support. He has said he and his wife are paramedics who agreed they would not want life support in this situation. This week, attorneys for Erick Mu\u00f1oz released a statement describing the fetus as \"distinctly abnormal,\" with heart problems, deformed lower extremities and hydrocephalus, or water on the brain.\n\nHospital officials have said Texas law prohibits them from following Marlise Mu\u00f1oz's wishes because she is pregnant. John Peter Smith Hospital has refused to disconnect Mu\u00f1oz from life-support machines, citing the Texas Advance Directives Act concerning end-of-life care. It includes this provision: \"A person may not withdraw or withhold life-sustaining treatment under this subchapter from a pregnant patient.\"\n\nInside the hearing\n\nDuring Friday's hearing in Fort Worth before State District Judge R.H. Wallace, attorneys for Mu\u00f1oz said that the matter is not a pro-life or pro-choice argument, but it\u2019s turned into that.\n\nMu\u00f1oz\u2019s attorneys said the hospital continues to misapply the part of the state law that says a pregnant woman on life support must stay on life support. The attorneys insist that Mu\u00f1oz is dead and that the law does not apply to a dead person.\n\nJPS attorneys say that the hospital is interpreting the law correctly and that the state has an overriding interest to protect the life of the unborn child.\n\nMu\u00f1oz\u2019s lawyers say the situation creates a potential slippery slope. They asked: What will happen to women who die or face death in the future \u2013 will they be given blood tests to determine if they are pregnant and then placed on life support?\n\nMu\u00f1oz\u2019s family members were at the hearing, including her husband, Erick.\n\nWhat the hospital says\n\nNew court documents filed by JPS late Thursday shed more light on the hospital's perspective. Upon arriving at the Fort Worth hospital, Marlise Mu\u00f1oz was alive, JPS says in the documents. She was experiencing cardiac arrest and respiratory failure. She was 14 weeks pregnant at the time.\n\n\u201cJPS, therefore, began life sustaining treatment,\u201d the hospital says in the documents. \u201cMs. Mu\u00f1oz did not have a written advanced directive and was incapable of communication.\u201d\n\nThe response continues: \u201cDespite such treatment, Ms. Mu\u00f1oz met the clinical criteria for brain death on November 28, 2013.\u201d\n\nIn the family's lawsuit, attorneys for Erick Mu\u00f1oz had stated that his wife had \u201clost all activity in her brain stem, and was for all purposes brain dead.\" Erick Mu\u00f1oz also saw \u201cbrain dead\u201d listed in writing in her medical charts.\n\nBut regarding Erick Mu\u00f1oz\u2019s position that since his wife is dead, she should no longer receive life-sustaining treatment, the hospital\u2019s Thursday filing stated:\n\n\u201cHis position, however, ignores consideration of the unborn child. [State law] Section 166.049 must convey legislative intent to protect the unborn child, otherwise the legislature would have simply allowed a pregnant patient to decide to let her life, and the life of her unborn child, end. ... \"If the legislature intended for life sustaining treatment to be withdrawn, allowing the unborn child to die, it could have expressed this intent by adding a second sentence to section 166.049 to the effect that, upon the mother's death, the healthcare providers must withdraw life sustaining treatment and let the unborn child die. It did not so provide.\"\n\nA medical ethicist's opinion\n\nFor a recent story on the Mu\u00f1oz situation, KERA\u2019s Lauren Silverman spoke with SMU Law professor and medical ethicist Tom Mayo.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve heard of a hospital insisting on treatment over the objection of a family,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is more of an ethical issue than a legal issue I think.\u201d\n\nMayo says it is not illegal for a doctor to withdraw life support on a pregnant patient in Texas.\n\nMayo tells NPR he believes the exclusion \"doesn't apply because I don't think the act applies to someone who is dead. This is all assuming now that the husband has it right, and that we'll see confirmation of her brain death as a result of the hearing.\"\n\nMayo says more than 30 other states also have pregnancy exclusion provisions on the books, but this is the first time he's heard of a hospital insisting on treatment over the objection of a family.\n\nA doctor's thoughts\n\n\"Knowing of these abnormalities this early in gestation, the likelihood of having a good outcome for the fetus is definitely decreased,\" says Dr. Sheila Chhutani, an OB-GYN at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas.\n\nShe says cases of pregnant brain-dead women are extremely rare. A 2010 study at Heidelberg University in Germany focused on a number of such women around the world. The results for the babies were mixed: five died in utero, and 13 were delivered by cesarean section, one of whom died a month later.\n\nChhutani says \"in dealing with these types of cases, one of the first things is finding out if there are any abnormalities within the fetus, because that can help determine whether or not you take on the burden of keeping this woman alive in order to grow the fetus.\"\n\nPrevious coverage\n\nFor previous coverage on the Marlise Mu\u00f1oz matter, read the stories below:", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health/Science", "description": "A state district judge has ruled that Marlise Mu\u00f1oz, the brain-dead North Texas woman who\u2019s 22 weeks pregnant, must be removed from life support by 5 p.m.", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://keranews.org/post/judge-orders-pregnant-brain-dead-north-texas-woman-removed-life-support", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/kera/files/styles/medium/public/201401/7137_4779168673539_904591559_n.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A state district judge has ruled that Marlise Mu\u00f1oz, the brain-dead North Texas woman who\u2019s 22 weeks pregnant, must be removed from life support by 5 p.m.", "title": "Judge Orders Pregnant, Brain-Dead North Texas Woman Removed From Life Support"}, "story_id": 265750982, "twitter": {"site": "@keranews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@aasen"}, "author": "Eric Aasen, Lauren Silverman", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Judge Orders Pregnant, Brain-Dead North Texas Woman Removed From Life Support"}, "nid": 44337, "datePublished": "2014-01-24", "keywords": "Marlise Munoz, brain dead pregnant woman, pregnant woman on life support, Erick Munoz, John Peter Smith Hospital", "wordCount": 1316, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd34e5\"", "article_summary": "A state district judge has ruled that Marlise Mu\u00f1oz, the brain-dead North Texas woman who\u2019s 22 weeks pregnant, must be removed from life support by 5 p.m. Monday.\nHe has said he and his wife are paramedics who agreed they would not want life support in this situation.\nMu\u00f1oz\u2019s attorneys said the hospital continues to misapply the part of the state law that says a pregnant woman on life support must stay on life support.\nMarlise Mu\u00f1oz's husband, Erick, sued the hospital last week to have her removed from life support.\n\u201cIt is more of an ethical issue than a legal issue I think.\u201dMayo says it is not illegal for a doctor to withdraw life support on a pregnant patient in Texas."}
