The house fire also claimed the life of 47-year-old homeowner David Smith. It's a fire that has brought grief to the community, but on Sunday it also brought them together.\n\n\"When that pager went off Sunday night Steve didn't waver he simply replied send me,\" Ackerman family friend Mike Harstad said during the funeral service.\n\nMore than 1,000 firefighters and emergency responders joined Ackerman\u2019s family and members of the community to mourn the loss of the volunteer firefighter who went into a burning Brandon house to rescue the homeowner but never came out.\n\n\"Today's outpouring of grief and admiration is fitting to a man who dedicated his life to his family, to protecting and serving a community, a true local hero in every sense of the word,\" Harstad said.\n\nThe service offered comfort to the family and friends Ackerman leaves behind.\n\n\"Brother Steve is in a better place; this glorious place where there's no more pain, no more sorrow,\" Reverend Clyde Teel of Community Reformed Church said.\n\nWhile Ackerman's faith can offer hope, those who knew him best say his life can serve as a model for others.\n\n\"Let us hold Steve up as an example for how we should live our own lives with valor, courage, but also with compassion, sacrifice, and love,\" Harstad said.\n\nAnd as a bell tolled one last time to represent the firefighter's final call on Sunday Ackerman's fellow emergency responders let their fallen hero know they will now serve in his honor.\n\n\"Rest easy brother we'll take it from here,\" Harstad said.\n\nAckerman leaves behind a fianc\u00e9e and her children.
