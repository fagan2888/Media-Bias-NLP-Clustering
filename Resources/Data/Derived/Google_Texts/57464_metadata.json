Summer is finally over, at least up north, with the official, down-to-the-minute end coming at precisely 4:44 p.m. Eastern Time on Sunday September 22.\n\nOn this day, both day and night are approximately the same length, though now the days are shortening rather than lengthening, and a hint of chill is in the air.

In fact in some places the colors have not waited for September 22.\n\n\u201cCold air and a dry August have prompted an early emergence of colors for parts of the area, including Pennsylvania, New York and New Jersey,\u201d Accuweather.com says. \u201cMeanwhile, surrounding regions may be hindered by flooding rain and unseasonable temperatures.\u201d\n\nWhat happens over the next couple of weeks could determine the depth and breadth of the foliage season.\n\n\"Most important is really what happens at the end of September and beginning of October into the middle of October,\u201d said Marc Abrams, professor of Forest Ecology and Physiology at Penn State University, to Accuweather.com. \"That's really the crucial period.\u201d\n\nStay tuned\u2014and start bundling up.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Goodbye, heat waves.
