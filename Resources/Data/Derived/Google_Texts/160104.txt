The House is preparing to debate several Medicare bills on the floor this week.

Two of the more controversial bills that could come up within the next few days include H.R. 160, which would repeal the medical device excise tax included in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (PPACA), and H.R. 1190, which would kill the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB), according to a schedule posted by the office of House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy.
