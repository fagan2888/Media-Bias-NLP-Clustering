The demolition of Stanford’s Meyer Library is bringing about a huge change in the campus landscape.

The university decided to tear Meyer Library down because it would have cost roughly $45 million to make repairs in order to meet new safety standards, according to the Stanford Report. The demolition spans over about 40 days and has been causing detours for pedestrians and bikers. Dust from the demolition is being controlled by spraying water and the excess concrete will be reused around campus. This recycling of material helped reduced the amount of trucks and traffic needed for the demolition.Meyer Library was first opened in 1966, at a location between Sweet Hall and Green Library. It was mostly used by the undergraduate community and was popular for its 24-hour study room. This very large structure used to be the home of the famous “Beat Cal” sign, which has since moved to the campus’ engineering quad.An open park is planned in place of the library.
