Eric Bloom and Sgt. Kelsey Letourneau were injured together on July 23, 2010 in Afghanistan.\n\n\u201cWe were doing a convoy just going up a hill and an IED exploded underneath our seat and that's where myself and Sgt. Bloom received our injuries,\u201d explained Sgt. Kelsey Letourneau.\n\nThey were both left with traumatic brain and back injuries. After recovering, they completed their year-long deployments in Afghanistan.\n\nOn Saturday, they stood side by side to receive their Purple Hearts. \u201cI was excited, very excited. And honored,\u201d said Letourneau.\n\nSgt. Bloom works as a career counselor for the Vermont National Guard. Letourneau is looking forward to returning to Cleveland where he works as a motorcycle mechanic.\n\nThe two brave men are part of the Vermont National Guard's Mountain Battalion, a battalion that celebrated 30 years of service on Saturday.\n\n\u201c30 years. It goes by in the blink of an eye,\u201d remembered Major General Will Roy, former Commander of Mountain Brigade.\n\nMajor General Will Roy was there in the beginning. \u201cWe were untrained, untested. It was a new concept and we didn't know where it was going to take us,\u201d said MG Roy.\n\nThere hadn't been a mountaineering unit in the Army since World War II.\n\n\u201cMountaineering is the ability to operate in very austere environments at high altitudes. When most people are just trying to survive, we're excelling,\u201d said MG Roy.\n\nThe mountain patch on their uniforms represents the Army's only recognized mountain brigade.\n\n\u201cWherever we go, there will be a mountain tab on our shoulder and those who wear it represent the best or our Army and our nation,\u201d said MG Roy.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sgt.
