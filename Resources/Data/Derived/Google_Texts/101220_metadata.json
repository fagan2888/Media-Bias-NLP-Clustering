But the tentative package being hammered out behind closed doors contains some key provisions that are likely to raise objections from both Republicans and Democrats.\n\nUnless Congress takes action by the end of this month, doctors who treat Medicare patients will see a 21 percent payment cut.\n\nFor doctors, the nail-biter has become a familiar but frustrating rite. Lawmakers invariably defer the cuts prescribed by the 1997 reimbursement formula, which everyone agrees is broken beyond repair. But the deferrals have always been temporary because Congress has not agreed to offsetting cuts to pay for a permanent fix. In 2010, Congress delayed scheduled cuts five times.\n\n[Also: Tracking 2015 mergers and acquisitions]\n\nThe current proposal for a permanent fix may not include full financing for repealing the payment formula, according to congressional aides and industry lobbyists who have been briefed on the talks but spoke on the condition of not being named because of the sensitivity of the discussions. That provision could run into concerns from many Republicans and some Democrats.\n\nIn addition, Senate Democrats are leery of another provision reportedly part of the negotiations \u2013 charging wealthier Medicare beneficiaries more for their coverage, according to top Senate aides who briefed reporters Sunday. They also noted that although Democrats are eager to attach to a deal an unrelated measure to extend the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, they would like it to cover four years, not the two years that the House is reportedly considering.\n\nStill, they said, with some changes in the package, Senate Democrats might be able to support the developing House package.\n\n\u201cOur members would like to get there,\u201d one of the aides said.\n\nFollow Healthcare Finance on Twitter and LinkedIn.\n\nHere are some answers to frequently asked questions about the congressional ritual known as the doc fix.\n\nQ: How did this become an issue?\n\nToday\u2019s problem is a result of efforts years ago to control federal spending \u2013 a 1997 deficit reduction law that called for setting Medicare physician payment rates through a formula based on economic growth, known as the \u201csustainable growth rate\u201d (SGR). For the first few years, Medicare expenditures did not exceed the target and doctors received modest pay increases. But in 2002, doctors were furious when they came in for a 4.8 percent pay cut. Every year since, Congress has staved off the scheduled cuts. But each deferral just increased the size of the fix needed the next time.\n\nThe Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC), which advises Congress, says the SGR is \u201cfundamentally flawed\u201d and has called for its repeal. The SGR provides \u201cno incentive for providers to restrain volume,\u201d the agency said.\n\nQ. Why don\u2019t lawmakers simply eliminate the formula?\n\nTwitter: @HFNewsTweet\n\nMoney is the biggest problem. An earlier bipartisan, bicameral SGR overhaul plan produced jointly by three key congressional committees would cost $175 billion over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office. While that\u2019s far less than previous estimates for an SGR repeal, it is difficult to find consensus on how to finance a fix.\n\nFor physicians, the prospect of facing big payment cuts is a source of mounting frustration. Some say the uncertainty has led them to quit the program, while others are threatening to do so. Still, defections have not been significant to date, according to MedPAC.\n\nIn a March 2014 report, the panel stated that beneficiaries\u2019 access to physician services is \u201cstable and similar to (or better than) access among privately insured individuals ages 50 to 64.\u201d Those findings could change, however, if the full force of SGR cuts were ever implemented.\n\nQ: What are the options that Congress is looking at?\n\nA: The bipartisan negotiations among key House leadership and staff from committees with jurisdiction over the SGR have been behind closed doors, and the offices of both House Speaker John Boehner, D-Ohio, and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., declined to comment on the negotiations. But some details are emerging.\n\nLate Friday, the bipartisan leadership of the House Ways and Means and Energy and Commerce committees \u2013 the two House panels with jurisdiction over the SGR \u2013 said in a statement that \u201cwe are now engaging in active discussions on a bipartisan basis \u2013 following up on the work done by leadership \u2013 to try to achieve an effective permanent resolution to the SGR problem, strengthen Medicare for our seniors, and extend the popular Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program.\u201d\n\nLast year\u2019s proposal from the House Energy and Commerce and Ways and Means committees and the Senate Finance Committee is reportedly the basis of the current SGR talks, according to the lobbyists and aides, in part because it enjoyed bipartisan support and would encourage better care coordination and chronic care management, ideas that experts have said are needed in the Medicare program.\n\nThat proposal would have scrapped the SGR and given doctors an 0.5 percent bump for each of the next five years as Medicare transitions to a payment system designed to reward physicians based on the quality of care provided, rather than the quantity of procedures performed, as the current payment formula does.\n\nTacking on a package of other health measures \u2013 known as extenders \u2013 that Congress renews each year during the SGR debate would push the cost even higher. They include additional funding for therapy services, ambulance services and rural hospitals, as well as continuing a program that allows low-income people to keep their Medicaid coverage as they transition into employment and earn more money.\n\nAs part of the proposal, the House members are also talking about adding two years of funding for the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, a federal-state program that provides insurance for low-income children whose families earned too much money to qualify for Medicaid, according to the lobbyists. While the health law continues CHIP authorization through 2019, funding for the program has not been extended beyond the end of September.\n\nThe length of the extension could cause strains with Senate Democrats. Last month, the Senate Democratic caucus signed on to legislation from Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, calling for a four-year extension of the current CHIP program, according to senior Senate Democratic aides. Democrats want that CHIP language in the SGR deal because \u201cthis may be the only health care vehicle moving,\u201d said one of the Senate aides.\n\nJust two years of additional CHIP funding is non-starter for Democrats. \u201cWe need to make sure that Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program is on a sustainable path,\u201d the aide said.\n\nQ: How would Congress pay for all of that?\n\nA: It might not. That would be a major departure from the GOP\u2019s mantra that all legislation must be financed. Tired of the yearly SGR battle, veteran members in both chambers may be willing to repeal the SGR on the basis that it\u2019s a budget gimmick \u2013 the cuts are never made \u2013 and therefore financing is unnecessary.\n\nBut that strategy could run into stiff opposition from Republican lawmakers and some Democrats. Most lawmakers are expected to feel the need to find financing for the Medicare extenders, the CHIP extension and any increase in physician payments over the current pay schedule. Those items would account for about $60 billion of financing in an approximately $200 billion package.\n\nConservative groups are urging Republicans to fully pay for any SGR repeal.\n\n\u201cAmericans didn\u2019t hand Republicans a historic House majority to engage in more deficit spending and budget gimmickry,\u201d Dan Holler, communications director for Heritage Action for America, said in a statement. \u201cAny deal that offsets a fraction of the cost, like the one currently being discussed behind closed doors and leaked to the press, is a non-starter for conservatives.\u201d\n\nBut physicians and other analysts make the point that Congress has already paid out billions on temporary patches that don\u2019t fix the problem.\n\n\u201cCongress has spent a staggering $170 billion on 17 patches in a 12-year period, the cost of which has far exceeded the cost of eliminating the SGR altogether,\u201d American Medical Association President Robert M. Wah wrote last month. \u201cThis continuous cycle of putting a Band-Aid on the real problem, creates an unpredictable environment that makes it difficult for physicians to budget and plan for practice innovations that could improve quality and reduce costs.\u201d\n\nQ. Will seniors and Medicare providers have to help pay for the plan?\n\nAccording to the lobbyists and aides, the potential financing options being looked at by House negotiators include charging wealthier Medicare beneficiaries \u2013 who already pay a higher premium \u2013 even more and introducing a surcharge on the popular \u201cfirst-dollar\u201d supplemental Medicare insurance known as \u201cMedigap.\u201d Experts contend that the \u201cfirst-dollar\u201d plans, which cover nearly all deductibles and co-payments, keep beneficiaries from being judicious when making medical decisions. The change could convince them to reduce opt against treatment they don\u2019t need, thus saving Medicare money. President Barack Obama\u2019s fiscal 2016 budget plan includes similar provisions.\n\nCongress could also extend the automatic 2 percent Medicare cuts in place as part of budget sequestration, but those cuts would face stiff opposition from Medicare providers and the groups they serve.\n\nSenate aides said Democrats there are likely to take issue with the provisions to reduce reimbursements to Medicare providers and to require seniors to pay more.\n\nMedicare beneficiaries already pay 25 percent of all Part B costs (physician services are included in Medicare Part B), so an increase in Medicare reimbursements to physicians would increase what seniors in the traditional Medicare program pay for premiums, deductibles and co-insurance, according to an analysis from the Kaiser Family Foundation. According to the report, half of all people on Medicare live on incomes of about $23,500 or less, and seniors spend three times more than younger households on health care as a share of their household budgets. (KHN is an editorially independent program of the foundation.)\n\nAsking seniors to pay more for their Medicare in exchange for higher Medicare payments to physicians \u201cdoesn\u2019t seem like a very fair thing to do for seniors,\u201d a senior Senate Democratic aide said. Using payment cuts to other Medicare providers, like hospitals, may be problematic as well because such steps \u201calways sort of generate opposition and heartburn for both sides of the aisle,\u201d the aide said.\n\nQ. How quickly could Congress act?\n\nLegislation to repeal the SGR could move in the House as early as the week of March 16, the lobbyists said.\n\nThe Senate Democratic aides said that they expected Democrats and Republicans in that chamber will want to offer amendments to the emerging House package, making it extremely difficult to pass any overhaul before the Senate\u2019s two-week break scheduled to begin starting March 30.\n\nIf the SGR issue can\u2019t be resolved by March 31, expect Congress to pass a temporary patch as negotiations continue.\n\nKaiser Health News is a national health policy news service.
