One day later, New York native Brian Pee created a Change.org Petition attempting to halt that long-awaited comeback. \u201cThere is far too much suffering in the world as it is,\u201d he wrote, in a desperate plea to the United Nations. \u201cThink of the children,\u201d begged one signee. \u201cI struggled for years with addiction to Phil Collins\u2019s music,\u201d wrote another. \u201cJust take a look at me now.\u201d Pee\u2019s well on his way to success: As of this writing, 1,387 \u201cSussudio\u201d-hating supporters have joined his cause. But his gain would be our loss.\n\nWhy such vitriol for Phil Collins, a man whose most heinous crime was cashing in on the mullet trend? Collins has suffered intense critical derision for decades \u2013 specifically since 1981\u2019s \u201cFace Value,\u201d his debut solo LP and first blush with pop stardom away from prog stalwarts Genesis. The bad \u201cAgainst All Odds\u201d jokes have continued steadily ever since \u2013 and they need to stop. Now\u2019s the perfect time to stop the cheap shots and examine the brilliance of pop-rock\u2019s most misunderstood genius.\n\nThe easiest starting point is behind the kit. Collins is among the most versatile rock drummers of all-time \u2013 but casual listeners have become numb to his skills or remained ignorant of them, mostly due to lack of familiarity with his pre-solo material. In Genesis, Collins helped define progressive drumming, evolving from the jackhammer force of \u201cSelling England By the Pound\u201d to the arena-tailored boom of \u201cDuke.\u201d In the early \u201980s, during the recording of Peter Gabriel\u2019s third solo LP, Collins, Gabriel and producer Hugh Padgham pioneered the gated reverb drum sound \u2013 a popular technique that helped define the punchy production style of the decade\u2019s new-wave and synth-pop.\n\nLike Beatles-era Ringo Starr before him, \u201cFill\u201d Collins was and is capable of writing drum/drum machine grooves that are hooks themselves, that can stand independently from their corresponding songs. We all know the dramatic \u201cduh-duh/duh-duh/duh-duh/duh-duh/DUH-DUH\u201d fill from \u201cIn the Air Tonight,\u201d but additional proof is scattered throughout his catalog: the dynamic surge of \u201cMama,\u201d the chugging bombast of \u201cMan of Our Times,\u201d the glossy pitter-patter of \u201cTake Me Home.\u201d Musicians from all genres recognized his signature talent: Over the years, Collins has raked in session credits for the likes of Paul McCartney, Tina Turner, Eric Clapton, John Cale, Robert Plant and Brian Eno. Almost everyone but jazz-heads forget Collins\u2019 work with underappreciated fusion group Brand X, for whom he contributed deep into the \u201970s. The man\u2019s influence seems boundless: Brann Dailor, drummer for prog-metal band Mastodon, is a devoted fan of Collins\u2019 drum style, citing him as a sonic benchmark during recording of the band\u2019s most recent LP.\n\nBut for many critics, drumming isn\u2019t enough \u2013 there\u2019s more to an enduring song, after all, than impressive chops. But in that department, Collins has always been stuck between a rock and a hard place, and he takes flak regardless of style: Genesis fans resent his transition from drummer to singer and his evolution into a pop star, while his solo supporters remain uninterested in his artsier beginnings. The tired faux-narrative is that by taming his edgier tendencies, Collins supposedly dumbed himself down for fat paychecks and stadium shows. But that\u2019s a gross oversimplification of a complex issue. The truth is that Collins\u2019 songwriting and sonic direction progressed organically across an entire decade with Genesis before he went solo \u2013 there would be no \u201cAgainst All Odds\u201d without \u201cFollow You Follow Me,\u201d no \u201cOne More Night\u201d without \u201cMan on the Corner.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Phil Collins is making a comeback, and the haters are already grumbling.
