I just felt I'd chosen the wrong vocation.\"I was reminded of this exchange upon receiving my med-school class's 40th-reunion report and reading some of the entries. In general, my classmates felt fulfilled by family, friends and the considerable achievements of their professional lives. But there was an undercurrent of deep disappointment, almost demoralization, with what medical practice had become.The complaint was not financial but vocational \u2014 an incessant interference with their work, a deep erosion of their autonomy and authority, a transformation from physician to \"provider.\"As one of them wrote, \"My colleagues who have already left practice all say they still love patient care, being a doctor. They just couldn't stand everything else.\" By which he meant \"a never-ending attack on the profession from government, insurance companies, and lawyers . . . progressively intrusive and usually unproductive rules and regulations,\" topped by an electronic health records (EHR) mandate that produces nothing more than \"billing and legal documents\" \u2014 and degraded medicine.I hear this everywhere. Virtually every doctor and doctors' group I speak to cites the same litany, with particular bitterness about the EHR mandate. As another classmate wrote, \"The introduction of the electronic medical record into our office has created so much more need for documentation that I can only see about three-quarters of the patients I could before, and has prompted me to seriously consider leaving for the first time.\"You may have zero sympathy for doctors, but think about the extraordinary loss to society \u2014 and maybe to you, one day \u2014 of driving away 40 years of irreplaceable clinical experience.And for what? The newly elected Barack Obama told the nation in 2009 that \"it just won't save billions of dollars\" \u2014 $77 billion a year, promised the administration \u2014 \"and thousands of jobs, it will save lives.\" He then threw a cool $27 billion at going paperless by 2015.It's 2015 and what have we achieved? The $27 billion is gone, of course. The $77 billion in savings became a joke. Indeed, reported the Health and Human Services inspector general in 2014, \"EHR technology can make it easier to commit fraud,\" as in Medicare fraud, the copy-and-paste function allowing the instant filling of vast data fields, facilitating billing inflation.That's just the beginning of the losses. Consider the myriad small practices that, facing ruinous transition costs in equipment, software, training and time, have closed shop, gone bankrupt or been swallowed by some larger entity.This hardly stays the long arm of the healthcare police, however. As of Jan. 1, 2015, if you haven't gone electronic, your Medicare payments will be cut, by 1 percent this year, rising to 3 percent (potentially 5 percent) in subsequent years.Then there is the toll on doctors' time and patient care. One study in the American Journal of Emergency Medicine found that emergency-room doctors spend 43 percent of their time entering electronic records information, 28 percent with patients. Another study found that family-practice physicians spend on average 48 minutes a day just entering clinical data.Forget the numbers. Think just of your own doctor's visits, of how much less listening, examining, even eye contact goes on, given the need for scrolling, clicking and box checking.The geniuses who rammed this through undoubtedly thought they were rationalizing healthcare. After all, banking went electronic. Why not medicine?Because banks deal with nothing but data. They don't listen to your heart or examine your groin. Clicking boxes on an endless electronic form turns the patient into a data machine and cancels out the subtlety of a doctor's unique feel and judgment.Why did all this happen? Because liberals in a hurry refuse to trust the self-interested wisdom of individual practictioners, who were already adopting EHR on their own, but gradually, organically, as the technology became ripe and the costs tolerable. Instead, Washington picked a date out of a hat and decreed: Digital by 20Move to Electronic Records Has Pushed Doctors Out15.The results are not pretty. EHR is healthcare's Solyndra. Many, no doubt, feasted nicely on the $27 billion, but the rest is waste: money squandered, patient care degraded, good physicians demoralized.Like my old classmates who signed up for patient care \u2014 which they still love \u2014 and now do data entry.(c) 2015 The Washington Post Writers Group", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Healthcare, EHR, Obama", "pubdate": "2015-05-29T11:21:44", "og": {"site_name": "Newsmax", "description": "Electronic health records mandate produces nothing more than \"billing and legal documents\" \u2014 and degraded medicine.", "title": "Move to Electronic Records Has Pushed Doctors Out", "url": "http://www.newsmax.com/CharlesKrauthammer/Healthcare-EHR-Obama/2015/05/29/id/647489/", "type": "article", "image": "http://www.newsmax.com/App_Themes/Newsmax/images/facebook/newsmaxFBLogo.gif", "page_id": 85452072376}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.newsmax.com/CharlesKrauthammer/Healthcare-EHR-Obama/2015/05/29/id/647489/", "title": "Move to Electronic Records Has Pushed Doctors Out", "description": "Electronic health records mandate produces nothing more than \"billing and legal documents\" \u2014 and degraded medicine.", "site": "Newsmax"}, "fb": {"admins": 100002083767056, "app_id": 323020797885219}, "msvalidate.01": "FAF1322EC761685A5DD9344A1C19E82A", "epoch": 1432898504, "google-site-verification": "Jt2HUKgzJJw9VwIQJv31ETytuvNNm5ypTWN6j0nYvHM", "keywords": "Healthcare, EHR, Obama", "article": {"section": "CharlesKrauthammer", "published_time": "2015-05-29T11:21:44"}, "original-source": "http://www.newsmax.com/CharlesKrauthammer/Healthcare-EHR-Obama/2015/05/29/id/647489/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "description": "Electronic health records mandate produces nothing more than  billing and legal documents  \u2014 and degraded medicine."}, "article_summary": "Instead, Washington picked a date out of a hat and decreed: Digital by 20Move to Electronic Records Has Pushed Doctors Out15.The results are not pretty.\nOne study in the American Journal of Emergency Medicine found that emergency-room doctors spend 43 percent of their time entering electronic records information, 28 percent with patients.\nprogressively intrusive and usually unproductive rules and regulations,\" topped by an electronic health records (EHR) mandate that produces nothing more than \"billing and legal documents\" \u2014 and degraded medicine.I hear this everywhere.\n\"As one of them wrote, \"My colleagues who have already left practice all say they still love patient care, being a doctor.\nVirtually every doctor and doctors' group I speak to cites the same litany, with particular bitterness about the EHR mandate."}
