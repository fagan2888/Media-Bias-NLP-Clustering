Well, sort of.\n\nCutthroats head coach Derek Armstrong is stepping aside to focus on his team president and general manager duties. Assistant coach Brad Smyth will take over as head coach, the team announced Thursday.\n\nSmyth played for the Cutthroats in their inaugural 2012-13 season and joined Armstrong \u2014 his friend and former teammate \u2014 behind the bench last year when the team made a run to the CHL finals before losing to the Allen Americans in five games.\n\nArmstrong assumed the role of team president in January when Ben Rifkin resigned. At that time, Smyth took the role of director of hockey operations and he will remain in that post.\n\n\u201cThis is by no means my last time coaching, I just felt that it was important to continue to help with the growth of this great organization,\u201d Armstrong said in a statement released by the team. \u201cI have a great relationship with Brad and know that he will continue to move the team forward toward a championship. He has been a staple to the team and the organization as a whole.\u201d\n\nSmyth said in the same statement that he is excited to lead the team and continue the mission to bring a CHL championship to Denver.\n\nSmyth, 41, scored 28 goals and added 53 assists for the Cutthroats in 2012-13 in his last professional season as a player. He played in 88 games in the NHL with the Florida Panthers, Los Angeles Kings, New York Rangers, Nashville Predators and Ottawa Senators, tallying 15 goals and 13 assists.\n\nArmstrong and Smyth were teammates in the American Hockey League from 1997-2001.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Ben Rifkin,Brad Smyth,CHL,Denver Cutthroats,Derek Armstrong", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "All Things Avalanche", "description": "Denver Cutthroats head coach Derek Armstrong is stepping aside to focus on his team president and general manager duties and assistant coach Brad Smyth will take over as head coach the team announced Thursday.", "title": "Brad Smyth named Denver Cutthroats head coach", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/avs/2014/06/19/brad-smyth-cutthroats-head-coach/18597/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/avs/files/2014/06/Brad-Smyth.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Denver Cutthroats head coach Derek Armstrong is stepping aside to focus on his team president and general manager duties and assistant coach Brad Smyth will take over as head coach the team announced Thursday.", "creator": "@", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/avs/2014/06/19/brad-smyth-cutthroats-head-coach/18597/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/avs/files/2014/06/Brad-Smyth.jpg", "title": "Brad Smyth named Denver Cutthroats head coach", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Brad Smyth is the new head coach of the Denver Cutthroats, taking over for Derek Armstrong, who will focus on his role as president and general manager."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcabf1\"", "article_summary": "Assistant coach Brad Smyth will take over as head coach, the team announced Thursday.\nCutthroats head coach Derek Armstrong is stepping aside to focus on his team president and general manager duties.\nSmyth, 41, scored 28 goals and added 53 assists for the Cutthroats in 2012-13 in his last professional season as a player.\nTypically a run to the finals doesn\u2019t result in a coaching change, but the Denver Cutthroats will have a new face behind the bench next season.\nAt that time, Smyth took the role of director of hockey operations and he will remain in that post."}
