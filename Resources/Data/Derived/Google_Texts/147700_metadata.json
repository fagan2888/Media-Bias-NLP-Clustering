It seeks to put health insurance within reach of most every American, bring down medical costs and provide better care to more satisfied patients.\n\nThose reforms are playing out in rural clinics and high-tech hospitals in every corner of Washington. Here are some of the most pronounced changes in coverage and care since Obamacare became law five years ago.\n\nThe Medicaid surge: The number of people covered by Medicaid has spiked 44 percent since Washington officials made it easier to participate in the free health-care program beginning last year. Roughly 2 million of Washington\u2019s adults and children are covered by Medicaid, which is available to people earning up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level (nearly $16,000 for an individual).\n\nThe spike in Medicaid enrollment has helped lower the fraction of uninsured state residents to approximately 9 percent, according to data from last year. A 2014 Gallup poll ranked Washington fourth nationally for reducing the fraction of residents who are uninsured.\n\nBut the large number of Medicaid enrollees has meant fewer people bought insurance through Washington\u2019s exchange, creating serious budget challenges for the agency, whose funding comes in large part from taxes and fees applied to each plan it sells.\n\nAnd while it appears that Medicaid patients so far are getting timely access to doctor\u2019s appointments, despite their growing numbers, that could change.\n\nTo encourage physicians to treat more Medicaid patients, the ACA for two years boosted the government\u2019s reimbursement rate by 70 to 90 percent. That increase ended with the new year, though doctors and other providers may not have noticed as they continue to receive the higher rate on 2014 claims still being processed.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t heard a lot from the provider community, perhaps because they aren\u2019t seeing the difference yet,\u201d said MaryAnne Lindeblad, the state\u2019s Medicaid director. \u201cIt\u2019s hard at this point to assess the effect of the rollback.\u201d\n\nBetter, cheaper care: Imagine a health-care system that provides patients with Nordstrom-quality service and attention to their every need. Or an Amazon.com experience that welcomes patients by name, tracks their pertinent information in one convenient place and makes it easy for them to find what they need.\n\nThat\u2019s the system Dr. Joe Gifford is striving for in his role of chief executive of Providence-Swedish Health Alliance, an accountable care organization (ACO).\n\nACOs are an increasingly popular strategy for providing care designed to make patients healthier at a lower cost and with a better customer experience. It accomplishes this, at least in theory, by financially rewarding or penalizing doctors, clinics and hospitals based on measures of patient health and satisfaction.\n\nThe providers in ACOs achieve these goals by better coordinating their treatment of patients and with smarter follow-ups to manage chronic illnesses. Many of these changes are taking place behind the scenes and include technology upgrades for tracking patients and their health, but Gifford said some fixes should be readily apparent to patients.\n\n\u201cIf it isn\u2019t visible, we aren\u2019t doing our job,\u201d Gifford said.\n\nIn Western Washington, the Providence-Swedish ACO is covering 200,000 people enrolled in Medicare and Medicare Advantage, plus current and former Boeing employees. Providence has additional ACO and ACO-like arrangements elsewhere.\n\nThe Boeing deal was announced in June and while Gifford couldn\u2019t share the number of employees participating, he did say that \u201cthe enrollment exceeded all targets.\u201d\n\nThere are at least 16 ACO and ACO-like groups treating Medicare and privately insured patients in Washington. In the fall, the state plans to add an ACO-like plan to the insurance lineup available to roughly 190,000 public employees.\n\n\u201cWe need to start shifting how we pay, and pay for value [in health care],\u201d said Lou McDermott, division director of the Public Employees Benefits Board program. \u201cI\u2019m very optimistic that this is going to bear some fruit.\u201d\n\nNo denial of coverage: The ACA prohibits insurance companies from charging people higher prices or denying them coverage based on their health. A 2012 federal government study estimated that approximately one-third of American adults have a pre-existing condition, depending on which ailments are considered.\n\nThis ACA provision has led people with a history of health troubles to find affordable coverage. It also has allowed many workers to explore new careers instead of sticking with jobs they don\u2019t like because they couldn\u2019t risk losing the health benefits of those jobs.\n\n\u201cWhen the Affordable Care Act happened, I applied online and now I have awesome insurance,\u201d said Heather Verhey, a peach farmer from Royal City in Grant County.\n\nEight years ago, Verhey was diagnosed with and treated for breast cancer. She underwent chemotherapy and radiation, treatments that could cost $40,000 for a single chemo session. Verhey had insurance at the time, but her deductible was high and it was a struggle to pay her bills. The treatments worked and Verhey, now 47, hasn\u2019t had any recurrence of the disease.\n\nBut working on her family\u2019s farm in a job without benefits, Verhey couldn\u2019t afford the sky-high premiums she was quoted after cancer and before the ACA.\n\n\u201cI feel so fortunate, after all that time of so much stress with the [cancer] diagnosis itself and the money and the bills that you get. You feel like you\u2019re fighting for your life, and you get these crazy bills, and you have to take time off work because you get sick,\u201d said Verhey, whose current income qualifies her for Medicaid. \u201cPeople deserve to get treatment when they\u2019re sick.\u201d\n\nTrickier taxes, surprise penalties: For health-care reform to work, most people need to be covered \u2014 not just those who are likely to get sick. So the ACA includes a mandate requiring coverage, and it penalizes those who go without.\n\nThat requirement, as well as the creation of tax subsidies for those buying insurance through the state\u2019s exchange, has created additional paperwork and new complications for filing federal taxes.\n\nThe tax subsidies, which help lower monthly premiums, are based on how much a person predicts he or she will earn over a year. People who make more than they expected must pay back part of their subsidy, while those earning less get a larger refund when filing their 2014 returns. Kaiser Family Foundation estimated that half of the people getting subsidies would owe $794 on average, while slightly fewer than half would get refunds of about $773.\n\nEven with the changes, tax season generally went smoothly, said David Liesse, vice president of education with Washington State Tax Consultants, a professional trade group.\n\nSome of Liesse\u2019s clients, however, were caught off-guard by the penalty.\n\n\u201cThose who have had to pay, didn\u2019t really know what was coming,\u201d he said. \u201cThey knew about the requirement, which surprised me, but they didn\u2019t know the details of it. Some had heard about the $95, but weren\u2019t sure of it.\u201d\n\nFor 2014 taxes, most people who were uninsured owed a penalty of either $95 per adult or 1 percent of their adjusted household income. That amount goes up this year to $325 per adult and 2 percent of income for being uninsured.\n\n\u201cMost of them,\u201d Liesse said, \u201care looking to get insurance.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Much of the attention on the Affordable Care Act has focused on government-run insurance exchanges, but the law has had big impacts on other parts of health-care delivery.", "og": {"site_name": "The Seattle Times", "description": "Much of the attention on the Affordable Care Act has focused on government-run insurance exchanges, but the law has had big impacts on other parts of health-care delivery.", "title": "How the Affordable Care Act is measuring up", "url": "http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/how-the-affordable-care-act-is-measuring-up/", "image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://www.seattletimes.com/wp-content/themes/st_refresh/img/st-meta-facebook.png", "height": 200}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@seattletimes", "description": "Much of the attention on the Affordable Care Act has focused on government-run insurance exchanges, but the law has had big impacts on other parts of health-care delivery.", "card": "http://www.seattletimes.com/wp-content/themes/st_refresh/img/st-meta-twitter.png", "title": "How the Affordable Care Act is measuring up"}, "robots": "noarchive", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=329502124", "fb": {"admins": 2737159, "app_id": 1522735777957334, "pages": 38472826214}, "msvalidate.01": "29FBBD36D14799A9FDE7843BF1E1CDD7", "article": {"section": "Local News", "published_time": "2015-04-18 20:00:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-18 20:00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Local News, Health, Technology"}, "article_summary": "But while the government-run health-insurance exchanges have attracted significant attention, the goals of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) are much broader.\n\u201cWhen the Affordable Care Act happened, I applied online and now I have awesome insurance,\u201d said Heather Verhey, a peach farmer from Royal City in Grant County.\nMuch of the attention on the Affordable Care Act has focused on government-run insurance exchanges, but the law has had big impacts on other parts of health-care delivery.\nAnd while it appears that Medicaid patients so far are getting timely access to doctor\u2019s appointments, despite their growing numbers, that could change.\n\u201cWe need to start shifting how we pay, and pay for value [in health care],\u201d said Lou McDermott, division director of the Public Employees Benefits Board program."}
