The industry projections for the state are based on historical data and provide a guide for how the industry landscape may develop given current economic conditions. As the state continues to recover from the recession, North Carolina industry employment is projected to grow at a faster rate than the U.S. from 2012 to 2022.National projections are done by the Bureau of Labor Statistics every two years and form the basis for state-level projections over the same period. According to the summary from BLS, the national economy may add an estimated 15.6 million jobs, which corresponds to 10.8 percent growth. Over the same period, North Carolina has a projected 12.9 percent growth rate. The majority of the estimated growth in the state is in the Services sector, which mirrors the national trend.Projections at the state level incorporate a number of trends, including state- and national-level population, labor force participation rate, and industry composition data. Whenever possible, LEAD uses third-party forecasts of these factors in the projections. State population data, for example, is obtained from the North Carolina Office of State Budget and Management. The aging of the population, estimated by OSBM, will likely influence the growth in Health Services seen in the LEAD state projections.The chart below illustrates how fast the section of the population aged 55 and older in thestate is expected to grow until 2022. The 27.8 percent change from 2012 to 2022 represents 705,000 people. The Health Services industry is expected to grow accordingly to accommodate the needs of the 55+ population. According to the BLS, in addition to the aging population, \u201c\u2026by expanding insurance coverage to millions of Americans, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act will place even greater demands on the healthcare system.\u201dThe overall population increase for North Carolina may drive some growth in consumer-related industries as well, including Retail Trade and Accommodation and Food Services. The BLS notes that, \u201cMost of the 10.8 percent (national) employment growth is projected to be in service-providing industries.\u201d North Carolina is no different, with 92.2 percent of the 548,650 estimated new positions from 2012 to 2022 occurring in Service Providing industries.As mentioned previously, the majority of growth in North Carolina is expected to occur in the Services Industry. Services made up nearly 80 percent of the workforce in 2012, and will likely comprise a similar amount in 2022. Goods Producing industries, while expected to grow 0.3 percent a year on average, is estimated to account for 13.6 percent of total employment growth from 2012 to 2022. For comparison, Service Providing industries made up 67.1 percent of the North Carolina economy in 1990 and 73.4 percent of the economy in 2000.Of the fastest-growing industries in the state, four of the top five are Service Providing. The fastest- growing industry is Construction. The growth in Construction is primarily due to a pent up demand from the recession and the continued recovery. It is important to note that despite the projected growth in Construction, employment is not expected to reach the levels from 2007, when it peaked in North Carolina. The previously mentioned increase in the 55+ population is contributing to the second-fastest growing industry, Health Services. The Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services sector of North Carolina has been a strong point in recent years, with companies such as ABB Inc., PPD Development, and Transportation Insight having a presence in the state. This sector also has the third-highest annual wage in the state, making it important to the state economy.The table above also highlights the declining industries in the state, primarily in Manufacturing. The Manufacturing sector may lose nearly 44,000 positions in the next 10 years as the state shifts toward Service Providing industries. A large part of the employment decline in Manufacturing is expected to occur in textiles and furniture, traditional North Carolina industries. The decline in Apparel Manufacturing in the state is lower than the national rate, but Textile Mills and Furniture Manufacturing are expected to decline faster than the national average. While the overall trend for manufacturing is negative, some industries such as Pharmaceuticals, Motor Vehicle Parts, Animal Processing, and Plastics may see growth in Manufacturing for the state over the next decade.2 Data provided by Mergent Intellect, http://www.mergentintellect.com/ This article was written by LEAD economist Derek Ramirez.", "article_metadata": {"RATING": "GENERAL", "COPYRIGHT": "Copyright (c) 2016 by LEAD - Labor Economic Analysis Division", "GENERATOR": "DotNetNuke", "AUTHOR": "LEAD - Labor Economic Analysis Division", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "LEAD - Labor Economic Analysis Division", "description": "The Labor & Economic Analysis Division has published the North Carolina statewide industry projections on its website.
