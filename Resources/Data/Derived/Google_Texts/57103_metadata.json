The Cougars are also well positioned to earn a bid to a New Year\u2019s Six bowl game, likely the Fiesta Bowl, if they win the league championship.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited for the city, and I\u2019m excited for our university that we earned the right to host this game,\u201d said Herman, the first-year coach who has quickly turned the Cougars into championship contenders. \u201cWe\u2019ll certainly celebrate the victory tonight, but our goal was not to go 12-0; it was not to win the West. It was to win the conference, and that\u2019s something that has not been done around here in a long time.\u201d\n\nAfter struggling to its lowest point total of the year last week in a 20-17 loss at UConn, during which Ward hardly played because of an ankle injury, the Cougars were firing on all cylinders.\n\nHerman said it was nice to have an offense back.\n\nWard, who was injured two weeks ago against Memphis, was 26-for-35 and ran for 83 yards and another touchdown as Houston opened up a 38-17 lead by the end of the third quarter.\n\n\u201cIt really means a lot for the seniors for them to have another home game, but the preparations doesn\u2019t stop because we have another game next week we have to get ready for,\u201d Ward said.\n\nKeenan Reynolds rushed for 84 yards on 19 carries and a fourth quarter touchdown and was 13-for-16 for 312 passing yards and a touchdown for Navy (9-2, 7-1 The American).\n\nThe Heisman Trophy contender scored his 83rd career touchdown to match the Bowl Subdivision record set by Wisconsin\u2019s Montee Ball. Reynolds also set a Navy record with his 29th career touchdown pass.\n\n\u201cWhatever works to get us down the field we\u2019re going to do,\u201d Reynolds said. \u201cFootball is both. We\u2019re able to run the ball for 300-plus yards, so the game plan was for us to throw it, and we were able to complete some big plays in the passing game.\u201d\n\nNavy had its five-game winning streak snapped.\n\n\u201cOur kids battled hard and did some things, but they made a ton of plays,\u201d Navy coach Ken Niumatalolo said. \u201cWe had a hard time. The difference in the game was that we couldn\u2019t get them off the field. [We went] 16-for-19 on third downs, and they converted all of their fourth downs. We played decent on first and second down, but we could not get them off the field on third downs. It just killed us.\u201d\n\nHouston\u2019s Brandon Wilson, who was moved from cornerback to running back this week because of injuries, ran for 111 yards and two touchdowns on 22 carries.\n\nDemarcus Ayers had eight catches for 161 yards and a touchdown and threw a 29-yard touchdown pass in the fourth quarter for Houston, which compiled 555 yards of offense.\n\n\u201cIt was amazing,\u201d Ayers said of the postgame celebration, which included the fans rushing the field. \u201cLast week was the first time ever getting the field rushed on me. To come back this week and bounce back the way we did, showed we can overcome adversity.\u201d\n\nNavy\u2019s Jamir Tillman caught five passes for 162 yards and a touchdown. Chris Swain ran for two touchdowns for Navy.\n\nNavy had rushed for 400 yards in back-to-back contests, but its triple-option offense was limited to 147 yards by Houston\u2019s defense. The Midshipmen tried to make up for the lack of ground production through the air.\n\nAfter Reynolds was intercepted on the second play of the second half, Ward threw a 4-yard touchdown pass to Linell Bonner to increase Houston\u2019s lead to 17 with 11:27 left in the third quarter.\n\nFollowing Austin Grebe\u2019s 39-yard field goal for Navy, Ayers extended Houston\u2019s lead to 38-17 with a one-handed catch and run for a 62-yard touchdown reception from Ward with 2:26 left in the third.\n\nWard put Houston ahead for good, spinning away from four Navy defenders and scampering for a five-yard touchdown with five minutes left in the first half. Ty Cummings hit a 45-yard field goal to end the half to give the Cougars a 24-14 lead.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Greg Ward Jr. threw for 308 yards and three touchdowns as Houston defeated Navy, 52-31, on Friday afternoon, ending the Midshipmen's hopes of appearing in a New Year's Six bowl game.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Greg Ward Jr. threw for 308 yards and three touchdowns as Houston defeated Navy, 52-31, on Friday afternoon, ending the Midshipmen\u2019s hopes of appearing in a New Year\u2019s Six bowl game.", "title": "No. 16 Navy has New Year\u2019s bowl hopes dashed in loss to No. 21 Houston", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/nov/28/navy-has-new-years-bowl-hopes-dashed-houston/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/11/28/AP_202134576227.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/11/28/AP_202134576227.jpg", "description": "Greg Ward Jr. threw for 308 yards and three touchdowns as Houston defeated Navy, 52-31, on Friday afternoon, ending the Midshipmen's hopes of appearing in a New Year's Six bowl game.", "card": "summary", "title": "No. 16 Navy has New Year\u2019s bowl hopes dashed in loss to No. 21 H"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Houston, Greg Ward   Jr"}, "article_summary": "HOUSTON \u2014 Houston rebounded from its first defeat of the season with its biggest victory yet under coach Tom Herman.\n16 Navy on Friday, sending Houston to The American\u2019s first championship game.\nWard put Houston ahead for good, spinning away from four Navy defenders and scampering for a five-yard touchdown with five minutes left in the first half.\nGreg Ward, Jr. threw for 308 yards and three touchdowns to lead the 21st-ranked Cougars to a 52-31 win over No.\nNavy had rushed for 400 yards in back-to-back contests, but its triple-option offense was limited to 147 yards by Houston\u2019s defense."}
