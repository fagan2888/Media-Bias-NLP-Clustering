Canadian government threatens bird watchers for writing concerned letter about bee die-off



Dave writes, "A birdwatching group sent a letter to two federal cabinet ministers citing concerns over the effects of certain chemicals on the life of bees. Shortly thereafter, they received a threatening letter from Revenue Canada telling them to stop with the political actions."

It's part of a wider campaign of threats and harassment aimed at "advocacy chill" in the nonprofit sector.

A special squad of 15 auditors has so far targeted some 52 charities, many of them critical of Conservative government policies. Environment groups were hard hit in the first round in 2012-13, but the net has since widened to snare social justice and poverty groups, among others. So far, no group has been deregistered, but the audits have been expensive and disruptive for charities, many of which operate on a shoestring.
