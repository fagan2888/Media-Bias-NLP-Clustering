This one, too, is helmed by artistic director Steve Wilson. It will unfurl its colorful display at the Denver Performing Arts Complex\u2019s Space Theatre with the blessing of the Denver Center. Actor Leonard Barrett will reprise his role as Narrator.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fun to revisit a show that marked a change and marks a change again,\u201d said Bryce Alexander, Phamaly\u2019s associate artistic director and production manager.\n\nIndeed, quite a few things have changed. And a slew of recent successes speak to the professional maturing of one of the city\u2019s \u2014 arguably nation\u2019s \u2014 most unique artistic enterprises.\n\nIn spring the company received its second grant from the National Endowment for the Arts: $60,000 for \u201cJoseph.\u201d In 2013, a $10,000 grant allowed the company to bring its first guest artist in: San Francisco-based violinist Sophia Hummel.\n\nThe company\u2019s touring initiatives, which have taken performers throughout Colorado, makes an international leap. In June, the company announced it will travel to Osaka, Japan, in 2015 to conduct workshops and perform \u201cThe Fantasticks.\u201d\n\nWhen Phamaly first performed \u201cJoseph,\u201d the acronym PHAMALy stood for Physically Handicapped Amateur Musical Actors League. The next year it would become \u201cThe Physically Handicapped Actors and Musical Artists League.\u201d\n\nIn 2012 the outfit became simply, elegantly, strategically the Phamaly Theatre Company.\n\n\u201cThis direction is very planned. We said our mission is to inspire people to re-envision disability through professional theater,\u201d Alexander said, sitting outside the theater during the show\u2019s first dress rehearsal.\n\n\u201cBefore it was about providing opportunities, which is still part of our core values. But our mission really is to produce professional theater that has an impact.\u201d\n\nLast summer\u2019s Henry Award nominated musical, \u201cFiddler on the Roof,\u201d directed by Wilson, hit many a grace note. February\u2019s too-brief mounting of Tennessee Williams\u2019 \u201cThe Glass Menagerie\u201d was ambitious, resonant and well performed. The company\u2019s first holiday offering \u2014 \u201cIt\u2019s a Wonderful Life\u201d \u2014 had charms particular to the tale of dutiful son George Bailey as well as particular to the company\u2019s tweaks (Old Man Potter isn\u2019t in a wheel-chair).\n\nYes, recent successes have been impressive. Some things remain vitally the same.\n\nA few days before opening, the dress rehearsal of \u201cJoseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat\u201d looked a bit frayed.\n\n\u201cHow will they get there by Saturday?\u201d was this observer\u2019s thought bubble.\n\n\u201cThat was a rare insight into the madness that is Phamaly,\u201d Alexander said afterward with a smile. \u201cThe house foreman always says that he loves Phamaly because it\u2019s \u2018organized chaos.\u2019 \u201d\n\nYes, it had the look of mild disarray. Then director Wilson stood staring at the theater-in-the-round stage. In good dry humor, he began blah-blah-ing his way through his opening night welcome and patron pitch. He said a few more words. The lights went down, quiet descended.\n\nWhen the lights came up, the cast advanced in good voice, some in wheelchairs. Donna Debreceni\u2019s tight band started up. Organized chaos gave way to theater\u2019s magic, Phamaly-style.\n\n\u201cJOSEPH AND THE AMAZING TECHNICOLOR DREAMCOAT.\u201d Lyrics by Tim Rice. Music by Andrew Lloyd Webber. Directed by Steve Wilson. Featuring: Leonard Barrett Jr., Daniel Traylor, Don Mauck, Amber Marsh and Jeremy Palmer. July 12 \u2013 Aug. 10.
