(Photo: Alex Wong / Getty Images)\n\nThe Obama administration in its last few months is trying to push through some significant changes to eligibility for overtime pay. It\u2019s been touted as a plan to boost wages, but in reality will kill jobs and derail career ambitions for many.\n\nChanges to the Department of Labor overtime rule would dramatically \u2014 and immediately \u2014 expand eligibility for salaried employees.\n\nCurrently, salaried employees who earn $23,660 or less are eligible for overtime pay if they work more than 40 hours per week. The rule changes would more than double that salary threshold to $50,440.\n\nThis rule could have a chilling effect on employee job prospects because employers, particularly small-business owners, will be required to absorb the sizable new labor costs, or find other ways to reduce those costs.\n\nSecretary of Labor Thomas Perez said about 5 million new workers will automatically become eligible, and that it would boost employee wages across the country by $1.3 billion. The Economic Policy Institute is even more generous, estimating some 13.5 million workers will have a new or stronger right to overtime pay.\n\nBut unless the Obama administration is planning to help employers pay for the rule with an infusion of cash into the economy via tax cuts or other measures to stimulate growth, it\u2019s ridiculous to expect the higher pay demands will come without consequences.\n\nThe National Retail Federation estimates retailers would experience a $745 million impact and that 2 million employees would be affected.\n\nEmployers will be tempted to cut wages across the board to make up for the overtime costs, or cut the workforce and pay the remaining employees above the threshold.\n\nOther alternatives will be to hire more part-time employees \u2014 similar to what happened when Obamacare took effect and full-time employees became a new costly burden.\n\nAnd for anyone with career ambitions, the rule changes will be a hindrance. Those on track for management positions might see positions downgraded or removed altogether to cut costs.\n\nThe changes are also a blow to employers\u2019 ability to provide more flexible schedules for employees. That will disproportionately affect women, who are more likely than men to use workplace flex time if it\u2019s available, according to the Families and Work Institute.\n\nIt also flies directly in the face of Obama\u2019s stated concern for helping women succeed in the modern workplace.\n\nCongress has a few options. A bill has been introduced to nullify the DOL\u2019s proposed rule, but such legislation would surely face a presidential veto. And a Congressional Review Act, which gives Congress 60 days to pass a resolution of disapproval to overrule the regulation, is also a possibility. It, too, would be vetoed.\n\nAlternatively, Congress could rule to defund implementation of the rule changes.\n\nThe Obama administration\u2019s sound bites on boosting wages are not grounded in reality and insult the people whose livelihoods this rule change will affect.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://detne.ws/1TEKlRM", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Changes to the Department of Labor overtime rule could have a chilling effect on employee job prospects", "og": {"site_name": "Detroit News", "description": "Changes to the Department of Labor overtime rule could have a chilling effect on employee job prospects", "title": "Editorial: New overtime rule will kill jobs", "url": "http://www.detroitnews.com/story/opinion/editorials/2016/05/01/editorial-new-overtime-rule-will-kill-jobs/83798442/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/detroitnews.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Changes to the Department of Labor overtime rule could have a chilling effect on employee job prospects", "title": "Editorial: New overtime rule will kill jobs", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/211651cecb4b0b1927b8c4018c326907cb9a84a2/c=495-0-2505-2010&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/05/01/DetroitNews/B99387929Z.1_20160501165354_000_G4TTVDBP.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@detroitnews", "site": "@detroitnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=904391631", "fb": {"app_id": 175422022549521}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "Changes to the Department of Labor overtime rule would dramatically \u2014 and immediately \u2014 expand eligibility for salaried employees.\nAlternatively, Congress could rule to defund implementation of the rule changes.\nSecretary of Labor Thomas Perez said the new overtime rule would boost employee wages.\nCurrently, salaried employees who earn $23,660 or less are eligible for overtime pay if they work more than 40 hours per week.\nThe rule changes would more than double that salary threshold to $50,440."}
