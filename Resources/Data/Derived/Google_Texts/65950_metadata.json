With the help of his wife at the time and a local doctor, they opened up the small clinic in a house next to the church.\n\nThey saw about 400 people that year, Mr. Hillard remembers. They called it the Hope Center.\n\nLast year, more than 5,300 patients visited the center for help.\n\nThe center started with three volunteers. Now, more than 60 volunteers help each year with a variety of services.\n\nUninsured and underinsured clients use the center for everything from dental hygiene to audiology to physical and occupational therapy. People can also get free legal advice and Christian counseling.\n\nOn a Thursday in February, patients were greeted by Kathy Heffner and Sarah Derhammer, both retired, who called themselves \u201cFrick and Frack\u201d and their \u201ctrainee,\u201d 22-year-old Marisa Del Gaudio. She is going to physician assistant school at Marywood University in the fall and was there to gain volunteering experience.\n\nVolunteering, they said, is a way to give back and feel good themselves.\n\n\u201cIt makes our problems go away,\u201d Ms. Derhammer said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost like a party,\u201d Ms. Heffner said.\n\nThe trio helped check in James Levitski, who was at the center to see a chiropractor. At the center, a professional will help him with stretching his neck and shoulder for free. Elsewhere, he would have had to pay out of pocket, which would have been difficult.\n\n\u201cIf you have a problem, they\u2019re more than welcoming,\u201d he said.\n\nThe center sees patients without insurance and those who have insurance that doesn\u2019t cover certain conditions. Uninsured patients might be self-employed or unemployed, not able to get insurance through their employer or be between jobs. The underinsured might be military veterans who can\u2019t or won\u2019t go to a Veterans Administration hospital or people with Medicare, which doesn\u2019t cover all medical expenses or expenses for most dental care or eye exams.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to work through the holes in the government system so we don\u2019t leave anyone behind. We don\u2019t want to leave anyone behind,\u201d said Pat Colladay, a director at the clinic.\n\nThe center doesn\u2019t keep records of which patients have insurance, Mr. Hillard said. Anecdotally, they have seen some confusion with the Affordable Care Act from patients, Mr. Colladay said.\n\nAlthough the act expanded health insurance coverage to more Americans, it doesn\u2019t guarantee increased access to health care services, according to the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that 23 million people will still be uninsured by 2019. That population will be undocumented immigrants, people who are exempt from the coverage mandate and can\u2019t afford other health insurance options and people who make too much to qualify for Medicaid, ASTHO said.\n\n\u201cFree clinics will still play a major role in servicing these populations,\u201d said an ASTHO fact sheet on free clinics.\n\nIn March 2015, The Hope Center moved its operations to 205-207 Main St., Luzerne. The move from the Back Mountain brought it closer to the valley\u2019s population, and closer to people who could be patients. The facility is two miles from six high-rise home to the elderly, Mr. Hillard said.\n\nThe move also gave the facility more room. Their first building was about 1,200 square feet. The current facility is 9,000 square feet.\n\nThe supply of patients is unlimited. Their own resources have limits.\n\n\u201cWe see more people now, but we also do more,\u201d Mr. Hillard said.\n\nKeeping the clinic running costs about $10,000 each month, Mr. Hillard said. Those costs include upkeep, liability insurance, buying generic medicine, utilities, school taxes and supplies. The center does not receive any funding from the government, he said.\n\nAn all-volunteer group helps the directors run the clinic. They are looking for a podiatrist as well as dental assistants. They\u2019re always happy to hear from dentists, doctors and audiologists who want to volunteer.\n\nAll of those medical professionals give immediate help, but the goal is longer-term hope.\n\n\u201cWe want to give hope to people who are hurting,\u201d said Mr. Colladay, \u201cand help any way we can.\u201d\n\nContact the writer: bwellock@citizensvoice.com\n\nWhere: 205-207 Main St., Luzerne.\n\nContact: Call 844-239-3405 or email hopecenter\n\nwv@gmail.com.
