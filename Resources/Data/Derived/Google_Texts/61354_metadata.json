(COURTESY)\n\nAutoFair CEO named Dealer of the Year\n\n\n\nMANCHESTER \u2014 AutoFair president and CEO Andy Crews is bringing back top honors from the National Automobile Dealers Association Convention and Exposition.\n\n\n\nCrews is the winner of TIME National Dealer of the Year award.\n\n..\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge honor,\u201d Crews said Sunday in a call from the convention in San Francisco. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a lot of guys and women that have done just an amazing job and been very dedicated to our industry and their communities. For me, it was an honor just to be nominated. I never in a million years thought I\u2019d be selected.\u201d\n\n..\n\nThe New Hampshire Automobile Dealers Association nominated Crews, 44, to represent the Granite State at the 98th annual national dealers convention. He was one of 55 nominees for the award, which he received Friday.\n\n..\n\n\u201cIt literally took my breath away,\u201d Crews said. \u201cThis is a direct reflection on the team and employees of AutoFair.\u201d\n\n\n\nCrews grew up in Tucker, Ga., and served in the Marines before starting his career in the auto dealership industry. He joined AutoFair in 2006 and the organization has since expanded from three dealerships to seven, with about 600 employees.\n\n..\n\nCrews was also recognized for his community efforts, including the American Cancer Society\u2019s CEOs Against Cancer, Greater Manchester Chamber of Commerce, The Live Free or Die Alliance and Manchester\u2019s Make the Grade program.\n\n..\n\nHe has also worked with the Boys & Girls Clubs, animal shelters and food banks. Each November, AutoFair\u2019s dealerships in New Hampshire donate a portion of the proceeds from every vehicle sold to New Horizons shelter and food pantry.\n\n..\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of personal time that I\u2019m able to put into the community because of the hard work and dedication of my employees,\u201d Crews said. \u201cThe team I\u2019ve got at AutoFair is what allows me to do in the community. Without their hard work and dedication, there\u2019s no way I could be out working on the boards and being involved and being engaged in philanthropic and community service.\u201d\n\n..\n\nThe award is sponsored by Ally Financial, which provides $10,000 to go to the nonprofit of choice selected by the Dealer of the Year. Crews said he will pick a nonprofit when he gets home, which could take longer than expected.\n\n..\n\nCrews said he planned to spend a little time in San Francisco and the Napa Valley celebrating with his family after the convention wrapped up Sunday night. With New Hampshire in the path of a severe winter storm expected to arrive Monday night, Crews said his flight scheduled for Tuesday may have to be rescheduled.\n\n..\n\n\u201cThe celebration may be extended just a little bit,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nFor more information: https://www.ally.com/learn/allydealerheroes/#!/\n\n\n\ndalden@unionleader.com\n\n..", "article_metadata": {"description": "Andy Crews is the winner of TIME National Dealer of the Year award.", "title": "AutoFair CEO named Dealer of the Year | New Hampshire", "og": {"site_name": "UnionLeader.com", "description": "Andy Crews is the winner of TIME National Dealer of the Year award.", "title": "AutoFair CEO named Dealer of the Year | New Hampshire", "url": "http://www.unionleader.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20150126/NEWS02/150129370/-1/News", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.unionleader.com/storyimage/UL/20150126/NEWS02/150129370/AR/0/AR-150129370.jpg?q=70?ExactW=600&ExactH=314&imageversion=MainHighlight&q=80", "height": 314}, "type": "article"}, "section": "Business", "robots": "NOARCHIVE, NOODP, NOYDIR", "keywords": "General News, Manchester,", "fb": {"app_id": 665237656918292}, "date": "2015-01-26 00:00:00", "twitter": {"description": "Andy Crews is the winner of TIME National Dealer of the Year award.", "title": "AutoFair CEO named Dealer of the Year | New Hampshire", "url": "http://www.unionleader.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20150126/NEWS02/150129370/-1/News", "image": "/storyimage/UL/20150126/NEWS02/150129370/AR/0/AR-150129370.jpg?q=70", "site": "@UnionLeader", "card": "summary$t"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2af1\"", "article_summary": "(COURTESY)AutoFair CEO named Dealer of the YearMANCHESTER \u2014 AutoFair president and CEO Andy Crews is bringing back top honors from the National Automobile Dealers Association Convention and Exposition.\nFrom left, Tim Russi, president of Auto Finance for Ally; Mark Ellis of TIME; Melissa and Andy Crews of AutoFair Honda, 2015 TIME Dealer of the Year winner; Michael Carpenter, Ally CEO; Jeff Brown, president and CEO of Dealer Financial Services for Ally.\nCrews is the winner of TIME National Dealer of the Year award.\nHe joined AutoFair in 2006 and the organization has since expanded from three dealerships to seven, with about 600 employees.\nThe New Hampshire Automobile Dealers Association nominated Crews, 44, to represent the Granite State at the 98th annual national dealers convention."}
