Fans are excited to see the big acts so close to home.\n\n\"I'd say we were probably thinking in that eight to ten concert range for our projections before we opened, and we're easily going to surpass that. We're only six months into it and we've surpassed it already,\" SMG's Rick Huffman said.\n\nEleven events have already sold out since opening day, which is a big plus for such a new event center.\n\n\"The ticket sales have been just enormously strong, and so promoters see that and they like that. It's a hot market and they want to bring their shows where the hot ticket sales are,\" Huffman said.\n\nIt's not just ticket sales that trigger acts to look at Sioux Falls. The Denny Sanford PREMIER Center is still new, a fresh face on the concert scene.\n\n\"It's a big improvement from the Arena where we had very limited seating, so it's great that they're able to bring in these bigger-named acts,\" Keith Neuharth said.\n\nThe new shine won't last forever, and Huffman says they're not taking this early success for granted.\n\nThe number of events that have already played at the Denny Sanford PREMIER Center is impressive on its own, but the list isn't going to stop there.\n\n\"You just have to find the right mix, the right dates, the right price and hope for the best,\" Huffman said.\n\nHuffman says they'll be riding this momentum of great ticket sales as long as they can, and if the sales continue as they are, he says there could be a chance some promoters consider offering Sioux Falls multiple shows for a big-time artist.\n\nNews\n\nEvents Center {{Title}} Remove Change News General Courts Web Only Crime Outdoors Events Center Non-Homepage Boredom Busters Pipeline Positively KELOLAND Technology Hunger Affordable Care Act Shops Flooding Remembering 9/11 Drought JazzFest Spring Storm Honor Flight Spencer Anniversary\n\nDoApp Health News Business News Sports\n\nAgriculture Markets Livestock Crops Politics\n\nHealthBeat Cancer Children's Health Heart Health Wellness & Nutrition General Health Beat Women's Health RX Resources What's Going Around OTC Diabetes Recalls Dental Health Men's Health\n\nPolitics South Dakota Legislature Budget Congress Taxes General Local Campaign President US Senate New Laws US House Iowa Ballot Issues Local Races Minnesota Gubernatorial\n\nEducation Funding College Elementary High School Pre K School Supplies Middle School\n\nSports Professional College High School Sports Zone Headlines Summit League Tournament Olympics\n\nBusiness Industry Your Money Matters Development Gas & Energy Legislation Economy/Stocks Employment General Health Care Technology Education Funding Tourism Banking/Finance Housing Transportation Insurance Meetings & Events Retail & Restaurants All Industries On The Move Shops Agriculture\n\nFeatured Stories Eye on KELOLAND Inside KELOLAND\n\nWeather Snow Forecast Records Rain Flooding Drought WX Corner General\n\nWorld News\n\nInvestigates GEAR UP\n\nSponsored Done\n\n\u00a9 2016 KELOLAND TV.
