Alan Grayson, the famously strident liberal, is also one of the richest people in Congress. He\u2019s now quite a bit less rich because he got duped out of $18 million in an investment scheme:\n\nFor the second time in his life, Rep. Alan Grayson (D-FL) has lost millions to fraud. Grayson was recently named in federal court papers in the case against William Dean Chapman, a Virginia man who was sentenced Friday to 12 years in prison. Chapman pleaded guilty in May to a scheme that cheated Grayson and about 120 other people out of more than $35 million, The Associated Press reported on Monday.\n\nYikes, not cool, even for an adversary as nasty as Grayson. He\u2019s the one who doesn\u2019t think people should keep what they earn, not me. Grayson\u2019s name was supposed to be concealed in official documents, but references to his full name slipped through:\n\nNothing in the court papers suggests Grayson was anything but a victim of the scheme. Grayson, a former trial attorney, said he has had a long record for picking winning stocks, which formed the basis for his personal fortune. The scheme worked like this: clients would turn over their stocks to Chapman as collateral for a loan, and Chapman would let customers borrow about 90% of the stocks\u2019 value. If the stocks did badly, borrowers could walk away and keep the money they were loaned. If the borrowers\u2019 stocks did well, they would repay the loan with interest, and Chapman was supposed to return the stocks to the investor at their increased value. According to court papers, Chapman sold the stocks and had no way to fulfill his obligations if a client\u2019s stock portfolio did well. \u201cThat\u2019s why (Chapman) is going to prison for a long, long time,\u201d Grayson said. \u201cAt least in the end, some kind of justice was served.\u201d In Grayson\u2019s case, his stocks performed astronomically well while they were entrusted to Chapman and his company, Alexander Capital Markets.\n\nIt sounds like Grayson hadn\u2019t found out about the first scam before he invested in the second, so it\u2019s not as dumb as it sounds. But it does sound like he might be some sort of stock savant, capable of picking phenomenally but incapable of reading personalities and social cues that would give away a scam like this. Also, isn\u2019t it curious that even though Grayson is one of the richest people in Congress, that\u2019s never a giant part of his biography when he\u2019s profiled and referred to in media huh?\n\nAnd, while we\u2019re on a schadenfreudey kick, enjoy \u201cSNL\u201d knocking Al Sharpton this weekend. But these guys are the smart ones, right?\n\nKenan Thompson, SNL\u2019s Al Sharpton, spent the joke segment discussing the \u201cfixed\u201d Obamacare website in a discussion with \u201cunpaid Huffington Post correspondent\u201d Paul Douchet (whose name Sharpton could not pronounce), played by Paul Rudd. \u201cThe website now works 90 percent of the time, but Republicans still don\u2019t want to give credit where credit is kind of due,\u201d Sharpton said. The health-care website is \u201cnow capable of handling 800,000 folks a day. Wow. That\u2019s 200,000 short of a butt-load,\u201d he said. To back his claim, Thompson\u2019s Sharpton cites only Obama and the Obama administration: \u201cThis law is working. President Obama said it, the White House report said it, and the official white House spokesman said it. That\u2019s three different people. How much more evidence do we need?\u201d\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Oops.", "title": "Alan Grayson scammed out of millions\u2026for the second time", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2013/12/10/alan-grayson-scammed-out-of-millions-for-the-second-time/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-11T02:21:56+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-12-11T02:29:17+00:00"}, "keywords": "Al Sharpton, Alan Grayson, scam, snl,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8978\"", "article_summary": "According to court papers, Chapman sold the stocks and had no way to fulfill his obligations if a client\u2019s stock portfolio did well.\nAlan Grayson scammed out of millions\u2026for the second timeposted at 9:21 pm on December 10, 2013 by Mary Katharine HamWould it be too mean to say, maybe at a certain point, you\u2019ve made enough money?\nRep.
