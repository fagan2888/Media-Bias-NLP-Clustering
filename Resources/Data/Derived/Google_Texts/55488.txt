Nebraska Attorney General Jon Bruning announced his candidacy to become governor.

Bruning announced his decision on Twitter around midnight on Sunday and his website is already up and running.

On the website the campaign posted a YouTube clip of why Bruning wants to run saying he wants to uphold Nebraska's reputation.

"I want to be governor of this great state to continue the tradition that governors Heineman have started that's made this state so strong and then take it to the next level how can we make Nebraska even better.That's my goal," said Bruning.

Bruning also touts his credentials and how he's battled with President Barack Obama on repealing the Affordable Care Act.

Last month Bruning battled colon cancer, luckily he caught it early enough and avoided and chemotherapy.

Bruning now joins Republicans Pete Ricketts, state senators Tom Carlson and Beau McCoy, state auditor Mike Foley and attorney Bryan Slone.

The primary is on May 13th.
