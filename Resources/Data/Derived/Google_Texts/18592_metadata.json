In the morning, a new Monmouth/KBUR poll was released showing the former secretary of state with a 9-point lead in the very competitive state of Iowa, which holds its caucus on February 1.\n\nA few hours later, Emerson College released an Iowa poll and it also indicated Clinton enjoyed a 9-point lead. At the time, it meant Clinton had led in eight of the previous ten Iowa polls taken, which translates into positive news coverage, right?\n\nWrong.\n\nBecause around 5 p.m., CNN released its latest Iowa polling results, showing Senator Bernie Sanders with an 8-point advantage. So instead of basking in positive coverage about leading in two of the three latest Iowa polls, Clinton had to settle for \u201cit\u2019s a draw\u201d reports regarding Thursday\u2019s three Iowa polls, right?\n\nWrong, again.\n\nInstead of reporting on the three polls, several major news organizations yesterday ignored the first two polls and only reported on the CNN survey.\n\nAt The New York Times, the CNN poll was news: But the KBUR and Emerson polls were not covered.\n\nAt Time, the CNN poll was big news. (\u201cSanders surges.\u201d) But the KBUR and Emerson polls were not covered.\n\nAt Politico, the CNN poll was big news. But the KBUR and Emerson polls were not covered.\n\nMore? According to a TVEyes search, both CBS This Morning and NBC\u2019s Today reported on the CNN poll (\u201ca big change\u201d) this morning, and ignored the KBUR and Emerson polls.\n\nFor lots of news outlets, only the CNN Iowa poll was treated as newsworthy on Thursday. That\u2019s remarkable.\n\nI wonder if this is how the newsroom conservations unfolded:\n\nReporter: Three news Iowa polls!\n\nEditor: Who\u2019s winning?\n\nReporter: Clinton leads in two, Sanders in one.\n\nEditor: Just write up the Sanders poll.\n\nReporter: And ignore the good-news-for-Clinton polls?\n\nEditor: Yeah.\n\nI understand that journalists sometimes like to cherrypick the polling results that cover a span of days or weeks and select the data that fits the tale scribes are trying to tell. It\u2019s a dishonest tactic, but a common one inside newsrooms. But this goes so far beyond cherrypicking. This is just flat-out ignoring polling results from two surveys that are published on the same day that journalists swarm around a third poll with different results.\n\nThe practice highlights the disturbing trend of campaign reporters and pundits wanting to tell a particular tale and then fitting (jamming?) information into that construct. In the past, the campaign press was generally tasked with reporting and reflecting what was happening on the trail, not with whipping contests into preferred narratives. (FYI, The press has been hyping Clinton\u2019s \u2018doomed\u2019 polling numbers for months and months.)\n\nAnd for months, Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign has watched as very good polling results for her have been lightly brushed off by the press, especially national polls that often showed her with commanding leads in the Democratic primary, as well as her beating possible Republican challengers.\n\nThe heavy-handed attempt to mold storylines has led to some baffling journalism. Today, the Post simply announced as fact that Sanders is \u201cleading in polls by single digits in Iowa.\u201d While Sanders has had leads in a few polls, Clinton is still up in the state according to the RealClearPolitics polling average.\n\nEarlier this week, an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll showed Clinton with a 25-point national lead over Sanders. On television, NBC seemed to signal its own poll didn\u2019t matter much. Reporting from South Carolina for the NBC Nightly News on January 18, the day after the poll was released, Andrea Mitchell stressed that even though Clinton was \u201cstill far ahead in the national polls,\u201d unnamed Democrats \u201csay that if the dominos start falling in the first states the entire shape of this campaign could change very quickly.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The media has decided Bernie is surging toward an upset in Iowa, whether the data supports that conclusion or not", "author": "Eric Boehlert", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The media has decided Bernie is surging toward an upset in Iowa, whether the data supports that conclusion or not", "title": "Hillary just can\u2019t win: Even mixed poll results mean she\u2019s choking", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/01/23/hillary_just_cant_win_even_mixed_poll_results_means_shes_choking_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/12/hillary_clinton26.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The media has decided Bernie is surging toward an upset in Iowa, whether the data supports that conclusion or not", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/12/hillary_clinton26.jpg", "title": "Hillary just can\u2019t win: Even mixed poll results mean she\u2019s choking", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Hillary just can\u2019t win: Even mixed poll results mean she\u2019s choking", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton, Iowa, Media Matters", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "So instead of basking in positive coverage about leading in two of the three latest Iowa polls, Clinton had to settle for \u201cit\u2019s a draw\u201d reports regarding Thursday\u2019s three Iowa polls, right?\nFor lots of news outlets, only the CNN Iowa poll was treated as newsworthy on Thursday.\nBecause around 5 p.m., CNN released its latest Iowa polling results, showing Senator Bernie Sanders with an 8-point advantage.\nAt The New York Times, the CNN poll was news: But the KBUR and Emerson polls were not covered.\nA few hours later, Emerson College released an Iowa poll and it also indicated Clinton enjoyed a 9-point lead."}
