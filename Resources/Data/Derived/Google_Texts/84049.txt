The 2013 Presidents Cup teams visited the White House on Tuesday evening to be honored by President Barack Obama and, yep, it was incredible.

I mean, that first photo, you aren't getting a better golf-related shot than that all year.

I promise. You have Phil Mickelson with the "what investigation?!" crazy eyes, Graham DeLaet bro-ing, Jason Day possibly recovering from a pre-visit, uh, chill session, Nick Price looking wild, Webb Simpson being Webb Simpson, and Brandt Snedeker giving the "I'm not positive I voted for this fella" golf clap.

It has it all.

And of course Mickelson gave Obama a golf tip that he thinks will help him. That's about the most predictable thing that's happened this entire season.

The ladies were there, too, and posed with Abraham Lincoln.
