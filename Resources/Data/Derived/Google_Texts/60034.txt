OAK ISLAND, NC (WWAY) — Oak Island Mayor Betty Wallace is speaking out about a statement from the Gov. Pat McCrory on shark attacks.

The Gov. said state officials are looking into at what can be done after the 7th shark attack along our coast — two of which happened in Oak Island.

Mayor Wallace said she feels like the Gov. is passing off the responsibility on the beach towns.

“I was surprised and then I thought okay,” Mayor Wallace said. “He’s making it seem as if there is some action that some authority in the towns on the coast could have taken and I have no idea of any action in Brunswick County or the town of Oak Island that we could have taken.”

Wallace said she will be sending Gov. McCrory an e-mail inviting him to attend the Oak Island town council meeting on July 14.
