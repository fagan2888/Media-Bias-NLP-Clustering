The employer mandate will apply to about 4 percent of employers in the U.S., according to the Treasury Department.\n\n\u201cWe still get questions why all this information is required. It's not just for administration of 4980H, it is also for 36B, which is very important,\u201d Tackney said, referring to rules on the ACA premium tax credit (PTC). The same form will be used to help individuals understand their eligibility for the PTC when filing their Form 1040, U.S. Individual Income Tax Return.\n\n\u2018Tricky Parts' for Employers\n\nEmployers will encounter one particularly \u201ctricky part\u201d when filing their authoritative annual returns listing comprehensive data on offers of coverage to employees, Tackney said. Only one statement should be filed for each full-time employee. \u201cFor most people that won't be a problem because they'll have worked in one place the entire time,\u201d he said.\n\nThe process becomes more complicated for employees that may have been promoted and thus moved from an insured group of employees to a self-insured group of employees, Tackney said. Employers can file a report for each category of employee, but employers will need to figure out how to file a single form, and which reporting category to use, for employees who have been members of both categories, he said.\n\nA second filing for the same employee would override the first, resulting in incomplete data for that individual and potentially creating an opportunity for the employer to be assessed a penalty for appearing to not have offered affordable minimum value coverage throughout the year, he said.\n\n\u201cIf you give me one that says what their offer of coverage was January to June and you give me another one that says July to December, the second one that comes in is going to bump the first and we're going to assume you didn't offer them anything for the other six months, and you're not going to want that to happen,\u201d said Tackney.\n\nAdditional Complications\n\nEmployers will also need to track an employee's movements from one subsidiary company to another, in which case an employee would show up on the annual filings of both subsidiaries, he said.\n\nEven employees who were only full-time for a single month during a calendar year must be reported, he said. \u201cOnce they're in the gate for a full-time employee in any calendar month, they're in.\u201d Employers will be able to provide additional information explaining the situation for the other months, he said.\n\nEmployers will have some relief from potential foot faults under the final Section 4980H rules through the alternative reporting mechanisms, Tackney said. \u201cBasically if you give somebody a cheap enough offer based on the federal poverty line, then they are firewalled. There is no way they are not firewalled or that the rest of their family is not firewalled,\u201d he said.\n\nUnder one of the two alternative reporting mechanisms, employers can provide a reduced amount of information to the IRS and employees, so long as they can state that they offered affordable minimum value coverage.\n\n\u201cWe don't really care exactly what the price was because we know everybody's going to be firewalled, so you can provide us a little bit more limited information and you can also, instead of providing specific information to the employee, you can just tell the employee that because of their offer, they are firewalled,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI would stress that a lot of this is going to be in the forms and instructions,\u201d Tackney said, adding that the agency is concerned that employees in particular may be overwhelmed when they receive their reports on offers of coverage for the first year. \u201cThis is definitely going to be one of those where, to truly understand this, you're going to have to have the instructions along with the form,\u201d Tackney said.\n\nThe IRS welcomes comments on how to simplify reporting for all parties, Tackney said, and recommended that employers provide the instructions with the form when sending reports to employees.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Lydia Beyoud at lbeyoud@bna.com\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Brett Ferguson at bferguson@bna.com", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.bna.com/complex-aca-filing-n17179890455/", "image": "http://www.bna.com/uploadedImages/BNA_V2/Company/BnaSocialShare.jpg", "description": "May 12 - Much more complexity is coming for both employers and individual employees to understand forthcoming Affordable Care Act-related forms and filing procedures for reporting offers of...", "title": "Complex ACA Filing Requirements Ahead For Employers, Individuals, IRS Official Says"}, "csrf-token": "LR8ySFtySrs09EXwQ76v_0yQkVOY3lrgR3iHAff3YqAyn_NL0XDiAhFX_bC16xcZsoprMF_qGr6Qutnjq98jCCyg1CK53AprCRIQhtpjxXI1:WUy7QHzo0moOA5hFKiS2Q7hHy0D1_7hf-Ibo960vQNrB27aSotHu_ZtiKF-3DBf07N4UjGTMHXz5tn64Wb_qkxWenlbMBuKf17uJB8c0vWM1", "description": "May 12 - Much more complexity is coming for both employers and individual employees to understand forthcoming Affordable Care Act-related forms and filing procedures for reporting offers of", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fragment": "!"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd89b6\"", "article_summary": "\u2018Tricky Parts' for EmployersEmployers will encounter one particularly \u201ctricky part\u201d when filing their authoritative annual returns listing comprehensive data on offers of coverage to employees, Tackney said.\nThe process becomes more complicated for employees that may have been promoted and thus moved from an insured group of employees to a self-insured group of employees, Tackney said.\nThe IRS welcomes comments on how to simplify reporting for all parties, Tackney said, and recommended that employers provide the instructions with the form when sending reports to employees.\n9655) issued Feb. 10 provide an additional year of penalty relief, but not reporting relief, for midsized employers with 50 to 99 employees.\nEmployers will have some relief from potential foot faults under the final Section 4980H rules through the alternative reporting mechanisms, Tackney said."}
