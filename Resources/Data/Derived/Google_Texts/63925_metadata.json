Insurance is also billed for any laboratory, x-ray or special procedures.\n\n\u201cThe biggest change is that we are now charging medical office visits, charging to student\u2019s health insurance plan,\u201d said Mary Alice Serafini, executive director of the Pat Walker Health Center. \u201cThat is working us toward future staffing, future building and meeting the demand we have right now.\u201d\n\nThis does mean additional charges for students, Serafini said, but the new fees are targeted at obtaining from insurance companies money that was previously \u201cjust sitting there.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll these years we have been using the health fee to cover office visits,\u201d Serafini said.\n\n\u201cInsurance companies haven\u2019t had to pay us and so they got the break because they didn\u2019t have to reimburse. But that is what they are collecting now.\u201d\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, which took effect October 2013, everyone 18 and older must be insured. Those who do not have the required coverage will face a penalty in 2014, but many college age residents still lack coverage.\n\nAbout 27 percent of U.S. residents between the ages of 19 and 25 were uninsured in 2012, according the latest census data.\n\nUA students are no exception. Anywhere from 25 to 35 percent of students were without health insurance as of 2013, according to Pat Walker Center research.\n\nPat Walker also applied new fees to Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS). The student health fee covers an intake assessment at CAPS, Emergency Services, case management services, referral services, outreach and group counseling. A fee of $20 is charged for individual counseling. Students\u2019 must pay $20 for individual counseling visits. The initial visit to see a psychiatrist is $85 for the first appointment and $40 for each follow-up visit.\n\nBecause insurance reimbursement for psychiatric treatment is more difficult than reimbursement for other medical exams, Pat Walker set up CAPS to be all self-pay, Serafini said. Students who want to pursue mental health insurance coverage must personally send the needed paperwork to their insurance companies, she said.\n\nRaising prices on student health care was a difficult decision, but one Serafini said she thinks students understand.\n\n\u201cThis summer we had a team that called students who had used us six or more times in the last year and let them know about it,\u201d Serafini said. \u201cTheir reactions were mostly \u2018Well that sounds like what happens at my other health care provider, so I am OK with it.\u2019\u201d\n\nStudents have varying opinions on the new fees.\n\nSenior Ashton Pohlman has used the center both when sick and before studying abroad. She said she would now rather travel three and a half hours to see her family doctor.\n\n\u201cEven with the charges, it is still more convenient and faster for students,\u201d Pohlman said. \u201cThat being said, I trust my clinic at home more. So knowing I would have to pay either way, I\u2019d probably go home.\u201d\n\nThe fees could deter some students from seeking treatment when they first become ill.\n\n\u201cMost students will go no matter what if they are sick and live on or near campus, but it could cause some to hold off because of everything they are already having to pay for,\u201d junior Alberto Chavez said.\n\nThe number of uninsured UA students might seem high, but Serafini said the co-pay charges would lend clearer data for this year.\n\n\u201cHopefully that is not what is happening now, but it has only been since July that we have been charging for the office visits,\u201d she said. \u201cNow that we are, we expect to have a better handle on just how many people are paying with insurance and how many are not.\u201d\n\nInsurance enrollment through the Affordable Care Act is closed until Nov. 15, according to HealthCare.gov.\n\n\u201cUnless they have lost their insurance or their job, or had a major life-changing event, the open enrollment for health care is closed,\u201d said Amanda Rochier, a financial consultant at Pat Walker Health Center.\n\nThose who still are not insured can receive medical help at a discounted rate at Pat Walker. The service can be charged to students\u2019 ISIS accounts. However, Serafini said if students have insurance, they should use it.\n\n\u201cSome have insurance and don\u2019t use it,\u201d She said. \u201cPeople are funny that way. Health insurance is really financial security so health problems don\u2019t interrupt your education.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "The Arkansas Traveler", "description": "Pat Walker Health Center started charging new fees to UA students as of July.", "title": "Pat Walker Health Center Increases Fees, 25 Percent of Students Still Uninsured", "url": "http://www.uatrav.com/news/article_9e739d68-3df6-11e4-b328-0017a43b2370.html", "image": "http://uatrav.com/content/tncms/live/global/resources/images/_site/og_image.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ustrav", "card": "summary", "creator": "@"}, "description": "Pat Walker Health Center started charging new fees to UA students as of July.", "fb": {"app_id": 254125931379096}, "keywords": "news,campus", "news_keywords": "news,campus"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce18a\"", "article_summary": "Pat Walker Health Center started charging new fees to UA students as of July.\nAnywhere from 25 to 35 percent of students were without health insurance as of 2013, according to Pat Walker Center research.\n\u201cThe biggest change is that we are now charging medical office visits, charging to student\u2019s health insurance plan,\u201d said Mary Alice Serafini, executive director of the Pat Walker Health Center.\nHealth insurance is really financial security so health problems don\u2019t interrupt your education.\u201d\nThose who still are not insured can receive medical help at a discounted rate at Pat Walker."}
