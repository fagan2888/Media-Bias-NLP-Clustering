The Nuggets waived guard Nick Johnson, in addition to two other players Saturday, bringing the Nuggets’ roster to 15 players, the maximum allowed by the NBA. As a result, it means second-year point guard Erick Green’s bid to make the roster was a success.

All the while, the Nuggets’ final roster spot was down to which of the duo played better. Johnson had the added advantage of having a guaranteed contract, which almost always means that player will stay on the roster over one that doesn’t.

But Green, who has steadily improved since being drafted by the Nuggets in 2013, was good in summer workouts and was even better in the preseason. He’ll be the team’s third point guard.

Meanwhile, if Johnson isn’t claimed by another team, the Nuggets are on the hook for the guaranteed portion of his salary, which is $1.825 million. That means team president Josh Kroenke and general manager Tim Connelly valued the on-court performance over simply saving a buck. It also means the team kept no players acquired from Houston in the July trade for Ty Lawson.

The Nuggets also waived Devin Sweetney and Oleksiy Pecherov.

The team practiced Saturday, but rookie point guard Emmanuel Mudiay was not among them. He is resting a strained left hamstring.

“Emmanuel is still fighting his injury, trying to get right,” Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. “(Sunday), we’ll get him on the court pre-practice … get him loose, see how he looks. And then integrate him into practice and slowly build him up Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, where he’s hopefully getting through a full practice.”

Shooting guard Randy Foye (hamstring) returned to practice after missing two weeks. Also returning to practice was big man Joffrey Lauvergne (low back strain).

“But guys are headed in the right direction,” Malone said. “I have complete confidence in the training staff to get these guys back healthy. The good thing is we don’t play until Wednesday.”
