Can an adorable little kitten persuade you to buy health insurance?

President Obama hopes so.

On Thursday, the White House's official Twitter account shared several images from a newly created Tumblr called the Adorable Care Act--a cute play on the the Affordable Care Act-- featuring a spate of cuddly creatures thanking Obamacare for providing them with healthcare coverage. (Because Obamacare apparently extends coverage to kittens, ducklings and rabbits as well.)

"Kitten coverage till age 26: prayers answered. Thanks Adorable Care Act." Reads one gif with a ridiculously cute kitten. Another one, featuring a piglet, asks, "Wait being cute isn't a pre-existing condition anymore?"

If you give into the cuteness and fall for the clickbait, the Tumblr directs you to Healthcare.gov, a government sponsored site that explains how to enroll in the health exchanges under Obamacare that takes effect Oct 1.

The Tumblr, created by a former Obama campaign staffer, is just the latest effort by Obamacare advocates to convince young people to sign up for health insurance through the exchanges starting next week.

Apparently Obama's team of celebrity recruiters--like Oprah Winfrey, LeBron James and Jay-Z, among others--just isn't cutting it.

In fact, according to recent polls, the majority of Americans don't like Obamacare at all. The latest USA Today poll found that 53 percent of Americans said they disapprove of the law, while 42 percent said they approve.

To be sure, the poll was conducted prior to the adorable animals' endorsement of the law. So it's impact is still unclear.

Meanwhile, Obamacare opponents are clawing back with their own animal attack.
