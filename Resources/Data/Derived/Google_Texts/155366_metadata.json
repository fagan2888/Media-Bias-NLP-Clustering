Both villages lie close to Jebel Azzan. Rebels had hit one army tank with a U.S.-made TOW anti-tank missile.\n\nHe said Syrian troops were being supported by allied militia forces and Iranian fighters.\n\nThe involvement of Iranian soldiers could not immediately be confirmed, but two senior regional sources told Reuters this week that Iran has sent thousands of troops to Syria in recent days to bolster the offensive underway in Hama province and in preparation for another in the Aleppo area, which is in northern Syria.\n\nThe Observatory said the death toll from Thursday's fighting and air strikes north of Homs had risen to 60, including 30 women and children.\n\n(Reporting by Mariam Karouny and Dominic Evans; Editing by Mark Trevelyan)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "\"The military operation has started in rural southern Aleppo,\" a pro-government source", "title": "Syrian army, Russian jets attack rebels in southern Aleppo", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/10/16/Syrian-army-Russian-jets-attack-rebels-southern-Aleppo", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/mideast-crisis-syria-russia-strikes-test_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/10/16/Syrian-army-Russian-jets-attack-rebels-southern-Aleppo", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/mideast-crisis-syria-russia-strikes-test_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "\"The military operation has started in rural southern Aleppo,\" a pro-government source", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Rebels had hit one army tank with a U.S.-made TOW anti-tank missile.\nHe said Syrian troops were being supported by allied militia forces and Iranian fighters.\nThe area the army and Russian jets were targeting was close to a main road heading south towards the capital Damascus, Abdulrahman said.\nBeirut-based al-Mayadeen television said on Friday the army was fighting on three fronts south of Aleppo.\n\"The military operation has started in rural southern Aleppo,\" a pro-government source in Syria said."}
