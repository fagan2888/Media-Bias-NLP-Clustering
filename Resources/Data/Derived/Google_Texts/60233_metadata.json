Bush, Great Recession, Karl Rove, Paul Ryan, Washington Post, Politics News\n\nNobody in Washington talks much about the poor in America these days, even though they are more and more with us in the economic aftermath of the Great Recession. Perhaps that is why the Washington Post welcomed Paul Ryan\u2019s recent declaration that he wants to fight poverty \u201cwith kinder, gentler policies to encourage work and upward mobility.\u201d\n\nThe Wisconsin Republican confided to a Post reporter that he has been \u201cquietly visiting inner-city neighborhoods\u201d \u2014 too quietly to gain any favorable publicity, until now \u2014 and consulting with all the usual suspects in the capital\u2019s right-wing think tanks. He wants everyone to understand that he is seeking to figure out the problems faced by poor folks and how he can help.\n\nAs a 2016 presidential hopeful, Ryan evidently intends to rebrand himself as a \u201ccompassionate conservative\u201d \u2014 the same propaganda meme deployed by former President George W. Bush and Karl Rove during the prelude to the 2000 campaign for president \u2014 at a moment when the Republican Party badly needs appealing new images and ideas. The Bush gang dropped that gimmick well before they entered the White House, and it was never glimpsed again. But whenever a Republican spouts kinder, gentler, compassionate-conservative babble, the vaunted cynicism of the capital press corps gets washed away in a warm bath of credulity.\n\nBut just to be clear, there is nothing new in Ryan\u2019s perspective on poverty, which is impoverished indeed when set next to the outlook of his late mentor Jack Kemp, who became a conservative icon in Congress before he joined the cabinet as secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Although Kemp belatedly recognized the role of government in alleviating poverty, Ryan and the current crop of Republicans in Washington talk about volunteerism, charity and spirituality as the only legitimate ways to address social problems \u2014 while all government support for the poor must be slashed or eliminated, as prescribed by their budget.\n\nWhen Ryan suggests that volunteerism and charity will salve the injuries of the poor, he is merely reviving the \u201cthousand points of light\u201d hoax perpetrated by George H. W. Bush back in 1988, when as Ronald Reagan\u2019s vice president, he had to distinguish himself from the cold-hearted attitudes and actions of that administration to run for presidential office. It was nonsense then and it remains that way, because the volume of private charity in America is utterly dwarfed by the government programs that preserve the poor from starvation.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Don't be fooled by the congressman's latest efforts to rebrand himself.
