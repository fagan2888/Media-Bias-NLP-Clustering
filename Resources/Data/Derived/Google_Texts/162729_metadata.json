Its policies will not be found on the exchanges in Maryland, New York, Georgia, Ohio or its home state of Connecticut. The insurer recently bought Coventry Health Plans, which had also filed to be on several state exchanges, so Aetna is now reviewing both companies' remaining fillings.\n\n\"We believe it is critical that our plans not only be competitive, but also financially viable, in order to meet the long-term needs of the exchanges in which we choose to participate,\" the company said last month after withdrawing from the New York exchange. It will offer individual plans outside of Obamacare in the Empire State.\n\nUnitedHealthcare (UNH) is also planning limited participation in the new exchanges, at least for 2014. The company said it is taking its time to evaluate the exchanges, which it believes have the potential to be a growth market. It is only participating in about a dozen exchanges next year.\n\n\"[We] see 2014 as just the very start of the exchange markets,\" said spokesman Tyler Mason.\n\nFor Cigna (CI), the decision came down to its customer base. A giant player in the employer market, Cigna is relatively new to the individual insurance side of the business. So it decided to join the exchanges in only the five states where it writes 80% of its individual policies, said spokesman Joseph Mondy. But Cigna will continue to offer plans outside the exchange in all 10 states where it is involved in the individual market.\n\nThese cautious moves contrast sharply with a company such as WellPoint (WLP), a Blue Cross Blue Shield licensee that's embracing the exchanges. It plans to be involved in each of its 14 states as \"essential players,\" a spokeswoman said.\n\nThe absence of many larger insurers on the exchange isn't necessarily a bad thing for consumers, said Alan Weil, executive director of the National Academy for State Health Policy. The exchanges, which will include many smaller regional players and companies that have catered mainly to the Medicaid market, are expected to be very competitive in terms of premiums.\n\nSmaller insurers, however, may not have as extensive a list of doctors and hospitals in their networks, he said. But that's one of the tradeoffs for affordability.\n\n\"What brand of insurance is available on the exchange does not concern me a lot,\" Weil said.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "obamacare, aca, affordable care act, health insurance, economy, obama, health, health reform, health care", "title": "Big insurers ditching Obamacare exchanges", "og": {"url": "http://money.cnn.com/2013/09/10/news/economy/obamacare-insurers/index.html", "site_name": "CNNMoney", "type": "article", "description": "Several big insurers are opting not to participate in the Obamacare exchanges.", "title": "Big insurers ditching Obamacare exchanges"}, "section": "news", "author": "Tami Luhby", "vr": {"category": "economy", "type": "Article"}, "DC.date.issued": "2013-09-10T06:25:55", "keywords": "obamacare, aca, affordable care act, health insurance, economy, obama, health, health reform, health care", "fb": {"app_id": 521848191196480}, "subsection": "economy", "date": "2013-09-10 06:25:55", "twitter": {"url": "http://money.cnn.com/2013/09/10/news/economy/obamacare-insurers/index.html", "site": "@CNNMoney", "description": "Several big insurers are opting not to participate in the Obamacare exchanges.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Big insurers ditching Obamacare exchanges"}, "viewport": "width=1140", "description": "Several big insurers are opting not to participate in the Obamacare exchanges."}, "article_summary": "When Americans start shopping on the state-based exchanges next month, a couple of big insurers will likely be MIA.\nThe insurer recently bought Coventry Health Plans, which had also filed to be on several state exchanges, so Aetna is now reviewing both companies' remaining fillings.\nIt will offer individual plans outside of Obamacare in the Empire State.\nSmaller insurers, however, may not have as extensive a list of doctors and hospitals in their networks, he said.\nIts policies will not be found on the exchanges in Maryland, New York, Georgia, Ohio or its home state of Connecticut."}
