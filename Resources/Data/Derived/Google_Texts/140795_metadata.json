The author of books about country, blues, soul, and a definitive, two-volume biography of Elvis Presley, he\u2019s now turned to one of the great taproots of American music. \u201cSam Phillips: The Man Who Invented Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll\u201d describes the life and cultural context of the Sun Records founder. And it looks at Phillips\u2019s relationships with Howlin\u2019 Wolf, Ike Turner (whose \u201cRocket 88\u201d is sometimes called the first rock song), Jerry Lee Lewis, Johnny Cash and Elvis Presley, all of whom he recorded.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s worth pausing, for a moment, to consider how lucky it was that Presley walked into Phillips\u2019s studio and not someone else\u2019s,\u201d Dwight Garner wrote in a rave New York Times review of the Guralnick book. \u201cAnother producer (that term had not yet come into use in the record industry) might have put him to work singing country-pop ditties with string sections. He might have been another Eddy Arnold.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re also lucky that Guralnick \u2013 who wrote the script for a Phillips documentary made by A&E \u2013 tackled Phillips\u2019s complex life and times. We spoke to him from his home near Boston. The interview has been lightly edited for clarity.\n\nThe subtitle of your book is \u201cThe Man Who Invented Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll.\u201d I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the first person to call him that, and the phrase served as the title for a documentary years ago. Overall, give us a sense of how important Phillips was to the birth and early evolution of the music.\n\nWhat I think was remarkable about Sam, besides the fact that from a tiny little storefront studio in Memphis, so much music came out of such a tiny space, from something that was essentially a one-man operation. From Elvis to Carl Perkins to Johnny Cash to Jerry Lee Lewis, [he created] what was essentially the dominant strain of rock \u2018n\u2019 roll during the first few years of its existence.\n\nWhat I think is extraordinary about Sam is that he had a vision for rock \u2018n\u2019 roll long before the music existed, long before he was even able to give expression to it\u2026 Years before he even conceived of building a recording studio, he conceived a music that could bridge all gaps, that could deny category\u2026 An African-American-based music that could leap across the chasms of race and social origin and class. And when he opened his studio, the first hit he had come out was [Ike Turner\u2019s] \u201cRocket 88.\u201d It doesn\u2019t matter how you label it \u2013 the fact is, it was an extraordinary hit, it sold over 100,000 copies.\n\nIn his first public utterances, in the Memphis Commercial Appeal, he spoke of that same vision. Of \u201cRocket 88\u201d being the kind of music that could appeal to all kinds, that could reach a mainstream audience, that could bridge that gap. While the record may not have fully realized what we envisioned for it, that was clearly what he was looking to achieve from the moment he started recording anyone.\n\nHe had the same vision for Howlin\u2019 Wolf.\n\nWhat was the racial situation like in the South when he was growing up? How much black music was he exposed to?\n\nAnybody growing up in the South would be exposed to a lot of black music unless they were deaf to it, either for reasons of prejudice or because they couldn\u2019t hear. The South has always been different from the North because while the legal system was always tangled in segregation, everything about day-to-day life argued against the formal practice. Whereas in the North, where segregation was not institutionalized, there was far greater separation.\n\nSo for Sam, growing up initially on that 323-acre farm outside of Florence, Alabama \u2013 his father rented the farm, but didn\u2019t own it, and couldn\u2019t hold onto it after the depression hit \u2013 he had sharecroppers, both black and white, working in the fields. Sam worked with them. What he was drawn to most of all was the sounds that were all around him \u2013 it could be a whippoorwill, it could be a hoe striking rock, it could be the music that came primarily from the black sharecroppers.\n\nBut he was also acutely aware of the racial disparities which existed. And we\u2019re talking about a 6- or 7-year-old kid. When I spoke to his family\u2026 they weren\u2019t altogether thrilled by the manner in which he expressed himself. Or the views he expressed.\n\nHe was drawn to this music; he was drawn to all sorts of music. H loved John Philip Sousa. He loved hillbilly music. He loved gospel music.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Salon talks to Peter Guralnick about his new biography of Sam Phillips, the founder of Sun Studios", "title": "\u201cHe had a vision for rock \u2018n\u2019 roll long before the music existed\u201d: Peter Guralnick digs deep into the history of the man who made Elvis Presley", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Salon talks to Peter Guralnick about his new biography of Sam Phillips, the founder of Sun Studios", "title": "\u201cHe had a vision for rock \u2018n\u2019 roll long before the music existed\u201d: Peter Guralnick digs deep into the history of the man who made Elvis Presley", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/11/07/he_had_a_vision_for_rock_n_roll_long_before_the_music_existed_peter_guralnick_digs_deep_into_the_history_of_the_man_who_made_elvis_presley/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/11/cash_presley_lewis.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Salon talks to Peter Guralnick about his new biography of Sam Phillips, the founder of Sun Studios", "title": "\u201cHe had a vision for rock \u2018n\u2019 roll long before the music existed\u201d: Peter Guralnick digs deep into the history of the man who made Elvis Presley", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/11/cash_presley_lewis.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Scott Timberg", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Books, Elvis Presley, From the Wires, Jerry Lee Lewis, Johnny Cash, Memphis, Peter Guralnick, rock music, Sam Phillips, Sun Studios", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cSam Phillips: The Man Who Invented Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll\u201d describes the life and cultural context of the Sun Records founder.\nTopics: Books, Elvis Presley, From the Wires, Jerry Lee Lewis, Johnny Cash, Memphis, Peter Guralnick, rock music, Sam Phillips, Sun Studios, Entertainment NewsThe music writer Peter Guralnick has spent his long and celebrated career warming up for his new book.\nThe subtitle of your book is \u201cThe Man Who Invented Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll.\u201d I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the first person to call him that, and the phrase served as the title for a documentary years ago.\nThe author of books about country, blues, soul, and a definitive, two-volume biography of Elvis Presley, he\u2019s now turned to one of the great taproots of American music.\nFrom Elvis to Carl Perkins to Johnny Cash to Jerry Lee Lewis, [he created] what was essentially the dominant strain of rock \u2018n\u2019 roll during the first few years of its existence."}
