In 1974, Nixon put forward a plan to cover all Americans through private insurance, only to have the Watergate scandal force him out of office. An economic crisis prevented Jimmy Carter from pushing forward with a national health plan. Congress late in Reagan's second term attempted to expand Medicare, only to have the law repealed the following year. Bill Clinton had a 1,300-page health care reform bill that was never even taken up for a vote in Congress. Since Nixon's presidency, health care costs have continued to rise, often outpacing inflation. This increase is due to a number of factors, including the increased use of new medical technologies for diagnosis and treatment. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act signed by President Barack Obama was intended to cover the 30 million Americans who live without health insurance, according to the bill's authors. It has been the most far-reaching piece of health care legislation since Johnson's signed the legislation creating the Medicare and Medicaid health care programs. NEWS:Think You'll Live Long? Think Again\n\nAlthough health insurance was widely available to employed Americans in the mid-20th century, the unemployed and the elderly were often excluded from these plans. President John F. Kennedy campaigned on the issue of insuring these groups. President Lyndon B. Johnson succeeded where Kennedy left off, securing the passage of a bill through Congress creating Medicare and Medicaid. At the bill-signing ceremony, shown here, Johnson presented former president Truman with the nation's first Medicare card. Within the medical industry itself, an increasing number of doctors began specializing in certain fields of medicine rather than acting as general physicians. By 1960, more than two-thirds of doctors reported themselves as full-time specialists, rather than general practitioners.\n\nLike its predecessor, World War II would lead to new medical advancements, including the widespread adoption of antibiotics and the use of ultrasound. The war would also have a similar effect in terms of the spread of employer-sponsored health plans. Because the nation was in a state of emergency and had a legally mandated wage freeze as a result, employers had to attract workers to assist the war effort by providing them with benefits, including health insurance. Tax laws passed between 1943 and 1945 also gave breaks to employers who provided insurance to their employees, which gave businesses all the more incentive to offer coverage. Following the war, employer-sponsored health insurance became common. In 1951, around 77 million Americans had some kind of coverage, according to an insurance industry trade group. That era also saw one of the most celebrated medical achievements in history: Jonas Salk's polio vaccine. NEWS: World War II\n\nAs part of his push to create a social safety net for Americans during the Great Depression, President Franklin D. Roosevelt advocated the passage of national health insurance. Roosevelt pushed ahead with efforts to pass Social Security first, a bill which intentionally omitted any mention of medical care to ensure its passage. Harry Truman attempted to carry on Roosevelt's legacy in 1945 by calling on Congress to create such a program. His efforts failed, partly due to criticism by the American Medical Association (AMA), who called the plan \"socialized medicine.\" In this photo taken in 1937, First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt examines a chart of enrollment of health care insurance plans.\n\nIn 1928, Alexander Fleming made one of the most important discoveries in the history of medicine: penicillin, a life-saving drug used to treat countless millions. It would be decades, however, before penicillin would be mass-produced. Fleming's discovery was the signature achievement in an era that saw medical treatment become more effective, and, as a result, expensive. The Great Depression also fueled concerns about affordability of medical treatment as millions of Americans suddenly found themselves out of work. In 1929, Baylor Hospital provided the first group health insurance plan in the United States through an agreement with Dallas-area teachers. The plan was the forerunner of Blue Cross. The effort wasn't just meant to be in the best interests of patients, but also the hospitals. Patient facilities saw more empty beds as fewer patients during the Great Depression could afford treatment without participating in these collective prepaid health insurance plans.

The horrors of World War I led to advances in the areas of wound care, sanitation, pain management and more, according to an article published in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine. Hospitals in the United States began to widely adopt the practice of using antiseptics to sanitize their facilities, preventing the possibility of medical personnel or patients becoming exposed to infection. That decade also saw the introduction of the first employer group insurance contracts (though not specifically for health insurance) as well as the first physician service and industrial health plans.\n\nIn 1912, Theodore Roosevelt was the first presidential candidate to get behind the idea of a national health insurance plan. Roosevelt ultimately didn't win election that year. Proponents of government-provided health care tried to press the issue through state initiatives, only to see their efforts fail in 16 states. Roosevelt's plan may have certainly been ahead of its time, particularly since there weren't that many services that doctors could actually provide patients during that era.\n\nPrior to the 20th century, nothing even close to what could be called a health care system existed in the United States. Although the Civil War had led to some medical breakthroughs in terms of surgical techniques and pain management, medical knowledge, techniques and treatment availability at the time left little hope that patients would actually recover from severe ailments. As NPR's Alex Blumberg and Adam Davidson point out, medical treatments may have been downright medieval at the time, consisting of potions. But at least it was cheap. \"In 1900, the average American spent $5 a year on health care ($100 in today's money),\" they note in their report. How the Civil War Changed Modern Medicine\n\nToday the Supreme Court upheld the 2010 health care law in a dramatic victory for President Barack Obama. The lead up to today's decision has prompted debate between opponents and supporters of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act two years ago. Take a look at how we got to the health care system we have in place today. Do Mexicans Have Better Health Care Than You?\n\nLast week \u201cThe Toronto Star,\u201d one of Canada\u2019s most prestigious newspapers, published an article highlighting the dangers of the Gardasil anti-HPV vaccine. The article, by David Bruser and Jesse McLean, told the stories of a dozen Canadian girls whose health failed after receiving the vaccine and suggested that it was dangerous.\n\nThough the reporters acknowledged that \u201cHealth Canada and the U.S. FDA say the vaccine is safe. Hundreds of thousands of teenage girls in Canada have received the vaccine\u2019s three doses, the vast majority without incident,\u201d these caveats were largely overshadowed by dramatic and moving accounts of injured girls and ruined lives.\n\nA few years ago such a story might have been ignored, but amid the current climate of vaccination concerns it provoked a firestorm of criticism from doctors and public health officials who claimed it was misleading and would fuel anti-vaccination fears.\n\nThe Star dug itself deeper when its columnist Heather Mallick defended the original reporting while acknowledging that \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to teach myself about statistics and science.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m reading doctor and science writer Ben Goldacre\u2019s new book, \u2018I Think You\u2019ll Find It\u2019s a Bit More Complicated Than That,\u2019 about the widespread misunderstanding of research and results,\u201d Mallick said.\n\nGoldacre, a longtime, staunch proponent of vaccination, was alarmed that his name had been invoked in defense of anti-vaccination reporting and took to Twitter to admonish both Mallick and \u201cThe Star.\u201d\n\nAfter doubling down for nearly a week The Star acknowledged that they \u201cfailed\u201d in their reporting and did not give proper weight to science. According to a story by Global News Canada:\n\n\u201cThe Star\u2019s publisher John Cruickshank said the paper failed the public in the way it presented its story\u2026. Cruickshank took responsibility for the way the story was presented and said he understands why it could have given readers the false impression that Gardasil is dangerous.\u201d\n\nThat same day the newspaper published an op-ed endorsed by 63 doctors and public health specialists that stated in part:\n\nAlthough the article states in the fifth paragraph that \u201cthere is no conclusive evidence showing the vaccine caused a death or illness,\u201d its litany of horror stories and its innuendo give the incorrect impression that the vaccine caused the harm. Very unfortunately, this article may well lead readers to doubt both the scientific evidence and the recommendations of the Public Health Agency of Canada, the Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Canada, the National Advisory Committee on Immunization, and the Canadian Cancer Society about vaccination\u2026. The Star presented the stories of women who have suffered greatly. The article was engaging, dramatic and might have created fear. But study after study has shown that there is no causal link between the events the Star reported and the vaccine. About 169 million doses of the HPV vaccine have been administered worldwide. In any given large population, there will be illness and death.\n\nThis sort of story is not unusual. Last year dozens of Colombian teens complained about strange symptoms including headaches, convulsions and fainting in the days and weeks after many of them got a HPV vaccination.\n\nAs with the Canadian girls, though there was no clear link between the vaccination and the symptoms, the vaccine was suspected as the culprit. Part of the reason that people often blame vaccines is that they tend to assume that if one event follows another event, there must be some causal link between the two: The girls began having unexplained symptoms after they got the vaccine, and therefore the vaccine must have caused the symptoms.\n\nBut that\u2019s not necessarily true, and is actually a logical fallacy called \u201cpost hoc ergo propter hoc,\u201d meaning \u201cafter this, therefore because of it.\u201d While a few of the girls could have experienced side effects (which are clearly described on the vaccine labeling), there\u2019s no evidence that any of the serious health problems were caused by vaccines.\n\nThough The Toronto Star has acknowledged errors in the way the story was handled, the article remains online and has not been formally retracted.", "article_metadata": {"description": "One of Canada's most prestigious newspapers published a story warning of the dangers of HPV vaccines, and doctors weren't happy.
