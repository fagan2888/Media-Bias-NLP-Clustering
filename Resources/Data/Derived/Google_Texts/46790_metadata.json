Now, the eight-time Indian World Champion is ready to take her place on pro rodeo\u2019s biggest stage at the Wrangler National Finals Rodeo in Las Vegas.\n\nDennison has been the pride of the Dine Nation since she became the first Navajo to win a national championship in break-away roping at the National High School Finals Rodeo in 2010. The 22-year-old in her fourth professional season is now the first Navajo barrel racer to qualify for the NFR.\n\nLet\u2019s just start with what it means for you to qualify for the National Finals Rodeo...You're the first from the Navajo Nation to do so.\n\nIt\u2019s been a dream of mine since I was a little girl. It\u2019s pretty special, and I\u2019m excited to represent Indian Country and Native barrel racers. It means so much to me to let our people and people across the world know that you can do anything you\u2019re willing to work for.\n\nYour family is a big part of your success. Your dad Karl helps with the driving. Your mother Debbie is out on the road and older sister Devyn handles the public relations. How important is that to make this run with them at your side?\n\nGetting there wasn\u2019t all roses and [it] wasn\u2019t always what I expected. But it was a great process and great learning experience. It was awesome that my family was right there to see it first hand. That\u2019s what means the most because not everybody that\u2019s been a world champion or made the NFR has had that in their life.\n\nWhat is the plan of attack for the NFR?\n\nPeople have been asking if I\u2019m nervous, but I\u2019m not because we\u2019ve seen big crowds before. That\u2019s what makes it just another rodeo. We\u2019ve been competing against the same people for almost a year now. Some people get worked up over the hype, but it\u2019s just another rodeo.\n\nThe \u201cwe\u201d you are talking about is Eagle, of course, your nine-year-old gelding is a special horse. Tell me about him?\n\nHe\u2019s the only horse I\u2019ve been riding this year. We've worked with him since he was five to be more consistent and slow him up a little bit because all he wanted to do was run fast. When you have rodeoed has hard as I did this year, I had to make huge decisions to keep him healthy. I didn\u2019t want to run him if he was sore, which is why we came home three weeks before the end of the season to make sure I had enough horse when I got to the NFR.\n\nYou grew up in Tohatchi, New Mexico (population 800) on the eastern most border of the Navajo Nation, just north of Gallup. How do you walk in harmony in a world that\u2019s all about money and schedules?\n\nI was raised traditionally and traditional values are still instilled in me today. I think that\u2019s what separates me from other people. I believe in getting up early and praying for direction, thinking positive thought, and treating people with respect. Those things are more important today.\n\nYou have been a professional for four years now. Is it everything you hoped for?\n\nIt\u2019s a dream come true to make the NFR, but it was definitely a struggle. Being on the road isn\u2019t what it\u2019s made out to be. It\u2019s not all glamorous, let\u2019s just say that. Sometimes people you\u2019ve looked up to your whole life aren\u2019t the people you thought they were. You tend to see true colors in people. For me, growing up on the reservation and having all these other struggles, I had to work harder to be successful. What keeps me humble is that I don\u2019t want to change who I really am now that I have achieved some amount of success. Making the NFR has been a dream, but getting there really wasn\u2019t what I expected.\n\nYou are an N7 Ambassador and a role model in Indian Country. What are your future plans?\n\nI haven\u2019t decided yet, but I plan on going in a different direction and helping other (Native) girls be successful riders or horse trainers. I\u2019ll probably go to 20 rodeos in the next year and see where things are. The whole reason I wanted to make the NFR was to give people hope. Now that I\u2019ve done that I feel like I want to keep inspiring people and keep pushing them to try new things and get out of your comfort zone. I have schools lined up and some motivational speaking engagements lined up. I\u2019m so excited for that. It\u2019s a new adventure in my life that I\u2019m looking forward to.", "article_metadata": {"description": "New Mexico cowgirl Kassidy Dennison will be the first to tell you it\u2019s not worth having if it\u2019s not worth working hard for.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "rcjohnson", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/10/18/navajo-barrel-racer-ready-bright-lights-national-finals-rodeo-157415", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/dennison_kassidy.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Navajo Barrel Racer Ready for the Bright Lights of the National Finals Rodeo"}, "dcterms.date": "2014-10-18T18:21-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/10/18/navajo-barrel-racer-ready-bright-lights-national-finals-rodeo-157415", "dc": {"title": "Navajo Barrel Racer Ready for the Bright Lights of the National Finals Rodeo"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.title": "Navajo Barrel Racer Ready for the Bright Lights of the National Finals Rodeo"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb581\"", "article_summary": "How do you walk in harmony in a world that\u2019s all about money and schedules?\nThe 22-year-old in her fourth professional season is now the first Navajo barrel racer to qualify for the NFR.\nNow, the eight-time Indian World Champion is ready to take her place on pro rodeo\u2019s biggest stage at the Wrangler National Finals Rodeo in Las Vegas.\nDennison has been the pride of the Dine Nation since she became the first Navajo to win a national championship in break-away roping at the National High School Finals Rodeo in 2010.\nLet\u2019s just start with what it means for you to qualify for the National Finals Rodeo...You're the first from the Navajo Nation to do so."}
