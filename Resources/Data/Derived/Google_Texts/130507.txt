LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) — A Kentucky county clerk who’s been in jail since Thursday for refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples is asking an appeals court to reverse a judge’s ruling.

Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis objects to same-sex marriage for religious reasons and stopped issuing all marriage licenses in June after the U.S. Supreme Court legalized gay marriage nationwide.

A federal judge ordered Davis to issue the licenses.

She was found in contempt of court last week.
