Now he\u2019s stumping for candidates he used to attack\u2014just in time for 2016.\n\nTed Cruz blazed onto the national scene as the skunk at the GOP\u2019s picnic in 2013, launching a historic filibuster, pushing for a government shutdown, and raising millions of dollars for outside conservative groups that attacked his fellow Republican senators.\n\nBut with the 2016 presidential season on the horizon, the Texas firebrand has subtly changed his tune over the last six months. Instead of agitating against his fellow Republicans, as he did over Obamacare funding in the tumultuous leadup to the 2013 government shutdown, he is now reserving his fire exclusively for Democrats.\n\n\u201cTed Cruz, Team Player\u201d is a twist few saw coming from the freshman who has made too many enemies to count in Washington. But even Cruz\u2019s most vocal GOP detractors can\u2019t argue with the $250,000 pledge he made to the National Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee in September, making Cruz one of the largest individual donors to Republican senators and candidates this cycle.\n\nOn top of the NRSC pledge, Cruz has given thousands to five incumbent GOP senators, including $7,500 to Sen. John Cornyn, an establishment senator frequently derided by the Tea Party. And he\u2019s given significantly more cash to GOP hopefuls like Ben Sasse in Nebraska, Joni Ernst in Iowa, Steve Daines in Montana, Ed Gillespie in Virginia, and Cory Gardner in Colorado, according to filings with the Federal Election Commission.\n\nImportantly, none of the candidates that Cruz has supported in the last six months have been running against incumbent Republicans.\n\nCruz has also been on the road nearly constantly in 2014, focusing on the early presidential primary states of Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina, while making detours when he\u2019s asked to, like a surprising visit to stump for embattled Sen. Pat Roberts in Kansas. Roberts had been high on conservatives\u2019 hit lists in the primary season, but now Cruz has hopped on Roberts\u2019 campaign bus tour (only for a mile, but still) to help rally conservative Kansans behind the comparatively moderate 78-year-old.\n\n\u201cThe primary is over, and I want to speak to folks who are frustrated with Washington,\u201d Cruz told the crowd. \u201cI promise you there is nobody more frustrated with Washington, D.C. than I am. But let me urge you, if you\u2019re frustrated with Washington, the answer is not to stay home and keep Harry Reid as majority leader.\u201d\n\nRoberts, in turn, treated Cruz like the celebrity he has become among conservative activists, introducing him as \u201cthe prairie fire from Texas\u201d and, one time, as just \u201cThe Man.\u201d\n\nThe scene was all a long way from the days\u2014less than a year ago\u2014when Cruz was raising money for the Madison Project, which helped fund Milton Wolf, Roberts\u2019 primary challenger. Despite running a lackluster campaign, Wolf, a physician who posted patients\u2019 X-rays on Facebook and joked about them with commenters, came within seven points of beating Roberts.\n\nAnd it was light years away from the summer and fall of 2013, when Cruz and Sen. Mike Lee went on a fundraising blitz for the Senate Conservatives Fund, the group founded by Jim DeMint. The SCF used that Cruz-Lee money to run ads against seven GOP senators they were serving with, including Mitch McConnell, Jeff Flake, and Lindsey Graham. The ads attacked those veteran Republicans for not opposing Obamacare enough, even though they all voted against the bill and said they would vote to defund it. And by the time it was all over, his fellow Republicans in Washington were furious.\n\nBut now the Texan says he wants nothing more than to help the GOP win big this November. \u201cI am on the road almost every day traveling the country trying to turn out conservatives,\u201d Cruz told Breitbart.com last week on the way to a South Carolina tailgate. \u201cIf conservatives show up in November 2014, we\u2019ll win the Senate\u2014and we could win as many as 10 to 12 seats if conservatives show up and vote. That is my focus for the next 25 days.\u201d\n\nRepublicans who have been dealing with Cruz for the entirety of his nearly two years in the Senate, however, are skeptical of the Texan\u2019s newfound loyalty to the party. Some see it as an effort to win over at least a few friends before the 2016 presidential elections, when many assume Cruz will run. Others see it as an attempt to clean up the mess he made with the defund-Obamacare tactic that resulted in a government shutdown and allowed Democrats to cast Republicans as irresponsible and extreme.\n\n\u201cTed Cruz is throwing water on a brush fire he helped start, and I don\u2019t think that will be lost on Senate Republicans for quite a while,\u201d said a GOP campaign operative, who was not interested in having Cruz join his boss on campaign trail. \u201cHis \u2018defund Obamacare\u2019 stunt that didn\u2019t even stop Obamacare, divisive rhetoric on other issues including immigration, and fundraising for groups like Senate Conservatives Fund all served as drags on the ability of Republicans\u2019 otherwise strong chances in the midterms by wasting resources that could have been used on general elections across the country.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "1patriciamurphy"}, "keywords": "Ted Cruz, Republican Party, u.s. poli", "publicationDate": 201410160945, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "description": "The Texas firebrand made a name for himself by going after more moderate Republicans.
