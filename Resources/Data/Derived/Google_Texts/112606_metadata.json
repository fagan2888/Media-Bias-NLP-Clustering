Chris Keane/Reuters\n\nHillary Clinton has yet to release a full tax plan, but her campaign said Friday that she won\u2019t raise taxes on families earning less than $250,000.\n\nClinton spokesman Brian Fallon said Mrs. Clinton will find ways to pay for her proposals that do not require tax increases on these families. \u201cIn paying for her proposals, she fundamentally rejects the idea that we should be willing to raise taxes on middle-class households,\u201d he said in a statement first provided to the Washington Post.\n\nIn one respect, her position is not surprising. This was her pledge as a presidential candidate in 2008. Then-Sen. Barack Obama, her opponent, made the same pledge.\n\nBut the promise marks a contrast with Mrs. Clinton\u2019s opponents this year.\n\nHer chief rival, Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent, is focused on increasing taxes on the wealthy. But at least one of his major proposals\u2013a single-payer health care program\u2013would almost certainly require a broad-based tax to fund it. The tradeoff would be that employers and employees would no longer have to pay for health care through the workplace anymore, and all Americans would be covered by insurance, a guarantee that the Affordable Care Act does not provide.\n\nMr. Sanders and a third candidate, former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley, also support a family leave fund that depends on a small payroll tax.\n\nThe question of how each candidate intends to pay for his or her proposals is likely to be aired in Saturday night\u2019s Democratic presidential debate. Mrs. Clinton may seek to turn a debate over whose proposals are best into a discussion of how they will be funded.\n\nOne estimate of single-payer health care puts the additional cost to the federal government at some $15 trillion over 10 years. Combined with his other proposals, Mr. Sanders\u2019s ideas would cost a total of more than $18 trillion over a decade.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Hillary Clinton's campaign said Friday that she won't raise taxes on families earning less than $250,000.", "title": "Clinton Vows Not to Raise Taxes on Families Earning Less Than $250,000", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/11/13/clinton-vows-not-to-raise-taxes-on-families-earning-less-than-250000/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-LG266_DEMSjp_P_20151113174254.jpg"}, "site": "WSJPolitics", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Politics", "article.headline": "Clinton Vows Not to Raise Taxes on Families Earning Less Than $250,000", "description": "Hillary Clinton's campaign said Friday that she won't raise taxes on families earning less than $250,000.", "article_section": "Politics", "author": "Laura Meckler", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Washington Wire Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Washington Wire", "article.summary": "Hillary Clinton's campaign said Friday that she won't raise taxes on families earning less than $250,000.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2015-11-13T23:30:03-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-139", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/11/13/clinton-vows-not-to-raise-taxes-on-families-earning-less-than-250000/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-WB-59234", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Politics", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Hillary Clinton's campaign said Friday that she won't raise taxes on families earning less than $250,000.", "title": "Clinton Vows Not to Raise Taxes on Families Earning Less Than $250,000", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/11/13/clinton-vows-not-to-raise-taxes-on-families-earning-less-than-250000/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-LG266_DEMSjp_P_20151113174254.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Washington Wire", "article.id": "BL-WB-59234", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-11-13T23:30:35-05:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe166a\"", "article_summary": "Chris Keane/ReutersHillary Clinton has yet to release a full tax plan, but her campaign said Friday that she won\u2019t raise taxes on families earning less than $250,000.\nClinton spokesman Brian Fallon said Mrs. Clinton will find ways to pay for her proposals that do not require tax increases on these families.\nOne estimate of single-payer health care puts the additional cost to the federal government at some $15 trillion over 10 years.\nMrs. Clinton may seek to turn a debate over whose proposals are best into a discussion of how they will be funded.\nBut at least one of his major proposals\u2013a single-payer health care program\u2013would almost certainly require a broad-based tax to fund it."}
