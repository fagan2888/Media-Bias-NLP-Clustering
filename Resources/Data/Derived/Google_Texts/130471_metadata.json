Halbert\n\nFORECASTS & TRENDS E-LETTER\n\nby Gary D. Halbert\n\nFebruary 9, 2016\n\nIN THIS ISSUE:\n\nUnemployment Rate Fell to 4.9% But New Jobs Disappointed Obamacare\u2019s Exploding Health Insurance Premiums 2015 Rise in Healthcare Costs Dwarfs All Other Sectors Special Report: UNDERSTANDING & MAXIMIZING YOUR 401(K) Niemann Capital Management Webinar February 18 at 2:00CST\n\nOverview\n\nToday I want to address the soaring costs of healthcare, which are rising far more than the Obama administration and the Department of Health and Human Services will admit. While I personally don\u2019t consider healthcare costs to be a political issue, many argue that it is indeed a political issue with regard to \u201cObamacare.\u201d\n\nWhen talking to friends and colleagues, the most frequent comment I get is something like: Obamacare health insurance premiums are much higher than the government says they are \u2013 what gives? Today, I will answer that question with some new facts from an independent non-profit on healthcare premiums around the country. Prepare to be surprised.\n\nThe Obama administration\u2019s Health and Human Services Department (HHS) announced on January 21 that healthcare premiums on the Affordable Care Act exchanges rose an average of only 9% from 2015 to 2016. That was highly misleading since the HHS data covered less than half of all consumers buying healthcare on the federal exchanges in the last year.\n\nThe real premium increases, almost across-the-board, are substantially higher in most states this year. A new, independent report from the Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce includes the weighted-average premiums for all plans available on the Affordable Care Act\u2019s exchanges.\n\nThe findings will shock you, or maybe not, if you have recently renewed your healthcare coverage. In that case, you may already know, especially depending on where you live. In any event, that\u2019s what we\u2019ll talk about today.\n\nWe will also talk about how healthcare costs are by far the fastest growing subset of the US economy. And that\u2019s putting it lightly. The increase in healthcare cost almost doubled the next fastest growing sector\u2019s cost growth last year. Can you say, out-of-control?\n\nBut before we get to that discussion, let\u2019s take a look at last Friday\u2019s unemployment report for January. The headline unemployment rate dropped to 4.9%, the lowest level since early 2008, but some of the internal numbers were mixed or disappointing.\n\nUnemployment Rate Fell to 4.9% But New Jobs Disappointed\n\nLast Friday\u2019s jobs report for January was a bag of mixed signals. New job creation slowed more than expected, but rising wages and an unemployment rate at an eight-year low suggested the labor market recovery remains firm.\n\nNon-farm payrolls increased by only 151,000 jobs last month, well below the pre-report consensus of 190,000 and sharply lower than the 231,000 monthly average in the 4Q of last year. The good news was that the headline unemployment rate fell to 4.9%, the lowest since February 2008.\n\nOn the other hand, the broader \u201cunder-employment\u201d measure, which includes a larger swath of jobless workers plus part-time workers who need full-time jobs, remained stuck at 9.9%, indicating substantial slack remains in the job market.\n\nOther positive internals included the 0.5% increase in average hourly pay, the largest monthly gain in a year to $25.39 an hour. The average hourly workweek saw a nice increase, and the Labor Force Participation Rate increased slightly from 62.6% in December to 62.7% last month. Despite that, the Participation Rate remains the lowest in almost 38 years.\n\nIf I had to sum-up the January jobs report, I would rate it a disappointment, especially with new jobs reaching only 151,000 versus the consensus estimate of 190,000. Yes, the fact that the unemployment rate fell to the lowest level in eight years at 4.9% is a positive development. The bottom line: We\u2019ll have to wait for the February jobs report in early March to see if a new trend is emerging, one way or the other.\n\nLikewise, the mixed readings in the January jobs report tell us very little about whether the Fed intends to go ahead with more rate hikes this year.\n\nNow let\u2019s move on to our main topic this week \u2013 runaway healthcare costs.\n\nObamacare\u2019s Exploding Health Insurance Premiums\n\nOn January 21, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced that health insurance premiums on the Affordable Care Act exchanges rose an average of only 9% from 2015 to 2016. Yet the HHS data account for less than half of individual consumers buying coverage in the 38 states using the federal exchange.\n\nThe overall premium increases were significantly higher.\n\nFreedom Partners Chamber of Commerce, a non-profit organization, has analyzed all publicly available information for health insurance premiums from healthcare.gov and state insurance departments.\n\nIt then calculated the weighted-averages for all health insurance plans available on the Affordable Care Act\u2019s exchanges. The weighted-average gives a more accurate view of overall premium increases, because it takes into account each insurance plan\u2019s market share.\n\nThe findings: Nationally, premiums for individual health plans increased on average between 2015 and 2016 by 14.9% .\n\nConsumers in every state except Mississippi faced increased premiums, and in no fewer than 29 states the average increases were in the double digits. For a third of states, the average premiums rose 20% or more.\n\nHealth-insurance premiums rose by more than 30% in Alaska and Hawaii; Oregon\u2019s average rate increase was 23.2%. Consumers in Kansas, Missouri, Iowa and Illinois faced increases exceeding 20% on average.\n\nThe East Coast north of Maryland was the least hard hit (New York\u2019s average premium increase was 6%), although Pennsylvania and New Jersey consumers faced premium increases of 14.6% and 13.1% respectively.\n\nIn 11 of the 16 states defined as southern by the US Census Bureau, premiums rose by more than 10%. Premiums rose on average by 13.9%, and by more than 20% in West Virginia, Alabama, North Carolina and Oklahoma. In Texas, where data was only available for 98.5% of individual-market healthcare plans, premiums rose by 14.1%.\n\nAverage premiums in Tennessee rose 35.2% \u2013 mostly because of the state\u2019s largest individual market insurer, BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee, which sold 82% of all exchange plans in 2015. After losing $141 million on these plans last year, the company had little choice but to request average premium increases of 36.3%. The state insurance commission largely approved this request, lest the company leave the exchange altogether and leave 231,000 Tennesseans in the lurch.\n\nMinnesota holds the dubious honor of having the highest year-over-year premium increases, 47.7%. Why? Because that state\u2019s BlueCross BlueShield, the largest insurer, with over 90% of the market, lost tens of millions of dollars during the Affordable Care Act\u2019s first two years. The company requested an average 49% rate increase, which was largely approved by state regulators.\n\nRemember: These premium increases are only one piece of the health-care cost puzzle. Deductibles are also rising under the Affordable Care Act. Silver plans \u2013 the most popular on the exchanges \u2013 have average deductibles of nearly $3,000 in 2016, according to the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. This represents an 8% increase over last year.\n\nMillions of Americans are coming to believe that the Affordable Care Act\u2019s costs far outweigh its benefits. In 2014, the latest year for which data is available, roughly\n\nSign up for our free newsletter", "article_metadata": {"description": "I could go on and on but I\u2019ll leave this section here for today.
