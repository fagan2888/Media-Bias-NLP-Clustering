She went through two lengthy rounds of chemotherapy, and each time the tumors roared back. Her future looked grim. That is until doctors at Roswell Park Cancer Institute made McCann a \u201cpersonalized medicine\u201d guinea pig. Today, McCann\u2019s cancer is manageable \u2013 six years after a diagnosis that kills most patients within five years. McCann\u2019s treatment is part of a Roswell Park program that reflects a reinvention of cancer care \u2013 and that could put the Buffalo cancer center in the forefront of the new world of personalized medicine. With $20 million of its own money and $5 million from the state to create the program, Roswell Park has built an advanced test that could be one of the most reliable and efficient ways to analyze cancer patients\u2019 genes. Called OmniSeq Target, the new test lets doctors customize treatment to an individual\u2019s tumor and the underlying molecular changes causing the cancer. In McCann\u2019s case, identifying the genetic mutations that were driving her lung cancer let doctors give her a drug aimed at the mutation, not the tumors in her lungs Roswell Park developed the new approach for lung cancer and sees it as a potential financial success, and researchers are working to extend it to other cancers. Now, it must coax insurers to pay for OmniSeq. Targeted genetic therapy remains a work in progress. No one knows yet if personalized medicine can fulfill its promise or how much it will cost. So far, insurers have treated tests like the one developed by Roswell Park warily because their results can steer patients toward costly experimental therapies that don\u2019t have a proven pay off. Roswell Park isn\u2019t alone. Universities, big companies and health centers with more money and manpower are chasing the same goal. But with OmniSeq, the cancer center believes it has a test that, for the moment, is ahead of the pack. \u201cWe asked ourselves, what kind of test would most appeal to the individual doctor?\u201d says Dr. Carl Morrison, executive director of Roswell Park\u2019s new Center for Personalized Medicine. \u201cAnd we tried to apply Wayne Gretzky\u2019s line about why he was so good at hockey. He skated to where the puck was going to be, not to where it had been.\u201d That gives Roswell Park a chance to compete for an even bigger prize: Using the test to develop drugs that target the gene mutations. \u201cOmniSeq is the bat that can help Roswell Park hit a home run. The home run is coming up with the treatments,\u201d said Dr. Frank Dubeck, vice president for medical policy at Univera Healthcare.\n\nGenetic approach For decades, cancer treatment has centered on the organ where a tumor is found in the body. People suffer from cancer of the lungs, breasts or colon, for instance. They receive standard chemotherapies that attack tumors but also damage healthy cells. In personalized medicine, every person\u2019s cancer looks as unique as a fingerprint. \u201cGenes don\u2019t care what kind of cancer you have,\u201d Morrison said. Every cell in our body contains DNA, the genetic instructions to make and operate an organism. DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, looks like a twisted ladder, with the steps comprising pairs of four chemicals. Human DNA contains about 3 billion of those steps arranged in a certain order. A gene is a section of DNA with certain functions. When mistakes or changes occur in a gene\u2019s DNA, cancer and other diseases can result. People are excited about personalized medicine for good reason: Finding genetic defects to diagnose or treat cancers and other diseases is no longer science fiction. It took an international effort known as the Human Genome Project 13 years and $3 billion to sequence the first human genome, figuring out the exact order of a person\u2019s genetic information. Today, it is possible to sequence a person\u2019s genes in a few days for a few thousand dollars, and the cost and time continue to drop. Challenges remain, but experts say the technology for accurate, high-speed genetic sequencing \u2013 combined with the computing capability to store the mountain of information and make sense of the genetic complexities \u2013 appears on the verge of moving from research centers into the mainstream of medical practice. As the cost becomes more affordable, the thinking goes, large numbers of tumor genomes can be deciphered, giving the world a database for comparison of how conditions develop and what drugs work best to treat them. \u201cThis is the reality of where health care is moving,\u201d said Edward Abrahams, president of the Personalized Medicine Coalition in Washington, D.C., an advocacy organization that includes diagnostic test-makers, pharmaceutical companies, patient groups, and research institutions. \u201cIt\u2019s actually already here and making a difference in the lives of patients.\u201d\n\nNext-generation tests The seed for OmniSeq \u2013 pronounced \u201comni-seek\u201d \u2013 was planted in 2012, when the Western New York Regional Economic Development Council, one of 10 regional councils Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo appointed to spur economic development, awarded $5.1 million for a new Center for Personalized Medicine at Roswell Park. The cancer center invested $20 million of its own to hire staff, install a supercomputer and buy devices called sequencers to analyze genes. With that infrastructure in place, a team of 15 people worked to develop the test. Next-generation tests like OmniSeq are considered game-changers because they can quickly search for multiple alterations. Foundation Medicine in Cambridge, Mass., for instance, markets a $5,800 test that searches for 315 cancer-related genes. Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City has developed a test for its patients that looks at 341 cancer-related genes. Foundation Medicine and others see an advantage in simultaneously examining hundreds of genetic alterations, despite many of them currently lacking a treatment. Roswell Park took a different approach. OmniSeq looks only at the 23 known mutations related to lung cancer for which there is an approved drug, an experimental drug or a drug for another cancer that can be used off-label. The institute envisions similar tests for other cancers as the science advances, with doctors and hospitals sending tumor tissue samples to the cancer center for analysis. Which idea is the better one? It\u2019s a little like the videotape format battle between Beta and VHS, although, in this case, both concepts may survive. OmniSeq sits on the edge of a new frontier in medicine and a market big enough to create multiple winners. The McKinsey Global Institute, the research arm of the McKinsey & Co. consulting firm, last year estimated the potential economic impact of next-generation gene sequencing in health care, agriculture and biofuels at $700 billion to $1.6 trillion a year by 2025, with about 80 percent of the value in the medical field. \u201cWe\u2019re on the cusp of something big,\u201d Deputy Director Dr. Candace Johnson said about personalized medicine. She said the cost of OmniSeq will compare with FoundationOne\u2019s test. Until health plans reimburse, donors have stepped in to help cover the price of the test for cancer center patients who can\u2019t afford it. Roswell Park is betting that insurers and doctors will favor a narrowly focused test. The institute cleared a major hurdle in June when the New York State Health Department approved FoundationOne and OmniSeq, allowing doctors to use them. With a lack of federal test standards so far, New York\u2019s decision is viewed as an unofficial national seal of approval concerning the reliability of the test results.\n\nWooing insurers Reimbursement is the next step. Roswell Park officials hope insurers, starting in Western New York, will decide to cover OmniSeq. Insurers see the demand for personalized medicine growing, and it looks chaotic. How do you decide whether to pay for a costly treatment for a gene defect when there is little or no information yet about whether the treatment will improve overall outcomes? How much should you pay for a test when it may not be possible to act on most of the results? How do you do compare the safety and efficacy of targeted drugs against standard therapies with such small subgroups of patients? Dubeck said OmniSeq and other next-generation sequencing tests will shake up the health care industry. \u201cThere are six to eight genes in OmniSeq we would probably pay for based on current guidelines. The question is what do you do about the other mutations? We don\u2019t pay for experimental treatments. You need data to prove that a drug has clinical utility,\u201d he said. \u201cWe see the potential of next-generation sequencing,\u201d he said. \u201cBut insurers have to focus on value.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sharon McCann took care of herself and never smoked a cigarette, so she was shocked in 2009 when an X-ray detected lung cancer.
