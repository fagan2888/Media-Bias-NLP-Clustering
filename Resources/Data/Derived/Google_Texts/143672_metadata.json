That lets Dems vote for it to provide political cover for themselves without expecting it to actually become the \"law of the land\".\n\nThis is exactly what Obama tried to head off with his bizarre rambling press conference. It's not a full repeal, but it begins the process of freeing Americans from ObamaCare. And so Obama is trying to scramble for a solution.\n\nMeanwhile the bill has decisively passed in the House by 261-157 with 39 Democratic congressmen defecting to the health care freedom side.\n\nRepresentative Fred Upton, Republican of Michigan and the chief sponsor of the House bill, said his legislation would fulfill a promise that Mr. Obama had made to the American people and then broken. \u201cIn the last three years,\u201d Mr. Upton said, \u201cthe president personally promised that if people liked their current health care plan, they could keep it \u2018no matter what.\u2019 But cancellation notices are now arriving in millions of mailboxes across the country. It\u2019s cancellation today, sticker shock tomorrow.\u201d Representative Jim McGovern, Democrat of Massachusetts, said Mr. Upton\u2019s bill was an attempt to \u201cdrag us back to the bad old days of the American health care system.\u201d\n\nThe bad old days when people were able to easily and affordably buy health insurance. Those bad old days when you could be a 70-year-old man buying a policy that didn't cover maternity or sex changes and cost a fraction of what it does today under ObamaCare.\n\nRep. Nick J. Rahall II (W.Va.), a 19-term veteran targeted in 2014 by Republicans, said ads are running against him in his district based on the president\u2019s promise to allow Americans to keep their health-care plans. \u201cI\u2019m concerned about my integrity with voters that have returned me [for] 38 years. They know me enough to know I wouldn\u2019t purposely mislead them and that I\u2019m an honest, straight shooter,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have that confidence in me, and I want to continue for them to have that confidence in me. I just need to find the answers myself.\u201d\n\nRahall's answer was to vote for the Keep Your Plan Act.\n\n\u201cA lot of us felt there was no sense of urgency to get this done,\u201d said Rep. Mike Doyle (Pa.), a reliable liberal vote, who had publicly threatened to back the Upton bill unless the White House and leadership responded.\n\nDoyle remained a reliable liberal vote by voting not to let people keep their plans.", "article_metadata": {"rating": "general", "description": "Jim McGovern, Democrat of Massachusetts, said it was an attempt to \u201cdrag us back to the bad old days of the American health care system.\u201d", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Frontpage Mag", "description": "Jim McGovern, Democrat of Massachusetts, said it was an attempt to \u201cdrag us back to the bad old days of the American health care system.\u201d", "title": "39 Dems Defect to Vote for \"Keep Your Plan\" Act that Obama Vows to Veto", "url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/point/210824/39-dems-defect-vote-keep-your-plan-act-obama-vows-daniel-greenfield", "updated_time": "2015-06-22T23:48:41-04:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/point/210824/39-dems-defect-vote-keep-your-plan-act-obama-vows-daniel-greenfield", "description": "Jim McGovern, Democrat of Massachusetts, said it was an attempt to \u201cdrag us back to the bad old days of the American health care system.\u201d", "card": "summary", "title": "39 Dems Defect to Vote for \"Keep Your Plan\" Act that Obama Vows to Veto"}, "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-15T10:32:21-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-22T23:48:41-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd6147\"", "article_summary": "Obama has already warned that he will veto the Keep Your Plan Act.\nI just need to find the answers myself.\u201dRahall's answer was to vote for the Keep Your Plan Act.\nThat lets Dems vote for it to provide political cover for themselves without expecting it to actually become the \"law of the land\".\nThose bad old days when you could be a 70-year-old man buying a policy that didn't cover maternity or sex changes and cost a fraction of what it does today under ObamaCare.\nMeanwhile the bill has decisively passed in the House by 261-157 with 39 Democratic congressmen defecting to the health care freedom side."}
