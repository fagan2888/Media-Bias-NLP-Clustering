(AP) \u2014 A second city on Tuesday withdrew its invitation for Rhode Island\u2019s \u201cDancing Cop\u201d to direct holiday traffic because of his activism against the Black Lives Matter movement. The retired officer responded by blasting the head of the Providence NAACP and threatening to sue his detractors for defamation.\n\nEast Providence Mayor Thomas Rose called Tony Lepore on Tuesday morning to tell him city leaders did not support his planned performance, Lepore said. A City Council vote that had been scheduled for Tuesday evening was canceled.\n\nLepore, who retired from the Providence Police Department in 1989, has been directing traffic with dance moves since 1984. His act became a holiday tradition in Providence. But city officials told Lepore last month they were letting him go after he organized a small protest outside a coffee shop where a worker wrote \u201c#blacklivesmatter\u201d on another officer\u2019s cup.\n\nOfficials in neighboring East Providence then invited Lepore to perform, but that sparked a protest attended by dozens of people, including Providence NAACP President Jim Vincent.\n\nBoth men said Tuesday they are longtime friends who know each other because they film TV shows in the same studio, and both said they were shocked by the other\u2019s actions.\n\nLepore told WPRO-AM that Vincent should be embarrassed.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t represent what Martin Luther King Jr. wanted your organization to be,\u201d he said.\n\nVincent responded by saying in an interview that he is saddened by the situation. He said police relations with communities are tenuous throughout the country, and that he and others have worked with police to make sure Rhode Island doesn\u2019t become the next Ferguson, Missouri.\n\n\u201cHe would be the last person I would think that would cause harm and division in the community, which is basically what he did,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cWe don\u2019t need anything to make things worse. He made things worse. He ended up being divisive, maybe unintentionally.\u201d\n\nHe called it a \u201cwise decision\u201d to rescind Lepore\u2019s invitation in East Providence.\n\nLepore said in an interview later Tuesday that while he disagrees with Vincent, he has no hard feelings toward him. But he said he wants to sue the city of Providence \u201cand whoever else my lawyer wants to go after\u201d for defamation of character.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re trying to say I\u2019m a racist,\u201d Lepore said.\n\nThe controversy hurt his business, he said, and he worried appearances he had been invited to in 2016 would dry up. But he said he does not regret his coffee shop protest.\n\n\u2014 Written by Michelle R. Smith\n\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
