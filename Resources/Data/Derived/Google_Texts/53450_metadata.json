Click here for the entire series.\n\nMillions of Americans who need mental health care don\u2019t get it. And that creates a public health nightmare \u2013 for jails, homeless shelters, emergency rooms, and most importantly, for the individuals themselves.\n\nThe Magic Pill, Part 1: The Good, The Bad, The Open Questions\n\nKatia Crosby has an MBA, a townhouse in Ellicott City, a daughter and a mental illness.\n\nShe was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when she was 22 and had her first manic episode when she was 35. Three years ago she lost her job as a senior IT project manager, her health insurance and much of her family and friends, \u201cThey see with a different lens now \u2013 the trust factor isn\u2019t there \u2013 they can\u2019t trust my stability. Therefore, I\u2019m untrustworthy.\u201d Crosby, 38, sits at her kitchen table, lights off on a rainy day, her braids fall around her face. She sounds angry, but determined. \u201cI still have to go on,\u201d she says, \u201cI suffer from the repercussions of that exacerbation. It still comes with a cost.\u201d\n\nThe costs were both emotional and financial. She couldn\u2019t pay the mortgage without a roommate and she couldn\u2019t find health insurance; not with that \u201cpre-existing condition.\u201d In the past three years, she\u2019s been to hospital emergency rooms five times for mental health care.\n\nCrosby is among 45.6 million adults in the country with some form of mental illness. Estimates say less than half get the treatment they need.\n\nSo, advocates, patients, and doctors are asking if the ACA, also known as \u201cObamacare,\u201d is good for mental health care.\n\nMark Komrad, a psychiatrist in private practice and the chairman of ethics at Sheppard Pratt Hospital in Towson, says there are a lot of things that are good and some that are problematic and they will lessen the good.\n\nAmong the good things: mental health care is one of the \u201cessential health benefits\u201d that must be included in every plan offered on Maryland\u2019s Health Exchange, right along with mammograms and annual check-ups. And it must be offered with the same level of visits and deductibles as other medical treatments. Komrad says, \u201cthat\u2019s huge because of the years I\u2019ve seen people who thought they had care, had insurance, but it turns out it did not cover mental health services.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s another thing: No one can be denied coverage because of a \u201cpre-existing condition,\u201d so people like Katia Crosby are now eligible.\n\nAnd Medicaid will expand in Maryland to cover more people.\n\nAndrew Sperling from NAMI, National Alliance on Mental Illness, says the cost offset is clear, \u201cwe know \u2013 we are absolutely certain \u2013 that the costs of untreated mental illness are enormous.\u201d Providing more access to mental health care is a VERY smart thing to do, he explains, \u201cWhen someone with schizophrenia is not getting access to treatment and they become acutely psychotic, the burden is shifted to other systems: criminal justice, the homeless service system, emergency medical services \u2013 all types of systems bear the brunt of those costs of untreated mental illness.\u201d\n\nBut there are other problems the ACA doesn\u2019t tackle. Analysts with the federal government say there\u2019s a serious shortage of mental health care professionals. And only a fraction of those actually accept health insurance.\n\nCarolyn Quattrocki, from the Governor\u2019s Office of Healthcare Reform, says the ACA is a start, but there\u2019s still a long way to go to delivering mental health care to the one in five families who need it. She says her work is nowhere near done, \u201caccess to coverage does not always mean access to care\u201d. She says they need the right kind of providers in the right place at the right time to have a chance.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Maryland", "description": "This story is the first installment in a five-part series on mental health care.
