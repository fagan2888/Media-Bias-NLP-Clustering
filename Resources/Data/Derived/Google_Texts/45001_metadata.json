Throughout the last month, Ready for Hillary has promoted the bill on Facebook, where the PAC has 1 million followers, and late last month, it asked supporters to sign an online petition to \u201cstand with Hillary in protecting Obamacare.\u201d\n\nReady for Hillary was founded last January with one main mission \u2014 to build grassroots support for Clinton\u2019s potential bid for president in 2016 \u2014 but has expanded its reach considerably in the eight months since it registered with the Federal Election Committee.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s how we see it,\u201d said Seth Bringman, the group\u2019s communications director. \u201cIt\u2019s 2013 and we\u2019re mobilizing a grassroots army to encourage Hillary to run in 2016. There are also big priorities for our party and our country right now, like elections in 2013 and 2014, and issues like Obamacare and the Voting Rights Act,\u201d he said, noting Clinton herself has spoken out in recent weeks on both issues.\n\nIn a speech at Yale Law School last Sunday, Clinton invoked what she called the \u201chuman costs of political brinksmanship and gridlock in Washington,\u201d echoing remarks she made about Obamacare to an audience at the Clinton Global Initiative conference last month. \u201cI find the debate over this issue to be quite unfortunate,\u201d she said at the New York meeting. \u201cA law was passed. It was upheld by the Supreme Court. It is the law of the land.\u201d\n\nReady for Hillary is building a massive list of supporters online, primarily through social media websites, and has also amassed public support from big-name Clinton confidants like James Carville, Harold Ickes, and Susie Tompkins Buell. But with months until Clinton makes up her mind about a presidential bid \u2014 and years until the actual election \u2014 the PAC has looked for other ways to keep its supporters engaged in the interim, expanding the traditional role of most draft-movement groups.\n\nLast month, the PAC also announced it would look for ways to weigh in on the 2014 midterm elections \u2014 but only in support of candidates Clinton endorses. The group told The Hill they would start with Terry McAuliffe, a longtime close friend of the Clintons and the Democratic candidate for governor in Virginia.\n\nAlthough the group doesn\u2019t have \u201cconcrete\u201d plans for further action on the Affordable Care Act in the coming weeks, aides say they\u2019ll continue to look for opportunities to \u201camplify issues that Hillary and President Clinton are out there talking about.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur supporters care deeply about these priorities in addition to wanting Hillary to run in 2016, so we want to give them opportunities to get engaged,\u201d Bringman said. \u201cWhen it comes to Obamacare, we are making sure our supporters know that the marketplaces opened this week, encouraging them to sign up if they aren\u2019t covered, and asking them to spread the word.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"bf": {"buzzid": 2655975, "userid": 230577}, "google-signin-clientid": "895639880237-tcoheof19odpd88p676rjc70v0iqit0o.apps.googleusercontent.com", "description": "While it waits for 2016, the major pro-Clinton group takes on current battles. \"There are also big priorities for our party and our country...", "copyright": "Copyright 2016 BuzzFeed, Inc.
