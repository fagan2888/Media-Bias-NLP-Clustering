The conversation [about waivers], we believe, is absolutely important.\"\n\nForty-three states and Washington, D.C., use at least one Medicaid Section 1115 waiver, according to the brief, which was authored by analysts at the University of Massachusetts' Center for Health Law and Economics.\n\nThe waiver, according to the brief, lets states disregard many aspects of their Medicaid plan if the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services determine it makes sense and is cost effective.\n\nThe waiver can let states raise income eligibility limits and add benefits that aren't usually covered by Medicaid, among other things. Once states apply for the waiver, it usually takes months or years to negotiate terms and gain approval, according to the brief.\n\nOn Aug. 31, some Connecticut residents lost their ability to qualify for HUSKY A, state Medicaid that covers low-income children and teens, under a state law that changed income eligibility standards. The change lowered the income eligibility level for parents and caregivers\u2014from 201 percent to 155 percent of the federal poverty level\u2014meaning those earning more than 155 percent of the poverty level no longer can receive HUSKY A.\n\nIf Connecticut were to pursue it, the state would need to file an application with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Legislative approval is not required.\n\nThe forthcoming ACA 1332 waiver will let states opt out of major components of the Affordable Care Act, including the mandate that a state-run marketplace (Access Health CT) exist. To get the waiver, states will have to prove that alternative programs would provide equally comprehensive coverage to a comparable number of people without increasing the federal deficit, according to the brief.\n\nThe brief outlines potential pitfalls to using the waivers. Among them: state finances could be at risk if projected federal revenue to support programs falls short; political changes could jeopardize waiver programs that require federal approval; and using waivers could hurt Access Health's clout and financing base by taking people out of the marketplace.\n\n\"There's always the good, the bad and the ugly,\" Padilla said, so any waiver needs to be researched before deciding whether to proceed.\n\nConnecticut currently participates in 11 Medicaid waiver programs, according to David Dearborn, spokesman for the Department of Social Services (DSS) that administers the state's Medicaid program. DSS has overall responsibility for the waivers, he said, but five of them are under DSS directly, five are under the state Department of Developmental Services and one is under the Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services. Connecticut's existing waivers pertain to early childhood autism, acquired brain injuries, personal attendants and a state home care program for elders, among other things, Dearborn said.\n\nUsing the waivers has made the state a \"national leader\" when it comes to \"creative and effective ways of adapting Medicaid rules\" to provide home- and community-based services to people who otherwise would need nursing home care or institutionalization, he said.\n\n\"There's already a lot of positive action going in Connecticut,\" he said, with the state taking innovative steps to expand Medicaid's reach.\n\nSimilarly, even more state residents could potentially access services under ACA Section 1332 and Medicaid Section 1115 waivers, Baker said.\n\n\"There's nothing intrinsically good or bad about waivers, but they are an opportunity that this state should explore,\" she said.\n\nThis story was reported under a partnership with the Connecticut Health I-Team (www.c-hit.org).", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Federal Waivers Could Make Health Insurance Accessible, Affordable", "date": "2016-01-25", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Hartford Courant", "author": "Hartford Courant", "og": {"site_name": "courant.com", "description": "Health insurance coverage might be more accessible and affordable in Connecticut if the state applied for certain Affordable Care Act and Medicaid waivers, according to advocates who say the options should be explored.", "title": "Federal Waivers Could Make Health Insurance Accessible, Affordable", "url": "http://www.courant.com/health/hc-medicaid-waivers-connecticut-20160125-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5418224f/turbine/hc-hartford-default-fb-icon", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp07.14", "twitter": {"site": "@hartfordcourant", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=391113483, app-argument=http://www.courant.com/deeplinkid/85685955", "fb": {"admins": 14500562, "page_id": 49693986601, "app_id": 152391743139}, "googlebot-news": "index", "keywords": "Federal Waivers Health Insurance", "news_keywords": "Federal Waivers Health Insurance", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "Description": "Health insurance coverage might be more accessible and affordable in Connecticut if the state applied for certain Affordable Care Act and Medicaid waivers, according to advocates who say the options should be explored.
