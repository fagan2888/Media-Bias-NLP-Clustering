(WHNT) \u2013 An idea to rezone land in Madison for a new high-end shopping mall and a possible new school is not going over well with residents who live nearby.\n\nSome residents are upset over how such projects would affect their way of life and they\u2019re pushing a petition to stop it.\n\nThe Park Meadow neighborhood sits right across the road from what is now a wheat field in land zoned for residential building. That\u2019s how two women on a mission want it to stay.\n\n\u201cRezoning this and putting a shopping center, an exta school and right next to all our houses, to me, is not a good idea,\u201d said Sue Thorn, a resident of Park Meadow.\n\nShe and her sister, Eva Walding, who also lives in the neighborhood, worry about the effects of re-zoning the land at Brownsferry Road and Wall Triana Boulevard. They believe it would devalue their homes and worsening traffic in the area.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of traffic on this road at anytime,\u201d said Walding. \u201cBut at times.. at high traffic times, you almost cannot get out of this neighborhood\u2026 it\u2019s difficult to get into the traffic.\u201d\n\nThe two women started an online petition a few days ago and already it has more than 120 signatures.\n\nThey argue while building a brand new shopping center may sound exciting, there are already existing centers that need help.\n\n\u201cWe have quite a few store fronts already vacant, rundown strip centers already,\u201d said Thorn. \u201cI would love to see those rebuilt up and concentrate on getting something into those empty ones.\u201d\n\nNothing has been decided.\n\nTwo members of the City of Madison Planning Commission, Mike Potter and Tim Holcombe, who represent the area on the Madison City Council, have said they are listening to all sides of the issue before they make a decision to encourage the move or not.\n\nThe planning commission will meet to consider the idea and hear from the public on Thursday, June 19 at 5:30pm at the Madison City Hall on Hughes Road.\n\nIt\u2019s open to the public. Members may decide whether or not to recommend the move to the entire city council.", "article_metadata": {"description": "MADISON, Ala.
