For the most part, these bacteria live in harmony with our bodies, eating what we eat, and regulating our metabolism and energy. But when they\u2019re not living in peace, they may be causing disease, as one new Cleveland Clinic study found; a byproduct of their digestion may influence a person\u2019s heart health.\n\nThe byproduct, trimethylamine N-oxide, or TMAO, is produced when gut bacteria digest the amino acid carnitine, which is commonly found in animal food products like beef, fish, chicken, milk, and cheese. The body already produces carnitine, and stores it in almost every cell in the body, where it\u2019s used to produce energy. Because of this, it\u2019s not really necessary to get more. The new study found that once gut bacteria produced TMAO, it traveled to the bloodstream where it clogged arteries, leading to heart failure and overall worse outcomes.\n\n\u201cI am excited that these studies suggest TMAO testing may not only help identify those patients at greatest risk, and for whom more aggressive monitoring is needed, but also that TMAO testing may help to tailor dietary efforts to the individual in the hopes of reducing future risks among those high-risk subjects,\u201d said Dr. W.H. Wilson Tang, of the Department of Cardiovascular Medicine at the Miller Family Heart and Vascular Institute, in a press release.\n\nFor the study, the researchers followed 720 heart failure patients over the course of five years. They found that there were lower mortality rates when there were high levels of natriuretic peptides, a compound indicative of heart failure, and low levels of TMAO, when compared to patients who had high levels of both. The findings, that TMAO contributed to heart failure and death, were further supported when they found that high levels of TMAO and BNP \u2014 another peptide indicative of heart failure \u2014 increased risk of death by 50 percent.\n\nTang\u2019s study builds on a study from 2013, in which he found that TMAO also contributed to a person\u2019s risk of heart disease and stroke, even if a person has no history of either. Though the researchers aren\u2019t suggesting we all stop eating meat, their findings support previous claims that red meat consumption should be limited \u2014 and they have good reason to suggest that. \u201cA diet high in carnitine shifts our gut \u2018biology\u2019 so meat eaters actually generate more TMAO and compound their risk of cardiovascular disease,\u201d Cleveland Clinic\u2019s website says.\n\nHeart failure is very common, affecting 5.1 million people in the U.S., according to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. It develops over time and causes the heart to weaken, making it harder for blood to flow to some parts of the body. In turn, a person\u2019s extremities can swell, they can have trouble breathing, or feel tired.\n\nSource: Tang WH, Hazen S, et al.
