The Chicago Board of Elections is reminding people that Tuesday is the last day to register to be able to vote hassle-free in the March 15 primary.

Potential voters can register online here, provided they have an Illinois driver’s license or state identification card. They also can use a form found here to register by mail, if it’s postmarked no later than Tuesday. And the board will allow folks to register in person from 8 a.m. to 11:59 p.m. Tuesday on the sixth floor at 69 W. Washington St.

If potential voters miss the deadline, they still have the option of registering at early and Election Day polling places at the same time as their vote is cast, provided they bring two forms of accepted identification, one with their current address.

Early voting is scheduled to start Wednesday at 69 W. Washington, said Jim Allen, spokesman for the board. On Feb. 29, additional early voting sites will be opened in each of the city’s 50 wards.

Allen also is reminding 17-year-olds that they can vote in the primary if they will turn 18 by Nov. 8, the day of the general election.

So far, there are about 1.5 million people registered to vote in the city, Allen said. That’s about 200,000 more than four years ago during the last presidential election cycle. (Hal Dardick)

From the notebook

*Mansion money: Private donors have contributed $1 million to help restore the crumbling Illinois Executive Mansion, which faced years of neglect under previous administrations but has become the subject of a fundraising campaign run by first lady Diana Rauner.

So far, the building's roof has been replaced at a price tag of $493,000, though it's estimated it'll cost an additonal $8 million to $12 million to make needed repairs and renovations elsewhere, according to the Illinois Executive Mansion Association. Completed in 1855, the mansion has not undergone a major overhaul since 1972.

At one point, there was black mold growing in the basement, plaster fell from the ceiling and rainwater leaked into the Lincoln bedroom so often that furniture was covered in tarps and buckets were set up to catch drips.

Still, Gov. Rauner, who stays at the mansion when in Springfield, joked that it was in better condition than his frat house — a statement that may have been an exaggeration given a survey last year by the Illinois Capital Development Board.

"The current condition of the mansion is, at best, marginally acceptable for conducting business of the state and is not suitable for long-term occupancy by the governor," the survey said. (Monique Garcia)
