Both fighters would rather be training than talking, and they\u2019ve both watched McGregor\u2019s one-man promotional blitz with a mixture of awe and bewilderment.\n\n\u201cConor is good for the sport,\u201d MacDonald said. \u201cHe\u2019s making us all more money, not just himself. There\u2019s more attention for this pay-per-view, and it\u2019s good for everyone.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Colorado\u2019s own Brandon Thatch born to fight\n\nAfter telling the world all about his invincibility for the past several years, McGregor (17-2) will have several thousand raucous Irish fans in the Las Vegas stands when he ring-walks to a serenade from Sinead O\u2019Connor.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to kill this man across from me,\u201d McGregor said. \u201cHe should have kept his mouth shut. I\u2019m going to slap the face off him. \u2026 His facial structure will be rearranged after the fight.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019ll be locked in a cage with Mendes (17-2), who took the interim title shot on 2 \u00bd weeks\u2019 notice and immediately raised his own trash-talking game.\n\n\u201cYou get all that hype out of here, and I\u2019m going to destroy this dude,\u201d Mendes said. \u201cI\u2019ve been a top-level athlete my entire life. I\u2019ve dealt with guys like this my entire life. I have a game plan, and I\u2019m going to get in there and destroy him.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Michelle Waterson latest Colorado MMA star to reach UFC\n\nBut another title bout looms right before the fireworks.\n\nLawler (25-10) will attempt to maintain his mid-career renaissance with a second victory over MacDonald (18-2), who hopes to claim the belt long held by fellow Canadian Georges St. Pierre.\n\nTheir first bout was a split decision for Lawler, who was positively grateful to have his next fight on a card that didn\u2019t require him to take the promotional lead.\n\n\u201cIt just makes life easier when I concentrate on myself and what I can control,\u201d Lawler said. \u201cAnd what I can control is how hard I\u2019m working, and staying healthy so I can get to that point July 11.\u201d\n\nHere are some more reasons to watch the pay-per-view show that culminates with McGregor\u2019s moment of truth:\n\nSTYLES MAKE FIGHTS: Posturing aside, McGregor\u2019s meeting with Mendes is an intriguing clash in styles. McGregor is a fearsome puncher with unconventional striking tactics. Mendes is an exceptional wrestler who will attempt to keep McGregor on his back, although McGregor insists he will \u201cbutcher you from the bottom.\u201d\n\nREMATCH REDUX?: Lawler won his first bout with MacDonald by landing enough big punches to sway the judges, but MacDonald is a gifted all-around fighter who is likely to keep trying to take down the champion.\n\nDESPERATE TIMES: Featherweight contender Dennis Bermudez had won seven straight bouts until getting choked out by Ricardo Lamas late last year. He needs a win to restart his title contention hopes, but Jeremy Stephens is even more in need of a boost after two straight losses. A meeting of two desperate fighters is always a good thing.\n\nNEW NAMES: While many of the undercard fighters aren\u2019t famous to casual fans, most are top talents eager to progress to the brink of title shots at UFC 189. Gunnar Nelson and Brandon Thatch are still among the top welterweight prospects despite recent losses, while unbeaten flyweight Thomas Almeida will attempt to cement himself as a belt contender against veteran Brad Pickett.\n\nNOTHING EXTRA: Even the preliminary bouts at UFC 189 have something to offer, most notably welterweight brawler Matt Brown taking on the entertaining Tim Means in a clash of two exceptional strikers.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Conor McGregor\u2019s fateful moment highlights deep UFC 189 card", "title": "Conor McGregor\u2019s fateful moment highlights deep UFC 189 card", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/07/11/conor-mcgregors-fateful-moment-highlights-deep-ufc-189-card/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150711_032558_conor-mcgregor.jpg", "height": 467}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150711_032558_conor-mcgregor.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-11T15:28:06+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T06:08:38+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cYou get all that hype out of here, and I\u2019m going to destroy this dude,\u201d Mendes said.\nI\u2019m going to slap the face off him.\nWelterweight champion Robbie Lawler defends his belt against Rory MacDonald in the penultimate bout, a compelling rematch between two tested UFC talents.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to kill this man across from me,\u201d McGregor said.\nBoth fighters would rather be training than talking, and they\u2019ve both watched McGregor\u2019s one-man promotional blitz with a mixture of awe and bewilderment."}
