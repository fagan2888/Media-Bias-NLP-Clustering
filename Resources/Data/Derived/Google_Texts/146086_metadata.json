John Kitzhaber the day after losing her bid to unseat Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley.\n\nAccording to multiple sources, Wehby asked about leading the health agency -- a post that would make her the top state official in charge of implementing Obamacare in Oregon.\n\nMaddow, in the second part of a segment called \"Debunktion Junction,\" had a field day.\n\n\"If there were two things that the Dr. Monica Wehby campaign really wanted you to know about her, \" Maddow said, \"they were, number one, she's a doctor. And, number two, she really doesn't like Obamacare. That's what her whole campaign was about.\"\n\nMaddow ran a clip of a Wehby commercial in which the candidate declared Obamacare \"bad for Oregon\" and \"devastating\" to Oregon families and patients. Maddow also noted, as Gunderson did, that Wehby's campaign slogan was an attack on Obamacare: \"Keep Your Doctor. Change Your Senator.\n\nMaddow gleefully described the irony of an anti-Obamacare candidate changing direction after the election: \"So now she wants to run it! Not busy anymore. Ta-da!\"\n\nIt's worth noting that Wehby denied asking Kitzhaber about a job. Interviewed by Gunderson last week, Wehby said she called the governor to congratulate him and to offer her expertise on health reform.\n\n-- Michelle Brence", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "2014 elections,monica wehby,rachel maddow,us senate", "title": "Rachel Maddow ridicules Monica Wehby's Obamacare reversal", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Rachel Maddow ridicules Monica Wehby\\u0027s Obamacare reversal\", \"link\": \"http://www.oregonlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/11/rachel_maddow_ridicules_monica.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.oregonlive.com/home/olive-media/width620/img/politics_impact/photo/16378830-standard.png\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"14538708\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-11-19T21:32:03Z\", \"author\": \"Michelle Brence | The Oregonian/OregonLive\", \"tags\": [\"2014 elections\",\"@breaking-news\",\"@elections\",\"@hp-top-stories\",\"@mapes\",\"monica wehby\",\"rachel maddow\",\"us senate\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.oregonlive.com/politics_impact/photo/16378830-thumb_square_large.png", "creator": "@mbrence", "site": "@oregonlive", "card": "summary", "description": "The talk show host, citing a story in The Oregonian, slams the former Senate candidate for attacking Obamacare during the campaign then, after losing, seeking a job to help implement it."}, "article_date_updated": "Wednesday, November 19, 2014,  1:32 PM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.oregonlive.com/politics_impact/photo/rachelmaddowpng-8c5bc15b12415282.png\", \"author_name\": \"mbrence\", \"author_nickname\": \"Michelle Brence | The Oregonian/OregonLive\", \"author_id\": \"941\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Politics & Elections\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.oregonlive.com/politics/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "OregonLive.com", "description": "The talk show host, citing a story in The Oregonian, slams the former Senate candidate for attacking Obamacare during the campaign then, after losing, seeking a job to help implement it.", "title": "Rachel Maddow ridicules Monica Wehby's Obamacare reversal", "url": "http://www.oregonlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/11/rachel_maddow_ridicules_monica.html", "image": "http://media.oregonlive.com/design/alpha/img/logo_olive.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "OregonLive.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Wednesday, November 19, 2014,  1:31 PM", "article_author": "Michelle Brence | The Oregonian/OregonLive", "Description": "The talk show host, citing a story in The Oregonian, slams the former Senate candidate for attacking Obamacare during the campaign then, after losing, seeking a job to help implement it."}, "article_summary": "\"The Rachel Maddow Show,\" citing a story by The Oregonian's Laura Gunderson, ran a segment Tuesday on Monica Wehby's interest in running the Oregon Health Authority.\nMaddow also noted, as Gunderson did, that Wehby's campaign slogan was an attack on Obamacare: \"Keep Your Doctor.\n\"If there were two things that the Dr. Monica Wehby campaign really wanted you to know about her, \" Maddow said, \"they were, number one, she's a doctor.\nMaddow ran a clip of a Wehby commercial in which the candidate declared Obamacare \"bad for Oregon\" and \"devastating\" to Oregon families and patients.\nInterviewed by Gunderson last week, Wehby said she called the governor to congratulate him and to offer her expertise on health reform."}
