The first of those added briefs are to be filed April 12. All such filings must be completed by April 20. The court has not indicated how it will proceed beyond that point.\n\nWE CHECKED THE CONSTITUTION, AND\u2026\n\nIn 1993, when Congress passed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, it was thinking about the constitutional right to the free exercise of religion in America, a right that it thought had been threatened by a Supreme Court decision in 1990 allowing a neutral government regulation to be enforced against some religious practices \u2013 in that case, the use of a particular drug in Indian tribal religious ceremonies (Employment Division v. Smith).\n\nBut Congress did not seek to undo that decision by drafting a constitutional amendment \u2013 the usual way to do away with a constitutional ruling by the courts that Congress finds objectionable. Instead, Congress wrote a sweeping law that definitely favors religious sects when they are confronted by a government regulation or command that they believe, in the perceptions of their faith, to be a sin. That is the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.\n\nThus, when the Supreme Court agreed during its current term to review how that Act applies to the Affordable Care Act\u2019s mandate that employers provide birth-control materials and techniques for women of child-bearing age, it was bound to be drawn deeply into the realm of the civic implications of moral theology. It is never entirely comfortable in that realm, and the seven combined cases known as Zubik v. Burwell have shown that this time, too, the court is not entirely sure of its judicial footing.\n\nIn a strangely worded order issued late last month, the Justices reached out to the lawyers in the case for some help, asking them to react to the court\u2019s own idea of a way to decide whether the ACA mandate, and its implementing regulations, tread too heavily upon the beliefs of religious non-profit hospitals, charities and colleges that oppose contraceptives as a matter of faith.\n\nThe first discussion here of the implications of that order examined what would happen if both sides were to embrace the court\u2019s suggestion. Given the legal reality that the court cannot compel the two sides to endorse its proposal, the question now arises: what if one or both sides say they cannot embrace that idea as a way to resolve the dispute?\n\nIt is not too difficult to imagine that happening, in fact. The court\u2019s plan goes a good way toward assuring the non-profits that they would not be directly involved in the pass-through of contraceptives from a government-regulated source to their employees, but it still would use the same insurance company that writes health plans for a non-profit\u2019s employees. And, while the court\u2019s suggestion would help the government assure women that they could still get access to contraceptives, it does seem to imply some complications for the women and not the easy-to-use method now provided under existing Affordable Care Act regulations.\n\nLawyers for either or both sides could wind up, next Tuesday, telling the court that the proposal is flawed, and that it leaves a live controversy between them. Or they could suggest ways to modify it and imply that those would be necessary for them to go along. What then?\n\nThe court would still have before it the same combined seven cases, and the same reality that lower courts are split on it and thus need guidance, and the core issue would still be the same: Do the existing ACA regulations violate RFRA?\n\nFirst possible scenario: the court, loosely speaking, might take the view that, \u201cWell, we tried,\u201d and set forth on drafting a ruling that declares that the government cannot enforce the ACA contraceptives mandate without new regulations, and that the non-profit institutions cannot bar the government from doing the best it can to insulate them from involvement. The government wins on that scenario, but it has to put everything off until it has new rules.\n\nSecond possible scenario: the court, again implying that, \u201cWell, we tried,\u201d could work on a ruling that says the government has done all that it could to accommodate the non-profits\u2019 faith objections, and it just wasn\u2019t enough. The non-profits win on that scenario, and the case is over, forcing the government to rethink its existing rules.\n\nThird possible scenario: the court, feeling that the idea of floating a potential compromise remained a good idea, could appoint a \u201cspecial master\u201d to review possible variations on the court\u2019s idea, and then submit potential recommendations for a ruling.\n\nFourth possible scenario: the court goes back to the opinion-writing process, a bit frustrated, and once more confronts the possibility that four Justices are strongly inclined to be on one side in answering the core question, and four others feel just as strongly on the other side. If such a deadlock can\u2019t be broken by some compromise, then a four-to-four split would end these cases, settling nothing definitively and awaiting the arrival of a ninth Justice to replace the late Antonin Scalia, and the appeal of a new case on the same issue. There are plenty from which to choose a new test of RFRA and the ACA mandate.\n\nFifth possible scenario: the court decides to put the case on hold until sometime in its next term, starting next October, in hopes that, by then, the Senate will have approved a successor to Justice Scalia.\n\nNow, what is not likely to follow a rejection of the court\u2019s idea by the two sides? First: the court does nothing at all, just letting the controversy sit unresolved, deciding it makes no sense in the current atmosphere to try to decide it. Second, the court dismisses the case as one that should never have been granted in the first place. Third, it tells the lawyers to come up with alternatives, and they don\u2019t come back until they have one they can mutually accept. And, fourth, it finds that RFRA is unconstitutional because it goes too far to require the government to accommodate religion (the court actually has been asked to do that very thing, and has not yet been tempted).\n\nAll of this, one way or another, starts next Tuesday, when the lawyers\u2019 replies to the court\u2019s idea are due.\n\nRecent Stories on Constitution Daily\n\nConstitution Check: What does \u201cone-person, one-vote\u201d mean now?\n\nPodcast: Does the Senate have a duty to hold hearings for Supreme Court nominees?\n\nWhat would the Senate look like in 2016 without the 17th Amendment?\n\nShare:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Constitution Daily", "description": "In the second of a two-part series, Lyle Denniston, the National Constitution Center\u2019s constitutional literacy adviser, looks at what happens if one or both sides won\u2019t embrace the Supreme Court\u2019s ...", "title": "Constitution Check: If the Supreme Court\u2019s birth-control idea is rejected, what then?", "url": "http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/2016/04/constitution-check-if-the-supreme-courts-birth-control-idea-is-rejected-what-then/", "image": "http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Supreme_Court_steps_twitter.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Supreme_Court_steps_twitter.jpg?w=640"}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "fb": {"admins": 59543893235, "page_id": 59543893235, "app_id": 108483985888821}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-04-08T10:59:39+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-08T11:02:39+00:00", "author": "http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/author/lyle-denniston/"}, "msvalidate.01": "7A707BA806870C4CB077BE8CFB94D00F", "google-site-verification": "g-YRZSJfme1Aa6j71jlmtj3ZRUHZKtKda1U7n-deAIA", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "All of this, one way or another, starts next Tuesday, when the lawyers\u2019 replies to the court\u2019s idea are due.\nPodcast: Does the Senate have a duty to hold hearings for Supreme Court nominees?\nNow, what is not likely to follow a rejection of the court\u2019s idea by the two sides?\nThird possible scenario: the court, feeling that the idea of floating a potential compromise remained a good idea, could appoint a \u201cspecial master\u201d to review possible variations on the court\u2019s idea, and then submit potential recommendations for a ruling.\nShare:EmailIn the second of a two-part series, Lyle Denniston, the National Constitution Center\u2019s constitutional literacy adviser, looks at what happens if one or both sides won\u2019t embrace the Supreme Court\u2019s novel idea in the Obamacare case."}
