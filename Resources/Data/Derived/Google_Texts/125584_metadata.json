Jones, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Editor's Picks, Glenn Beck, Harry Belafonte, Income inequality, March on Washington, Poverty, President Obama, News, Politics News\n\nWhen Nelson Mandela died last month, I envied South Africans who had worked alongside him for freedom: Americans haven\u2019t gotten to see many of our icons of justice get that old. My immediate thought was of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., assassinated at 39, though Bobby and John Kennedy, Malcolm X and Medgar Evers, quickly followed.\n\nBut the inescapable image was King. Even if the freedom struggle of the 1960s didn\u2019t end up letting King grow old like Mandela, let alone lead his country as president, it was hard not to compare the two, especially since Mandela so often declared his debt to his younger American ally.\n\nKing and Mandela had much in common, but one thing stands out this week: As they were lionized globally, both were deradicalized, pasteurized and homogenized, made safe for mass consumption. Each was in favor of a radical redistribution of global wealth. Each crusaded against poverty and inequality and war. Both did it with an equanimity and ebullience and capacity to forgive and love their enemies that made it easy to canonize them in a secular way. White people love being given the benefit of the doubt and/or being forgiven. I speak from experience.\n\nBut now, as the country turns again to issues of income inequality and poverty, and economic populism is said to be having a \u201cmoment,\u201d maybe it\u2019s time to remember Dr. King, the radical. The one who died trying to ignite a Poor People\u2019s Movement that he saw as the natural outcome of the civil rights movement. The one who tried to branch out to fight poverty and war, but at least in his lifetime \u2013 and so far in ours \u2013 didn\u2019t succeed.\n\n* * *\n\nI loved pretty much everything about the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington last year, except how the right got it so wrong. It seemed to be the beginning of a movement to reclaim the real MLK, especially among liberals. King was of course celebrated hugely, but so were lefty heroes who never get enough credit, like Bayard Rustin and A. Philip Randolph. There were stories about \u201cThe Socialists Behind the March on Washington,\u201d as well as about the media\u2019s and the Kennedy administration\u2019s wrongheaded fears of violence.\n\nComing off of that gorgeous 50th anniversary celebration, though, where we remembered the triumph of King the strategist and organizer, let\u2019s remember the King who tried and, by common measures, failed. Wasn\u2019t feted, wasn\u2019t lionized. King was always a radical, but at the end of his life, he was something of an outcast, criticized by liberals, the left and the right.\n\nForget about the right, for now: King crossed some Democrats and labor leaders when he turned against the Vietnam War in 1967, after his unparalleled Riverside Church speech. He knew the war was not only wrong, but was making Johnson\u2019s alleged \u201cWar on Poverty\u201d fiscally impossible. Meanwhile a growing black power movement mocked King\u2019s commitment to nonviolence and integration. Even some close allies in the civil rights movement blanched when he joined Marion Wright Edelman and other organizers to start a Poor People\u2019s Campaign later that year \u2013 a movement of black, white, Latino, American Indian and Asian people mired in poverty, to fight the war and get the help they deserved. They were to march on Washington and set up a camp there in April 1968, the month King was assassinated.\n\nHarry Belafonte tells a story in his amazing memoir, \u201cMy Song,\u201d about King being challenged by his SCLC deputies on his accelerating radicalism generally, and the Poor People\u2019s Campaign specifically, just a week before he died. Describing King as a \u201csocialist and revolutionary thinker,\u201d Belafonte says he clashed with close ally and future Atlanta mayor and U.N. ambassador Andrew Young, over not only the Poor People\u2019s Campaign, but King\u2019s thoroughgoing critique of capitalism. Belafonte quotes King telling the group, gathered at the singer/actor/activist\u2019s New York apartment: \u201cWhat deeply troubles me now is that for all the steps we\u2019ve taken toward integration, I\u2019ve come to believe that we are integrating into a burning house.\u201d\n\nWhen Belafonte asks what that means they should do, an exhausted King tells him: \u201cI guess we\u2019re just going to have to become firemen.\u201d\n\nAssassinated a week later, King wouldn\u2019t get to lead the Poor People\u2019s Campaign. But almost 50 years later, most of us who think the way he did are still firemen in a burning house, constantly fighting the fires set by radical Republicans to make life worse for the people King cared most about, never getting around to building the sturdy, welcoming, capacious, fire-resistant dwelling that lives in our political imagination. King would be proud of our accomplishments, and also a little bit sad for us. Or maybe I\u2019m just projecting.\n\n* * *\n\nSome of King\u2019s closest living allies have been trying hard to right the reverend\u2019s record. \u201cThere have been and continue to be efforts to \u2018neuter\u2019 or \u2018de-radicalize\u2019 the Dr. King who delivered his \u2018I Have a Dream\u2019 speech in August, 1963,\u201d says his longtime lawyer and speechwriter Clarence B. Jones. Though the dream speech, which Jones helped write, was itself radical, he sees King\u2019s April 1967 \u201cBeyond Vietnam: Time to Break the Silence\u201d speech at Riverside Church as \u201cthe ideological turning point for King.\u201d\n\nHarry Belafonte likewise thinks much of American political culture \u201cis guilty of dealing with Dr. King\u2019s life and story in grievously superficial ways. What gave us all strength to do what we did was his radical thinking.\u201d Acknowledging that King\u2019s turn against the war and toward cross-racial, anti-poverty organizing was \u201ccontroversial\u201d among his closest colleagues, Belafonte notes: \u201cIt was controversial, but controversy wasn\u2019t something he shunned; controversy became the system through which disagreement and debate could be heard. He was comfortable with that. He welcomed it. That aspect of his history is never really discussed.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As the nation rediscovers poverty, it\u2019s time to replace the safe, airbrushed icon with the revolutionary he was", "title": "The radical MLK we need today", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "As the nation rediscovers poverty, it\u2019s time to replace the safe, airbrushed icon with the revolutionary he was", "title": "The radical MLK we need today", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/01/20/the_radical_mlk_we_need_today/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/martin_luther_king2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "As the nation rediscovers poverty, it\u2019s time to replace the safe, airbrushed icon with the revolutionary he was", "title": "The radical MLK we need today", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/martin_luther_king2.jpg", "creator": "@joanwalsh", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Joan Walsh", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Andrew Young, Clarence B.
