His recently released MIT e-mail archive, however, shows that he was indeed one of the prime architects of the Affordable Care Act (ACA).\n\nThe 20,000 pages\u2019 worth of e-mails Gruber sent between January 2009 and March 2010, the period in which the ACA was being drafted, \u201cshow frequent consultations between Mr. Gruber and top Obama administration staffers and advisers in the White House and the Department of Health and Human Services [HHS] on the Affordable Care Act,\u201d according to the Wall Street Journal, which obtained the e-mails from the House Oversight Committee, which in turn obtained them from MIT. \u201cThey show he informed HHS about interviews with reporters and discussions with lawmakers, and he consulted with HHS about how to publicly describe his role.\u201d\n\nThe e-mails also confirm that Gruber met President Barack Obama on at least one occasion and that he was considered a valuable asset to the administration in its push for the ACA.\n\nEven before the brouhaha about Gruber\u2019s remarks, the administration tried to keep his role as an ObamaCare consultant under wraps.\n\nAs Forbes\u2019 Avik Roy reminds us, Gruber was first trotted out by Democrats as an \u201cindependent expert\u201d in the fall of 2009 after PriceWaterhouseCoopers projected that individual insurance premiums would rise sharply under ObamaCare. This, of course, conflicted with the administration\u2019s assertions that the bill would significantly reduce said premiums, and so Gruber was called upon to testify in the Senate and be interviewed by the Washington Post\u2019s Ezra Klein. In that interview, which was also the subject of some of the newly released e-mails, Gruber said, \u201cWhat we know for sure the bill will do is that it will lower the cost of buying non-group health insurance.\u201d\n\nRecalls Roy:\n\nGruber was no independent expert. The Obama administration paid him nearly $400,000 as a consultant on Obamacare\u2019s design, especially its new layer of federal health insurance regulation. But Gruber tried to avoid disclosing this conflict in his public commentary and appearances. Democratic officials did as well, in order to maintain the pose that Gruber\u2019s opinions were non-partisan. Indeed, when Sen. Mike Enzi (R., Wyo.) specifically asked the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for a list of all its paid consultants, Gruber\u2019s name was mysteriously omitted.\n\nThen came the videos. In their wake, Gruber himself denied being \u201cthe architect\u201d of ObamaCare. Democrats rushed to distance themselves from him, too. Representative Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), speaker of the House when the ACA was passed (\u201cso you can find out what is in it\u201d), told reporters, \u201cI don\u2019t know who he [Gruber] is,\u201d and declared in a blog post that \u201cGruber played no role in drafting the Affordable Care Act\u201d and only \u201ctestified at one Senate hearing.\u201d President Obama dismissed Gruber as \u201csome adviser who never worked on our staff.\u201d\n\nAs FactCheck.org points out, Gruber, in fact, made three appearances in the Senate. In addition, \u201cWe found seven instances of Gruber being cited on Pelosi\u2019s leadership website, and the Washington Post dug up November 2009 comments by Pelosi, in which she specifically named Gruber in citing his work.\u201d\n\nAnd while it is true that Gruber was a consultant, not an administration staffer, as the e-mails and other evidence demonstrate, he was hardly an outsider.\n\nA February 2009 e-mail to Gruber from Ezekiel Emmanuel, special advisor for health policy at the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB), said, \u201cI understand \u2026 there is going to be a contract with you that will allow us to work with you \u2018guilt-free.\u2019\u201d\n\nQueried by a Politico reporter in January 2010 about his writing articles about healthcare without disclosing his federal consulting work, Gruber e-mailed top administration health advisor Jeanne Lambrew: \u201cHere is my proposed response \u2014 can you please let me know if you see a problem with this[?]\u201d\n\nAnother e-mail to Lambrew that same day asked her to hold off on sending something. \u201cWant to check with WH [White House] friends,\u201d Gruber wrote, suggesting he was well-connected at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.\n\nGruber\u2019s friends in the administration also apprised him of details that were supposed to be kept hush-hush. In 2009, Lambrew e-mailed Gruber \u201ca set of specs plus the CBO estimate \u2014 totally close hold, the committee did not give me permission to share.\u201d Another Lambrew e-mail reminded him that if he were asked where he got his information, \u201cremember that you didn\u2019t get any CBO estimates from me.\u201d A 2010 e-mail from Obama\u2019s economic advisor Jason Furman informed Gruber, \u201cWe got a deal with labor. Keep that very close hold.\u201d\n\nOther e-mails from Gruber provided administration figures with pro-ACA talking points, including his estimates of winners and \u201closers\u201d from ObamaCare.\n\nA July 19, 2009 e-mail from Gruber to Lambrew stated that then-OMB director Peter Orszag \u201cjust invited me to meet with the head honcho to talk about cost control at 11.\u201d White House visitor logs confirm that Gruber met with Obama the next day \u2014 one of 21 visits the economist made to the White House between 2009 and 2014.\n\nIn case any doubt remains as to Gruber\u2019s central role in foisting ObamaCare on America, consider two more 2009 e-mails from Lambrew. In one, she thanked Gruber \u201cfor being an integral part of getting us to this historic moment.\u201d In the other, she called him \u201cour hero.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis proximity to HHS and the White House was a whole lot tighter than they admitted,\u201d Representative Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), chairman of the House Oversight Committee, told the Journal. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt he was a much more integral part of this than they\u2019ve said. He put up this facade he was an arm\u2019s length away. It was a farce.\u201d\n\nGruber\u2019s status as an architect of ObamaCare is particularly significant in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s impending decision in King v. Burwell, which challenges subsidies for insurance bought on the federal exchange because the ACA specifically states that such assistance is available only to those enrolled through state exchanges. In another of the videos Gruber and the Obama administration wish had never been captured, Gruber says:\n\nWhat\u2019s important to remember politically about [ObamaCare] is if you\u2019re a state and you don\u2019t set up an exchange, that means your citizens don\u2019t get their tax credits \u2014 but your citizens still pay the taxes that support this bill. So you\u2019re essentially saying to your citizens, \u201cYou\u2019re going to pay all the taxes to help all the other states in the country.\u201d I hope that that\u2019s a blatant enough political reality that states will get their act together and realize there are billions of dollars at stake here in setting up these exchanges.\n\nIf one of the people largely responsible for the ACA says subsidies should be available only on state exchanges, one would think that ought to be good enough for the Supreme Court. And given what we now know, there\u2019s no way around it: Jonathan Gruber was an architect of ObamaCare.\n\nPhoto of Jonathan Gruber: AP Images", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "e-mails, Jonathan Gruber, ObamaCare", "og": {"url": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/health-care/item/21130-e-mails-prove-jonathan-gruber-was-prime-architect-of-obamacare", "image": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/media/k2/items/cache/d4c6065eb3bdd4dcbe2698aa94c7561d_XL.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Despite his denials, recently released e-mails show MIT economist Jonathan Gruber played a central role in the drafting and passing of ObamaCare. by Michael Tennant", "title": "E-mails Prove Jonathan Gruber Was Prime Architect of ObamaCare"}, "image": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/media/k2/items/cache/d4c6065eb3bdd4dcbe2698aa94c7561d_XL.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8a3f\"", "article_summary": "And given what we now know, there\u2019s no way around it: Jonathan Gruber was an architect of ObamaCare.\nIn case any doubt remains as to Gruber\u2019s central role in foisting ObamaCare on America, consider two more 2009 e-mails from Lambrew.\n\u201cWant to check with WH [White House] friends,\u201d Gruber wrote, suggesting he was well-connected at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.\nKeep that very close hold.\u201dOther e-mails from Gruber provided administration figures with pro-ACA talking points, including his estimates of winners and \u201closers\u201d from ObamaCare.\nThe Obama administration paid him nearly $400,000 as a consultant on Obamacare\u2019s design, especially its new layer of federal health insurance regulation."}
