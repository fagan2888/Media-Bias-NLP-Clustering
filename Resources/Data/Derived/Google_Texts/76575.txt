Thanksgiving is a time for family, feasting and food comas -- that's a fact. But it's also time for funny tweets. If you can't use Twitter as therapy for when your mom serves a blackened turkey, what is it really good for?

That's why we couldn't help but comb through some of our favorite celebs' Twitter feeds. Kevin Roose entertained us with a beautiful picture of his "bae" (canned cranberry sauce, of course), Jimmy Fallon gave thanks for alcohol (we're with ya, Jimmy) and Megan Amram showed us the sexiest "thigh gap" ever.

Scroll to see who had the best turkey tweets and -- as always-- Bon appeTWEET!
