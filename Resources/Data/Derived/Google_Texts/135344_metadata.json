So what good is it to have Obamacare? I think they should just squash it, and come up with something different,\" he said.\n\nFor many uninsured Floridians, the federal government\u2019s online marketplace offers an opportunity to obtain health insurance\u2014the cost of which will be heavily subsidized. But glitches in the site have made signing up a challenge, and an increasing number of people are turning to local resources for help. As Dees, who lives in the Lafayette County town of Mayo points out, that help is proving hard to find.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re just kinda in the dark there, because, from what I understand, that\u2019s where you have to go to get your price for insurance.\u201d\n\nThe lack of information, especially in the more rural portions of North Florida, does not surprise Elvira Akinyemi, one of a handful of people in the region who have received federal grants to assist people in the signup process.\n\nAkinyemi is the leader of the three-person navigator team based in the Gadsden County town of Quincy, northwest of Tallahassee. The team faces resource problems. There are only a few North Florida navigators for the eight county region they cover. And the federal government\u2019s grant only covers pays for salaries and work-related materials like laptops and travel expenses. There\u2019s no budget for advertising to alert people how to find the navigators.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just running it with the resources we have and that\u2019s why we\u2019re looking to the community for any help if possible,\" Akinyemi said.\n\nShe and her two navigators have formed relationships with churches and towns in the rural Panhandle. But it\u2019s not the rural areas that are the problem \u2013 it\u2019s Tallahassee\"\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s probably two fold- they see it as a political issue and a lot of people don\u2019t want to be involved. And there are still glitches in the system, and maybe they\u2019re concerned about the reputation or if it doesn\u2019t go as smoothly as they hoped.\u201d\n\nIn Tallahassee, the Bond Community Health Center\u2019s certified application counselors are assisting with signups. They\u2019re similar to navigators, but operate out of the community health center\u2014that\u2019s not to be confused with ones run by the state where navigators are banned.\n\n\u201cIf someone were to walk in right now, we\u2019d take them,\" said Bond Outreach Coordinator Sheila Brown, one of the four cetified application counselors at the center. She says her group has fielded many inquiries:\n\n\u201cOur job is to assist you and make sure you get signed up, receive all the information you need. If you have a question we can dial the 1-800 number [to healthcare.gov] for you, but we can\u2019t tell you how to choose a plan, why or why not to choose a plan, that\u2019s not our goal.\u201d\n\nBut what the counselors don\u2019t do at Bond is venture very far from their building. And that\u2019s creating a gap in the system where other groups are stepping in to do \u201coutreach\u201d. Take the WellU Academy: it\u2019s a group of local businesses and doctors headed by the Rogers, Gunter, Vaughn Insurance Agency, where Bart Gunter is the Vice President:\n\n\u201cThe saddest part is, that the people who need it the most, they\u2019re not getting the message and that\u2019s why, as WellU, we want to move out to people, go where they are, go where they\u2019re gathering,\" he said.\n\nUnlike the certified application counselors and the navigators, insurance agents can make recommendations for purchases. They also get commissions on sales. Gunter admits the network of available assistance for uninsured people looking for answers is patchwork at best.\n\nMany different community groups have received federal support to help people buy insurance through the federal government\u2019s exchange website. There are at least two more navigators in the region, but whether they\u2019re actually signing people up is unclear. None of those groups is coordinating efforts with the others. In addition, many of the local contacts listed on the healthcare.gov website are wrong. As a result, Akinyemi feels her region is getting left behind:\n\n\u201cI think honestly, the panhandle is getting lost, because it\u2019s just rural, and we don\u2019t have all the resources.\u201d\n\nFor more news updates, follow Lynn Hatter on twitter @HatterLynn", "article_metadata": {"category": "State News", "description": "Michael Dees is not impressed with what he\u2019s seen or heard so far about the federal government\u2019s health insurance exchanges: \u201cI don\u2019t think you can see", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://news.wfsu.org/post/healthcaregov-navigators-hard-find-north-florida", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wfsu/files/styles/medium/public/201311/NavigatorMap1.jpg.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Michael Dees is not impressed with what he\u2019s seen or heard so far about the federal government\u2019s health insurance exchanges: \u201cI don\u2019t think you can see", "title": "Healthcare.gov Navigators Hard To Find In North Florida"}, "story_id": 242421405, "twitter": {"site": "@wfsunews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@HatterLynn"}, "author": "Lynn Hatter", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Healthcare.gov Navigators Hard To Find In North Florida"}, "nid": 41256, "datePublished": "2013-11-01", "wordCount": 842, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Unlike the certified application counselors and the navigators, insurance agents can make recommendations for purchases.\nThere are only a few North Florida navigators for the eight county region they cover.\nAs Dees, who lives in the Lafayette County town of Mayo points out, that help is proving hard to find.\nThey\u2019re similar to navigators, but operate out of the community health center\u2014that\u2019s not to be confused with ones run by the state where navigators are banned.\nThere are at least two more navigators in the region, but whether they\u2019re actually signing people up is unclear."}
