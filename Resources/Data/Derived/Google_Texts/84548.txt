CNN’s Wolf Blitzer jumped into the Obamacare debate when he suggested that the White House should have considered delaying the rollout of health care exchanges.

After a segment where CNN reporter Brian Todd reported that the administration had been warned months ago about glitches that are plaguing the health care websites, Blitzer commented, “They had three years to get this ready. If they weren’t fully ready, they should accept the advice Republicans are giving them, delay it for a year, get it ready and make sure it works.”

Republicans pounced on the remarks. Texas Congressman Steve Stockman and Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus tweeted their agreement. Blitzer clarified his remarks in a tweet, saying his comments were limited to launching the websites before they worked, not his views on the law itself.
