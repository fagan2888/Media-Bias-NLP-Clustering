It turns that one of her partners, Dr. Marilyn Jerome, is the wife of Democratic congressional candidate John Foust, who has been attacking his opponent, Barbara Comstock, for opposing the expansion of Medicaid in Virginia. He\u2019s been citing his wife\u2019s medical practice to bolster his credentials as a white knight in the war against the Republican \u201cwar on women.\u201d\n\nSo this Washington Free Beacon story is interesting on a couple of levels. Mr. Foust has been touting his wife\u2019s profession and her support of Obamacare.\n\nDr. Jerome claims that her husband is a better candidate because he will never get between a woman and her doctor. \u201cAs an OBGYN,\u201d Foust attacks his Republican opponent Barbara Comstock for opposing Medicaid expansion. Failure to expand Medicaid to rural hospitals could be \u201cdevastating,\u201d he says.
