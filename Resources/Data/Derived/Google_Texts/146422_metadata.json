Residents don't have to be Premera members to enter.\n\n\"Going to your doctor for appropriate screenings is one of the most important things people can do to stay healthy and one of the primary benefits of having a health plan,\" said Ted Conklin, MD, Premera's vice president of medical services. \"This campaign is distinctive because we are not only promoting the importance of using your preventive benefits, we are offering an incentive as well.\"\n\nThe Checkup Challenge campaign was created to shed light on an important aspect of staying healthy\u2014preventive care. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, chronic diseases, including diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol, are responsible for 7 in 10 deaths each year in the United States. Additionally, treating people with chronic diseases accounts for 86 percent of our nation's healthcare costs. Regular checkups include screenings and exams that can save lives and money through early detection of these chronic diseases and other potential health risks.\n\n\"Early identification of risk factors and diagnosis of common health conditions can save or extend lives,\" Conklin said. \"We want to encourage people to take advantage of the preventive care benefits available in maintaining good health for you and your family.\"\n\nMany health plans cover recommended checkups and preventive screenings at little or no cost. Individuals with Affordable Care Act (ACA) metallic plans have the most comprehensive set of preventive benefits at no cost. If a plan is grandfathered (meaning it was in effect before federal healthcare reform was passed in 2010), a more limited range of preventive benefits are included in the plan's coverage. Washington and Alaska residents who have a health plan are encouraged to contact their health plan's customer service department or go online to determine their specific benefits and cost. If you get your plan through your employer, your preventive benefits may be different.\n\nFor more information on Premera's Checkup Challenge, visit checkupchallenge.com for details, official rules and eligibility.
