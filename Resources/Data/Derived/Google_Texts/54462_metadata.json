And the result is it spends about twice as much on health care as some other countries for very little extra benefit in terms of the outcome.\u201d\n\nKlein quoted from a section of Singer\u2019s 1993 treatise \u201cPractical Ethics,\u201d titled \u201cTaking Life: Humans.\u201d\n\nIn the section, Singer argued for the morality of \u201cnon-voluntary euthanasia\u201d for human beings not capable of understanding the choice between life and death, including \u201cseverely disabled infants, and people who through accident, illness, or old age have permanently lost the capacity to understand the issue involved.\u201d\n\nAsked whether he envisions denying treatment to disabled infants to become more common in the U.S. under the new health-care law, Singer replied: \u201cIt does happen. Not necessarily because of costs.\u201d\n\nHe continued (via WND):\n\nIf an infant is born with a massive hemorrhage in the brain that means it will be so severely disabled that if the infant lives it will never even be able to recognize its mother, it won\u2019t be able to interact with any other human being, it will just lie there in the bed and you could feed it but that\u2019s all that will happen, doctors will turn off the respirator that is keeping that infant alive. I don\u2019t know whether they are influenced by reducing costs. Probably they are just influenced by the fact that this will be a terrible burden for the parents to look after, and there will be no quality of life for the child. So we are already taking steps that quite knowingly and intentionally are ending the lives of severely disabled infants. And I think we ought to be more open in recognizing that this happens.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"url": "http://www.theglobaldispatch.com/princetons-peter-singer-argues-its-reasonable-to-deny-care-for-disabled-babies-97389/", "image": "http://www.theglobaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Baby-duct-tape-holding-pacifier-in-mouth.png", "type": "website", "title": "Princeton\u2019s Peter Singer argues it\u2019s \u2018reasonable\u2019 to deny care for disabled babies"}, "google-translate-customization": "7236b401605984b1-3bcbee0db8307092-g6f41da462829b1d2-19", "msvalidate.01": "F9A11A184D618AB8623122584A1DAB2D", "keywords": "Christian News, Religion News, 2016 Election, Outbreak News, Weird News, Movie News, US News, Breaking News, Internet News, Google News", "google-site-verification": "iI9n62s9s0Z-wJUY9p3-wGZp6AQYcH-Z1tDba2QiaT0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdee88\"", "article_summary": "In a radio interview Sunday, Princeton University ethics professor Peter Singer submitted that it is \u201creasonable\u201d for the government or private insurance companies to deny treatment to severely disabled babies.\nSo we are already taking steps that quite knowingly and intentionally are ending the lives of severely disabled infants.\n\u201cIt\u2019s different in the U.S. system, in a way, because it doesn\u2019t do this overtly; maybe it doesn\u2019t do it as much.\nAnd I think we ought to be more open in recognizing that this happens.\nI don\u2019t know whether they are influenced by reducing costs."}
