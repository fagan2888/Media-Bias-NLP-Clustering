They can\u2019t be outmaneuvered by Clinton\u2019s pouring of concrete on them!\n\nThe vulnerabilities of Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton and determined underdog Bernie Sanders are apparent from public opinion polls. But Clinton is the higher priority focus.\n\nIn a fairly recent Gallup poll, voters described Clinton, as a \u201cliar\u201d (voters say she is \u201cdishonest,\u201d they \u201cdon\u2019t trust her\u201d and she has \u201cpoor character\u201d). Voters identify Sanders as a \u201csocialist.\u201d\n\n2016 Election Headquarters The latest headlines on the 2016 elections from the biggest name in politics. See Latest Coverage \u2192\n\nBut let\u2019s get real. The liar will defeat the socialist (Clinton triumphs by telling lies and selling lies). Even if the FBI uncovers strong evidence that Clinton committed criminal offenses with her personal email system, how likely is it that Attorney General Loretta Lynch and the Justice Department\u2014controlled by Obama\u2014will pursue those criminal charges?\n\nSo, let\u2019s go with the conventional wisdom that Clinton\u2019s nearly insurmountable delegate lead will make her the Democratic nominee (despite recent impressive primary wins by Sanders). And let\u2019s examine where Republicans should call out Clinton for the harm she would do to the \u201ceveryday Americans\u201d she claims to \u201cchampion.\u201d\n\nThe evidence is in Clinton\u2019s own misleading statements. According to the website On the Issues, described as \u201cnon-partisan and non-profit,\u201d here are some citations, drawn from \u201cnewspapers, speeches, press releases, book excerpts, House and Senate voting records, Congressional bill sponsorships, political affiliations and ratings, and campaign websites from the Internet.\u201d\n\nHere are just some examples:\n\n\u2022 Clinton has insisted that, \u201cI am a progressive who gets things done.\u201d Really? When asked by ABC\u2019s Diane Sawyer what her \u201cmarquee achievement\u201d was, Clinton \u201cchanged the subject and she fumbled over a similar question during a women\u2019s forum in Manhattan last year. \u2018I see my role as secretary [of state]\u2014in fact leadership in general in a democracy\u2014as a relay race. You run the best race you can run, you hand off the baton. Some of what hasn\u2019t been finished may go on to be finished,\u2019 she told [New York Times columnist] Thomas Friedman.\u201d\n\nHuh? Clinton\u2019s clumsy attempts to distract from her lack of accomplishments provide Republican presidential candidates with target-rich opportunities to set the record straight.\n\nAs The Washington Post has reported, even many Clinton supporters have struggled to come up with any significant Clinton achievements.\n\nClinton herself provides little help as she twists herself in knots attempting to defend her defense of ObamaCare. She\u2019s reduced to taking credit as the progenitor of the president\u2019s unpopular health care reform.\n\nShe told Iowans in a campaign rally in January, \u201cIt was called HillaryCare before it was called ObamaCare.\u201d But as The Hill (online) points out, \u201cClinton has had to tread carefully on ObamaCare throughout her campaign: Democrats support the law but are increasingly willing to acknowledge that it doesn't address the rising out-of-pocket costs.\u201d And Republicans looking for a detailed prescription for how to repeal and replace ObamaCare are advised to consult a new book by my friend (and Fox News contributor) Steve Forbes, \u201cReviving America: How Repealing Obamacare, Replacing the Tax Code, and Reforming the Fed will Restore Hope and Prosperity.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Clinton has said, \u201cWhat's true in our daily lives is also true at the highest levels of government. Keeping America safe, strong, and prosperous presents an endless set of choices.\u201d But the damaging choices Clinton has made include her support of President Obama\u2019s increasingly dangerous, disingenuous and deceptive Iran nuclear deal. Her other catastrophic choices as secretary of state range from her lies and failures of judgment about Benghazi and Libya at large to her massive mismanagement of U.S. policies regarding Syria, Russia, ISIS and other slaughterers of innocents, documented in The Huffington Post.\n\n\u2022 Clinton called criticism of her by Republicans as \u201call a political ploy.\u201d Well, it\u2019s not a ploy for Republican presidential candidates to brand Clinton with her own words. As author and Donald Trump supporter Wayne Allyn Root suggested, \u201cDo you remember [Clinton\u2019s] Congressional hearings over the Benghazi disaster? Hillary famously said, \u2018What difference does it make?\u2019 when referring to four dead American heroes. Make her own that brand. \u2018What difference does it make\u2019 should become Hillary\u2019s middle name. Make her run on Benghazi, Obamacare and Obama\u2019s economy, and Hillary will soon find out what difference it all makes.\u201d\n\nThe Republican plan to defeat Hillary Clinton is as simple as ABC: Always Brand Clinton\u2014by quoting her own dishonesty and disinformation.\n\nCommunications consultant Jon Kraushar is at www.jonkraushar.net.
