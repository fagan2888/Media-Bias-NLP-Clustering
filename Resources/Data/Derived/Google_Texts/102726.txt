ATHENS, Ga. (AP) â€” An Atlanta man is charged with disorderly conduct and public intoxication after police say he boarded a tour bus for the rock band Third Eye Blind and got into a fight with the group's manager.

The Athens Banner-Herald reports (bit.ly/1UruYPw) that the dust-up happened early Saturday morning, following Third Eye Blind's concert at the Georgia Theatre in downtown Athens.

An Athens-Clarke County police report said 28-year-old Kevin G. Knoblich told officers he just wanted to tell band members that he enjoyed the show.

The report said Knoblich told officers he was told to leave the tour bus, and a dispute with the band manager then escalated to slaps and punches.

Clarke County Jail records do not list an attorney for Knoblich, who could be reached for comment.
