HIRAM, Maine — A local man is facing a charge of vehicle theft after allegedly stealing a sedan in Jay, according to state police.

Zebbie Thomas, 23, was arrested on Tuesday, according to a state police statement.

The series of events began Monday when a blue Toyota Corolla was reported stolen out of Jay, and troopers uncovered information that Thomas may have been involved, the statement said.

Troopers and an Oxford County sheriff’s deputy went to Thomas’ residence on Tuesday to question him, but he attempted to flee out a second-story window. However, Trooper Adam Fillebrown and his canine Aros confronted him, sending Thomas retreating back into the residence.

Thomas didn’t get far, as the canine found him hiding in a closet, and he confessed to stealing the Toyota, the statement said. The vehicle was found in the woods across from the residence.

In addition, Thomas also admitted to stealing a pickup truck from Jay in May. That vehicle was also recovered.

Thomas was brought to the Oxford County Jail after his arrest.
