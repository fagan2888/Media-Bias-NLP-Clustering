'In God We Trust.'

Four words that drew hundreds from all over the Panhandle to Bonifay Sunday in both support and opposition of the state and national motto being displayed on the city's police cars and fire trucks.

But police Chief Chris Wells says ever since the station started putting on the stickers, the response has been overwhelmingly positive.

"My telephone, text messages, social media has just been off the roof with positive comments commending us for doing this and commending us for taking a stand," said Wells.

But the move prompted Wesley Wilson and others from Bay, Washington, and Holmes counties to take a stand against the stickers, emphasizing what they say is important about the separation of church and state.

"Everyone's going to have different beliefs," said Wilson. "We don't think it's right for the government to try to force any beliefs on anyone. We think people should be able to believe or not believe as they please. And putting 'In God We Trust' on the back of the police cars, that says something about us."

According to Wells, this isn't actually the first time the four word saying has been displayed on Bonifay police cars.

He says the saying has actually been on cars ever since the department started displaying shields on their cars since the 1980s.

But Wells says Sunday marked a day where many came to stand behind a motto deeply rooted in a community.

"United we stand, divided we fall. And our community is united behind this motto. It's united behind 'In God We Trust," said Wells. "Sheriff McKeithen had this idea. I think it's a good idea. It shows what we stand for. Our community's behind it, and that's why we're supporting it."

Wells says the Holmes County Sheriff's Office cars will begin displaying 'In God We Trust' stickers this week, and the county ambulances will begin displaying the stickers next week.
