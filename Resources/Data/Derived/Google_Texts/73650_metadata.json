At r/explainlikeimfive, redditors have been trying to figure out Obamacare for the last six hours. Members are debating both persuasively and germanely, and to be honest, they\u2019re conducting themselves with far more honor than those knuckleheads up on Capitol Hill ever do.\n\nWith all the talk of Obamacare (its at the center of yet another government shutdown debate right now) going on lately, redditor zapeter very boldy and honestly admitted that he doesn\u2019t understand the controversial healthcare overhaul package very well, and would like to hear some opposing viewpoints.\n\nAnywhere else, dangling something like that out there is pretty much a recipe for chaos, but not at reddit. Okay, sometimes at reddit, but not this time.\n\nInstead, several users posted both Conservative and Liberal criticisms (yes, the latter exist) of President Obama\u2019s signature legislation that sound more rational and salient than any you\u2019ve ever heard on on cable news or from politicians on either side of the aisle.\n\nJust check out this Conservative take on Obamacare:\n\nAnd the Progressive/Democrat side:\n\nOf course, both of those viewpoints are open to some scrutiny, and there was some debate.\n\nLook how nice everyone is playing with each other!\n\nSo if you\u2019d like to learn more about Obamacare than the politicians behind or against it in a safe environment free from petty name-calling, faux-intellectual posturing, and party-line pablum, go check out the reddit ELI5 Obamacare thread here.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nPinterest\n\nGoogle\n\nEmail\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Something interesting is happening on reddit right now (no, not Pirate Day).", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Social News Daily", "description": "Something interesting is happening on reddit right now (no, not Pirate Day).", "title": "Reddit Tries To Figure Out Obamacare, Handles Debate Better Than Congress", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 616, "identifier": "http://socialnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/reddit-alien-616x359.png", "height": 359}, "updated_time": "2014-03-23T08:56:56-04:00", "url": "http://socialnewsdaily.com/16842/reddit-tries-figure-obamacare-somehow-handles-debate-better-congress/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Something interesting is happening on reddit right now (no, not Pirate Day).
