A Florida mayor fined for an ethics violation is in more hot water after trying to pay the $4,000 fine with 360,000 pennies and nickels, which violated another rule stipulating he could only pay the fine by check.

Hialeah Mayor Carlos Hernandez is now being sued by the Miami-Dade Commission on Ethics and Public Trust for “non-compliance,” according to the Miami Herald.

The commission has also doubled the original fine, which stemmed from a ruling in July that Hernandez lied about interested rates on a $180,000 loan to Luis Felipe Perez, a jewelry salesman who was jailed in a pyramid scheme.

“On November 6th, the Mayor sent 28 buckets of coins (along with several television crews) in an apparent attempt to pay the fine in disregard of the COE requirement that it be paid by check,” the commission said in a statement, according to the Miami Herald. “His ploy was deemed commercially unreasonable and contemptuous by COE staff, and therefore, rejected.”

Hernandez has called members of the commission “clowns” and criticized the “political circus” the case against him has become.
