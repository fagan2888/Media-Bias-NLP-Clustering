Begich has introduced a bill that makes the change and he\u2019s looking for larger legislation to attach it to. He says he\u2019s confident there\u2019s enough support in Congress to pass it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not reopening the whole debate over Affordable Health Care Act and I think a lot of people recognize that,\u201d Begich said. \u201cAnd as you know there are over 4 million American Indians, Alaska Natives throughout the country so I think there\u2019s a lot of interest to just resolve this and kind of move on.\u201d\n\nBegich says the Obama Administration knows the definition is a problem and they\u2019re highly motivated to get it fixed.\n\nAlaska Natives have until December 2014 to apply for an exemption from the law\u2019s individual mandate. It will be a paper application.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Alaska Public Media", "description": "Thousands of Alaska Natives will miss out on benefits they qualify for under the Affordable Care Act if the definition of Alaska Native under the law isn't changed.
