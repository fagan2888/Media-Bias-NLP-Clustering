Danny Davis explained to constituents why he voted for the Obamacare law by publishing a stretch of dummy text\n\nThe Weekly Standard first reported a few of the anomalies Friday morning. Shortly after MailOnline completed its search, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services began pulling the pages down.\n\nNow users navigating to the previously unfinished pages are met with a message: 'Sorry, we can't find that page on HealthCare.gov.' We've recently reorganized our site, and that may explain it. It's also possible that you mistyped the address.\n\n\n\nGoogle's robust automatic cache recorded copies of the flawed pages, but by noontime those, to, began to disappear.\n\nThe search giant's corporate headquarters did not respond to requests for comment. But a flustered official at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, speaking on condition of anonymity, conceded that the resulting picture didn't look good.\n\nIt's 'something that should never have been left hanging for this long,' said the official, who is not authorized to speak publicly. '[Our] tech teams scrambled mid-morning. What can I say?'\n\nMore problems: As President Barack Obama golfs his way across Martha's Vineyard, he'll be dismayed to learn that Americans who can't understand Latin nonsense words still aren't getting critical information from his health insurance website Infected: Back-end programming code includes the silly text too\n\nVictims' Wrongs Caucus: A bipartisan congressional group is communicating gibberish\n\nAsked what the consequences the agency could see for for leaving Americans in the dark for so long about basic elements of the Affordable Care Act's services, he said it would be handled quietly but did not classify it as a high priority.\n\n'LOREM IPSUM': Dummy text that's supposed to be temporary\n\nFor centuries, typesetters and graphic designers have used Latin-style nonsense words like these to plan their pages long before writers have decided what to communicate. The beginning of the text dates back to at least 45 B.C., but the rest is completely meaningless:\n\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sumenda potius quam expetenda. Ut optime, secundum naturam affectum esse possit.\n\nQuid iudicant sensus? Cum salvum esse flentes sui respondissent, rogavit essentne fusi hostes. Ita nemo beato beatior. Duo Reges: constructio interrete. Quo modo autem philosophus loquitur?\n\nEt si turpitudinem fugimus in statu et motu corporis, quid est cur pulchritudinem non sequamur? Sin tantum modo ad indicia veteris memoriae cognoscenda, curiosorum. Dici enim nihil potest verius. Sint ista Graecorum; In his igitur partibus duabus nihil erat, quod Zeno commutare gestiret.\n\n\n\n'We'll fix it, sure. In our own time ,' he told MailOnline. 'We're really focused on the back-end of the site right now, getting insurers paid and making sure collected premiums are being assigned to the correct accounts.'\n\nTemporarily inserting 'Lorem Ipsum' text \u2013 meaningless but standardized strings of Latin \u2013 into the Obamacare website appears to have been a common practice for code monkeys as well as art directors.\n\nOne lengthy page of javascript language computer code, designed to implement the health insurance registration process, still includes at least 17 separate snippets of 'Lorem ipsum.'\n\nSome state-level Obamacare exchanges also suffer from the same problem. The Get Covered Illinois website includes a page \u2013 full of 'Lorem ipsum' \u2013 intended to help consumers choose their insurance plans.\n\n\n\nCongress, too, has its share of lazy Web coders who have left a trail of the placeholder words in their wake.\n\nRep. Danny Davis, an Illinois Democrat, provides his constituents with an online explanation of the rationale behind his decision to vote in favor of the Affordable Care Act. Its entire contents are 'Lorem ipsum' words.\n\nAnother Democratic lawmaker, Rep. David Price of North Carolina, has published three paragraphs of the text in place of a press release. Staffers of Arizona Democratic Rep. Ed Pastor and California Republican Rep. John Campbell appear to have made the same error.\n\n\n\nThe website of the Congressional Victims' Rights Caucus, a group founded by Texas Republican Rep. Ted Poe and California Democratic Rep. Jim Costa, includes a 2012 press release that consists of nothing but the dummy text.\n\nMilitary veterans, too, are stung by the nonsense copy on Healthcare.gov\n\nCovering their tracks: HHS began pulling down its dummy text-filled pages after reporters starting sniffing Another plagiarized graduate thesis in Congress? No, just nonsense text disguised as a press release\n\nThe Office of General Counsel (OGC) of the House of Representatives, too, features online press releases and one op-ed that are little more than 'Lorem ipsum.\n\nThe OGC is the office that will soon file House Speaker John Boehner's landmark federal lawsuit against President Barack Obama, inspired by the White House's changes to the Obamacare law.\n\nAnd the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n\n\n\nSome savvy Web designers have devised ways to use dummy text without leaving a trail of breadcrumbs in case the fake words remain there longer than intended.\n\nTricks include the use of online custom text generators which provide endless paragraphs of real-looking but nonsensical words based on limited dictionaries tailored to specific interests.\n\nOne assembles text that reads like a page from a Samuel L. Jackson movie. The output from another reads like the stylings of the artist formerly known as Snoop Dogg.\n\n\n\nThere's a text generator for hipster language like ' Vinyl flexitarian pour-over farm-to-table, street art meggings slow-carb put a bird on it scenester chambray shabby chic.'\n\nYet another capitalizes on the popularity of pork bellies.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "news_keywords": "Lorem,ipsum,dolor,sit,amet,Obama,healthcare,website,sports,nonsense,text,nearly,YEAR,troubled,rollout,Congress,problem", "original-source": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2726082/Lorem-ipsum-dolor-sit-amet-Obama-healthcare-website-sports-nonsense-text-nearly-YEAR-troubled-rollout-Congress-problem.html", "doc-class": "Living Document", "twitter": {"description": "Google briefly kept copies of the flawed pages online, but those began mysteriously disappearing midday Friday.
