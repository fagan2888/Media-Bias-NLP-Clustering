A woman who went missing along the Kansas Turnpike in Chase County has been found safe.

The Kansas Highway Patrol says 51-year-old Debra L. Johnston was located Saturday in Chase County and is unharmed.

On Wednesday around 3:30 p.m., a state trooper saw Johnston walking away from a car parked on the turnpike near mile marker 108. She was carrying a red duffel bag and a white bucket.

When the trooper was able to turn around to see if the woman needed assistance, she was gone. Area law enforcement officers organized a search of the area near her abandoned vehicle, about 19 miles south of Emporia.

The Kansas Highway Patrol did not have details of where Johnston had been, only that she had found shelter. KAKE News continues to track this story and we will have more information as soon as it becomes available.
