The Nuggets on Saturday signed forward Wilson Chandler to a multiyear contract extension, general manager and executive vice president of basketball operations Tim Connelly announced.

Terms of the deal were not released, only that his deal had been restructured.

The 6-foot-8, 225-pound Chandler, 28, who has played in the NBA for eight seasons, averaged 13.9 points and 6.1 rebounds in 78 games last season for the Nuggets.

Earlier in the day, sources told the Northeast Ohio Media Group that free-agent shooting guard Will Barton was finalizing a three-year contract worth about $11 million to remain with the Nuggets.

“A sign of things to come! It’s official baby. Let’s do this @denvernuggets,” Barton later wrote in an Instagram post.

Barton, 24, averaged 11.0 points, 4.6 rebounds and 1.9 assists after being acquired in a trade with Portland in February.
