(AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana)\n\nFreedom Partners Chamber of Commerce, the funding arm of the political network backed by the billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch, wants a lot more hard information from the crowded field of presidential contenders before deciding what to do with its considerable resources.\n\nThe group is pressing every 2016 candidate to detail on the record their plans for economic growth, deficit reduction, entitlement reform, criminal justice and even foreign policy.\n\nThe tax-exempt entity, a key node in a constellation of conservative entities that aims to spend $889 million before the next White House election, distributed a detailed survey Thursday to all of the declared and likely presidential candidates. Their four-page list, which was obtained by The Washington Post, asks for responses by July 18.\n\nSign up for The Daily 202, The Washington Post\u2019s new political tipsheet\n\n\u201cThe questions in this survey represent issues prioritized by our members,\u201d according to the introductory text.\n\nThe most striking of the 25 questions focus on the U.S. role in the world. It\u2019s a reflection of how salient foreign policy has become over the past year in conservative circles with the rise of ISIS, including among economic-minded activists.\n\nJames Davis, a spokesman for Freedom Partners, confirmed the authenticity of the document and said the responses will be used to educate both members and the public at-large. He said it was distributed to both Republican and Democratic campaigns.\n\nRead more PowerPost\n\nThough the Koch-network hasn\u2019t embraced a single candidate in the 2016 sweepstakes, it has signaled interest in several Republicans. Answers to the questionnaire could help drive its decision making.\n\nThe Arlington County-based organization, whose board includes current and former Koch Industries officials, has avoided backing any individual 2016 candidate but helped elevate a group of them.\n\nAt a California retreat in January for its other major donors, the secretive group allowed the press to watch a livestream of a panel featuring Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Marco Rubio of Florida. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker also appeared during the weekend but was not on the panel.\n\nThe network strongly opposes the reauthorization of the Export-Import bank, whose charter expires on July 1 without congressional action. Freedom Partners recently praised Cruz, Paul and Rubio, as well as former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, for backing the phase-out of the bank, which provides loans to U.S. companies doing business overseas.\n\nUnder a section on crony capitalism and corporate welfare, the new Freedom Partners questionnaire asks not just about Ex-Im, but also federal agricultural subsidies, the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) and the federal renewable fuel standard, which is big in Iowa but free-market devotees vigorously oppose.\n\nThe brothers care passionately about criminal justice reform and have publicly complained that too many Americans are in jail. So it\u2019s not a surprise that the candidates are asked to weigh in about the war on drugs.\n\nThere are also questions on the big news of this month, including what should be done if the Supreme Court uses King v. Burwell to strike down federal subsidies for health insurance in states without exchanges.\n\nThe questionnaire is silent on social issues, such as gay marriage and abortion, which are important to many Republican primary voters but much less so to Koch network participants.\n\nBut there is a heavy dose of foreign policy inquiries.\n\nFreedom Partners wants the candidates to spell out criteria for deploying U.S. troops, whether the U.S. should intervene in Syria and Ukraine, and how far the president should be willing to go in order to stop Iran from getting a nuclear weapon and whether defense spending can be cut.\n\nAsked about these foreign policy questions, Davis explained: \u201cWe live in a global marketplace and are $18 trillion in debt; now more than ever, our economy, our jobs and opportunities for countless Americans are impacted by U.S. foreign policy decisions.\u201d\n\nHere is the full text of the questionnaire\u2014\n\nSection 1: Expanding Opportunity for Everyone\n\nQuestion #1: What specific policies would your administration pursue to create greater opportunity for all Americans?\n\nQuestion #2: Do you believe too many activities are criminalized in America and, as a result, too many people are incarcerated?
