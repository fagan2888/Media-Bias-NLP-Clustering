Here\u2019s our chance for the loyal opposition to tell America what\u2019s wrong with Obamacare. And what I listened to \u2026 was people saying, \u2018Hey, your web site ain\u2019t working, ha-ha.\u2019\u201d\n\nSeverin said he was struck by how few people spoke about the perils of Obamacare itself, rather than just the website\u2019s flaws.\n\n\u201cImagine we had this hypothetical hearing, and on the stand under oath we have the chief administrative officer in charge of initiating slavery, and the very best objection we could conjure is, \u2018Hey, your sign-up process isn\u2019t working properly. You really screwed that up. This proves it\u2019s time to delay and fix it.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cFix it?\u201d Severin repeated. \u201cFix what? I mean, I believe Abe Lincoln could have summoned an argument of greater moral stature than, \u2018Hey, your slavery arrests are way behind schedule! Let\u2019s fix it. Just imagine if you got it working properly, we could be processing millions of human beings like gangbusters.\u2019\u201d\n\nLincoln probably would\u2019ve said something along the lines of, Severin asserted: \u201cSlavery is wrong. It\u2019s immoral. It\u2019s anti-constitutional, and it\u2019s not in the inefficiencies of how you\u2019re rounding people up, but rather in the immorality of enslaving them! A more effective means of signing them up is \u2013 and can never be \u2013 a rational or a moral measure of the success.\u201d\n\nWhile Beck said he agreed with and was struck by Severin\u2019s analogy, he said he felt the need to press him on how exactly Obamacare is comparable to slavery.\n\nSeverin argued that under Obamacare, \u201cthe government forces us to buy and do things we don\u2019t want, taxes us for it,\u201d and \u201cit will end up murdering people.\u201d\n\nAmong other things, Severin referenced Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel\u2019s advocacy for a way of determining who gets medical care in scarcity situations, which the doctor termed \u201cthe complete lives system.\u201d Rather than each doctor doing all they can for each patient, Emanuel argues that treatment should be based on a number of factors, like the \u201cquality-adjusted life years\u201d the patient has ahead and \u201cpromoting and rewarding social usefulness.\u201d\n\nUnder Ezekiel\u2019s plan, people ages 15-40 years old would get the most treatment, partially because they can contribute the most to society.\n\n\u201cAdolescents have received substantial education and parental care, investments that will be wasted without a complete life,\u201d Ezekiel wrote in a 2009 article. \u201cInfants, by contrast, have not yet received these investments. Similarly, adolescence brings with it a developed personality capable of forming and valuing long-term plans whose fulfilment requires a complete life.\u201d\n\nEzekiel Emanuel served as special advisor for health policy to the director of the White House Office of Management and Budget from 2009 to 2011 and is the brother of President Obama\u2019s former chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel.\n\nSeverin commented: \u201cIn this whole \u2018arc of usefulness,\u2019 once you fall outside the arc of usefulness, then you just become a bottle of spoiled milk. This is the man and this is the philosophy on which the so-called, and very real, \u2018death panels; are based.\u201d\n\nYou can watch video of Severin\u2019s discussion with Beck, below:\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nThe full episode of The Glenn Beck Program, along with many other live streaming shows and thousands of hours of on-demand content, is available on just about any digital device.
