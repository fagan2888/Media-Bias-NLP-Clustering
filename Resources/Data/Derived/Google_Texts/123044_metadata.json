That was to start this month, to get rid of some unpopular Obamacare taxes or mandates even if they can\u2019t scrap the whole law.\n\nBut persistent divisions among Republicans, along with the reelection concerns of some GOP senators in liberal or swing states, are again slowing things down.\n\nThe chairmen of the key Senate committees overseeing Obamacare \u2014 Orrin Hatch of Finance, and Lamar Alexander of Health, Education, Labor and Pensions \u2014 say they haven\u2019t drawn up reconciliation plans, saying doing so is up to leadership.\n\nSen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), a member of the Senate leadership and a point person on health policy, said there\u2019s no rush to do reconciliation immediately \u2014 and that Senate leaders haven\u2019t decided on how to use the fast-track budget tool.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no timeline on the reconciliation bill, so it can be used at any point,\u201d Barrasso said, even though the GOP\u2019s own budget resolution had instructed five health care committees \u2014 two in the Senate and three in the House \u2014 to come up with a repeal plan by July 24.\n\nThose instructions were precisely why many conservatives agreed to vote for the budget in the first place. Reconciliation lets the Senate pass legislation on a simple majority vote, which would eliminate any need to bring Democrats on board, or worry about a filibuster by Obamacare supporters. It would be a one-shot opportunity to get a partial repeal of Obamacare to Obama\u2019s desk \u2014 even if it would almost certainly be vetoed.\n\nDelays might not sit well with House conservatives, who have voted to dismantle Obamacare dozens of times and were eager for the Senate, under Republican control for the first time in Barack Obama\u2019s presidency, to do the same.\n\n\u201cReconciliation instructions should be very narrow and focused exclusively on Obamacare,\u201d said Rep. Bill Flores of Texas, chairman of the conservative Republican Study Committee.\n\n\u201cNo one thinks Obama\u2019s going to sign a repeal of his own bill \u2026 but I\u2019m still for doing it,\u201d said Rep. Alex Mooney (R-W.Va.), another House conservative. \u201cIt\u2019s what I pledged to do in my campaign.\u201d\n\nSenate Republicans are well aware that they\u2019d have some convincing to do on their right flank.\n\n\u201cMy view is there will be some effort here to be sure that members who voted for the budget with the reconciliation capability in the budget feel like it\u2019s used in the way that they expected that to be used,\u201d said Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri, a member of the Republican leadership.\n\nIn the House, conservatives like Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) supported the budget on the condition that it set the stage for Obamacare action.\n\nRepublican lawmakers and staffers say that the July 24 deadline doesn\u2019t really mean anything. The Senate could still pass a reconciliation bill even if none of the committees report legislation, and they have until the end of this session of Congress \u2014 the end of 2016 \u2014 to do so.\n\nBut in the House, an aide to Ways and Means Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said Ryan had planned to report out legislation by the original deadline of July 24. House staff members also said that no decision has been made on what it will cover, but it will likely be Obamacare-related.\n\nThe Senate\u2019s reasons for a potential delay are partly practical. The July schedule is jampacked: Education, cybersecurity and highway bills are all stealing much of the energy. Should negotiators reach an Iran nuclear deal, that would also take a big chunk of time.\n\nIf the Supreme Court had eliminated federal subsidies under Obamacare in two-thirds of the states, the GOP would have moved quickly to use reconciliation to deal with the fallout.\n\n\u201cHad the King decision gone the other way \u2026 there would have been an immediacy to use reconciliation,\u201d Barrasso said. \u201cBut since the decision went the other way, that immediacy isn\u2019t there.\u201d\n\nBut timing is only a sliver of the issue. The caucus is split into several camps on how to approach reconciliation.\n\nConservatives want to try to repeal as much of Obamacare as possible under Senate rules.\n\nMembers up for reelection in 2016, and some Republicans from purple states, are leery of launching a repeal without offering any sort of replacement. They\u2019re reluctant to take away Obamacare subsidies for the lower-income and middle class without providing an alternative path to health coverage.\n\nOther lawmakers are floating the idea of mixing repeal of part of Obamacare, such as the medical device tax, which is loathed by members of both parties, with non-health care items such as broader tax reform. Another idea circulating is to use reconciliation to raise caps on federal spending, a sequel to the deal struck by Ryan and Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) several years ago.\n\n\u201cI would prefer that [spending deal] to a dead-on-arrival repeal of Obamacare,\u201d said Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.). \u201cI think we need to find some way to arrive at something like a Ryan-Murray II, and if that\u2019s one of the mechanisms that gets us there, I\u2019m all for it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "&quot;No deadline,&quot; says John Barrasso, as House conservatives cry foul.", "og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "&quot;No deadline,&quot; says John Barrasso, as House conservatives cry foul.", "title": "Senate downplays Obamacare repeal", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/senate-obamacare-repeal-no-deadline-119872.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/07/08/lede_150708_obamacare_gty_1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "keywords": "Obamacare,John Barrasso,Congress,Barack Obama,Alex Mooney,Senate,Health Care,Republicans,Bill Flores,Reconciliation,Affordable Care Act,Roy Blunt", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/rachael.bade.9"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "July was supposed to be the big month for Obamacare repeal in Congress.\n\u201cI would prefer that [spending deal] to a dead-on-arrival repeal of Obamacare,\u201d said Rep.
