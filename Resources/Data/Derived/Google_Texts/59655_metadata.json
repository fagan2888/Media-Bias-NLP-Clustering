But two bills in Missouri \u2014 one of those nine states \u2014 may reverse that policy with bipartisan support, and eliminate a vicious cycle of crime.\n\nHouse Bill 1589 and Senate Bill 680 will permit \u201c[individuals] who [have] pled guilty to or is found guilty under federal or state law of a felony involving possession or use of a controlled substance\u201d to enter the SNAP program, if they fulfill at least one of several eligibility requirements. For instance, convicts can receive food stamps if they are enrolled in a \u201csubstance abuse treatment program approved by the division of alcohol and drug abuse within the department of mental health,\u201d has completed such a program, or is currently on a waiting list to do so. People can also secure food stamps if four years have transpired since a conviction, or if they have adhered to the \u201cobligations imposed by the court,\u201d including probation terms.\n\nBoth bills, which were sponsored by Rep. Paul Wieland (R) and Shalonn Curls (D) in Missouri\u2019s House of Representatives and Senate, respectively, have the backing of 18 additional state leaders. They also proceeded through committee uncontested.\n\nAccording to the president of Justice Fellowship, Craig DeRoche, the inability to receive food stamps is detrimental to convicts because it often leads to additional crime. Convicts who have no safety net turn to illegal methods of procuring food and other items necessary for their survival. If Bills 1589 and 680 are passed, individuals will be granted access to those goods without resorting to criminal activities, and public safety will be strengthened as convicts alter their behavior to meet the eligibility requirements.\n\nThe proposed legislation in Missouri falls under a larger trend of bipartisan support for criminal justice reform. Drug sentencing is another issue that conservatives have tackled alongside Democrats; last year, Sen/ Rand Paul (R-KY) claimed, \u201cThe injustice of mandatory minimum sentences is impossible to ignore when you hear the stories of the victims.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Several states ban food stamp use among convicts, but Missouri lawmakers are taking steps to change that.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Several states ban food stamp use among convicts, but Missouri lawmakers are taking steps to change that.", "title": "People Convicted Of Drug Crimes In Missouri Can Be Sentenced To Starvation \u2014 Here\u2019s How To Fix That", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2014/03/19/3416224/missouri-food-stamps/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/shutterstock_135865661.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Several states ban food stamp use among convicts, but Missouri lawmakers are taking steps to change that.", "creator": "@CarimahWheat", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/shutterstock_135865661-321x214.jpg", "title": "People Convicted Of Drug Crimes In Missouri Can Be Sentenced To Starvation \u2014 Here\u2019s How To Fix That", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-justice", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/shutterstock_135865661.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/shutterstock_135865661.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-19T16:32:19+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/carimahwritesstuff/"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd3d3\"", "article_summary": "Justice People Convicted Of Drug Crimes In Missouri Can Be Sentenced To Starvation \u2014 Here\u2019s How To Fix That CREDIT: AP ImagesDue to legal restrictions, nine states in the U.S. prevent people convicted of nonviolent drug crimes from receiving Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits.\nPeople can also secure food stamps if four years have transpired since a conviction, or if they have adhered to the \u201cobligations imposed by the court,\u201d including probation terms.\nBut two bills in Missouri \u2014 one of those nine states \u2014 may reverse that policy with bipartisan support, and eliminate a vicious cycle of crime.\nThe proposed legislation in Missouri falls under a larger trend of bipartisan support for criminal justice reform.\nAccording to the president of Justice Fellowship, Craig DeRoche, the inability to receive food stamps is detrimental to convicts because it often leads to additional crime."}
