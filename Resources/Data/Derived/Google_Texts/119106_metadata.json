Joe and Barbie in the National Toy Hall of Fame.\n\nThe tiny plastic soldiers, a nightmare for barefoot parents, beat out nine other finalists for the coveted spot in the museum, including Fisher-Price Little People, American Girl dolls and My Little Pony, the Associated Press reported Thursday.\n\nThe 1980\u2019s puzzle Rubik\u2019s Cube and soap bubbles also made it to the National Toy Hall of Fame on Thursday.\n\nLittle green army men first emerged in 1938 but fell out of favor after the Vietnam War. After the toy was prominently featured in the 1995 Pixar hit \u201cToy Story\u201d the green soldiers came back in vogue.\n\nIt is unclear how many sets of little soldiers have sold over the years. They are still available for purchase online for varying prices. A \u201cBucket O Soldiers\u201d is available for $16.99 and included 72 soldiers and two parachutes.\n\nToys are chosen for inclusion in the hall of fame by a national selection committee made up of 24 experts, including toy collectors, designers and psychologists who select nominees that have achieved icon status over generations, fostered learning, creativity or discovery, and have profoundly changed play or toy design, AP reported.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Little green army men, a favorite toy for generations of pretend soldiers, joined classics like G.I.
