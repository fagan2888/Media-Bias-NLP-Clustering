Abraham Feliz didn’t waste any time in announcing himself to the rest of Hudson County.

The North Bergen guard spent the first 32 minutes of his sophomore season scoring a game-high 24 points and punctuating his team’s 68-43 victory over Ferris yesterday in Jersey City.

Feliz, who played sparingly last season as a freshman, did most of his damage from the foul line, going 15-for-16 from the charity stripe and staying aggressive from the opening tip-off to the final whistle.

“He likes to get to the rim. He’s a more slashing type of guard,” North Bergen coach Kevin Bianco said of Feliz. “It’s definitely important to help his confidence which is why we’re letting him play through his mistakes, so he can keep his confidence.”

Feliz wasn’t the only Bruins player to excel at the foul line, as Bianco’s group went a combined 31-for-35 on foul shots.

But the Bruins all but sealed the victory in the second quarter when they used a 25-2 run to turn an 11-9 game at the end of the opening frame into a blowout by halftime. North Bergen received scoring from eight different players during the second-quarter surge, including five points each from Anthony Rodrigues and Brian Fabre.

“They were playing us zone so we were just moving the ball until we got an open shot,” said Feliz.

Byron Morel paced the home team with a team-high 12 points, including a pair of 3-pointers coming in the first and fourth quarters. After trailing 36-11 at the intermission, the Bulldogs outscored the Bruins 14-12 in the third stanza but could not close the gap even after Brandon Hartwig nailed a 23-foot 3-pointer at the buzzer.

“I thought we played with a lot of energy,” said Bianco, whose team returns to action on Monday against St. Peter’s Prep. “(Ferris) started being more of the aggressor in the second half which got them back in the game a little bit.”

But Feliz kept his foot on the gas pedal, scoring 11 points in the fourth quarter, nine of which came from the foul line.

“Trying to get the win, set the tone for the season, set the pace for my team,” Feliz said. “Stay aggressive and just play my game.

“It was a good confidence boost.”
