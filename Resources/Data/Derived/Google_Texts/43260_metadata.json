BNP itself had previously predicted seven additional rate increases before the end of 2017.\n\nHowever, BNP analysts argue that in hindsight, given low oil prices and a slowing global economy, not only was the December rate hike the wrong call, but that the number of rate hikes expected in the next two years is no longer seven, but also zero.\n\n\u201cOur overall conclusion is that, for a variety of reasons connected with US policy and developments abroad, US policy has tightened prematurely and has reached neutral too rapidly,\u201d analysts wrote. \u201cThis development is not adequately captured by looking at the fed funds rate alone. We believe current policy is consistent with growth in line with the 1.5 percent trend, but no more.\u201d\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s Where Negative Interest Rates Are Coming Next\n\n\u201cThe current boost to consumer demand from lower oil prices is giving a false sense of security on the economy,\u201d they continued. \u201cWe believe a slowdown is coming (though not in Q1 2016) to growth of 1.5 percent in 2017. In light of this, no further tightening of fed funds is warranted this year or next.\u201d\n\nThe Fed, of course, doesn\u2019t take its marching orders from international bankers. But the fact that the global economic slowdown is affecting the US is hard to dispute, and at least raises the possibility that interest rates could remain at historic lows for several more years.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "When the Federal Reserve decided that it was time to start normalizing interest rates", "title": "Here\u2019s Why Interest Rates Could Be Locked in Until 2018", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/19/Here-s-Why-Interest-Rates-Could-Be-Locked-Until-2018", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/vector-percentage-crushing_GJhtMCid_L.jpg-2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/19/Here-s-Why-Interest-Rates-Could-Be-Locked-Until-2018", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/vector-percentage-crushing_GJhtMCid_L.jpg-2.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "When the Federal Reserve decided that it was time to start normalizing interest rates", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThis development is not adequately captured by looking at the fed funds rate alone.\nBut the fact that the global economic slowdown is affecting the US is hard to dispute, and at least raises the possibility that interest rates could remain at historic lows for several more years.\nIn light of this, no further tightening of fed funds is warranted this year or next.\u201dThe Fed, of course, doesn\u2019t take its marching orders from international bankers.\nRelated: Liberal Economists Challenge Sanders\u2019 Economic MathOn Thursday, BNP Paribas analysts released a markedly pessimistic assessment of the US economy\u2019s short-term future and the effect it will have on interest rates.\nNow, however, with the state of the economy in serious question, analysts are beginning to question whether there will be any more movement in rates before 2018."}
