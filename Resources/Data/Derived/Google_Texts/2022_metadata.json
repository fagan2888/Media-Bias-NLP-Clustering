The ensuing rise of Speaker Paul Ryan has been historic in its own right, but not enough attention has been paid to what precisely led Republican activists and primary voters to demand that their own party leadership resign. In one poll, an astounding 72 percent of GOP voters said they were dissatisfied with then-Speaker Boehner\u2019s and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s performance in Congress. That\u2019s not all that different from how Democrats felt about those same Republican leaders.\n\nHow did we get here? And where is this strain of Republican anger coming from?\n\nAfter years writing and researching this topic, my official answer is this: There has been a massive \u201cdeleveraging\u201d of the economic, political and social power that a coalition of predominately white, male and Christian individuals and allies have enjoyed for a very long time, and that because congressional control can never restore more than a fraction of the old guard\u2019s former power, a broad majority of these individuals\u2014today\u2019s Republican activists\u2014now suspect that their own leadership must be the true reason why things haven\u2019t changed for the better.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot to unpack here, but essentially, the thrust of the past 50 years of American history has been the expansion of economic and political rights for women, people of color, LGBT Americans, immigrants and even citizens of foreign countries through free trade agreements and global economic competition. In other words, power that was once artificially \u201cleveraged\u201d to give outsize economic and political advantage to the few has been dispersed to broader swaths of the country and the rest of the world.\n\nIn reaction to these trends, Republican activists have quite intuitively mobilized to restore their old power and to \u201cmake America great again.\u201d The election of our first African-American president, a massive economic recession, and the creation of a new entitlement through healthcare reform brought these Republican activists to the political forefront and gave the movement tremendous energy.\n\nBut as most of us realize, the drivers of the deleveraging are here to stay. Global economic competition isn\u2019t going away, women aren\u2019t going to withdraw from the workforce, and the continued diversification of our nation is only going to speed up. So as Republican activists have demanded that their elected representatives \u201creleverage\u201d their old power, they\u2019ve butted up against the reality that the old America is long gone.\n\nAll of this makes Republican activists quite angry: They keep winning elections, but their day-to-day power doesn\u2019t seem to have increased. And of course, Republicans aren\u2019t the only ones who are angry about broader economic and political changes. By plenty of survey measures, Democrats are angrier about the government than Republicans. But for some reason, Republican anger doesn\u2019t get foisted just on the opposing party\u2014it somehow metastasizes and lands on the Republican Party as well. Democrats are just as angry, but they\u2019re not threatening to shut down the government and send Nancy Pelosi into an early retirement. What makes these two forms of anger different?\n\nThe key difference is that Democratic anger is fueled by government inaction due to perceived corporate power and money, and this creates an entirely different set of behaviors and norms for Democratic voters. Democrats understand that under our system of checks and balances, the only way you can make progress is by forming coalitions and compromising with potential opponents. It\u2019s why survey after survey shows that the most liberal Democrats are most in favor of political compromise:\n\nBut look who opposes compromise the most: conservative Republicans. These are the folks who are most active in the party, who turn out in the greatest numbers in primary elections, and who provide the decisive support candidates need to get to Congress in the first place. And these Republican primary voters simply do not want their elected officials compromising with Democrats or even moderate Republicans.\n\nBut why such hatred of political compromise? Why deny reality and insist on shutting down the government or defaulting on our debt when our system of government demands compromise at some point?\n\nThe answer isn\u2019t all that remarkable: Republican activists rightly recognize that political compromise has propelled the deleveraging and will continue to propel it in the future. Congress more than ever has to incorporate the policy demands of women, people of color, immigrants, LGBT Americans and religious minorities. The very act of legislating means these groups have a seat at the table. For them, working with them in any capacity prevents a unilateral releveraging of the old guard\u2019s power. Compromise just benefits the enemy.\n\nThis inability to releverage even with congressional control maddens Republican activists and primary voters even more than when they didn\u2019t control it. After all, they\u2019ve done their job. They\u2019ve taken back Congress and given their representatives strict orders to take back the country. And yet, the releveraging hasn\u2019t occurred. To these primary voters, somebody clearly isn\u2019t doing their job.\n\nThis is how Republican anger gets transferred from Democrats and onto their own party leadership. If Republican primary voters have won, and things haven\u2019t gotten any better, it must be because someone has sold them out. This conclusion is reinforced almost daily for anyone who consumes conservative media.\n\nAs a result, the majority of Republican primary ballots cast today end up conveying a kind of protest message: give me back my power, or nobody else gets anything. Obamacare isn\u2019t going to be repealed? We\u2019ll shut down the entire federal government. Planned Parenthood isn\u2019t going to be defunded? We\u2019ll take down our own speaker. You want us to compromise? We\u2019ll make sure you never work in Congress again.\n\nAnd that\u2019s where Republican anger ultimately comes from: You are told that your demands will not be met. You are told that you can win every election you want, but eventually, you\u2019re going to have to compromise your beliefs. You see your status in America and in the world being diminished, and you are told by the leaders of your own party that your fixes are unrealistic, and that they will prevent the party from attracting moderates and winning back the presidency.\n\nAnd you, as a voter, hear all of this, and you proudly stand up and shout with all of the emotion you can summon, \u201cYou know what? Fuck that!\u201d\n\nNormally, activist movements like these burn out as the rest of the electorate wakes up and pushes back. But thanks to an incredibly successful Republican gerrymander following the 2010 midterms, the rest of the electorate has nowhere to push. Democrats and moderates can\u2019t make a difference in 90 percent of the congressional districts in the country. These are contests strictly between candidates vying for the support of Republican primary voters.\n\nWhen all of these forces are taken into account, it\u2019s no wonder Congress looks the way it does today. It\u2019s why Congress still only gets a 14 percent approval rating, even though it is completely run by one of the majority parties. It\u2019s why so many members of Congress are willing to shut the government down, even when they have no chance of winning the underlying policy fight. And it\u2019s why John Boehner felt compelled to resign his position despite leading his party back to power in both chambers of Congress, and why Kevin McCarthy couldn\u2019t secure the votes necessary to succeed him.\n\nWhat will bring an end to the cycle of Republican anger? Circle Nov. 8, 2022, on your calendars. This is the next election that will take into account the next nationwide redistricting, perhaps finally making these congressional Republicans susceptible to overriding voter opinion on political compromise. But if the gerrymanders remain, don\u2019t be surprised if\u2014even in 2030\u2014Republicans keep saying that Congress isn\u2019t listening to the people, even if they control the whole damn thing.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Want to understand the roots of modern GOP anger?
