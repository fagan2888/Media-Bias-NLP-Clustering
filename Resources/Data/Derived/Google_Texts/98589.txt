Bobby Jindal refuses to state whether he has decided to run for POTUS or if he just likes to visit Iowa, New Hampshire, and conservative retreats. Da Gov’ still found himself running in an election this weekend. Jindal was candidate in the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC)’s straw poll and he did not fare well.

Bobby J finished 11 in the faux GOP primary. Jindal netted 0.9 percent of the vote. However, “undecided” edged out the Louisianan with 1 percent of the vote. The Governor did manage to beat Sarah Palin, Mike Huckabee, Pataki, and John Bolton in the crowded field.

At the top of the ladder, Rand Paul led the pack with 25.7 percent followed by Scott Walker (the Governor, not the NOLA telejournalist) with 21.4 percent. Donor favorite Jeb Bush pulled only 8.3 percent.

3,000 registrants voted in CPAC's 2015 poll, with a plurality of those being 18-25 year-olds. Pundits caution that CPAC’s straw poll is less than a scientific measure. As the name suggests, the groups skews conservative and candidates are known to bus in supporters to bolster their showing.

Jindal also took his turn addressing the right wing faithful. His speech was standard fare: repeal Common Core, repeal Obamacare, and POTUS is weak on national security.

Now a familiar refrain, Jindal echoed his recent comments on the threats of radical Islam. “Well, certainly we’re not at war with Islam, but we are at war with radical Islam. If we have a president who won’t even identify the threat that we face, how can we count on him to effectively win at this war?”
