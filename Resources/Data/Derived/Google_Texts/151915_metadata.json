Thornhall, was first mayor of Metuchen.\n\nThe author believes her grandmother, Daisy Thornhall, inspired her to pursue writing.\n\nThe spirit literally moved Connie Hope to take her dream of capturing readers' imaginations and making it a reality.\n\n\"Write your book! Now! Get to it! It's your time,\" are the words that came to the Metuchen native as she was taking in some sun on her lanai in Fort Myers, Florida. \"And that is what I did.\"\n\nThe vocal motivation, believes Hope, came from her grandmother, Daisy Thornhall, who owned a tea room in Metuchen in 1932. A very spiritual person who believes in ghosts, Hope didn't learn about her grandmother's business until she delved into the first of five books her father compiled which chronicled her family's rich history in the borough.\n\nSince that extraordinary encounter, Hope has penned a cookbook about side dishes entitled, \"In Addition\u2026to the Entr\u00e9e\" and the first of a three-part trilogy, \"The Bonnie Neuk Tea Room \u2014 Friends and Uninvited Guests.\"\n\n\"I come back to Metuchen a few times a year,\" noted Hope, whose great-grandfather, William R. Thornhall was the borough's first mayor.\n\nHolding dear the memories she has of her life in Metuchen, the author has shared cherished photographs, deeds and letters with the Borough Improvement League and Metuchen's historical society, so that her family history may be further preserved.\n\n\"A lot of 'The Bonnie Neuk Tea Room' is based on the history of the borough,\" she said, adding that she called upon many of the historians to help her conduct the research for her book.\n\n\"Metuchen was such a wonderful place to grow up. You knew our neighbors, they always helped you out,\" she opined.\n\nIn explaining her family history, Hope stated, \"My grandfather died very young, leaving my grandmother with young children that she had to support.\"\n\nThe urge to write about that history, as well as her passion for cooking, also has a history of its own, dating back to when the author was in the fifth-grade and entered a writing contest entitled, \"What is Patriotism?\" for CAR (Children of the American Revolution).\n\n\"My mother said that I had to earn a living and that I wasn't going to do that being a writer,\" she recalled. \"I went to Trenton State (now The College of New Jersey) to become certified as a teacher, although I never taught. I finished in 1985 and they were letting teachers go at that time. So, I worked as a credit assistant and an office manager.\"\n\n\"Still, I kept thinking of how much I would love to write,\" added Hope, who married, raised three children and divorced before moving to Florida.\n\nA bad housing market put the brakes on Hope's goal of working as a mortgage clerk. But, it was the day that she heard that phantom voice on her lanai that her true dream was realized.\n\n\"I thought, 'This is weird' because there was no one there,\" she said, stressing that she believes it was in fact a visit from her grandmother. \"She's always been my touchstone in life. We had a close relationship.\"\n\nHope's first book, \"In Addition\u2026to the Entr\u00e9e,\" underlines her love of cooking, which echoes memories from past culinary collaborations with her relatives. Selling 600 copies of the book that took approximately a year and a half to write, Hope tantalized palates with her recipes for appetizers, salads, soups, chutneys, and all side dishes that complement entrees.\n\n\"After that book, I kept thinking that I had a story in me that I needed to just sit down and write,\" said Hope, who became a member of the Gulf Coast Writers Association, which provided a plethora of feedback and pointers to the writer.\n\nAs \"The Boonie Neuk\" book started to take shape, Hope found that the writing process was not laborious, but that the words flowed freely, even as she carried around a notebook in her purse to jot down ideas and story angles.\n\nIn the self-published book, the main character of Victoria Storm grapples with divorce and the urge to do something different with her life when she receives a mysterious telephone call from someone who tells her to open a tea room similar to her grandmother's in Metuchen.\n\nAcknowledging that her life mirrors Storm's, Hope added that her book takes readers on an adventure filled with mystery, romance, emotion and encounters of all kinds.\n\nSince \"The Bonnie Neuk\" is going to be a trilogy, the author has been busily working on its second installment. When the trilogy is completed, Hope seeks to work on a book about five women who went to school together, became widows and disconnected from each other until meeting up at their reunion. The book will chronicle what happens when the women decide to live together.\n\nUntil then, Hope has been organizing Metuchen High School's 50th class reunion. She graduated in 1965.\n\nFor more information, visit www.thebonnieneuktearoom.com.
