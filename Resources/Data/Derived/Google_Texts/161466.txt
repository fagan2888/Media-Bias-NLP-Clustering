A federal judge in Eugene went above the recommended three-year sentence in a plea deal and sentenced Albany developer Joe LaCoste to five years in prison.

LaCoste was accused of stealing from investors and he was sentenced Thursday for conspiracy to commit securities fraud.

The Register-Guard reports that Judge Ann Aiken also ordered that when he gets out of prison, LaCoste must stay out of Linn, Benton, Lane and Marion counties.

LaCoste is a former Oregon State University football player and high school wrestling coach in Albany who started Willamette Development Services in the real estate boom.

LaCoste and his partners took more than $5 million from more than 50 investors for real estate projects. The company collapsed in 2008.
