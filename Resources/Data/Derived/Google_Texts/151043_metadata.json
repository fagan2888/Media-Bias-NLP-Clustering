Proposed are criminal background checks, privacy training, proof of identity, and evidence of financial responsibility for individuals providing the navigator assistance.\n\n\u201cIn Texas, we are being vigilant about safeguarding privacy and keeping personal information out of the wrong hands,\u201d Commissioner of Insurance Julia Rathgeber said in a statement. \u201cThese proposed rules address insufficiencies in federal regulations and make the training and qualifications of navigators in our state more readily apparent to consumers and service providers.\u201d\n\nNavigators are already required to undergo training on specific health plans, privacy standards, and eligibility requirements for the ACA\u2019s tax credits and subsidies.\n\nThe Insurance department will hold a public hearing Dec. 20 and accept public comments until Jan. 6. The rules would go into effect soon after the public comment period ends. There are about 200 federal navigators across the state.\n\nLt. Governor David Dewhurst echoed Rathgeber, with more political fervor.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to the Obama Administration\u2019s encroachments on the individual liberties of Texans, the hits just keep on coming,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cAs they attempt to recruit enrollment in Obamacare, this cadre of \u2018navigators\u2019 cannot get unregulated access to people\u2019s personal information the way they might in other states. Considering the litany of failures and excuses that accompanied the launch of the healthcare.gov website, we must be on guard against the continuing missteps of the Obama Administration. I applaud the Texas Department of Insurance for taking the initiative to regulate the Obamacare navigators as a way to protect our citizens.\u201d\n\nCritics aren\u2019t buying the department\u2019s \u201cconsumer protection\u201d platform.\n\n\u201cThis is an attempt to add cumbersome requirements to the navigator program and deter groups from working to enroll Americans in coverage in the Health Insurance Marketplace,\u201d Joanne Peters, a spokeswoman for the federal Department of Health and Human Services, told the Washington Post. \u201cThe navigator program is similar to Medicare counselors, which have existed for years and never faced this kind of scrutiny from Texas. Despite the state\u2019s efforts, we are confident that navigators will continue to help Texans enroll in quality, affordable health coverage.\u201d\n\nSenate Bill 1795\u2014passed by the Texas Legislature\u2014requires the Commissioner of Insurance to set standards ensuring that navigators can perform their required duties if federal standards are determined to be insufficient, Rathgeber said. The department posted an outline of concerns with federal regulation of navigators on Nov. 15, following an informal stakeholder meeting conducted on Sept. 30.\n\nIn addition to the background checks, navigators would be prohibited from:\n\n\u2013 Charging consumers for providing information about health coverage\n\n\u2013 Selling, soliciting, or negotiating health insurance coverage\n\n\u2013 Recommending a specific health benefit plan\n\n\u2013 Providing advice regarding substantive benefits or comparative benefits of different health plans\n\n\u2013 Engaging in electioneering activities or financing or otherwise supporting the candidacy of an individual for government positions\n\nThe news comes on the heels of last month\u2019s revelation that Dallas-based navigators had urged consumers to lie in order to get lower Obamacare insurance rates. A video\u2014produced by conservative activist James O\u2019Keefe\u2014shows the four employees during explanatory meetings with potential health insurance enrollees. The three navigators advise a man posing as a college student, telling him not to report the outside income on his health insurance application, and not to divulge that he occasionally smokes.\n\nFollowing the release of the video, the Urban League of Greater Dallas suspended three employees and fired a fourth.\n\nAnd in September, Woodlands-based Cardon Outreach returned more than $800,000 in navigator grant money, claiming that those opposed to the healthcare law were making it difficult for the programs to launch. Cardon\u2019s funds were to be used to hire people in four states to help explain the ins and outs of the health insurance exchanges to millions of the uninsured.\n\n\u201cThe emerging state and federal regulatory scrutiny surrounding the Navigator program requires us to allocate resources which we cannot spare and will distract us from fulfilling our obligations to our clients,\u201d Cardon officials said in an email to the federal government.\n\nAt least 16 states have passed legislation or written rules to require navigators to obtain licenses or certification before helping consumers. Seven other states\u2014Georgia, Illinois, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, Ohio, and Virginia\u2014passed regulations on the types of advice navigators could offer, according to Stateline.\n\nRead the entire proposed regulation below:\n\nTexas Navigator Rules Proposal by Bradford Pearson", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "D Healthcare Daily", "description": "Texas Insurance Commissioner Julia Rathgeber The Texas Department of Insurance has proposed rules to add extra protections for consumers who seek assistance from federal health exchange navigators, the department announced this week.
