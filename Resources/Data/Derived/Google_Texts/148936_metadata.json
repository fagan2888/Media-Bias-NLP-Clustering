But you may have no idea how much a particular model can save you in energy costs, or what you should spend for the best performer \u2013 something Meritage Homes will clear up today at any of 13 neighborhoods between Castle Rock and Fort Collins.\n\nAt any Meritage community, you\u2019ll find at least one home ready for move-in, and every home will have a HERS energy score at around 60 \u2013 so low that it\u2019s designed to perform more than 50 percent better energy-wise than an average new home built to code. If you\u2019re comparing to older homes (average HERS scores for those are around 130) the savings are even more dramatic.\n\nBuy that home now, and Meritage will take $15,000 off the price. The offer applies to any home that\u2019ll be ready for move-in this summer \u2013 such as a 3-bedroom Salida waiting now at The Preserve in Brighton, an attractive enclave with extra-wide sites, around a mature park that has views west to the mountains. That Salida (you can also tour it as a furnished model) has 2,246 square feet plus basement and 3-car tandem garage; and Meritage has upgrade the cabinetry, installed granite counters and expanded the hardwood flooring. It\u2019s ready to move into at $323,218 \u2013 but you can take $15,000 off if you buy now.\n\nMeanwhile, the HERS rating on the Salida (61) is set up to save the buyer around $85 a month in energy costs over a typical new home \u2013 over a thousand dollars a year; enough to take a serious bite out of a kid\u2019s college tuition over a lifetime of home ownership. If you want, Meritage can add a solar system and make the savings much higher still.\n\nAt the Preserve or at any other Meritage neighborhood, you\u2019ll see sharp looking architecture that appeals to the eye and offers families great flexibility in how they choose to use space. What\u2019s more difficult to see is how Meritage builds its homes to create those savings while keeping its construction costs right in line with other builders. So you\u2019ll find an \u2018energy information center\u2019 built into many Meritage model centers that let you see the spray-foam insulation and the window design, and let you experience how well those work.\n\nYou\u2019ll find one at Water Valley in Windsor, east of Loveland from I-25 on Crossroads Boulevard to New Liberty Road; at Rocking Horse, a countrified neighborhood between south Aurora and Parker served by Douglas County Schools, east of E470 on Gartrell Road; and at Silver Creek in Lafayette, north of Baseline Road on Crossing Drive to Cabrini. The Preserve in Brighton is north of 160th on Telluride. All 13 Meritage communities have at least one home for quick delivery with the $15,000 discount; check MeritageHomes.com for exact directions.\n\n$15,000 off price of any home ready for quick delivery by Meritage Homes, available in 13 Front Range communities including in Arvada, Erie, Castle Rock, Parker, Aurora, Lafayette, Brighton, Longmont, Thornton, Fort Collins, Windsor and Timnath. Energy Learning Centers in most communities; Home Energy Rating System scores average below 60\n\nFrom $250s to $600s\n\n303-406-4300\n\nMark Samuelson writes on real estate and business; you can email him at mark@samuelsonassoc.com.You can see all of Mark Samuelson\u2019s columns at DenverPost.com/RealEstate.
