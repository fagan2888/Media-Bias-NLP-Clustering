Pitman\n\nStaff Writer\n\nFederal and state legislators receive thousands of calls, emails and letters annually from their constituents seeking information, offering ideas or complaining about votes or legislation. How quickly they respond to those communications can depend on the size of their staffs and political profile.\n\nBut being responsive to the people they represent is crucial for any politician who wants to keep his or her job and get re-elected, said Mack Mariani, a political science professor at Xavier University.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s obviously one of the key roles legislators play, to be a voice for the people in the legislature,\u201d Mariani said.\n\nTo test the responsiveness of the nine state representatives, U.S. senators and congressmen representing Butler and Warren counties, The Journal-News partnered with local residents to send each elected official a letter requesting information. The newspaper mailed five letters on Oct. 22 to state representatives Pete Beck, Wes Retherford, Bill Coley, Shannon Jones and Margie Conditt. State Rep. Tim Derickson did not receive his letter due to a mailing error.\n\nThis newspaper also sent three emails on Oct. 18 to U.S. House Speaker John Boehner and Sens. Sherrod Brown and Rob Portman via their websites.\n\nAs of Friday, only four elected officials \u2014 Boehner, Beck, Conditt and Retherford \u2014 had responded.\n\nBoehner\u2019s office had the swiftest response, sending a four-page form letter just three days after the email was delivered. Boehner\u2019s letter talked about federal spending, debt, the government shutdown and the Affordable Care Act, but did not address the main subject of the test letter which asked: \u201cWhat have you done to further advance the 8th Congressional District and Butler County?\u201d\n\nConditt\u2019s office replied within a week to the letter with a two-page letter of her own that addressed all the points and questions asked of her. Beck, who represents parts of Warren County and Middletown, sent a response two weeks later that told the letter writer to call him or arrange a meeting so they could have a conversation.\n\nRetherford\u2019s office sent an email reply three weeks later that directly addressed the letter\u2019s question, which asked what specifically the state representative had done while in Columbus.\n\nMariani, who worked several years for former New York Congressman Bill Paxon and as chief of staff in the Monroe County (New York) Legislature, said as delegates of their districts the job of state and federal legislators is \u201cto do what the people want them to do, and that requires the legislator to be in touch with the constituents on a regular basis.\u201d\n\nAnd while it\u2019s more difficult to communicate directly with elected officials at the national level, he said, \u201cWe kind of expect even more for state legislators.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s much easier in the state legislature for people to go to see their legislator,\u201d Mariani said. \u201cAnd state legislators have a lot fewer staff (members), so there\u2019s much more opportunity to engage legislators.\u201d\n\nBoehner represents Ohio\u2019s 8th Congressional District, which covers all of Butler, Preble, Darke, Miami and Clark counties, and the southern part of Mercer County. More than 720,000 people, according to the U.S. Census, reside in this district. Boehner\u2019s office reports to have responded to more than 45,000 constituent inquiries in 2013, which does not include the several \u201cOpen Door\u201d meetings held around the six-county district every month.\n\n\u201cThe number of letters, calls or emails we receive from constituents varies, but each individual who contacts the office from the 8th District of Ohio receives a response from Congressman Boehner or a member of staff,\u201d said Brittany Bramell, spokeswoman for Boehner. \u201cCongressman Boehner considers correspondence with constituents the most important responsibility he has as a representative. In fact, he is active in the process to ensure all of our constituents are receiving up-to-date responses as quickly as possible.\u201d\n\nBut not all people see his availability that way.\n\nHeather Komnenovich, a Hamilton resident, said she called the Speaker\u2019s office wanting to talk with Boehner about the Affordable Care Act.\n\nShe asked to have a time to talk with him in October, and his office said that wasn\u2019t going to happen because the partial government shutdown was just beginning. Komnenovich tried to arrange another conversation with Boehner after Congress passed a budget bill to reopen the federal government, and she got the same response: he\u2019s too busy.\n\n\u201cThat makes me upset,\u201d said the Hamilton mother who is working part-time and going back to school to earn a master\u2019s degree. \u201cWhen you call, it doesn\u2019t get you anywhere.\u201d\n\nKomnenovich, who also wanted to talk about the lowered amount of funds being paid out for food stamps, said she becomes more frustrated when she sees other congressmen appearing to be more responsive to their constituents.\n\nFairfield resident Andy Glock, responding to a Journal-News Facebook posting, said he always receives a response from Congressional representatives, but \u201cit\u2019s boilerplate lip service.\u201d\n\nHamilton resident Gloria Faber said she recently called Boehner\u2019s local Butler County office staffed by aides. She said she felt the aide that spoke with her was \u201crude and could care less about our concerns.\u201d\n\n\u201cI use to believe that we were represented by people who carried out the wishes of the people, but not anymore,\u201d she wrote on the Journal-News Facebook page.\n\nSpokespeople for Portman and Brown said staff as well as the senators review each letter and attempt to respond to the people who reach out to them.\n\nIn 2012, Portman\u2019s office responded to more than 500,000 constituent letters, and this year, he has received about 45,000 letters every month, according to his staff.\n\n\u201cSen. Portman and his staff review each incoming letter and do their best to answer each inquiry as thoroughly as possible,\u201d said Michael Haidet, a spokesman from the senator\u2019s office. \u201cResponses to incoming letters and emails are personally reviewed by the senator.\u201d\n\nSo far this year, Brown\u2019s office staff has received more than 440,000 pieces of constituent correspondence from mail, emails, faxes, and more than 62,000 phone calls. Brown said representing all of Ohio is job one.\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s helping an Ohioan cut through red tape, informing a constituent about important services the federal government provides, or listening to the general views an individual has on a certain issue, I am grateful and honored that I\u2019m able to hear from and respond to Ohio constituents on a daily basis,\u201d said Brown, who said he has personally sent more than 2,500 personal notes to constituents this year.\n\nLegislative aides from the offices of Butler County\u2019s senators and representatives said they attempt to answer constituents on a timely basis. Some receive more correspondence than others.\n\nAt the state level, Sen. Bill Coley, R-Liberty Twp., represents most of Butler County \u2014 a small portion of Middletown is represented by Sen. Shannon Jones, R-Springboro \u2014 which has an estimated 370,000 people. Butler County\u2019s state representatives each represent roughly a third of the county\u2019s population.\n\nAnd talking with the people Rep. Wes Retherford, R-Hamilton, represents \u2014 no matter if they voted for him, against him or didn\u2019t vote at all \u2014 \u201cis the most important part of my job,\u201d Retherford said.\n\n\u201cI was sent up here to represent the people of the (51st House) District,\u201d said Retherford, who is nearing completing his first year in the two-year term. \u201cI have my own personal philosophies and beliefs, and I ran on them. But the fact remains that 100 percent of the people are my constituents even though 100 percent may not have voted for me.\u201d\n\nDerickson\u2019s office received about a dozen \u201ccases\u201d to handle every week, which doesn\u2019t include phone calls regarding legislation and people lobbying him to vote a certain way, said Derickson aide Spencer Gross. Derickson serves the 53rd House District.\n\n\u201cIt would be totally unreasonable to expect a constituent to know who to get in contact with in the sea of government employees,\u201d Gross said. \u201cWe are here to be representatives and advocates for our constituents and that is how Legislative Aides approach all constituent cases.\u201d\n\nConditt \u201cworks diligently\u201d to help constituents with problems \u2014 which range from taxes, consumer protection, BMV and workers compensation \u2014 or to talk about her votes in the statehouse, said office spokesman Felicia Kalan.\n\n\u201cWe manage the constituent\u2019s case by contacting legislative liaisons at various state agencies and conducting continual follow-up until issues are resolved,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes Rep. Conditt will contact the department head if the issues are complicated and not getting resolved.\u201d\n\nKalan said Conditt receives between 15 to 20 emails in a day and a handful of phone calls. Kalan said either she or Conditt will respond to personal needs, but sometimes a form letter sent by multiple constituents is sent and they will draft a response to that letter.\n\nConditt, who serves the 52nd House District, said her philosophy is following the state\u2019s Common Sense Initiative, which is led by Lt. Gov. Mary Taylor.\n\n\u201cWhen a constituent brings me an issue, the one thing I do is to apply common sense,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s helping people find solutions to their problems by cutting through red tape.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Federal and state legislators receive thousands of calls, emails and letters annually from their constituents seeking information, offering ideas or complaining about votes or legislation.", "og": {"url": "http://www.journal-news.com/news/news/response-time-by-legislators-to-constituents-varie/nbtHG/", "image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2014/08/21/53/5b/JN_Facebook_Icon.png", "type": "article", "description": "Federal and state legislators receive thousands of calls, emails and letters annually from their constituents seeking information, offering ideas or complaining about votes or legislation.", "title": "Response time by legislators to constituents varies"}, "twitter": {"description": "Federal and state legislators receive thousands of calls, emails and letters annually from their constituents seeking information, offering ideas or complaining about votes or legislation.", "site": "@journalnews", "card": "summary", "title": "Response time by legislators to constituents varies"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "journal-news", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.journal-news.com/news/news/response-time-by-legislators-to-constituents-varie/nbtHG/"}, "cmg_revpath": "/re/292/2151805/news/news/response-time-by-legislators-to-constituents-varie/nbtHG/", "keywords": "warren county,Butler County,politics,HJNhomepage", "google-site-verification": "4Q9_13tOch6eLcVYCHatUepAlnmJQbgHMCB16qdjcy0", "news_keywords": "warren county,Butler County,politics,HJNhomepage"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf91e\"", "article_summary": "Kalan said either she or Conditt will respond to personal needs, but sometimes a form letter sent by multiple constituents is sent and they will draft a response to that letter.\nBy Michael D.
