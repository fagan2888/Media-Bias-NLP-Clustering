The Nuggets had been busily trying to broker a deal that would get him on their summer league team, but were not able to secure him for the full tournament. They had held out hope that if not available for the whole thing, he might be able to play at least some during summer league, which runs from July 11-21 in Las Vegas. It remains to be seen if that can be worked out.\n\nThe second of the Nuggets first-round draft picks, shooting guard Gary Harris, is on the roster, as is Quincy Miller, who just finished his second NBA season. Also of note are local college products, Carlon Brown (CU) and Brandon Jefferson (Metro State).\n\nNuggets 2013 draft pick Erick Green is on the roster as well.\n\nHere is the full list of players:\n\nPlayer Pos.
