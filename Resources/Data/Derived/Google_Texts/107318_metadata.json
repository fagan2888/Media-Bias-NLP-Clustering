According to Deadline, the network has picked up a single-camera comedy that leans more toward the fantastical than perhaps anything before: It\u2019s about what life would be life if \u2014 get ready \u2014 your boss had a vagina.\n\nThe untitled project, which reportedly sold in a competitive situation, will be headed by Hillary Winston, showrunner of the CBS sitcom \u201cBad Teacher\u201d \u2014 another woman-in-the-workplace comedy about a \u201clady teacher\u201d who\u2019s incompetent at her job. As A.V. Club reports, Winston is less familiar with teaching and more familiar with being a \u201clady boss\u201d: The new show was inspired by her essay, \u201cWhen Your Boss Has a Vagina,\u201d which appeared in Playboy last year.\n\nIf Winston\u2019s essay is any indication of what the show will bring, then we might expect to see female bosses offering blow job lessons and, of course, good old-fashioned overblown gender stereotypes:\n\nAs an employee, I had good and bad bosses of both sexes. They could teach you how to give a blow job or they could ask for one. So I should say gender isn\u2019t a factor at all in bossing. But now, as a boss, I think it is a factor. It absolutely matters whether your boss has a penis or a vagina, because gender affects everything. Now, as a lady boss, I can be bad in all the ways any boss can. I\u2019ll have a fight with my fianc\u00e9 on the way to work and take it out on you. I\u2019ll make you work on the weekend and tell you Friday night. I\u2019ll stock the break room with snacks only I like. I\u2019ll notice when your car isn\u2019t there right at nine. I\u2019ll doubt you\u2019re really sick. I\u2019ll resent your car trouble, out-of-town weddings and dentist appointments. And yet I\u2019ll leave early just to beat traffic\u2014while you\u2019re still at work. But the real difference between having a male boss and a female boss is social customs. No matter what our roles are, we\u2019re tied to ones that have existed since way before anyone noticed the glass ceiling. You hold the door for me because I\u2019m a woman, not because I\u2019m your boss. You look at my ass because you\u2019re a man, not my subordinate. And I wear V-necks because I\u2019m a woman and I have nice tits.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Truly, a novel idea", "title": "NBC picks up a new \u201ccomedy\u201d about what happens when bosses have vaginas", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Truly, a novel idea", "title": "NBC picks up a new \u201ccomedy\u201d about what happens when bosses have vaginas", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/08/08/nbc_picks_up_a_new_comedy_about_what_happens_when_bosses_have_vaginas/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/08/sheryl_sandberg3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Truly, a novel idea", "title": "NBC picks up a new \u201ccomedy\u201d about what happens when bosses have vaginas", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/08/sheryl_sandberg3.jpg", "creator": "@@JennyKutner", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Jenny Kutner", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Bad Teacher, entertainment industry, Feminism, Gender Equality, Gender Roles, lady boss, male-dominated industries, Sexism, vaginas, women, women in the workforce, women in the workplace, Work", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The untitled project, which reportedly sold in a competitive situation, will be headed by Hillary Winston, showrunner of the CBS sitcom \u201cBad Teacher\u201d \u2014 another woman-in-the-workplace comedy about a \u201clady teacher\u201d who\u2019s incompetent at her job.\nNow, as a lady boss, I can be bad in all the ways any boss can.\nClub reports, Winston is less familiar with teaching and more familiar with being a \u201clady boss\u201d: The new show was inspired by her essay, \u201cWhen Your Boss Has a Vagina,\u201d which appeared in Playboy last year.\nBut the real difference between having a male boss and a female boss is social customs.\nI\u2019ll have a fight with my fianc\u00e9 on the way to work and take it out on you."}
