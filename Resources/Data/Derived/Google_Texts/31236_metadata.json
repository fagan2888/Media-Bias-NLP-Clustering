Well if you work for liberal magazine The New Republic, the answer is that they were too right-wing.\n\nYes, really. \u201cRolling Stone\u2019s Rape Article Failed Because It Used Rightwing [sic] Tactics to Make a Leftist Point,\u201d blares the headline of the piece, written by staff reporter Elizabeth Stoker Bruenig.\n\nWhat exactly were the \u201cright-wing tactics\u201d used by Rolling Stone, according to Bruenig? Apparently, focusing on individual cases is something that only conservatives do, while liberals focus on systematic injustices. (RELATED: New Republic: Obamacare Debate Among \u2018Most Transparent In Recent Memory\u2019)\n\n\u201cPinning an indictment of a system on the story of an individual is essentially a rightwing [sic] tactic with a dodgy success rate,\u201d Bruenig writes. \u201cIt\u2019s a way of using an individual as a metonym for systematic analysis that [liberal arts major technobabble].\u201d\n\nTo reiterate, Bruenig believes that the movement that DIDN\u2019T advance the stories of Duke Lacrosse, Michael Brown, Trayvon Martin, Sandra Fluke, Matthew Shepard, Tawana Brawley, Cindy Sheehan, Memories Pizza, Emma Sulkowicz, Mumia Abu-Jamal, and Anita Hill is the one that focuses on using individual\u2019s stories to advance a political cause.\n\nTwitter reacted with the ridicule the article so richly deserved.\n\nEverything bad is right-wing, because right-wing is a synonym for bad. We never make mistakes on the Left. http://t.co/8kNB7BuDJr \u2014 Charles C. W. Cooke (@charlescwcooke) April 6, 2015\n\nWe have reached PEAK HOT TAKE.

Seizing on anecdotes to misleadingly push a broader narrative is hardly exclusive to the right. http://t.co/ynnjJmHMxS \u2014 Radley Balko (@radleybalko) April 6, 2015\n\nWow.
