The EIA has reported crude-supply declines for the last six weeks in a row.\n\nU.S. commercial crude stocks are expected to have decreased by 2.4 million barrels in the week ended June 12, according to a survey of analysts conducted by Platts.\n\nRead: OPEC monthly oil output at highest since Oct. 2012\n\nBrent crude is approaching a key stage in its recovery from this year\u2019s lows and technical analysis over the June-July period will give an early indication of whether prices rally toward $80 a barrel, or lose steam and fall to the $50-$60 a barrel range, analysts at BMI Research, a unit of Fitch Ratings, said.\n\n\u201cOur core view is for the oil market to remain well supplied in 2015-2016 and for this to keep a lid on prices,\u201d it said. BMI forecasts Brent crude to average $59 a barrel in 2015 and $61 a barrel in 2016, on expectations that Iran will boost oil exports after a nuclear deal is confirmed.\n\nMeanwhile, markets are paralyzed by the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee\u2019s interest-rate decision and policy statement due Wednesday, as well as an imminent decision in the Greek debt debate, said Tsaklanos.\n\nElsewhere on Nymex, prices for natural gas were on the retreat after a weather-related rally a day earlier. July natural gas US:NGN15 added a half cent to $2.894 per million British thermal units.\n\nJuly gasoline US:RBN5 added 2.5 cents, or 1.2%, to $2.125 a gallon, while July heating oil US:HON5 rose 1.5 cents, or 0.8%, to $1.885 a gallon.\n\nMore from MarketWatch", "article_metadata": {"lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "description": "Oil futures log their first gain in four sessions as traders bet on another weekly drop in U.S. crude supplies.", "creator": "@MktwSaefong", "image": {"width": 1320, "identifier": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DB861_oil_ba_ZG_20141218110209.jpg", "height": 742}, "site": {"id": 624413}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "parsely-author": "Eric Yep", "article.content_group": "marketwatch", "article.section": "Markets", "parsely-type": "post", "description": "Oil futures log their first gain in four sessions as traders bet on another weekly drop in U.S. crude supplies.", "parsely-link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/oil-higher-ahead-us-supply-data-but-markets-still-cautious-2015-06-16", "author": "Myra P.
