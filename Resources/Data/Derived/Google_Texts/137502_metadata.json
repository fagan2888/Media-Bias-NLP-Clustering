The North American leaders have one bet going for Thursday\u2019s women\u2019s hockey gold-medal game and another on Friday\u2019s men\u2019s hockey semifinal. What did they bet, you ask?\n\nI\u2019m betting @barackobama one case of Canadian beer per hockey game this week. #teamusa is good, but #WeAreWinter. #GoCanadaGo @WhiteHouse \u2014 Stephen Harper (@pmharper) February 20, 2014\n\n.@pmharper and I bet on the women\u2019s and men\u2019s US-Canada hockey games. Winner gets a case of beer for each game. #GoTeamUSA! -bo \u2014 The White House (@WhiteHouse) February 20, 2014\n\nOkay, but what kind of beer? Are we going for national stereotypes, like Budweiser vs. Molson? Trendier beers, like Blue Moon vs. Moosehead? Hipster beers, like PBR vs. wait, are there Canadian hipsters? Enough with this veil of government secrecy. Beer-drinking citizens/hockey fans demand transparency! And maybe a sixer of our own!\n\nOn the whole, this is kind of a boring wager. Don\u2019t get me wrong, everyone can get on board with the swapping of some good brews, but usually the wagers are for something specific to each locale. You don\u2019t trade American apples for Canadian apples, you swap American apples for Canadian oranges. It should be maple syrup for apple pie. Justin Bieber for Miley Cyrus. Universal health care for Obamacare. Phoenix Coyotes for Winnipeg Jets. Alex Trebek for Ryan Seacrest. Vancouver for Seattle. Let\u2019s make this a painful bet to lose, not one that can be paid off after a trip to 7-11.\n\nFollowing Canada\u2019s dramatic win in the women\u2019s gold medal game, Harper tweeted that he\u2019s looking forward to some free beverages.", "article_metadata": {"description": "American president Barack Obama and Canadian prime minister Stephen Harper put down two wagers on this week's USA-Canada hockey games.
