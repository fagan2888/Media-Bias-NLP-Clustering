(AP) \u2014 President Barack Obama on Saturday fled Washington for his familiar spot on Martha\u2019s Vineyard for a two-week summer vacation, which comes as the U.S. is engaged in airstrikes against Islamic militant targets in Iraq.\n\nObama, along with wife Michelle, daughter Malia and dogs Bo and Sunny, arrived at a Coast Guard station on Cape Cod before heading to the island off the Massachusetts coast. The presidential motorcade wove its way around Martha\u2019s Vineyard before pulling down a secluded drive that led to the Obamas\u2019 rented vacation house.\n\nThe president spent just 30 minutes at the house before taking off for the golf course. Joining Obama for a round at the Farm Neck Golf Club were former NFL player Ahmad Rashad, NBA player Ray Allen, and Cyrus Walker, the cousin of White House senior adviser Valerie Jarrett.\n\nObama has spent at least part of his summer in Martha\u2019s Vineyard each year he has been president except 2012, when he was running for re-election. In an unusual twist, he\u2019s breaking up his vacation with a two-day return to Washington midway through the trip.\n\nObama\u2019s advisers have been cagey about why the president is returning to Washington, saying only that he plans to hold in-person meetings at the White House\n\nThe president typically keeps a low-profile on his annual summer vacations, making the occasional visit into town and playing several rounds of golf. But he will headline a Democratic fundraiser on the island Monday night.\n\nBefore departing Washington Saturday, Obama said told reporters that he was ready \u201cto not have a suit on for a while.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "President Barack Obama laughs while golfing with former NFL player Ahmad Rashad at Farm Neck Golf Club in Oak Bluffs, Mass., on the island of Martha\u2019s Vineyard, Saturday, Aug. 9, 2014.
