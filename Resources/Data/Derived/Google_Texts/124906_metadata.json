Six to eight teams with seven to nine members each will cover all key stock sectors.\n\nSchimel previously ran Diamondback Capital Management, a prominent hedge fund that counted Blackstone Group and many pension funds as clients.\n\nThe new unit will be based in Greenwich, Connecticut, marking the first time Chicago-headquartered Citadel will have a major presence in a state that is home to Steven A. Cohen's Point72 Asset Management and many other hedge funds.\n\nA year ago Citadel launched Ravelin Capital, a new stock picking unit in San Francisco. It also has two other units, Global Equities and Surveyor Capital.\n\nThe expansion further underscores the resurgence of Kenneth Griffin's Citadel which has steadily rebuilt since losing roughly 50 percent during the 2007-09 financial crisis on the back of riskier bets. The firm's flagship Kensington and Wellington funds gained 14 percent last year, a year in which the average hedge fund lost money.\n\nIt also illustrates how Citadel is sticking with a multi-manager platform at a time when funds with this type of format have experienced some troubles.\n\nCitadel replaced Jon Venetos as head of Surveyor earlier this year and laid off more than two dozen employees in the wake of losses.\n\n\"Investors will continue to want low net, market neutral strategies and we think this is going to be a substantial opportunity for Citadel,\" Schimel said. He also noted that it is a good time to be hiring since many smaller firms are struggling right now.\n\nFor Schimel the move to Citadel marks a full comeback.\n\nHe was forced to shut down Diamondback when the firm he co-founded with Larry Sapanski and Chad Loweth was touched by the U.S. government's insider-trading investigation. Neither Diamondback nor its founders were ever charged with any wrongdoing.\n\nFormer Diamondback partners earlier this year received a $3 million refund from the Securities and Exchange Commission paid years ago to settle civil charges related to the insider trading case.\n\nAt its peak, Diamondback employed 260, including 50 portfolio managers, and once had as much as $6 billion in assets.\n\nAfter Diamondback, Schimel set up hedge fund Sterling Ridge but like many smaller firms, it struggled to gain traction and most recently managed only about $250 million. Investors have been told that the firm is being shut down and the portfolio is being liquidated.\n\n(Reporting by Svea Herbst-Bayliss; editing by Lisa Von Ahn, G Crosse)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/20/Citadel-hires-Richard-Schimel-head-new-equities-platform", "type": "article", "site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "BOSTON (Reuters) - Hedge fund Citadel is launching a new stock-picking unit later this", "title": "Citadel to launch new stock unit, taps Diamondback Capital co-founder as head"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/20/Citadel-hires-Richard-Schimel-head-new-equities-platform", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "BOSTON (Reuters) - Hedge fund Citadel is launching a new stock-picking unit later this", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Schimel previously ran Diamondback Capital Management, a prominent hedge fund that counted Blackstone Group and many pension funds as clients.\n\"Investors will continue to want low net, market neutral strategies and we think this is going to be a substantial opportunity for Citadel,\" Schimel said.\nAfter Diamondback, Schimel set up hedge fund Sterling Ridge but like many smaller firms, it struggled to gain traction and most recently managed only about $250 million.\nA year ago Citadel launched Ravelin Capital, a new stock picking unit in San Francisco.\nThe firm's flagship Kensington and Wellington funds gained 14 percent last year, a year in which the average hedge fund lost money."}
