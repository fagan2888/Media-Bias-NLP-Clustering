A Redfern man charged over an alleged king-hit assault outside a Surry Hills fast-food restaurant on Thursday night has been denied bail.

Patrick Gardner is accused of punching Gregory Griffin, 38, in the head, knocking him to the ground in front of Hungry Jack’s on Oxford Street about 10.45pm.

Police said Mr Gardner, 27, fled the scene in a taxi soon after the incident.

Mr Griffin, who suffered serious head injuries, was taken to the intensive care unit at St Vincent’s hospital in a critical but stable condition.

Witnesses said the pair had argued inside the restaurant moments before the alleged blow was dealt.

Mr Gardner was arrested in Petersham on Friday and charged with resisting arrest, assault occasioning grievous bodily harm with intent and two outstanding warrants.

He wore shorts and a t-shirt when he appeared via audio visual link at Parramatta Bail Court on Saturday.

Mr Gardner did not apply for bail and it was formally refused by Magistrate Mark Shepherd.

He will face Central Local Court on February 12.
