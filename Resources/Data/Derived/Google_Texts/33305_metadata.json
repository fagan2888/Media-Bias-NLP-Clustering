In 2010, pressed by his supporters to stop deporting illegal aliens and unilaterally grant them legal status, Obama said, \u201cI\u2019m president, I\u2019m not a king. I can\u2019t do these things just by myself.\u201d In 2013, he said, \u201cI\u2019m not the emperor of the United States. My job is to execute laws that are passed.\u201d In fact, Obama publicly said more than 20 times that he did not have the legal authority to change immigration laws.\n\nHowever, by 2014, Obama apparently had convinced himself that he could be a king. As he remarked to the French president, \u201cThat\u2019s the good thing about being president, I can do whatever I want.\u201d\n\nSure enough. In November 2014, Obama unilaterally announced sweeping changes to our immigration laws. Afterward, Obama noted, \u201cI just took an action to change the law.\u201d Hail the emperor and new king!\n\nFeeling his kingship oats, Obama has unilaterally changed several mandates included in the Obamacare law (no authority for that). Recently, his administration issued several made-up regulations that his own treasury secretary previously admitted they did not have the authority to do.\n\nJust a hunch on my part \u2014 but I\u2019ll bet the Democrats would not be so tolerant of this abuse of power if a Republican president were making up these laws. Wake up, America!\n\nRandy Kniebes\n\nBrighton\n\nRead or Share this story: http://ldpaa.com/1T7lGW7", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Feeling his kingship oats, Obama has unilaterally changed several mandates in the Obamacare", "og": {"site_name": "Daily Press & Argus, livingstondaily.com", "description": "Feeling his kingship oats, Obama has unilaterally changed several mandates in the Obamacare", "title": "President Obama does whatever he wants, just like a king", "url": "http://www.livingstondaily.com/story/opinion/readers/2016/05/09/president-obama-american-politics/84142078/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/livingstondaily.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Feeling his kingship oats, Obama has unilaterally changed several mandates in the Obamacare", "title": "President Obama does whatever he wants, just like a king", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a032733674bb3242890ce22812214f6584dfa43c/c=300-0-1140-840&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/05/09/Livingston/B9321922067Z.1_20160509132726_000_GV1E334Q7.12-0.jpg", "creator": "@livingstondaily", "site": "@livingstondaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "fb": {"app_id": 116528121750318}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "president obama, american politics"}, "article_summary": "In 2010, pressed by his supporters to stop deporting illegal aliens and unilaterally grant them legal status, Obama said, \u201cI\u2019m president, I\u2019m not a king.\nIn November 2014, Obama unilaterally announced sweeping changes to our immigration laws.\nTake America\u2019s immigration laws.\nAs he remarked to the French president, \u201cThat\u2019s the good thing about being president, I can do whatever I want.\u201dSure enough.\nFeeling his kingship oats, Obama has unilaterally changed several mandates included in the Obamacare law (no authority for that)."}
