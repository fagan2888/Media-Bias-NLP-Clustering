It is a Q&A exploring the practical questions that consumers have about the Affordable Care Act. You can submit questions for \"Ask Emily\" at AskEmily@usc.edu.\n\nState officials have been crowing that more than 400,000 Californians have enrolled in plans through the state\u2019s health insurance exchange, Covered California.\n\nHowever, another important statistic is getting lost in the exchange hubbub, and it has to do with Medi-Cal, the state\u2019s publicly funded Medicaid program that insures low-income residents.\n\nMedi-Cal is huge. In previous columns, I described it as serving more than 8 million Californians.\n\nThat was so 2013.\n\nUnder Obamacare, Medi-Cal broadened its eligibility on Jan. 1, opening the program to more Californians, including childless adults, who previously were ineligible.\n\nHow many people have enrolled so far under the expansion? The state Department of Health Care Services, which administers Medi-Cal, hasn\u2019t been terribly forthcoming with the answer.\n\nBut it did say this when I asked: \u201cCurrent Medi-Cal enrollment is nearly 9.2 million.\u201d\n\nUm \u2026 excuse me?? That means about one in four Californians is on Medi-Cal. That also means Medi-Cal is not just huge, but ginormous.\n\nClearly, people are making it through the enrollment process. But like the folks who have wrestled with the Covered California website or waited on hold for hours without getting an answer to their question, some Medi-Cal applicants say they are hitting roadblocks that are preventing them from obtaining coverage.\n\nAnd I\u2019m hearing from them. A lot of them.\n\nToday, I\u2019m going to explain what you can do if you get tripped up in the Medi-Cal application process.\n\nAnd remember, there\u2019s no open-enrollment period for Medi-Cal like there is for Covered California and the open market. You can apply for Medi-Cal anytime.\n\nQ: I applied for health insurance on the Covered California website, and I was directed to apply for Medi-Cal.\n\nI went to the Medi-Cal website and completed their questions electronically. But I was denied based on traditional eligibility guidelines: I\u2019m not pregnant, not under 21, not a family with a child, not blind or disabled, and under 65. What\u2019s going on?\n\nA: I wish I could give Michael from Clovis a definitive answer, but I can\u2019t. I don\u2019t have enough information to say whether he\u2019s newly eligible for Medi-Cal or not.\n\nBut that\u2019s not really the point. I have received numerous emails from others who also think they have been denied Medi-Cal because they\u2019re being subjected to the old (pre-January) eligibility criteria.\n\nUnder the expansion, some key enrollment criteria have changed. The income threshold to qualify for Medi-Cal went up to 138 percent of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL). Last year, that computed to about $15,800 for an individual and $32,500 for a family of four. (The 2014 FPL guidelines have yet to be released.)\n\nAnd, as I\u2019ve already mentioned, the program is now also open to childless adults.\n\nThere are other changes that affect eligibility that I won\u2019t get into here. Suffice it to say, lots of Ask Emily readers think they\u2019re eligible under the new guidelines, but they\u2019re getting denied.\n\nThese include people who have applied online as well as those who applied through their county social services agencies, which determine Medi-Cal eligibility.\n\nNow what should they do? State officials maintain that you\u2019ll get the right answer by contacting your county directly.\n\n(You can find contact phone numbers for your county\u2019s social services agency on the DHCS website or by clicking the \u201cFind Local Help\u201d button on the Covered California home page.)\n\nCounty Medi-Cal workers have been trained in the new rules, says Tony Cava of DHCS. They \u201ccan sit down with people and ensure eligibility questions are understood and accurately answered,\u201d he says.\n\nAnd we will all live happily ever after.\n\nIf only. Some Ask Emily readers tell me that it was precisely county workers who denied them coverage or couldn\u2019t help with the new eligibility criteria.\n\nOne was Yvette of East Los Angeles, who says she is \u201cmystified and dumbfounded\u201d by a social worker\u2019s denial.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping you could give me some pointers as to how I can appeal or fight her decision,\u201d she adds.\n\nWill do.\n\nQ: Is there anything else I can do if I believe I was incorrectly denied Medi-Cal coverage?\n\nA: Yes. Appeal the decision.\n\nWhen you receive your denial letter, there will be directions on how to appeal, says Cava.\n\nYou really should do so if you believe you were wrongly denied, says Jen Flory, senior attorney at the Western Center on Law & Poverty.\n\nFlory confirms that there have been problems as Californians have tried to apply for the expanded Medi-Cal program. Most complaints come from people who applied through the Covered California website, she says.\n\n\u201cPeople have gotten some notices that have confusing information,\u201d she says. \u201cOne said something like, \u2018You may be eligible for Medi-Cal, but here\u2019s how you pick your Covered California plan\u2019.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re planning to appeal, you have to do so within 90 days. Once you do, you are entitled to a hearing within 45 days, she says.\n\nHowever, people often avoid hearings because they \u201care able to resolve the issue with a county worker ahead of time,\u201d she says.\n\nIf you do end up at a hearing, you generally will receive a decision within a month.\n\nSounds like fun, doesn\u2019t it? Luckily help is available. Flory points to the Health Consumer Alliance website: healthconsumer.org. The alliance offers programs across the state that can assist you.\n\nGood luck.\n\nQuestions for Emily: AskEmily@usc.edu\n\nLearn more about Emily here.\n\nThe CHCF Center for Health Reporting partners with news organizations to cover California health policy.
