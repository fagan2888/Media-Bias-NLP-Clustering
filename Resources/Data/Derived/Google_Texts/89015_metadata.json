The BBB Business Review of Trump Entrepreneur Initiative (formerly Trump University) has shown 'No Rating' continually since September 2015. The photo tweeted out after the debate last night did not show the current BBB Business Review or the current rating.\"\n\nThe statement comes amid an ongoing controversy over the now-defunct Trump University, which is currently embroiled in a civil lawsuit, and its previous BBB ratings.\n\nOn Thursday's debate stage, Trump said of his school, \"We have a 98 percent approval rating, we have an 'A' from the Better Business Bureau, and people like it.\"\n\nDebate moderator and Fox News host Megyn Kelly responded that \"the rating from the BBB was a D-minus, and it was a result of a number of complaints they received.\"\n\nTrump later claimed the rating was elevated to an \"A.\"\n\nAccording to the BBB statement, \"Over the years, the company's BBB rating has fluctuated between an A+ and a D-. At this time, the status is 'No Rating' because the company is believed to be out of business.\"\n\nThe BBB's refuting claim is just one of the problems to crop up out of Trump's performance on the debate stage Thursday.\n\nA CNN report filed Saturday charged Trump with breaking Fox News' debate rules, citing sources from rival campaigns and the cable network.\n\nAccording to CNN, Trump consulted with campaign manager Corey Lewandowski during the first commercial break Thursday. That contact would have violated Fox News' stated debate rules, which prohibit any contact between the candidate and their campaign.\n\nTrump's campaign has not responded to a request for comment about the CNN report.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "Donald Trump can be heard telling the debate moderators, \"Better Business Bureau just sent it...this just came in.\" But the BBB says it did not send anything.", "author": "CBS News", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/31394755/better-business-bureau-denies-debate-night-fax-to-trump", "image": "http://KOTV.images.worldnow.com/images/10035673_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Donald Trump can be heard telling the debate moderators, \"Better Business Bureau just sent it...this just came in.\" But the BBB says it did not send anything.", "title": "Better Business Bureau Denies Debate Night 'Fax' To Trump"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KOTV.images.worldnow.com/images/10035673_G.jpg", "description": "Donald Trump can be heard telling the debate moderators, \"Better Business Bureau just sent it...this just came in.\" But the BBB says it did not send anything.", "card": "summary", "title": "Better Business Bureau Denies Debate Night 'Fax' To Trump"}, "wnreadableurl": "better-business-bureau-denies-debate-night-fax-to-trump", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "KOTV", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "date": "2016/03/05", "KEYWORDS": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,newsok,channel 9,channel nine,news 9,television,this morning,live radar,kwtv,sports,video,live streaming,interactive", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS20", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,newsok,channel 9,channel nine,news 9,television,this morning,live radar,kwtv,sports,video,live streaming,interactive"}, "article_summary": "The BBB Business Review of Trump Entrepreneur Initiative (formerly Trump University) has shown 'No Rating' continually since September 2015.\nAccording to the BBB statement, \"Over the years, the company's BBB rating has fluctuated between an A+ and a D-.\nThe photo tweeted out after the debate last night did not show the current BBB Business Review or the current rating.\"\nThe Independent Journal Review posted a video to Twitter showing Trump handing a piece of paper to debate moderators during the break.\nThe statement comes amid an ongoing controversy over the now-defunct Trump University, which is currently embroiled in a civil lawsuit, and its previous BBB ratings."}
