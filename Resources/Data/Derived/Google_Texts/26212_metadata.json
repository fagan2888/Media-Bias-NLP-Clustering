The workers then joined the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) local union following the decision.\n\n\u201c[TCU\u2019s] workers really helped spark a national decision by Sodexo to reverse itself and go back on what it decided to do, which I think is a good thing for the worker\u2019s nationally,\u201d Elmo said last week.\n\nBoth UFCW negotiators and a committee of workers negotiated with Sodexo representatives last week to propose the bargaining agreement contract.\n\n\u201cThe talks were civil and professional,\u201d Sodexo Worker and UFCW Negotiating Committeeman Roy Papajohn said in the release.\n\n\u201cIt was a learning experience\u2026both sides were tough in the bargaining, but we were able to find middle ground on areas of disagreement.\u201d\n\nTuesday\u2019s meetings at 11:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. included the rest of the workers and looked to explain the contract through a presentation prior to voting.\n\n\u201cI feel we reached a fair agreement and TCU workers are happy with the final outcome,\u201d Papajohn said.\n\nElmo wrote in an email the votes from Tuesday morning\u2019s meeting were overwhelmingly in favor of ratification.\n\nThe approval of the collective bargaining agreement came almost two weeks after Sodexo announced plans to restore health coverage to its employees.", "article_metadata": {"description": "After many months filled with\u00a0benefit cuts, protesting and unionizing, change finally came for the campus food workers at TCU.
