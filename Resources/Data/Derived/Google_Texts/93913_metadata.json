At the beginning of last year, just seven California counties paid for such care. Today, all but 11 do or plan to institute at least limited local coverage as soon as next year.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, we would rather that there be a statewide solution, both for uniformity and for equity. It is odd that somebody\u2019s access to health care is dependent on where they live in the same state, that living in Riverside County versus San Bernardino County, say, there\u2019s a difference,\u201d said Anthony Wright, executive director of the consumer advocacy group Health Access.\n\n\u201cWithout a state solution, the counties are forced to address it. We do believe that as more and more counties move to see the value in providing a smarter safety net, that becomes a bridge to a statewide solution.\u201d\n\nWright said his organization sees that solution in SB 10, sponsored by state Sen. Ricardo Lara, D-Bell Gardens. The legislation proposes to seek a federal waiver allowing immigrants to purchase unsubsidized health insurance through Covered California, the state\u2019s ACA insurance exchange.\n\nIn October, Gov. Jerry Brown signed another Lara bill, SB 4, that commits state funding to include children under 19 in Medi-Cal, California\u2019s health care program for the poor, regardless of their immigration status. Officials predict the new law, which goes into effect in May, will cover an estimated 170,000 undocumented children. The expansion isprojected to cost $40 million in the next fiscal year and about $132 million annually after that.\n\nDepending on the availability of funding, SB 10 would offer either full or capped Medi-Cal coverage to undocumented adults. The state legislative analyst has not yet prepared a report on what that might cost. But last week, (Nov. 10) the Public Policy Institute of California released a report predicting that half the state\u2019s undocumented immigrants \u2013 or about 1.4 million people \u2013 have incomes low enough to be eligible for Medi-Cal.\n\nMeanwhile, for the poorest of the undocumented, access to insurance currently lies in state Welfare and Institutions Code section 17000, a Depression-era requirement that counties \u201crelieve and support all incompetent, poor, indigent persons.\u201d Since the section specifically refers to lawful residents, until recently most counties have interpreted the coverage requirement as not including people who entered the country illegally.\n\nA shift started in April with a 3-2 vote by Fresno County supervisors to accept a deal with state legislators that lets them commit $5.6 million to health care for the indigent, including the undocumented, instead of using the money to repay state road funds. The county program went into effect the same month.\n\nIn mid-June, Sacramento County supervisors voted unanimously to restore health care funding that they had cut in 2009 as part of recession-induced budget reductions. A pilot program for 4,000 to 6,000 adults ages 19 to 64 will cost the county more than $5 million this year and will rely on more than $1 million in in-kind contributions from local hospitals, a county report states.\n\nLater that same month, trustees of the state\u2019s County Medical Services Program, which pools the resources of 35 rural counties to provide health services to the poor, voted to provide basic health care to the undocumented. The board also agreed to raise the income eligibility limit for both legal and illegal residents to three times the federal poverty level, about $12,000 for an individual.\n\nIn September, Monterey County instituted a pilot insurance service that sets aside $500,000 to pay for lab tests, radiology and pharmacy services. A staff report points out that frequently, the poor can\u2019t afford such services. \u201dThis often leads to people become increasingly ill and they then require more costly hospital and/or emergency room care,\u201d the report states.\n\nA week later, Contra Costa County supervisors, who had responded to recession-related budget shortfalls by cutting services that included the undocumented, approved a renewed program. It is not full scope insurance, but will provide preventive care, assigning up to 3,000 people a \u201cmedical home\u201d at a community health center. Other benefits will include regular physician checkups, immunizations, basic laboratory and radiology services and some access to subsidies on medications. Specialty care is not covered.\n\nThose changes in recent months bring the total number California Counties offering or planning to offer insurance-like coverage plans to 47.\n\nLos Angeles resident Maria Hernandez knows she\u2019s lucky to live where she does.\n\nHernandez, 48, found out recently that she has diabetes.\n\n\u201cSince I\u2019m undocumented, I knew that I wouldn\u2019t be able to qualify for any of the insurance programs that people were talking about under Obamacare, and I didn\u2019t know what I was going to do. An illness like this can be really expensive,\u201d she said.\n\nBut Hernandez did qualify for My Health L.A, Los Angeles County\u2019s $61 million program serving the undocumented at or below 138 percent of the federal poverty level. For a family of four, that means a monthly income no higher than $2,743.\n\nMy Health L.A. offers primary care, chronic disease management, prescription medication and specialty care at county facilities.\n\n\u201cFor me, it makes all the difference between having a chance of maintaining my health and not,\u201d Hernandez said.\n\n35 miles to the east of Hernandez\u2019 south L.A. home, Ontario resident Jorge Gomez is far less sanguine. He says his chronic asthma seems to be getting worse, leaving him short of breath and sometimes unable to report to the maintenance company where he works, even when it\u2019s not severe enough to send him to the emergency room.\n\n\u201cThe doctor told me that if I don\u2019t start taking my preventive medicine, I risk permanent lung damage, but how am I supposed to pay for it?\u201d Gomez said.\n\nOntario is in San Bernardino County, which numbers among the 11 California counties that don\u2019t currently include or plan to include undocumented adults in health care that extends beyond the episodic. The others are Kern, Merced, Orange, Placer, San Diego, San Joaquin, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, Stanislaus and Ventura counties, according to a California HealthCare Foundation report published last month.\n\n\u201cThe truth is, we don\u2019t have anything in San Bernardino County that specifically addresses the undocumented because we don\u2019t know who the undocumented is,\u201d said David Wert, spokesman for the San Bernardino County Board of Supervisors.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t ask people who show up at our clinics whether or not they\u2019re documented. If they\u2019re sick, we care for them. If they don\u2019t have money, that\u2019s OK, because the state gets money from the state and federal government to pay for indigents, whether they\u2019re documented or undocumented.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s true that federal law bars emergency rooms from seeking information about patients\u2019 immigration status or apportioning care on that basis. The CHCF report notes that San Bernardino County does treat the indigent at clinics operated by its Arrowhead Regional Medical Center.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to get a really clear description of what different counties are doing with their indigent care programs,\u201d said Catherine Teare, who oversaw the research behind the report.\n\n\u201cSome counties enroll their residents into insurance-like programs. Other counties, particularly those with public hospitals, may just provide episodic care regardless of ability to pay. In both cases, the counties are getting care to their residents, but their structures are very different, and for that reason it\u2019s very difficult to compare apples to apples. On the ground, from the perspective of someone seeking care, it can be extremely difficult to identify and understand what\u2019s available, particularly where there isn\u2019t an insurance program, but rather services available through county facilities. Those not be well publicized in a way that will lead people to understand that they can get that care.\u201d\n\nWhile she said she lacks the detailed information about San Bernardino County to critique its policies, Teare said she agrees with those who advocate continuity of care.\n\n\u201cGenerally, it\u2019s great if people can seek care early in the course of an illness, before problems get bigger and they get sicker,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s typically going to be more available if you have something that\u2019s more like insurance.\u201d\n\nIn Santa Barbara County, Supervisor Steve Lavagnino said he\u2019d support expanded healthcare services for the undocumented, if religious institutions and other charities were willing to pay for it.\n\n\u201cThere are folks that are here undocumented, and I understand why they came here, but it\u2019s not up to me or any other taxpayer to subsidize their stay,\u201d he said, adding that many of his constituents who are legal residents also lack adequate medical coverage.\n\n\u201cYou have to live in the real world. It\u2019s just like if somebody came to my house and knocked on the door and said he was hungry, I\u2019d feed that person. If 10 people showed up, I\u2019d do my best to feed those people. But if 1,000 people showed up, I\u2019d have to say, \u2018You know what? I can\u2019t do it all. And that\u2019s what California has to finally realize. You can\u2019t do it all.\u201d\n\nEven when counties don\u2019t fund their own fully developed health plans that include the indigent undocumented, service levels vary widely. For instance, in Kern County, some 30 clinics operated by federally qualified health centers provide primary care on a sliding scale based on income and family size, regardless of a person\u2019s immigration status, said Bill Phelps chief of programs at Bakersfield-based Clinica Sierra Vista.\n\nHe said in politically conservative Kern County, where government revenues are largely founded on the petrochemical industry, a steep drop in gas prices makes it unlikely that local officials will expand health care entitlements to include the undocumented.\n\nAnthony Wright, the Health Access director, says the fact that local authorities are faced with such choices reflects a national failure.\n\n\u201cI people actually had the path to legal and citizen status, then you wouldn\u2019t need these workarounds at the state and county level,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut in the absence of federal action, then the question is, what do you do about Californians, our neighbors and friends, who are already here and who, like it or not, are already in the health system?\u201d\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"app_id": 1374972679394361}, "description": "Originally posted at California Health Report.
