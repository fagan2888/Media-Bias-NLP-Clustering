There were crazies, and the honest thing is, that it\u2019s sad. It\u2019s really sad to me because\u2026 I\u2019m a Republican, I\u2019m a conservative, a states\u2019 rights person, and so to me running a bill like that, the exchange, so that Colorado could control its own destiny, to me it made absolute sense. But when there are hot issues like that\u2026 People are just \u2018la-la-la\u2019 \u2014 they can\u2019t hear \u2014 you can\u2019t even get through to some people in talking about it\u2026 So during that time, you just had to say, \u2018I know who I am. I know why I\u2019m here. I know how my district would vote\u2026\u2019\n\nI saw a different light of people, because social media is in the age of the angries and the nasties and the trolls and people who just are haters in general. I had to just not read it. I had to just carry on. It didn\u2019t mean my son didn\u2019t hear things and my husband \u2014 my husband it grated\u2026 He was worried all the time, because he was really concerned for my safety. Look, when you walk to your car, when someone isn\u2019t watching \u2014 I had to be aware all the time during that period, and it\u2019s very emotionally and physically draining\u2026. I\u2019ve been followed\u2026.\n\nThere\u2019s a difference between waking up in the morning and saying \u2018I have to put my big girl\u2019s pants on because if you want to be in this game, that\u2019s what\u2019s gonna happen.\u2019 Now, that happens to some men. But I predominantly have seen people think it\u2019s freer and they\u2019re able to take aim at women in ways they wouldn\u2019t to men. I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re Annie Oakley, frankly. They will still do it, and I think it\u2019s a shame. It speaks again about our society and sometimes how we view women in power and in office, and to me it was a big learning lesson.\n\nThe only time I really would cry is when I thought about my staff\u2026 I was very worried about my staff because the door through the Majority Office \u2014 there is a secretary there and an aide there and I would \u2014 you know, when crazies are calling, that\u2019s what it is, crazies, and you don\u2019t give them place \u2014 but I always had to think \u2018What do you do in an emergency? How are we going to respond?\u2019 and those were the things for me \u2014 I was like, \u2018Okay, do I go to Home Depot and buy the thing that goes over the window?\u2019 This is what would keep me up at night. I would lay awake going \u2018[Secretary\u2019s name] has a baby on the way. Oh my god, what if something happens?\u2019 You know, my other aide had just applied to go into the Army and wanted a bright future there. Those were the things that I can remember weeping over, just, you know, during that time, because I just really wanted to secure the safety of our people there\u2026 So I hear you about thinking about an exit strategy for a baby, because I would think about those things at night.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Colorado Independent", "description": "In Colorado over the past few election cycles, partisan sniping and ideological battles have moved beyond distracting and annoying to become scary.
