Forty-five seconds later, after a Clint Dempsey shot was snuffed by the Algerian goalkeeper, Landon Donovan put home the rebound for one of the biggest goals in U.S. history.\n\nThis is how Ian Darke described it on ESPN:\n\n\u201cCan they do it here? Cross, and Dempsey is denied again \u2014 and Donovan has scored! Oh, can you believe this? Go, go, USA! Certainly through! Oh, it\u2019s incredible! You could not write a script like this!\u201d\n\nCertainly, the magic was in the moment itself. But Darke\u2019s giddy conveyance of it cemented a special place for the British commentator in the hearts of American soccer fans.\n\nSEE ALSO: Kyle Beckerman to realize World Cup dream at age 32\n\nESPN had entered the 2010 World Cup touting its lead announcer, Martin Tyler, as the star attraction. But the staid Tyler never quite seemed to connect with viewers on this side of the pond. Though ESPN announced in the midst of the 2010 tournament that Tyler would be back calling games for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, it was Darke who signed a long-term deal with the network in September 2010. And this January, ESPN announced Tyler had bowed out of 2014 coverage and Darke would be the lead voice in Brazil.\n\nDarke will call Thursday\u2019s Brazil-Croatia opener and every U.S. match in the tournament, plus selected other games. He talked to The Washington Times after the U.S.-Turkey warmup match about the growth of soccer in this country, how he prepares for his broadcasts and why his style works so well here.\n\nThe Washington Times: Many don\u2019t remember that you were part of ESPN\u2019s team for the 1994 World Cup in the U.S. How big a change has it been for soccer in this country?\n\nIan Darke: \u201cHuge. In those days you were still having to do things like, the producer was telling you to explain the offside law. Now my approach is, there\u2019s a very knowledgable audience out there, they know what they\u2019re looking at. I wouldn\u2019t do the commentary any different than I would do it for an English audience.\u201d\n\nTWT: Speaking of that, what is it about your style that helps you connect with an American audience?\n\nDarke: \u201cThat\u2019s a good question. If I\u2019m honest, I\u2019ve never quite been able to work that out. I suppose I kind of maybe commentate a little more in the style of an American commentator. I tend to sort of be a little bit excitable and maybe accentuate the drama. But I\u2019ve always believed the same thing in commentary: You\u2019re a guest in somebody\u2019s living room, and in a 90-minute [match], people can get fed up with you. They\u2019re listening to you for 90 minutes. So don\u2019t drone on, don\u2019t get boring. I try not to be. Make your points quickly, and have gears. I think you should have lots of moods in it, and I try to, if I get a chance, lighten the mood a bit; heighten the drama when it\u2019s there. It should ideally be a mix. But it\u2019s not about the commentator \u2014 it\u2019s about the game and the players. We\u2019re not bigger than the game and would never, ever pretend to be.\u201d\n\nTWT: You have described what you do as a \u201c90-minute ad-lib,\u201d but there obviously is preparation involved. How do you typically prep for a match?\n\nDarke: \u201cI\u2019ll have done background, or as much as you can do ahead of the time on each of the teams I\u2019m going to cover. Then you just stay across any developments with that team \u2014 results, injuries. Read around the subject, watch tapes. A lot of the problem we have at the World Cup itself, because we\u2019re traveling all the time, is getting to see the other games. If I\u2019m going to do Portugal next, for instance, I need to have seen their first game, but I might be hanging around Manaus airport or something. So we have to somehow get a system where we can get the tapes across, because the more recent stuff\u2019s the far more relevant. I quite like to dig out, instead of just ordinary \u2018He scored eight goals in 28 games,\u2019 which is a kind of OK little stat, but you try to get human-interest stories about the players. Something a little bit offbeat about them as well. You\u2019ve got a few good lines like that on the U.S. players that you might use at an opportune moment when they became the story.\n\n\u201cA lot of the time you\u2019re doing the prep and you\u2019ve got bags of stuff, but if it\u2019s a good game, you might only use 10 percent of that in a game. If it\u2019s a duller game, like a goalless draw, then yeah, you might feel the need to kind of bounce off Taylor [Twellman] or whoever you\u2019re commentating with more and kind of make the commentary a bit lighter. I always picture people sitting at home on their sofa with a beer and think, \u2018I\u2019d be bored if I was sitting at home watching this.\u2019 You\u2019d better come up with something to make it a bit spicier.\u201d\n\nTWT: So you do actively think about your audience as a game is unfolding?\n\nDarke: \u201cI think you need that. I think you need a kind of mental editing machine. You\u2019ve always got to put yourself in the place of people you\u2019re talking to, to some extent. I mean, I\u2019d never do that script if I had scripted the \u2018Go, go, USA!\u2019 line. I\u2019d never do that, and I\u2019m now slightly embarrassed that I did when I hear it. All I can say about that in my defense is that, at the time, at that moment as it existed, it felt like the right thing for the people who were watching it.\u201d\n\nTWT: Still, it must have been immediately apparent how huge that moment was for U.S. soccer, right?\n\nDarke: \u201cYou\u2019ve got to feel that a little bit to do it, so yeah, I think I probably did feel that. You know how much is wound up in the World Cup for the American audience in terms of the growing number of fans here. They so want the country to do well. And let\u2019s be honest, the U.S. does have a bit of a chip on its shoulder about its place in world soccer. \u2018Nobody respects us.\u2019 I\u2019m amazed at how many times I\u2019ve been asked that question: \u2018What do they think of us?\u2019 They\u2019re worried about it. But you\u2019ve made the World Cup every time [since 1990], you drew with England, you topped the group [in 2010].\n\n\u201cSo I think all wound up in that [Donovan goal] was what a moment of relief it was that they weren\u2019t out of the World Cup. I think it was a little bit of a breakthrough moment, too, in terms of, OK, here\u2019s this fairly dull game and then there\u2019s this huge moment that kind of means everything.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why you watch it, isn\u2019t it? You hope something unexpected like that comes along.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"If it's a duller game, like a goalless draw ...
