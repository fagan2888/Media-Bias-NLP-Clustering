Noting the number of people that have visited the site and their success ratio, the host unloaded:\n\n\u201cOh my God, less than 10 percent?\u201d Stewart said. \u201cHow bad is that? Twenty percent is the number of dentists who recommend sugared gum. How low is it? According to a recent poll, more of this country believes Obamacare has been repealed than have been able to sign up for Obamacare. The whole point of web sites is to design them so that it is nearly impossible to not sign up for something. Every time I go on Amazon there\u2019s a 40 percent chance I\u2019ll mistakenly overnight myself six seasons of \u2018Night Court.\u2019 It\u2019s just the way it\u2019s designed. \u2018Are you sure you want to leave this page?\u2019 Yes I am \u2014 oops, turns out I ordered something. So how are the Democrats going to spin this turd?\u201d\n\nWatch:\n\nStewart played a clip from New York Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer from NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d over the weekend, who spun it as \u201chuge\u201d since 19 million people had visited the site.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s huge,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cYou\u2019ve angered a lot of people.\u201d\n\nFollow Jeff on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Jeff Poor", "description": "\u2018Daily Show\u2019 anchor underwhelmed by health care reform\u2019s online component", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "On his Monday night program, Comedy Central\u2019s \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d anchor Jon Stewart gave a scathing critique of the rollout of Obamacare, saying \"Democrats can't spin this turd.\"    Stewart noted", "title": "Jon Stewart slams Obamacare rollout: Democrats can\u2019t \u2018spin this turd\u2019", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2013/10/22/jon-stewart-slams-obamacare-rollout-democrats-cant-spin-this-turd/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Stewart93-e1430359290884.jpg", "height": 516}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "'Daily Show' anchor underwhelmed by health care reform's online component", "title": "Jon Stewart slams Obamacare rollout: Democrats can\u2019t \u2018spin this turd\u2019 Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2013/10/22/jon-stewart-slams-obamacare-rollout-democrats-cant-spin-this-turd/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Stewart93-e1430359290884.jpg"}, "creator": "@jeff_poor", "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-10-22 11:20:30", "sailthru.title": "Jon Stewart slams Obamacare rollout: Democrats can't 'spin this turd'", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "jon-stewart,obamacare,jeff-poor", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "jon stewart,obamacare", "sailthru.description": "On his Monday night program, Comedy Central\u2019s \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d anchor Jon Stewart gave a scathing critique of the rollout of Obamacare, saying \"Democrats can't spin this turd.\"    Stewart noted", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Stewart93-e1430359290884.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca51e\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThat\u2019s huge,\u201d Stewart said.\nAccording to a recent poll, more of this country believes Obamacare has been repealed than have been able to sign up for Obamacare.\nNoting the number of people that have visited the site and their success ratio, the host unloaded:\u201cOh my God, less than 10 percent?\u201d Stewart said.\nThe whole point of web sites is to design them so that it is nearly impossible to not sign up for something.\n\u2018Are you sure you want to leave this page?\u2019 Yes I am \u2014 oops, turns out I ordered something."}
