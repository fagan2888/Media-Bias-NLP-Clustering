Bobby Jindal criticized former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush for endorsing amnesty to all of the illegal aliens who broke into the country and live here in defiance of our laws.\n\nThe hosts first tried to get Jindal to denounce GOP frontrunner Donald Trump for declaring that Mexico is sending criminals such as rapists, murderers, and drunk drivers across the border: \u201cDo you think he should be in this race? What about his comments that he\u2019s made?\u201d\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\n\u201cLook, I think anytime the donors in New York or the smart people in D.C. try to clear the field or pick a candidate, it never works,\u201d Jindal said. \u201cI trust the American people. I think the voters are getting serious. They\u2019re starting to pay attention to this race. I think they \u2013\u201d\n\n\u201cBut he\u2019s leading in the polls!\u201d the host interrupted. \u201cAmongst Republicans!\u201d\n\n\u201cI trust the American people,\u201d Jindal reiterated. \u201cAnd I think at the end of the day, they\u2019re going to vote for somebody who is an authentic outsider.\u201d\n\nJindal explained that voters felt deeply betrayed by Republicans in Congress who, after campaigning against President Obama\u2019s illegal deportation stay for minimum of five million illegal aliens, also known as executive amnesty, voted to fully fund it shortly thereafter.\n\n\u201cRight now, they\u2019re frustrated,\u201d Jindal said. \u201cThey sent Republican majorities to D.C., and nothing changed. Amnesty didn\u2019t get repealed. Obamacare didn\u2019t get repealed. We didn\u2019t see them actually balance the budget. This is where I disagree \u2014 Jeb Bush says we have to be willing to lose the primary in order to win the general election.\u201d\n\n\u201cI disagree with that,\u201d Jindal continued. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to run scared again \u2014 if we\u2019re going to try to hide our conservative principles, we will lose, and we will deserve to lose.\u201d\n\nThen, Jindal pivoted to attack Bush\u2019s extreme immigration policies. According to a CNN translation of a Telemundo interview, Bush had said in Spanish on Monday:\n\nFor the 11 million people [who are here illegally], they must come out of the shadows, receive a work visa, start paying taxes and also pay a small fine, learn English, don\u2019t receive government benefits, but they come out of the shadows and they receive legal status after some time.\n\nJindal wasn\u2019t having it.\n\n\u201cJeb came out this week, just yesterday, and said he is for amnesty for the millions of folks who are in this country illegally. I think that is a mistake. I think that is an example of voters saying, we want someone to represent us. The hour is late. And we need big change in our country.\u201d\n\nShortly after the interview, Jindal\u2019s campaign sent out an email blast to reporters:\n\nDuring a recent Spanish-language interview with Telemundo, Jeb Bush called for amnesty for those who are in our country illegally. I wish I could say I\u2019m surprised. But Jeb Bush has been clear and consistent about his belief that Republicans have to be willing to \u201close the primary to win the general.\u201d We just disagree about that. I am not afraid to stand on my conservative principles. And I\u2019m not ashamed to say amnesty for illegal immigrants is wrong. Here is what amnesty supporters in Washington on both sides of the aisle don\u2019t understand: becoming an American citizen is not a right granted to those who have managed to hide illegally in our country for just long enough. We should not and must not reward those who came to this country illegally. We should not and must not be afraid to stand on our conservative principles and defend what has made this the greatest country in the history of the world. I hope you will stand with me.\n\nWATCH:\n\nEmail Katie at kmchugh@breitbart.com. Follow her on Twitter: @k_mcq.", "article_metadata": {"description": "On CBS This Morning, Louisiana Gov.
