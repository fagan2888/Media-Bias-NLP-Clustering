Augustin\u2019s debut with the Nuggets on Friday night were a bittersweet blur.\n\nHe was traded from Oklahoma City to the Nuggets on Thursday morning. That day, he also attended the funeral of Ingrid Williams, wife of Thunder assistant coach Monty Williams, who died in a car crash a few days earlier. The next morning, with his most essential items packed, he flew to Sacramento to meet his new team, the Nuggets, at their hotel.\n\nThe airline lost his luggage.\n\n\u201c(Thursday) was kind of an emotional day,\u201d Augustin said. \u201cThe next morning, I had to leave real early. It\u2019s been rough, but it\u2019s part of the game.\u201d\n\nThirty minutes before Friday\u2019s game, the point guard was cramming whatever he could retain to be able to play with some sort of knowledge of the Nuggets\u2019 offensive schemes. Then he played well, scoring eight points and contributing six assists and three steals in 19 minutes as the reserve point guard.\n\nHis luggage made it to the arena during the game \u2014 in time for him to have it for the late-night plane ride afterward to his new city.\n\nAs for the game, Augustin was pleased.\n\n\u201cI felt pretty good,\u201d Augustin said. \u201cTrying to learn the offense and the defense, the different schemes \u2026 My teammates did a great job of helping me.\u201d\n\nNuggets coach Michael Malone was not surprised Augustin was able to be effective on the court without knowing the teams\u2019 schemes.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been in the league long enough, he\u2019s been on enough good teams and had a big role on certain teams where I knew if we put the ball in his hands and kept it simple for him, he\u2019d make the right play,\u201d Malone said. \u201cAnd he did that. The synergy that he and Joffrey (Lauvergne) had in that first half was terrific. I thought (Augustin) made some really good reads. He is a very capable and effective pick-and-roll player. That\u2019s what we allowed him to do.\u201d\n\nAugustin, as fast a guard as there is in the league, quickly got in rhythm with Lauvergne, setting the big man up time after time for easy layups and dunks out of high screen/rolls.\n\n\u201cHe gave me four or five baskets in six minutes just on pick-and-roll,\u201d Lauvergne said. \u201cSo when you start the game like this, everything is easier after.\n\n\u201cUs keeping it simple for him allowed him to play his game, and I wasn\u2019t really surprised. We liked him coming back in that trade, seeing his body of work over many years in the NBA.\u201d\n\nThe Nuggets hope things get easier for Augustin as fast as possible. They\u2019re going to need him to be the primary backup at point guard, behind Emmanuel Mudiaye, while Jameer Nelson remains out because of a wrist injury. Malone said Nelson\u2019s injury will keep him out \u201cfor the foreseeable future.\u201d\n\nAsking Augustin to know everything there is to know in the final 27 games is a stretch, but he said he\u2019ll do his best to soak in as much as he can.\n\n\u201cA few more games, a few more practices, time to sit down with coaches and watch film a little bit longer \u2026 Everybody on this team knows how to play the game,\u201d he said. \u201cJust got to go out there and play hard.\u201d\n\nBOSTON AT DENVER 3 p.m. Sunday, ALT; 950 AM\n\nSpotlight on Isaiah Thomas:\n\nThe 5-foot-9 point guard from the University of Washington is coming off his first All-Star Game appearance and 25 points in the Celtics\u2019 first game after the break, a 111-93 loss at Utah on Friday. The Nuggets did a solid job on him defensively in their 111-103 loss at Boston on Jan. 27, but Thomas \u2014 named after the former NBA star \u2014 can be an explosive scorer when he gets going.\n\nNOTEBOOK\n\nNuggets:\n\nThey returned to the practice court Saturday after their 116-110 loss at Sacramento on Friday, when they allowed 70 points in the first half. Game film and defensive work were on the agenda Saturday. \u2026 Darrell Arthur (quadriceps) made it through the game after missing the previous five. He played 17 minutes against the Kings and is expected to be available to play against Boston. Jameer Nelson (wrist) isn\u2019t expected to play against the Celtics.\n\nCeltics:\n\nKelly Olynyk (shoulder) won\u2019t be available to play against the Nuggets. He missed Boston\u2019s game at Utah too. \u2026 The Celtics waived David Lee on Friday, clearing the way for the veteran forward to sign with another NBA team. \u2026 Boston has won three consecutive games against the Nuggets.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "D.J.
