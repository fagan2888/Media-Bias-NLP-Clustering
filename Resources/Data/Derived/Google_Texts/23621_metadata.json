I thought I was going to die. I thought that was it,\u201d said Johnson.\n\nHe said he was almost certain this visit was going to be his last.\n\n\u201cNothing was said, nothing was done, no gesture, no hint,\u201d said Johnson. \u201cHe just came up from behind and was calling her all kinds of bad names, beating on her.\u201d\n\nPolice said 32-year-old Ray Perkins, a transient from Idabel started yelling obscenities at An and then attacked her.\n\n\u201cHer sister Dee started pulling him off, and of course, I heard her screaming, and I turned around and joined the effort,\u201d said Johnson.\n\nOnce they got Perkins off their friend, Ray, who's legally blind, said he was not going to let him get away.\n\n\u201cWhen I started trailing him, he turned back to me and knocked me down, got on top of me and started beating me in the face. I continued to yell and scream and ask for help,\u201d said Johnson.\n\nRon said people began to come over to help, dragged Perkins off of him, and then pinned him down until police arrived.\n\nRon said this experience will not stop him and his family from coming back to Oklahoma City.\n\nPerkins was arrested for assault and battery, but is now out on bond.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "A group of friends visiting Oklahoma City from San Antonio were attacked by a transient downtown.", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/28734751/homeless-man-arrested-after-random-attack-in-downtown-okc", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/7382547_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A group of friends visiting Oklahoma City from San Antonio were attacked by a transient downtown.", "title": "Homeless Man Arrested After Random Attack In Downtown OKC"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/7382547_G.jpg", "description": "A group of friends visiting Oklahoma City from San Antonio were attacked by a transient downtown.", "card": "summary", "title": "Homeless Man Arrested After Random Attack In Downtown OKC"}, "wnreadableurl": "homeless-man-arrested-after-random-attack-in-downtown-okc", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "KWTV", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "date": "2015/04/06", "KEYWORDS": "oklahoma city,okc,news9.com, news 9, kwtv, Downtown, Homeless", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS30", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "oklahoma city,okc,news9.com, news 9, kwtv, Downtown, Homeless"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9771\"", "article_summary": "Ron said this experience will not stop him and his family from coming back to Oklahoma City.\nHe said bringing people to Oklahoma City from around the world is something he will do as long as he can.\nRon Johnson, 66, and his two neighbors, An and Dee Lu had been touring downtown Oklahoma City.\nA group of friends visiting Oklahoma City from San Antonio were attacked by a transient downtown.\n\u201cWe missed a whole day.\u201dRon Johnson was the director of a recovery mission shortly after the Oklahoma City bombing."}
