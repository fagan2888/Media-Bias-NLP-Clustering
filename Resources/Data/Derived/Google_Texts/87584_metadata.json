They\u2019ve been unsure what to do next in their four-year-long quest to dismantle the controversial health law.\n\nThis week, they hit upon a new tack. And this one has the feel of a \u201cwin-win.\u201d\n\nObamacare has a weakness: its individual mandate, which compels most Americans to purchase government-controlled health insurance or pay a tax penalty. It\u2019s the law\u2019s linchpin. Repeal it, and the whole scheme quickly unravels. It\u2019s also unpopular \u2013 correction: extremely unpopular. Two-thirds of Americans oppose it. This holds true of every known demographic except card-carrying Bolsheviks over 80. The mandate is, in short, Obamacare\u2019s thermal exhaust port.\n\nNone of this, of course, is news. Everyone has known about the mandate\u2019s special role, and unique vulnerability, for years. What\u2019s new is the Republicans\u2019 new way of attacking it. I think it may be their savviest gambit yet \u2013 one that might even avert or at least soften the coming \u201cGOP health care crack-up\u201d that I\u2019ve been predicting.\n\nAccording to a report in Wednesday\u2019s Washington Examiner, Appropriations Committee Chairman Hal Rogers, R-Ky., has added to the IRS appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 2015 (which will be taken up this week) a provision to defund the agency\u2019s implementation of the mandate. The IRS would be barred from enforcing it.\n\n[MORE: Cartoons on Obamacare]\n\nThe provision only lasts for one year, though, making it a delay rather than a true repeal.\n\nWhat\u2019s so savvy about that? It\u2019s savvy because it doesn\u2019t repeal Obamacare, doesn\u2019t take away anyone\u2019s Obamacare subsidies, doesn\u2019t touch any of the law\u2019s more popular mandates and doesn\u2019t threaten to provoke a government shutdown. In short, it avoids all of the big pitfalls that impeded last year\u2019s tea party drive to \u201cdefund\u201d Obamacare.\n\nAt worst, the new provision will cause a temporary shutdown of the IRS. (Throw me in that briar patch!)\n\nFrom the House Appropriations Committee\u2019s bill summary (emphasis added):\n\n\n\nObamaCare \u2013 The bill also includes provisions to stop the IRS from further implementing ObamaCare, including a prohibition on any transfers of funding from the Department of Health and Human Services to the IRS for ObamaCare uses, and a prohibition on funding for the IRS to implement an individual insurance mandate on the American people.\n\nThe IRS is the only agency that can legally enforce the individual mandate. It collects the penalties. Should the foregoing language become law, the agency\u2019s hands will be tied. Americans will be free to flout the mandate with impunity. Obamacare will be weakened. And perhaps in a permanent way, if politicians follow normal behavioral patterns.\n\nOf course, the Republicans\u2019 language is unlikely to become law, thanks to the Democrats\u2019 fervent fidelity to their hard-won health care handiwork. But the debate over a delay should, if anything, help the GOP heading into this year\u2019s midterm elections. (The party is already expected to do well.) Simply by focusing its fire on the mandate, the GOP can refocus the larger health care debate around it, and thus elevate its importance in the campaign.\n\nThat\u2019s smart politics. Health care is now firmly at the top of voter\u2019s minds, according to research by The Polling Company for FreedomWorks. (Full disclosure: I helped conduct this research.) Voters usually name \u201chealth care\u201d as one of their \u201ctop 10\u201d issues. But right now it\u2019s one of the \u201ctop three,\u201d along with \u201cjobs / economy\u201d and \u201cgovernment spending.\u201d An unpublished January poll by Heart-Mind Strategies for the Heritage Foundation is even more striking, finding health care to be in the \u201ctop one\u201d \u2013 that\u2019s right, the No. 1 issue on voters\u2019 minds.\n\nIt gets better. The Polling Company research finds a solid majority of voters in every category \u2013 including the law\u2019s supporters \u2013 support a delay of the whole law, not just the mandate. Sixty percent say they favor a delay \u201cto make sure the law is fair and workable for everyone.\u201d\n\n[READ: Take a Load Off, Obama]\n\nRecent surveys suggest voters are tiring of the all-or-nothing sound of \u201crepealing\u201d Obamacare, preferring a more soothing message of \u201cfixing\u201d it. But the individual mandate is so unpopular, it seems safe to regard its elimination as a politically acceptable \u201cfix.\u201d At least, the burden of proof is on the mandate\u2019s defenders to say why not. Voters\u2019 willingness to support a delay would be even higher, of course, as I\u2019ve written elsewhere, if Republicans were offering a better alternative. But that\u2019s a whole other story.\n\nWould a delay increase the deficit? No. Federal receipts would go down a bit, to be sure. But outlays on Obamacare and Medicaid subsidies would go down even more. The ledger would show single-digit billions in costs and double-digit billions in savings. The Congressional Budget Office has verified this.\n\nA skeptic might ask: Wouldn\u2019t a delay fight just lead to another politically risky government shutdown? Answer: It need not. There could, again, be an IRS shutdown. But there\u2019s no reason to expect a full-blown, government-wide one. So the worst that would happen is tax filing season would be delayed a bit, as happened after last year\u2019s shutdown. (Did you notice? Me neither.)\n\n[SEE: Political Cartoons]\n\nIn short, the new Republican strategy places Democrats on the horns of a dilemma: They can either forsake their favorite mandate for a year or close their favorite agency for a few days or weeks. I expect they\u2019ll choose the latter. In which case, Republican candidates can tell voters: \u201cThere you have it. My Democratic opponent supports the mandate and I oppose it. I thinks it\u2019s unnecessary and he thinks it\u2019s indispensable. I think it\u2019s unfair and he thinks it\u2019s just swell. In other words, I trust you to do the right thing for you and your family, and he does not. Which raises a question: If he won\u2019t trust us with our choices, why would we entrust him with our vote?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "title": "The GOP's New Obamacare Individual Mandate Attack Might Work", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Determined House Republicans have found a new, savvier, line of attack against the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "The GOP Targets Obamacare's Achilles' Heel", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/opinion-blog/2014/06/19/the-gops-new-obamacare-individual-mandate-attack-might-work", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/30/24/de38226b42619c160da43d4a2908/toon12.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "The GOP's New Obamacare Individual Mandate Attack Might Work", "description": "Determined House Republicans have found a new, savvier, line of attack against the Affordable Care Act.", "card": "summary", "site": "@USNews"}, "site": "opinion", "date_published": "June 19, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Dean Clancy,Affordable Care Act,health care reform,Republican Party,picks,Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Determined House Republicans have found a new, savvier, line of attack against the Affordable Care Act."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfadc\"", "article_summary": "They\u2019ve been unsure what to do next in their four-year-long quest to dismantle the controversial health law.\nHealth care is now firmly at the top of voter\u2019s minds, according to research by The Polling Company for FreedomWorks.\nI think it may be their savviest gambit yet \u2013 one that might even avert or at least soften the coming \u201cGOP health care crack-up\u201d that I\u2019ve been predicting.\nSimply by focusing its fire on the mandate, the GOP can refocus the larger health care debate around it, and thus elevate its importance in the campaign.\nThere could, again, be an IRS shutdown."}
