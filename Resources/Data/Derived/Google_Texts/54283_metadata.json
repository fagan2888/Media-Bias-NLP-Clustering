This mental illness debilitates nearly 15 million Americans of various income levels, races, and walks of life annually. Left untreated, it can lead to suicide, as seen in Williams\u2019 case.\n\nWhile mental health professionals encourage a range of treatments for depression \u2014 including the use of antidepressants and electric shock therapy \u2014 another effective way to overcome a perpetual melancholic state may be opening up to others. Comedian Jay Pharoah took heed to those words, recently appearing on HuffPost Live to reflect on his \u201cconstant state of depression\u201d as an overweight teenager.\n\n\u201cI was depressed when I was a kid. I remember when I was 12, that was a really, really bad time. \u2026It wasn\u2019t a good situation, and my mom was there to kind of help me through it,\u201d Pharoah, currently a cast member of NBC\u2019s Saturday Night Live, said. \u201cShe was like one of the only people that really knew about it. \u2026At the time, when I was really massively depressed like that, when I really didn\u2019t want my life anymore, I was 12. And I remember she came in and she stopped me from doing some stuff. It was crazy.\u201d\n\nThe National Alliance on Mental Illness encourages discussion along the lines of what Pharoah mentioned, saying that it helps to break down \u201cbarriers of ignorance, prejudice, or unfair discrimination\u201d against people who suffer from mental disorders.\n\nSuch stigma often limits access to care and discourages people from seeking treatment. Institutionally, depictions of the mentally ill as the \u201cother\u201d allow for exclusion from employment, social, and educational opportunities. Stereotypes about the mentally ill also lower the likelihood that a health care provider will have a patient\u2019s best interests in mind. In turn, those who suffer from mental illness may internalize these negative thoughts, causing them to hide their disorder to their detriment and that of others. This fear perpetuates the cycle of social isolation.\n\nBut the tide may be starting to shift. Pharoah\u2019s recent comments follow similar personal details from Supernatural\u2019s Jared Padalecki, who disclosed his ongoing bout with depression to his Twitter followers in May after canceling several public appearances. Last month, fans cheered on Padelecki and lit candles in the actor\u2019s honor as he entered the stage at San Diego Comic-Con.\n\nSinger Demi Lovato, who has publicly dealt with bipolar disorder, has stood on the front lines in the fight for mental health care reform, including at an event sponsored by the National Alliance on Mental Illness. \u201cIt\u2019s important that we\u2019re able to talk about\u201d mental health, Lovato told Yahoo Health News earlier this year. \u201cThe more we\u2019re able to talk about it, the more understanding we are, and [the more] compassionate [we can be] about what we\u2019re going through.\u201d\n\nA commitment to helping others cope with their issues compelled singer Mary Lambert to talk about her bipolar disorder in her song \u201cSecrets,\u201d an experience she reflected on during a recent interview.\n\n\u201cWhat if I start the song by telling everybody that I\u2019m bipolar?\u2019 And the whole room was like, \u2018Are you sure you want to do that?\u2019 And I was like, \u2018Hell yes I do!'\u201d Lambert said. \u201cI think it\u2019s really important to destigmatize mental illness in any form. \u2026Everybody is going through something. Everybody has had something that they\u2019ve had to overcome.\u201d\n\nCases of depression appear to be on the rise. Last year, a study found that Americans are reporting symptoms \u2014 including sleeplessness and trouble concentrating \u2014 at least 38 percent more often than they did in the 1980s.\n\nJean M. Twenge, a professor at San Diego State University who analyzed the data, told CNN that an increase in discourse about mental illness may have caused a leap in reported case of depression. \u201cPrevious studies found that more people have been treated for depression in recent years, but that could be due to more awareness and less stigma,\u201d said Twenge. \u201cThis study shows an increase in symptoms most people don\u2019t even know are connected to depression, which suggests adolescents and adults really are suffering more.\u201d\n\nBut talking about mental illness could do more good than harm for those who are suffering. Research shows that when one talks about their depression, they develop coping skills that help them mitigate future stress-inducing situations. These conversations also allow the depressed person to gain perspective on problems with family, friends, and co-workers. Once they reach that threshold, they can then talk to others about their problems, further encouraging others to confront issues of their own.\n\nThe field of psychotherapy \u2014 in which one treats mental illness by chatting with a mental health provider \u2014 mostly aligns with this line of thinking, due to the manner in which therapists often help their patients outline goals to get them over their depressive state. During these sessions, therapists may also dole out assignments \u2014 including journal entries and application of problem-solving techniques. Psychotherapy has been found to be helpful in treating anxiety disorders, addiction, and schizophrenia. It\u2019s also useful in helping people learn how to come to terms with an ongoing health problem and resolve conflict.\n\nIn recent years, the tech industry has also tried to facilitate more conversation among people struggling with mental health issues, supplying new tools to help them seek help more easily. For instance, earlier this year, Facebook launched a suicide prevention tool that allows users to reach out to troubled loved ones and connect them with online resources once they spot the first sign of trouble.\n\n\u201cPeople who are feeling suicidal also feel alienated and if they\u2019re reaching out on social media, then it can be a bridge that helps them obtain really good prevention resources. Sometimes people don\u2019t know what to say to their loved one and this tool gives them some language,\u201d Lisa Horowitz, staff scientist and pediatric psychologist at the National Institute of Mental Health, told ThinkProgress in a previous interview after the unveiling of Facebook\u2019s tool.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "\"Everybody is going through something.
