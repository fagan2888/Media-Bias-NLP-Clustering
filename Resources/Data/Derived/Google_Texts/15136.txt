Insurance Commissioner Jim Donelon held off three opponents Saturday (Oct. 24) to win a third term in the office that oversees the state's insurance industry.

Donelon got past Democrats Donald Hodge Jr. and Charlotte McDaniel McGehee and Republican Matt Parker.

Donelon joined the Insurance Department in 2001, was appointed commissioner in 2006 to fill an unexpired term and won election that same year. He was re-elected in 2007 and in 2011.

Hodge and McGehee are lawyers in Baton Rouge. Parker is a Monroe businessman making his first run for public office.
