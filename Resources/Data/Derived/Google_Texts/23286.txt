*In the White House’s ongoing push for young Americans to get health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, the mothers of Alicia Keys and Jennifer Lopez appear with Michelle Obama in a new video that targets the nation’s moms – hoping they can guilt their Millennial kids into signing up.

Days after President Obama hit up Zach Galifianakis’ Funny or Die web series “Between Two Ferns,” the White House launches its #YourMomCares campaign, with a video featuring celebrity moms Sharon Feldstein (Jonah Hill’s mom), Patsy Noah (Adam Levine’s mom), Terria Joseph (Alicia Keys’ mom) and Guadalupe Rodriguez (Jennifer Lopez’s mom) reminiscing about their famous kids.

In one scene, Sharon and Patsy sit in a kitchen and discuss how their kids have driven them crazy through the years. “Adam always made me do his dirty work,” his mom says at one point.

“Trust me, us moms put up with a lot,” says Sharon, “but one thing we should never have to put up with is our kid not having health insurance.” And later, “Seriously, do you want your mother to have a nervous breakdown? … Taking care of yourself so your mothers can sleep and have a nice life after all they’ve done for you is not too much to ask in my opinion.”

“We nag you because we love you,” FLOTUS says at the end of the video, before plugging the Affordable Care Act website.
