Its \u201cLove, Hope and Pizza\u201d program awarded grants to more than 70 facilities around the country.\n\nIn Tampa, a $25,00 grant helps Moffitt Cancer Center offer 200 low-income, uninsured women free mammograms and diagnostic breast care services.\n\nThe Christine E. Lynn Women's Health & Wellness Institute at Boca Raton Regional Hospital, and Martin Memorial Diagnostic Center in Stuart are the other recipients in Florida.\n\nChristy Smallwood, who manages the breast imaging program at Moffitt, said women who can\u2019t afford screening often don\u2019t get it at all.\n\n\u201cA lot of women don\u2019t know that these services exist so they just don\u2019t have their mammogram because they don\u2019t know there are programs that can help them, Smallwood said.\n\nSmallwood also said early detection is important in treating breast cancer.\n\n\u201cIf you have a sister, mother, aunt who had breast cancer early, you need to have your first mammogram 10 years before their age of diagnosis,\u201d Smallwood said. \u201cSo if someone in your family was diagnosed at 40, you need to have your first mammogram at age 30.\u201d\n\nThe American Cancer Society (ACS) recommends women age 40 and older should have a mammogram every year and should continue to do so for as long as they are in good health.\n\nWomen 40 and older may be eligible for the screening, as well as women 18-25 with referral from their doctor.\n\nLast year, Moffitt performed about 14,000 mammograms at their three sites. About 5 to 10 percent resulted in finding cancer, Smallwood said.\n\nFor information about qualifying for a free mammogram, call Moffitt\u2019s Patient Appointment Center at 813-745-3980.\n\nDaylina Miller is a reporter with WUSF in Tampa.
