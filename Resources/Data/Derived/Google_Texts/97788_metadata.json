Thew, who works part-time as a handywoman and sells artwork, said she could not afford the premiums, although she was getting her insurance through the federal exchange set up under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cThey want more for my health insurance than what I make each month,\u201d Thew said.\n\nYet, Thew, who is currently helping remodel a foreclosed house, makes too much to qualify for Medicaid, the federal-state health care program for low-income and disabled Floridians.\n\nShe is one of approximately 1 million Floridians whose health-care coverage is in the hands of the Florida Legislature. If lawmakers agree to expand Medicaid under the federal health-care law, Thew could gain coverage. But if lawmakers again balk at the expansion it will leave Thew and many others without a safety net.\n\nThew said she is in good health and has no immediate medical concerns. She also hopes to resume her coverage in the summer when she will begin receiving widow benefits. But she said she is concerned for others who may not have her options.\n\n\u201cIt would be a godsend to a lot of people if they could do something to help us out,\u201d Thew said. \u201cI don\u2019t like to ask for help really. So I\u2019m just going without any health care insurance.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of people in worse shape than I am and they really need regular medical care. And they\u2019re not getting it. The Legislature really ought to look at that.\u201d\n\nMedicaid expansion has emerged as a top issue in the 2015 session that began last week. Momentum has built for a serious debate, helped in part by a coalition of hospitals, health care providers and business groups \u2013 which all have a stake in reducing Florida\u2019s 22 percent uninsured population.\n\nBut the real driving force has become the federal government\u2019s threat to end at least a portion of a $2.2 billion a year program that helps Florida hospitals pay for the care of poor and uninsured patients. The so-called \u201clow-income pool (LIP)\u201d will end on June 30 unless the federal government revives it.\n\n\u201cFlorida is at an important crossroads in the Medicaid program,\u201d Senate President Andy Gardiner, R-Orlando, said in a memorandum to senators on Thursday. \u201cNearly $2 billion of low income pool funding is in jeopardy.\u201d\n\nLike it did in 2013, the Senate will move ahead thist week with an alternative Medicaid expansion plan, Gardiner said.\n\n\u201cSome say Florida should not expand the existing Medicaid program and I agree,\u201d Gardiner said. \u201cBut we have the obligation to make coverage affordable and the opportunity to develop a consumer-driven approach \u2013 one that provides access to high-quality, affordable health care coverage while promoting personal responsibility.\u201d\n\nHouse leaders, who rejected the Senate Medicaid plan in 2013, remain firmly opposed to any expansion plan, arguing there is no guarantee the federal government will support the expansion in future years.\n\n\u201cAt this point in time, we're not interested in expanding Medicaid as we know it,\u201d said House Speaker Steve Crisafulli, R-Merritt Island.\n\nOne option for dealing with the potential LIP shortfall would be to use part of the state\u2019s budget surplus \u2013 estimated to be more than $1 billion in the coming year \u2013 to make up for the reduction in federal funding for the state hospitals.\n\nBut Gov. Rick Scott, who has said he would support a Medicaid expansion plan if fully funded by the federal government, issued a letter last week saying he would oppose the use of state funding to resolve the LIP problem.\n\nThat in turn prompted a response from Senate Appropriations Chairman Tom Lee, R-Brandon, that all spending initiatives \u2013including more than $500 million in tax cuts and a historic boost in school funding sought by Scott \u2013 will not be included in the new state budget until the LIP issue is resolved.\n\n\u201cUntil we get some clarity to this picture on how we are going address healthcare and unreimbursed care in the state of Florida, we are not going to be allocating large chunks of resources to any of the priorities, including individual member priorities,\u201d Lee said.\n\nHouse leaders say they will continue to build their budget proposal based on the assumption that the bulk of LIP funding will remain. \u201cIt\u2019s early,\u201d said Crisafulli about the state of negotiations over LIP and the state budget.\n\nA key question is how much LIP funding is really in jeopardy.\n\nIn testimony before the Senate Health Policy Committee, Justin Senior, who oversees Florida\u2019s Medicaid program and has been in direct negotiations with federal officials over the future of LIP, told senators it would be reasonable to assume \u201chundreds of millions\u201d of dollars may be at stake.\n\n\u201cThe federal government has definitely expressed to us a reluctance to continue to fund that portion of the low income pool that is associated with uncompensated care delivered to people that would be picked up in a Medicaid expansion,\u201d Senior said.\n\nSenior said state health officials have had trouble quantifying that number and he also said that LIP covers more than hospital care for the uninsured, including providing incentives for hospitals to treat the current Medicaid population, funding local initiatives like poison control centers and providing substantial support for state medical schools.\n\nSenior said state health care officials remain hopeful that the federal government will continue to fund \u201cthe lion\u2019s share\u201d of the LIP.\n\nNext week, the Senate Health Policy Committee will move ahead with its alternative Medicaid expansion plan (SB 7044) that would use federal funding to provide vouchers to consumers to purchase private insurance.\n\nLike an expansion plan recently approved for Indiana, the Senate proposal would require consumers to pay a premium up to $25 a month for their coverage and a fee if they use emergency rooms. Additionally participants would have to show proof of employment, on-the-job training or pursuit of education to qualify for coverage.\n\nSome advocates have already raised questions about requiring low-income Floridians to pay a premium for their coverage.\n\nLeah Barber-Heinz, head of Florida CHAIN, a consumer health-care lobbying group, asked senators not to \u201cput up too many barriers to care for the people we\u2019re trying to help.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re always going to have some concerns about, for example, premiums which will be very difficult for low-wage workers,\u201d Barber-Heinz said.\n\nThew, the Brevard County resident who currently has no health care insurance, said cost remains a critical factor for her.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t afford a whole lot. I would be able to pay something. I just can\u2019t pay more than I make every month,\u201d she said.\n\nTHE STORY SO FAR\n\nMedicaid expansion has become a critical issue in the 2015 Legislature. Here is what is happening:\n\n\u2022 Like all states, Florida has the option of expanding Medicaid, the federal-state health care program for the poor and disabled, under the federal Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u2022 With opposition from the House, the Florida Legislature has rejected prior expansion plans.\n\n\u2022 Expansion plans have been revived this spring following the federal government\u2019s announcement that it was likely to end at least part of a $2.2 billion program that funds Florida hospitals for caring for the poor and uninsured.\n\n\u2022 A Senate committee will take up a Medicaid expansion bill (SB 7044) next week. But its ultimate fate rests with the House, where leaders remain opposed to most expansion plans.", "article_metadata": {"wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}, "description": "Medicaid expansion has emerged as a top issue in the 2015 session that began last week.
