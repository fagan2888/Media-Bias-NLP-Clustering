Also, as the tide lowers, the Shoreline flooding will end over the next hour or two. Scattered gusty showers with occasional 30-40+ MPH gusts will continue this afternoon in a far less widespread fashion.\n\n--Mike Cameron\n\n11:15 UPDATE: COASTAL FLOODING, SEVERE T'STORM\n\nA Severe Thunderstorm Warning is in effect until 11:45 in southeastern New London County due to a strong thunderstorm now moving onshore off Fisher's Island. Areas east of Groton/Ledyard/Voluntown may see strong, gusty wind with gusts potentially up to 60 MPH, which is the threshold of wind that starts to be damaging, with the possibility of tree damage and power outages.\n\nA Coastal Flood Advisory is in effect for the Shoreline, mainly west of the Connecticut River, through 1 PM. High tide, coincident with an easterly wind, is responsible for this flooding. Streets and yards that are typically prone to flooding will once again get covered by water.\n\n10 AM UPDATE\n\nBands of heavy rain continue to soak us and will carry on until early afternoon. Waves of downpours with rain rates have been in the 0.5\" to 1.5\" per hour range continue to come with gusty wind. Rain this heavy can cover the street with water, making hydroplaning a real possibility. This intense, steady rain will leave shortly after noon. Once the rain tapes to just scattered showers, we expect warmer air to infiltrate, bringing us highs in the 50s. We still think there is a possibility of setting new record highs today.\n\nThe complete end of the rain showers will happen sometime between 7 PM and 10 PM tonight as a cold front sweeps through the state and a drying west wind follows.\n\n--Mike Cameron\n\n***Previous Discussion***\n\nToday is an EARLY WARNING WEATHER DAY due to rain and gusty wind.\n\nRAINY & WINDY TODAY\n\nToday will be windy and wet. A storm is moving to our west and, at the same time, pushing loads of saturated air into the state. The storm and its path with have several consequences:\n\nRecord warmth is possible. Given this storm\u2019s track west of the state, Connecticut will be on the warm side \u2013 so much so, record high temperatures are possible. A warm front will likely have great success in passing through and to the north of the state, which will allow the warm air to surge north. The record high for the Greater Hartford area for today is 52 degrees, set in 1972 and the record high for Bridgeport is 55 degrees, set in 2000. We think that these will be easily surpassed, as strong southeasterly wind pumps in air that will support middle and upper-50s. Many of the models are suggesting 58 to 59 degrees, which would be record-shattering.\n\nRain will be heavy at times. This storm has a very good draw from the \u201ctap\u201d that is the Gulf of Mexico. Rain become steadier and heavier by late morning. There will be several hours of steady rain late morning and early afternoon. Heavy spells of rain are likely, occasionally with rain coming down at over a half inch and hour. The rain will taper to showers by mid-afternoon and the last showers will leave sometime after 7 or 8 PM. Rain tallies will likely be in the one to two inch range, with some towns receiving more than two inches.\n\nWind gusts could be strong. There will be a lot of wind energy with the storm. Strong south-southeast wind will continue to ramp up as the storm and its strong pressure gradient gets closer. By afternoon, wind will be sustained at 15-25 MPH with gusts that could occasionally go over 40 MPH. Wind at this strength has the capability of bringing small limbs and bigger unhealthy limbs down on power lines, creating isolated power outages.\n\nThunderstorms are possible. There is enough instability forecast to support a few lightning-generating cells. These could also be areas of higher wind gusts, as there will be a better opportunity to transport the stronger winds aloft down to the ground with any downdrafts within thunderstorms.\n\nCoastal flooding is possible. With wind going down the Sound from the east and high tide happening at the same time, minor coastal flooding is possible around midday.\n\nThe air will turn colder as the storm leaves. After the bulk of rain has left, a cold front will move through the state from the Great Lakes, sometime shortly after 7 PM. This from may come with a few more rain showers during the evening. After it passes, the wind will go west and the colder air will come. By morning, the record warmth will be replaced by lows in the 20s by tomorrow morning.\n\nCOLD & DRY MONDAY & TUESDAY\n\nWinter-like weather will make a true blue comeback next week. Monday will be partly sunny and windy with highs in the low and middle-30s. High pressure will be moving closer, which will help to bring the sun. A strong gradient between the departing low and the in-coming high will bring the wind that we expect will be quite strong. Lake-effect snow showers will be on-going in Upstate New York. Although the trajectory on the wind won\u2019t be most favorable for flurries to make their way all the way to Connecticut, a few flurries cannot be completely ruled out.\n\nThe mercury will likely dip into the teens and lower 20s Monday night. The wind will diminish as high pressure passes overhead. Tuesday begin sunny, but some clouds will spread over the state during the afternoon. Daytime highs will be in the 30s. By late afternoon or evening, a few snowflakes will start to tumble down from the sky.\n\nA LITTLE SNOW TUESDAY EVENING - WEDNESDAY\n\nA period of light snow is possible late Tuesday and Wednesday morning. A fast-moving clipper, possibly redeveloping as a coastal storm, would be the root-cause. While this storm doesn\u2019t look like a big one, some accumulation is possible. Some models would lead us to believe we miss out completely on the benefit of coastal redevelopment and only get a few snow showers or flurries. In this scenario, we would get a dusting at most. Other models suggest a richer moisture field, suggesting 1\u201d-3\u201d or even perhaps 2\u201d-5.\u201d So, the details in the accumulations are very much in flux still and require another day\u2019s-worth of model runs to help flush out.\n\nAs the storm departs, a northwesterly wind will get quite gusty Wednesday afternoon and evening. Gusts to 40 MPH or higher are possible. Plus, it will be cold with daytime highs 30-35, a combination that will render wind chill sin the teens at times. The weather will turn even colder overnight as the air temperatures drop through the 20s and into the teens Wednesday night and wind chill readings plunge into the single digits to near zero.\n\nCOLD AND DRY THURSDAY THROUGH SATURDAY\n\nThursday and Friday will be dry and cold with highs in the 20s to near 30 degrees, and lows in the teens. Persistent wind will make it feel even colder. As high pressure moves directly overhead Saturday, the wind will subside, but the cold will stay.\n\nMeteorologist Mike Cameron\n\n\u201cCopyright 2016 WFSB (Meredith Corporation).
