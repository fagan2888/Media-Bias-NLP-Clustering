Mike Huckabee (R-Ark.) said Tuesday that President Obama is more concerned with defending Islam\u2019s reputation than American lives.\n\n\u201cThe No. 1 job of the president is to protect America, not [to] protect the reputation of Islam,\u201d the GOP presidential candidate said on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cSometimes I get the impression that the president is so defensive about the reputation of Islam [that] he forgets that his No. 1 job as commander in chief is to protect this country and eradicate those who are trying to kill us,\u201d Huckabee continued.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about Muslims per se, it\u2019s abut Muslims who are radicalized,\u201d the 2016 GOP presidential candidate added.\n\n\u201cIf Methodists were strapping bombs to their children\u2019s chest and blowing up to kill a bunch of civilians, I\u2019d be saying we need to be real careful about letting Methodists in, too. But I don\u2019t know any Methodists who are doing that.\u201d\n\nObama chastised the GOP\u2019s 2016 presidential field Monday for questioning his plan for resettling approximately 10,000 Syrian refugees next year.\n\nMany Republican White House hopefuls say that strategy is too dangerous, given the potential for terrorist infiltration.\n\n\u201cThe people who are fleeing Syria are the most harmed by terrorism, they are the most vulnerable as a consequence of civil war and strife,\u201d Obama said during the Group of 20 Summit in Antalya, Turkey.\n\nHuckabee countered Tuesday that the president is ignoring the threat posed by groups like the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS).\n\n\u201cThe president acted with such a level of petulance yesterday,\u201d he said. \"His speech was bizarre.\n\n\u201cWhat the president\u2019s suggesting [is] bringing in tens of thousands that are unvetted,\u201d Huckabee said of the Syrian refugees. \"We have no idea who they are [and] we have no idea what their background is.\n\n\u201cI think Americans have a right to be upset,\u201d he added. \"I think people are generally just frustrated the president doesn\u2019t seem to understand that ISIS is a threat to us.\u201d\n\nCriticism of Obama\u2019s refugee resettlement plan is growing following last week\u2019s terrorist attack in Paris that killed 129 people.\n\nReports have emerged suggesting one of the attackers entered Europe with a Syrian passport while posing as an asylum seeker.\n\nHuckabee called on Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) Monday to either halt Obama\u2019s refugee program or resign his new role.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want [Paul Ryan] to be a target, I want him to be a leader,\u201d Huckabee said of his request Tuesday morning.\n\n\u201cPaul Ryan\u2019s the Speaker,\u201d he added. \"He can defund this program [and] he can make sure the purse strings are never unleashed.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "\u201cThe No. 1 job of the president is to protect America,\" he said.", "description": "\u201cThe No. 1 job of the president is to protect America,\" he said.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Ballot Box"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "\u201cThe No. 1 job of the president is to protect America,\" he said.", "title": "Huckabee: Obama would rather defend Islam than Americans", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/260413-huckabee-obama-so-defensive-of-islams-reputation", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/huckabeemike_071815getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-11-17T13:07:53-05:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2015-11-17T13:07-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/260413-huckabee-obama-so-defensive-of-islams-reputation", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2015-11-17T11:37-05:00", "dcterms.creator": "Mark Hensch", "author": "Mark Hensch", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-17T11:37:21-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-17T13:07:53-05:00"}, "keywords": "Islam, refugees, Muslims, Terrorism,Mike Huckabee, Barack Obama,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/260413-huckabee-obama-so-defensive-of-islams-reputation", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "\u201cThe No. 1 job of the president is to protect America,\" he said.", "card": "summary", "title": "Huckabee: Obama would rather defend Islam than Americans"}, "dcterms.title": "Huckabee: Obama would rather defend Islam than Americans"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWhat the president\u2019s suggesting [is] bringing in tens of thousands that are unvetted,\u201d Huckabee said of the Syrian refugees.\nHuckabee countered Tuesday that the president is ignoring the threat posed by groups like the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS).\n1 job as commander in chief is to protect this country and eradicate those who are trying to kill us,\u201d Huckabee continued.\nsaid Tuesday that President Obama is more concerned with defending Islam\u2019s reputation than American lives.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want [Paul Ryan] to be a target, I want him to be a leader,\u201d Huckabee said of his request Tuesday morning."}
