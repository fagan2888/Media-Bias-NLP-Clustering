Until Wednesday it looked like Jeb Bush was going to try to fight Donald Trump while politely letting John Kasich bump him to the back of the pack.\n\nBush\u2019s campaign, of course, bashed Kasich in New Hampshire and continues to do so in South Carolina. But in stump speeches, press appearances, and debates, Jeb has allowed Kasich to poison the Republican well by promoting Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion.\n\nJeb said nothing when Kasich lied about Obamacare expansion at the Jan. 28 debate, and missed another golden opportunity when Kasich \u2014 who expanded Medicaid unilaterally after vetoing a legislative ban on the policy \u2014 griped about executive overreach at the Feb. 6 debate.\n\nAfter Kasich came in second in New Hampshire on Tuesday (finishing with a lower percentage of votes than Jon Huntsman got in 2012), Jeb began emphasizing Kasich\u2019s embrace of Obamacare as proof Jeb\u2019s the more conservative governor.\n\nIn Saturday\u2019s debate, Jeb pounced on Kasich\u2019s reply to a question about his Obamacare expansion:\n\n\u201cExpanding Obamacare is what we\u2019re talking about, and Obamacare\u2019s expansion \u2014 even though the federal government is paying for the great majority of it \u2014 is creating further debt on the backs of our children and grandchildren,\u201d Jeb said.\n\n\u201cWe should be fighting Obamacare, repealing Obamacare, replacing it with something totally different,\u201d Jeb added. Based on Foundation for Government Accountability polling, South Carolina primary voters overwhelmingly oppose Obamacare expansion.\n\nKasich replied as you might expect: by tying himself into an ever-more-bristly knot and then whining about \u201cnegative campaigning.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe knows that I\u2019m not for Obamacare, never have been,\u201d Kasich said. Barely 24 hours before Saturday\u2019s debate, Kasich was sneering at Florida Obamacare opponents during a Fox News interview and at South Carolina Obamacare opponents during a campaign stop.\n\nIn 2013, Kasich vetoed a ban on Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion, expanded Medicaid unilaterally, and threatened to bankrupt Ohio\u2019s entire Medicaid program if lawmakers didn\u2019t appropriate the resulting Obamacare funds. This is all a matter of public record.\n\n\u201cYou know who expanded Medicaid five times, to try to help the folks and give them opportunity so they could rise and get a job? President Ronald Reagan,\u201d Kasich said Saturday night, repeating a talking point former Reagan chief of staff Ed Meese eviscerated more than two years ago.\n\nKasich\u2019s Obamacare expansion covers working-age adults with no kids and no disabilities. The program includes no work requirements.\n\nKasich projected 447,000 Ohioans would enroll in his Obamacare expansion by fiscal year 2020. Average actual enrollment for fiscal year 2016 is 657,000, according to the Ohio Department of Medicaid.\n\nKasich says Obamacare expansion will bring $14 billion of Ohio\u2019s tax dollars back to Ohio in its first seven years. The actual cost in the first two years was $6.4 billion, and that\u2019s new federal deficit spending \u2014 not \u201cOhio money.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe people of this country and this state want to see everybody rise, and they want to see unity, and I don\u2019t want to get into all this fighting tonight \u2019cause the people are frankly sick of the negative campaigning,\u201d Kasich said after Bush pointed to Kasich\u2019s D grade on the latest Cato Institute spending scorecard.\n\nIf South Carolina Republicans were paying attention Saturday night, any of the momentum the media\u2019s favorite Republican has from New Hampshire (#Kasixcitement!) should be stomped out in the state\u2019s Feb. 20 primary.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Bush finally hits Kasich on Obamacare", "title": "Jeb! fights to be Last Governor Standing", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2016/02/14/jeb-fights-to-be-last-governor-standing/", "image": {"secure_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/NY_JtSa7FOQ/0.jpg", "identifier": "http://img.youtube.com/vi/NY_JtSa7FOQ/0.jpg"}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@JazzShaw"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-14T23:31:31+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-14T22:07:15+00:00"}, "keywords": "Jeb Bush, John Kasich, Medicaid expansion, ObamaCare, obamacare expansion,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe032a\"", "article_summary": "If South Carolina Republicans were paying attention Saturday night, any of the momentum the media\u2019s favorite Republican has from New Hampshire (#Kasixcitement!)\nBased on Foundation for Government Accountability polling, South Carolina primary voters overwhelmingly oppose Obamacare expansion.\nBut in stump speeches, press appearances, and debates, Jeb has allowed Kasich to poison the Republican well by promoting Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion.\nSeems like it\u2019s been eons since I was wondering how I\u2019d choose between Bobby Jindal, Scott Walker, and Rick Perry when Ohio\u2019s primary rolled around.\nBush\u2019s campaign, of course, bashed Kasich in New Hampshire and continues to do so in South Carolina."}
