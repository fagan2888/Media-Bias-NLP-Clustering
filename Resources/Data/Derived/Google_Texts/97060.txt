Northern New Jersey was one of five regions targeted by the federal government to increase health insurance enrollment. With the Jan. 31 deadline fast approaching, the pressure to recruit eligible residents, particularly in Newark, has led to a large volunteer effort, bolstered by college students like Krystel Velez.

Velez, a sophomore at Rutgers University – Newark, said she’s spent the last few weeks canvassing the streets of Newark where there are about 70,000 residents without health insurance.

“It’s for a good cause, it’s for helping another, a person, almost like saving a life,” says Velez. “And health insurance is kinda like that.”

She was recruited by a non-profit group called Be Jersey Strong, founded by Aakash Shah, a fourth-year medical student at Harvard and New Jersey native. Shah said he was inspired by his own volunteer efforts three years ago in Alabama when he helped train scores of students who then went on to have over 100,000 conversations with people who needed health insurance.

“I think it was at that point that I realized, well, we might be on to something here,” said Shah. “And I made a mental note to myself to come back home where the need was just as great and do it all over again.”

It hasn’t been easy spreading the word among Newark’s uninsured. People are busy. There are language barriers. The weather certainly hasn’t helped. But even on a day when Velez spoke to just a handful of people whizzing by, or huddled at a bus stop on Broad Street, she felt she made a difference, mentioning one man, a native Spanish speaker, who had questions about insurance Velez could answer.

“I saw it on his face,” she said. “He was like ‘Wow, where did this girl come from.’ It was priceless.”

Many will face a penalty fee of about $700 if they do not find coverage.
