Just ask James and Janet Ramsey, who live near Oceana Naval Air Station in Virginia Beach. Five years ago, the Virginia Department of Transportation took a chunk of their property to build a ramp for Interstate 264.\n\nThis is precisely the sort of public use that eminent domain is meant for, and is perfectly legitimate. What happened next, however, was not. VDOT took the property through a process called quick take, which allows it to assume control of the property immediately and compensate the owners later. It sent out an appraiser, who figured the Ramseys were owed just under a quarter-million dollars.\n\nThe Ramseys thought their property was worth more. As the disagreement headed to court, VDOT sent out a second appraiser, who claimed the property was worth only $92,000. When the case went before a jury, the Ramseys were not allowed to mention the first appraisal at all. Nevertheless, the jury came back with a judgment of $234,000 \u2014 much better than VDOT\u2019s second offer but still shy of its original $248,000 appraisal.\n\nThe Ramseys appealed to the Virginia Supreme Court, which has agreed to hear the case sometime next year (a date hasn\u2019t been set yet). They contend that state evidentiary rules that keep juries in the dark about what the state itself says a piece of property is worth are wrong. They\u2019re certainly right about that.\n\nIf theirs were an isolated case, that would be bad enough. But it isn\u2019t. It\u2019s part of a pattern. Hampton Roads TV station WAVY found plenty of other examples. In one, VDOT\u2019s appraisal went from $210,000 to $17,000. In another, the appraisal went from $214,000 to just $14,000. According to VDOT, this is pure coincidence.\n\nLawyers who represent property owners say that\u2019s bunk. They contend that VDOT is using radically lower second appraisals as a hardball tactic. Owners who do not supinely acquiesce to the first offer will be punished \u2014 severely. It\u2019s evidently a common practice elsewhere, too; in California, they call it sandbagging.\n\nBelieve it or not, the Ramseys are actually fortunate \u2014 compared with some. They didn\u2019t have to vacate their home, which has been in the family for decades. But some owners are evicted outright. When they are, they have to use the money the condemning authority puts in escrow to find another place to live. If they don\u2019t accept the first offer, then when a highway department comes back with a lowball second estimate and demands repayment of the difference, it leaves their victims in a very tight spot.\n\nIt\u2019s been suggested that hammering property owners like this is not bad government but good government. After all, such tactics help save the taxpayers money. That\u2019s a noble goal, but the ends hardly justify the means. To take the argument to absurd extremes, it would save taxpayers money if we did away with criminal trials and simply shot anybody accused of a crime. Fiscal restraint is an important value, but not the only value.\n\nIf you follow politics at all, then you\u2019ve run across the term \u201cgangster government.\u201d For the past few years, it\u2019s been used by conservatives as an epithet to describe the current administration in Washington and its abuses of power generally. But the term is more aptly applied to cases in which agencies shake down ordinary, law-abiding citizens through extortionate policies.\n\nAsset forfeiture provides one example. Sandbagging property owners is another. It\u2019s high time both kinds of highway robbery were brought to a screeching halt.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://reason.com/archives/2014/11/19/how-the-government-steals-from-citizens", "site_name": "Reason.com", "type": "article", "description": "From civil asset forfeiture to eminent domain, the government covets your cash and property.", "title": "How the Government Steals from Citizens"}, "twitter": {"description": "\u201cGovernment,\u201d as Barney Frank and other progressives are fond of\nsaying, \u201cis just another word for things we choose to do together.\u201d\nLike rob people blind.\nSometimes the together-doing is highway robbery in the most\nliteral sense \u2014 as when police departments seize cash from\nmotorists who are never even charged with a crime.
