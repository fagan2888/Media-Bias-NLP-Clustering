Last week, a video of the Walmart parking lot on Front Beach Road went viral due to the chaos. But Saturday night, the parking lot looked different.

The Front Beach Road Walmart parking lot was quiet compared to the scene captured the week earlier.

A Walmart manager told NewsChannel 7, it may be because of less people in the area and an increase in security and police presence in the parking lot.

Panama City Beach Police and Bay County Sheriff's Office spent the night circling the parking lot to keep it free of any more trouble.
