Noting the recent IRS and Obamacare rollout problems, she said, \u201cWe are being told the government can\u2019t handle the technology.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of information coming in and out,\u201d Beckel pushed back. \u201cFor the most part, it works.\u201d\n\nThat set MacCallum off. Transcript of the heated exchange below [emphasis added]:\n\nMACCALLUM: Where does it work, Bob? BECKEL: It works in the IRS. It works fine. MACCALLUM: No, it doesn\u2019t work in the IRS. The IRS just told us that they cannot keep track of their own emails, for God\u2019s sakes. BECKEL: Listen, you take something the size of what the IRS has to put through every year \u2014 hundreds of millions of pieces of data \u2014 and there\u2019s going to be breakdowns. Yes, they could use better technology, so could Obamacare. It will work. MACCALLUM: You\u2019re being an apologist! Do you hear yourself? You are apologizing. We are the greatest nation in the world and we\u2019re supposed to just go, \u201cOh, stuff happens\u201d? BECKEL: Obamacare is working just fine.\n\nThe anchor later confronted Beckel for why he and other Democrats don\u2019t \u201cdemand\u201d that Obamacare work as advertised. \u201cSay this is an embarrassment,\u201d she proposed.\n\nWatch the clip below, via Fox:\n\nPlease enable Javascript to watch.\n\n[h/t Richard Wojcicki]\n\n\u2014 \u2014\n\n>> Follow Andrew Kirell (@AndrewKirell) on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"description": "What was supposed to be a generic left vs. right panel debate during Fox's America's Newsroom turned tense for a few moments as anchor Martha MacCallum berated", "generator": "WordPress 2016.21", "og": {"image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/maccallum.jpg", "title": "\u2018You\u2019re an Apologist!\u2019 Fox\u2019s Martha MacCallum Goes Off on Liberal Guest"}, "twitter": {"description": "What was supposed to be a generic left vs. right panel debate during Fox's America's Newsroom turned tense for a few moments as anchor Martha MacCallum berated her liberal guest, calling him an \"apologist\" for the Obama administration and the Internal Revenue Service over its lost emails controversy.", "creator": "@andrewkirell", "image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/maccallum.jpg", "title": "'You're an Apologist!'
