She is after all the first African-American woman CEO of a Fortune 500 company, a role she took on in 2009. But a new study says she\u2019s one of the worst CEOs in America.\n\n24/7 Wall St. and Glassdoor worked together to rank CEOs based on how well they are liked by their employees and analyze the data. They\u2019ve released a list of nine CEOs with the worst reputations.\n\n\u201cAt nine major companies, 40 percent or fewer employees gave their CEOs a positive review\u201d reports The Huffington Post. Besides Burns, Sears Holdings\u2019 CEO, Edward Lampert, who received positive reviews from just 20 percent of Sears employees and from just 26 percent of Kmart employees, made the list as the lowest-rated CEO.\n\nFor the review, 24/7 Wall St. looked at a variety of factors that can damage a CEO\u2019s reputation within his or her own company. These factors include a CEO\u2019s tendency for publicly embarrassing the company, poor leadership, and a compensation package that employees see as excessive.\n\nTake Abercrombie & Fitch CEO Michael Jeffries who brought shame to his company when he made it seem like his company it had a discriminatory policy toward customers, when he said the clothing company\u2019s target audience were \u201ccool, good-looking people with \u2018washboard stomachs.\u2019\u201d\n\nFor Burns it has been leadership missteps. Her repeated claims that the company\u2019s 2010 $6.4-billion buyout of Affiliated Computer Services would re-energize Xerox\u2019s years of sagging fortunes failed to materialize. \u201cInstead, Xerox\u2019s services business has faltered and revenue flattened. The acquisition\u2019s once-prized assets have barely turned out to be valuable at all,\u201d reports HuffPo. As a result, Burns received a positive review from fewer than one-third of Xerox\u2019s 140,000 employees. Only 30 percent approved of her performance.\n\nThings got really bad late last year, when the company called police before laying off 168 workers at its Cary, N.C., facility, claiming they \u201cwere expecting trouble.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was the second round of a total of roughly 500 layoffs,\u201d reports HuffPo. And while jobs were being cuts, Burns was awarded an average of $13 million annually between 2010 and 2012. Excessive executive bonuses were also the black mark against the three brothers of the Dillard family, the retail giants, were paid a total of more than $58 million between 2011 and 2013.\n\nA lack of concern for employees also hit the reputation of Forever 21\u2019s CEO and founder Do Won Chang. When he slashed employee benefits and switched a number of workers from full-time to part-time status, employees weren\u2019t happy. Many felt the move was made so that the company would have provide fewer workers with health coverage as part of the Affordable Care Act, since only employees working more than 30 hours per week have to be covered.\n\n24/7 Wall St. looked at more than 225 companies with more than 500 comments to find nine CEOs with the lowest favorable reviews \u2014 40 percent or lower.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ursula Burns made history at Xerox, but she's landed on a list of worst CEOs, determined by employee rankings gathered by 24/7 Wall Street and Glassdoor.", "og": {"site_name": "MadameNoire", "description": "Ursula Burns made history at Xerox, but she's landed on a list of worst CEOs, determined by employee rankings gathered by 24/7 Wall Street and Glassdoor.", "title": "Xerox's Ursula Burns Named One Of Worst CEOs In Corporate America", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 378, "identifier": "http://d236bkdxj385sg.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/ursula-burns2.jpg", "height": 413}, "updated_time": "2016-04-11T09:19:46-04:00", "url": "http://madamenoire.com/418058/xeroxs-ursula-burns-named-one-worst-ceos-corporate-america/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://d236bkdxj385sg.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/ursula-burns2.jpg"}, "title": "Xerox's Ursula Burns Named One Of Worst CEOs In Corporate America", "description": "However, the worst is Edward Lampert, CEO of Sears and Kmart.", "card": "summary", "site": "@MadameNoire"}, "robots": "noodp", "ob": {"title": "Xerox's Ursula Burns Named One Of Worst CEOs"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"admins": 100006356380901}, "google-site-verification": "89cYy4uYOnrle-D3H3SPnHJySu32IytBEKjsv1_skZo", "article": {"section": "MN Business", "tag": "xerox", "published_time": "2014-04-08T10:46:14-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-11T09:19:46-04:00"}, "y_key": "637ec967f3cf29ad"}, "article_summary": "Pin this on Pinterest Email this storyUsually Xerox CEO Ursula Burns is praised for her trailblazing role in corporate America.\n24/7 Wall St. and Glassdoor worked together to rank CEOs based on how well they are liked by their employees and analyze the data.\n24/7 Wall St. looked at more than 225 companies with more than 500 comments to find nine CEOs with the lowest favorable reviews \u2014 40 percent or lower.\nAs a result, Burns received a positive review from fewer than one-third of Xerox\u2019s 140,000 employees.\nFor the review, 24/7 Wall St. looked at a variety of factors that can damage a CEO\u2019s reputation within his or her own company."}
