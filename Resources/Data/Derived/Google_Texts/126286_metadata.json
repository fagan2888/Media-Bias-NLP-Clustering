(Photo: MANDEL NGAN, AFP/Getty Images)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama wants YOU to help get more people signed up for Obamacare.\n\nBeginning the third year of open enrollment on the public health insurance exchanges created under the Affordable Care Act, the White House is rolling out a new strategy to boost participation above the elusive 10 million mark.\n\nCalled the \"Healthy Communities Challenge,\" the campaign will target 20 cities with the most uninsured people eligible for marketplace coverage but who haven't signed up. Nationwide, the Department of Health and Human Services estimates there are 10.5 million such people.\n\nObama said Saturday that the city with the most sign-ups will get bragging rights \u2014 and a presidential visit.\n\n\"If you live in one of the 20 cities participating in our Healthy Communities Challenge, I want to see how many of your neighbors you can get signed up,\" Obama said Saturday in his weekly radio address. \"I\u2019ll come visit the city that enrolls the highest percentage of folks who aren\u2019t covered right now. That\u2019s a promise.\"\n\nOpen enrollment for the exchanges began last week. Consumers must sign up by Dec. 15 in order to be beginning Jan. 1, but the White House will consider new sign-ups through the end of open enrollment in January, said White House spokeswoman Katie Hill.\n\nThe White House was scheduled to release details on the \"Healthy Communities Challenge\" on Friday, but delayed the rollout after Obama announced that his administration had denied a permit for the Keystone XL pipeline.\n\nParticipating cities are Atlanta, Milwaukee, Charlotte, Nashville, Chicago, New Orleans, Dallas, Oakland, Calif., Denver, Philadelphia, Detroit, Phoenix, Great Falls, Mont., Richmond, Va., Kansas City, Mo., Salt Lake City, Las Vegas, Seattle, Long Beach, Calif., and Tampa, Fla.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1iJMNse", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "President Obama wants YOU to help get more people signed up\u00a0for Obamacare.", "og": {"site_name": "USA TODAY", "description": "President Obama wants YOU to help get more people signed up\u00a0for Obamacare.", "title": "Obama says he'll visit city with most Obamacare sign-ups", "url": "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/theoval/2015/11/07/obama-says-hell-visit-city-most-obamacare-sign-ups-dec-15/75364606/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "President Obama wants YOU to help get more people signed up\u00a0for Obamacare.", "title": "Obama says he'll visit city with most Obamacare sign-ups", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/82557bcc113bb1c915f5b82592add9d7b2aed3fc/c=544-0-2455-1911&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/11/07/USATODAY/USATODAY/635824960585681851-AFP-517931585-54600305.JPG", "creator": "@usatoday", "site": "@usatoday", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "fb": {"app_id": 215046668549694}, "viewport": "width=1070", "article": {"author": "http://facebook.com/gregorykorte"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Subjects/Public health and safety", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Subjects/Public health and safety", "title": "Obama says he'll visit city with most Obamacare sign-ups", "author": "Gregory Korte", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/politics/theoval", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7d56f792dee94658dcf7e0863d8053d84cb8731c/c=783-0-2216-1911/local/-/media/2015/11/07/USATODAY/USATODAY/635824960585681851-AFP-517931585-54600305.JPG", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2132697899697d0c012c56dee4e50ea6c9677204/c=544-0-2455-1911/local/-/media/2015/11/07/USATODAY/USATODAY/635824960585681851-AFP-517931585-54600305.JPG", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9f321a4f73aa8f14c5a5549ba4f0e71443f6215b/c=229-0-2771-1911/local/-/media/2015/11/07/USATODAY/USATODAY/635824960585681851-AFP-517931585-54600305.JPG", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/dea3b78afdafb1e6d50969736b594a80b72f9f1a/c=0-108-3000-1803&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/11/07/USATODAY/USATODAY/635824960585681851-AFP-517931585-54600305.JPG", "publishtime": "2015-11-07T13:11:22.280000-05:00", "shorthed": "Obama: I'll visit city with most ACA sign-ups", "articleid": 75364606, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7bcb57271ba8a86dc020a815cb3be00653b1312a/c=0-108-3000-1803/local/-/media/2015/11/07/USATODAY/USATODAY/635824960585681851-AFP-517931585-54600305.JPG", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/14dea8a89e959e51d1f1df51a2505c4c05fa4d06/c=965-0-2035-1911/local/-/media/2015/11/07/USATODAY/USATODAY/635824960585681851-AFP-517931585-54600305.JPG"}}, "news_keywords": "Obamacare, Affordable Care Act, I want you, Healthy Communities Challenge, Obama,"}, "article_summary": "Obama said Saturday that the city with the most sign-ups will get bragging rights \u2014 and a presidential visit.\nPresident Obama points to a person viewing his Marine One return on March 5, 2013 on the South Lawn of the White House.\n(Photo: MANDEL NGAN, AFP/Getty Images)WASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama wants YOU to help get more people signed up for Obamacare.\nConsumers must sign up by Dec. 15 in order to be beginning Jan. 1, but the White House will consider new sign-ups through the end of open enrollment in January, said White House spokeswoman Katie Hill.\nCalled the \"Healthy Communities Challenge,\" the campaign will target 20 cities with the most uninsured people eligible for marketplace coverage but who haven't signed up."}
