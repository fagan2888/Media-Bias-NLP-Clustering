More than one-quarter of people diagnosed with HIV lived outside a large urban area, which is the highest percentage of any U.S. region.\n\nWhat makes the Deep South different from the rest of the U.S.?\n\nThe Deep South has lower levels of income, education, and insurance coverage than the rest of the United States. Poverty is consistently associated with poorer health, so it is not surprising that the Deep South is experiencing high death rates among those diagnosed with HIV. And none of the Deep South states have accepted federal dollars to expand their Medicaid programs under the Affordable Care Act, leaving thousands of people in the region without health insurance.\n\nGeography also plays a role in the Southern HIV epidemic. Much of the Deep South HIV epidemic is concentrated outside of large urban areas. The CDC/SASI research found that living outside a large urban area at the time of HIV diagnosis significantly predicted greater death rates among people living with HIV in the region.\n\nHIV-related stigma has been found to be higher outside the large urban areas and transportation is a significant barrier to medical care for HIV-positive individuals living outside urban areas, since most HIV specialty care is located in urban areas. Without reliable transportation, people miss appointments and may lack access to supportive services such as case management, support groups, and legal services.\n\nThanks to advances in HIV treatment, people who are diagnosed with HIV can have normal life expectancies. But that\u2019s only if they get linked to HIV medical care and remain on treatment, which is a challenge in a region where so many people live outside of urban areas, live in poverty, or lack access to health care.\n\nStigma kills\n\nHIV-related stigma has consistently been cited as a driver of the HIV epidemic\u2014especially in the South. In the words of a Deep South focus group participant living with HIV, \u201cHIV doesn\u2019t kill. Stigma kills.\u201d\n\nHIV care providers in the Deep South region tell stories of patients who don\u2019t come to their medical appointments, who won\u2019t participate in support groups, who won\u2019t disclose their HIV status to their closest family members (and the list goes on) because of stigma and a deep fear of how they will be perceived if others discover their status. Stigma also prevents people from getting tested for HIV, which is a critical step in getting the right treatment and in preventing further transmission of the disease.\n\nSouthern laws and policies also contribute to stigma. Most Deep South states have abstinence-based sex education in public schools, which has not been shown to be effective in preventing sexually transmitted infections.\n\nMany Southern states also criminalize HIV-related sexual behaviors and prohibit syringe exchange programs, thus further marginalizing people at high risk for becoming HIV positive, such as sex workers and injection drug users. These laws also discourage HIV testing and make interventions that have proven effective, like syringe exchange, illegal.\n\nOvercoming stigma and promoting prevention\n\nThe drivers of the Southern HIV epidemic are complicated and to a great extent mirror the causes of poor health outcomes overall in southern states. Creative programs, such as the expansion of telemedicine programs and the co-location of HIV care with other services\u2014such as case management and mental health and substance abuse care\u2014are important to overcome stigma and the lack of transportation and medical care in non-urban areas.\n\nFunding to support anti-stigma interventions, including empowerment initiatives for those living with HIV and educational efforts for churches and community, is critical. Finally, increased prevention funding that is directed at urban and rural areas alike is crucial if we are to stem the new HIV diagnosis rates and lower the death rates in the Deep South.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "description": "The Deep South region has become the epicenter of the U.S. HIV epidemic.
