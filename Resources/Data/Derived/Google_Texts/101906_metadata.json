Even a burger.\n\nAnd the penalties can be tough.\n\n\"You can get up to three points on your driver's license for this charge, and a several hundred dollar fine up to a thousand dollar fine,\" said defense attorney Sam Nash. \"As far as your insurance rates, they will increase for at least three years, and they'll always follow you around.\"\n\nNash says the law could even force you to do a year in jail. He says most cops will only cite you for distracted driving if they've spotted some other violation. But he warned that the law is on the books and police can use it.\n\n\"If I got pulled over for doing it, I would accept the responsibility,\" said one driver.\n\nTurner is from Alabama. Police are not saying anything about the case because Turner has not yet appeared in court.", "article_metadata": {"geo.position": "33.899930;-84.564147", "description": "An Alabama man is not \"lovin' it\" after he is pulled over in Georgia for eating a quarter-pounder while driving.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=572089813", "og": {"site_name": "WTVR.com", "description": "An Alabama man is not \u201clovin\u2019 it\u201d after he is pulled over in Georgia for eating a quarter-pounder while driving.", "title": "Police give man ticket for eating burger while driving", "url": "http://wtvr.com/2015/01/19/police-give-man-ticket-for-eating-burger-while-driving/", "image": {"width": 770, "identifier": "https://localtvwtvr.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/burger.jpg", "height": 425}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"app": {"id": {"ipad": 572089813, "iphone": 572089813}}, "creator": "@cbs6", "image": {"src": "https://localtvwtvr.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/burger.jpg?w=640"}, "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@cbs6"}, "keywords": "news, offbeat, crime and justice", "p": {"domain_verify": "fc2caefd8163039c48c3b35b178e0993"}, "fb": {"pages": 6860957425}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "application-name": "WTVR.com", "ICBM": "33.899930, -84.564147", "msvalidate.01": "9CC50DB4C5614EA88B5CFA75E33AAB02", "google-site-verification": "xp-vKfdwBt7bllcG4eSrgb2mL-O45aD7dIeyF4EmMF8", "article": {"publisher": "http://facebook.com/cbs6wtvr", "published_time": "2015-01-20T04:13:35+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-20T04:24:32+00:00", "author": "http://facebook.com/cbs6wtvr"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://wtvr.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/1e5f8555355860d96f4528b85609455b?s=16"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1a18\"", "article_summary": "Many drivers were surprised to hear Cobb County police pulled Turner over and ticketed him for eating a quarter-pounder while driving.\nMadison Turner was given a ticket after getting caught eating a cheeseburger while driving in Cobb County.\n\"I think that's kind of ridiculous,\" said Rahmel Style, another surprised driver.\nHe says most cops will only cite you for distracted driving if they've spotted some other violation.\nWe know it's illegal to text and drive in Georgia, but most drivers had no idea the state's distracted driver law covers anything that takes our attention away from the road."}
