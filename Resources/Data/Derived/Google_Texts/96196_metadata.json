The Rams became the only team to finish the regular season with both a 3,200-yard passer (Garrett Grayson) and a 1,500-yard rusher (Kapri Bibbs).\n\nOn the other hand, Washington State (6-6, 4-5 Pac-12) is directed by Mike Leach, perhaps the nation\u2019s most pass-happy coach. The Cougars average 58 passes per game and threw as many as 89 passes in a game, in a loss to Oregon.\n\nWashington State quarterback Connor Halliday ranks fourth nationally with 4,187 passing yards. He threw 28 touchdowns but also 21 interceptions.\n\nBoth teams have been potent on offense and sometimes inept on defense. Colorado State ranks No. 109 nationally in pass defense, Washington State rates No. 107.\n\nIt will be a surprise if anything but a high-scoring shootout erupts Saturday. This one could resemble a basketball score.\n\nOften in bowl games, at least one of the teams will come out flat. Don\u2019t expect that to occur here. Both teams should be hungry. Colorado State is playing in its first bowl in five years. An even decade has passed since the Cougars last participated in the postseason.\n\nIn the first game of the bowl season, will it be last team with the ball wins?\n\nKickoff is noon with ESPN handling the national telecast.\n\nTom Kensler: tkensler@denverpost.com or twitter.com/tomkensler", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado State, Washington State enter bowl with contrasting styles", "title": "Colorado State, Washington State enter bowl with contrasting styles", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/12/21/colorado-state-washington-state-enter-bowl-with-contrasting-styles/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131221_104748_csu-football.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131221_104748_csu-football.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-21T10:52:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T11:11:20+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8707\"", "article_summary": "ALBUQUERQUE \u2014 There are similarities between Saturday afternoon\u2019s New Mexico Bowl participants Colorado State and Washington State.\nOn the other hand, Washington State (6-6, 4-5 Pac-12) is directed by Mike Leach, perhaps the nation\u2019s most pass-happy coach.\nWashington State quarterback Connor Halliday ranks fourth nationally with 4,187 passing yards.\nUnder coach Jim McElwain, Colorado State (7-6, 5-3 Mountain West) strives for a balanced attack.\nColorado State ranks No."}
