House Bill 439 would give more people access to specialized mental health and veteran courts.\n\nRepresentative Charles McBurney, a Republican from Jacksonville, said House Bill 439 also expands veteran\u2019s courts to probation.\n\n\u201cAnd it also expands the number of persons who would qualify for veterans\u2019 courts,\u201d McBurney said. \u201cAll these programs work together with the ultimate goal of helping the people who need to be helped and reducing recidivism.\u201d\n\nJacksonville Judge Mark Mahon spoke at the committee meeting as well.\n\n\u201cWith so many people with mental health illnesses, the present system is ineffective, expensive and frankly inhumane,\u201d Mahon said.\n\nThe bill has one more committee stop in the Florida House, and a companion bill is moving through the Florida Senate. Central Florida already has a veteran\u2019s court.\n\nReporter Abe Aboraya is part of WMFE in Orlando.
