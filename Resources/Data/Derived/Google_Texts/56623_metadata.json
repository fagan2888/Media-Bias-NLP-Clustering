Antawn Jamison. Dirk Nowitzki. Vince Carter. And Paul Pierce, a first-team all-american out of Kansas who would later have his No. 34 jersey retired by the Jayhawks.\n\nPrior to the draft, Pierce and Kansas teammate Raef LaFrentz worked out for the Nuggets with the hopes of earning that No. 3 selection. The Nuggets went with the 6-foot-11 LaFrentz, a decision that is still deemed one of the worst draft picks in franchise history given the talented players available.\n\n\n\nTo his credit, LaFrentz did well in his three-plus seasons in Denver, despite playing only 12 games his rookie year because of a knee injury. He averaged 13.3 points, 7.7 rebounds and 2.5 blocks per game in his time as a Nugget before being traded, along with Nick Van Exel, to Dallas in 2002.\n\nPierce, meanwhile, was drafted 10th overall by Boston, where he spent 15 seasons, averaged 21.8 points, 6.0 rebounds and 3.8 assists, while earning 10 all-star nods, an NBA championship (2008) and an NBA Finals MVP award.\n\nAt least we\u2019ll always have that photo of him in Nuggets gear.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Nuggets,Paul Pierce", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "Nuggets Ink", "description": "Paul Pierce tried out for the Nuggets prior to the 1998 draft, when Denver had the No. 3 pick.", "title": "Throwback Thursday*: Paul Pierce trying out for Nuggets in 1998", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/2014/10/10/throwback-thursday-paul-pierce-trying-nuggets-1998/11740/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/files/2014/10/pierce-495x482.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Paul Pierce tried out for the Nuggets prior to the 1998 draft, when Denver had the No. 3 pick.", "title": "Throwback Thursday*: Paul Pierce trying out for Nuggets in 1998", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/2014/10/10/throwback-thursday-paul-pierce-trying-nuggets-1998/11740/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/files/2014/10/pierce-495x482.jpg", "creator": "@nickijhabvala", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "language": "en, sv", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Paul Pierce tried out for the Nuggets prior to the 1998 draft, when Denver had the No. 3 pick."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddc52\"", "article_summary": "Prior to the draft, Pierce and Kansas teammate Raef LaFrentz worked out for the Nuggets with the hopes of earning that No.\n3 pick in the draft in 1998, a year when a handful of future star forwards were up for grabs.\nAnd Paul Pierce, a first-team all-american out of Kansas who would later have his No.\nAt least we\u2019ll always have that photo of him in Nuggets gear.\nThe Nuggets went with the 6-foot-11 LaFrentz, a decision that is still deemed one of the worst draft picks in franchise history given the talented players available."}
