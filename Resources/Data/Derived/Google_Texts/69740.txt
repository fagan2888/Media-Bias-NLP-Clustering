The University of West Alabama held their commencement exercises Saturday in Pruitt gymnasium.

There were nearly 500 students who graduated from both undergrad and graduate studies. UWA students as well as the faculty say that the graduation wraps up the year in a very rewarding way.

"Itâ€™s been an excellent year. We're very proud of our graduates. They've attained the knowledge and skills and abilities they need to be successful throughout their lifetime," UWA Pres. Ken Tucker says.

"I feel blessed because not a lot of people can say that they have had a bachelor's degree let alone a masters especially people of my generation," graduate Verdie Coleman III says.
