Social Security will still exist when I reach old age. Social Security will still exist when I reach old age.\u201d (Just to be clear, let\u2019s assume that anthropogenic climate change hasn\u2019t torpedoed the global economy or plunged the United States into a \u201cMad Max\u201d-style post-apocalyptic wasteland when it\u2019s time for us to collect.)\n\nArguably the most successful social program in the history of this great nation, Social Security keeps 22 million older Americans out of poverty, and can easily remain solvent for the foreseeable future. So why are millennials so pessimistic about their chances of getting their fair share when it\u2019s time to collect? In a recent Pew Research poll, only 6 percent of millennials said that they expect to receive a Social Security package comparable to what retirees collect today.\n\nWhile there are a number of explanations for this deep-rooted cynicism, we should look first to the ugly, hysterical state of our political dialogue. It\u2019s perfectly understandable that millennials might crave responsible, measured politicians who are willing to reach above the ugly, partisan fray of our discourse \u2014 indeed, as a candidate, President Obama campaigned on this exact platform, and was summarily rewarded with the largest margin of victory among young voters in a generation.\n\nUnfortunately, the otherwise-reasonable desire for moderation has led to a generation inclined to self-identify as \u201cfiscally conservative, socially liberal.\u201d And, to put it plainly, screw all that noise. Millennials can (and should) celebrate their hard-fought victories in the social sphere: gay marriage, \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell,\u201d and the gradual easing of our disastrous, racist war on drugs are all examples of noteworthy progress. They are also, when taken together, evidence that millennials are gaining political and demographic power, as their political preferences manifest on the national stage with increasing frequency.\n\nBut let\u2019s be very clear: There is no political position more childish than that of the \u201cfiscally conservative, socially liberal\u201d voter. The scourge of the \u201cfiscal conservative, socially liberal\u201d has created a generation that is far too willing to accept a disastrous economic ideology while basking in smug self-satisfaction for having advanced a few token social causes. Unfortunately, true equality for the groups that social liberals want to help will require more than just the legalization of gay marriage, over-the-counter Plan B, or more lax pot laws. Lasting equality for women, minorities and the LGBTQ community requires a progressive tax structure that can afford to pay for strong social programs subsidizing education and keeping things like illness, unplanned pregnancy, or temporary unemployment from permanently holding back the most poor and disenfranchised.\n\nYet according to the gospel of the \u201cfiscal conservative, socially liberal\u201d crowd, welfare programs like Social Security and Medicare are ticking time bombs, and threaten the wider economy. In this narrative, as our society ages, demographic destiny will bring monstrous debt levels, putting us on the same path toward economic stagnation and debt default that has plagued so many of Western Europe\u2019s social democracies.\n\nNo single individual has done more to mislead left-leaning Americans about the impending-crisis of \u201cunfunded liabilities\u201d in healthcare and Social Security as billionaire debt-alarmist Pete Peterson. Financier of the liberal astroturfing outfits \u201cThird Way,\u201d \u201cFix the Debt,\u201d and the deeply misguided \u201cThe Can Kicks Back,\u201d Peterson has engineered a brilliant campaign to create the illusion of an imminent crisis from expanding federal debt. Every poll that show millennials don\u2019t expect Social Security benefits when they eventually retire is evidence of Peterson\u2019s overwhelming success.\n\nPolished and well-financed, Peterson\u2019s groups received scant criticism from the left until fairly recently, successfully sowing the impression of consensus around the impossible \u201cfiscal conservative, socially liberal\u201d position they quietly promote \u2014 yet tellingly, Peterson\u2019s groups hardly ever offer solutions to this impending \u201cdebt crisis\u201d that don\u2019t involve deeply slashing social programs. Peterson\u2019s two-pronged approach is quite simple: summon absurd figures representing our future debt, and combine those ominous numbers with an eager willingness to lump Republicans and Democrats together when parceling out the \u201cblame.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a brilliant piece of political theater \u2014 it appeals to our incipient desire for \u201cabove-the-fray\u201d moderation, while allowing Peterson to effectively disguise the redistributive effects of his proposals as just more bad-tasting medicine that adults surely know they must swallow if they want to get well. In his 2004 bestseller \u201cRunning on Empty\u201d (which earned a glowing Salon review from Farhad Manjoo, who unironically calls the book\u201da tour de force\u201d) Peterson blames both the Democrats and Republicans equally for our current \u201ccrisis.\u201d In Peterson\u2019s mind, the Democrats are to blame for cynically \u2014 irresponsibly? \u2014 buying the votes of the Poors with the promise of cushy handouts like healthcare and elderly support (the nerve!), while the Republicans are to blame for giving sweet tax cuts to their rich benefactors before dealing with the monstrous fiscal burden those conniving liberals created. Frequently referring to federal debt on an \u201cinfinite time horizon,\u201d Peterson borrows an estimate of $45 trillion in unfunded liabilities from the totally\u2013not\u2013biased American Enterprise Institute.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Many young people think Social Security won't exist when they're old.
