Radio 1 in Britain has decided the pop star, 56, is too old for its target listeners and has banned Madonna songs from its playlist.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, it\u2019s all about relevance,\u201d said one Radio 1 insider, the Daily Mail reported. \u201cIt\u2019s natural that as an artist gets older, their audience goes elsewhere, and Radio 1 has to reflect that. The station has duty to meet the needs of younger listeners. I don\u2019t think the audience is losing sleep that it is not playing Madonna in the same way that it used to.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a significant fall from grace for Madonna, who held 13 No. 1 hits in the United Kingdom between 1985 and 2008.\n\nSince December, when her new release \u2014 \u201cLiving for Love\u201d \u2014 made its debut, Madonna\u2019s music has only been played once on the station. Instead, the single has been slated for play on Radio 2 \u2014 the station for the targeted over-35 crowd.\n\nAt the same time, Paul McCartney\u2019s newest single is set for considerable Radio 1 airtime, despite the fact the ex-Beatle is 72 years old.\n\nA station representative said the difference is that Mr. McCartney\u2019s track is done in conjunction with Kanye West, 37, and Rihanna, 26.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Material Girl may have seen her last groove.
