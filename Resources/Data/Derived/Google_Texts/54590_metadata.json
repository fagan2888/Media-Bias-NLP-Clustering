Business leaders and celebrities, such as former NBA star Alonzo Mourning and singer John Legend, will serve on the board.\n\nFormer Secretary of State Colin Powell, Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), former NFL star Jerome Bettis and former NBA all-star Shaquille O'Neal will serve on the advisory board.\n\nSeparately, Johnson announced the White House initiative has secured $500 million in private fundraising commitments to benefit its programs.\n\nThe mission of the White House program and the nonprofit are similar, but the new organization could allow its work to continue after Obama leaves office.\n\nDuring an event with students at the Anacostia Library in Washington, D.C., Thursday, the president hinted at a return to his past community organizing work once he leaves office.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be done being president in a couple of years, and I\u2019ll still be a pretty young man,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so, I\u2019ll go back to doing the kinds of work I was doing before, just trying to find ways to help people.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The president will announce the My Brother's Keeper Alliance in the Bronx.", "description": "The president will announce the My Brother's Keeper Alliance in the Bronx.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Blog Briefing Room"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The president will announce the My Brother's Keeper Alliance in the Bronx.", "title": "Obama to help launch nonprofit aimed at young minority men", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/240909-obama-to-launch-non-profit-aimed-at-young-minority-men", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/obama_immigrationgetty_1.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:39-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/240909-obama-to-launch-non-profit-aimed-at-young-minority-men", "dcterms.date": "2015-05-04T06:00-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Kyle Balluck", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "author": "Jordan Fabian", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,My Brother's Keeper Alliance, My Brother's Keeper", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-04T06:00:05-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/240909-obama-to-launch-non-profit-aimed-at-young-minority-men", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The president will announce the My Brother's Keeper Alliance in the Bronx.", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama to help launch nonprofit aimed at young minority men"}, "dcterms.title": "Obama to help launch nonprofit aimed at young minority men"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc5a8\"", "article_summary": "ADVERTISEMENTThe new organization is related to My Brother's Keeper, a White House initiative aimed at aiding young minority males.\nThe White House has billed the organizations as a reaction to the social ills that have raised tensions between police and minority communities.\nPresident Obama on Monday will announce the creation of a nonprofit group dedicated to helping young men and boys of color.\nSeparately, Johnson announced the White House initiative has secured $500 million in private fundraising commitments to benefit its programs.\n\"The president's My Brother's Keeper Initiative is about recognizing that our young people are not the problem, but rather the solution.\""}
