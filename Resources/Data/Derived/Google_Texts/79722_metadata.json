(AP Photo/Erik Schelzig)\n\nBy Richard Locker\n\nNASHVILLE \u2014 Gov. Bill Haslam appealed to state lawmakers Monday night to approve his Insure Tennessee plan, saying that it\u2019s \u201cnot Obamacare,\u201d that Tennessee taxpayers are paying for it already and that it can help nearly 300,000 uninsured state residents get access to health coverage for at least two years.\n\nAfter addressing one by one the political and financial arguments opponents have advanced against the plan \u2014 a market-oriented hybrid he negotiated with President Barack Obama\u2019s administration as an alternative to the expansion of Medicaid provided in the federal Affordable Care Act \u2014 Haslam asked legislators to look deeper than \u201cthe easy political argument.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think this is also an issue about who we are. My faith doesn\u2019t allow me to walk on the other side of the road and ignore a need that can be met \u2014 particularly in this case, when the need is Tennesseans who have life-threatening situations without access to health care. Particularly when the need can be met like this one can, without cost to our state, with money that our state is currently being taxed for and is sent elsewhere,\u201d the governor told a joint session of the House and Senate in a speech aired live statewide on public television.\n\nThe speech launched a special legislative session that Haslam called for this week to consider the plan.\n\nEarlier Monday, battle lines were drawn when state Sen. Brian Kelsey, R-Germantown, and Rep. Jeremy Durham, R-Franklin, announced that 20 county GOP chairmen had signed a letter opposing the governor\u2019s plan as \u201cObamacare.\u201d\n\nThat followed the release, by advocates of the governor\u2019s plan, of a list of 104 names of Republican activists from across the state, including 17 members of the state GOP executive committee and eight county chairmen, who support the plan.\n\nThe Legislature will begin committee review of Insure Tennessee on Tuesday.\n\nRelated: Insure Tenn. opponents plan protest\n\nIn trying to dispel the argument that the plan is \u201cObamacare,\u201d Haslam said he began working almost two years ago crafting and negotiating an alternative to Medicaid expansion, the ACA\u2019s preferred approach to health coverage.\n\n\u201cIn Tennessee, we took time to evaluate our options to find the right answer for our state. In March of 2013, almost two years ago, I was in this chamber to tell you that Tennessee would not expand our Medicaid program. Expanding a broken system doesn\u2019t make sense.\n\n\u201cBut, I also didn\u2019t think that flat-out saying \u2018no\u2019 to accepting federal dollars that Tennesseans are paying for, that are going to other states, and that could cover more Tennesseans who truly need insurance made much sense either. So we started the work to find a third way, a Tennessee Plan,\u201d Haslam said.\n\n\u201cThis is not Obamacare. If it was, it wouldn\u2019t have taken us this long to negotiate. We have done what you asked us to do and what we said we would do. We found a unique, Tennessee solution.\u201d\n\nRelated: More on Haslam's Insure Tenn. plan\n\nHaslam described the plan as the kind of program Republicans would draft if they were handed the federal dollars otherwise intended to expand Medicaid.\n\nThe plan is a two-year pilot that requires legislative approval to continue past that point. He said the state can end its participation whenever it wants. And the state\u2019s hospitals have agreed to foot the bill for whatever costs the state will incur.\n\nHaslam told lawmakers how the double-pronged plan would work:\n\nThe Volunteer Plan will provide a voucher participants can use to take part in their employer\u2019s health insurance plan, to pay for premiums and other out-of-pocket expenses associated with private market plans.\n\nIn the Healthy Incentives Plan, participants could choose to receive coverage through a redesigned TennCare option with healthy incentives accounts modeled after health reimbursement accounts and which could be used to pay a portion of the required cost sharing.\n\nReaction to the governor\u2019s 15-minute speech itself was generally positive.\n\n\u201cI think the governor made the case that this is not pure Obamacare. I think he answered questions that are being raised,\u201d said Rep. John DeBerry, D-Memphis.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Gerald McCormick, R-Chattanooga, said it \u201cwas good that he brought the human element\u201d into the speech. \u201cHe spoke to the heart. I thought it was the best speech I\u2019ve heard him make. So we\u2019ll see if it helps affect the votes and hopefully we\u2019ll know in the next couple of days.\u201d\n\nHouse Republican Caucus Chairman Glen Casada of Franklin said: \u201cThe governor has got his work cut out for him. He\u2019s going to have to convince 50 out of 99 and he\u2019s not there today.\"", "article_metadata": {"title": "Haslam: Insure Tennessee is not Obamacare", "og": {"url": "http://www.knoxnews.com/news/state/haslam-insure-tennessee-is-not-obamacare-ep-912092711-353602961.html", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/medicaid_tennessee.jpeg-0b23f_1422926650810_13031109_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "height": 427}, "type": "article", "description": "NASHVILLE \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Gov.
