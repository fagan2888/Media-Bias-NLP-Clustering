Elizabeth Lauten will be resigning as Tennessee Republican Congressman Steve Fincher’s communications director following a Facebook post in which she took aim President Obama’s daughters, Sasha & Malia who looked less than amused when present when their father pardoned a turkey on Thanksgiving Day.

Lauten admonished the Obama girls to show “a little class”. She also wrote “Dress like you deserve respect, not a spot at a bar.” She would subsequently delete the Facebook post and issue an apology, but it wasn’t enough to save her job. I do suspect this wouldn’t be the case if a Democratic congressional staffer had criticized the children of a Republican President in this manner. Nevertheless, I think Lauten did a foolish thing.

Now it’s true that people were commenting on Sasha & Malia’s body language on social media, but they were doing so in a humorous manner. A lot of people can relate to Dads who embarass their teenaged daughters and to teenaged daughters who are embarrassed by their Dad, even if their Dad is President of the United States. I know a lot of conservatives are annoyed with Obama’s overexposure. But in some ways we’re lucky. We don’t have to live with him. So the scene itself is worthy of commentary. But it’s one thing to do that, but quite another to throw a brushback pitch at the Obama girls and suggest they were dressed up to go to a bar.

Given how President Obama has acted concerning Obamacare, immigration, Israel, ISIS, Ebola and a litany of other things there is so much for which he richly deserves to be criticized. However, the same cannot be said for Sasha & Malia Obama. As demonstrated by their body language they didn’t want to be there. After they didn’t choose this life. If they pursue public life as adults then that’s a different matter. But for now we should leave them alone. Yes, they are President Obama’s children, but they are still children nevertheless.
