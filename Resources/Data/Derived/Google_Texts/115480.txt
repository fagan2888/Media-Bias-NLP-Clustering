Health care has become almost as contentious in the Democratic primary as it has been for the last several years between Democrats and Republicans in Washington. It became the first point of tension between Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton on Thursday night.

Mrs. Clinton is eager to cast her rival as willing to push aside President Obama’s Affordable Care Act while he seeks a single-payer plan similar to those in many European nations. In the first few minutes, she went on the attack. “I am not going to wait and have us plunge back into a contentious national debate that has very little chance of succeeding,” she said.

Mr. Sanders quickly took offense, saying that “it is just not accurate” that he would dismantle the current health care system while he tries to put in place something better. He praised Obamacare but said it had not done enough to deal with 29 million people without insurance.
