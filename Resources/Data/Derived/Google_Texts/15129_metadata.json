Act to provide funds to farmers to help them market their crops \u2013 authority Congress took away from the secretary under unusual circumstances in 2010.\n\nVilsack floated that possibility when he testified before a hearing of the House Agriculture Committee two weeks ago, and he repeated his willingness to do it again when he spoke to several thousand corn, soybean, grain sorghum and wheat farmers attending Commodity Classic in New Orleans today (March 4).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s obvious to us we don\u2019t have the statutory authority to designate cottonseed as an other oilseed,\u201d Vilsack said, responding to a question raised about the issue during a press briefing that followed his speech in New Orleans.\n\nDelta Farm Press Daily Stay current on what\u2019s happening in Mid-South agriculture: Subscribe to Delta Farm Press Daily.\n\n\u201cHaving said that, we want to help,\u201d he added. \u201cThere are two ways we could help, one of which has been shut off by Congress. We could use the Commodity Credit Corp.\u2019s resources to provide some kind of payment program similar to the transition program that was in place for 2014 and 2015 for cotton growers.\u201d\n\nCongress specifically prohibited the Agriculture Department from using those funds, reportedly, because of charges USDA used such a program to try to help Arkansas Sen.
