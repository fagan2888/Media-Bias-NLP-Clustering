1. Good Sam is now part of a new regional health network formed by the merger of 11 Alegent Creighton Health institutions in Nebraska and Iowa, and five Catholic Health Initiatives hospitals in Nebraska.

2. The sole Kearney representative on the board is attorney Larry Butler, who served on the now-defunct CHI Nebraska Board of Directors.

3. The new organization’s working title is “The Network.” By early next year, its board will have 15 members; so far, 11 have been named.

4. The network will name a CEO in 2014, when the current chairs of ACH and CHI retire.

5. By late September, the Good Samaritan Hospital board of trustees will become an advisory board only.

6. While unlikely, Good Sam could get a new name in 2014 after market research, now under way, is completed.
