Teams have gathered in the continuing thunderstorms and rain.\n\nBishop says the tornado outbreak at this time of the year for North Texas occurs \"from time to time ... but it's certainly not something that happens regularly.\"\n\nIn far West Texas, up to four inches of snow has fallen overnight in the Alpine area, with foot-deep drifts reported.\n\n7:35 a.m.\n\nGarland Police Lt. Pedro Barineau said at least three people who died were found in vehicles.\n\nHe also said that some cars appeared to be thrown from Interstate 30 and George Bush Turnpike when the tornado hit about 6:45 p.m. Saturday.

She posted on twitter: \"We have destroyed and damaged homes. Please do not get out on the roads if you do not have to.\"\n\nThe National Weather Service in Fort Worth confirmed that a tornado touched down south of Dallas earlier this evening.

Robert Bentley praised efforts to restore and improve the levee system while touring the town of Elba, which was affected by flooding.\n\nBentley visited the town in southern Alabama on Saturday and stopped in at Elba Elementary, where people had taken shelter from the flood waters. He says the levees are expected to withstand the river crest.\n\nThe tiny, flood-prone Alabama town was underwater in 1929, which led to the constructions of levees for protection. The city flooded again in 1990 when rising waters overwhelmed levees and again in 1998 when a levee failed under pressure from flood waters.\n\nBentley declared a state of emergency Friday amid widespread flash flooding that follows several days of intense weather throughout the Southeast.\n\n1:30 p.m.\n\nMississippi's death toll from this week's storms has climbed to 10.\n\nMississippi Emergency Management Agency spokesman Greg Flynn confirms two bodies were found Saturday morning in Benton County.

A total of 17 people have been killed.\n\n1 p.m.\n\nVolunteers are distributing sandbags in the town of Elba, Alabama, as flooding remained a major concern after severe storms battered the state.\n\nJames Brown of the Coffee County Emergency Management Agency says volunteers distributed sandbags in Elba, where the Pea River was projected to crest Saturday at 43 feet, about a foot below the levees that protect the area.\n\nBrown says while that height was much too for much comfort, so far the levees were holding.\n\nEmergency officials issued a voluntary evacuation order for the flood-prone community.\n\nAbout 17 people took safety in a county shelter. Brown said that, according to estimates, more than 100 structures appear to have water damage.\n\nGov. Robert Bentley will tour the area later in the day.\n\n11:30 a.m.\n\nAlabama Gov. Robert Bentley will tour areas in his state damaged by floods a day after declaring a state of emergency in all counties affected by excessive rain.\n\nThe governor's office said in a statement that nearly 200 roads in the state are closed due to flooding.\n\nBentley will visit, among other places, Elba Elementary School, where dozens of flood victims took shelter Friday night.\n\nUnseasonably warm temperatures across the southeastern U.S. this week spawned severe weather blamed for deaths in Mississippi, Alabama and Arkansas. A total of 15 people were killed.\n\n9:20 a.m.\n\nThe Texas and Oklahoma Panhandles are bracing for what National Weather Service forecasters are calling a \"historic blizzard.\"\n\nBetween 6 to 15 inches of snow are in the forecast for the region, which includes Amarillo and Lubbock. High winds will drive wind chills as low as 10 below zero and cause low visibility due to blowing and drifting snow.\n\nThe blizzard warning for the region takes effect at 6 p.m. Saturday and runs through noon Monday.\n\nOther parts of Texas and Oklahoma, including El Paso, are under winter storm warnings, while North Texas, central Oklahoma and central Kansas are under a winter storm watch.\n\nWidespread rain has prompted flash flood watches in eastern Texas, eastern Oklahoma, most of Arkansas, central and southern Missouri and Illinois and central Indiana.\n\n9:45 a.m.\n\nThe National Weather Service has issued flood warnings for parts of northern Alabama following days of heavy rain and severe weather.\n\nThe NWS says moderate flooding is occurring and major flooding is forecast for Big Nance Creek, which runs through the town of Courtland in northern Alabama. The area is about 40 miles east of Huntsville. The creek is not expected to fall below flood stage until early Monday.\n\nA flood warning was also in effect for the Coosa River, swollen by up to 8 inches of rain over the past week. The biggest town threatened by the rise in the Coosa is Gadsden in northeastern Alabama.\n\nThe NWS is warning drivers to stay off roads in areas where flooding is expected.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "A southern Illinois coroner says three adults and two children have drowned after the vehicle they were riding in was swept away and sank in a rain-swollen creek.", "language": "english", "author": "Associated Press", "og": {"url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Dallas-under-tornado-warning-363564121.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/garland+texas+tornado.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A southern Illinois coroner says three adults and two children have drowned after the vehicle they were riding in was swept away and sank in a rain-swollen creek.", "title": "UPDATE: 5 people die in flash flood in Illinois"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "A southern Illinois coroner says three adults and two children have drowned after the vehicle they were riding in was swept away and sank in a rain-swollen creek.", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Dallas-under-tornado-warning-363564121.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/garland+texas+tornado.jpg", "title": "UPDATE: 5 people die in flash flood in Illinois", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "UPDATE: 5 people die in flash flood in Illinois", "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "UPDATE 5 people die in"}, "article_summary": "The National Weather Service has issued flood warnings for parts of northern Alabama following days of heavy rain and severe weather.\nWidespread rain has prompted flash flood watches in eastern Texas, eastern Oklahoma, most of Arkansas, central and southern Missouri and Illinois and central Indiana.\nNational Weather Service meteorologist Matt Bishop said Sunday that more rain and plunging temperatures are on the way.\nThe National Weather Service says it is expecting historic snowfall totals and that snow drifts more than 7 feet high have been reported.\nhe National Weather Service says the river had exceeded a flood stage of 25 feet to 33.5 feet by 8 a.m. Saturday."}
