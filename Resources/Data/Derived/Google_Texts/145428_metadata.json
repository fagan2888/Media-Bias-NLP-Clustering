FARC has stated that the ceasefire suspension was the result of five months of land and air offensives against their structures.\n\n\"We deplore the joint attack by the air force, the army and the police,\" FARC said in a statement. \u201cWe feel pain for the deaths of guerrilla fighters as well as soldiers, sons of a same people and from poor families.\"\n\nFARC seems to reluctantly be willing to go on with the latest round of peace talks in Havana: \"Against our will we will proceed with the [peace] talks in the middle of a confrontation.\"\n\nThe rebel group\u2019s prowess and staying power is a quality much coveted by other groups, be they communist or cartel-oriented.\n\nAccording to In Sight Crime, two U.S. intelligence officers recently told a Mexican newspaper that members of the Jalisco Cartel were in fact trained by the Colombian rebels.\n\nOne of the unidentified government officials said, \"The reports we obtained in Colombia show various bosses of the Jalisco Cartel, New Generation and Los Cuinis were trained by the FARC in assault tactics [to be used against] members of the military.\"", "article_metadata": {"Description": "After 26 Farc fighters were killed in a Colombian air and ground offensive this past Thursday, the Marxist group has suspended a unilateral ceasefire which had been put in place since December 2014.", "Copyright": "2016 Latin Post", "Author": "Latin Post", "og": {"site_name": "Latin Post", "description": "After 26 Farc fighters were killed in a Colombian air and ground offensive this past Thursday, the Marxist group has suspended a unilateral ceasefire which had been put in place since December 2014.", "title": "FARC Suspends Truce After Colombia Attacks", "url": "http://www.latinpost.com/articles/55206/20150524/farc-suspends-truce-colombia-attacks-fighters.htm", "image": "http://images.latinpost.com/data/images/full/36369/farc-colombian-solder.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "latinpost.com", "description": "After 26 Farc fighters were killed in a Colombian air and ground offensive this past Thursday, the Marxist group has suspended a unilateral ceasefire which had been put in place since December 2014.", "title": "FARC Suspends Truce After Colombia Attacks", "url": "http://www.latinpost.com/articles/55206/20150524/farc-suspends-truce-colombia-attacks-fighters.htm", "image": "http://images.latinpost.com/data/images/full/36369/farc-colombian-solder.jpg", "creator": "@latinpost", "site": "@latinpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "syndication-source": "http://www.latinpost.com/articles/55206/20150524/farc-suspends-truce-colombia-attacks-fighters.htm", "robots": "index, follow", "p": {"domain_verify": "35e478f7510504ec71abd594218dee4e"}, "Title": "Latin Post", "Googlebot-News": "index, follow", "Keywords": "Latin Post", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-24"}, "news_keywords": "farc, suspends, truce, colombia, attacks, fighters", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "Subject": "Latin Post"}, "article_summary": "FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia; in English: Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) has asserted that they are not letting go of the peace talks, which have been taking place in Havana.\nFARC seems to reluctantly be willing to go on with the latest round of peace talks in Havana: \"Against our will we will proceed with the [peace] talks in the middle of a confrontation.\"\n\"We deplore the joint attack by the air force, the army and the police,\" FARC said in a statement.\nFARC has stated that the ceasefire suspension was the result of five months of land and air offensives against their structures.\nLast week's attack, which took place in Colombia\u2019s southwestern Cauca region, was the deadliest attack to have occurred since the air strikes against FARC resumed last month."}
