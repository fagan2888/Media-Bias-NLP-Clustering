Their shared Cuban roots played a big role. Gutierrez was one of 14,000 children who came to this country as exiles in 1962. Leaving barbaric conditions, shipped to New York, the young Gutierrez made his way to Paterson, where he lived before moving to Toms River.\n\nSince their first meeting, Rubio and Gutierrez have kept contact with each other. Gutierrez did another fundraiser for Rubio in 2010, and the senator calls his friend routinely. Last December he notified Gutierrez that he planned to run for president in 2016.\n\nA proud Republican, Gutierrez has supported two Democrats over the years: U.S. Senator Bob Menendez (D-NJ) and U.S. Rep. Albio Sires (D-8). That financial support for his fellow Cuban Americans continued until the two Democrats voted for Obamacare. Then he withdrew his support for their political campaigns. Gutierrez, however, out of loyalty and friendship, has donated to Menendez\u2019s defense fund.\n\n\u201cObama comes from Chicago,\u201d said Gutierrez. \u201cHe\u2019s a vicious politician. There\u2019s no doubt in my mind that what Bob [Menendez] is going through is a consequence of political payback. Bob is a progressive guy on domestic issues, but he\u2019s more conservative on foreign policy, and I think Obama knew Bob would stand in the way of policy initiatives on Iran and Cuba, and so\u2026\u201d\n\nMenendez was indicted on corruption charges earlier this year.\n\n\u201cBob will survive it,\u201d Gutierrez said.\n\nIn the meantime, the GOP fundraiser focuses on Rubio. \u201cWe\u2019re three weeks away from the Aug. 13th fundraiser,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have 70 people now and I think we will have over 100.\u201d\n\nA former mayor of Colts Neck is among those committed to attending the event.\n\nConvinced of Rubio\u2019s communications skills, leadership ability, intelligence and commitment to the country, the presidential candidate also has undeniable charisma, Gutierrez argues. \u201cOn that level at this point you need to be Hollywood,\u201d he said.\n\nAs for his organizing in a state institutionally mostly dominated (with at least one other exception) by Gov. Chris Christie, Gutierrez said it\u2019s nothing personal. \u201cI like Chris,\u201d he said of the governor. \u201cBut Marco is my candidate.\u201d\n\nAs for Rubio possibly getting politically tangled up with fellow Floridian former Governor Jeb Bush, Gutierrez said he talked to the senator about that and Rubio told him he won\u2019t attack Bush. The two men will keep their discourse civil.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "https://nyopolitickernj.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/merc.jpg?w=50", "description": "For Rubio Backer Gutierrez, it's about Loyalty - including His Support for Menendez", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "New Jersey News, Politics, Opinion, and Analysis", "description": "For Rubio Backer Gutierrez, it\u2019s about Loyalty \u2013 including His Support for Menendez", "title": "For Rubio Backer Gutierrez, it\u2019s about Loyalty \u2013 including His Support for Menendez", "url": "http://politickernj.com/2015/07/for-rubio-backer-gutierrez-its-about-loyalty-including-his-support-for-menendez/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "https://nyopolitickernj.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/merc.jpg?w=1200", "height": 800}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://nyopolitickernj.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/merc.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "@PolitickerNJ", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@PolitickerNJ"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-07-24 16:00:47", "sailthru.title": "For Rubio Backer Gutierrez, it\u2019s about Loyalty \u2013 including His Support for Menendez", "fb": {"app_id": 710865528969413}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://politickernj.com/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico", "application-name": "New Jersey News, Politics, Opinion, and Analysis", "keywords": "bob menendez, marco rubio", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PolitickerNJ", "published_time": "2015-07-24T20:00:47+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-24T20:08:43+00:00", "author": "http://wordpress.com/author/max"}, "sailthru.description": "For Rubio Backer Gutierrez, it's about Loyalty - including His Support for Menendez", "sailthru.image.full": "https://nyopolitickernj.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/merc.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0", "news_keywords": "Bob Menendez, Marco Rubio"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce9bd\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI met Marco Rubio 10-12 years ago when he was a state representative in Florida,\u201d Gutierrez, a Cuban immigrant, told PolitickerNJ.\nSenator Bob Menendez (D-NJ) and U.S. Rep.
