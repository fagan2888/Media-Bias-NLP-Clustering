The owner of Roundkick Gym in Urbandale and Carroll, Pete Peterson, attempted the world record for most burpees in one day.

Peterson had to do more than 10,110 in 24 hours in order to be the new world record holder.

However, after burpee number 8,115, his body gave out.

Peterson said his lofty goal wasn't about trying to make it into the record books. He wanted to raise money for healthy snacks for kids at the Boys and Girls Club of Iowa.

"They provide a lot of nutrition for kids and give them the education on how to eat more healthy," Peterson said. "They work with the parents of the kids, it’s a big cause. I think people overlook that, and if we get kids healthy, that changes lives.”
