A few hours before he is sworn in for a second term, Gov. Dannel P. Malloy administered the oath of office to Nancy Wyman, whom he called "the best lieutenant governor in America."

"She is a true partner for me,'' Malloy said Wednesday morning in the state Senate chamber. He cited Wyman's work helping to implement the Affordable Care Act in Connecticut, as well as her work with veterans.

"Over the past four years, we've faced very difficult times together,'' Wyman said. She said Malloy is living up to his mother's invocation to "leave the world a better place for your having been in it."
