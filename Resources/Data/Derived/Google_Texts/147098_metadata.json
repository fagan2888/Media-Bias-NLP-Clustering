If anything, it says young MacKinnon is not comfortable challenging men in one-on-one battles in which he should win.\n\nBut MacKinnon \u2014 perhaps the NHL\u2019s most powerful skater \u2014 promises to be more aggressive in his third year as the Avalanche\u2019s electrifying offensive star.\n\n\u201cThat was just a habit, I think. There\u2019s times to pull up and times to drive, and obviously I didn\u2019t drive enough. I know that,\u201d said MacKinnon, the 2014 Calder Trophy winner who is coming off a disappointing second season. \u201cBut you have to make a decision pretty quick out there and sometimes you\u2019re not going to make the best decision. I can drive more, for sure, and I need to get deeper when I do pull up \u2014 it needs to be closer to the goal line. I have to at least try to get to the net, and if I can\u2019t, I\u2019ll pull up. But for sure, this year I\u2019m going to try to be more aggressive.\u201d\n\nMacKinnon, who turned 20 on Sept. 1, is better equipped to compete this season. He is a quarter-inch taller, up to nearly 6-foot-1, and he gained 15 pounds, up to about 210.\n\nHe\u2019s even faster.\n\n\u201cI feel faster, more powerful. I can say all that stuff, but I have to bring it to the games. But I do feel good out there,\u201d he said.\n\nMacKinnon knows he still has plenty of growth \u2014 because he continues to grow. His new beard is proof. He couldn\u2019t grow more than a peach-fuzz playoff beard as an 18-year-old in 2014.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m young and growing, still filling in my body. I don\u2019t know how heavy I\u2019ll be. Still trying to figure that out,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m in good shape and whatever weight I am, as long as I feel light on the ice I should be OK.\u201d\n\nMacKinnon was drafted as a center, played wing most of his rookie season and was back at center early last season \u2014 until the coaching staff realized he had too much responsibility on his plate.\n\nThis season, he is pegged to start at right wing with center Carl Soderberg and left wing Gabe Landeskog.\n\nUltimately, your most gifted forwards with elite speed play center.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see how it shakes out,\u201d MacKinnon said.\n\nIn looking back to his sensational rookie season and his sophomore slump \u2014 which ended in January when he fractured his foot \u2014 the difference was confidence. Like the Avs as a team, they were a confident bunch in 2013-14 and lost that belief last season.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not exactly one thing I didn\u2019t do my second year that I did my first year. I was probably a better hockey player my second year, in terms of my skill set and skating,\u201d MacKinnon said. \u201cMy mind-set was obviously not as good. I wasn\u2019t as confident and having as much fun. Those things definitely affect your play.\u201d\n\nMatt Duchene, 24, has been there. He could write a book about the ebbs and flows of an 18-year-old becoming a man against men in the NHL. Duchene, Landeskog and MacKinnon began their careers at 18 and never played in the minors.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019ll bounce back,\u201d Duchene said of MacKinnon. \u201cFor me, when I went through that, you have to ask yourself tough questions and you have to reflect the right way. You can\u2019t kid yourself.\n\n\u201cYou have to look in the mirror and be realistic. Obviously, he had such a great first year. You\u2019re not going to fix what\u2019s not broken. But when you address the things that went wrong, and do it the right way, there\u2019s no way a player of his caliber can\u2019t succeed, and won\u2019t succeed.\n\n\u201cI have nothing but confidence that he\u2019s going to have an amazing year.\u201d\n\nMike Chambers: mchambers@denverpost.com or @mikechambers", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Nathan MacKinnon on a mission to be more aggressive for Avalanche", "title": "Nathan MacKinnon on a mission to be more aggressive for Avalanche", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/09/26/nathan-mackinnon-on-a-mission-to-be-more-aggressive-for-avalanche/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150926__BN20150927_CC16_BNSP27HKNAVSp1.jpg", "height": 498}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150926__BN20150927_CC16_BNSP27HKNAVSp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-26T17:28:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T22:10:09+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe318d\"", "article_summary": "I know that,\u201d said MacKinnon, the 2014 Calder Trophy winner who is coming off a disappointing second season.\n\u201cFor me, when I went through that, you have to ask yourself tough questions and you have to reflect the right way.\nThis season, he is pegged to start at right wing with center Carl Soderberg and left wing Gabe Landeskog.\nIn a one-on-one situation with a defenseman, two things typically happen when Nathan MacKinnon takes the puck wide and drives to the net.\nBut MacKinnon \u2014 perhaps the NHL\u2019s most powerful skater \u2014 promises to be more aggressive in his third year as the Avalanche\u2019s electrifying offensive star."}
