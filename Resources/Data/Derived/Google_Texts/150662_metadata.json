It goes beyond addressing climate change; it goes to the health of our children today.\n\n\"One in four kids has asthma, autism, ADHD or allergies - linked to how we use fossil fuels and petrochemicals\" said Reverend Mitch Hescox, CEO of the Evangelical Environmental Network. Full disclosure: I'm on their Board of Directors.\n\nA record 365 companies and investor groups have announced support for the EPA's Clean Power Plan, including General Mills and Aveda. They believe we can find clean, carbon-free ways to power up the economy and keep people working.\n\nThere are viable, cost-effective alternatives to \"drill baby drill\". We didn't leave the Stone Age because we ran out of stones. We exited the Stone Age because we found a better way forward.\n\nWelcome to September. A remarkably persistent northwest wind flow aloft ushers in a taste of mid-September this week with a streak of 70s. The heatwave gripping much of America will remain well south of Minnesota.\n\nWe may see a little smoke from western wildfires but Heat Index won't get much traction here for at least the next 2 weeks.\n\nNon-Polluting Growth. Ceres has more on the Clean Power Plan; here's an excerpt: \"In an unprecedented show of business support for tackling climate change, 365 companies and investors sent letters to more than two-dozen governors across the United States voicing support for the EPA Clean Power Plan for existing power plants and encouraging the states\u2019 \u201ctimely finalization\u201d of state implementation plans to meet the new standards...\"\n\nExpert Analysis Finds That The Clean Power Plan Is Not A Threat To Midwestern Power Grid Reliability. Here is the intro to a J. Drake Hamilton analysis at Fresh Energy: \"Working toward an electricity system that aggressively lowers carbon pollution requires a well-operated regional power grid for success. Today\u2019s interconnected electric power grid is reliable, affordable, and increasingly carries clean electricity. Tomorrow\u2019s integrated electric grid must be cleaner still, as well as reliable and affordable. The emerging modern, efficient power grid must be designed and operated to reduce environmental impacts, including allowing Minnesota and its neighbors to comply with the nation\u2019s first (and long overdue) limits on carbon pollution from our existing coal-burning power plants; these standards, to be finalized this summer, are known as the Clean Power Plan...\"\n\nObama Unveils Major Climate Change Proposal Today. Here's an excerpt of a summary at CNN.com: \"...The plan will call for a reduction power-sector carbon pollution of 32% from 2005 levels in 2030 -- a 9% increase over the 2014 draft proposal, the official said. It will also call for a more aggressive transition to renewable energy. \"Power plants are the single biggest source of harmful carbon pollution that contributes to climate change,\" Obama said in the video. \"Until now, there have been no federal limits to the amount of carbon pollution plants dump in the air...\"\n\nThe Dangers of Mercury Poisoning. Even if you don't care one whiff about man-made climate change, weather and water volatility or the implications for your kids and grandkids, you should be aware of the side effects of fossil-fuel generated power; specifically mercury poisoning downwind of these plants. Taller stacks have turned this from a local into a regional issue and scrubbers can't catch all the carcinogenic pollutants released. There's only so much you can do to clean up inherently dirty fossil fuels. Here's an excerpt from EEN, The Evangelical Environmental Network that caught my eye: \"Mercury emitted from power plants drops from air to earth and presently contaminates over 6 million acres of freshwater lakes, 46,000 miles of streams, and 225,000 wetland acres across the U.S. Every state has a fish consumption advisory. Mercury contaminated fish are often eaten by pregnant women. Mercury and other heavy metal toxins pass across the mother\u2019s placenta and enter the bloodstream of her unborn child. A protective shield around the developing child\u2019s brain is not fully formed until the first year of life. Mercury easily crosses into the developing child\u2019s brain causing brain damage, developmental disabilities, neurological disorders, lowered intelligence, and learning difficulties...\"\n\nPersistent Kink in the Jet Stream. The \"ridiculously resilient ridge\" out west is, in turn, treating the north central USA, Great Lakes and New England to more of a Canadian breeze with frequent outbreaks of cooler, drier, more comfortable air over the northern tier of the USA (east of the Rockies). This trend should continue into the first half of August. The map above shows 250 mb winds today, as predicted by the GFS, courtesy of Climate Reanalyzer.\n\nComfortable and (Relatively) Dry Week Shaping Up. NOAA's 84-hour NAM guidance shows the heaviest showers and T-storms staying south and west of Minnesota into Thursday morning. The best chance of some rain may come Thursday PM into Friday, with partial clearing in time for next weekend. Stay tuned.\n\n7-Day Rainfall Potential. The best chance of heavy rain looking out the next week or so comes from Kansas City and St. Louis across the Ohio Valley into southern New England, where some 2-4\" amounts are possible. More heavy rain is likely from Tampa to the Outer Banks, although the risk of tropical formation in the next 7-10 days is low.\n\nWhat August? Are you sure it's not September 3 - did I sleep through the entire month of August? Hate it when that happens. Expect a very comfortable week with winds easing up a bit by Tuesday; the best chance of showers and a few T-showers late Thursday into Friday as surface winds peak. More showers may slosh into town late Sunday - right now Saturday appears to be the nicer outdoor day of the weekend.\n\nFaint Whiffs of Warmth. GFS guidance is hinting at a few blips of 90-degree heat by mid-August, but there's little doubt the core of heat and beastly humidity will stay to our south and west, a persistent heat dome over the southern 2/3rds of America, with the worst heat out west where more records may fall. 500 mb wind forecast (GFS) valid the evening of August 16 courtesy of GrADS:COLA/IGES.\n\nIran City Hits Suffocating Heat Index of 165 Degrees, Near World Record. Pretty typical.....for the surface of Venus. Meteorologist Jason Samenow has the amazing details at Capital Weather Gang; here's an excerpt: \"...In the city of Bandar Mahshahr (population of about 110,000 as of 2010), the air felt like a searing 165 degrees (74 Celsius) today factoring in the humidity. Although there are no official records of heat indices, this is second highest level we have ever seen reported. To achieve today\u2019s astronomical heat index level of 165, Bandar Mahshahr\u2019s actual air temperature registered 115 degrees (46 Celsius) with an astonishing dew point temperature of 90 (32 Celsius)...\"\n\nGraphic credit above: \"Chart showing temperature, dew point in index in Bandar Mahshahr over last 36 hours, using National Weather Service heat index value calculations.\" (Brian McNoldy)\n\nDry Days Bring A Ferocious Start To The Fire Season. Here are a couple of excerpts from a story at The New York Times: \"...It is all part of an extensive nationwide scorching. About 63,312 wildfires destroyed 3.6 billion acres of land across the country last year, at a cost of $1.52 billion to fight the fires. Early projections have placed this year\u2019s cost even higher, at up to $2.1 billion, well beyond the $1.5 billion set aside by the federal Interior and Agriculture Departments, which administer more than 600 million acres of public lands. The Obama administration has asked Congress to place wildfires in the same category as hurricanes and floods, with a dedicated disaster fund to pay for their suppression...\"\n\nPhoto credit above: \"Firefighters walk under smoke from fires along Morgan Valley Road near Lower Lake, Calif., Friday, July 31, 2015.

What will that mean for web sites that depend on advertising? Here's a snippet of an interesting read at The Overspill: \"...Into this comes Apple, which guards the user experience on the iOS platform, its biggest moneymaker, very jealously. Apple\u2019s executives and staff aren\u2019t blind to the things that are going on; they use their phones, and they get the same experiences.

Here's the intro to a New York Times article: \" In the strongest action ever taken in the United States to combat climate change, President Obama will unveil on Monday a set of environmental regulations devised to sharply cut planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions from the nation\u2019s power plants and ultimately transform America\u2019s electricity industry. The rules are the final, tougher versions of proposed regulations that the Environmental Protection Agency announced in 2012 and 2014. If they withstand the expected legal challenges, the regulations will set in motion sweeping policy changes that could shut down hundreds of coal-fired power plants, freeze construction of new coal plants and create a boom in the production of wind and solar power and other renewable energy sources...\"\n\n* A Facebook video from President Obama and the White House explaining the need for the Clean Power Plan is here.\n\nDoes Global Warming Actually Increase Antarctic Sea Ice? Here's an excerpt from a good explanation at Discovery News: \"...Here\u2019s that scenario in simpler terms. While sea ice has been increasing, we know from analyzing satellite data that the ice covering the land mass of Antarctica has been melting rapidly. Hansen and colleagues think that as those ice shelves disintegrate, a lot of cold freshwater is draining into the Southern Ocean. That\u2019s creating a cold surface layer that is causing sea ice to form. Underneath that, though, the salty, denser subsurface waters are still warming...\"", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "While you were sleeping the calendar jumped exactly 1 month.
