That critic, Meghan Chamberlin, self-identified as a survivor of rape during a Facebook argument over Patricia Arquette\u2019s infamous Oscars speech, but Grundy mocked her anyway with lines like \u201cgo cry somewhere since that\u2019s what u do,\u201d and \u201c#whitegirltears,\u201d according to Fox News.\n\nGrundy\u2019s remarks were objectively nasty, but they were also grossly insensitive, given Chamberlin\u2019s situation. Still, an important question remains: Did Grundy read what Chamberlin had written before she responded, or was the professor oblivious to the fact that she was mercilessly berating a survivor of rape?\n\nBoston.com reporter Charlotte Wilder initially concluded\u2014based on Chamberlin\u2019s own statements\u2014that Grundy probably didn\u2019t know, before updating her post in light of an additional statement. The post was mildly critical of Fox News:\n\nThe woman Grundy is accused of trolling told Boston.com Tuesday afternoon that she didn\u2019t think Fox News got the story right. But she called back Tuesday evening, after speaking with a Fox News reporter, to say she did believe Grundy was aware that she had been raped when the professor argued with her online. This much is not in dispute: Grundy got in an argument online with Meghan Chamberlin, a woman who is a survivor of sexual assault. According to Grundy\u2019s friend, Frank Miller, Grundy didn\u2019t know when she argued with Chamberlin that Chamberlin had ever been assaulted. \u2026 Grundy declined to speak with Boston.com about her response to Chamberlin\u2019s comments. Fox News and Maxim Lott, the author of the article, did not respond to requests for comment. ... But Miller says Grundy responded to Chamberlin without clicking to read her full comment, and missed the context in which Charmberlin explained that she had been raped. Grundy wasn\u2019t trolling a \u201crape victim,\u201d Miller says: She was arguing with a woman she didn\u2019t know had been raped. \u201cIt blindsided her,\u201d Miller said. \u201cShe was like what? Who was raped?\u201d\n\nWilder also spoke with Chamberlin; that interview produced some bizarre quotations:\n\nWhen Boston.com first spoke with Chamberlin Tuesday, Chamberlin said she believed Grundy. \u201cI want brains like hers not in just higher education,\u201d Chamberlin said about Grundy. \u201cI wish we could have that open-mindedness and critical thinking in more places. I would like it my kids\u2019 elementary school.\u201d But in her later phone call to Boston.com, she said she believed that Grundy was aware that she had been raped when the argument took place.\n\nEven with the additional hedge from the later phone conversation, Chamberlin comes off as more pro-Grundy than one would expect after reading the Facebook exchange.\n\nI spoke with Chamberlin myself. She said those quotes were deprived of context\u2014making her appear inaccurately sympathetic to Grundy\u2014and invalidated by more current information. She told me that while she believes Grundy\u2019s perspective has value, she wasn\u2019t asserting that Grundy herself was the best representative of that perspective.\n\nChamberlin now believes that Grundy \u201cabsolutely knew\u201d about the rape when she made her comments. The professor has not apologized.\n\n\u201cShe knew who she was talking to,\u201d said Chamberlin. \u201cI\u2019m sickened that she gets away with getting to say nothing to me.\u201d\n\nStill, Chamberlin added: \u201cI don\u2019t want her to lose her job.\u201d\n\nChamberlin wants Wilder to take out her entire quote.\n\nWilder told me in an email that she believes the updated story accurately reflects the state of affairs:\n\nIt's as we explained in our story\u2014Meghan Chamberlin said one thing in the afternoon, and then called back at night to say she had changed her mind. The story with her original comments had been live for more than four hours at that point, so we decided the best option was to update it with her saying she had changed her mind. We also added a prominent note at the top of the story pointing out that it included additional new comments from Meghan Chamberlin.\n\nThe entire Facebook exchange between Grundy and her critics can be viewed here. Chamberlin\u2019s full comment, in which she mentions her rape, can be viewed here.\n\nPersonally, I can\u2019t be certain of what Grundy knew or didn\u2019t know\u2014and either way, I share Chamberlin\u2019s opinion that it would be wrong for Boston U. to fire the professor. Grundy should be free to share her views, even controversial and confrontational ones, without fear of institutional reprisal.\n\nBut I can\u2019t help but wonder how effective a teacher she will be. Angrily berating anyone who expresses disagreement isn\u2019t a good approach on Facebook, and it certainly isn\u2019t a good approach in the classroom.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "'Sickened\u2019 that Dr. Saida Grundy \u2018gets away with it\u2019", "title": "Boston U.
