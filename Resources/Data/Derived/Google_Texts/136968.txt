That local hero stuff doesn’t necessarily play in the NFL.

The Broncos made a roster move Saturday, promoting running back Jeremy Stewart from their practice squad and waiving former Colorado State running back Kapri Bibbs.

The 6-foot-1, 215-pound Stewart is from Baton Rouge, La. and Stanford. He was an undrafted rookie in 2012, when he bounced between the Philadelphia Eagles, New York Jets and Oakland Raiders.

He got 25 carries for 101 yards and eight catches for 62 yards in four games with the Raiders in 2012, and had two more carries and two receptions in 2013. He was signed to the Broncos’ practice squad six weeks ago.

With both Montee Ball and Ronnie Hillman out with injuries, the Broncos will use C.J. Anderson and rookie Juwan Thompson as their top two running backs Sunday against the Miami Dolphins.

Bibbs, who rushed for 1,731 yards and 31 touchdowns for the CSU Rams last year, was promoted from the Broncos’ practice squad to the 53-man roster four weeks ago but was never activated for a game. For the No. 3 running back position in their game Sunday, the Broncos decided to go with the more experienced Stewart.

There is a chance Bibbs would return to the Broncos’ practice squad if he clears waivers.
