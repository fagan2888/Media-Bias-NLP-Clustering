(Photo: Submitted photo)\n\nAs many have heard, Goodwill NCW\u2019s Harmony Cafes in Appleton and Green Bay will be closing for financial reasons, probably before January.\n\nThose who\u2019ve experienced Harmony Cafe know it\u2019s not the typical coffeehouse.\n\nWhen then-teenager A\u00f1a Marjenka and I dreamed up Harmony Cafe on a car ride to Madison 14 years ago, our intent was clear: to create a \u201csafe space\u201d here in Appleton \u2014 space where all people could feel fully seen, heard and valued.\n\nFor many, this entire community feels like \u201csafe space.\u201d But only in exceptional circumstances do we become aware of the importance of the safe space concept.\n\nThree years ago, 50 community leaders spent a full day learning about LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) people and issues. At the end of the day, a colleague and I led an experiential activity to offer the leaders a sense of what it is like to \u201cwalk in the shoes\u201d of someone who is LGBT.\n\nWe asked them to pair up with someone of the same gender and similar age. In pairs, they\u2019d go outside Harmony Caf\u00e9 on E. College Avenue and pretend they were a couple \u2014 maybe go across the street to the jewelers and look at engagement rings, maybe walk down the street holding hands. We gave them five minutes to make plans.\n\nAfter five anxious minutes, we informed them they weren\u2019t going anywhere; instead, we wanted to hear their thoughts and feelings. A number of people shared their anxiety and how the exercise gave them greater insight into the LGBT experience.\n\nThen one woman raised her hand and said, \u201cYou know, I had no concerns while inside these doors at Harmony Cafe, but was worried about stepping outside.\u201d\n\nQuickly, five or six others agreed. These leaders, who might rarely feel the need for safe space, suddenly understood its importance.\n\nMany of us feel valued \u2014 like an insider \u2014 most anywhere. But there are people in our community who feel like outsiders much of the time, often due to their ethnicity, skin color, religious beliefs, sexual orientation, gender, physical appearance, age, abilities or other aspect of their identity.\n\nHarmony Cafe was designed to be a space where all people would feel valued and included. From the start, we knew our \u201cCheck it at the Door Declaration\u201d was key, but we weren\u2019t even certain the cafe would be in a building, or if it would be a virtual cafe happening throughout our community \u2014 as it did our first three years). It became a program of Goodwill NCW in 2002.\n\nWe\u2019ve been blessed to have three buildings we\u2019ve called home and, though the buildings help create a sense of safe space, Harmony Cafe was never about the building. It was always about the people and ideals.\n\nEven if the buildings close, the ideals live on \u2014 the \u201cCheck at the Door Declaration\u201d; the striving for peace, harmony and justice; and the ability for all of us to create safe space in our homes, our schools, our workplaces and throughout our community.\n\nThough challenging work, when safe space is created, magic happens. The people I\u2019ve met through the years and the things I\u2019ve seen at Harmony Cafe can only be described as beautiful and magical.\n\nIt\u2019s been a wonderful journey and I know the legacy of Harmony Cafe will live on in the hearts of all those touched by this dream \u2014 those inspired to bring a bit of Harmony Cafe with them as they leave our doors.\n\nIt\u2019s awe-inspiring to see what a bunch of good people can do when they come together and bring a dream to life. Lives have been changed. Lives have been saved.\n\nFor that, I\u2019m forever grateful and, in Harmony\u2019s memory, I challenge you all to create safe space everywhere in our community.\n\n\u2014 Shannon Kenevan is the diversity and inclusion leader at Goodwill NCW and a co-founder of Harmony Cafe.
