Democrats must learn from it.\n\nWas it really Obamacare that sunk Sink? I mean of course Alex Sink, the Democratic Florida congressional candidate who lost to Republican David Jolly on Tuesday. After the results were announced, Washington\u2019s conventional wisdom congealed immediately: This was all about Obamacare, and it\u2019s going to doom the Democrats come November.\n\nNot so fast, says Geoff Garin, the pollster who did Sink\u2019s polling in the race. Garin argues in a memo he released the day of the voting that \u201cthe issue ultimately provided more of a lift than a drag to her campaign.\u201d He followed up by telling me yesterday: \u201cShe would have done worse if she\u2019d neglected to hit back and engage the issue.\u201d There\u2019s a lesson in there for Democrats as they march toward November.\n\nGarin put two key questions to the district\u2019s voters. The first paraphrased the criticisms of Sink on Obamacare: Sink supports this law that will take away $716 billion from Medicare, and that caused 300,000 Floridians to lose their coverage and 2,500 patients at a district cancer center to have to change doctors. The second paraphrased criticisms of Jolly\u2019s health-care position: He wants to totally repeal the law instead of fix it, a position that would let insurers again discriminate against the already ill and charge women more than they charge men for coverage. Repeal would also cut expanded prescription-drug coverage for Medicare recipients.\n\nRespondents were asked to say whether this information gave them \u201cvery major doubts\u201d about the candidates, \u201cfairly major\u201d doubts, \u201cjust some\u201d doubts, or \u201cno real\u201d doubts. Results: While 43 percent now entertained very major doubts about Sink, 50 percent said they had very major doubts about Jolly. And 35 percent had no real doubts about Sink while only 26 percent had no real doubts about Jolly.\n\nIf that polling is accurate, then \u201cmore lift than drag\u201d is accurate and fair. Guy Molyneux, a partner of Garin\u2019s who oversaw some Obamacare polling for a couple of unions in January, echoed the point that there are at least three things Democrats can say about the law and the Republicans\u2019 repeal zeal that poll really well. People broadly understand, Molyneux told me, that the law protects against discrimination based on pre-existing conditions, and they approve of that strongly. They also know that insurers can no longer drop sick people on whim, and they like that. And they\u2019re getting to know that the law prevents insurers from charging women more than men, and they like that, too; even men.\n\nThere\u2019s one more thing that people don\u2019t yet know very well, but the polling indicates that it could be a strong debating point, too: Under the law, insurers have to publicly justify any rate increases greater than 10 percent. This is called rate review, and it and the medical-loss ratio provisions of the law (explained here) are the two main planks that guard against willy-nilly rate hikes. A Heath and Human Services study from last September found that nearly 7 million citizens had saved more than $1 billion because of rate review, and moreover, that insurance companies were seeking increases of 10 percent far less frequently than before the law because of the added oversight.\n\nSince everybody and his brother assumes that the Affordable Care Act is going to increase their rates, seems to me it\u2019d be awfully useful for the Democrats to develop a sharp talking point or two explaining to people that the law actually helps prevent crazy premium increases.\n\nThis all makes the Obamacare story a lot more complicated than \u201cdisaster for Dems.\u201d It just doesn\u2019t have to be. Republicans know this, too. Why are they, or some of them, suddenly talking about replacing the law? Precisely to try to insulate themselves from the effective Democratic attack that they\u2019d give carte blanche to insurance companies to go back to their old ways.\n\nIt\u2019s worth dwelling on this for a paragraph\u2014it\u2019s important to understand. It was in the spring of 2010 that the GOP unveiled \u201crepeal and replace.\u201d They stuck with that through the election. Then, once they\u2019d retaken the House, they dropped \u201creplace\u201d and went for \u201crepeal\u201d only. Now that a midterm election is coming again, though, they\u2019re starting to put \u201creplace\u201d back in their rhetoric. But it\u2019s as hollow this time as it was then. \u201cOur challenge,\u201d Molyneux told me, \u201cis to show that there\u2019s nothing behind the curtain there.\u201d\n\nLord knows, the Democrats have more problems than health care staring them in the face for the fall. The turnout question is the biggest one, although they say they\u2019re making efforts this time that have no precedent in a midterm election. And Obama\u2019s bad approval numbers\u2014worse still in many of the states with high-profile Senate contests\u2014are a huge factor. \u201cIf Obama\u2019s still at 41 percent in mid-October, we\u2019re in a world of hurt,\u201d Molyneux says. And finally, but far from least, the economy. An awful, awful number from this week\u2019s NBC/Wall Street Journal poll: Fully 57 percent of those surveyed said they think we\u2019re still in a recession.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "mtomasky"}, "keywords": "Florida,United States, u.s. poli, Obamacare, Democratic Party", "publicationDate": 201403140945, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "description": "Forget the conventional wisdom\u2014the health-care issue actually helped Alex Sink a little.
