The document laid out the legal rationale for a drone-missile strike that killed terror suspect Anwar al-Awlaki in Yemen in 2011.\n\nThe 2010 memo, which a court released Monday, has been at the heart of a debate about the legality of the U.S. government ordering deadly force from a drone against a U.S. citizen overseas. The strike that killed Mr. Awlaki also killed Samir Khan, a U.S. citizen who edited the terrorist magazine Inspire.\n\nThe document was released with significant redactions, but the general principle behind such a drone strike is evident: When senior government officials conclude a person is actively plotting to use deadly force against Americans, and the U.S. government is unable to apprehend them, officials may use lethal force to kill that person, even if they are a U.S. citizen.\n\nThe memo concluded that the use of lethal force is acceptable \u201cat least where high-level government officials have determined that a capture operation overseas is infeasible, and that the targeted person is part of a dangerous enemy force and is engaged in activities that pose a continued and imminent threat to U.S. persons or interests.\u201d\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union and the New York Times had filed a lawsuit in federal court in New York to force the government to release the memo.\n\nThe memo was written by Acting Assistant Attorney General David Barron, whose nomination to the federal appeals court in Boston was delayed earlier this year while lawmakers demanded the public release of the document explaining the Obama administration\u2019s legal rationale for a lethal drone strike against a U.S. citizen. Mr. Barron\u2019s nomination was eventually approved after lawmakers were able to examine the memo.\n\nThe memo compared the use of a drone strike to a police officer faced with an immediate decision on whether to use deadly force against a suspect threatening to harm others\u2014though it went on to add: \u201cWhat would constitute a reasonable use of lethal force for purposes of domestic law enforcement operations will be very different from what would be reasonable in a situation like such as that at issue here.\u201d\n\nContinue reading at WSJ.com.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "The U.S. government can kill an American citizen abroad if that person is plotting to attack Americans and U.S. authorities can't apprehend them, according to a newly declassified government memo.", "title": "Declassified Memo Lays Out Legal Rationale for Drone Strikes on Citizens", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2014/06/23/declassified-memo-lays-out-legal-rationale-for-drone-missile-strike/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Business", "article.headline": "Declassified Memo Lays Out Legal Rationale for Drone Strikes on Citizens", "description": "The U.S. government can kill an American citizen abroad if that person is plotting to attack Americans and U.S. authorities can't apprehend them, according to a newly declassified government memo.", "article_section": "Business", "author": "Devlin Barrett", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Law Blog Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Law Blog", "article.summary": "The U.S. government can kill an American citizen abroad if that person is plotting to attack Americans and U.S. authorities can't apprehend them, according to a newly declassified government memo.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-06-23T17:12:38-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-161", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2014/06/23/declassified-memo-lays-out-legal-rationale-for-drone-missile-strike/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-LB-48418", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Business", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "The U.S. government can kill an American citizen abroad if that person is plotting to attack Americans and U.S. authorities can't apprehend them, according to a newly declassified government memo.", "title": "Declassified Memo Lays Out Legal Rationale for Drone Strikes on Citizens", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2014/06/23/declassified-memo-lays-out-legal-rationale-for-drone-missile-strike/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Law Blog", "article.id": "BL-LB-48418", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-06-23T17:23:51-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd398d\"", "article_summary": "The document laid out the legal rationale for a drone-missile strike that killed terror suspect Anwar al-Awlaki in Yemen in 2011.\nThe strike that killed Mr. Awlaki also killed Samir Khan, a U.S. citizen who edited the terrorist magazine Inspire.\nAFP/Getty ImagesThe U.S. government can kill an American citizen abroad if that person is plotting to attack Americans and U.S. authorities can\u2019t apprehend them, according to a newly declassified government memo.\nMr. Barron\u2019s nomination was eventually approved after lawmakers were able to examine the memo.\nThe 2010 memo, which a court released Monday, has been at the heart of a debate about the legality of the U.S. government ordering deadly force from a drone against a U.S. citizen overseas."}
