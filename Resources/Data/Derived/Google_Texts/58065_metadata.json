Syringes sealed in packages, linens, soaps and more.\n\nAnd at the group\u2019s other sites? Almost new operating tables that sell for about $100,000 apiece, along with wheelchairs, crutches and exam tables.\n\nThe word used by one first-time visitor to describe this bounty of potentially life-saving medical supplies? \u2014 \u201cSad.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s pretty powerful,\u201d University of New England third-year physical therapy student Karen Bartling said Friday. \u201cThere\u2019s got to be millions of dollars of supplies here, and all of it was just going to be thrown out. It\u2019s kind of sad.\u201d\n\nPartners for World Health is a now four-year-old nonprofit founded by McLellan, who gathers the medical supplies from hospitals across Maine with a promise to sort them and redistribute them to areas of need both domestically and overseas.\n\nThis year, Partners for World Health will send six shipping containers of health care supplies, weighing between 30,000 and 40,000 pounds and worth between $250,000 and $500,000 apiece, to places such as Bangladesh, Senegal and Cambodia. McLellan said her organization has enough supplies to ship out at least 12 containers every year, but hasn\u2019t raised enough in donations to make that many shipments.\n\nOn Friday, Bartling and six UNE classmates spent the morning helping organize the latest hospital giveaways in exchange for a load of supplies for their own purposes. As part of a school project funded by a grant from the university\u2019s Center for Excellence in Interprofessional Education, the students are launching a 10-week program next month to help recently diagnosed diabetes patients in the area properly monitor their conditions and make healthy lifestyle choices.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of good being done both close to home and in underdeveloped countries by McLellan\u2019s efforts to pull medical supplies out of the waste streams of Maine hospitals \u2014 in 2012, for instance, Pen Bay Healthcare in Rockport trumpeted that the organization had donated 3,600 pounds of supplies to Partners for World Health and saved $8,180 in waste disposal costs as a result.\n\nBut McLellan said the success of her group is a sign of trouble in its own right: Hospitals across the state, many of which are facing financial difficulties, are buying and throwing away millions of dollars worth of supplies.\n\nThose throwaways come in many different forms, McLellan said. Sometimes nurses bring a couple of backup syringes into a patient\u2019s room, just in case, and leave them there. When the patient leaves, the extra syringes are thrown away along with the used supplies. Other times, hospitals include new furniture in their capital budgets without considering whether the existing furniture needs replacing, she said.\n\nPhone calls seeking comments from the Maine Hospital Association, Eastern Maine Medical Center and Maine Medical Center were not immediately returned.\n\nThose revelations come at a time when health care costs in Maine and America have come under increased scrutiny. Between 1993 and 2009, spending on health care in the state shot up by 214 percent \u2014 from $3.6 billion overall to $11.2 billion \u2014 and Maine was recently reported to rank fifth in the country in per capita medical spending.\n\nWhile McLellan acknowledged that the state faces complicated problems on the health care front, including an aging population and insurance changes brought about in part by President Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act, she said some of the high cost of medical treatment here and across the country can be traced back to the thousands of pounds of usable supplies thrown away each year.\n\nMcLellan said she\u2019s putting as much of that waste as she can to good use, but added, holding a syringe still sealed in a plastic package, \u201cIf you\u2019re a hospital and can save this and use it in your system, I\u2019ll give it back to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is an expense,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is one reason why our health care is so expensive. Someone has to take ownership of this at a high level and make changes.\n\n\u201cWe have to start think about things differently,\u201d McLellan said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a big problem in this country.
