Some controllers, for example, jeopardized flight navigation by allowing planes to fly too close together. The AP also cited that 60 percent of air traffic controllers fell asleep while driving to their late shifts, while 20 percent reported committing \u201csignificant errors\u201d due to lack of sleep.\n\nWorking the night shift, as air traffic controllers typically do, is a known cause of fatigue. Not only does fatigue increase risk of errors at work, but studies show working an irregular schedule can also increase risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality. Additional research even shows that tiredness can increase risk of some cancers, diabetes, and infertility. Even so, everyone experiences fatigue differently.\n\n\u201cFatigue is personal and individualized,\u201d Dr. Adam Rindfleisch, of the University of Wisconsin's Department of Family Medicine, Integrative Medicine, told The Daily Burn. \u201cSince there are a number of reasons why someone could feel fatigued, it\u2019s important your doctor tailors his or her diagnosis to your individual symptoms and needs.\u201d\n\nSince the air control study specifically mentions sleep, we\u2019ll break down the effects poor sleep-induced fatigued has on some parts of the body.\n\nBrain\n\nResearch continues to show poor sleep habits worsen health. It\u2019s not just the amount of sleep people get that\u2019s important, it\u2019s the quality of sleep they get, too. Chronic sleep deprivation has been linked to cardiovascular disease, depression, and even brain damage, Mitchell Moffitt and Greg Brown wrote in their book AsapSCIENCE: Answers to the World\u2019s Weirdest Questions, Most Persistent Rumors, and Unexplained Phenomena.\n\n\u201cAfter your first sleepless night your mesolimbic system becomes stimulated and dopamine runs rampant. And this may actually trigger some energy, motivation, positivity, even sex drive,\u201d Moffitt and Brown said. \u201cSounds appealing, but it\u2019s a slippery slope! Your brain slowly begins to shut off the regions responsible for planning and evaluating decisions, leading to more impulsive behavior. Once exhaustion sets in, you\u2019ll find yourself with slow reaction times and reduced perceptual and cognitive functions.\u201d\n\nMuscles\n\nFatigue is marked by muscle weakness, a symptom that can exacerbate existing conditions, like arthritis. According to a 2008 study published in The Journal of Physiology, one of the many mechanisms responsible for weakness and decreased exertion is \u201cthe accumulation of metabolites within muscle fibers.\u201d However, researchers note these mechanisms are specific to the tasks being performed.\n\n\u201cMuscle fatigue, it seems, can refer to a motor deficit, a perception or a decline in mental function; it can describe the gradual decrease in the force capacity of muscle or the endpoint of a sustained activity; and it can be measured as a reduction in muscle force, a change in electromyographic activity, or an exhaustion of contractile function,\u201d the researchers wrote.\n\nSkin\n\nYep, fatigue can literally show on your face. Moffitt and Brown cited studies that have shown a direct correlation between sleep deprivation and a person\u2019s perceived beauty. \u201cThat is to say, sleep-deprived individuals appeared less healthy and less attractive than when they were well rested,\u201d the two concluded.\n\nEveryday Health reported, too, that not enough sleep exacerbates existing skin conditions. It increases \u201cinflammatory response,\u201d which is why fatigued patients may experience more breakouts, sensitivity, and dullness. In fact, with an increased amount of inflammatory cells in the body, it causes the body to breakdown more collagen and hyaluronic acid, the two molecules responsible for your skin\u2019s glow.\n\nCorrection: This article originally conflated chronic fatigue and chronic fatigue syndrome.
