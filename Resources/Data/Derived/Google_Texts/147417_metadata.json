I didn\u2019t even know how to find my medical records. Because I just turned forty and got insured through the Affordable Care Act, I decided to finally establish primary care and do blood pressure, cholesterol, and cancer screenings. \u201cWhile you\u2019re there,\u201d my girlfriend Rebekah advised, \u201chave them check your toe.\u201d I had a bum toe. It hurt but I\u2019d worked around it for two years. What I called \u2018busted\u2019 was probably arthritis, not that I ever said the word \u2018arthritis\u2019 out loud.\n\nAccording to the American Academy of Family Physicians, 85% of U.S. men seek treatment when they\u2019re sick, and six out of ten of them go to a doctor. But most doctors will tell you that American men, far more than women, avoid the doctor and routine physicals with a devious cunning. It isn\u2019t because we\u2019re tough or less susceptible to illness. It\u2019s because we\u2019re idiots. Instead of embracing the power of knowledge and early detection, men stubbornly resist information and treatment for the short-term gain of autonomy and convenience, as if by avoiding the details of our lives, they won\u2019t affect us. If ignorance is bliss, then making things easy is awesome. That\u2019s unconscious dude logic. Why get that rash checked when all our other rashes went away themselves? Just hobble around on that bad toe and hope for the best \u2014 or don\u2019t hope; just get used to the new painful paradigm and proceed as usual. Who has time for this stuff? So you\u2019re short of breath and have occasional chest pain. You and everyone else, man. Suck it up. Life\u2019s busy and work is stressful. You haven\u2019t died yet. The thing is, you might die if something serious goes undetected, and that pain won\u2019t always pass. Ignorance is not bliss, because knowledge is power. Men can be such dumbasses. My dumbass had postponed a simple checkup for my entire thirties.\n\nWhy don\u2019t men go to the doctor? \u201cI just don\u2019t do it,\u201d my coworker Dan said with a shrug. He\u2019s forty-nine and hasn\u2019t seen a doctor in probably twenty years. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Two local primary care doctors I know admitted they haven\u2019t had a check up in nine and fifteen years, respectively, for the same reason.\n\nDuring my first doctor\u2019s visit in over a decade, a nurse sat me in a small room and asked a series of questions: Any specific issues? Are you a smoker? How often do you drink? Do you have allergies or take medications? My answers to her other questions were no, no, a little, no, no. \u201cWell,\u201d she said, \u201caren\u2019t you just an easy patient.\u201d With no kids, exemptions, or government subsidies, I told her, my taxes were just as easy.\n\nThe nurse read my blood pressure at 110 over 72. Apparently, that was good. I didn\u2019t know, but I wasn\u2019t surprised. I don\u2019t smoke. I don\u2019t do drugs. I drink alcohol sparingly and drink tons of green tea. In the words of a woman in line at a Japanese market where I was buying stacks of canned fish, I eat \u201clike a Japanese person.\u201d That\u2019s my preventative regimen: fish, seaweed, miso, tofu, tea, little refined sugar and very little dairy. Despite our best efforts, though, the body breaks down, and family history plays a role in our health. My dad\u2019s side of the family is plagued with ham-, biscuits-and-gravy- and enchilada-induced heart disease, cholesterol and diabetes, which is one reason I improved my diet in college in the first place.\n\nA 2007 American Academy of Family Physicians survey said 23% of men avoid the doctor because \u201cthey are healthy and don\u2019t need to see a doctor.\u201d 36% \u201conly go to the doctor when they are extremely sick.\u201d 8% don\u2019t like the doctor, and 7% avoided because \u201cthey are afraid of finding out something is wrong with them.\u201d It isn\u2019t just checkups. Men with symptoms and on-going problems still won\u2019t come in.\n\nThe nurse left and I waited for my new doctor. The room was small. It had bare cement floors, an exam table, and two wooden chairs by a long counter crowned with a bottle of Purell. Three boxes of rubber gloves hung from the wall by my chair. Three seemed excessive. It was hard not to interpret them as a warning about the rectal exam I was sure loomed in my future.\n\nMy new PCP came in and introduced herself as Suki. She reviewed my answers to the nurse\u2019s questions, asked about my family history, and laid me on the table to do some exams. My blood pressure was good, she said, my BMI, glands, ears, eyes, all good. The next step was blood work. \u201cBlood test will tell what\u2019s happening inside you,\u201d Suki said, \u201cespecially with your family history.\u201d I scheduled the blood draw for 8 a.m. the following week. The line to make an appointment at the front desk took longer than my exam. The whole visit was so quick and easy that it seemed ridiculous to have avoided it for so long.\n\nA 2007 American Academy of Family Physicians survey said 23% of men avoid the doctor because \u201cthey are healthy and don\u2019t need to see a doctor.\u201d 36% \u201conly go to the doctor when they are extremely sick.\u201d 8% don\u2019t like the doctor, and 7% avoided because \u201cthey are afraid of finding out something is wrong with them.\u201d It isn\u2019t just checkups. Men with symptoms and on-going problems still won\u2019t come in.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty well understood fact,\u201d said one PCP I\u2019ll call Brian. \u201cMost of my male patients who do come in, their ears are a little red from all the twisting their significant other did to get them to see the doctor.\u201d When Brian was an intern, he saw one patient who came to the hospital after enduring sixteen hours of crushing chest pain, nausea and vomiting. \u201cHe decided to come in the very next day,\u201d Brian said, \u201cto, quote, \u2018find out what that was.\u2019 \u2018Well sir, you had a heart attack, and it would\u2019ve been nice if you came in yesterday instead of today.\u2019 But denial is not just a river in Egypt, right?\u201d\n\nAdults aren\u2019t the only culprits. Boys can be very stoic and disguise their pain so well that doctors miss a diagnosis. Brian recently did a vasectomy on a twelve-year-old. Around that age, boys\u2019 testicles twist, and they can twist on the testicular artery in a way that it cuts blood flow to the testicle, which causes a lot of pain. When the patient came back later, he told Brian, \u201cYeah it swelled up really bad, and it kind of hurt a little bit, and then I felt better in two days, and then the testicle just shriveled up and went away.\u201d That\u2019s because the testicle was necrotic. It died, and the boy hadn\u2019t sought medical attention. \u201cSometimes people just tough it out and walk it off,\u201d Brian said. \u201cI don\u2019t understand it fully.\u201d\n\nWhen Suki asked if the pelvic exam felt okay, I said yes. Then when she told me to sit up, I admitted there had been a little tension down in my lower right part of my abdomen, below my beltline. She felt it again. \u201cHow long has this been going on?\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the causes are multifarious. \u201cSome of it\u2019s probably cultural,\u201d Brian said. \u201cWe\u2019re told to be self-reliant and not to worry about it. Some of it\u2019s just the male psyche, that same psyche that makes us feel comfortable putting a gun in our hands and going off to war, a sense of invincibility.\u201d As the old saying goes: doctors often make the worst patients.\n\nBrian is forty-three, has worked in medicine for almost two decades, and his last physical was his pre-residency physical in 1999. He hasn\u2019t seen a doctor since he was forced into the ER when he crashed his bike and blacked out in 2000; after flying over his handlebars, he woke up while the paramedics were strapping him to a backboard. Why the avoidance? \u201cI get my annual flu shot at work,\u201d he said laughing, \u201ca tetanus shot regularly. I go to the dentist.\u201d He has a little dermatitis, which he treats with hydrocortisone. He has some allergies, but he can use over-the-counter medications for those. \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he said. \u201cFine enough.\u201d He also knows that an annual checkup isn\u2019t going to save him.\n\nTraditionally, patients were told to get examined once a year, but the medical community\u2019s belief in the efficacy of the annual checkup is changing. \u201cThe idea that having a physical at age 20 or 30 is going to make you live longer than if you don\u2019t do that until you\u2019re 50, is probably not true,\u201d Brian said. \u201cIt depends on your age, your risk factors and your medical condition.\u201d For men between ages eighteen and thirty, many primary care physicians believes it\u2019s reasonable to get examined every three to five years. Unless you\u2019re overweight, have diabetes, a family history or other risk factors that need to be addressed, it isn\u2019t suicidal for a man to wait until they\u2019re 40 to get an exam and check their cholesterol, as long they get immunized regularly, get a flu shot, and get their blood pressure checked annually. You can do that at a grocery store or pharmacy. \u201cI certainly wouldn\u2019t recommend you only go to the doctor every 10 years,\u201d Brian said, \u201cyou need to establish care so you have a doctor to go to when you are sick. But the idea that you need to come in every single year to stay healthy is not helpful.\u201d\n\nAs for the ER visit in 2000, he said, \u201cI haven\u2019t gone to the doctor since.\u201d\n\nOne reason women are more comfortable seeing a doctor, and going in for regular checkups, is reproductive health. Issues such as birth control and abnormal periods bring women to the doctor more regularly and at an early age. Women get in the habit. They get used to making appointments and keeping up on their body\u2019s condition. Unless something burns when we pee, or we have a chronic health condition from a young age \u2014 or they\u2019re hypochondriacs \u2014 fewer men reflexively reach out to doctors for help.\n\nAnother reason is cultural: women seem more used to asking for help. They\u2019re comfortable with it, less threatened by the implicit vulnerability of assistance. Men can be stubborn, know-it-alls, and mansplainers. Asking for help isn\u2019t a distressed damsel situation. It\u2019s a sign of strength. Sometimes the best way to solve a problem is to ask a professional for assistance. Men show how weak and foolish we can be when we mistake extreme self-reliance as strength; true strength comes from asking for help when you need it, and when you\u2019re hobbling around on a bad toe, or you have chest pain, you need it.\n\nAside from general male stubbornness, many of us don\u2019t want anyone infringing on our autonomy. We want to drink, play sports, and eat what we want whenever we want, as if we were eighteen. So we avoid the doctor to avoid being told what we don\u2019t want to hear. When our girlfriends or wives ask about our health, we often lie. We withhold information. We do the same with doctors. When a doctor asks, \u201cAny specific issues to address?\u201d too many men say, \u201cNo, I feel great,\u201d even when we don\u2019t. I did this myself.\n\nWhen Suki asked if the pelvic exam felt okay, I said yes. Then when she told me to sit up, I admitted there had been a little tension down in my lower right part of my abdomen, below my beltline. She felt it again. \u201cHow long has this been going on?\u201d\n\nI said, \u201cJust now.\u201d That wasn\u2019t true. I\u2019d felt it the last three days. I didn\u2019t want to deal with it then, and I didn\u2019t want to deal with it now, yet I was still concerned enough to mention it in passing, however scaled down a version of the truth. Although I\u2019m concerned about what this tension is and that it might get worse, my withholding of information proves that I\u2019m more concerned about my time than my health. I already do stretches in the morning. I don\u2019t want to add any more time-sucks or medications to my daily routine. Maybe my skinny jeans are too skinny. Maybe they\u2019re pressing on something vital along my waistline. Suki advised I let her know if the tension continued. It has on and off since my exam, but not enough to talk to her more about it. This is a stupid approach to your health, yet I\u2019m aware of it even as I\u2019m doing it.\n\nI\u2019m worried about a lot of things. Even though I no longer abuse my body the way I did in my teens, my job keeps me seated at the computer too much. I don\u2019t exercise enough. I might look lean and clean from the outside, but with my family history and my excessive sitting, the time has come to make regular exercise as central a part of my health regimen as diet. I would not have made that change had Suki not told me I needed to. When I asked her how much a forty-year-old should be exercising each week, she advised thirty minutes a day, every day. Then she said, \u201cYou need to do this. Jog, hike, bike \u2014 whatever, but it\u2019s important.\u201d She provided an unanticipated prescription on my visit: motivation.\n\n\u2666\u25ca\u2666\n\nI went in for a blood draw on Friday morning. Then I skateboarded to work to get exercise.\n\nI held the phone to my ear and thought, That\u2019s what I had avoided for fifteen years? Everything\u2019s good and normal? In one sense, this just confirmed my own hyper-individualistic male thinking, that I had been right to avoid the doctor all these years, that I didn\u2019t need checkups at all. I was fine.\n\nA nurse called the following Monday. \u201cWe got your blood work back,\u201d she said. \u201cEverything looks good and normal.\u201d\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d I said. \u201cGood and normal?\u201d That\u2019s right. No diabetes, no cancer cells, healthy cholesterol levels. I wasn\u2019t shocked, but I was relieved.\n\nThe nurse said, \u201cOkay, you have a nice day.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks but just a second,\u201d I said. \u201cSo that\u2019s it?\n\nShe said, \u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d Suki said that new patients could schedule a follow up appointment in three months if they wanted. Otherwise, unless I had an issue that required treatment, we were done.\n\nI held the phone to my ear and thought, That\u2019s what I had avoided for fifteen years? Everything\u2019s good and normal? In one sense, this just confirmed my own hyper-individualistic male thinking, that I had been right to avoid the doctor all these years, that I didn\u2019t need checkups at all. I was fine. The visit might have felt anticlimactic, but it was a valuable lesson in the changes that come with aging. I might not have needed to adjust my diet, but I needed to start exercising. And I have: I\u2019m riding my bike, doing jumping jacks, and skating more, for at least thirty minutes a day, or an hour every other day. I also learned that I had ten more years to postpone other things. At the end of our visit, I asked Suki about prostate cancer and colon exams. \u201cYou won\u2019t need a colonoscopy until you\u2019re fifty,\u201d she said. I grinned and felt my whole body go slack. See, I thought, that wasn\u2019t so bad.\n\n_____\n\nThis article originally appeared on Medium for Human Parts.\n\nPhoto credit: Getty Images", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Good Men Project", "description": "Why don't men go to the doctor?", "title": "My First Doctor\u2019s Visit in Fifteen Years -", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 588, "identifier": "http://goodmenproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-21-at-3.54.56-PM.jpg", "height": 448}, "updated_time": "2015-09-23T17:41:37-04:00", "url": "http://goodmenproject.com/uncategorized/my-first-doctors-visit-in-fifteen-years-kt/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thegoodmenproject", "published_time": "2015-09-23T19:30:31-04:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/HumanPartsonMedium", "section": "Advice & Confessions", "modified_time": "2015-09-23T17:41:37-04:00", "tag": "wellness"}, "fb": {"admins": 1467427114, "app_id": 794063960644791}, "twitter": {"description": "Why don't men go to the doctor?", "creator": "@human_parts", "image": "http://goodmenproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-21-at-3.54.56-PM.jpg", "title": "My First Doctor\u2019s Visit in Fifteen Years -", "site": "@goodmenproject", "card": "summary"}}, "article_summary": "During my first doctor\u2019s visit in over a decade, a nurse sat me in a small room and asked a series of questions: Any specific issues?\nBut most doctors will tell you that American men, far more than women, avoid the doctor and routine physicals with a devious cunning.\nThe visit might have felt anticlimactic, but it was a valuable lesson in the changes that come with aging.\nThe whole visit was so quick and easy that it seemed ridiculous to have avoided it for so long.\nAt the end of our visit, I asked Suki about prostate cancer and colon exams."}
