This occurs during \u2018sting\u2019 operations, when agents pose as members of the Muslim American community, infiltrating mosques.\n\nIn an average sting operation, an undercover agent finds a suspect who they think is, say, selling illegal arms. They approach them and gather information, waiting for a crime to unfold.\n\nHowever, when it comes to counter-terrorism operations, law enforcement officers have been accused of breaching this time-honored system, using a subject\u2019s mental disability to actually foster terrorism. You read that right, by the way \u2014 counter-terrorism efforts are being used to foster terrorism.\n\nIn one instance a man named Rezwan Ferdaus was targeted by an FBI agent who infiltrated his local mosque. Although the FBI concluded he had mental disabilities, the FBI agent worked to gain the trust of Ferdaus. As they grew closer, the FBI agent convinced him to participate in a plot to blow up the Pentagon and US Capitol.\n\nFerdaus was supplied with fake weapons but as the plan unfolded, he grew visibly distressed. As Ferdaus deteriorated, he lost control of his bladder in such a severe way he was forced to wear diapers during the day. He also began to suffer from seizures and extreme weight loss. Eventually his health suffered so terribly, his father had to quit his job to care for him.\n\nFerdaus was later convicted of supplying material support to terrorism and is now serving a 17 year sentence in prison.\n\nAnother case of exploiting the mentally disabled involved Shawahar Matin Siraj. Described by the FBI as being \u2018extremely impressionable due to severe intellectual limitations,\u2019 he liked to spend his time playing video games and Pok\u00e9mon in his mother\u2019s house.\n\nAn undercover FBI agent who claimed to have a terminal illness (which mirrored the illness of Siraj\u2019s late father) cozied up to him, and wove an emotional web around the vulnerable man. After the agent broached the idea of a terrorist attack to him, which involved blowing up a local subway station, Siraj is on record as saying he \u2018had to ask his mother first.\u2019 Even by the FBI\u2019s own reports, Siraj never actually agreed to participate.\n\nStill, he was convicted on four counts of conspiring to attack a subway station. On his first day in prison, Siraj apparently asked the guard for access to play Pok\u00e9mon.\n\nThe report also details cases of harsh detainment that fly in the face of due process.\n\nUzair Paracha, who was arrested in the United States, spent two years in solitary confinement before his trial, only allowed to speak to guards. What this means is, in our system of \u2018innocent until proven guilty,\u2019 he was given some of the harshest legal punishment available before he was even convicted of a crime.\n\nAlthough many have been quick to blame the Muslim American community for allowing extremism to foster, the reality is, they have been responsible for stopping 40% of all Islamic terrorist plots, conceived on US soil, in the last 10 years. A study by MPAC also showed Muslims made up a minority of all terrorist plots hatched in the United States, most being attributed to right wing extremism.\n\nHowever, despite these pesky facts, it seems the Muslim American community can\u2019t catch a break. Human Rights Watch noted that appropriate sentencing, the right to a fair trial, freedom from coercion and fairly conducted investigations have all been thrown by the wayside in the past 13 years.\n\nOther abusive methods involve targeting minors for sting operations, dismissing claims of torture and infiltrating mosques in ethnically targeted zones to conduct unwarranted surveillance on U.S. citizens.\n\nThese actions have created discord and mistrust between the US government and American Muslims. As Aziz Poonwalla writes, \u201cMuslim Americans have the same vested interest in preventing terrorism as any other fellow citizen\u2026American Muslims have arguably borne a greater responsibility in preventing attacks. That is a responsibility that the Muslim community has accepted and has faithfully upheld.\u201d\n\nYet if reports like this are any indication, the U.S. government has returned this favor by abusing the rights of Muslim-American citizens, compromising not only the moral integrity of the nation, but putting us all at risk of future attacks going unreported by citizens too afraid of their own government to speak out.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new report shows that US law enforcement is using the mentally impaired to conduct stings an jail some of nation's most vulnerable community.", "og": {"image": "http://dingo.care2.com/pictures/causes/3105/3104766.large.jpg"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "34d24671362965e0c3942e7b3b484ea7"}, "fb": {"app_id": 83187307959}, "keywords": "islam,muslim,muslim americans,hrw,fbi,us law enforcement,human rights,jail,stings", "viewport": "width=device-width,user-scalable=no,initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf26c\"", "article_summary": "In one instance a man named Rezwan Ferdaus was targeted by an FBI agent who infiltrated his local mosque.\nAlthough the FBI concluded he had mental disabilities, the FBI agent worked to gain the trust of Ferdaus.\nHowever, despite these pesky facts, it seems the Muslim American community can\u2019t catch a break.\nThis occurs during \u2018sting\u2019 operations, when agents pose as members of the Muslim American community, infiltrating mosques.\nAs they grew closer, the FBI agent convinced him to participate in a plot to blow up the Pentagon and US Capitol."}
