The for-profit healthcare chain reported an adjusted EBITDA of $460 million for the period that ended on June 30, roughly $124 million more than the same quarter last year\u2014roughly a 36.9 percent increase.\n\nAdmissions and adjusted admissions grew by 2.8 percent and 4 percent compared to 2013 while outpatient visits sailed upward by 7.1 percent. Surgeries grew by 8.3 percent and its bad debt dipped by 18.2 percent, which is about 7.3 percent of its revenue compared to the 9 percent it made up in 2013.\n\nFetter tapered expectations that the Affordable Care Act is the primary reason for the increases: Only about one-quarter of the EBITDA growth and about one third of adjusted admissions are due to strategies implemented around the ACA, he said.\n\n\u201cIn a way, I\u2019m delighted to have this fantastic quarter,\u201d he said in an interview, \u201cbut it would\u2019ve been nice to show a quarter like this pre-ACA because it would\u2019ve demonstrated that the business is solid and the strategies are working. The ACA is just icing on the cake.\u201d\n\nDuring the open enrollment period, Fetter says 97 percent of Tenet\u2019s hospitals\u2014which reached 80 total this week, with the purchase of the 354-bed Emanuel Medical Center in Turlock, California\u2014were contracted in at least one exchange plan. Eighty-seven percent of those were contracted with the lowest or second lowest priced Silver plan.\n\nExchange plans accounted for 2,700 admissions and more than 24,000 outpatient visits during that period: \u201cWe were well positioned, and as a result we are confident that we have gained market share in these important commercial insurance products,\u201d he said during the call.\n\nSo what\u2019s accounting for the rest of that growth? In addition to the aforementioned California acquisition, Tenet opened a hospital in New Braunfels. It acquired Texas Regional Medical Center in Sunnyvale. It opened a new Heart Hospital at the Detroit Medical Center and a large emergency room at Sinai-Grace hospital in northwest Detroit.\n\nIt also reached a new contract deal with United Healthcare that will include all former Vanguard Health Systems hospitals and facilities, which became part of Tenet after it bought the Tennessee-based company last year.\n\nAnd Conifer, its Frisco-based health solutions company, is growing as its clients grow. For instance, it manages revenue cycle and business process services for the Colorado-based Catholic Health Initiatives, which has grown by 70 percent since partnering in 2012, and Tenet, which has grown by 60 percent, Fetter said. Conifer is set to bring in $1 billion in revenue this year.\n\n\u201cThis growth is being generated by investments we made in the hospitals, techniques we\u2019re using to make our hospitals more accessible to patients, and IT investments we made to make our care more efficient and less costly,\u201d Fetter said. \u201cIt\u2019s all those things we\u2019ve been doing.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s still room for further growth, as evidenced by metrics in the five states where Tenet has hospitals that have chosen to expand Medicaid. Uninsured and charity admissions there declined 54.3 percent and Medicaid admissions jumped by 22.9 percent. In states that chose not to expand, Medicaid admissions were up by just 3 percent, Fetter said.\n\nIn Texas, the company is turning its attention to the legislature. When it reconvenes in 2015, it will again take up whether to expand Medicaid, a move that would cover an estimated 1 million Texans, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\n\u201cIt would provide a very substantial source of growth if they\u2019re able to do it,\u201d Fetter said. \u201cWhat would need to happen to get any kind of traction to support it is that the ideological argument must take a back seat to the practical argument.\u201d\n\nAs a result of its strong second quarter, Tenet boosted its expected third quarter EBITDA from $400 million to $450 million. It now forecasts $1.95 billion in EBITDA by year\u2019s end, up from $1.85 billion.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "D Healthcare Daily", "description": "Dallas-based Tenet Healthcare Corp. saw its second quarter revenue spike by nearly 40 percent year-over-year, growing in admissions, outpatient visits, surgeries, and emergency visits while also slicing its bad debt as more residents gained access to care.
