Marco Rubio (R-FL) will miss a crucial vote in the U.S. Senate next week. Senate Republicans will try to break the Democrat filibuster of a House-passed bill that funds the entire Department of Homeland Security (DHS) but blocks funding for President Obama\u2019s executive amnesty. Rubio will miss the vote because he\u2019ll be in New Hampshire, testing the waters for a potential presidential campaign.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\n\u201cRubio will be in New Hampshire early next week, where he\u2019s going to miss at least one vote in the Senate on the DHS deadlock,\u201d Politico\u2019s Burgess Everett wrote on Friday morning in the tip sheet email by Politico, Huddle.\n\nRubio\u2019s spokesman Alex Conant confirms that Rubio will miss the vote, since he doesn\u2019t expect it to pass.\n\n\u201cYes, he\u2019s expected to miss the same procedural vote on Monday afternoon that he\u2019s already cast several times already and we know will not pass,\u201d Conant said in an email to Breitbart News.\n\nIt\u2019s not unusual for presidential candidates to miss Senate votes. Senator Rubio has not made a final decision about 2016, but he\u2019s seriously considering running for president and taking the necessary steps to prepare a competitive campaign. As he travels the country meeting with voters, there will be no doubt where he stands on any important issues before the Senate. Regarding the underlying issue: Marco does not and will not support a clean DHS funding bill that does not repeal the Presidents unconstitutional executive order on immigration.\n\nThis comes after a dustup Rubio had during an appearance in Nevada, where he told reporters that Congress should pass a DHS funding bill without conditions on Obama\u2019s executive amnesty.\n\n\u201cWe have to fund Homeland Security,\u201d Rubio said in a news conference there. \u201cWe can\u2019t let Homeland Security shut down.\u201d\n\nRubio could be taken to have said that Congress needs to pass a bill to fund Homeland Security and prevent a partial shutdown if Senate Democrats don\u2019t break their filibuster by February 27. Rubio\u2019s office quickly walked it back, with Conant sending quotes around to reporters saying that what Rubio in fact meant by \u201cwe can\u2019t let homeland security shut down\u201d is that the Democrats must stop their filibuster.\n\nThis all comes after a federal judge in Texas, Judge Andrew S. Hanen, put a hold on Obama\u2019s executive amnesty as potentially illegal. Hanen issued an injunction ordering the administration to immediately halt all implementation plans for the executive amnesty\u2014something the administration has reluctantly agreed to comply with.\n\nWith the Democrats and the administration on defense after Hanen\u2019s ruling, pretty much all Republicans in Congress\u2014including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Speaker John Boehner and Sens. Jeff Sessions (R-AL) and Ted Cruz (R-TX) among scores of rank-and-file members\u2014have publicly pressured the Senate Democrats to drop their support of the Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) created filibuster.\n\nIt remains to be seen what will happen on Monday. But if any Senate Democrats vote with the Republicans against Obama\u2019s executive amnesty\u2014and many of them said they opposed Obama last Fall, even though they haven\u2019t been following through\u2014Rubio would look really badly for not being there to contribute his vote.\n\n\u201cJust when conservatives want to welcome Marco Rubio back into our good graces, he self-immolates over amnesty yet again,\u201d nationally syndicated radio host Steve Deace, who is based in Iowa, told Bretibart News.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rubio To Skip Vote For DHS Funding Bill Blocking Obama Amnesty To Test Presidential Waters In NH", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Rubio To Skip Vote For DHS Funding Bill Blocking Obama Amnesty To Test Presidential Waters In NH", "title": "Rubio To Skip Vote For DHS Funding Bill Blocking Obama Amnesty To Test Presidential Waters In NH - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/Rubio-AP.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/02/20/rubio-to-skip-vote-for-dhs-funding-bill-blocking-obama-amnesty-to-test-presidential-waters-in-nh/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Rubio To Skip Vote For DHS Funding Bill Blocking Obama Amnesty To Test Presidential Waters In NH", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/Rubio-AP.jpg", "title": "Rubio To Skip Vote For DHS Funding Bill Blocking Obama Amnesty To Test Presidential Waters In NH - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "executive amnesty, Federal Judge Andrew Hanen, Marco Rubio, Obama,Big Government, Immigration,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "Obama", "published_time": "2015-02-20T11:15:41-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,Immigration"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd30fc\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe have to fund Homeland Security,\u201d Rubio said in a news conference there.\nRubio will miss the vote because he\u2019ll be in New Hampshire, testing the waters for a potential presidential campaign.\nThis all comes after a federal judge in Texas, Judge Andrew S.
