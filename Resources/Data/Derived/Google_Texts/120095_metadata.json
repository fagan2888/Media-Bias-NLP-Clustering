He did it with the help of the country\u2019s most influential Muslim cleric, Fethullah Gulen (pictured), who lives in self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania but commands a global network of schools, charities and media outlets.\n\nNow Mr Erdogan has turned on his former ally in a show of force that is likely to determine his own future as well as that of Turkish politics. Strange though it seems to many, Mr Gulen is perhaps the only force that can halt Mr Erdogan\u2019s drift towards authoritarianism. He is also credited with keeping Turkish Islam moderate.\n\nWill Mr Gulen mobilise his flock, thought to be in the millions, against Mr Erdogan and his Islamist-leaning Justice and Development (AK) party in the March municipal elections? If so, will their support be enough to wrest Istanbul, the biggest municipal prize, from AK? And what of Mr Erdogan\u2019s dream of becoming Turkey\u2019s first popularly elected president when the post becomes vacant in August?\n\nOpinions differ on the outcome of what Kadri Gursel, a pundit, calls the \u201cugly divorce\u201d. With the levers of power at his disposal, Mr Erdogan might seem the stronger man. He has vowed to phase out thousands of private crammers that prepare students for university exams. A quarter of the schools, a big source of disciples and revenue, are run by Gulenists.\n\nThe decision, announced last month, sparked a barrage of rebukes, including one from Mr Gulen, who inveighed against the tyranny of \u201cpharaohs\u201d. Mr Erdogan has begun to weed out thousands of Gulenists thought to be embedded in the security services, government ministries and judiciary and who, in his words, constitute \u201ca parallel state\u201d. They are rumoured to possess evidence of AK-linked corruption, as well as compromising videos of Mr Erdogan\u2019s associates.\n\nThese \u201cagents\u201d are said to be the source of a steady flow of classified documents to the media, one of them a directive from the national security council with Mr Erdogan\u2019s signature on it which calls for defanging religious groups, including the Gulenists. Prosecutors have begun investigating Mehmet Baransu, the journalist who published the document, on \u201cespionage\u201d charges. Never mind that Mr Baransu was hailed as a hero when he published reams of other sensitive evidence used to convict hundreds of alleged coup-plotting generals and their proxies in the controversial Ergenekon trial. The targeting of Mr Baransu and his newspaper, Taraf, is yet another example of Mr Erdogan\u2019s campaign to muzzle dissident voices.\n\nA source of enduring speculation is why Mr Erdogan has chosen this moment to go after the Gulenists. The most likely answer is that Mr Erdogan wanted them to show their hand well before the presidential elections. An increasingly paranoid prime minister is said to believe that a \u201cGulen-Israel axis\u201d is bent on unseating him. His suspicions were fuelled by Mr Gulen\u2019s very public criticism of Turkey\u2019s rupture with Israel in 2010.\n\nIt is too early to say which of the leaders will prevail. Mr Gulen made some conciliatory noises in his most recent sermon. The latest opinion polls suggest that AK continues to command around 50% in support. People close to Mr Gulen acknowledge that the movement\u2019s image has suffered and that much soul-searching has ensued. Mr Erdogan, who rarely admits to any wrong-doing, ought to follow suit. Turkey would be a happier and more democratic place.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/50_by_50/images/print-edition/20131214_EUP003_0.jpg", "sailthru.flytitle": "Turkish politics", "description": "Who will prevail?", "pubdate": 20131214, "og": {"site_name": "The Economist", "description": "Who will prevail?", "title": "Erdogan v Gulen", "url": "http://www.economist.com/news/europe/21591645-who-will-prevail-erdogan-v-gulen", "image": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20131214_EUP003_0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "sailthru.rubric": "Who will prevail?", "sailthru.date": "1970-01-01 00:00:00", "twitter": {"image": "https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20131214_EUP003_0.jpg", "site": "@TheEconomist", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20131214_EUP003_0.jpg", "revisit-after": "1 day", "sailthru.web_section": "Europe", "fb": {"pages": 6013004059, "app_id": 173277756049645}, "sailthru.imagepath": "images/print-edition/20131214_EUP003_0.jpg", "articleid": 21591645, "sailthru.image.thumb_mfte": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/ec_related_article_image/images/print-edition/20131214_EUP003_0.jpg", "sailthru.tags": "Turkish politics", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theeconomist"}, "sailthru.printdate": "2013-12-14 00:00:00", "news_keywords": "Turkish politics"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd39df\"", "article_summary": "Strange though it seems to many, Mr Gulen is perhaps the only force that can halt Mr Erdogan\u2019s drift towards authoritarianism.\nWill Mr Gulen mobilise his flock, thought to be in the millions, against Mr Erdogan and his Islamist-leaning Justice and Development (AK) party in the March municipal elections?\nPeople close to Mr Gulen acknowledge that the movement\u2019s image has suffered and that much soul-searching has ensued.\nThe most likely answer is that Mr Erdogan wanted them to show their hand well before the presidential elections.\nThe decision, announced last month, sparked a barrage of rebukes, including one from Mr Gulen, who inveighed against the tyranny of \u201cpharaohs\u201d."}
