Greenville, South Carolina (CNN) Jeb Bush said Friday that President Obama hasn't done a good job of promoting his own family as an example for others to follow.

The former Florida governor made the comment as part of a discussion on strengthening families and lifting people out of poverty during the Faith and Family Presidential Forum at Bob Jones University.

"This is a place where I think President Obama missed a real golden opportunity, because he has a stable family, loving children -- great, balanced children from what I can tell -- a strong relationship with his wife, and he could have shown that as a model for others to emulate. And I don't think he's done it as much," Bush said.

Bush, as he often does, said that marriage is one of the keys to keeping people out of poverty, pointing to federal welfare programs that he argues create incentives for single moms to stay single, because otherwise they may lose some benefits.

The former Florida governor laid out parts of his proposal to reform welfare, but also argued that the "public persona of the presidency has power" on this issue as well.
