Churchill\u2019s audience for this speech wasn\u2019t the United Nations or the House of Commons, but the Class of 1946\u2013a group of college seniors at a small college in Missouri near Harry Truman\u2019s hometown. But had the Class of 1946 been like the Class of 2014, Churchill\u2019s famous speech may well have been lost to history.\n\nLast week, 483 Smith College students denied their classmates and families the opportunity to hear from the head of one of the most powerful organizations in the world, continuing a disturbing trend of unaccomplished college students crying petulantly when their school\u2019s commencement speaker holds views that align less than perfectly with their own.\n\nAs head of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde is one of the ten most powerful women in the world, but that apparently doesn\u2019t qualify her to speak at the graduation ceremony at a small women\u2019s college in western Massachusetts. A handful of Smith students, offended by the IMF\u2019s supposed \u201cimperialistic\u201d nature, started a petition to remove Lagarde as their commencement speaker\u2013and despite getting less than halfway to their stated signature goal, they succeeded in upholding the impenetrable bubble of same-mindedness surrounding their campus.\n\nThis came just days after students at Rutgers forced the highest-ranking woman in American history, Condoleezza Rice, from their campus after sit-in protests that would have made 60\u2019s radicals proud.\n\nMillennials may think that acts of defiance like this demonstrate resilience, intellectual independence, or superior morality, but they don\u2019t understand how shortsighted and narrow-minded these protests really are. If young people can\u2019t tolerate listening to an accomplished person with whom they disagree for 45 minutes, they\u2019re in for a rude awakening in the workplace.\n\nProfessional success requires not only talent and hard work, but maturity, and one of the hallmarks of a mature adult is the ability to converse with, and learn from\u2013or at least listen to\u2013people with different points of view.\n\nAs the Class of 2014 trades in their caps and gowns for suits and cubicles, they\u2019ll quickly learn that most successful employees devote more time to forging relationships and building bridges than to blacklisting people they find objectionable.\n\nWhile it\u2019s unlikely that Christine Lagarde or Condoleezza Rice will be showing up at new graduates\u2019 workplaces, many of these noble-minded protesters will be settling into offices with supervisors who hold different political views. They may even have work with clients whose business practices they find objectionable. And in the real world, they won\u2019t simply be able to stamp their feet and make these people disappear. Instead, they\u2019ll have to tolerate philosophical differences\u2013and they may even learn a thing or two in the process.\n\nThe fact that we\u2019re even having this conversation constitutes a major failure on the part of American academia. The role of a university\u2013which comes from the Latin word for \u201cwhole\u201d\u2013has always been to bring together scholars and students in a place where knowledge can be shared and ideas debated. But instead of fostering this culture of tolerant, open-minded thinking, too many colleges and universities are turning out graduates who refuse to consider any perspective other than their own.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "The role of a university--which comes from the Latin word for \u201cwhole\u201d--has always been to bring together scholars and students in a place where knowledge can be shared and ideas debated.", "title": "This year\u2019s graduates still have a lot to learn - Red Alert Politics", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 533, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2014/04/College_graduate_students-533x400.jpg", "height": 400}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2014/05/17/years-graduates-still-lot-learn/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "commencement-protests", "published_time": "2014-05-17T10:52:36+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-05-17T10:52:36+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd306\"", "article_summary": "Instead, they\u2019ll have to tolerate philosophical differences\u2013and they may even learn a thing or two in the process.\nBut had the Class of 1946 been like the Class of 2014, Churchill\u2019s famous speech may well have been lost to history.\nBut instead of fostering this culture of tolerant, open-minded thinking, too many colleges and universities are turning out graduates who refuse to consider any perspective other than their own.\nAnd in the real world, they won\u2019t simply be able to stamp their feet and make these people disappear.\nThe fact that we\u2019re even having this conversation constitutes a major failure on the part of American academia."}
