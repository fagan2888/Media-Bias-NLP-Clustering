"I agree with Sen. Rubio that the president has not been forthcoming with the strategy [in Syria]," Bush said during an interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt.

A simmering rivalry between the Floridians spilled into the open last week.

Rubio, who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and has advocated stronger engagement in Syria, voted against authorizing military action there in 2013.

The situation in Syria has since emerged as a top challenge facing the Obama administration as it battles Islamic militants while hoping to see President Bashar Assad’s regime go.

Rubio defended his vote during the second GOP presidential debate last month, saying the U.S. had "zero responsibility" in the country and pushing back against the idea of a "pinprick attacks."

"We are not going to authorize use of force if you are not putting men and women in a position where they can win," Rubio said during the debate.

Bush pushed back on that Thursday, saying that while President Obama's request for military force in 2013 was "pretty tepid," Congress should have supported it.

"I think at that point, it wasn't popular amongst some parts of the Republican party, and I think people were sticking their fingers in the breeze, and that's wrong," Bush said.

"I thought that that vote was uncalled for. We should support the president, because that was better than inaction. The lack of action now creates chaos."
