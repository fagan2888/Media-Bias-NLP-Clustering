Despite being touted as the “most transparent administration in history,” the Obama administration has a habit of hiding legislative and regulatory decisions in the midst of popular controversy and when everyone is distracted by the hustle and bustle of the holidays.

It seems they have no intention on breaking this most sacred of Obama traditions, with plans to quietly enact 3,415 regulations right before the Thanksgiving celebrations.

Many have become frustrated with this habit, The Hill reports:

“’It’s become an unfortunate tradition of this administration and others to drop these regulatory agendas late on a Friday and right before a holiday,’ said Matt Shudtz, executive director of the Center for Progressive Reform. It’s unfortunate because it’s an update on protections for Americans of all stripes. It lays out the administration’s plan and it deserves more attention.’”

These regulations include provisions for EPA greenhouse emissions standards, FDA tobacco regulations on distribution and advertising, furniture flammability standards (yeah…), and many others.

This is not the first time this year that this has happened, as the administration released their spring 2014 regulatory agenda right before Memorial Day.

Also, just recently, amid all the fuss over immigration, the Obama administration released an executive order, which extends direct combat roles of troops in Afghanistan through to 2015, despite the President’s promises to pull out combat troops this year.

Unfortunately, this type of secretive and surprising behavior has been typical of this administration. Affordable Care Act, anyone?
