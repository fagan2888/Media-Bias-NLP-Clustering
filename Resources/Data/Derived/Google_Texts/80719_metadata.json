There are several English translations; Thunder Rolling Down the Mountain is one. He became known as Joseph the Younger. His father had been given the name Joseph when he was baptized at the Lapwai mission in 1838. Joseph the Younger later became Chief Joseph, a name recognized across the country during and after the Nez Perce War of 1877.\n\nHis home, like his family before him, was in the Wallowa Mountains of eastern Oregon. As chief of this band he struggled to maintain their homeland against the surge of miners and homesteaders who flocked west. That struggle came to a head in 1877 when he was forced to leave his homeland for the reservation along the Clearwater River in Idaho\u2014or attempt to move elsewhere to avoid fighting the U.S. Army. Unfortunately the Army wouldn\u2019t accept that. In the summer of 1877 war broke out despite the attempts of Chief Joseph and many others to avoid it.\n\nThe first battle was at White Bird, near the Salmon River in Idaho, when U.S. Army troops charged from the hills only to be thoroughly defeated by Nez Perce warriors. Then came battles on the Clearwater River, the Big Hole in Montana, Camas Meadows, and ultimately at the Bear Paw in northern Montana only a couple of days walk from the Canadian border and hoped-for safety from U.S. troops.\n\nChief Joseph was never considered a war chief, but rather a spokesman. Others took the war leader role including his brother Olikut. National newspapers became fixated on Chief Joseph and he became a hero to many who were sympathetic to the Nez Perce. He was often referred to by the press as \u201cthe Red Napoleon.\u201d It was Chief Joseph who gave the surrender speech at Bear Paw. \u201cI am tired of fighting\u2026 It is cold, and we have no blankets... The little children are freezing to death... My heart is sick and sad. From where the sun now stands I will fight no more forever.\u201d\n\nHe was promised that his band could return to the Wallowa Mountains, but that promise was broken. They were first sent to Kansas and later to swampy bottomlands in Oklahoma, Ee-i-kish Paw, the hot place. Deaths here rivaled those during the war.\n\nThe government eventually relocated the survivors to northern Washington on the Colville reservation.\n\nHis fame allowed him to meet with U.S. President Rutherford B. Hayes in 1879 to request that the promise made by the Army to return them to Oregon would be permitted, but was again rejected.\n\nChief Joseph was an eloquent speaker and in his later years he continued to speak out against the injustices of U.S. policies against Indian people, asking that Native Americans be given the same equality and freedom as other Americans.\n\nOn September 21, 1904 he was laid to rest at Nespelem, Washington on the Colville Reservation. According to his doctor he died of a broken heart.\n\nRELATED: Nez Perce Unveil Chief Joseph Statue", "article_metadata": {"description": "On September 21, 1904 Chief Joseph passed away on the Colville Reservation in Washington, never returning to his homeland in the Wallowa Mountains.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "leeanne", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2013/09/21/native-history-nez-perce-leader-chief-joseph-walks-151234", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/uploads/2012/07/Chief-Joseph-Nez-Perce1-e1341872045622.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Native History: Nez Perce Leader Chief Joseph Walks On"}, "dcterms.date": "2013-09-21T13:00-04:00", "dc": {"title": "Native History: Nez Perce Leader Chief Joseph Walks On"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2013/09/21/native-history-nez-perce-leader-chief-joseph-walks-151234", "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Chief Joseph, Nez Perce, Oregon, Native American History, Colville Indian Reservation", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.title": "Native History: Nez Perce Leader Chief Joseph Walks On"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd874d\"", "article_summary": "Joseph the Younger later became Chief Joseph, a name recognized across the country during and after the Nez Perce War of 1877.\nNational newspapers became fixated on Chief Joseph and he became a hero to many who were sympathetic to the Nez Perce.\nChief Joseph was never considered a war chief, but rather a spokesman.\nRELATED: Nez Perce Unveil Chief Joseph Statue\nHe was often referred to by the press as \u201cthe Red Napoleon.\u201d It was Chief Joseph who gave the surrender speech at Bear Paw."}
