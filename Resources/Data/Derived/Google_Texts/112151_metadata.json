You can see the list of those Republicans who voted for this betrayal of conservative principles in the Republican List of Shame below.\n\nNo doubt many of those on the Republican List of Shame will claim the bill has all kinds of prohibitions on more spending or that it cuts government waste.\n\nThat is, to put it politely, a lot of baloney.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, as Amanda Carpenter senior communications adviser to Senator Ted Cruz pointed out in a series of Tweets, many Capitol Hill staffers haven\u2019t even read the bill and laughed about the whole idea of knowing what was in it before their bosses voted on it.\n\nHere are a few of the wasteful and extra-constitutional programs and earmarks the Republicans on the List of Shame below voted for:\n\n\u00b7 Funding U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) advertising programs for food stamps in foreign countries like Mexico.\n\n\u00b7 $35 million for the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), an organization believed to be involved in China\u2019s coercive one-child policy of forced abortions and involuntary sterilizations.\n\n\u00b7 Funding for the implementation of Obamacare, including elective abortion coverage.\n\n\u00b7 Earmarking Export-Import Bank funds for \u201cgreen energy.\u201d\n\n\u00b7 The National Endowment for the Arts and National Endowment for the Humanities.\n\n\u00b7 Over $34 million to pay salaries and expenses for the supposedly terminated TARP program (Troubled Asset Relief Program) that bailed-out Wall Street and foreign banks.\n\nAnd of course there will be more revelations of waste, earmarks and extra-constitutional spending when Americans do actually get to review the 1,582-page $1.012 trillion spending bill.\n\nHere\u2019s the Republican List of Shame of
