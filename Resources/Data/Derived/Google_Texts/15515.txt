The location of an old smelter in Pueblo that hasn’t been working for nearly a century but has left behind elevated levels of lead and arsenic should be listed as Colorado’s next Superfund site.

Pueblo City Council members and county commissioners on Dec. 31 sent a letter to Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper asking him to send a letter to the Environmental Protection Agency in support of listing the old Colorado Smelter site on the EPA’s national priority list.

The site should be considered so a federally backed cleanup can begin, and we hope Hickenlooper agrees.

A 2010 survey of the area by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment found contamination in slag piles, residential soils and surface water.

“People who live in these areas are routinely exposed to these toxic metals and are subjected to a number of immediate and long-term negative health consequences, including brain and nervous system damage and increased cancer risk,” according to the letter.

Community support for listing is a step in the federal process to establish and implement cleanup plans for abandoned hazardous waste sites.

The public will have plenty of opportunity to comment on the process, including a 60-day period after the proposal is published in the Federal Register.

If everything goes smoothly, the area could be listed as a Superfund site in nine months. The sooner the better.
