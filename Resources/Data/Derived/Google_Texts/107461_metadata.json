Doctor Marlow Hernandez, a refugee from Cuba who\u2019s become a highly successful practitioner in South Florida after arriving penniless, decided this week that he wanted to give back.\n\nCano Health Center opened its doors to anyone making less than $20,000 a year, or families making less than $40,000. The aim was to offer medical care to patients without insurance, but a funny thing happened.\n\nThe center became swamped. It was packed not only with uninsured patients, but with insured patients as well. The better term is one I suspect we\u2019ll be hearing more and more in the coming year \u2014 \u201cunderinsured.\u201d\n\nToo many patients still don\u2019t know where to turn, and often end up desperate and confused, while their doctors grow more and more frustrated. - Rick Sanchez\n\nWhat is underinsured? It\u2019s a problem more and more of America\u2019s doctors are now seeing for themselves as the Affordable Care Act kicks, or better yet, lags into second gear. To be fair, there are now more Americans who are insured, but it\u2019s often with an insurance policy that doesn\u2019t provide them quality medical care.\n\nThe culprit: that insufferable and unavoidable mandate we\u2019ve all come to know as the \u201cmedical deductible.\u201d Fact is, many patients are now foregoing doctor\u2019s visits for fear of having to pay thousands of dollars in up-front deductibles they simply can\u2019t afford. What\u2019s worse is that many are foregoing procedures they may need to lead healthier lives ... or more importantly to avoid catastrophic illnesses.\n\nTake the case of Samantha. (We\u2019re not using her real name to protect her privacy.) She hasn\u2019t seen a doctor or had even gotten a check-up in two years. She couldn\u2019t afford it, which is why she took advantage of \u201cfree health care day\u201d at the Cano Medical Facility.\n\n\u201cIt broke my heart to have to tell her what I found,\u201d said Dr. Hernandez. \u201cShe has an abdominal mass the size of a baseball just below her abdomen. If it\u2019s malignant and aggressive, it may not be survivable.\u201d\n\nSamantha is not alone. Like her, there are tens of thousands of patients who are uninsured or, doctors argue, they are \u201cjust as apt to be underinsured\u201d because of Obamacare.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an act of charity and I\u2019m glad we were able to do it,\u201d said Hernandez, who is both board certified in internal medicine and also holds a Master\u2019s Degree in Public Health. \u201cI never expected to find such need.\u201d\n\nAccording to Hernandez, it\u2019s the extent of the conditions and illnesses that he treated that surprised him:\n\n- A woman in her 20s who thought she was pregnant but couldn\u2019t afford an obstetrician. She was right and was in fact more than 36 weeks along.\n\n- A man in his 60s who says he\u2019s been in so much pain for weeks he didn\u2019t know where to turn. His diagnosis: shingles.\n\n- Another man in his 40s presented with severe pain in his back. The immigrant worker described himself as \u201ctoo busy taking care of my family to find a doctor.\u201d He was diagnosed and treated for what appears to be a gall bladder disease.\n\n- A woman in her 30s came with her two children. She was one of many who arrived with kids. The family had issues from diabetes to anemia. And the mom showed risk factors for a stroke.\n\n- A man in his late 40s could not quit smoking and was paying the price as an asthmatic. He was crying for help and wanted to quit for his grandchildren. He was treated, given inhalers and medication and left with what seemed newfound hope.\n\nWe cannot share the names of the patients who were willing to tell us their stories, in fact some of their data has been altered slightly to further protect their identities, but unfortunately they represent a cast of millions. There are still tens of millions of Americans who remain outside the massive bubble that is America\u2019s overly fragmented health care system.\n\nToo many patients still don\u2019t know where to turn, and often end up desperate and confused, while their doctors grow more and more frustrated. Thousands of doctors around the country \u2013doctors like Marlow Hernandez \u2013 are trying to make a difference.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a doctor, we want to help patients,\u201d says Hernandez. \u201cBut most of all, we want to help create a better system that allows all Americans to get quality health care.\u201d\n\nBut as of now, says Hernandez, \u201cwe\u2019re simply still not there.\u201d\n\nRick Sanchez is a contributor for Fox News Latino.\n\nLike us on Facebook\n\nFollow us on Twitter & Instagram", "article_metadata": {"classification": "LANGUAGES/English", "dcterms.modified": "2015-07-16 10:17:15 EDT", "dcterms.abstract": "American health care, still broken after Obamacare", "twitter": {"image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/global.fncstatic.com/static/managed/img/fn-latino/news/0/0/3182223.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "site": "@foxnewslatino", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@foxnewslatino"}, "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.publisher": "Fox News Latino", "parsely-metadata": "{\"title\":\"Rick Sanchez: American health care, still broken after Obamacare\",\"link\":\"http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/opinion/2015/07/16/rick-sanchez-american-health-care-still-broken-after-obamacare/\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/global.fncstatic.com/static/managed/img/fn-latino/news/0/0/3182223.jpg?ve=1&tl=1\",\"type\":\"article\",\"identifier\":\"ec8c8205c179e410VgnVCM100000d7c1a8c0RCRD\",\"section\":\"opinion\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-07-16T14:17:15Z\",\"author\":\"Rick Sanchez\",\"tags\":[\"LANGUAGES/English\"]}", "prism.aggregationType": "front", "keywords": "Cuba,internal medicine,Medical Facility,medical care,Health Center,Florida,healthier lives,Public Health,quit smoking,Affordable Care Act,South Florida,risk factors,immigrant worker", "prism.channel": "fnl", "dc.description": "American health care, still broken after Obamacare", "dc.identifier": "urn:uuid:ec8c8205c179e410VgnVCM100000d7c1a8c0RCRD", "pagetype": "article", "dc.subject": "Cuba,internal medicine,Medical Facility,medical care,Health Center,Florida,healthier lives,Public Health,quit smoking,Affordable Care Act,South Florida,risk factors,immigrant worker", "description": "El gigante de Redmond podr\u00eda lanzar dos nuevos modelos de Xbox One que llegar\u00edan al mercado en los pr\u00f3ximos dos a\u00f1os, seg\u00fan reporta Kotaku.
