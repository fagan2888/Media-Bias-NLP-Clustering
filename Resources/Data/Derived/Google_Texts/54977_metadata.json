By Ernie Smith / Feb 25, 2015 (iStock/Thinkstock) (iStock/Thinkstock)\n\nThe Empire State\u2019s plan to increase the minimum wage for tipped workers to $7.50\u2014one of the highest in the country\u2014has the New York State Restaurant Association suggesting that its members could consider doing away with tips altogether.\n\nCould higher wages for tipped workers mean the end of gratuities in New York?\n\nThat\u2019s one of the dangers that restaurant employees see as New York mandates a new minimum wage for tipped workers. Although the state\u2019s current minimum for these workers\u2014$4.90, $5, or $5.65 per hour, depending on wage class\u2014is already above the federal rate of $2.13, the acting commissioner of the state\u2019s Labor Department announced this week that he would follow recommendations to increase the wage to $7.50 at the end of 2015. That\u2019s below the standard $9 minimum wage in New York, but it amounts to a 50 percent increase for a large segment of the labor market.\n\n\u201cAfter receiving testimony divided between those in favor of eliminating the tip credit and those opposed to any change, I believe this recommendation strikes the proper balance,\u201d Acting Commissioner of Labor Mario Musolino wrote in a statement on the decision. \u201cIt increases wages for those who have been without a raise for far too long and completes the goal that was postponed in 2009 of establishing a single rate for all tipped workers.\u201d\n\nThe New York State Restaurant Association (NYSRA), which opposed the wage change, noted that Musolino\u2019s decision seemed to disregard appeals from the hospitality industry that he take less drastic action.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s troubling that the acting commissioner ignored legislative precedent and the pleas of nearly 1,000 hospitality-industry representatives who asked him for a moderate increase phased in over time,\u201d NYSRA President and CEO Melissa Fleischut said in a statement. \u201cBy rubber-stamping an extreme, unprecedented 50 percent increase, it becomes hard to believe New York is really \u2018open for business.\u2019\u201d\n\nAre Tips Done For?\n\nIn a follow-up post in the members-only section of its website, NYSRA noted that it has limited legal recourse [member login required] against the change but is exploring its options. It added that restaurants do have choices in how they handle the pay bump\u2014and one of those is to get rid of tips altogether.\n\n\u201cAs far as options for your business go, come the first of next year you will have two options: Pay all tipped workers $7.50 per hour, or pay all employees full minimum wage and move away from the tipping system,\u201d the association stated.\n\nA recent NPR report noted that restaurants in New York City have already been experimenting with new wage models, including some that rely on a no-tip policy and, in one case, a 20 percent fee on customers\u2019 bills that goes toward employees\u2019 salaries.\n\nNYSRA cautioned restaurants to take care if they add fees to bills, noting that \u201cit is legally risky because of the complex regulations regarding auto-gratuities.\u201d If restaurants do choose that approach, it recommends using an \u201cadministrative fee,\u201d part of which can go to management, rather than a \u201cservice charge,\u201d which must go to employees.\n\nShare this article", "article_metadata": {"description": "A plan to increase the minimum wage for tipped workers to $7.50 has the New York State Restaurant Association suggesting its members could consider dropping tips.", "pocket-site-verification": "f7059b70f081a1e1ced322fc1d9787", "og": {"site_name": "Associations Now", "description": "A plan to increase the minimum wage for tipped workers to $7.50 has the New York State Restaurant Association suggesting its members could consider dropping tips.", "title": "Could New York Minimum Wage Boost End Tipping?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://associationsnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/0225_tipping.jpg", "url": "http://associationsnow.com/2015/02/could-new-york-minimum-wage-boost-end-tipping/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Associations Now", "description": "A plan to increase the minimum wage for tipped workers to $7.50 has the New York State Restaurant Association suggesting its members could consider dropping tips.", "title": "Could New York Minimum Wage Boost End Tipping?", "image": "http://associationsnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/0225_tipping.jpg", "creator": "@associationsnow", "site": "@associationsnow", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"admins": 502961619}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/AssociationsNow", "section": "Uncategorized", "published_time": "2015-02-25T16:50:32+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Money & Business, Membership, tipped workers"}, "article_summary": "Could New York Minimum Wage Boost End Tipping?\nThat\u2019s one of the dangers that restaurant employees see as New York mandates a new minimum wage for tipped workers.\nThat\u2019s below the standard $9 minimum wage in New York, but it amounts to a 50 percent increase for a large segment of the labor market.\nCould higher wages for tipped workers mean the end of gratuities in New York?\n\u201cAs far as options for your business go, come the first of next year you will have two options: Pay all tipped workers $7.50 per hour, or pay all employees full minimum wage and move away from the tipping system,\u201d the association stated."}
