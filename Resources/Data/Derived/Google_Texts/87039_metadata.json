Under the terms of that pact, Georgia agreed to establish community services for about 9,000 people with mental illness, and to create community support and crisis intervention teams to help people with developmental disabilities and mental illness avoid hospitalization.\n\nAs part of the settlement, Georgia pledged to end all admissions of people with developmental disabilities to state psychiatric hospitals. It also promised that patients with developmental disabilities already in those hospitals would be moved to more appropriate settings by July 2015.\n\nBut problems involved in the care delivered in these community living situations led DBHDD to stop transferring people with developmental disabilities from hospitals to community lodgings. Over the summer, media outlets reported that almost 10 percent of the 480 Georgians with developmental disabilities who have moved out of state hospitals since July 2010 have died after being placed in community residences.\n\nAbout 290 people with developmental disabilities remain in the state\u2019s institutions in Augusta, Milledgeville and Atlanta.\n\nThose transitions from hospital to community are still suspended, DBHDD officials said Wednesday. \u201cWe\u2019re reviewing all the processes,\u2019\u2019 said Judy Fitzgerald, deputy commissioner of the agency.\n\nAnd earlier this month, GHN reported that a federal agency has warned Georgia officials that it would end Medicaid payments to an Augusta facility for the developmentally disabled unless the state improved conditions there.\n\nThe federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), in an August report, said the state-run Gracewood Developmental Center had repeatedly failed to ensure the safety of patients, who had been subjected to physical and verbal abuse.\n\nThe feds also described inadequate employee training and frequent failure to investigate possible instances of abuse.\n\nFitzgerald told GHN on Wednesday that CMS has accepted the state\u2019s plan of correction for Gracewood, and that an interim hospital administrator has been hired to oversee the improvements.\n\nDBHDD, meanwhile, is overhauling its processes regarding people with developmental disabilities whom it serves as part of an agency restructuring.\n\nEric Jacobson, executive director of the Georgia Council on Developmental Disabilities, said earlier this month that he welcomes the agency overhaul.\n\n\u201cThey have to rethink the way things are being done,\u201d Jacobson said. \u201cThese are the most vulnerable of folks.\u201d\n\nPossible extension?\n\nDuring the course of the settlement agreement, crisis services for people with mental illness have been created and expanded, Fitzgerald said. \u201cWe feel like we\u2019ve made substantial progress,\u2019\u2019 she said.\n\nOn supported employment, the state is serving twice the number of people as required under the federal agreement, the agency noted.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of success stories,\u2019\u2019 Talley Wells, director of the Disability Integration Project at Atlanta Legal Aid, told GHN. \u201cThe mental health system, for people in crisis, is much more robust and has solid supports for people.\u201d\n\nThe mental health system still needs more housing for individuals, and more work should be done for people who are in the forensic system, Wells said. These are people who may have been found not guilty by reason of insanity, or judged unfit to stand trial.\n\nJones, in her report, said that \u201cindividuals with forensic histories are not obtaining adequate access to community-based supports. As a result, they remain confined in institutions or are at risk of recidivism upon their release from custodial care. A significant part of this problem rests with discharge practices in jails and other forensic settings.\u201d\n\nWells said it\u2019s possible the agreement could be extended beyond the July deadline, to resolve the problems in the developmental disabilities area.\n\n\u201cWe have not built up a sufficient infrastructure to welcome these people with developmental disabilities\u201d into community living arrangements, he said.\n\nDBHDD announced last week that it has awarded a contract to ValueOptions to help the agency with administrative functions, including data management.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s state-of-the-art technology to help get people to the right care at the right time, factoring in their history\u2019\u2019 of services, Fitzgerald said.\n\nThe new technology system will reduce the administrative burden for medical providers, she said.\n\nEnjoy Georgia Health News?
