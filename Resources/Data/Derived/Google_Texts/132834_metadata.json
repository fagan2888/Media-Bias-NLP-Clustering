In Georgia, it\u2019s up 12.9 percent. In North Carolina, the rate has climbed 12.4 percent.\n\nNone of those states opted to expand their Medicaid programs as part of the Affordable Care Act, but all have seen substantial enrollment increases in state health insurance.\n\nMedicaid Is Growing in Many States That Didn\u2019t Expand The Obamacare law didn\u2019t make anyone new eligible for these states\u2019 Medicaid programs, but the publicity around the act encouraged more people to sign up.

That\u2019s what appears to have happened with the Affordable Care Act. Even though state policy wasn\u2019t changing everywhere, all the talk about new health insurance options and the resources devoted to helping people sign up led to a surge among people who had always been eligible for the program.\n\nAltogether, enrollment in the nonexpansion group of states has increased by 6.8 percent, or about 1.5 million people.\n\nOf course, the increases in states that have expanded Medicaid are more extreme. In Kentucky, the state with the biggest increase, the Medicaid rolls have grown by 71 percent. Overall, states that expanded Medicaid saw substantially larger reductions in the number of people without health insurance. If every state had expanded, we could expect many more people to be insured through the program. (Using data from the advocacy group Enroll America and the data firm Civis Analytics, my colleague Kevin Quealy created a map of what the country would look like if that had happened.)\n\nThis week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published the results of a detailed survey of American households this year. It found a 3.4 percentage point reduction in the number of adults under 65 lacking health insurance between 2013 and the second quarter of this year. Its findings are not a surprise \u2014 earlier, private polls had shown similar drops. But because of its sample size and methods, the CDC study is the most reliable sign yet that millions more Americans have gotten health insurance this year.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Medicaid enrollment increases in these nonexpansion states show us one of the ways that the federal health law has led to those reductions.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20141218183848, "twitter": {"description": "The states that did not expand their programs saw increases in enrollment, and the states that did saw even more.
