A series of videos documented Planned Parenthood officials discussing the harvesting of aborted fetal body parts and compensation for their donation.\n\nPlanned Parenthood has repeatedly said it did not break any laws. It is illegal for the organization to profit from the sale of such fetal tissue, but Planned Parenthood claimed it was just reimbursed for costs such as transporation.\n\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Days after drone strike, U.S. hopes new Taliban leader open to talks Just days after a U.S. drone strike killed the Taliban's leader in Pakistan, the State Department said it's hopeful the Taliban's new leader is open to engaging in peace talks. Over the weekend, a U.S. drone strike killed Mullah Mohammed Akhtar Mansour, and the group replaced him with Mawlawi Haibatullah Akhundzada. But State Department spokesman Mark Toner said the strike against Mansour was ordered because of fear of an imminent strike he was planning. \"The strike against Mansour was based on both his previous actions but also his intent to carry out additional strikes, not only against Afghan forces but against U.S. military forces on the ground in Afghanistan,\" Toner said.\n\nRepublicans said the eventual defeat wasn't the point of the reconciliation bill. It was partly to show that they can repeal Obamacare should a Republican win the White House this year.\n\n\"With a Republican president there is a clear path to repealing Obamacare without needing 60 votes in the United States Senate,\" Ryan said said during a signing ceremony Thursday.\n\nNow discussion will turn to whether Republicans can put together a replacement plan for Obamacare. Republicans said Thursday they aim to pursue patient-centered and common-sense reforms.\n\n\u2022 This article, originally published at 12:11 p.m., has been updated.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In a widely expected move, President Obama vetoed a bill that would gut major pillars of Obamacare and defund Planned Parenthood.\nThe bill was the first to reach the president that would have repealed his signature domestic achievement.
