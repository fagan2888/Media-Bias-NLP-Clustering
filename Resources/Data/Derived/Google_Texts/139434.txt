Jorge De La Rosa, who will miss the first part of the season with a groin injury, likely won’t return until later in the month.

The Rockies were hoping for an April 14 return for their No. 1 pitcher, for a game at San Francisco. That’s the first day Colorado needs a fifth starter in their rotation.

But Rockies manager Walt Weiss said that is not likely.

“That would be absolute best-case scenario,” Weiss said. “But we don’t count on best-case scenarios.”

De La Rosa will pitch a bullpen session Sunday as part of his rehab. His spring training preparation was delayed twice by a strained left groin. Now the left-hander likely needs an extended spring training game and at least one minor-league start before he’s ready to return to the Rockies.

Weiss said he was encouraged by De La Rosa’s progress. But he’s prepared to find another starting pitcher when the five-man rotation kicks in.

Christian Bergman would likely replace De La Rosa. Weiss confirmed that Bergman, a second-year righty who will be on the 25-man roster on opening day in the bullpen, is an option.
