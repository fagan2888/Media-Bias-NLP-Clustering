[Tulsa River Parks Authority]\n\nThe Tulsa River Parks Authority awarded an $839,547 bid Thursday morning to repair Zink Dam's three 50-foot gates on the Arkansas River.\n\nThe dam is located next to the pedestrian bridge at 29th Street.\n\nThe low bidder was Timco Blasting and Coatings of Bristow.\n\nJanet Kendall, Administrative Manager for the authority, said Timco is hoping to begin work within the next month. She said the company will coordinate with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and Southwest Power because of water releases upstream at Keystone Dam.\n\nDepending upon weather conditions, Kendall said the project could take up to a year to complete.\n\nTimco plans to use an inflatable coffer dam while working on the gates.\n\nKendall says this is the first time this type of repair has been done to the gates since the dam was completed in 1983. The hydraulic cylinders that operate the gates have been replaced twice, most recently a couple of years ago.\n\nPlans call for the two gates on the east side of the dam to be repaired first.\n\nThe work is funded by a partnership among Tulsa River Parks Authority, the City of Tulsa, Tulsa County and Public Service Company of Oklahoma.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "At its meeting Thursday, the Tulsa River Parks Authority awarded an $839,547 bid to make repairs to the Zink Dam's three 50-foot gates on the Arkansas River.", "author": "Russell Hulstine", "og": {"url": "http://www.newson6.com/story/23416033/bid-awarded-for-tulsa-zink-dam-gates-repair", "image": "http://KOTV.images.worldnow.com/images/23416033_SA.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "At its meeting Thursday, the Tulsa River Parks Authority awarded an $839,547 bid to make repairs to the Zink Dam's three 50-foot gates on the Arkansas River.", "title": "Bid Awarded For Repairs To Tulsa's Zink Dam Gates"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KOTV.images.worldnow.com/images/23416033_SA.jpg", "description": "At its meeting Thursday, the Tulsa River Parks Authority awarded an $839,547 bid to make repairs to the Zink Dam's three 50-foot gates on the Arkansas River.", "card": "summary", "title": "Bid Awarded For Repairs To Tulsa's Zink Dam Gates"}, "wnreadableurl": "bid-awarded-for-tulsa-zink-dam-gates-repair", "ROBOTS": "Index,Follow,NoArchive", "owner": "KOTV", "fb": {"app_id": 497059410331845}, "date": "2013/09/12", "KEYWORDS": "tulsa,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,kotv.com,channel 6,channel six,green country,television,the news on 6,the news on six,six in the morning,live", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS26", "verify-v1": "67+ifqPKEX7ZTB2sopjxTD1c6nx6ScxupNN92EqnIpc=", "news_keywords": "tulsa,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,kotv.com,channel 6,channel six,green country,television,the news on 6,the news on six,six in the morning,live"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcc71\"", "article_summary": "[Tulsa River Parks Authority]The Tulsa River Parks Authority awarded an $839,547 bid Thursday morning to repair Zink Dam's three 50-foot gates on the Arkansas River.\nThe work is funded by a partnership among Tulsa River Parks Authority, the City of Tulsa, Tulsa County and Public Service Company of Oklahoma.\n[Tulsa River Parks Authority]Plans call for the two gates on the east side of Zink Dam to be repaired first.\n[Tulsa River Parks Authority]Zink Dam is located next to the pedestrian bridge at 29th Street.\nOfficials say this is the first time this type of repairs has been done to the gates."}
