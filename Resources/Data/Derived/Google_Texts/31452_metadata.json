Meanwhile, the federal government could offer catastrophic care coverage akin to the National Flood Insurance Program, paid for with taxes on insurers' profits.\n\nHe has called for government regulators to determine \u2014 \"with the help of medical professionals\" \u2014 what providers can charge for care, ensuring \"fair and consistent\" payments \"throughout the country.\"\n\nOnce he declared his candidacy, Carson said he'd scrap Medicare and Medicaid \u2014 two longtime targets of conservatives \u2014 and spend the money instead on giving every American $2,000 a year for a health savings account. Then he hedged and said Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries could choose whether they wanted the stipend or their existing government coverage, though he has not explained how to pay for both structures at once.\n\nNow, three months from when Iowa and New Hampshire voters cast ballots, Carson's campaign is promising a policy announcement that will clarify just where the candidate stands on health care. \"Once we issue our paper, there will be no more questions,\" said Carson adviser Doug Watts.\n\nCarson's posture on health policy is an ideological mishmash that highlights his unconventional style, which he's ridden to the top of several national and early-state polls. Yet it also raises questions about whether Carson can sustain that strong standing as he draws more scrutiny in a deep field.\n\nHis rivals have yet to criticize his health-care record aggressively, but at least one prominent conservative group has taken notice \u2014 the same organization whose super PAC has spent $1 million in Iowa going after another GOP front-runner, businessman Donald Trump, for supporting tax increases and the use of eminent domain for private development.\n\nClub for Growth accuses Carson of \"philosophical fuzzy-mindedness\" and says many of his health care ideas \"come straight out of the left's playbook.\"\n\nDavid McIntosh, the group's president, said Club for Growth's PAC has no plans to advertise against Carson, but he said Carson's record makes it \"seem like he'd still be learning on the job\" if he were elected.\n\n\"We've wondered, does he have an appreciation for how a market works and whether people benefit from competition?\" McIntosh said.\n\nWatts said Carson has always been consistent in arguing that government and the insurance industry together have acted as inappropriate \"middle men\" between providers and patients. He said any Carson policy would curtail that with a \"nuanced approach.\"\n\nCarson's previous statements on health care are indeed nuanced.\n\nIn a 2012 book, \"America the Beautiful,\" he cited his Christian faith \u2014 \"every time Jesus arrived in a new area, he first healed the sick\" \u2014 in arguing that society \"perhaps\" should \"make sure that the basic needs of the most helpless among us are taken care of.\" He said the rest of the population \u2014 including people of modest means \u2014 should pay something for their care.\n\nHe delighted conservatives in 2013 when he declared: \"Obamacare is really I think the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery.\" And his proposal for health care savings accounts is standard fare among Republicans advocating \"free-market\" health insurance policy.\n\nYet the subsidies he has proposed for health savings accounts could end up as another version of existing subsidies that, under Obama's health care law, help working-class citizens buy private coverage. The question, McIntosh argues, is whether Carson would, in turn, try to dictate coverage standards of private policies, as Obama's law does.\n\nSome of Carson's commentary on insurers echoes criticisms Obama used in arguing for the 2010 law.\n\nCarson has blamed for-profit insurers for squeezing out providers' ability to offer more indigent care because hospitals and physicians spend so much money getting claims paid by insurance firms, which give providers low reimbursements. \"Insurance companies call the shots on what they want to pay, to whom, and when,\" Carson wrote in 2012.\n\nBefore he was a declared politician, Carson acknowledged that his views defy Washington's typical ideological and partisan wrangle.\n\n\"Who is right?\" Carson wrote three years before his campaign. \"Those who feel that it is our moral obligation to treat everyone regardless of cost, or those who feel that rationing and other means of cost containment make more sense.\"\n\nCarson went on: \"As with virtually all controversial issues, the answer usually lies somewhere in between, and compromise can be very helpful.\"\n\nCarson supporter Paige Mitts, a Georgia financial planner who worked previously in health care administration, said Carson's statements do not worry her. \"He's trying to solve complicated problems,\" she said. \"Maybe we should consider it a good thing that he's hard to put in an ideological box.\"", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Ben Carson sometimes deviates from Republican health care thought", "date": "2015-11-16", "Description": "Ben Carson sometimes deviates from Republican health care thought", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The Morning Call", "author": "The Morning Call", "og": {"site_name": "themorningcall.com", "description": "ATLANTA \u2014 Ben Carson lambastes \" Obamacare \" as much as the next Republican presidential candidate, but the neurosurgeon-turned-politician has a history of health care ideas that puts him outside mainstream conservative thought on the issue.", "title": "Ben Carson sometimes deviates from Republican health care thought", "url": "http://www.mcall.com/news/local/elections/mc-ben-carson-obamacare-2016-20151116-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-564a40e7/turbine/mc-ben-carson-obamacare-2016-20151116", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp05.14", "twitter": {"site": "@mcall", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=501096172, app-argument=http://www.mcall.com/deeplinkid/85053945", "fb": {"admins": 1762506491, "page_id": 73291032902, "app_id": 377275452340817}, "googlebot-news": "index", "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "y_key": "7164478e9f100cbd", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "googlebot": "index"}, "article_summary": "And his proposal for health care savings accounts is standard fare among Republicans advocating \"free-market\" health insurance policy.\nCarson supporter Paige Mitts, a Georgia financial planner who worked previously in health care administration, said Carson's statements do not worry her.\nClub for Growth accuses Carson of \"philosophical fuzzy-mindedness\" and says many of his health care ideas \"come straight out of the left's playbook.\"\nYet the subsidies he has proposed for health savings accounts could end up as another version of existing subsidies that, under Obama's health care law, help working-class citizens buy private coverage.\nATLANTA \u2014 Ben Carson lambastes \"Obamacare\" as much as the next Republican presidential candidate, but the neurosurgeon-turned-politician has a history of health care ideas that puts him outside mainstream conservative thought on the issue."}
