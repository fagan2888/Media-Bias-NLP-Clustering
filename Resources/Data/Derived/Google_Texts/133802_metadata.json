If they left the buyer\u2019s family, they would have to go to a museum.\n\nAmong the few dozen who made the cut were the late Leonard and Marjorie Vernon, prominent Southern California collectors whose set was given to the J. Paul Getty Museum in 2011 and is now the centerpiece of \u201cIn Focus: Ansel Adams,\u201d which opens Tuesday.\n\nAugmented by several other Adams\u2019 photos from the museum\u2019s collection, the exhibition marks the 30th anniversary of the photographer\u2019s death next month. More than that, it provides a fresh look at both Adams\u2019 genius with a camera and in the darkroom.\n\n\u201cWhat sets them off, really,\u201d said Karen Hellman, who curated the exhibit, \u201cis that they were created all within a span of years by Ansel Adams himself, at a time when he was printing with a particular intensity in mind.\u201d\n\nThese were the photos the pioneer of art photography considered his best, Hellman continued, and he would take special pains in reproducing them to make sure people knew that.\n\n\u201cHe spoke about that at the time, how later in life he wanted to create images that were more impactful,\u201d said Hellman, assistant curator in the museum\u2019s Department of Photographs.\n\nAlthough the collection contains several instantly recognizable images, such as \u201cMoon and Half Dome,\u201d photographed in California\u2019s Yosemite National Park in 1960, and \u201cThe Tetons and the Snake River\u201d captured in Wyoming in 1942, it\u2019s safe to say even serious students of his work haven\u2019t seen photos quite like these.\n\nThe difference is likely best displayed in two large prints of arguably Adams\u2019 most famous work, \u201cMoonrise, Hernandez, New Mexico.\u201d The museum set photo printed by Adams in 1980 hangs side-by-side with one he printed in 1948.\n\nIn a brief video clip accompanying the exhibition, Adams describes how he captured the image on a late November afternoon in 1941. He was returning to Santa Fe from a day of fruitlessly searching for subjects to photograph, when he caught a glimpse out of his car window of an \u201cextraordinary\u201d scene of the moon rising over a cemetery.\n\n\u201cI practically ditched the car, and I had some companions with me,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI started yelling, you know, \u2018Get me the eight-by-ten, get me the tripod.'\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u2018Best of best\u2019 of Ansel Adams\u2019 photos on display", "title": "\u2018Best of best\u2019 of Ansel Adams\u2019 photos on display", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "\u2018Best of best\u2019 of Ansel Adams\u2019 photos on display", "title": "\u2018Best of best\u2019 of Ansel Adams\u2019 photos on display", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/03/17/best_of_best_of_ansel_adams_photos_on_display/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/ansel-adams-retrospective.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\u2018Best of best\u2019 of Ansel Adams\u2019 photos on display", "title": "\u2018Best of best\u2019 of Ansel Adams\u2019 photos on display", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/ansel-adams-retrospective.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "John Rogers", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Augmented by several other Adams\u2019 photos from the museum\u2019s collection, the exhibition marks the 30th anniversary of the photographer\u2019s death next month.\nThe difference is likely best displayed in two large prints of arguably Adams\u2019 most famous work, \u201cMoonrise, Hernandez, New Mexico.\u201d The museum set photo printed by Adams in 1980 hangs side-by-side with one he printed in 1948.\nTopics: From the Wires, Entertainment News, NewsLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 During the last years of his life, Ansel Adams pored over the tens of thousands of negatives he\u2019d carefully stored since his teens, setting aside 70 he determined would stand as his greatest works of art.\nMore than that, it provides a fresh look at both Adams\u2019 genius with a camera and in the darkroom.\nIn a brief video clip accompanying the exhibition, Adams describes how he captured the image on a late November afternoon in 1941."}
