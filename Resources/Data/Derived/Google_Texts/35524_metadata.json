Ted Cruz joined Jay Leno for a \u201cTonight Show\u201d segment Friday that was light on laughs but heavy in political debate.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been reading a lot about you lately, and they describe you as aggressive, arrogant and abrasive,\u201d Leno opened with. \u201cAccurate?\u201d\n\nCruz responded, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know that you can believe everything you read.\u201d\n\nSee video: ABC News Asks Ted Cruz: \u2018How Much Do Your Colleagues Just Despise You?\u2019\n\n\u201cAny one of those?\u201d Leno countered.\n\n\u201cYou know, what I\u2019m trying to do is do my job,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cAnd occasionally people don\u2019t like that.\u201d\n\nNaturally, the conversation turned to where Cruz has been making his mark \u2014 his staunch opposition to Obamacare. Cruz said that the plan is bad for his home state of Texas, because the Affordable Care Act kills jobs and will actually take away health insurance from some of those who already have it.\n\nSee video: Obama Apologizes for Botched Healthcare Rollout, Dropped Plans: \u2018We Didn\u2019t Do a Good Enough Job\u2019\n\nBefore long, the topic at hand was the other hot button issue that Cruz has been outspoken on: gay marriage. Leno said, \u201cTo me, Republic should be about defense and money; everything else is do whatever the hell you want, pretty much. Why all the focus \u2014 for example, gay marriage; you\u2019re against it?\n\nTo which Cruz replied, \u201cI support marriage between one man and one woman, but I also think it\u2019s a question for the states. Some states have made decisions one way on gay marriage; some states have made decisions the other way. And that\u2019s the great thing about our Constitution, is different states can make decisions depending on the values of their citizens.\u201d\n\nCruz was also asked about his father, a pastor who recently made headlines for his own opposition to same-sex marriage. The senator called his dad \u201ca man of deep integrity,\u201d saying his critics should attack him, not his father.\n\nWatch the clips:", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Ted-Cruz-Tonight-Show-150x150.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Tony Maglio", "description": "The Texas politician also discussed his opposition to gay marriage", "generator": "WooFramework 6.2.0", "og": {"site_name": "TheWrap", "description": "The Texas politician also discussed his opposition to gay marriage", "title": "Sen.
