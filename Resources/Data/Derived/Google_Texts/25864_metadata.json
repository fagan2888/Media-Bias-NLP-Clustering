Negotiations also rolled back a tax on health insurers for one year.\n\nAdded up, the delays will save taxpayers an estimated $36 billion. But their real significance is symbolic: They mark the biggest changes yet to the economics of Mr. Obama\u2019s health law, which had counted on those taxes to pay for all of the new benefits.\n\nStill, the White House considered itself lucky, saying that given Republicans\u2019 efforts to nix the law entirely, postponing a few tax hikes was a victory for Mr. Obama.\n\n\u201cWhen you consider their ambitions, the steps that are included in this proposal are quite, quite meager,\u201d White House press secretary Josh Earnest said.\n\nThe taxes were part of the 2010 law, and were designed to bring in money to help cover the costs of generous new benefits such as expanding Medicaid and offering taxpayer-funded subsidies to help many Americans buy insurance and meet the law\u2019s individual mandate.\n\nPostponing the taxes upsets the math and threatens Mr. Obama\u2019s vow that his law would be fully paid for and wouldn\u2019t add to the deficit.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s bad enough that this budget-busting tax deal would add to the debt, but lawmakers have decided to make things worse by undermining the cost-control measures in the Affordable Care Act,\u201d said Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.\n\nRepublicans on Capitol Hill, however, said they saw a chance to dent Obamacare \u2014 and took it.\n\nSen. Orrin G. Hatch, a Utah Republican who, as chairman of the Senate Committee on Finance, helped strike the deal to postpone the medical device tax, said they\u2019ll be back to finish it off.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s only for two years, but we\u2019re going to ultimately get rid of it completely,\u201d he said.\n\nThe 2.3 percent medical device excise applies to gross sales of pacemakers, artificial joints and other products. It\u2019s been unpopular with Democrats and Republicans whose districts and states are home to manufacturers who are now paying the tax, and who say it\u2019s sapping their ability to expand.\n\nMeanwhile, the Cadillac tax proved unpopular with labor unions, many of whom negotiated gold-plated insurance in lieu of pay raises in their contracts, and who felt betrayed by the tax.\n\nUntil now, their efforts ran into a wall of opposition from Mr. Obama. He defended the device tax as acceptable because he said his health law was boosting demand for devices, so companies would come out ahead anyway.\n\nThe White House and its economists were even more devoted to the Cadillac tax \u2014 a 40 percent excise on the cost of health coverage above $10,200 for an individual and $27,500 for family coverage \u2014 saying the high-value plans end up creating an incentive to overtreat patients, driving up health costs for everyone.\n\nLarry Levitt, senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan health policy organization, said a two-year postponement won\u2019t change the fundamental economics \u2014 but he said it\u2019s a precedent.\n\n\u201cThe big effects of the Cadillac tax come over the long-term because the thresholds under the tax grow with inflation, while health insurance premiums have historically grown much faster than that,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the same time, once Congress starts delaying a tax like this, it increases the chances that they\u2019ll keep delaying it rather than let it go into effect.\u201d\n\nRachel Cohen, a spokeswoman for Sen. Mark R. Warner, Virginia Democrat, warned that if Congress approves a delay now, \u201cthere will be more pressure two years from now to further postpone or repeal the Cadillac tax, which is essential to funding the health care law and keeping health care costs contained over the long term.\u201d\n\nBefore this latest deal, Congress had made only minor tweaks to the 2010 law, including clawing back more money when the government overpaid subsidies and repealing a tax-expensing provision that was designed to raise revenue by forcing small businesses to keep better track of their expenses. That was among the first things to go when the GOP took control of the House in 2011.\n\nCongressional Republicans have held repeated votes to repeal bigger parts of the health law, but each of those has come up short as Democrats filibustered in the Senate.\n\nThe latest effort, using a fast-track budget procedure to avoid the filibuster, cleared the Senate earlier this month, and only awaits final House action. But Mr. Obama has vowed to veto that, and there aren\u2019t the votes to overcome his rejection.\n\nThat leaves the GOP eyeing 2017, when they hope a Republican president can join with majorities in the House and Senate to undo more of the law.\n\n\u201cI expect that Congress will continue to try to cut taxes for powerful constituencies, including taxes imposed by the [Affordable Care Act],\u201d said Timothy Jost, a law professor at Washington and Lee University who closely tracks the law. \u201cFortunately, ACA spending has so far come in well below predictions. But, depending on who is elected president and who controls Congress as of 2017, there may be efforts to cut spending under the ACA as well.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Congress is poised to take the first major bites out of Obamacare's finances this week when it postpones a series of taxes intended to pay for the hefty overhaul &mdash; defying President Obama's pleas to leave his signature domestic achievement alone.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Congress is poised to take the first major bites out of Obamacare\u2019s finances this week when it postpones a series of taxes intended to pay for the hefty overhaul \u2014 defying President Obama\u2019s pleas to leave his signature domestic achievement alone.", "title": "Congress upsets Obamacare math, delays taxes needed to cover costs of generous new benefits", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/dec/16/congress-upsets-obamacare-math-delays-taxes-needed/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/12/16/OrrinHatch.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/12/16/OrrinHatch.jpg", "description": "Congress is poised to take the first major bites out of Obamacare's finances this week when it postpones a series of taxes intended to pay for the hefty overhaul &mdash; defying President Obama's plea", "card": "summary", "title": "Congress upsets Obamacare math, delays taxes needed to cover costs of"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Social Issues, Politics, Congress"}, "article_summary": "Congressional Republicans have held repeated votes to repeal bigger parts of the health law, but each of those has come up short as Democrats filibustered in the Senate.\nMeanwhile, the Cadillac tax proved unpopular with labor unions, many of whom negotiated gold-plated insurance in lieu of pay raises in their contracts, and who felt betrayed by the tax.\nPostponing the taxes upsets the math and threatens Mr. Obama\u2019s vow that his law would be fully paid for and wouldn\u2019t add to the deficit.\nHe defended the device tax as acceptable because he said his health law was boosting demand for devices, so companies would come out ahead anyway.\nBut their real significance is symbolic: They mark the biggest changes yet to the economics of Mr. Obama\u2019s health law, which had counted on those taxes to pay for all of the new benefits."}
