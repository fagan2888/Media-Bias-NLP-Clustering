U.S. Medical Management sells majority interest to St. Louis-based Centene

U.S. Medical Management, a Troy-based home care company, sold a majority interest in the company today to St. Louis-based Centene Corp. for about $200 million, officials said.



Under the deal, Centene (NYSE:CNC) will acquire a 68 percent interest in U.S. Medical Management, which was founded by CEO Mark Mitchell in 1993. Expected to close in early 2014, the purchase is expected to be funded with one-third cash and two-thirds Centene stock.



“We share Centene’s core belief that integrated care models lead to improved quality, enhanced medical outcomes and cost-efficient care,” Mitchell said in a statement. “We are confident that we will drive meaningful results and enhance care delivery for Centene’s growing high-acuity population.”
