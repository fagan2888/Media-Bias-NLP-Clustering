Mr. Santorum was even harsher when discussing Mr. Paul of Kentucky and Mr. Cruz of Texas, both first-term senators, dismissing them as \u201cbomb throwers\u201d with scant achievements.\n\nThe early salvos from Mr. Santorum, a former Pennsylvania senator, highlight the fierce competition already underway to win support from conservative activists.\n\nThe criticisms also illustrate the two simultaneous campaigns already taking shape. While former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey and perhaps Mr. Romney begin vying for commitments from center-right contributors, elected officials and activists, a parallel race is taking place among more conservative contenders including Mr. Santorum, Mr. Huckabee and the two senators.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAlready, there is notably less restraint in the language used by the more conservative aspirants than in the public statements from the establishment-backed potential candidates.\n\n\u201cDo we really want someone with this little experience?\u201d Mr. Santorum asked, referring to Mr. Paul, Mr. Cruz and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who is also in his first term. \u201cAnd the only experience they have basically \u2014 not Rubio, but Cruz and Paul because I don\u2019t think Rubio is going to go \u2014 is bomb throwing? Do we really want somebody who\u2019s a bomb thrower, with no track record of any accomplishments?\u201d\n\nMr. Paul\u2019s top strategist responded that the party should not take advice from a politician who was soundly defeated in 2006.\n\n\u201cSenator Santorum lost re-election in his home state by 18 points nearly a decade ago, and has spent the time since then trying to convince people to elect him to an even higher office than the one he was booted out of,\u201d said Doug Stafford, senior adviser to Mr. Paul. \u201cWe will pass on responding to his alleged wisdom.\u201d\n\nJason Miller, an adviser to Mr. Cruz, said the senator had \u201cdone exactly what he promised he\u2019d do,\u201d contending that Mr. Cruz had led \u201cthe fight to repeal Obamacare, protect the border and defend American sovereignty.\u201d\n\nMr. Huckabee, who has a following of Christian conservatives, may present the biggest obstacle to Mr. Santorum, who narrowly won the Iowa caucuses in 2012. But Mr. Santorum said Mr. Huckabee would have considerable vulnerabilities on the right.\n\n\u201cHe has to talk about Common Core. I love talking about Common Core,\u201d Mr. Santorum said of the education standards that have become deeply unpopular among conservatives. \u201cHe has to talk about immigration and the Dream Act. I love talking about immigration and the Dream Act. He has to talk about taxes; I haven\u2019t voted for a tax increase. I have a 100 percent record on taxes, signed every pledge every year.\u201d\n\nMr. Santorum then turned to an aide and asked: \u201cWhat\u2019s the other one?\u201d\n\nReminded that Mr. Huckabee had once backed a cap-and-trade program to reduce carbon emissions, Mr. Santorum exclaimed: \u201cClimate change. This guy was for climate change.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Huckabee\u2019s spokeswoman declined to address the individual issues, instead criticizing Mr. Santorum for \u201cpulling the pin on grenades tossed in our own G.O.P. tent.\u201d\n\n\u201cGovernor Huckabee\u2019s actual views \u2014 not the distortions of them \u2014 are fortunately well documented in his own voice through 12 published books, six and a half years of television and radio commentary, and daily postings on his blog and Facebook,\u201d said Alice Stewart, Mr. Huckabee\u2019s spokeswoman and a former spokeswoman for Mr. Santorum.\n\nMr. Santorum suggested that he was likely to declare his intention to run in the spring or early summer, and that the only reason he would not enter the race was if there were family-related concerns.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20150111212530, "twitter": {"description": "Rick Santorum sharply criticized potential rivals for the Republican presidential nomination, indicating he intends to reclaim conservative primary voters ahead of a new White House bid.", "creator": "jmartnyt", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/12/us/politics/rick-santorum-criticizes-rand-paul-and-ted-cruz-as-bomb-throwers.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003443605"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "title": "Santorum Criticizes Potential G.O.P.
