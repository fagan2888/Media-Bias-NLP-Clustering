The Ground Floor, Monday\u2019s office space for young companies in Rosslyn, is now open. The Metro-accessible space features a 5,000-square-foot common area that includes a kitchen, lounge area, collaborative meeting spaces, and a stage for formal presentations.\n\nTwo years ago, every major healthcare provider was facing a massive change in the way they would operate when the Affordable Care Act was signed into law, and almost none of them knew exactly what was changing.\n\nFrank Williams was the CEO of The Advisory Board Company \u2014 a healthcare consulting firm \u2014 when he and his colleagues realized the knowledge gap was not just a burgeoning problem in their industry, it was an emerging market.\n\n\u201cWe were going through a massive change of service that was massively complex, and no one knew how to do it,\u201d Williams said.\n\nWith a $25 million investment from The Advisory Board and the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Williams helped launch Evolent Health two years ago, with a mission to help guide medical providers through the changes in America\u2019s health care system.\n\nNow, Evolent occupies two floors of the new 800 N. Glebe Road building in Ballston, and has a satellite office in San Francisco. Evolent serves MedStar Health in this area, IU Health in Indianapolis and Premier Health in Ohio, among other companies.\n\nEven with a $25 million investment, Williams said the hardest part of launching Evolent was convincing healthcare systems that they needed Evolent\u2019s services.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about a significant vision of transforming the whole organization,\u201d Williams said. \u201cHow do you convince a MedStar to work with us?\u201d\n\nUltimately, Williams said, it was not how much money Evolent raised, but from where. The backing of The Advisory Board and UPMC gave it credibility in the eyes of potential clients.\n\n\u201cUPMC is a $10 billion health system,\u201d he said. \u201cThat gave us an immense street credibility.\u201d\n\nOnce Evolent signs on with a client, the work doesn\u2019t get any easier. The big shift for providers with Obamacare, Williams said, is providers have to provide healthcare for a population at large, not at a client-by-client basis. Instead of caring for patients only while they are within a hospital\u2019s walls, the new approach Evolent teaches is continual care, including calling patients to check in on their well-being.\n\nEvolent uses massive sets of data to \u201cengage patients with their health,\u201d Williams said. It also helps companies with risk and financial management and sets up businesses\u2019 infrastructure in the new system.\n\nThe new system has found resistance, but that comes with all change. Williams said once doctors, nurses and other healthcare workers see the difference \u2014 more time with patients, a focus on wellness as opposed to \u201cfilling a bed\u201d \u2014 they embrace it.\n\n\u201cEveryone needs to think very differently,\u201d Williams said. \u201cYou really have to invest time into it, but I think when people see they can spend a lot more time with their patients, they are excited. It\u2019s very exciting.\u201d\n\nEvolent was being conceived before the Affordable Care Act was even passed, and Williams said the months before it was signed into law were \u201cvery wobbly.\u201d Even with the debate in Congress before the recent government shutdown and much of the rhetoric during the 2012 presidential campaign, Williams never thought his company\u2019s future was in doubt.\n\n\u201cPeople had the view that they wouldn\u2019t have to change [if Obamacare hadn\u2019t passed],\u201d Williams said. \u201cNow, they would acknowledge that people are asking for value, and they would have anyway.\u201d\n\nToday, Evolent has close to 400 employees, many of whom work remotely with the clients in cities across the country. Last month, Evolent announced a $100 million investment from TPG Capital, a firm with more than $40 billion worth of global assets.\n\nNow, Williams is focused on being a leader in the market that is brand new, but a part of the largest industry in the country, healthcare. Even though clients signing up for Evolent have to make a big leap of faith, demand has been high, Williams said.\n\n\u201cMarket demand has been there more than we expected,\u201d Williams said. \u201cThis is a huge potential transformation in the industry and hopefully much better care for all of us. If we\u2019re successful, we\u2019re truly transforming an industry.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"city": "Arlington", "description": "Editor's Note:\u00a0Sponsored by\u00a0Monday Properties\u00a0and written by ARLnow.com,\u00a0Startup Monday\u00a0is a weekly column that profiles Arlington-based startups and their", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "ARLnow.com - Arlington, Va. - Breaking News, Opinions & Community Happenings", "description": "Editor's Note:\u00a0Sponsored by\u00a0Monday Properties\u00a0and written by ARLnow.com,\u00a0Startup Monday\u00a0is a weekly column that profiles Arlington-based startups and their founders.\u00a0The Ground Floor, Monday\u2019s office space for young companies in Rosslyn, is now open.
