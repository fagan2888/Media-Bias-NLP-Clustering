No federal tax credits for health coverage are available to people with workplace plans approved by the calculator.\n\nThe calculator is used by self-insured employers, which include most large firms.\n\nLike insurance companies, self-insured employers must certify that their plans pass the law\u2019s standards for consumer value.\n\nOne official way to do that is to get a passing score on the Health and Human Services Department\u2019s \u201cminimum-value\u201d calculator, an online tool.\n\nAn employer checks boxes on the screen indicating what benefits are offered \u2014 such as hospitalization, mental health care and pharmacy coverage \u2014 as well as workers\u2019 share of the cost. The calculator then determines whether the plan covers enough potential medical costs to be considered adequate insurance.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of errors in the calculator,\u201d said Shannon Demaree, director of actuarial services at Lockton Cos., a large broker. \u201cIt allows more plans to pass as qualifying coverage than we believe really do.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear which companies, or how many, are offering calculator-approved coverage without hospital benefits. Retailers, temp agencies and other lower-wage employers that have not traditionally offered comprehensive insurance are the most likely to sign up, brokers say.\n\n\u201cThere is very high interest\u201d among Lockton\u2019s clients, Demaree said.\n\nAbout 35 employers working with Assurance intend to offer such coverage, Smith said. The American Worker Plans, another Illinois firm, is advising about 30 companies considering that type of coverage, said Jon Duczak, the company\u2019s senior vice president.\n\nWhile they offer such plans because employers ask for them, Assurance and the American Worker Plans said they are cautioning them about their use. They did not identify the employers.\n\nHHS is aware of potential problems with the calculator but has not changed it, industry authorities said.\n\n\u201cI think they were somewhat naive in not realizing that people were going to game the heck out of it,\u201d said Hobson Carroll, an independent actuary who works closely with self-insured employers.\n\nHHS, which developed the calculator, referred queries about it to the Treasury Department, which it said is responsible for ensuring plans meet value standards. Treasury referred a reporter back to HHS.\n\nIntended to discourage coverage that leaves workers vulnerable to large medical costs, the calculator is an official yardstick for determining whether plans meet a \u201cminimum value\u201d of benefits, the most stringent health-law standard for employers.\n\nPassing the calculator test shields an employer from getting fined as much as $3,000 per worker next year, lawyers said.\n\nInstead of buying a commercial medical plan, employers that self-insure assume most of the risk of covering worker health costs. They generally outsource the design of the insurance and the administration of claims, however.\n\nThe average inpatient hospital bill is more than $10,000. But for workers, the plans\u2019 disadvantages go beyond the lack of hospital benefits.\n\nThe availability of company-sponsored, calculator-approved coverage at a certain price disqualifies them from getting tax credits that could help pay for better coverage through an online marketplace, said Sabrina Corlette, project director at Georgetown University\u2019s Center on Health Insurance Reforms.\n\n\u201cEmployers who offer these types of plans as the only option for their employees really need to search their consciences,\u201d she said.\n\nNext year, large employers face penalties for the first time for not providing qualified insurance. Benefits experts stressed that most will offer traditional coverage, including hospitalization.\n\nBut temporary staffing firms are especially interested in lower-value plans that may not include hospitalization, said Brian Robertson, executive vice president at Fringe Benefit Group, which recently bought the American Worker Plans.\n\nKey Benefit Administrators, which designs coverage and handles claims for what it said are more than a half-million members, offers a minimum-value plan to self-insured employers that lacks inpatient hospital benefits, according to documents on Assurance\u2019s Web site.\n\nKey\u2019s design \u201cmeets the . . . actuarial value requirement\u201d measured by the calculator and immunizes employers from paying all health-care law penalties for insufficient coverage, the promotional materials said.\n\nThe plan\u2019s total cost of about $200 per month per worker is about half the price of similar coverage with hospital benefits, experts said.\n\nConfidentiality agreements with customers prohibit Key from commenting on the plan, said Wallace Gray, the company\u2019s general counsel.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a million different attorneys check this out,\u201d Assurance\u2019s Smith said of Key\u2019s design. According to HHS\u2019s standards, \u201cit does meet all the criteria to be a compliant plan,\u201d she said.\n\nBut when Lockton tested such plans on a calculator used by the private sector, they flunked.\n\nTo meet the law\u2019s minimum value threshold, self-insured coverage must pay for at least 60 percent of expected medical costs in a typical plan. (Members pay the rest in deductibles, co-pays and other out-of-pocket expense.)\n\nIn Lockton\u2019s analysis, one plan with no hospital benefits being promoted as compliant with the law scored 63 percent on HHS\u2019s calculator \u2014 slightly above the minimum. But the industry calculator gave the same plan a value of only 47 percent \u2014 far below the 60 percent level needed to qualify as adequate, Demaree said.\n\n\u201cAll of [Lockton\u2019s] concerns are definitely concerns that we\u2019ve had,\u201d Smith said.\n\nSeveral consultants said they would not be surprised to see revisions in the minimum-value calculator \u2014 if not this year, then next.\n\nKaiser Health News is a national health policy news service.
