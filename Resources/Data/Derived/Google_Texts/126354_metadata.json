The buses were taken out of service after violating numerous mechanical and safety standards.\n\nThe violations included leaking fluids, missing brake pads, inoperative emergency exits, defective brake components and \"sharp or hazardous\" objects. Three drivers were also cited and fined for a pre-trip violation.\n\nAccording to Minnesota State Patrol, bus drivers are required to do an inspection prior to operating each day. No pre-trip inspection had been done since January. State Patrol does bus checks for school districts annually but also conducts audits and inspections at random. They say it is now the carrier's responsibility to rectify these violations before the buses can be used again.\n\nProctor School District Superintendent John Engelking provided this statement to Eyewitness News saying, \"...I am disappointed that we received numerous infractions in high patrol inspection, however, the infractions were not critical bus maintenance issues and we will have the repairs completed by next week.\"\n\nHe also says the school district will be bringing new rounds of training to their transportation department by early April. As of now, six of the violated buses have been fixed. The superintendent says he will use next week's spring break to fix all of the buses.\n\nState patrol says they will return in two weeks to make sure the buses were repaired properly.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "WDIO.com", "description": "The Proctor School District is having to make repairs to more than a dozen buses after they were red-flagged for violating safety standards required for daily operations.", "title": "Proctor School Buses Red-flagged for Safety Violations", "url": "http://www.wdio.com/news/proctor-school-buses-safety-violations/4085628/", "image": "http://www.wdio.com/2014/misc/WDIO-ABC--REFRESH.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 389635124505113}, "description": "The Proctor School District is having to make repairs to more than a dozen buses after they were red-flagged for violating safety standards required for daily operations.", "robots": "FOLLOW,INDEX", "thumbnail": "http://www.wdio.com/2014/misc/WDIO-ABC--REFRESH.jpg"}, "article_summary": "Taylor HoltUpdated: 03/25/2016 10:00 PMCreated: 03/25/2016 3:52 PMOn Wednesday, an inspection by Minnesota State Patrol found 16 of 20 Proctor School District buses unfit for safe transportation.\nHe also says the school district will be bringing new rounds of training to their transportation department by early April.\nAccording to Minnesota State Patrol, bus drivers are required to do an inspection prior to operating each day.\nState patrol says they will return in two weeks to make sure the buses were repaired properly.\nState Patrol does bus checks for school districts annually but also conducts audits and inspections at random."}
