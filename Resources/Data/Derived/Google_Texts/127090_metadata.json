The question becomes: how does the government deal more effectively with major projects like health care and do it effectively?\n\nFor those who remember the accomplishments of NASA in putting a man on the moon in the 1960\u2019s using computer technology that has less power than a modern cell phone, putting together a fast, effective website would seem like a minor task. But, based on the government\u2019s public failure in rolling out the new health care program, the effectiveness of government is being questioned.\n\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, one solution being considered is creating a new federal agency. The theory, apparently, is that having an agency specialize in bringing together federal technology specialists would enable the government to manage these projects more effectively. A cynic would question whether creating another federal agency is a good way to reduce the bureaucratic process that exists within government and whether such an agency would attract the talent necessary to work on major technology projects. While this approach may work, it also represents a common bureaucratic answer to fixing a problem: create more bureaucracy and spend more money to fix a problem caused, in part, by an organization that is already too bureaucratic.\n\nAnother idea being considered, according to the Journal, is expanding federal direct hiring authority. This would allow agencies to more effectively compete for information technology specialists.\n\nThe current federal hiring process usually requires evaluating multiple candidates for every position, lengthy questionnaires and giving preference to veterans. With any luck, an agency can make an offer to a prospective candidate in about 80 days or so. On the other hand, according to the Journal, talented technology workers are likely to receive multiple offers from private sector companies within two weeks. Presumably, the best qualified candidates are no longer available by the time an agency gets around to making an offer.\n\nThe Journal cites two reasons for the poor performance by the federal government: \u201crigid practices adopted by risk-averse officials and the government\u2019s inability to attract top-notch technology talent.\u201d\n\nOne problem in attracting the best technology specialists is a widely held perception that the government is more focused on \u201cpunishing failure rather than rewarding innovation.\u201d In a notable quote from the Journal describing the government process, \u201cThere are dozens of rules, and lots of people who can say no in that process, and very few risk absorbers: someone willing to stand up and say, \u2018Go forth and do well, I\u2019ll take the risk.\u201d\n\nPart of the problem may be that the federal government workforce is older than many similar professionals in the private sector. According to the Office of Personnel Management, there are eight times as many federal technology employees over age 50 as the number who are under age 30. This would suggest that the government may be using specialists that are more familiar with older technology and methods and may be a drawback in meeting the requirements of the newer technology that, presumably, works faster and better than older models and methods.\n\n\u00a9 2016 FedSmith Inc.
