Gipp has been appointed by the American Indian College Fund to serve as the Fund\u2019s representative on the Cobell Board of Trustees.\n\nGipp is the former president of United Tribes Technical College and currently serves as the college\u2019s chancellor, focusing on outreach, partnerships and development.\n\nDr. Gipp is very knowledgeable about education, tribal and federal relations, and is a skilled coalition builder,\u201d said Cheryl Crazy Bull, president and CEO of the Fund.\n\nCrazy Bull made the announcement of Gipp\u2019s appointment in July, saying that Gipp is \u201cvery familiar with the Cobell case and settlement.\u201d\n\nGipp is the founding executive director of the American Indian Higher Education Consortium. He is an emeritus trustee of the College Fund Board, and served on a committee that helped establish the Fund\u2019s involvement in making scholarships with a portion of the Cobell settlement.\n\nThe $3.4 billion settlement in 2010 was named for Blackfeet Tribal citizen Elouise Cobell. It resolved historic claims of government mismanagement of royalties on Indian lands. Approximately $60 million was earmarked for educational scholarships for American Indian students.\n\nThe College Fund, based in Denver, Colorado, is the principal administrator and will distribute 80 percent of the program\u2019s funds. The remainder will go through the American Indian Graduate Center of Albuquerque, New Mexico.\n\nThe five member Cobell Trustee board, to which Gipp has been appointed, must set the criteria for eligibility and distribution to potential scholarship recipients. The funds are to be awarded over a 10-year period.\n\n\u201cI believe I can contribute to the development of a program that will make these resources available to the largest numbers of potential recipients,\u201d said Gipp. \u201cI appreciate the opportunity to be involved on behalf of the College Fund. The Fund has great competency and accountability for administering a program like this to the TCU\u2019s and scholarship recipients.\u201d\n\nEstablished in 1989, the College Fund is the nation\u2019s largest and highest-rated American Indian scholarship organization. The organization provides Native student scholarships and programmatic support for the nation\u2019s 34 accredited tribal colleges and universities.", "article_metadata": {"description": "David M.
