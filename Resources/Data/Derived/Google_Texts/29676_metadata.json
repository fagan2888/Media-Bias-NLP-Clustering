Is it time to repeal the 17th?\n\nWhat? You have no idea what the 17th Amendment is? Well, it is the one that effectively ended federalism by taking the power to appoint U.S. senators from state legislatures and having the citizens directly elect them, as they had always done with the House of Representatives.\n\nWe may not get better senators, but it is likely they would not try dictate to the states what they should do \u2014 as they did when they set the national speed limit at 55 mph and the drinking age at 21, under threat of losing highway funding. No Child Left Behind dictates education standards under threat of losing funding. The Motor Voter Law told states how to register voters.\n\nObamaCare threatened federal funding if states did not expand Medicaid and set up exchanges, until the Supreme Court decided that was too onerous.\n\nJames Madison said during debate over the Bill of Rights, \u201cThe state legislatures will jealously and closely watch the operations of Government, and be able to resist with more effect every assumption of power, than any other power on earth can do; and the greatest opponents to a Federal government admit the State Legislatures to be sure guardians of people\u2019s liberty.\u201d\n\nThere was a grand design to balance power, but that was broken in 1913 with the passage of the 17th Amendment.\n\nGeorge Mason warned when the Constitution was being drafted in Philadelphia that the Senate had to represent the states lest the federal government \u201cswallow up the state legislatures.\u201d\n\nMason argued to the delegation, \u201c(W)e have agreed that the national Legislature shall have a negative on the State Legislatures \u2014 the Danger is that the national, will swallow up the State Legislatures \u2014 what will be a reasonable guard agt. this Danger, and operate in favor of the State authorities \u2014 The answer seems to me to be this, let the State Legislatures appoint the Senate \u2026\u201d\n\nThe delegates backed him unanimously.\n\nJustice Antonin Scalia in 2010 at Texas Tech University Law School was asked what he would change about the Constitution.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s very little that I would change,\u201d he said. \u201cI would change it back to what they wrote, in some respects. The 17th Amendment has changed things enormously.\u201d\n\nScalia added, \u201cWe changed that in a burst of progressivism in 1913, and you can trace the decline of so-called states\u2019 rights throughout the rest of the 20th century. So, don\u2019t mess with the Constitution.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s how we got FDR\u2019s New Deal.\n\nThen there is the argument put forward by Nevada\u2019s own Jay Bybee, former William Boyd Law School constitutional law professor at UNLV and now judge on the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on the recommendation of Nevada\u2019s senior senator, Harry Reid.\n\nIn 1997 Bybee penned an article for the Northwestern University Law Review titled \u201cUlysses at the Mast: Democracy, Federalism, and the Siren\u2019s Song.\u201d In Greek mythology, beautiful sirens lured sailors with their music and voices to shipwreck on the rocky coast of their island.\n\nBybee wrote of the passage of the 17th Amendment with a rhetorical flourish:\n\n\u201cMason wished to provide some mechanism for states to defend themselves against \u2018encroachment\u2019 by a national government that everyone recognized would have significantly more power than any American sovereign since July 3, 1776. A senate appointed by state legislatures would be a near-complete defense to national encroachment because the senate controlled one-half of Congress. \u2026 \u201cThe Senate\u2019s slide to popular democracy unyoked states and the national government in a way that has left the states nearly powerless to defend their position as other legitimate representatives of the people. As the United States moved into the Twentieth Century, it was inevitable that Congress would aggressively exercise power over matters such as commerce and spending for the general welfare in ways that no constitutional prophet would have foreseen. The lack of foresight of the circumstances under which Congress would exercise its powers did not excuse our failure to maintain those constitutional structures that assure the tempered, essential use of such powers. When we loosed ourselves from the mast to answer the Sirens\u2019 call, we unleashed consequences only Circe could have foreseen.\u201d\n\nIf the state Legislature of Nevada appointed the state\u2019s two senators, do you think Reid would be calling them cowards for not voting to outlaw brothels in rural counties as he demanded in a speech at the Legislature in 2011?\n\n(A version of this column appeared recently in The Ely Times, Eureka Sentinel, Mineral County Independent-News, Lincoln County Record, the Elko Daily Free Press and theMesquite Local News.
