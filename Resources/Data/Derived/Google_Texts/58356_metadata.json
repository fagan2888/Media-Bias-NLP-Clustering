It\u2019s important to elect people who care about us as much as themselves. So when I saw a negative ad on television the other day about Penny Bernard Schaber, I did a little digging to see if it was true. The ad wonders if \u201cshe\u2019d go back and vote differently on all the bad policies she supported under Jim Doyle.\u201d The ad infers that Penny voted to give herself a pay raise. It turns out this is absolutely a fabrication. What else would one expect from Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce than a manufactured lie?\n\nThe truth is, the state Legislature never votes on pay raises. The salaries of state elected officials are set by the Office of State Employment Relations. From that office, the recommendations are approved by a committee of legislators, the Joint Committee on Employment Relations. The JCER is made up of four Democrats and four Republicans and they voted unanimously to raise the salaries of over 7,000 state workers, including elected state officials and legislators in November 2007.\n\nThat means the pay raise was set 14 months before Penny Bernard Schaber even took office in the state Assembly in January 2009.\n\nOn the other hand, Penny\u2019s opponent for state Senate was in the Legislature in November 2007 and accepted the pay raise. However, the WMC turns a blind eye to the inaction of the candidate it\u2019s supporting.\n\nI\u2019ll continue to support Penny Bernard Schaber for state Senate because I know she cares about us and will honestly represent the people in the 19th Senate District.\n\nAnn Muenster,\n\nAppleton\n\nRead or Share this story: http://post.cr/1sehkCj", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Senate candidate wasn\u2019t in office when pay raise was approved", "og": {"site_name": "Post-Crescent Media", "description": "Senate candidate wasn\u2019t in office when pay raise was approved", "title": "Letters: Bernard Schaber criticism wrong", "url": "http://www.postcrescent.com/story/opinion/readers/2014/09/21/letters-bernard-schaber-criticism-wrong/15840867/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/postcrescent.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Senate candidate wasn\u2019t in office when pay raise was approved", "title": "Letters: Bernard Schaber criticism wrong", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c6423aaf847cecd3e5c7a4dccdbf677b325f1a0f/c=354-0-3177-2823&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Appleton/2014/09/18/voting33.jpg", "creator": "@postcrescent", "site": "@postcrescent", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=880652726", "fb": {"app_id": 117306038338949}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": ""}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcb02\"", "article_summary": "I\u2019ll continue to support Penny Bernard Schaber for state Senate because I know she cares about us and will honestly represent the people in the 19th Senate District.\nSo when I saw a negative ad on television the other day about Penny Bernard Schaber, I did a little digging to see if it was true.\nThat means the pay raise was set 14 months before Penny Bernard Schaber even took office in the state Assembly in January 2009.\nOn the other hand, Penny\u2019s opponent for state Senate was in the Legislature in November 2007 and accepted the pay raise.\nSenate candidate wasn\u2019t in office when pay raise was approvedGroup of People's Hands Holding Word Vote (Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto )What\u2019s a busy voter to do?"}
