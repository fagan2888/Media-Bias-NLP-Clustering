After all the controversy, Harvey now says he\u2019s finally able to laugh at it.\n\n\u201cWhen something major happens that\u2019s kind of negative in your life, you just have to ride the storm out, you never know how it\u2019s going to be, who ever thought that this mishap with Miss Universe would turn into a Super Bowl commercial,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added: \u201cIt was a tough thing that happened, but after a while you need to start smiling about this. \u2026 I like T-Mobile, so I thought it would be a great idea and I liked the concept. Take a nice little dig at myself.\u201d\n\nThe spot is a play on a previous Verizon commercial that explains its rivals\u2019 performance using colorful balls. The T-Mobile spot starts out with an announcer and looks similar to the Verizon ad, but then Harvey appears and apologizes to T-Mobile customers for what he says are claims about T-Mobile\u2019s coverage based on last year\u2019s numbers.\n\n\u201cIt says right here on the card, T-Mobile doubled their LTE coverage in the last year with more LTE towers than Verizon. T-Mobile reaches pretty much everyone they do. I\u2019m not taking responsibility on this one. Uh-uh. Verizon got it wrong. Yes! Not me,\u201d he said in the ad.\n\nHarvey had also showed the audience the cue card he misread at the pageant when he apologized for his mistake.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "WWAY TV3", "description": "Steve Harvey\u2019s Miss Universe blunder \u2013- when he mistakenly crowned the wrong woman winner of the pageant -\u2013 made him the target of jokes and criticism the world over, but the comedian and talk show host turned that moment into laughs with his surprise Super Bowl commercial for T-Mobile.", "title": "Harvey\u2019s T-Mobile ad pokes fun at pageant blunder - WWAY TV3", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1016, "identifier": "http://www.wwaytv3.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SteveHarveyTMobile-e1454898470447.jpg", "height": 764}, "updated_time": "2016-02-07T21:56:44-04:00", "url": "http://www.wwaytv3.com/2016/02/07/harveys-t-mobile-ad-pokes-fun-at-pageant-blunder/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wwaytv3", "section": "News", "tag": "Super Bowl 50", "published_time": "2016-02-07T21:07:27-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-07T21:56:44-04:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Steve Harvey\u2019s Miss Universe blunder \u2013- when he mistakenly crowned the wrong woman winner of the pageant -\u2013 made him the target of jokes and criticism the world over, but the comedian and talk show host turned that moment into laughs with his surprise Super Bowl commercial for T-Mobile.", "creator": "@wway", "image": "http://i0.wp.com/www.wwaytv3.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SteveHarveyTMobile-e1454898470447.jpg?resize=1016%2C764", "title": "Harvey\u2019s T-Mobile ad pokes fun at pageant blunder - WWAY TV3", "site": "@wway", "card": "summary"}, "generator": "Feed to Post 3.7.1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Comedian Steve Harvey pokes fun of his blunder at the Miss Universe pageant in a Super Bowl commercial for T-Mobile.\nHarvey had also showed the audience the cue card he misread at the pageant when he apologized for his mistake.\nTake a nice little dig at myself.\u201dThe spot is a play on a previous Verizon commercial that explains its rivals\u2019 performance using colorful balls.\nIn the spot, he apologizes to T-Mobile customers for making a mistake, and then blames rival cell carrier Verizon for the error.\nThe T-Mobile spot starts out with an announcer and looks similar to the Verizon ad, but then Harvey appears and apologizes to T-Mobile customers for what he says are claims about T-Mobile\u2019s coverage based on last year\u2019s numbers."}
