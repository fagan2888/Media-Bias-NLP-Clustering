Ahmedani, Ph.D., lead author of the new study. Dr. Ahmedani is a researcher at the Center for Health Policy and Health Services Research.\n\n\"The policy was adopted as a way to curb rising healthcare costs and improve quality of care, and CMS chose those three conditions because they're common, expensive to treat, and often result in readmission.\"\n\nHospital readmissions account for a large share of healthcare spending in the U.S., including more than $17 billion of Medicare costs each year. In attempting to reduce excessive readmissions - those occurring within 30 days of a patient's original hospitalization - CMS is expected to add other medical conditions to the three already used as standards.\n\nThe video will load shortly Henry Ford Health System researcher Brian K.

It was the largest and most geographically diverse investigation of its kind.\n\nAnalysis of the data found that patients with psychiatric comorbidities in the previous year were readmitted to the hospital 3 to 5 percent more often within 30 days than those without a psychiatric diagnosis.\n\nPerhaps even more troubling, the researchers noted, is that nearly 30 percent of those admitted to the hospital with heart failure, AMI or pneumonia were diagnosed in the previous year as having a mental health condition.\n\nMost important, the study concluded, individuals with a psychiatric concern probably accounted for an even larger proportion of admissions for heart failure, AMI or pneumonia, but because mental health conditions are often not diagnosed, these illnesses weren't captured in medical records.\n\n\"These findings suggest that psychiatric comorbidities influence 30-day all-cause readmission rates for individuals with heart failure, AMI and pneumonia,\" Ahmedani says.\n\n\"Because depression, anxiety and substance abuse appeared to be the most common diagnoses among the patients we studied, and because each was associated with increased readmission rates, these disorders may be the most appropriate for healthcare systems to focus their primary screening efforts.\"\n\nUsing this knowledge to target patients at higher risk of readmission, the study concluded, it may be possible to make progress toward the long-term goal of improving the quality and cost of healthcare and easing the risk to hospitals of CMS penalties for excessive readmissions.\n\nExplore further: Hospitals serving elderly poor more likely to be penalized for readmissions", "article_metadata": {"Description": "Co-existing psychiatric illness should be considered in assessing hospital readmissions for three common medical conditions used by Medicare and Medicaid to penalize hospitals with \"excessive\" readmission rates.", "og": {"url": "http://medicalxpress.com/news/2015-03-mental-health-disorders-complicate-standards.html", "image": "http://cdn.medicalxpress.com/tmpl/v5/img/medx308px.png", "type": "article", "description": "Co-existing psychiatric illness should be considered in assessing hospital readmissions for three common medical conditions used by Medicare and Medicaid to penalize hospitals with \"excessive\" readmission rates.", "title": "Mental health disorders complicate standards used by ACA to penalize hospitals for readmission"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://medicalxpress.com/news/2015-03-mental-health-disorders-complicate-standards.html", "account_id": 287568380, "description": "Co-existing psychiatric illness should be considered in assessing hospital readmissions for three common medical conditions used by Medicare and Medicaid to penalize hospitals with \"excessive\" readmission ...", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Mental health disorders complicate standards used by ACA to penalize hospitals for readmission"}, "ROBOTS": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 325486637469240}, "Keywords": "Medicine Research News, Medicine Research, Health Research News, Health Research, Health Science, Medicine Science", "viewport": "width=1024"}, "article_summary": "Co-existing psychiatric illness should be considered in assessing hospital readmissions for three common medical conditions used by Medicare and Medicaid to penalize hospitals with \"excessive\" readmission rates.\n\"These findings suggest that psychiatric comorbidities influence 30-day all-cause readmission rates for individuals with heart failure, AMI and pneumonia,\" Ahmedani says.\nDr. Ahmedani is a researcher at the Center for Health Policy and Health Services Research.\n\"Our current study chose to focus on psychiatric conditions.\"\nIn attempting to reduce excessive readmissions - those occurring within 30 days of a patient's original hospitalization - CMS is expected to add other medical conditions to the three already used as standards."}
