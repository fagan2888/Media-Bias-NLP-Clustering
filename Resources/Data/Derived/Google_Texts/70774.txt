Since the Wigwam Teahouse was built, there have been a number of additions to the structure to expand the living space, but the original logs can still be seen on its south end. ( Kenneth Jessen / For the Reporter-Herald )

An example of an early roadside tourist business is located along Aspen Brook.

In 1905, the Reichardt Stage Road was constructed as a direct route to from Estes Park to Lily Lake.

In 1907, Ann Wolfram homesteaded the land were the teahouse is located and received title in 1915, the year Rocky Mountain National Park was established. Her small homestead cabin still stands on the property.

Wolfram constructed the teahouse in about 1913 for passing travelers and sold Indian handicrafts as well as refreshments. The original building was made of logs, but there have been several additions to convert the structure into a home.

Wolfram added a proper home on the property in 1938 and a bunkhouse in 1940.

She also owned a curio shop in Estes Park and is recognized as one of the area's pioneer female entrepreneurs.

After Wolfram left the business, the teahouse and its associated buildings changed hands several times until it was purchased by the National Park Service in 1985.

To reach the Wigwam Teahouse requires a hike of over two miles from Lily Lake using the Storm Pass Trail dropping down 700 feet to Aspen Brook.

The first part of the trail is through a dense forest. It then opens out into a meadow where there are the ruins of the Jimmy Field cabin. The teahouse is located below in a second meadow near the park boundary. (Access from below is restricted by private property.)
