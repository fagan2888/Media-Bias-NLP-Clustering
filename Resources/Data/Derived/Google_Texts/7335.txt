HARRISBURG, Pa. (WHTM) – Federal regulators will oppose a plan to bring together Penn State Hershey Medical Center and the Harrisburg-based PinnacleHealth System.

The Federal Trade Commission has notified the health systems that it may file a lawsuit to prevent their integration, according to a joint news release from Penn State Hershey and PinnacleHealth.

In a statement, the health systems said they are extremely disappointed because they believe the integration of Penn State Hershey and PinnacleHealth would serve the best interests of patients in central Pennsylvania.

“The joining of our two health systems is completely consistent with the goals of the Affordable Care Act. It creates the depth of services and scale that is required to manage the health of distinct populations of patients and better positions us to provide the most appropriate care, in the most appropriate setting at the lowest possible cost,” the statement reads.

Penn State Hershey’s campus includes Penn State College of Medicine, Penn State Hershey Cancer Institute, and Penn State Hershey Children’s Hospital.

PinnacleHealth includes Community, West Shore, Harrisburg and Polyclinic hospitals, PinnacleHealth Medical Group, PinnacleHealth Cancer Institute, the Pennsylvania Psychiatric Institute and the Helen M. Simpson Rehab Hospital.
