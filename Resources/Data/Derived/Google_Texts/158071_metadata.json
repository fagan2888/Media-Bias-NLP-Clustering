But consumers who don\u2019t buy through the exchange are not eligible for premium subsidies.\n\nThe ACA subsidizes premiums for consumers who purchase their plans through exchanges, based on income.\n\nExisting policies will remain in force until the end of the year. And the insurer\u2019s small group, large group, commercial, Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug, Medicaid and individual dental plans will not be affected.\n\nInsurance Superintendent John Franchini earlier this month rejected Blue Cross Blue Shield\u2019s request for a rate increase averaging 51.6 percent. Franchini said he was prepared to instead approve a 24 percent increase and was waiting for Blue Cross Blue Shield\u2019s response.\n\nHe had approved much smaller rate increases for the other insurance companies that offer plans on the exchange \u2013 Presbyterian Health Plan, Molina Healthcare of New Mexico, Christus Health Plan and New Mexico Health Connections.\n\nThose insurers say they are willing to accommodate Blue Cross members who decide to pick their plans. The open enrollment period to purchase plans on the exchange will begin Nov. 1.\n\n\u201cWe are extremely disappointed that BCBSNM will not be an option for our customers on the New Mexico Health Insurance Exchange in 2016,\u201d Shipley said.\n\nFranchini said Blue Cross could return to the exchange after one year and offer plans for 2017.\n\nBlue Cross actually lost more than the $19.2 million the company cited in the letter Wednesday but received more than $23 million from a pool set up by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to help insurers offset unusually high claims. The pool is financed with mandatory contributions from insurers.", "article_metadata": {"description": "ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. \u2014 Thousands of New Mexicans will be affected", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Rosalie Rayburn | Journal Staff Writer", "og": {"url": "http://www.abqjournal.com/634713/blue-cross-blue-shield-of-new-mexico-pulls-out-of-the-health-exchange.html", "image": "http://www.abqjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/mb09_jd_22sep_4pitch-1000x608.jpg", "type": "website", "description": "Thousands of New Mexicans will be affected", "title": "Updated: Blue Cross of NM pulls out of exchange"}, "fb": {"pages": 76430478236, "app_id": 419447351433280}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Franchini said he was prepared to instead approve a 24 percent increase and was waiting for Blue Cross Blue Shield\u2019s response.\nInsurance Superintendent John Franchini earlier this month rejected Blue Cross Blue Shield\u2019s request for a rate increase averaging 51.6 percent.\n.......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... ..........ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. \u2014 Thousands of New Mexicans will need to shop for new health insurance plans later this year after a decision by Blue Cross Blue Shield to stop offering individual insurance plans through the state health exchange beginning Jan. 1.\nThe letter said Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Mexico lost $19.2 million in 2015 on the 35,000 individuals covered by plans they purchased on and off the exchange.\nFranchini said Blue Cross could return to the exchange after one year and offer plans for 2017."}
