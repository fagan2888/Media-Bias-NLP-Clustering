Advocates fear that as beaches are hit by coastal erosion, rising sea levels and the threat of powerful storms, private property rights could take precedent over access to public beach access.\n\n\u201cWe have two rock-solid principles: public access to public beaches, and the right of private owners to exclude others from the property which is theirs,\u201d said David Abraham, a law professor at the University of Miami. \u201cThey\u2019re always in tension, but if we face issues like sea-level rise and increasingly severe storms, there\u2019s going to be less stability in that balance.\u201d\n\nFor decades, the Open Beaches Act \u2014 which passed in 1959 \u2014 was a signal to property owners on the shore that if erosion or a storm wiped out the public beach behind them, their homes could become state property. In the last several years, the General Land Office, the state agency that deals with coastal issues, has taken 18 properties for that reason, reimbursing owners $50,000 each.\n\nAfter Hurricane Rita hit in 2005, Carol Severance sued the state when it said her Galveston property was in the public domain. In 2010, the Texas Supreme Court ruled in her favor, saying the property remained private because the beach had been wiped out through an \u201cavulsive\u201d event, like a big storm \u2014 rather than \u201cimperceptible\u201d coastal erosion.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nPublic beach advocates say the decision went too far. Rob Nixon, chairman of the Surfrider Foundation\u2019s South Texas chapter, said it \u201csets up unrestricted development of the coast, which is going to ultimately put the Texas taxpayer and public on the dime for bailing all these people out.\u201d\n\nBut many advocates for private property rights hailed the ruling. Among the supporters is George P. Bush, a Republican widely expected to win the November election to head the General Land Office.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe that the state should take land\u201d in the event of storms, Mr. Bush said recently during an event hosted by The Texas Tribune. He added that landowners whose property had been taken were not compensated enough, and that there were many other places along the coast that the public can access without threatening private property interests.\n\nThe current land commissioner, Jerry Patterson, who was named in the Severance lawsuit, said the ruling weakened public access in a \u201cCalifornication of Texas beaches.\u201d As a result of the decision, the General Land Office canceled a $40 million beach nourishment project in Galveston for fear of illegally spending public money on private land.\n\nMr. Patterson said he feared more similar projects would have to be abandoned.\n\n\u201cWhat we have now is these private property owners who think they have won,\u201d Mr. Patterson said. \u201cIf they expected a beach renourishment, it ain\u2019t happening. They\u2019ve lost.\u201d\n\nAttorney General Greg Abbott, the Republican candidate for governor and a former Texas Supreme Court justice, also criticized the Severance decision in a 2010 request for justices to rehear the case, writing that \u201cwith the stroke of a pen, a divided court has effectively eliminated the public\u2019s rights on the dry beach.\u201d\n\nAfter rehearing the case, the court issued the same ruling two years later. Mr. Abbott\u2019s campaign did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nWhether the court decision will extend from Galveston to the entire Texas coast is not clear. Mr. Bush has said that he believes it should, but that would probably have to be resolved by another court case.\n\nIt remains unclear how to distinguish between storm events and coastal erosion. Storms can contribute to accelerated erosion, but the Severance decision said that only in the case of storms can private property remain private after the public beach has been destroyed.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cYou have a storm, and then you have erosion after the storm for a couple of years,\u201d said Joseph Kalo, a professor at the University of North Carolina School of Law, imagining a common scenario. \u201cAnd the question is, how do things kind of work out then?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime":
