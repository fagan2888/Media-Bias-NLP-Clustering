Even on a windy day, plenty of people are ready to hit the greens

Yet, at L.W. Clapp Golf Course, but when people head out to Clapp Golf Course, they're bound to notice something different: footgolf.

"It's something unique and new," said Michael Solomon, head golf professional. "It's definitely caught on on the coasts, both east and west, mostly in California."

Footgolf is a cross between soccer and golf, where people use their legs as golf clubs; a soccer ball is the new "golf ball." Two other golf courses expanded to the new game this year, including Pine Bay in Haysville and Andover Municipal Golf Course.

Clapp, located at Harry and Oliver, opened up this week. Staff added the new footgolf holes in October. The holes span nearly two feet wide for the larger footgolf balls. Solomon said the game can be difficult, especially with the holes in different spots.

"They're behind trees and in the rough," he said. "There are a bunch of different areas that offer a bit of a challenge for us."

Now, Solomon hopes families and young people will embrace the new sport like people have around the world.

"I can't wait until it warms up," he said. "People are ready to play."
