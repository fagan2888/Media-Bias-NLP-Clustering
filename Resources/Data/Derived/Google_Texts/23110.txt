MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Wind power may be about to pick up in Wisconsin.

No major wind farms have been built in the state in the past five years. But that may be about to change.

The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reports nearly 50 wind turbines could be built in southwestern Wisconsin over the next year. A global renewable energy company based in Spain hopes to build the Lafayette County wind farm in 2017. The project is valued at about $200 million.

And state regulators are taking another look at a proposed $250 million wind farm in western Wisconsin.

Emerging Energies of Wisconsin wants to build 44 large wind turbines in St. Croix County. Residents have opposed the project, but the state Public Service commission decided Friday to reopen the case.
