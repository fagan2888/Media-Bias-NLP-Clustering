The average family premium is $16,834, and the average employee pays $4,823 of that. \u201cPremiums increased more slowly over the past five years than the preceding five years (26 percent vs. 34 percent) and well below the annual double-digit increases recorded in the late 1990s and early 2000s,\u201d the Kaiser Family Foundation, which conducted the survey, said in a statement.

A second survey by Avalere Health looks at the health insurance exchanges, where about 10 million people are buying health insurance this year.

Nine of the companies that got the most new customers have asked state insurance commissions for rate increases of 9 percent or more for 2015. That might be because it was difficult to predict how much it would cost to cover the new customers, said Caroline Pearson, vice president at Avalere. \u201cConsumers should look at their plan premiums carefully and consider whether they should shop for a lower premium option in 2015 rather than re-enroll, especially if they qualify for federal premium subsidies,\u201d she advises.\n\nIN-DEPTH\n\n\u2014 Maggie Fox", "article_metadata": {"description": "Insurance companies raised their rates for premiums by about 3 percent this year for people covered by employer insurance, according to a new report.", "og": {"url": "http://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/average-health-insurance-premiums-rise-slightly-n200121", "type": "article", "image": "http://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2014_25/515806/140618-obamacare-mn-840_418230a27301322e51b5678c1c6f681e.nbcnews-fp-1200-800.jpg", "site_name": "NBC News", "description": "Insurance companies raised their rates for premiums by about 3 percent this year for people covered by employer insurance, according to a new report."}, "twitter": {"domain": "NBCNews.com", "description": "Insurance companies raised their rates for premiums by about 3 percent this year for people covered by employer insurance, according to a new report.", "creator": "NBCNews", "image": {"src": "http://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2014_25/515806/140618-obamacare-mn-840_418230a27301322e51b5678c1c6f681e.nbcnews-fp-1200-800.jpg"}, "title": "Average Health Insurance Premiums Rise Slightly - NBC News", "site": "NBCNews", "card": "summary"}, "blitz": "mu-e1e842c9-946002e6-ea8f0454-41b29546", "DC.date.issued": "2014-09-10", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=319740707, app-argument=http://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/average-health-insurance-premiums-rise-slightly-n200121", "fb": {"app_id": 10150138890205613}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Maggie-Fox/262695730411456"}, "google-site-verification": "K8bowvEbzWfPQ76x6f9SCxMVwicVXrhiClRg80ak8ZA", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Health,Health news,Business News"}, "article_summary": "A second survey by Avalere Health looks at the health insurance exchanges, where about 10 million people are buying health insurance this year.\nThe average family premium is $16,834, and the average employee pays $4,823 of that.\nInsurance companies raised their rates for premiums by about 3 percent this year for people covered by employer health insurance, which includes most Americans, according to a new report.\nPlay FacebookTwitterGoogle PlusEmbed Obamacare Signups Approach First-Year Goal 1:06 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blogIt\u2019s a good baseline to use for measuring how much Obamacare may affect health insurance premiums.\nNine of the companies that got the most new customers have asked state insurance commissions for rate increases of 9 percent or more for 2015."}
