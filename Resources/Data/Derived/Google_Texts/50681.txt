Good morning. We’ve made it to Friday, and the pledge drive is over. It doesn’t get much better than that. Let’s take a look at the Digest.

1. Once again the Legislature has rejected a push to allow Minnesota liquor stores to open on Sundays. Supporters of the idea tried to attach it to a liquor bill in the House Thursday, but it failed by a 14-vote margin. Sunday sales are popular with the public, but smaller liquor stores and the Teamsters Union want to have one day a week off. So if the thirst hits on Sunday the best idea remains to stock up in advance or go to an on-sale establishment. (MPR News)

2. Another issue that appears dead for the session is the push to define daily fantasy sports games as games of skill rather than gambling. Facing opposition, the Senate author of the bill pulled it from consideration and said she’ll try again next year. (MPR News)

3. The president of the Minneapolis Park Board will not apologize to the president of the Minneapolis NAACP after a shouting match at a meeting on Wednesday. Liz Wielinski of the park board says Nekima Levy-Pounds of the NAACP interrupted a meeting. Levy-Pounds was trying to raise concerns about racial inequities and says she was treated like a child.

4. Donald Trump and Paul Ryan talked nice after their brief meeting yesterday, even though Ryan still stopped short of an endorsement. Many Republicans appear to be falling in line behind Trump, but there are still some holdouts who are talking about forming a third party. (ABC News)

5. A federal judge sided with House Republicans and said the Obama Administration should not be able to reimburse insurance companies that participate in the Affordable Care Act because Congress has not properly authorized the payments. The administration plans to appeal, and the judge said the program can continue pending the appeal. This whole thing seems headed to the Supreme Court. (CNN)
