Spotlight on … Nikola Vucevic, center, Magic

When: It’s not often these days that a player from the Orlando Magic gets a look, but Nikola Vucevic had an eye-opening week. And because of that, he is The Denver Post’s NBA player of the week.

What’s up: In four games, Vucevic averaged 27.5 points, 12.0 rebounds and 2.3 assists as the Magic went 2-2. He shot 63.6 percent from the field.

Background: In four NBA seasons, Vucevic has been a steady climber, and this season he’s starting to gain the attention that his game deserves. A double-double machine, he leads the league in the category this season. One of his most significant “doubles” came in a win over the Chicago Bulls on Jan. 12. He had 33 points and 11 rebounds as he wreaked havoc on a formidable Bulls frontcourt of Pau Gasol and Joakim Noah. Two nights later, Vucevic posted 25 points and 12 rebounds against Dwight Howard in Orlando’s win over the Rockets.

Dempsey’s take: Vucevic is one of my favorite players. He’s not a household name, but he might become one. He’s so consistent for a young player, and while NBA teams know about him, he still gets his numbers almost every night. He’s as tough as they come in the paint and always stays on an even keel. It’s just a pleasure to watch a player go out and do his job every night. He’s part of a talented, young nucleus of players at Orlando that has that team on the rise.
