The action is at odds with the public stance of all four potential candidates, who have blasted the law as an unprecedented expansion of government and called for its repeal.\n\nThese governors are each trying to run for president based on in part publicly opposing the Affordable Care Act, but privately they are hypocritically gobbling up millions of federal dollars to fund the law that they have sworn to destroy. The behavior of the governors illustrates that Obamacare has become a buzzword for rallying Republican voters, but the reality is that repealing the ACA would cause absolute chaos at multiple levels of government.\n\nWalker, Perry, Jindal, and Christie all claim that they hate the healthcare law, but that hatred hasn\u2019t stopped them from putting their hands out and taking hundreds of millions of federal dollars. The key is that the governors were not forced to take the money. They had to apply for the funds. It wasn\u2019t a mistake that they took the loot. Walker and the others intentionally asked for it.\n\nThe last two Republican presidential primary contests have quickly devolved into who hissy fights over who is the most conservative candidate. It is going to be difficult for the Obamacare hypocrite governors to wear the crown of real conservative while they were mooching hundreds of millions of dollars in Obamacare cash.\n\nRepublicans hate Obamacare, but not as much as they love free money.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A review of records has found that Republican governors Scott Walker (WI), Bobby Jindal (LA), Rick Perry (TX), and Chris Christie (NJ) took $400 million in federal health care money for their states while opposing the Affordable Care Act.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Jason Easley", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "A review of records has found that Republican governors Scott Walker (WI), Bobby Jindal (LA), Rick Perry (TX), and Chris Christie (NJ) took $400 million in federal health care money for their states while opposing the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Four Anti-Obamacare Republican Governors Took $352 Million In Health Care Grants", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2015/04/01/anti-obamacare-republican-governors-352-million-health-care-grants.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/walker-perry.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-04-01T15:05:30+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Editors' Picks,Featured News,Issues,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Issues", "published_time": "2015-04-01T15:05:30+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-01T15:05:30+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "A review of records has found that Republican governors Scott Walker (WI), Bobby Jindal (LA), Rick Perry (TX), and Chris Christie (NJ) took $400 million in federal health care money for their states while opposing the Affordable Care Act.\nThe last two Republican presidential primary contests have quickly devolved into who hissy fights over who is the most conservative candidate.\nIt is going to be difficult for the Obamacare hypocrite governors to wear the crown of real conservative while they were mooching hundreds of millions of dollars in Obamacare cash.\nThe key is that the governors were not forced to take the money.\nRepublicans hate Obamacare, but not as much as they love free money."}
