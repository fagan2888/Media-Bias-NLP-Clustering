But people should stop to ask whether Trump is a conservative or if he\u2019s using the crowded GOP field to promote himself. There\u2019s also the entire \u201cTrump is a Democrat plant\u201d theory rolling around, which may or may not be true. But let\u2019s take a look at some of the stances he took during the first prime-time debate.\n\nTrump was asked by Bret Baier why he supported single-payer in 2000. Here\u2019s his answer.\n\nAs far as single payer, it works in Canada. It works incredibly well in Scotland. It could have worked in a different age, which is the age you\u2019re talking about here. What I\u2019d like to see is a private system without the artificial lines around every state\u2026Get rid of the artificial lines and you will have\u2026\u2014 yourself great plans. And then we have to take care of the people that can\u2019t take care of themselves. And I will do that through a different system.\n\nHere\u2019s the problem: the single-payer systems in Scotland and Canada aren\u2019t working. The Fraser Institute did a study on wait times in Canada, which found people waited a LONG time to see a specialist after seeing a general practitioner (emphasis mine).\n\nWaiting for treatment has become a defining characteristic of Canadian Healthcare\u2026Specialist physicians surveyed report a median waiting time of 18.2 weeks between referral from a general practitioner and receipt of treatment. This wait time is 96% longer than in 1993 when it was just 9.3 weeks. There is a great deal of variation in the total waiting time faced by patients across the provinces. Ontario reports the shortest total wait (14.1 weeks), while New Brunswick reports the longest (37.3 weeks).\n\nAs far as Scotland is concerned, Avik Roy at Forbes writes why that single-payer system isn\u2019t working \u201cincredibly well,\u201d especially for cancer patients.\n\nIf you\u2019re diagnosed with breast cancer in the U.S., you have an 84 percent chance of living for five years. In Scotland, it\u2019s 71 percent. If you have colon cancer in the U.S., you have about a 60 percent chance of surviving five years. In Scotland, it\u2019s 46 percent. If you have prostate cancer in the U.S., you have a 92 percent chance of living five years; in Scotland, it\u2019s 48 percent.\n\nSounds fantastic right? It\u2019s true Trump talked about getting rid of state lines for insurance companies, which isn\u2019t a bad idea. But he also talked about taking care of those who can\u2019t afford it. This suggests a government-run system of some kind, whether it\u2019s Medicaid or single-payer or Obamacare. The U.S. already has a single-payer system: it\u2019s called the VA system. How\u2019s THAT going? If Trump was a \u201cconservative\u201d he\u2019d be more interested in letting people buy whatever insurance they wanted without a government mandate. Or trying to figure out how to get it back to doctors prescribing their own prices without worry about the insurance companies at all.\n\nTrump also admitted to buying and selling politicians.\n\nTRUMP: I will tell you that our system is broken. I gave to many people, before this, before two months ago, I was a businessman. I give to everybody. When they call, I give.\n\nAnd do you know what? When I need something from them two years later, three years later, I call them, they are there for me. Baier: So what did you get? TRUMP: And that\u2019s a broken system. Baier: What did you get from Hillary Clinton and Nancy Pelosi? TRUMP: Well, I\u2019ll tell you what, with Hillary Clinton, I said be at my wedding and she came to my wedding. You know why? She didn\u2019t have a choice because I gave. I gave to a foundation that, frankly, that foundation is supposed to do good. I didn\u2019t know her money would be used on private jets going all over the world.\n\nNote he didn\u2019t say what he got from Nancy Pelosi. This is a fundamental problem. Trump can rail all he wants about the broken system (and it is broken). But talking about it and participating in it are two different things. And Trump is admitting to participating in it. Here\u2019s the other thing about buying and selling politicians. It doesn\u2019t have to involve political donations at all. Amity Shlaes wrote in her biography on Calvin Coolidge how people wanted to use their presidential connections to gain influence.\n\nEven old friends could not resist exploiting the advantage of knowing a president. After he joined the Congregational Church in Washington, his family minister, Kenneth Welles, at the Edwards Church, could not conceal his glee at the power derived from being able to claim a president in the fold. In a letter to the president, Welles got specific on the power Coolidge\u2019s step would give him to get support from the congregants: \u201cIt is going to give me a grip on some men like Gred Garrar and Judge Field which I never otherwise would have that.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s from a minister! Anyone remember the Ohio Gang involving Coolidge\u2019s predecessor, Warren G. Harding? These were people who were friends of Harding who became political leaders. Trump has already talked about putting friends in charge of the VA system. Who\u2019s to say he\u2019s not going to do the same thing as Harding? Trump has used political connections to seize houses through eminent domain, including one from an elderly widow in Atlantic City. Since she wouldn\u2019t sell, he used the New Jersey government to seize it. The government got tax dollars in return. Favor for favor.\n\nGet past his rhetoric on illegal immigration. From a political standpoint, do we really want a president who thinks single-payer would have worked and admits to buying and selling politicians? Remember, Obama promised reform too, and then went out and rewarded his friends. Trump isn\u2019t a conservative and to paint him as one is ridiculous. There\u2019s a ton of anger out there and all Trump is doing is tapping into it by pretending to be a populist. But there\u2019s a big difference between channeling anger into actually trying to solve the problem (and being very direct with it) and just giving in to rage. Trump is hoping people will just stay angry all the way to the White House (if he\u2019s really serious about this run at all) so he can put in big government solutions and hand out favors. That\u2019s not what a \u201ctrue conservative\u201d is. Those claiming otherwise just need to stop.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Stop peddling lies.", "title": "No, Donald Trump is not a \u201ctrue conservative\u201d", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2015/08/09/no-donald-trump-is-not-a-true-conservative/", "image": "http://media.hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/defendthedonald.png", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@JazzShaw"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-09T21:01:44+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-10T01:24:25+00:00"}, "keywords": "2016 election, GOP, GOP Debate, trump,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "article_summary": "It\u2019s true Trump talked about getting rid of state lines for insurance companies, which isn\u2019t a bad idea.\nThat\u2019s not what a \u201ctrue conservative\u201d is.\nThe U.S. already has a single-payer system: it\u2019s called the VA system.\nBut people should stop to ask whether Trump is a conservative or if he\u2019s using the crowded GOP field to promote himself.\nThere\u2019s also the entire \u201cTrump is a Democrat plant\u201d theory rolling around, which may or may not be true."}
