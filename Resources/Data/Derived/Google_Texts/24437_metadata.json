Much airtime has been devoted to white or refined grains vs. the more nutritionally sound whole variety. The Whole Grain Council stamp of approval identifies food items up and down the grocery aisles. And more and more people have even learned how to pronounce quinoa (KEEN-wah).\n\nAlthough quinoa has asserted its position as the golden girl of whole grains, there is another grain that deserves a chance in the spotlight: millet. It seems like most Americans either haven\u2019t heard of millet or associate it with birdseed, (Technically, it is a seed, though it is usually categorized as a grain because it is cooked and eaten like one). Yet according to the \u201cThe New Food Lover\u2019s Companion,\u201d millet feeds a third of the world\u2019s population. Come on, America: Catch on.\n\nMillet is gluten-free, non-acid-forming and non-allergenic, so it\u2019s a fantastic option for people following a gluten-free diet or wrestling with digestive issues. It also contains the following nutrients:\n\n\u25cf protein (tissue-building)\n\n\u25cf iron (blood-building)\n\n\u25cf B vitamins (energy-providing)\n\n\u25cf magnesium (heart-healthy)\n\n\u25cf phosphorus (bone- and teeth-strengthening)\n\n\u25cf insoluble fiber (aiding in digestion and the absorption of nutrients)\n\nBut even more important, millet tastes good, with a mildly sweet flavor very similar to that of corn or grits. It is also an incredibly versatile food.\n\nUses for millet\n\n\u25cf Make morning millet porridge with almond milk, cinnamon and peaches.\n\n\u25cf Add the cooked whole grain to soup in lieu of rice or barley.\n\n\u25cf If your kids like macaroni and cheese, replace the less healthful pasta with millet. Just add butter and grated Parmesan.\n\n\u25cf Pop it in a skillet (like corn kernels) to make a healthful snack.\n\n\u25cf Use millet flour in bread and muffin recipes (start by replacing a quarter of the flour and increase the proportion if you like the flavor and consistency).\n\n\u25cf Toss with olive oil and salt, or add your favorite vegetables, nuts and dried fruit to make a millet salad.\n\n\u25cf Replace couscous with this wheat-free alternative.\n\n\u25cf Instead of grits, whip up creamy millet.\n\nThese are a modern take on the corn muffin -- with a bit more depth, crunch and flavor.\n\nMAKE AHEAD: The muffins can be covered and stored at room temperature for 2 or 3 days, or refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 1 week.\n\nIngredients (makes 12 muffins)\n\n\u2022 2 1/4 cups whole-wheat pastry flour\n\n\u2022 1/3 cup raw millet\n\n\u2022 1 teaspoon baking powder\n\n\u2022 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt\n\n\u2022 1 cup regular or nonfat plain yogurt\n\n\u2022 2 large eggs\n\n\u2022 1/2 cup melted unsalted butter\n\n\u2022 1/2 cup honey\n\n\u2022 1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest plus the juice of 1 lemon\n\n\u2022 1/2 cup dried or fresh cranberries (optional)\n\nMethod\n\nPreheat the oven to 400 degrees. Butter a 12-well muffin pan or line with paper liners. Whisk together the pastry flour, millet, baking powder and salt in a mixing bowl. Whisk together the yogurt, eggs, melted butter, honey, lemon zest and juice in a separate bowl until well incorporated. Pour the yogurt mixture into the flour-millet mixture, stirring just until the dry ingredients are well blended. Stir in the cranberries, if using.\n\nDivide the batter equally among the muffin wells. Bake for 15 to 17 minutes; the muffins won't brown much, but the tops will be cracked. Serve warm or at room temperature. Cool completely before storing.\n\nSource: Adapted from Heidi Swanson's \"Super Natural Every Day: Well-Loved Recipes from My Natural Foods Kitchen\" (Ten Speed Press, 2011).", "article_metadata": {"wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}, "description": "Millet feeds a third of the world's population, but Americans are lagging behind"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcaf8d\"", "article_summary": "Uses for millet\u25cf Make morning millet porridge with almond milk, cinnamon and peaches.\nAlthough quinoa has asserted its position as the golden girl of whole grains, there is another grain that deserves a chance in the spotlight: millet.\nWhisk together the pastry flour, millet, baking powder and salt in a mixing bowl.\n\u25cf Use millet flour in bread and muffin recipes (start by replacing a quarter of the flour and increase the proportion if you like the flavor and consistency).\n\u25cf Toss with olive oil and salt, or add your favorite vegetables, nuts and dried fruit to make a millet salad."}
