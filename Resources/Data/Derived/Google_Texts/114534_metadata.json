But Oregon has tried to immunize itself against the King v. Burwell decision.\n\nUS Bureau of Labor Statistics\n\nIt\u2019s a decision that could play havoc with the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBut Oregon is trying to sidestep the problem.\n\nRep. Mitch Greenlick, D-Portland, said Oregon\u2019s Legislature dealt with King v. Burwell when it wrote a new law transferring Cover Oregon to the feds.\n\n\u201cWe designed it with very careful advice from our attorneys to make certain that as a federally supported state exchange, our citizens would be covered regardless of which way King v. Burwell would come out,\u201d he said.\n\nWhether Oregon\u2019s efforts are successful, depend largely on the court\u2019s decision. But a few other states including Delaware, Nevada and New Mexico are trying similar side steps.\n\nAbout 7 million people across more than 30 states are eligible for these tax subsidies. If they can no longer get them, many won\u2019t be able to afford insurance anymore. And without them, prices would rise for everyone else.\n\nObama administration officials say the\u2019\u2019re not doing any \u201ccontingency planing.\u201d\n\nBut if the court rules for opponents of the Affordable Care Act, the administration could help states establish their own exchanges, by loosening requirements.\n\nThe question is does \u201cthe state\u201d mean individual states like Oregon, or government in general, as in \u201cthe state?\u201d Congress could develop a fix by clarifying what they meant by \u201cthe state,\u201d but that would require cooperation across party lines.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act says subsidies should flow to customers through an exchange established by \u201cthe state.\u201d\n\nOpponents of the act argue that \u201cthe state\u201d means only people enrolled through state-run marketplaces can get subsidies, and not people buying from the federal marketplace.\n\nYou can listen to Kristian\u2019s conversation with OPB\u2019s All Things Considered host Kate Davidson above.", "article_metadata": {"author": "Kristian Foden-Vencil", "og": {"url": "http://www.opb.org/news/article/oregon-hopes-to-sidestep-us-supreme-court-health-care-decision/", "image": "http://www.opb.org/images/upload/c_fill,h_300,q_90,w_400/moqg3iuad6ikbwzejbhy.jpg", "description": "The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to rule soon on a key aspect of the Affordable Care Act.
