Rosa DeLauro, D-3, as chairwoman of the appropriations subcommittee that funds the Food and Drug Administration, twice has seen firsthand the working conditions and the near impossibility of spotting food safety issues in the poultry industry.\n\nThe movement of the birds on a conveyor belt has been about 140 per minute, but the plans are now to speed that up to 175, DeLauro said.\n\nAdded to that, federal inspectors are being let go and industry inspectors are setting the performance standards for contaminants. \u201cWe are giving over our jurisdiction to the industry,\u201d DeLauro said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe industry has a chokehold. We are hamstrung. They don\u2019t want any regulation. They don\u2019t want any standards,\u201d DeLauro said, as the FDA remains starved for funds,\n\nThe congresswoman said it is emblematic of what is happening \u201cover and over again\u201d across the government as watchdog powers are weakened.\n\nDeLauro, 71, who is running for her 13th term in Congress, is known for her passionate approach to her job, particularly on food safety, social service and health issues. Her Republican opponent is James Brown of Stratford.\n\nShe said she still manages to get things done, however, despite the \u201ctoxic\u201d atmosphere in Washington, D.C. The 113th Congress is on track to be least productive in 60 years, according to Roll Call.\n\nDeLauro, in her 24 years in the U.S. House of Representatives, said she had plenty of philosophical disagreements over the years with her colleagues, but early on there was a different attitude about their role.\n\nIn 1990s, when Newt Gingrich was the House speaker, he and the congresswoman were not sharing the same talking points.\n\n\u201cBut Newt Gingrich had, and I believe still has, a great respect for the institution and believes that it can make changes. ... So many of the new people who have been elected to the Congress in the last few years, they don\u2019t believe in the institution. They have come to dismantle the institution. They don\u2019t believe there is a role for what we do,\u201d DeLauro said.\n\nThe congresswoman, with one short hiatus, has worked in government since she graduated from college, following in the footsteps of her parents, Luisa and Ted DeLauro, who were active in community affairs in New Haven were she grew up in the Wooster Square neighborhood.\n\nShe said the No. 1 issue remains the economy and there are a number of things she has advocated to move that along, including an infrastructure bank that would partner public and private resources for energy, transportation and other investments, creating jobs that can\u2019t be outsourced.\n\nDeLauro said she has helped get training funds for high school tech students to go into manufacturing jobs and tax credits for that industry.\n\nConnecticut has been the recipient over the years of $82 million in TIGER grants all connected to construction projects and economic development in New Haven, Stamford, New London, Bridgeport and Waterbury.\n\nWhat started as a $1 billion-plus national investment across the country is now down to $100 million in the House. \u201cYou can\u2019t do anything with that,\u201d DeLauro said.\n\nWith the world now facing the threat of Ebola, Congress fails to see the connection between funding for biomedical research until there is crisis, she said.\n\nDeLauro said funds to the National Institutes of Health have been cut 10 percent; the Center for Disease Control is down 8 percent in its operating budget, while its preparedness budget is down 16 percent. In the Department of Health and Human Service, its hospital preparedness program has been cut 44 percent.\n\nShe said the lack of investment also applies to education and worker training.\n\n\u201cYou can go down the line. This wasn\u2019t the case in the past,\u201d she said, pointing to the vote to cut off an extension of unemployment benefits.\n\n\u201cPeople are roadkill today,\u201d DeLauro said.\n\nPart of it she said is to oppose anything proposed by President Barack Obama.\n\n\u201cThe immediate response is \u2018no\u2019 and it is a cynical reason, because the view is ... if there is chaos, if there is division ... then that inures to your electoral success come the mid-term elections,\u201d she said.\n\nStill, the congresswoman said, \u201cyou don\u2019t get frustrated, you don\u2019t get tired and can\u2019t sit on the sidelines. You go around it.\u201d\n\nLast year, in dealing with the budget, she said she was able to get increased funds for mental health programs, Title I, special education, job training and early childhood funds.\n\nAnother success was stopping the purchase of Russian helicopters. \u201cAt the same time they are supplying Syria, at the same time we are looking at sanctions on Russia, how do we find our way clear to buying helicopters from them?\u201d she asked.\n\nOn the trade agreements generally, DeLauro said \u201cwe shouldn\u2019t be sending jobs overseas\u201d given the disaster of 800,000 jobs leaving the country under NAFTA.\n\nThe proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement is essentially dead in the water given lack of transparency offered to the Congress on terms of the deal and the lack of guarantees on environmental and safety issues.\n\nDeLauro said part of that agreement covers seafood from Vietman, where shipments have been stopped 200 times and the products found to have deteriorated or be contaminated with pesticides.\n\nShe said signing an agreement would mean its safety standards would be recognized as equivalent to the United States rules.\n\n\u201cAs members of Congress, we do not have the whole agreement,\u201d DeLauro said. \u201cWe need a new paradigm.\u201d\n\nOn getting involved in Syria with the advancement of Islamic State militants, she said she is all right with airstrikes, but no U.S. troops. DeLauro would welcome a full-blown debate, but House Speaker John Boehner won\u2019t call for one.\n\nHer longtime presence in the Congress means some things take time. She started working on restaurants posting calories on their menus in 2003.\n\nShe said she was viewed as the \u201ccrazy aunt in the attic\u201d on the issue, but she worked with the industry for years to get the changes because it is better for people\u2019s health.\n\n\u201cYou can go an look at it and say, \u2018Hell, I have had such a bad day, I don\u2019t care what it is, I\u2019m just going to load up,\u2019 or you say \u2018this is better than this,\u2019\u201d she said of weighing the calorie count.\n\nAs she runs for a 13th term, DeLauro said: \u201cI love what I do.\u201d\n\nShe said it affords her the ability to participate in the essence \u201cof what the Congress is about.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s real strength ... is its potential. It is startling. You take a look at it historically. Civil rights. G.I Bill. Social Security. Medicare. The Affordable Care Act \u2014 a triumph. The ability of sons and daughters of working families to be able to go to school. Education was only in the purview of the rich, not that long ago,\u201d she said of government loans.\n\nDeLauro said Congress doesn\u2019t live up to its potential all the time, but at its best \u201cit provides an opportunity for people to succeed.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Politics, Politics news, New Haven Politics news, CT Politics news, US Politics news, world Politics news.", "title": "Rosa DeLauro seeking 13th term in Congress, fighting \u2018toxic\u2019 atmosphere in Washington", "og": {"url": "http://www.nhregister.com/article/NH/20141010/NEWS/141019943", "image": {"width": "1268px", "identifier": "http://www.nhregister.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/NH/20141010/NEWS/141019943/AR/0/AR-141019943.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "1500px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Rosa DeLauro seeking 13th term in Congress, fighting \u2018toxic\u2019 atmosphere in Washington"}, "twitter": {"domain": "nhregister.com", "description": "NEW HAVEN >> How many members of Congress visit a chicken slaughterhouse as part of their research?", "title": "Rosa DeLauro seeking 13th term in Congress, fighting \u2018toxic\u2019 atmosphere in Washington", "url": "http://www.nhregister.com/article/NH/20141010/NEWS/141019943", "image": {"src": "http://www.nhregister.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/NH/20141010/NEWS/141019943/AR/0/AR-141019943.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@nhregister", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id568468308", "iphone": "id520203861", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.newhavenregister"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"admins": 18506000}, "keywords": "Politics, Politics news, New Haven Politics news, CT Politics news, US Politics news, world Politics news.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "NEW HAVEN >> How many members of Congress visit a chicken slaughterhouse as part of their research?"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe are giving over our jurisdiction to the industry,\u201d DeLauro said.\nDeLauro said Congress doesn\u2019t live up to its potential all the time, but at its best \u201cit provides an opportunity for people to succeed.\u201d\nDeLauro, 71, who is running for her 13th term in Congress, is known for her passionate approach to her job, particularly on food safety, social service and health issues.\nShe said she still manages to get things done, however, despite the \u201ctoxic\u201d atmosphere in Washington, D.C.\nStill, the congresswoman said, \u201cyou don\u2019t get frustrated, you don\u2019t get tired and can\u2019t sit on the sidelines."}
