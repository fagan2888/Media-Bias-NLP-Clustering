But is that mainly because prosecutors sympathize with cops within their jurisdictions or because such incidents tend to be ambiguous and it\u2019s hard to convict an officer when testimony conflicts?\n\nLike it or not, the second explanation is probably closer to the truth. Which is one of the reasons why a plan by some lawmakers to mandate a special prosecutor in cop cases is a bad idea.\n\nA few years ago Westword examined police shootings in Denver over a period of 12 years and found 86 cases in which an officer shot a citizen, 40 of whom died. \u201cWhile some of these instances resulted in departmental discipline,\u201d the report noted, \u201cnot one of the officers involved was charged with excessive force.\u201d\n\nNo, they weren\u2019t. On the other hand, as Westword also found, \u201cThe majority of these [shootings] involved situations where the individual was clearly pointing a gun at officers, putting their lives at risk.\u201d Jurors aren\u2019t naive. They realize police have to make split-second decisions to protect their own safety, and can make an honest mistake about the threat. If an officer\u2019s story is remotely plausible, he\u2019ll probably get the benefit of the doubt.\n\nThe Denver district attorney did charge a cop in 1993 for shooting an unarmed man. He was tried and acquitted. The DA also took the tragic death of Frank Lobato, shot in bed after Officer Ranjan Ford allegedly mistook a soda can for a gun, to a grand jury in 2004, but it declined to indict.\n\nA few years later, the Denver DA filed assault charges against Officer Chuck Porter, an utterly unsavory rogue who stomped on a teen\u2019s back, was fired by the city and cost taxpayers $885,000 in a legal settlement. And yet Porter was acquitted.\n\nI do think DAs ought to bring criminal charges against officers more often than they do, even if the odds of conviction aren\u2019t high. Why on Earth, for example, wasn\u2019t Denver Sheriff Deputy Thomas Ford charged with assault after he punched and kicked a jail inmate in July in an incident that can be seen on video? It\u2019s not like his superiors thought Ford was within his rights. They fired him.\n\nBut the man who chose not to charge Ford, DA Mitch Morrissey, is ultimately accountable to voters. Do we really want prosecutors who are unaccountable making these decisions? And why would we suppose a special prosecutor\u2019s rulings would be notably different?\n\nOne of the most notorious police shootings in the past 20 years occurred in 1999 when a Denver SWAT team broke into the wrong house and shot a Mexican immigrant to death. The case was turned over to the Jefferson County DA, who eventually supported the officers\u2019 version of events.\n\nBoulder County DA Stan Garnett offers another concern. \u201cWhat if the attorney general is particularly partisan,\u201d he wonders, and yet is tasked with such cases? App0inting an outside DA could raise similar issues, he told me. How would Douglas County react to a Democrat filling the role, or Boulder to a Republican? Boulder voters elected Democrat Garnett because that\u2019s who they want making these calls.\n\nGeorge Brauchler, DA in the 18th Judicial District, told me he\u2019s irritated with \u201chow dominant Denver\u2019s issues become for the rest of the state. We\u2019re going to create a solution to a perceived problem in Denver that\u2019s going to apply statewide?\u201d\n\nWell, we shouldn\u2019t \u2014 because the solution probably wouldn\u2019t do much good anyway.\n\nE-mail Vincent Carroll at vcarroll@denverpost.com.\n\nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Carroll: Why aren\u2019t cops prosecuted?", "title": "Carroll: Why aren\u2019t cops prosecuted?", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/01/02/carroll-why-arent-cops-prosecuted/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-02T15:58:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-02T15:58:17+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "But the man who chose not to charge Ford, DA Mitch Morrissey, is ultimately accountable to voters.\nThe case was turned over to the Jefferson County DA, who eventually supported the officers\u2019 version of events.\nBoulder County DA Stan Garnett offers another concern.\nA few years ago Westword examined police shootings in Denver over a period of 12 years and found 86 cases in which an officer shot a citizen, 40 of whom died.\nIt\u2019s true that police in Colorado are rarely prosecuted for the use of excessive force."}
