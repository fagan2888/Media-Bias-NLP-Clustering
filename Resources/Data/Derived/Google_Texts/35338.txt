Crews at the sinkhole by IHOP on North Frontage Road are working through the holidays in order to get things back in order.

Meridian Mayor Percy Bland says new interlocking steel sheets have been put in place on the IHOP side. He says they are 60 feet deep and will prevent any future erosion or problems.

Bland says the crews are digging out the trench so that water can start flowing from Bonita to Sowashee Creek like it should.

"This work is going to take about three to four weeks," said Bland.

Bland says by declaring a state of emergency, crews were able to get to work right away and prevent major problems for restaurants and stores on South Frontage Road.
