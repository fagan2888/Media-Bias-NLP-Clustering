The FBI is now trying to figure out who put a bomb on a rental car returned to Avis Budget Rental on 3400 University Sunday.

The discovery of the bomb, by an Avis employee, brought operations to a halt and now investigators are trying to figure out how it got there.

Judie Miranda got to the Sunport early Sunday morning to pick up a friend, only to be greeted by police and road blocks.

Law enforcement swarmed the airport’ rental car complex

“For an airport it's very scary,” Miranda said. “Oh my god the streets…were police everywhere.”

Albuquerque police confirm a rental car mechanic made the terrifying discovery of an explosive device fixed to the bottom of a rental car return Sunday morning.

Avis Budget employee Susan Russell says the car was one of theirs -- a recently returned Ford Edge.

“We knew right around 8:30 that they found something suspicious under one of our Avis Budget returns,” Russell said.

APD's Bomb Squad is tasked with neutralizing the explosive as FBI and ATF agents take the lead on investigating how it got here.

Miranda says she spent hours consoling rental car workers who were told to stay at their posts.

“I can see the fear that they were having,” she said. “Here you get a bomb threat and they keep them in there. Its sad America has to have this fear. “
