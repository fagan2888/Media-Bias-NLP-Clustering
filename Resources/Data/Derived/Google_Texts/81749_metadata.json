You won\u2019t find many characters in movies or TV that say that what is needed is for the state to be less intrusive and less centralized. So it\u2019s particularly surprising to find one of the most passionate appeals for individual freedom over government encroachment on a television station that was created by an act of the United States Congress and partially funded by the federal government.\n\nThat\u2019s what awaited fans in last night\u2019s episode of Downtown Abbey.\n\nFor the past several weeks Violet Crawley, the Dowager Countess of Grantham, has been opposing a merger of the village hospital with the Royal Yorkshire. The hospital storyline has been rather dull and seemingly inconsequential, especially for the show\u2019s final season. But last night the hospital plot revealed itself to be about something much larger than we might have realized.\n\nThe Dowager\u2019s opponents, most of whom are family members, assumed she was simply resistant to change and was loathe to relinquish any personal power. But as she explains, she has a deeper understanding of government and the duty to protect freedom than anyone had assumed.\n\n\u201cFor years, I\u2019ve watched governments take control of our lives. Their argument is always the same: \u2018Fewer costs, greater efficiency.\u2019 But the result is the same, too. Less control by the people, more control by the State \u2014 until the individual\u2019s anguishes count for nothing. That is what I consider my duty to resist.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour great-grandchildren won\u2019t thank you when the state is all-powerful because we didn\u2019t fight,\u201d adds the Dowager. Indeed, not that the state is very close to being all-powerful we should be thankful for our ancestors from the last century who did fight and managed to hold off big government\u2014at least for awhile.\n\n(Via: Hot Air)", "article_metadata": {"description": "Defenses of limited government are rare in pop culture.
