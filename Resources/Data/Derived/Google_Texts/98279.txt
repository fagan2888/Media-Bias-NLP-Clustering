Hey Longmont,

Join me in welcoming the newest addition to the list of items accepted at the Longmont Waste Diversion Centerâ€”#6 white block foam!

What's THAT, you say? It's white block foam packaging, often referred to as block Styrofoam, stamped with a #6. It's the stuff typically used to ship electronics and other items. White #6 block foam will now be accepted at 140 Martin St. during normal business hours. Please NO packing peanuts, foam cups, "to-go" boxes, meat trays or any other food-grade polystyrene foam. #6 white block foam with tape or moisture will not be accepted.

For questions about this and all new additions, please contact the City of Longmont Public Works department at 303-651-8416. For general questions on this and all hard-to-recycle materials, please visit ecocycle.org or call Eco-Cycle's hotline at 303-444-6634.
