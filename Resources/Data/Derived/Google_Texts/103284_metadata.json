Regulators in New Mexico aren\u2019t jumping on board.\n\nOn Wednesday, the state Public Regulation Commission voted 3-2 to deny a request from a company connected to one of the largest ride-sharing outfits in the nation, Uber, for a certificate to provide \u201cspecialized passenger service.\u201d\n\nThe move comes a little more than a month after the commission issued a cease-and-desist order against Lyft, which is trying to establish a presence in the Albuquerque market.\n\n>>> Seattle\u2019s Rideshare Caps Will Squash Innovators Such as Uber\n\nThe fight centers on whether companies like Uber and Lyft essentially offer the same services as taxis or vans. The ride-sharing companies say they\u2019re fundamentally different, but a majority of the commissioners insist they should be regulated under the Motor Carrier Act.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not exactly a taxi service,\u201d said Paul Melendres, an attorney for a company named Hinter-NM for its UberX program, to commissioners. \u201cWe don\u2019t own the vehicles. [Customers] don\u2019t stand in a taxi line, you don\u2019t hail us.\u201d\n\nBut commissioners Ben Hall, Valerie Espinoza and Theresa Becenti-Aguilar were unmoved and denied the certificate.\n\n\u201cQuit skirting the law,\u201d Espinoza told Melendres.\n\n>>> Massachusetts City Is Latest to Wage War on Ride-Sharing Services\n\nRide-sharing works by allowing customers to download a free smartphone app, which they use to request a ride.\n\nThe app connects them to the nearest available driver and tracks the length of the trip in distance and time, calculates the cost and automatically transfers the fee from the user\u2019s credit card (already entered into the app at the beginning of the process) to the driver\u2019s account. No cash changes hands.\n\nLyft spokeswoman Katie Dally said Lyft drivers work their own schedules and use their own personal vehicles, are properly vetted, licensed and insured.\n\n\u201cTrying to regulate a ride-sharing service like Lyft as if it were a taxi service is trying to put a square peg into a round hole,\u201d said Dally in a telephone interview from San Francisco.\n\nRide-sharing fans accuse cab companies in cities such as Los Angeles and San Francisco as trying to wield influence to snuff out competition. Earlier this month, the Department of Motor Vehicles department in Virginia fined Uber and Lyft for not having \u201cproper operating authority\u201d to do business in the state.\n\n>>> Virginia DMV Attempts to Shutter Ridesharing Companies Uber, Lyft\n\n\u201cRegulations are meant to protect consumers, not create a mythical \u2018level playing field,\u2019\u201d said Paul Gessing, president of the Rio Grande Foundation, a free-market think tank based in Albuquerque. \u201cIf taxis aren\u2019t competitive with Lyft and Uber, then the obvious thing to do is reform regulations to help them compete, not to force Lyft and Uber to adhere to onerous regulations.\u201d\n\nFor now, the majority of New Mexico\u2019s regulation commission disagrees.\n\n\u201cAs a commissioner, I welcome anybody who wants to come in and compete against somebody else as long as they\u2019re doing it legal,\u201d Hall saidafter Wednesday\u2019s meeting. \u201cIf they don\u2019t want to do it legal, then they\u2019re not welcome here as far as I\u2019m concerned.\u201d\n\nCommissioner Pat Lyons, joined by Karen Montoya, voted the other way.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind giving them a temporary service, a temporary solution,\u201d Lyons said. \u201cThe people seem to want this. It\u2019s a new, innovative system.\u201d\n\nThe issue isn\u2019t over, though. Commission staff are looking into adjusting its rules to accommodate ride-sharing companies, but it\u2019s also considering stricter enforcement measures against Lyft and Uber.\n\nLyons said ultimately the state Legislature needs to hammer out a statute for ride-sharing companies. \u201cCompetition is good,\u201d Lyons said. \u201cLet\u2019s create jobs.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "New Mexico's Public Regulation Commission voted 3-2 to deny a request from Ubert connected to operate in the state.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "New Mexico's Public Regulation Commission voted 3-2 to deny a request from Ubert connected to operate in the state.", "title": "Another State Attempts to Block Uber, Lyft", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/140626_NMRideshare_Nikolewski.jpg", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1iyEjDU"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "New Mexico's Public Regulation Commission voted 3-2 to deny a request from Ubert connected to operate in the state.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/140626_NMRideshare_Nikolewski.jpg"}, "title": "Another State Attempts to Block Uber, Lyft", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "transportation", "published_time": "2014-06-26T11:59:47+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "uber, lyft, ride-share, ride-sharing companies, santa fe, new mexico, taxi, motor carrier act"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1c7e\"", "article_summary": "Lyons said ultimately the state Legislature needs to hammer out a statute for ride-sharing companies.\nCommission staff are looking into adjusting its rules to accommodate ride-sharing companies, but it\u2019s also considering stricter enforcement measures against Lyft and Uber.\n>>> Virginia DMV Attempts to Shutter Ridesharing Companies Uber, Lyft\u201cRegulations are meant to protect consumers, not create a mythical \u2018level playing field,\u2019\u201d said Paul Gessing, president of the Rio Grande Foundation, a free-market think tank based in Albuquerque.\nThe ride-sharing companies say they\u2019re fundamentally different, but a majority of the commissioners insist they should be regulated under the Motor Carrier Act.\nEarlier this month, the Department of Motor Vehicles department in Virginia fined Uber and Lyft for not having \u201cproper operating authority\u201d to do business in the state."}
