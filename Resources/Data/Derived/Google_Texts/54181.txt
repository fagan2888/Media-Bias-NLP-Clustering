On Wednesday, Mohegan Sun and the Mohegan Tribal Gaming Authority (MTGA) will make an announcement concerning the acquisition of a professional sports team. Although officials from Mohegan Sun and MTGA have not named the team, sport or league to be purchased, speculation points to the Philadelphia Wings of the National Lacrosse League, an indoor lacrosse league. The Wings are one of the four original teams in the NLL, and recently announced plans to relocate.

Mohegan Sun currently owns the Connecticut Sun, a WNBA team that plays its home games at the Mohegan Sun Arena. An indoor lacrosse team would play in the same facility, which also hosts concerts and other sporting events, including an NLL All-Star Game (in 2002) and three WNBA All-Star Games (2005, 2009, 2013).
