It\u2019s cannibalizing the economy. It\u2019s time for a radical plan.\u201d\n\nI, for one, am feeling a little less alone as a result. We proposed our own \u201cradical\u201d approach to companies like Amazon and Google back in July, which was to treat them as public utilities if we\u2019re not willing to apply antitrust law. It\u2019s good to have Foer\u2019s company in this effort.\n\nPublic utility theory proved remarkably adaptable to corporations like Amazon and Google, at least in theory. But, while the suggestion provoked a predictable string of derisive right-wing responses, there was almost total silence on the left. It\u2019s good to see someone else recognizing the fundamental challenge posed by a company like Amazon, as well as the harm caused by the long-term erosion of our ability to respond to monopolistic threats when they are amplified by the impact of technology.\n\nFoer\u2019s essay has provoked a certain amount of long-overdue discussion in left/liberal circles. The question is, where does that debate go from here?\n\nPerhaps from an excess of caution, Foer opens with a paean to the company\u2019s accomplishments. \u201cBefore we speak ill of Amazon,\u201d he writes, \u201clet us kneel down before it.\u201d Foer tells us that \u201cthe company began with the stated goal of creating a bookstore as comprehensive as the great Library of Alexandria,\u201d adding that it \u201cquickly managed to make even that grandiloquent ambition look puny\u201d and \u201ccould soon conjure the full text of almost any volume onto a phone in less time than a yawn.\u201d He adds that Amazon\u2019s catalogue \u201ccomes damn close to serving every human need \u2026 as cheap as capitalism permits.\u201d\n\nAmazon hasn\u2019t earned those kind words. As Barnes & Noble pointed out in a 1997 lawsuit, Amazon isn\u2019t a bookstore at all. It\u2019s a \u201cbroker\u201d of books, most of which it did not have directly on hand in its early years. It couldn\u2019t \u201csoon conjure\u201d books onto phones. The Kindle platform wasn\u2019t rolled out until 2007, 12 years after Amazon.com went online. And, as Foer himself later suggests, its products are as cheap as monopolistic practices permit.\n\nThese observations aren\u2019t meant to be nitpicking. Rather, it\u2019s important to counteract the quasi-magical aura in which our society enshrouds tech companies. The mythology of their superiority is so deeply ingrained in our culture nowadays that we must resist it wherever it appears.\n\nYes, Jeff Bezos is a smart and very aggressive executive. But the key to Amazon\u2019s early success was government: massive implicit government subsidies (in the form of tax advantages), and the government-created technology platform that empowered it. Amazon moved aggressively, using both of its government-granted advantages, to achieve a monopolistic position as quickly as possible. Then it moved ruthlessly to cement that advantage by crushing or buying all possible competitors.\n\nGenuflection isn\u2019t called for. In fact, strip away the technology and there is nothing in Amazon\u2019s business strategy that wouldn\u2019t be comfortably familiar to a 19th-century robber baron.\n\nFoer goes on to say this: \u201cRather than pocketing the profits from this creation, Amazon has plowed revenue into bettering itself.\u201d This is a misconception I didn\u2019t fully understand myself until I read this response to Foer by economist Dean Baker. Baker writes that \u201cthere were actually few profits to pocket, and what little profits did exist were due to the enormous subsidy Amazon enjoyed from not being required to collect state sales tax \u2026 Amazon has always had very thin profits and has had almost as many losing quarters as profitable ones.\u201d\n\nFoer is on much firmer ground when he\u2019s deftly skewering the ideology of Silicon Valley, noting that libertarian venture capitalist Peter Thiel has even tried to claim that monopolies are something beneficial.\n\nFoer rightly notes that \u201cin effect, we\u2019ve been thrust back 100 years to a time when the law was not up to the task of protecting the threats to democracy posed by monopoly,\u201d following that observation with worthy digressions into the thinking of Louis Brandeis and the shifting focus of antimonopoly efforts from \u201cproducers\u201d to \u201cconsumers.\u201d\n\nThis led to a misplaced riposte from Matt Yglesias arguing that, however many its faults, Amazon is not a monopoly, even for e-books. But a corporation\u2019s monopoly doesn\u2019t need to be absolute in order to trigger legal remedies. It need only be in a position to exert unfair pressure on prices, and to do so, in order to theoretically qualify for antitrust action. Given its predatory behavior toward publishers, its position in the e-book market and its ever-increasing dominance over the physical book market, Amazon clearly qualifies. Annie Lowrey acknowledged Amazon\u2019s monopoly status in the book market but argued that, given the breadth of its offerings, Foer is wrong to characterize it as a monopoly \u201cwrit large.\u201d This argument warrants a detailed rebuttal of its own, but suffice it to say that monopolization is the heart of Amazon\u2019s business strategy. As books have gone, so will other markets go if the corporation has its way.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Amazon drives down wages, avoids taxes and destroys intellectual life, while profiting from government subsidies", "author": "Richard (R.J.)
