A man charged with felony retail theft and violation of state probation in Jackson County is in custody.

Steven Altieri, 33, attempted to leave a Walmart Friday night without paying.

Walmart officials confronted him when he left the store, but he left in a woman's vehicle.

A Jackson County deputy found Altieri on McDuff Dr. in the Highlands of Compass Lake.

Altieri was already convicted of retail and grand theft from robbing a Walmart in Marimar, Florida.

He remains in the Jackson County Correctional Facility until his first appearance in court.
