What is the period of time by which HHS expects these funds to be repaid?\u201d were among the questions presented to Sebelius.\n\nThe questions were raised in a letter from Sens. Orrin Hatch, ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee; Lamar Alexander, ranking member of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee; Michael Enzi, ranking member of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Subcommittee on Children and Families; Tom Coburn, ranking member of the Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee; and Rep. Charles Boustany Jr., chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee on Oversight.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time members of Congress have asked for information about the HHS program called Consumer Operated and Oriented Plans, which has loaned money to non-profit health insurance issuers that offer qualified health plans in the individual and small-group markets.\n\nTwo dozen of those groups have been loaned the money, the members of Congress note, for startup costs and solvency, \u201cwhich help CO-OPs meet state insurance solvency and reserve requirements.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen we wrote to you in May 2012, we noted that there was little evidence that the CO-OP program would promote greater competition and lower costs in most state insurance markets, and we questioned whether HHS had significantly underestimated the financial risk,\u201d the lawmakers wrote.\n\nThey said the \u201cresponses to our letter from CMS Administrator Marilyn Tavenner \u2013 which were delivered on your behalf more than nine months after we sent our letter \u2013 did little to assure us that HHS or CMS was prepared to address these issue.\u201d\n\nThe scanty information that was available was not reassuring, the lawmakers said.\n\nAn inspector general\u2019s report, for instance, said \u201c11 of 16 CO-OPs reported estimated startup expenditures \u2026 that exceeded the total startup funding ultimately provided,\u201d producing a \u201crisk that CO-OPs could exhaust all startup loan funding before they are fully operational or before they earn sufficient operating income to be self-supporting.\u201d\n\nThe lawmakers also note that at least one of the CO-OP plans was denied a license by the state of Vermont to operate.\n\nIn the letter today, they want to know whether the government, on behalf of the $2 billion in tax money, monitored licensing processes and how many have or have not been granted licenses.\n\nThey also want to know when the plans will be operational and if they be within budget.\n\nThey ask for an explanation of the startup costs, what the \u201cproblematic launch\u201d of the Healthcare.gov website mean to the operations, whether or not all the required reports been submitted and whether or not the operations meet their required milestones.\n\n\u201cPlease provide all documents related to (1) the Vermont CO-OP\u2019s failure to obtain an insurance license and (2) HHS\u2019s decision to terminate the Vermont CO-OP loan,\u201d they ask.\n\nEarlier this year, a number of Republican senators asked the Government Accountability Office to conduct an independent audit examining the effectiveness of CO-OPs. The members also requested GAO evaluate efforts by CO-OPs related to covering the uninsured, providing lower-cost plans and repaying loans from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nAre you worried about your health-insurance situation? No, I will be covered under Obamacare if I lose my current coverage\n\nNo, that's just a bunch of Republican hype to stop real health-care reform\n\nNo, even though I may lose it, it makes no sense to worry\n\nNo, I have full confidence Obamacare will soon collapse or be repealed\n\nNo, I expect to get enough subsidies to fund my care at a lower rate\n\nNo, I'm on Medicare\n\nNot really. Under obamacare, we'll all be deprived of treatment and be dead anyway\n\nYes, I lost my insurance and can't afford the plans offered by Obamacare\n\nYes, as soon as the employer mandate hits, I'll be in the same boat as the other 5 million\n\nYes, I am afraid I will lose my insurance and not be able to find an affordable replacement\n\nYes, I am afraid my employer will drop our insurance coverage or make us pay more for it\n\nYes, we're all now vulnerable to the rationing of health care\n\nYes, this is the most stressful concern I have had in years\n\nYes, I fear a massive rate increase no matter what happens\n\nYes, socialized medicine terrifies the hell out of me\n\nOther View Results", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "Several leading Republicans in Congress are asking Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, who is overseeing the disastrous Healthcare.gov website rollout, to explain the $2 billion loaned to various interests to launch health insurance CO-OPs and whether any of that taxpayer money will be recovered.
