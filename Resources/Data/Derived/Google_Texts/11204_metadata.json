It\u2019s the first attempt in two decades to overturn the Hyde Amendment, which for nearly 40 years has prevented Medicaid from covering the cost of abortion with few exceptions.\n\nSimilar bans affect millions of Americans who rely on other federal programs for their health insurance, including federal employees, military personnel and their families, Peace Corp volunteers, Native Americans who use Indian Health Services, federal prisoners, and youth enrolled in the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program. The Equal Access to Abortion Coverage in Health Insurance (EACH Woman) Act would restore abortion coverage to all of them, as well as invalidate state laws restricting coverage of the procedure in private insurance plans.\n\nThe best estimate, according to a 2009 review of the research by the Guttmacher Institute, is that 18 to 37 percent of women on Medicaid who would otherwise get an abortion instead give birth due to the lack of funding.\n\nThough there\u2019s pretty much zero chance of the bill clearing the Republican-controlled Congress, the fact that it was introduced at all represents progress. While the Hyde Amendment was fiercely debated when it was first passed, eventually it came to be framed in Congress as a reasonable compromise \u2014 one that, to the ire of many pro-choice advocates, was re-affirmed by President Obama during passage of the Affordable Care Act. As Irin Carmon notes, \u201cTo opponents of abortion, the phrase \u2018taxpayer funding for abortion\u2019 is practically magic, conjuring both fears about the use of other people\u2019s money and discomfort with abortion.\u201d Meanwhile, most reproductive rights groups, focused on trying to stanch the tidal wave of new anti-choice laws, didn\u2019t think it was worth going on the offensive about Hyde until recently.\n\nNow, though, they see introducing a doomed bill as a way of helping expose how unjust the status quo is. Most people simply aren\u2019t aware of the Hyde Amendment, let alone what a huge hardship it poses to some of the most disadvantaged Americans. Let\u2019s do the math: On average, a first-trimester abortion costs nearly $500 out-of-pocket. Even after the expansion of Medicaid under Obama, it is a program for the extremely poor. In the 29 states that have accepted the expansion, a family of three must make below about $27,700 a year to qualify. In the states that have refused the expansion, the average eligibility limit is less than $9,200 for a family of three, and childless adults don\u2019t qualify at all. In other words, the Hyde Amendment ensures that, in many states, mothers who are getting by on less than $800 a month are one broken condom away from being forced to pay, at minimum, more than half that in order to avoid having another child.\n\nIf that seems like a nearly impossible calculus, that\u2019s because it\u2019s supposed to be. It\u2019s no secret that the intention of the Hyde Amendment was to keep women from getting abortions. Just take it from then-Congressman Henry Hyde when he made his case for the policy on the House floor back in 1977: \u201cI certainly would like to prevent, if I could legally, anybody having an abortion, a rich woman, a middle-class woman, or a poor woman. Unfortunately, the only vehicle available is the \u2026 Medicaid bill.\u201d The Supreme Court put it slightly more delicately when it declared the policy constitutional in 1980, deciding that the government could choose to \u201cencourage\u201d childbirth over abortion by paying for the former but not the latter.\n\nSo how many women have been \u201cencouraged\u201d to carry an unwanted pregnancy to term thanks to the policy? The best estimate, according to a 2009 review of the research by the Guttmacher Institute, is that 18 to 37 percent of women on Medicaid who would otherwise get an abortion instead give birth due to the lack of funding. Over the past 39 years, that has amounted to more than one million people who have been unable to exercise a constitutionally protected right solely because of their economic status. (Or, in the gleeful language of the anti-choice side, 1.1 million Americans are alive today because of the Hyde Amendment.)\n\nIn truth, it\u2019s somewhat surprising that it\u2019s not more. In part, that\u2019s because 17 states use their own funds to provide the coverage for their Medicaid enrollees. It\u2019s also thanks to local abortion funds that have sprung up across the country to fill the gap. In recent years, the National Network of Abortion Funds has distributed about $3 million annually to nearly 30,000 women seeking abortions who otherwise couldn\u2019t afford one.\n\nMostly, though, it speaks to the great lengths people are willing to go to in order to get an abortion when they need one. Abortion funds typically don\u2019t pay the full amount of the procedure; they make up the difference after a woman has cobbled together as much money as she can. Interviews with the patients show the sacrifices it takes to raise a few hundred dollars in just weeks when you\u2019re living paycheck to paycheck. They report borrowing money from multiple relatives, working extra hours, delaying paying other bills, pawning possessions, and cutting back on food and other necessities.\n\nAs a study by researchers from the Guttmacher Institute and Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health concludes, \u201c[R]ather than assuming responsibility for the public\u2019s health, governments \u2014 both state and federal \u2014 have privatized the costs of exercising the constitutional right to abortion to women, their communities, and the private donors who support abortion funds.\u201d In this regard, abortion is similar to other necessary social goods \u2014 like, for instance, food \u2014 that are increasingly provided by networks of overburdened charities doing their best to fill the holes in our tattered safety net.\n\nBut the stakes are especially high when it comes to abortion. Given how challenging it is to raise the funds, it\u2019s no surprise that poor women tend to get their abortions two to three weeks later than average. Two-thirds of them say they wanted to get the procedure earlier \u2014 and that\u2019s not just because of the usual psychological stress of being pregnant when you don\u2019t want to be. The cost of an abortion \u2014 in addition to the risks \u2014 increases substantially the later into pregnancy you get. After you cross into the second trimester, what was once a $500 procedure steadily climbs to two to three times as much. In other words, the longer it takes to gather the money for an abortion you can\u2019t afford, the more unaffordable it becomes.\n\nOf course, even a $1,500 procedure at 20 weeks is less expensive than raising a kid, which is probably why most women do whatever it takes to win this desperate race against the clock. After all, that\u2019s typically the reason they\u2019re choosing to end their pregnancy to begin with: Three-fourths of all the women who have abortions in the United States \u2014 40 percent of whom are living below the federal poverty level \u2014 say they got one because they could not afford a child. A research project out of the University of California\u2013San Francisco shows the devastating economic consequences for those who lose the race. The ongoing study, following more than 1,000 women, is comparing those who had passed the gestational cut-off \u2014 and, thus, were turned away from clinics \u2014 to a similar group who just made the deadline. Those who were denied abortions were three times more likely to end up below the federal poverty level two years later.\n\n\u201cI certainly would like to prevent, if I could legally, anybody having an abortion, a rich woman, a middle-class woman, or a poor woman. Unfortunately, the only vehicle available is the \u2026 Medicaid bill.\u201d\n\nBy drawing attention to harsh consequences like that, the pro-choice movement is hoping that it can put supporters of the Hyde Amendment on the defensive. While abortion funding has been seen as something of a third rail, the public doesn\u2019t seem to be as convinced that poor women should be forced into childbirth as the conservative rhetoric around \u201ctaxpayer-funded abortions\u201d would suggest. A new poll of voters, which oversampled young people, commissioned by All* Above All (a coalition of pro-choice organizations pushing to end Hyde) found that nearly 60 percent agreed with the statement: \u201cHowever we feel about abortion, politicians should not be allowed to deny a woman insurance coverage for it just because she is poor.\u201d A majority of voters \u2014 including Republicans \u2014 agreed that \u201cas long as abortion is legal, the amount of money a woman has or does not have should not prevent her from being able to have an abortion.\u201d\n\nMore generally, directly making the case for public funding of abortion is an opportunity to highlight the reality that \u201ca right without access is no right at all,\u201d as then-Senator Edward Brooke concisely put it during early debates on the Hyde Amendment. While there are some rights \u2014 like freedom of speech or worship \u2014 that don\u2019t cost anything to access, the right to abortion is not one of them. Yet, in the U.S., it has been treated, legally and legislatively, as if it is \u2014 as if the government can protect it simply by refraining from outright banning the procedure.\n\nFour decades after Hyde was first passed, the result is a lattice of abortion restrictions that, individually, aren\u2019t severe enough, according to the Supreme Court, to pose an unconstitutional \u201cundue burden\u201d on the right to choose, but, collectively, they conspire to ensure that Americans have wildly divergent abilities to exercise that right in practice. And in a cruel catch-22, it\u2019s those women who can least afford an abortion \u2014 and, worse, can least afford not to get an abortion \u2014 who inevitably have the hardest time accessing one.\n\nThe Gender Gap explores the persisting gender inequalities of the modern age and society\u2019s unwillingness to grapple with them.", "article_metadata": {"description": "by Maya Dusenbery \u00b6\n\nEarlier this month, a group of Democratic Representatives, led by Barbara Lee of California, Jan Schakowsky of Illinois, and Diana DeG\u2026", "title": "Poor Women in the United States Don\u2019t Have Abortion Rights \u2014 Pacific Standard", "og": {"site_name": "Medium", "description": "by Maya Dusenbery \u00b6\n\nEarlier this month, a group of Democratic Representatives, led by Barbara Lee of California, Jan Schakowsky of Illinois, and Diana DeG\u2026", "title": "Poor Women in the United States Don\u2019t Have Abortion Rights \u2014 Pacific Standard", "url": "https://psmag.com/poor-women-in-the-united-states-don-t-have-abortion-rights-2d80217ca4ca", "image": "https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/0*vGJ0sPe4s2llMuMu.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "always", "twitter": {"label1": "Reading time", "image": {"src": "https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/0*vGJ0sPe4s2llMuMu.jpg"}, "site": "@Medium", "data1": "6 mins", "app": {"url": {"iphone": "medium://p/2d80217ca4ca"}, "name": {"iphone": "Medium"}, "id": {"iphone": 828256236}}, "card": "summary"}, "author": "Maya Dusenbery", "al": {"web": {"url": "https://psmag.com/poor-women-in-the-united-states-don-t-have-abortion-rights-2d80217ca4ca"}, "android": {"url": "medium://p/2d80217ca4ca", "app_name": "Medium", "package": "com.medium.reader"}, "ios": {"url": "medium://p/2d80217ca4ca", "app_name": "Medium", "app_store_id": 828256236}}, "fb": {"app_id": 542599432471018, "smart_publish": {"robots": "noauto"}}, "theme-color": "#000000", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/medium", "published_time": "2015-07-28T13:00:00.000Z", "author": "https://psmag.com/@mayadusenbery"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe4014\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI certainly would like to prevent, if I could legally, anybody having an abortion, a rich woman, a middle-class woman, or a poor woman.\n(Or, in the gleeful language of the anti-choice side, 1.1 million Americans are alive today because of the Hyde Amendment.)\nMost people simply aren\u2019t aware of the Hyde Amendment, let alone what a huge hardship it poses to some of the most disadvantaged Americans.\nIt\u2019s no secret that the intention of the Hyde Amendment was to keep women from getting abortions.\nGiven how challenging it is to raise the funds, it\u2019s no surprise that poor women tend to get their abortions two to three weeks later than average."}
