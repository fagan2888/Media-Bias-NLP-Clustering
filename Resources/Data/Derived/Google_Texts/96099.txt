So maybe they aren’t untouchable.

Both Shaun White and Kelly Clark took rare tumbles in the halfpipe Saturday during the Dew Tour finals at Breckenridge. And competitors took advantage of the opportunity to best the best, stepping up with strong runs in what became a day of upsets in the halfpipe.

Bouncing back from a 2012 injury, Mammoth Mountain’s Greg Bretz — a 2010 member of the U.S. Olympic halfpipe squad — threw down a dominant first run that held throughout the best-of-two-runs contest Saturday morning.

“Being able to win this one was a huge sigh of relief,” said Bretz, whose top finish puts him in the lead for a berth on the U.S. Snowboarding halfpipe squad in Sochi. “I can go into the next four contests extremely confident and ready to ride.”

White, who will compete in Sunday’s Dew Tour snowboard slopestyle contest as he vies to make both the U.S.’s pipe and slopestyle teams in Sochi, did not look happy with his silver medal.

“He’s always a poor loser,” Bretz said. “But to me, he didn’t lose. He won second.”

Steamboat Springs’ Taylor Gold delivered confident grabs and the contest’s only double-cork Michalchuk – a double-backflip trick named after snowboarding pioneer Michael Michalchuk – to earn bronze and put the 20-year-old on a fast-track to Sochi.

Australian Torah Bright, the 2010 Winter Olympic gold medalist, took the women’s gold with technical back-to-back alley oops. Clark, who came to Breckenridge on an unrivaled 16-of-17 winning streak, boosted her signature 1080 on her first run but was unable to best Bright’s 95.4 score.

Thirteen-year-old Chloe Kim – a member of the U.S. Rookie Halfpipe Team – set a remarkable tone for her first year on the pro circuit taking bronze with three 720 spins. Although she’s too young to compete in Sochi, Kim is pacing to make an impact on women’s snowboarding.
