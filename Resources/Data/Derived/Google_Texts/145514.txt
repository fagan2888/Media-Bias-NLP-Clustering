Santa was good to Gov. Nikki Haley (R) this year, as the South Carolinian boasted of the pistol she received for Christmas.

The Republican Governor posted a photo of her new gun all across social media, from Facebook to Twitter to Instagram.

“Our family had a wonderful Christmas together! I must have been good Santa gave me a Beretta PX4 Storm,” Haley wrote on Instagram.

The gun retails for approximately $575, according to the company’s website. Magazines for the pistol range from holding 10 rounds to 17 rounds.

A spokesperson for Haley told the Associated Press the gift was a from her husband and said she couldn’t wait to get out on the range to shoot it. Gov. Haley’s office did not return Red Alert Politics’ request for comment by the time of publication.

Haley has been a proponent of the right to bear arms and raised eyebrows after she toured a Columbia, S.C., manufacturing plant for FN, a gun company that produces weapons for the National Guard. Her office released photos and a video of Haley shooting several weapons made by the company.

The first-term governor’s husband, Michael Haley, an officer in the South Carolina National Guard, returned home from an 11-month tour in Afghanistan earlier this month.
