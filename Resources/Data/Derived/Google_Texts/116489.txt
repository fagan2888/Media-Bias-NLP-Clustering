Deadwood, SD

Deadwood city officials are seeking input from the public on a proposed $3.5 million visitor center.



The Deadwood City Commission approved contracting with Chamberlin Architects to build the new center this winter. The proposed design for the center aim to spruce up Deadwood's south entrance and provide a more informative start for visitors.



The visitor center would house the Deadwood Chamber of Commerce. It would also have a community meeting space, year-round restrooms, and space that could be leased for commercial ventures.



Officials will hold a public meeting Tuesday at the Springhill Suites hotel.



The project could start in 2016 if the public likes the proposed designs.
