Attorney General Hector Balderas has cleared almost all of those organizations of criminal wrongdoing, criticism of the decision by the state\u2019s Human Services Department (HSD) to freeze their funding is growing louder. The so-called Medicaid freeze put many longtime New Mexico companies and nonprofits out of business and sparked a tumultuous transition for tens of thousands of New Mexicans dealing with issues including depression and suicidal thoughts.\n\nThe question of why the Martinez Administration froze funding to the organizations \u2014 when it didn\u2019t have to \u2014 remains.\n\nThe four Democratic members of New Mexico\u2019s congressional delegation in Washington want an investigation. Sens. Tom Udall and Martin Heinrich and Reps. Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n and Michelle Lujan Grisham sent a letter to U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell on Friday asking her agency to look into the situation.\n\n\u201cAttorney General Balderas\u2019s findings confirm our longstanding concern that the well-documented irregularities surrounding HSD\u2019s decision to suspend payments, which was not required by federal law, has undermined the legitimacy of its entire audit process,\u201d their letter states. \u201cFurthermore, HSD denied providers\u2019 due process of law by indefinitely withholding payments while taking deliberate steps to preclude providers from challenging the charges against them. This callously disrupted care for New Mexico\u2019s most vulnerable.\u201d Advertisement\n\nThe only Republican in the delegation, U.S. Rep. Steve Pearce, did not sign the letter.\n\nThe Democratic lawmakers wrote that \u201can overwhelming body of evidence indicates that this disruption was unwarranted and reckless.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt takes decades to build a strong system of care in our largely rural, underserved state, where sole providers become vital to the fabric of a community,\u201d the letter states. \u201cFor patients who receive mental health or substance abuse treatment, few things are as important as the ability to regularly see a trusted provider focused on providing quality care.\u201d And although the state claims disruptions in services were nonexistent or minimal, the lawmakers wrote that they have \u201cconsistently heard otherwise.\u201d \u201cAdvocates, patients and their family members have told us alarming stories about losing access to quality care, as doctors and nurses have been laid off and clinics have closed across the state,\u201d they wrote. \u201cOut-of-state contractors initially hired to provide transitional services were unprepared, unlicensed, unfamiliar with their new service areas, and slow to provide the full scope of services patients needed.\u201d Some providers brought in from Arizona to fill the gap created when the state froze funding to the New Mexico organizations didn\u2019t last long. That included Arizona\u2019s La Frontera, which pulled out of Southern New Mexico after calling the entire ordeal a \u201cnightmare.\u201d The local organization La Clinica de Familia has taken over as Do\u00f1a Ana County\u2019s primary Medicaid-funded behavioral health provider, but continues to struggle. \u201cSix months into taking over a range of programs from a previous provider, La Clinica de Familia has placed a freeze on accepting certain new mental health clients until April 1,\u201d the Las Cruces Sun-News reported earlier this month.\n\nThat\u2019s because of a staffing shortage and \u201cappears to be a symptom of ongoing tumult that has characterized the mental health care community since a mid-2013 shakeup sparked by the state ending funding to a number of previous providers,\u201d the newspaper reported.\n\nThe Sun-News blasted the Martinez Administration in a recent editorial.\n\n\u201cThe Martinez administration initially said it was required to immediately freeze funding or risk losing all Medicaid money to the state under new provisions in the Affordable Care Act. As dubious as those claims were at the time, they are completely discredited now that the suspected agencies have been cleared by the attorney general. \u201cWe call on the state to release all funding still owed to the former providers, and to end the ongoing attempts to besmirch those agencies based on what we now know are false allegations. We also urge them to provide La Clinica de Familia with the resources necessary to clean up this mess, which they created.\u201d\n\nMany New Mexicans were equally harsh during discussions NMPolitics.net facilitated on Facebook after Balderas cleared most of the organizations of criminal wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cThis is why due process is so vital to our system of justice,\u201d wrote Christopher Cardenas of Las Cruces. \u201cWithout it the government is just a bully with unlimited power.\u201d\n\nCarol Tuck of Las Cruces agreed.\n\n\u201cI simply do not see a reasonable defense for what happened,\u201d Tuck wrote. \u201cThey rushed to judgment and left some of the most vulnerable people high and dry.\u201d\n\nThe Albuquerque Journal\u2019s editorial board, which is sometimes friendly to Martinez, also called for \u201can independent federal investigation\u201d \u2014 though the newspaper stopped short of criticizing the governor.\n\n\u201cIt should be comprehensive, looking at HSD\u2019s actions, whether fewer, or more, people received services, and the role of the AG\u2019s Office \u2013 especially if the claims are as specious as the providers allege,\u201d the Journal editorial states. \u201cNew Mexicans deserve to know the truth, and taxpayers deserve to know money spent to serve behavioral health clients is used properly.\u201d\n\nIn their letter to Burwell, the four Democratic lawmakers wrote that a \u201cgood faith investigation into this issue is long overdue.\u201d\n\n\u201cNew Mexicans who rely on Medicaid for health coverage \u2014 including behavioral health services \u2014 deserve a health care system that delivers high quality care when they need it most,\u201d Udall, Heinrich, Luj\u00e1n and Grisham wrote. \u201cWe ask that you use your oversight authority to provide such care for New Mexicans.\u201d\n\nThe Martinez Administration called the lawmakers\u2019 letter a \u201cpartisan stunt.\u201d A statement from HSD to KRWG Public Media states, \u201cThe Feds have extensively reviewed this matter and found that the state acted in accordance with the anti-fraud regulations put in place by the Affordable Care Act. \u201d\n\nWhile it\u2019s true that the Martinez Administration had the authority to freeze the Medicaid funding in 2013, the administration has incorrectly insisted ever since that it had no other choice. The question remains: Why did the administration choose a funding freeze that sparked a chaotic transition and disrupted services to some patients before giving law enforcement a chance to determine whether crimes were committed?", "article_metadata": {"description": "The question remains: Why did the Martinez Administration freeze funding to 15 organizations and throw the state's behavioral health system into chaos when it didn't have to?", "original-source": "http://nmpolitics.net/index/2016/02/criticism-of-martinezs-2013-medicaid-freeze-ramps-up/", "og": {"site_name": "NMPolitics.net", "description": "The question remains: Why did the Martinez Administration freeze funding to 15 organizations and throw the state's behavioral health system into chaos when it didn't have to?", "title": "Criticism of Martinez\u2019s 2013 Medicaid freeze ramps up", "url": "http://nmpolitics.net/index/2016/02/criticism-of-martinezs-2013-medicaid-freeze-ramps-up/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://nmpolitics.net/index/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Martinez-Susana.jpg", "height": 350}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@nmpoliticsnet", "card": "summary", "creator": "@haussamen"}, "syndication-source": "http://nmpolitics.net/index/2016/02/criticism-of-martinezs-2013-medicaid-freeze-ramps-up/", "fb": {"app_id": 111489745565143}, "article": {"section": "News and Analysis", "tag": "Washington", "published_time": "2016-02-24T16:31:02+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-14T15:20:36+00:00", "author": "http://nmpolitics.net/index/author/heath-haussamen/"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "News and Analysis, Health care, Hector Balderas, Medicaid freeze, Roundhouse, Susana Martinez, Washington"}, "article_summary": "The question of why the Martinez Administration froze funding to the organizations \u2014 when it didn\u2019t have to \u2014 remains.\n\u201dWhile it\u2019s true that the Martinez Administration had the authority to freeze the Medicaid funding in 2013, the administration has incorrectly insisted ever since that it had no other choice.\n\u201cThe Martinez administration initially said it was required to immediately freeze funding or risk losing all Medicaid money to the state under new provisions in the Affordable Care Act.\nThe Sun-News blasted the Martinez Administration in a recent editorial.\nThe so-called Medicaid freeze put many longtime New Mexico companies and nonprofits out of business and sparked a tumultuous transition for tens of thousands of New Mexicans dealing with issues including depression and suicidal thoughts."}
