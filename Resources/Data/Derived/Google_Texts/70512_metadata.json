In Rubio's home state of Florida, which he represents in the U.S. Senate, 12,000 donors contributed a total of $2.2 million.\n\nIn announcing the fundraising total, Rubio's team boasted of a \"lean\" operation that has allowed the candidate to attend more than 40 events in 17 states while spending just $2.27 million.\n\nIn terms of presidential committee fundraising, that puts Rubio atop the GOP pack. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush raised $11.4 million, although he was only in the race for 16 days of the three-month fundraising period. Other big fundraisers include Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, whose presidential committee brought in $9.9 million in the second quarter, and neurosurgeon Ben Carson, who brought in $8.3 million.\n\nThe super PAC and 501(c)4 organizations supporting Rubio both had big fundraising quarters as well. Conservative Solutions PAC raised $16.1 million and Conservative Solutions Project, the 501(c)4, brought in $15.8 million.\n\nBut no candidate has come close to besting Bush, whose Right to Rise super PAC brought in $103 million since the beginning of the year. Rubio's total presidential and outside group resources of about $45 million put him in third place among Republicans. Cruz has just over $50 million in money raised by his presidential committee and outside PACs, which have raised $37 million to support his bid.", "article_metadata": {"description": "His presidential committee is keeping pace with GOP rivals, but outside group money falls short of other contenders", "og": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/marco-rubio-campaign-12-million/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/07/07/daf24097-5ccf-4409-9fff-6fb02f02041a/thumbnail/1200x630g2/d5cc152d2dcf7b0ae298097c43299e31/ap589796692728.jpg", "height": 630}, "type": "article", "description": "His presidential committee is keeping pace with GOP rivals, but outside group money falls short of other contenders", "title": "Election 2016: Marco Rubio's campaign raises $12 million"}, "twitter": {"description": "His presidential committee is keeping pace with GOP rivals, but outside group money falls short of other contenders", "title": "Election 2016: Marco Rubio's campaign raises $12 million", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "cbsnewsapp://news/marco-rubio-campaign-12-million/", "iphone": "cbsnewsapp://news/marco-rubio-campaign-12-million/", "googleplay": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/marco-rubio-campaign-12-million/"}, "country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "CBS News", "iphone": "CBS News", "googleplay": "CBS News"}, "id": {"ipad": 334256223, "iphone": 334256223, "googleplay": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}}, "site": "@CBSPolitics", "image": "http://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/07/07/daf24097-5ccf-4409-9fff-6fb02f02041a/thumbnail/1200x630g2/d5cc152d2dcf7b0ae298097c43299e31/ap589796692728.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"web": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/marco-rubio-campaign-12-million/"}, "android": {"app_name": "CBS News", "package": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}, "ios": {"url": "cbsnewsapp://news/marco-rubio-campaign-12-million/", "app_name": "CBS News", "app_store_id": 334256223}}, "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"app_id": 1536620209892267}, "keywords": "jeb bush, marco rubio, 2016  gop race, ted cruz, 2016, 2016 campaign, fundraising", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CBSPolitics"}, "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "jeb bush, marco rubio, 2016  gop race, ted cruz, 2016, 2016 campaign, fundraising"}, "article_summary": "Marco Rubio's presidential campaign announced Monday it had raised $12 million in the second fundraising quarter and began July with $9.72 million cash on hand.\nRubio's total presidential and outside group resources of about $45 million put him in third place among Republicans.\nCruz has just over $50 million in money raised by his presidential committee and outside PACs, which have raised $37 million to support his bid.\nOther big fundraisers include Texas Sen.
