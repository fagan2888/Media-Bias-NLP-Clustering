Artists frequently dislike the labels assigned to their work: Philip Glass prefers “music with repetitive structures” to “minimalism,” for example. But the minimalist label has stuck. As part of the Brooklyn Academy of Music’s Next Wave Festival, Mr. Glass will be joined by Steve Reich, another pioneer of the genre, for three programs that illustrate their aesthetic with some of their best-known works. The two ensembles they founded will perform, and for the first time in more than three decades, the two composers will collaborate onstage during several selections.

The lineup on Tuesday includes Mr. Reich’s seminal “Music for 18 Musicians” and excerpts from Mr. Glass’s opera “Akhnaten” and “Music in Twelve Parts.” On Tuesday and Wednesday, the two composers join forces with Nico Muhly and Timo Andres for Mr. Reich’s “Four Organs”; on Wednesday and Thursday, Mr. Reich will join the Philip Glass Ensemble for Mr. Glass’s “Music in Similar Motion.” Other highlights include Mr. Reich’s “Sextet” and “Clapping Music.”

(7:30 p.m., Tuesday through Thursday, Howard Gilman Opera House, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene; 718-636-4100; bam.org.)
