Photo by Mike Weaver (Photo: Mike Weaver, Mike Weaver/Special to The Courier-Journal)Buy Photo\n\nMatt Bevin debuted his first ad of the general election on Friday, with a 30-second attack ad that likens Jack Conway's agenda to that of President Barack Obama.\n\nAppearing as if it's a NFL game promo, an announcer voices the entire commercial and claims Conway \"supports Obama's liberal agenda \u2013 that means he supports Obamacare and Obama's job-killing Cap and Trade Plan.\"\n\nIn 2009, while running for the Democratic nomination to the U.S. Senate, Conway said he supported cap and trade but only with a number of caveats \u2013 some of them unlikely.\n\nThe legislation would have capped the amount of pollutants businesses could release and allowed those that reduced emissions to sell their emission credits on the open market.\n\nConway said at the time that he opposed cap and time as it was originally filed, he said he liked some of the changes made by the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nThose changes included giving utilities additional credits and more time to meet goals, and spending $60 billion in federal money to fund research into technology that would capture carbon before it is released into the atmosphere \u2013 something that would have helped the coal industry \u2013 and another $20 billion to fund battery research.\n\nBut he said the bill needs to go further in providing tax credits to offset any increase in energy costs, providing strict government oversight of the trading of emissions credits. Additionally he said he would oppose it unless China, India and other countries to abide by the same provisions \u2013 an idea that China and India had rejected a week before.\n\nConway did say he would have voted \"proudly\" for the health care plan but said he would have preferred that the legislation allow Medicare to buy prescription drugs in bulk, which he says would save the country $200 billion.\n\nHere's the full script:\n\n\"Two teams taking the field. Leading Obama's team, political insider Jack Conway. Conway's playbook supports Obama's liberal agenda \u2013 that means Obamacare and Obama's job-killing Cap and Trade Plan. Conway will take us the wrong way.\n\n\"Leading Kentucky's team of greater prosperity is outsider businessman Matt Bevin. Bevin has a conservative game plan to cut taxes, create jobs and fight Obama's job-killing regulations.\n\n\"Vote the Kentucky Team. Matt Bevin for Governor.\"\n\nThe campaign said the ad is running in the Louisville, Lexington, Paducah, Evansville, Hazard and Charleston markets. The campaign didn't say how big the buy was but one document filed with the Federal Communication Commission estimates the total spent in Louisville to be about $70,000, which would signify a significant ad buy.\n\nBevin hasn't been raising much money and going up now suggests he has contributed or loaned a significant amount of his own money to his campaign.\n\nReporter Joseph Gerth can be reached at (502) 582-4702 or jgerth@courier-journal.com.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cjky.it/1KkXBXp", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Matt Bevin debuted his first ad of the general election on Friday, with a 30-second attack ad that likens Jack Conway's agenda to that of President Barack Obama.", "og": {"site_name": "The Courier-Journal", "description": "Matt Bevin debuted his first ad of the general election on Friday, with a 30-second attack ad that likens Jack Conway's agenda to that of President Barack Obama.", "title": "Bevin hits the air, and Conway, with first ad", "url": "http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/politics/elections/kentucky/2015/09/18/bevin-hits-air-and-conway-first-ad/72390446/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/courier-journal.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Matt Bevin debuted his first ad of the general election on Friday, with a 30-second attack ad that likens Jack Conway's agenda to that of President Barack Obama.", "title": "Matt Bevin hits the air and Jack Conway with first ad", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0a001c4ea7ef644090f4d68314af85cf9614c9f0/c=334-0-1665-1331&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/08/22/Louisville/Louisville/635758562136940666-ReligiousFreedomRally15.JPG", "creator": "@courierjournal", "site": "@courierjournal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600030236", "fb": {"app_id": 128534137209813}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Organizations/U.S. House of Representatives", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Organizations/U.S. House of Representatives", "title": "Bevin hits the air, and Conway, with first ad", "author": "Joseph Gerth", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/politics/elections/kentucky", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/45bea3551ea4a437599df47e0422def91bca4d8d/c=501-0-1499-1331/local/-/media/2015/08/22/Louisville/Louisville/635758562136940666-ReligiousFreedomRally15.JPG", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f823009548f82de666f6596c4af5908a98961cd0/c=334-0-1665-1331/local/-/media/2015/08/22/Louisville/Louisville/635758562136940666-ReligiousFreedomRally15.JPG", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/627255618c2cfc5dfc267fdda23771ec1573d160/c=115-0-1885-1331/local/-/media/2015/08/22/Louisville/Louisville/635758562136940666-ReligiousFreedomRally15.JPG", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/38daf8a89f591d2debfbb51e0783260c17c5169e/c=0-101-2000-1231&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/08/22/Louisville/Louisville/635758562136940666-ReligiousFreedomRally15.JPG", "publishtime": "2015-09-18T10:15:17.947000-04:00", "shorthed": "Bevin hits the air, and Conway, with first ad", "articleid": 72390446, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7a81bce59219e091336fdaea5f8ca089417f6a19/c=0-101-2000-1231/local/-/media/2015/08/22/Louisville/Louisville/635758562136940666-ReligiousFreedomRally15.JPG", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/af1b837135d505e50b461e14794d7b551bbff85a/c=627-0-1372-1331/local/-/media/2015/08/22/Louisville/Louisville/635758562136940666-ReligiousFreedomRally15.JPG"}}, "news_keywords": "Matt Bevin, Jack Conway, Kentucky, Kentucky governor, election 2016, Barack Obama,"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0bf2\"", "article_summary": "Conway's playbook supports Obama's liberal agenda \u2013 that means Obamacare and Obama's job-killing Cap and Trade Plan.\nLeading Obama's team, political insider Jack Conway.\nAppearing as if it's a NFL game promo, an announcer voices the entire commercial and claims Conway \"supports Obama's liberal agenda \u2013 that means he supports Obamacare and Obama's job-killing Cap and Trade Plan.\"\nBuy Photo Republican gubernatorial candidate, Matt Bevin, speaks at a Religious Freedom Rally in Frankfort, Ky., on Saturday, August 22, 2015.\nBevin has a conservative game plan to cut taxes, create jobs and fight Obama's job-killing regulations."}
