An engagement rate is the percentage of people who saw a post and liked it, shared it, clicked or commented on it.\n\nAnd the group\u2019s fundraising numbers have exploded in recent days, according to Beck. Small donations are on the rise, as they often are in times of high-profile immigration issues.\n\n\u201cBut we are really pulling in some bigger donations right now,\u201d Beck said. \u201cFolks are really paying attention to their tax deductions, giving the big money. They\u2019re saying there is an awful lot on the line.\n\n\u201cPeople are legitimately concerned about the whole state of our constitutional government,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not around the edges, this is right in the heart of America.\u201d\n\nThe president shrugged off the label of \u201camnesty,\u201d asserting in his speech Thursday night that amnesty is the broken U.S. immigration system in place, \u201cmillions of people who live here without paying their taxes or playing by the rules, while politicians use the issue to scare people and whip up votes at election time.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s amnesty, critics contend, when legal status is afforded to millions of illegal immigrants while so many millions who played by the rules spent so long in the pursuit of U.S. citizenship. Obama says his order will not provide a pathway to citizenship and does not open the door to federal benefits such as Obamacare.\n\nPolicy experts are arguing those points, with some saying the amnesty order could cost taxpayers untold billions of dollars in public assistance.\n\nAnd, there\u2019s a lot of outrage out there. Chuck Molyneaux, a member of the McKinney (Texas) Tea Party, said he has heard plenty of it in the past couple of days.\n\n\u201cThis is an extremely strong driving point in the conservative movement across the United States, particularly in the South,\u201d he said of the amnesty order. \u201cIt\u2019s huge. The ramifications of this are disastrous.\u201d\n\nMolyneaux said his organization has seen emails spike since Wednesday, when the president first announced his intentions to be a one-man immigration reformer.\n\nJames Neighbors, founder and president of Overpasses for America, a limited-government organization that originally formed as a movement to impeach Obama, said the activity level on the group\u2019s website, email communications and phone communications has \u201cskyrocketed\u201d since Wednesday.\n\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s increased across the board,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is something that is very important to the American people, and the overwhelming message I\u2019m getting is that there is no need for reform, there is need for enforcement. \u201c\n\nNeighbors said he was leaving Thursday night for Las Vegas, where a group of anti-amnesty movement members plans to protest Obama\u2019s order-signing ceremony Friday. The event is expected to be held at the Las Vegas high school where Obama rolled out his original immigration reform vision in 2012. His \u201cdeferred action\u201d plan retains many of the same features.\n\nBeck, of NumbersUSA, said he has seen spikes in engagement and contributions during past immigration battles in Congress, but this battle, he said, is different. There\u2019s much more at stake, and he believes many more will join the fight in the coming weeks.\n\n\u201cI think this is going to go on for some time,\u201d he said. \u201cSome people say we may be fighting this for the entire final two years of Obama\u2019s presidency.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Conservative groups see participation rise in wake of Obama amnesty plan", "title": "Conservative groups see spike in participation in wake of Obama amnesty plan - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/11/New-Obama.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-12-19T11:22:12+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/184172/conservative-amnesty-obama/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Immigration", "tag": "abuse of power,amnesty,Chuck Molyneaux,Immigration,James Neighbors,Las Vegas,NumbersUSA,Obama,ObamaCare,Overpasses for America,Politics & Elections 1,Roy Beck,Tea Party", "published_time": "2014-11-21T08:00:30+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-19T11:22:12+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Conservative groups see participation rise in wake of Obama amnesty plan", "title": "Conservative groups see spike in participation in wake of Obama amnesty plan - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/11/New-Obama.jpg"}, "creator": "@wiswatchdog", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "description": "Conservative groups see participation rise in wake of Obama amnesty plan"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc5bb\"", "article_summary": "Kittle | Watchdog.orgPresident Obama\u2019s amnesty plan may be costly to the U.S. economy, but it\u2019s big business for conservative grassroots groups fighting the unprecedented executive decree.\nPolicy experts are arguing those points, with some saying the amnesty order could cost taxpayers untold billions of dollars in public assistance.\n\u201cThis is an extremely strong driving point in the conservative movement across the United States, particularly in the South,\u201d he said of the amnesty order.\nObama says his order will not provide a pathway to citizenship and does not open the door to federal benefits such as Obamacare.\nThe event is expected to be held at the Las Vegas high school where Obama rolled out his original immigration reform vision in 2012."}
