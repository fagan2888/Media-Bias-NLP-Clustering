The average annual cost of insurance for a new Wrangler is $1,134.\n\nThe Jeep Patriot Sport 2WD took the second cheapest spot on the list ($1,136 per year), followed by the Honda CR-V LX 4WD ($1,160 per year). The Dodge Grand Caravan SE Plus and the Honda Odyssey LX rounded out the top spot with annual rates of $1,162 and $1,163 respectively.\n\nRelated: The Best Time to Buy Car Insurance\n\nCheaper insurance rates are generally associated with cars that are easier to repair than others or that have fewer claims, or both.\n\nThe analysis, however, also found that rates vary significantly by state. The same owner of that Jeep Wrangler would pay just $964 per year for insurance in Maine \u2013 but would have to shell out more than $2,000 in Michigan.\n\nThe most expensive 2015 car to insure is the Nissan GT-R Nismo, which costs an average of $3,574 per year.\n\nNo matter what car you drive, periodically shopping around for a new insurance policy is the best way to save money. Customers who shopped around when switching insurers in the past year saved an average of $300, according to a report issued last year by J.D. Power & Associates.\n\nRelated: The 6 Best Cars at the 2015 Detroit Auto Show\n\nYou may also be able to reduce your premiums by bundling your home and auto policy with the same insurer, increasing your deductible, or switching to a pay-as-you drive policy.\n\nSmart consumers certainly know to look beyond price when selecting auto insurance. \u201cWe try to educate consumers to also look at claims ratings, customer service ratings, and how financially stable the companies are,\u201d says Josh Drziabiak, cofounder of insurance comparison site TheZebra.com.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The Jeep Wrangler Sport 4WD is the cheapest 2015 vehicle to insure, according to a", "title": "This Is the Cheapest Car to Insure in 2015", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/19/Cheapest-Car-Insure-2015", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/08082013_Insurance_Claim_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/19/Cheapest-Car-Insure-2015", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/08082013_Insurance_Claim_article.jpg", "creator": "@bethbrav", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The Jeep Wrangler Sport 4WD is the cheapest 2015 vehicle to insure, according to a", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdec7\"", "article_summary": "The most expensive 2015 car to insure is the Nissan GT-R Nismo, which costs an average of $3,574 per year.\nThe Jeep Wrangler Sport 4WD is the cheapest 2015 vehicle to insure, according to a new analysis from Insure.com, a consumer insurance website.\nSmart consumers certainly know to look beyond price when selecting auto insurance.\nRelated: The Best Time to Buy Car InsuranceCheaper insurance rates are generally associated with cars that are easier to repair than others or that have fewer claims, or both.\nNo matter what car you drive, periodically shopping around for a new insurance policy is the best way to save money."}
