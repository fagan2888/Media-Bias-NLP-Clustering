The findings are among several new insights the Department of Health and Human Services published on Tuesday, compiled in the first federal study of sexual orientation and health practices that evaluates differences across groups. The report includes responses from nearly 35,000 adults aged 18 and up, revealing fascinating \u2014 and sometimes dispiriting \u2014 data about lesbian, gay, bisexual and heterosexual health practices.\n\nThe study relied on self-reported sexual orientation identification, asking participants if they considered themselves \u201clesbian or gay,\u201d \u201cstraight, that is, not gay\u201d or \u201cbisexual.\u201d Participants of both genders could also opt to identify as \u201csomething else\u201d or say \u201cI don\u2019t know the answer,\u201d but were asked an additional follow-up question that was not included in the report. Approximately 96.6 percent of participants identified as straight while just 1.6 percent identified as gay or lesbian and 0.7 percent identified as bisexual.\n\nThe data revealed some major disparities in the area of healthcare access, finding that bisexual people of both genders were significantly less likely to have health insurance than people of any other group. Nearly a quarter of bisexual respondents were uninsured, while approximately 84 percent of gay, lesbian and heterosexual respondents did have medical coverage. When it comes to seeking out certain medical treatment, specifically HIV testing, gay, lesbian and bisexual people were more likely than their straight counterparts to participate. Additionally, nearly half of gay and lesbian respondents reported getting flu vaccines, but bi- and heterosexual people lagged behind.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new HHS study breaks down key health trends by sexual orientation, revealing major differences across groups", "author": "Jenny Kutner", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "A new HHS study breaks down key health trends by sexual orientation, revealing major differences across groups", "title": "Lesbians are more likely to get vaccinated, but also to drink excessively", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/07/15/lesbians_are_more_likely_to_get_vaccinated_but_also_to_drink_excessively/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2010/06/im_24_im_an_alcoholic_and_im_not_alone.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A new HHS study breaks down key health trends by sexual orientation, revealing major differences across groups", "creator": "@@JennyKutner", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2010/06/im_24_im_an_alcoholic_and_im_not_alone.jpg", "title": "Lesbians are more likely to get vaccinated, but also to drink excessively", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Lesbians are more likely to get vaccinated, but also to drink excessively", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Bisexual, Department of Health and Human Services, Gay, gay culture, Health, healthcare, heterosexual, HHS, Lesbian, straight, study", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfed3\"", "article_summary": "Nearly a quarter of bisexual respondents were uninsured, while approximately 84 percent of gay, lesbian and heterosexual respondents did have medical coverage.\nThe report includes responses from nearly 35,000 adults aged 18 and up, revealing fascinating \u2014 and sometimes dispiriting \u2014 data about lesbian, gay, bisexual and heterosexual health practices.\nAdditionally, nearly half of gay and lesbian respondents reported getting flu vaccines, but bi- and heterosexual people lagged behind.\nWhen it comes to seeking out certain medical treatment, specifically HIV testing, gay, lesbian and bisexual people were more likely than their straight counterparts to participate.\nApproximately 96.6 percent of participants identified as straight while just 1.6 percent identified as gay or lesbian and 0.7 percent identified as bisexual."}
