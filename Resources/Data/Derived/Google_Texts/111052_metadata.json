Several celebrities participate in the public service announcement. (YouTube/It's On Us)\n\nWhen President Obama and Vice President Biden urged Americans on Friday to end sexual assaults on college campuses, the event included a standard feature for this White House: celebrities.\n\nIn a video, Cleveland Cavaliers forward Kevin Love, actors Jon Hamm and Connie Britton and other big names tell their fans to heed the president\u2019s call, suggesting that people need to take responsibility for preventing rape among U.S. college students.\n\nStars have become an integral part of the White House messaging operation, from urging Americans to eat healthier to decrying the wage gap between men and women. While presidents have hobnobbed with celebrities for decades \u2014 Ronald Reagan once brought Princess Diana and John Travolta together on a dance floor \u2014 Obama and his aides have taken such relationships to a new level, systematically working with Hollywood actors, professional athletes and music stars to help raise money and promote the administration\u2019s top domestic policy priorities.\n\nThe effort amounts to a separate publicity branch for the White House \u2014 at no extra charge. After several YouTube stars met with the president in late February to discuss the Affordable Care Act, they created 25 videos touting the law \u2014 garnering more than 32 million viewings.\n\nWhite House officials see such efforts as a way to reach key demographic groups, especially those who eschew traditional political media. The celebrity push is in part an outgrowth of the administration\u2019s campaign to enroll young people, African Americans, Latinos and women under Obama\u2019s health-care law.\n\nFunny or Die, the Emmy-award winning comedy website, has produced 11 short videos featuring a range of celebrities who work for free to plug President Obama's agenda. Here's a sample. (Jeff Simon/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cOur purpose here is to meet people where they are,\u201d White House senior adviser Valerie Jarrett said. \u201cWe\u2019re extremely strategic in how we engage and deploy validators, and we\u2019re very fortunate that people who have tremendous followings across the country are willing to be very effective messengers.\u201d\n\nRepublicans, for their part, said it shows how the president is out of touch with everyday Americans.\n\n\u201cFor years Obama and the Democrats have seemingly put more time and emphasis on celebrities than their policies and for years we\u2019ve questioned the value in that priority,\u201d said Republican National Committee spokeswoman Kirsten Kukowski, whose boss dubbed Obama the \u201cCelebrity-in-Chief\u201d during the 2012 campaign. \u201cWith 57 percent of the country disapproving of Obama and his policies, it\u2019s a good thing he has celebrities behind him.\u201d\n\nBut with Obama now well into his final term, his aides are less worried about whether bringing Hollywood types into his orbit could backfire politically.\n\nTommy Vietor, who served as the National Security Council spokesman during Obama\u2019s first term, said that \u201cif inviting George Clooney to the White House helps get press attention about Darfur, that\u2019s clearly worth it to the president, and he could care less about cynical political attacks.\u201d\n\nSome of these efforts might take time to pay off. The creators of \u201cFunny Or Die\u201d produced a video starring Kristen Bell \u2014 \u201cMary Poppins Quits,\u201d in favor of raising the minimum wage \u2014 that received nearly 3 million hits online, yet the issue remains moribund in Washington. And the president\u2019s approval ratings among 18- to 29-year-olds \u2014 the target audience for much for this Hollywood-tinged outreach \u2014 has dropped to 43 percent.\n\nRepublicans have criticized Obama for his Hollywood connections and his own celebrity status from the start of his presidential candidacy. His 2008 rival, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), ran an ad juxtaposing photos of Obama with Britney Spears and Paris Hilton, saying, \u201cHe\u2019s the biggest celebrity in the world. But can he lead?\u201d\n\nLast month, Alabama Republican Party chairman Bill Armistead wrote in an e-mail to supporters: \u201cSince 2009, the president has played more than 185 rounds of golf. Expensive vacation homes, fine dining, spontaneous trips, private concerts by the world\u2019s top music artists; Obama\u2019s life seems more like that of a celebrity than a president.\u201d\n\nBut Republicans are not immune to the lure of famous people. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) let Kevin Spacey shadow him to learn about whipping votes for the Netflix series \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d and he attended the series\u2019s second-season premiere. The party had Clint Eastwood give an unscripted speech at its 2012 convention, regularly features country music stars and NASCAR drivers at GOP events, and calls on famous coaches such as Lou Holtz for pep talks behind closed doors.\n\nTraditionally, presidents of both parties have enlisted celebrities at fundraisers and publicity events. Brookings Institution senior fellow emeritus Stephen Hess, who served under presidents Dwight Eisenhower and Richard M. Nixon, recalled how Ethel Merman helped raise money for Eisenhower (\u201cprobably because her husband was the president of an airline\u201d) and how Democrats such as the Kennedys \u201chad bushel baskets of starlets\u201d in their orbit.\n\nPresident Clinton appeared regularly with Hollywood stars, including Spacey, director Steven Spielberg and singer Barbra Streisand.\n\n\u201cFunny Or Die,\u201d a comedic Web site, illustrates the Obama administration\u2019s strategic approach to using celebrity supporters. The company\u2019s president of production, Mike Farah, said in a phone interview that the site\u2019s partnership with the administration began when he and others attended a White House meeting around the time of the 2013 White House Correspondents\u2019 Association dinner.\n\n\u201cIt just sounded like they needed a touch of help selling this dream,\u201d said Farah, whose firm produced 11 videos in cooperation with Obama aides in the past year and has another set to be released soon. Outside of campaigns, he said, \u201cgovernment, as it\u2019s set up, isn\u2019t really about selling things to the public.\u201d\n\nFarah declined to say how much his company spent producing the videos, saying it folds the expenses into its monthly budget and focuses on producing \u201cfunny, topical content that\u2019s relevant.\u201d He added he hopes some of the videos make viewers think about today\u2019s pressing political issues, but added, \u201cI don\u2019t have scientific evidence for this.\u201d\n\nAmong the most successful collaboration so far was an episode of \u201cBetween Two Ferns with Zach Galifianakis,\u201d a spoof talk show featuring an interview with Obama. The online video has been seen more than 24 million times and drove up traffic to the online federal health-care marketplace by 40 percent in a single day.\n\nSome of the White House\u2019s recruits have been surprised they made the list. Hannah Hart is a YouTube personality with 1.5 million subscribers who came to fame when a friend uploaded a video of her cooking while tipsy in her kitchen. When she got an e-mail inviting her to come to a meeting at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave., she recalled her response was, \u201cIs this real?\u201d\n\nHart has signed up for insurance on California\u2019s health-care exchange and hosted a livestream event on the topic. When she realized she would be sitting across from Obama in the Roosevelt Room, she said, \u201cbeads of sweat began to form along my brow.\u201d But she came away impressed with the exchange, posted a couple of videos, and said in an interview that she would be open to doing it again \u201con issues I feel strongly about.\u201d\n\nOn rare occasions, celebrity endorsers fumble their message. Pop singer Lance Bass visited the White House in the spring to discuss health care \u2014 and went on a rant after he tweeted an incorrect address for HealthCare.gov. \u201cGrow up people!\u201d he wrote in disgust.\n\nAnd of course many of these stars also help fill Democratic campaign coffers. In March 2013, Obama attended a Democratic National Committee reception at the New York City home of film studio executive Harvey Weinstein that also included stars such as Justin Timberlake and Steve Martin.\n\nIn July, he headlined a DNC fundraiser at the Los Angeles home of \u201cScandal\u201d creator Shonda Rhimes, which was co-hosted by the show\u2019s star, Kerry Washington.\n\nDNC spokeswoman Rebecca Chalif said in a statement that star-studded events offer \u201cways to connect with our supporters.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur well known supporters can be an invaluable asset to help us engage voters \u2014 especially voters who may not always turn out in midterms,\u201d Chalif wrote.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Celebrities have become an integral part of conveying messages to the masses for the White House.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/eilperin", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Celebrities have become an integral part of conveying messages to the masses for the White House.", "title": "Call to end sexual assault on campuses enlists star power", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/call-to-end-sexual-assault-on-campuses-enlists-star-power/2014/09/19/91ff1eb2-3e8d-11e4-b0ea-8141703bbf6f_story.html", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=https://img.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-3000x1568.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@eilperin"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/call-to-end-sexual-assault-on-campuses-enlists-star-power/2014/09/19/91ff1eb2-3e8d-11e4-b0ea-8141703bbf6f_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Obama, Obama celebrities, Kevin Love, Kevin Love Cavaliers, Affordable Care Act, Obamacare, Valerie Jarrett, Tommy Vietor, Bill Armistead Obama, Lou Holtz Obama, Beyonce Jay-Z, Beyonce Obama, George Clooney, George Clooney Obama, Kevin McCarthy, Kevin Spacey Kevin McCarthy, Clint Eastwood Republican, Clint Eastwood Republican convention, Funny or Die, Funny or Die White House, Zach Galifianakis, Hannah Hart", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/eilperin"}, "eomportal-uuid": "91ff1eb2-3e8d-11e4-b0ea-8141703bbf6f", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Obama, Obama celebrities, Kevin Love, Kevin Love Cavaliers, Affordable Care Act, Obamacare, Valerie Jarrett, Tommy Vietor, Bill Armistead Obama, Lou Holtz Obama, Beyonce Jay-Z, Beyonce Obama, George Clooney, George Clooney Obama, Kevin McCarthy, Kevin Spacey Kevin McCarthy, Clint Eastwood Republican, Clint Eastwood Republican convention, Funny or Die, Funny or Die White House, Zach Galifianakis, Hannah Hart"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2a30\"", "article_summary": "(YouTube/It's On Us)The White House launched the \"It's On Us\" campaign Friday, aimed at ending sexual assaults on college campuses.\n(YouTube/It's On Us)When President Obama and Vice President Biden urged Americans on Friday to end sexual assaults on college campuses, the event included a standard feature for this White House: celebrities.\nThe White House launched the \"It's On Us\" campaign Friday, aimed at ending sexual assaults on college campuses.\nWhite House officials see such efforts as a way to reach key demographic groups, especially those who eschew traditional political media.\n(Jeff Simon/The Washington Post)\u201cOur purpose here is to meet people where they are,\u201d White House senior adviser Valerie Jarrett said."}
