Walgreens redesigned its pharmacy area and modified its work flow to accommodate the change.\n\n\u201cPharmacy is still our core business,\u201d store manager Marty Young said.\n\nThe need for access to basic primary care has surged in the wake of the Affordable Care Act, said Jack Beaudoin, Walgreens marketing manager for the southwest Chicago region.\n\nWalgreens fills a niche for patients who don\u2019t have access to health care, offering minor episodic services for cold and flu patients, as well as treatment for chronic problems such as diabetes and hypertension, Beaudoin said.\n\nThe drug store\u2019s clinic offers walk-in convenience and charges less than an urgent care center, Beaudoin noted. Prices are about the same patients would expect to pay at a primary care center. A sports physical, for example, runs $60, and a mumps/measles/rubella vaccination costs $99. Most insurance plans are accepted.\n\n\u201cObviously, it\u2019s a lot more economical to come here than to be seen at an emergency room for a head cold,\u201d Beaudoin said.\n\nThe clinics are staffed by family nurse practitioners.\n\nThe company plans to unveil its renovated store on Cass Street on Thursday. Walgreens has 33 stores in the Joliet region, Benton said, and all eventually will be given the pharmacy and exam room upgrades.\n\nOther companies are taking advantage of the increase in business under the Affordable Care Act, as well.\n\nPhysicians Immediate Care opened a new 3,500-square-foot urgent care facility at Black Road and Larkin Avenue in July. The center offers X-rays, lab tests, treatment of injuries that aren\u2019t life-threatening and minor surgical procedures.\n\nCVS, Walgreens main competitor, began offering in-store clinics in 2000 on a limited basis. The service proved so popular it was expanded nationally. Walgreens followed in 2006.", "article_metadata": {"copyright": "2016 The Herald-News", "og": {"url": "http://www.theherald-news.com/2014/09/22/walgreens-shows-new-format-at-joliet-store/awtcwcp/", "image": "http://www.theherald-news.com/_internal/cimg!0/4e9glz5sypd3w3bymmucxvhwsg6r7xz", "site_name": "The Herald-News", "description": "JOLIET \u2013 Walgreens unveiled its new \u201cwell experience\u201d format Monday, featuring better pharmacist access and a private health room where patients can receive immunizations and consultations.", "title": "Walgreens shows new format at Joliet store"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Joliet_HN", "image": "http://www.theherald-news.com/_internal/cimg!0/4e9glz5sypd3w3bymmucxvhwsg6r7xz", "description": "JOLIET \u2013 Walgreens unveiled its new \u201cwell experience\u201d format Monday, featuring better pharmacist access and a private health room where patients can receive immunizations and consultations.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Walgreens shows new format at Joliet store"}, "robots": "All", "revisit-after": "1 Days", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1092756832", "fb": {"pages": 255829231119332}, "tout": {"article": {"id": "9d590be6-252b-453b-8b2e-2468bbd76fa8"}}, "keywords": "#JolietBusiness, walgreens", "distribution": "Global", "viewport": "width=device-width, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "JOLIET \u2013 Walgreens unveiled its new \u201cwell experience\u201d format Monday, featuring better pharmacist access and a private health room where patients can receive immunizations and consultations.\n\u201cPharmacy is still our core business,\u201d store manager Marty Young said.\nDarren Benton, regional manager for Walgreens Company, said the company is positioning itself as a \u201cconvenience store for health care.\u201d\u201cWe wanted to make it more of a health care environment,\u201d Benton said.\nWalgreens has 33 stores in the Joliet region, Benton said, and all eventually will be given the pharmacy and exam room upgrades.\nThe need for access to basic primary care has surged in the wake of the Affordable Care Act, said Jack Beaudoin, Walgreens marketing manager for the southwest Chicago region."}
