The IT strategy was a disaster. MNsure needs to change \u2014 and I should know. I\u2019m a MNsure board member. What\u2019s the definition of madness? We\u2019ve spent $140 million. We\u2019re about to spend $89 million more. To show for it, we have a mediocre MNsure website and an IT mess at the Department of Human Services (DHS). Plowing millions more down the same path? Let\u2019s talk about that.\n\nSen. Tony Lourey, DFL-Kerrick, has a bill that would do away with the MNsure board and make MNsure a state agency. I would argue that\u2019s where the problem began.\n\nThe vision for MNsure was the Legislature\u2019s \u2014 and it was grand.\n\nMNsure would not only serve the function of an exchange under the federal Affordable Care Act \u2014 determining eligibility for premium subsidies and helping Minnesotans shop for health plans \u2014 but it would also replace and integrate the antiquated DHS computer system in one grand new IT marvel.\n\nImportantly, it would be paid for almost entirely with federal money \u2014 and that was the beauty of it. Such was the Legislature\u2019s vision.\n\nThe strategy for implementing that vision came when MNsure was operating as a state agency. Before MNsure legislation was even passed, the commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Commerce, in 2011, contracted with four firms to customize and combine four different off-the-shelf software platforms to replace the DHS computer system and build the new exchange. It was to be a symphony of information technology, a wonder to behold.\n\nMNSURE logo\n\nBut the IT tasks were more difficult than agency staff members envisioned. Progress was slow. The technology outline on which MNsure was to be based came months too late from the federal government, just as the strategy of four different vendors building disconnected pieces of software was dissolving predictably into a full-blown IT disaster.\n\nIt gets worse. In February 2013, still acting entirely as a state agency, MNsure ousted its general contractor, deciding with hubris that its staff could better lead the project. MNsure the state agency had set the fateful course to manage one of the largest and most complex IT projects in state history \u2014 by itself.\n\nAnd the seven-member MNsure board? We\u2019d not yet been named and wouldn\u2019t be for months.\n\nThe rest of the story is painfully well-known. Deadlines passed. Software went untested. And when MNsure opened for business on Oct. 1, 2013, it went badly. Key aspects of the software didn\u2019t work. An understaffed call center was overwhelmed. Minnesotans sat on hold.\n\nWe\u2019ve been digging out ever since \u2014 with the board holding MNsure firmly by the lapels. Of course, hundreds of thousands of Minnesotans have also been subsequently insured.\n\nBut now the Legislature is in session \u2014 and a scapegoat is required. Frankly, no one involved should even offer a defense.\n\nEliminate the board? Go ahead. But let\u2019s be honest. That flawed vision? That was the Legislature\u2019s. That disastrous IT strategy? That came in the two-plus years when MNsure was acting as a state agency, as the legislative auditor\u2019s report lays bare.\n\nThat\u2019s the past. It\u2019s not a solution. What\u2019s needed is a change:\n\nLet\u2019s admit that MNsure and the DHS need a divorce. Papering over massive IT needs at DHS and calling it MNsure isn\u2019t accurate. It never was. The DHS computer system is not MNsure \u2014 and it shouldn\u2019t be. Federal funding or no, that legislative vision of one massive IT system doing all things for all people was a terrible IT blueprint.\n\nYou want to fix things? You want clarity and accountability? Have the DHS build and run its own IT system. Have MNsure run the exchange.\n\nShare what we should. One front door, one call-center number \u2014 we should agree to live together for the sake of our fellow Minnesotans. Let\u2019s share the front-end website. Let\u2019s share communications and outreach. These shared efforts have successfully reduced the number of uninsured Minnesotans to among the lowest in the nation. But let\u2019s separate and clarify what each of us is accountable for doing thereafter. DHS should operate the public programs. MNsure should help Minnesotans compare and buy insurance.\n\nWe need to live our separate lives. MNsure needs to date someone other than DHS. There are many successful exchanges. There are private-sector solutions that do comparative shopping better. Going our separate ways could be cheaper for both of us. And the DHS will be fine. Remember, we have $89 million to get us both on our feet. We should be able to make do.\n\nBut let\u2019s be honest. This isn\u2019t working. The vision was flawed. The strategy was terrible. It\u2019s time for change.\n\nEliminate the board if you like. But what\u2019s needed is a shift in strategy \u2014 not another state agency.\n\nThat\u2019s the kind of thinking that got us into this mess.\n\nTom Forsythe is vice president of global communications for General Mills and a member of the MNsure Board of Directors.
