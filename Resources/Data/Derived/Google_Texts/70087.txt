The mall in Hays will be closed for at least two days after heavy rain overnight Saturday into Sunday damaged the building.

Barricades block off the Big Creek Crossing property at 2918 Vine Street as property management waits for structural engineers to inspect the damage.

Rain water on the roof caused a partial collapse over the Payless shoe store, said Hays Deputy Fire Chief Ryan Hagans. Water had also made its way into the common hall areas.

Property Manager Katie Dorzweiler said Sunday morning the property will be closed for at least the next 48 hours.

KAKE viewer Kade Schmidt shared pictures from the mall and said crews were using bucket trucks and other equipment on site.

No injuries have been reported.

Dorzweiler said she appreciates the support from the community and their patience as they work to assess the damage.
