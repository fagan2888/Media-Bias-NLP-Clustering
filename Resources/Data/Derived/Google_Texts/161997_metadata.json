Bobby Jindal is hoping to tap into a conservative voter base and woo enough voters here over the next five months to have a big showing in the nation\u2019s first caucus early next year.\n\nThe plan isn\u2019t unique but, at the same time, is not entirely impossible.\n\nSeveral attendees at Jindal events across western Iowa this week said they had not previously seen Jindal in person, but nearly all said they were at least impressed by him and had not ruled him out. As he gave his stump speech and then fielded their questions, attendees were generally engaged \u2014 frequently applauding Jindal\u2019s positions.\n\n\u201cI think he has some great ideas and insight,\u201d said Micki O\u2019Neill, a Council Bluffs resident who was among those who had not previously seen Jindal in person.\n\nJindal has made it a point to be the last person out of the room as he makes stops in each of Iowa\u2019s 99 counties. In Council Bluffs on Tuesday, he stayed for more than an hour talking to people one-on-one, signing books and posters, and taking photos with attendees.\n\nChris Larimer, a political science professor at the University of Northern Iowa, said that type of retail politics goes a long way in Iowa because that\u2019s what Republicans who will participate in the Feb. 1 caucus expect.\n\n\u201cGenerally, the expectation is these candidates need to be out there, and they can take nothing for granted,\u201d he said. \u201c(Caucus-goers) expect access, and they want to ask \u2018Who are you? What are you about?\u2019 \u201d\n\nLarimer has dubbed the phenomenon the \u201cBig Wide-Mouthed Frog Theory,\u201d after a popular children\u2019s book in which a petite frog approaches larger animals to pepper them with questions about who they are and what they eat.\n\nWhile some Louisiana residents may scoff at Jindal\u2019s prospects, voters in Iowa generally don\u2019t appear to be as familiar with, nor as concerned with, criticism he has faced back home.\n\nJindal hasn\u2019t cracked out of the single digits in Iowa polls, but recent polls suggest he has high marks for favorability and has a relatively low unfavorable score in Iowa.\n\nA sampling of voters at this week\u2019s events said they had been at least somewhat familiar with Jindal\u2019s name but were not aware of nor concerned by his low approval rating in Louisiana.\n\nFor residents of Iowa, a simple trip to the diner right now could mean bumping into one of the 17 candidates running for president, and evening events featuring candidates come frequently.\n\nTime and again, attendees at Jindal\u2019s events this week have repeated that they like him but it\u2019s too early to decide who they will support. That leaves a large segment that could fall in Jindal\u2019s favor as the caucuses approach.\n\nLarimer said it\u2019s not impossible, though the crowded Republican field, which includes several candidates aiming for the same base of support, makes it more difficult this time around.\n\nJindal, for his part, is hoping to be the candidate who has enough face time and puts in enough hours to ensure he gets enough support.\n\n\u201cWe always campaign like this,\u201d Jindal said after one event this week. \u201cIt\u2019s different for voters when they can look the candidate in the face.\u201d\n\nLarimer said caucusgoers take the job of having the first say in the nominating process seriously and have a reputation for thoroughly vetting candidates before deciding who to back.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re pretty deliberate in their decisions in who to caucus for,\u201d he said.\n\nThat makes the outcome still pretty difficult to predict.\n\nIn the 2008 election, for example, eventual winner Mike Huckabee saw a surge of support in the final two months heading into the caucuses. Prior to that, Huckabee, who also sought out an evangelical Christian base of support, had polled low and was relatively unknown.\n\nJindal returns to speak at the Iowa State Fair on Saturday and has several more events scheduled over the next two weeks.\n\nAs he treks across Iowa, familiar questions pop up about immigration, abortion, terrorism, the federal Affordable Care Act and education \u2014 all topics that Jindal speaks about with ease and from a far-right position.\n\nAl Gates, an Iowa native who is retired and lives in Le Mars, said the 17-person Republican slate has him still weighing his options. But he was impressed by Jindal and the ease with which he talks about issues that are on conservative voters\u2019 minds.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not canned,\u201d he said after seeing Jindal for the first time in person.\n\nAlex Wimmer, a high school history teacher, said he also hopes to see all of the candidates and talk to them. He took a photo with Jindal earlier this week after attending his first Jindal event.\n\n\u201cI like a lot of the things he said,\u201d Wimmer said.\n\nMichelle Connor, an occupational therapist, said she also had not made up her mind who to support but she was \u201cvery encouraged\u201d by Jindal.\n\n\u201cHe knows what he wants and what he stands for,\u201d she said.\n\nOne of Connor\u2019s patients, meanwhile, has already decided to back Jindal, she said. Because he wasn\u2019t able to make it to Jindal\u2019s appearances this week, Connor snagged for him a glossy, blue \u201cJindal for President\u201d sign that had been taped to the banquet room\u2019s wall.\n\n\u201cHe will love it!\u201d she exclaimed.\n\nFollow Elizabeth Crisp on Twitter, @elizabethcrisp.
