a nacelles plant in Brighton; and a tower factory in Pueblo.\n\nThe company has announced it will add hundreds of additional jobs but has not given a precise number.\n\n\u201cThe PTC will have continued benefits for wind-industry activity in 2014 even though the credit will expire,\u201d said Sarah Cottrell Propst, executive director of the trade group Interwest Energy Alliance.\n\n\u201cThe industry will continue to encourage Congress to take up comprehensive tax reform as quickly as possible to address the wind PTC,\u201d Propst said.\n\nMark Jaffe: 303-954-1912, mjaffe@denverpost.com or twitter.com/bymarkjaffe\n\n9\n\nNumber of orders of 1,700 megawatts of turbine received by Vestas Wind Systems\n\n40%\n\nHow much the workforce in Colorado was cut in 2012 when a federal tax cut expired", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Near-record orders spur Vestas wind-turbine production and hiring", "title": "Near-record orders spur Vestas wind-turbine production and hiring", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/12/26/near-record-orders-spur-vestas-wind-turbine-production-and-hiring/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131226__20131227_A14_BZ26VESTASp1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131226__20131227_A14_BZ26VESTASp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-26T13:40:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-29T07:54:04+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcea9b\"", "article_summary": "After a year in which Vestas Wind Systems slashed its Colorado workforce, wind-turbine orders reached near-record numbers in 2013 and hiring is on the rise.\n\u201cWe have a longer runway because of the interpretation of what it means to start a project,\u201d Brown said.\nThe orders Vestas has will stretch into 2015 and perhaps into 2016, Brown said.\nSo while Vestas has orders for 1,700 megawatts, three of those on master supply agreements could add up to another 1,900 megawatts.\n\u201cThe industry will continue to encourage Congress to take up comprehensive tax reform as quickly as possible to address the wind PTC,\u201d Propst said."}
