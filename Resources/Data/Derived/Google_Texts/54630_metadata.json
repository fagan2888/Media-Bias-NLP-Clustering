First there were the questions about his birth certificate. Birthers, unaware that Hawaii joined the union in 1959, were in the streets asking to see the certificate like a disgruntled man on the Maury Show.\n\nThen, during an address to a joint session of Congress in 2009, Representative Joe Wilson (R-S.C.) shouted \u2018You Lie!\u2019 as President Obama tried to explain the details of the Affordable Care Act. Wilson was later unapologetic and used his heckling as an opportunity to raise money for reelection.\n\nWhen he travelled to Arizona in 2012, Governor Jen Brewer pointed a finger in Obama\u2019s face as soon as he arrived at Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport. The only thing she didn\u2019t do was refer to him as \u2018boy.\u2019 Gov. Brewer treated Obama like a ni**er without having to say it.\n\nWhen he visited Oklahoma in 2015, not long after the massacre of 9 black men and women in Mother Emmanuel AME Church by a Confederate Flag waving racist, he was met by a few good ol\u2019 boys waving the Stars and Bars.\n\nBut, of course, it was all about states\u2019 rights.\n\nI could go on. There is the heckling by a reporter from the Daily Caller in the Rose Garden. The chair lecture he received at the hands of Bill O\u2019Reilly. The former Mayor of New York City saying of Obama, \u201cI do not believe, and I know this is a horrible thing to say, but I do not believe that the president loves America\u2026He doesn\u2019t love you. And he doesn\u2019t love me. He wasn\u2019t brought up the way you were brought up and I was brought up through love of this country.\u201d\n\nThe list is seemingly endless, but as we reach the end of his presidency, Senate Republicans are setting precedent with the level of disrespect they\u2019re directing at President Obama.\n\nNow members of the all Republican Senate Judiciary Committee said they would neither hold confirmation hearings nor vote on the person President Obama nominates to replace Justice Antonin Scalia.\n\nIt is a matter of professional courtesy for Senators on the Judiciary Committee to meet with nominees named by the president, but, when asked if he would adhere to that historical precedent, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said he would not. \u201cI don\u2019t know the purpose of such a visit. I would not be inclined to take that myself.\u201d When asked the same, Senator John Cornyn of Texas agreed. \u201cI don\u2019t see the point of going through the motions if we know what the outcome is going to be.\u201d\n\nMany on social media have voiced sadness about the fact that Obama will soon leave the presidency. While I understand the symbolic power of black folks in general, and black kids in particular, seeing a family in the White House that looks like them, I\u2019m ready to see this president\u2019s final year in office come to an end.\n\nWhen Obama was elected, many thought we were being ushered into a new era\u2014certainly not a post-racial milieu, but, perhaps, a less overt one. The fact that a black man could rise so high was shocking. It made many think that things were getting better. It gave us hope. Now, that hope is gone.\n\nIt is clear that no matter how high you rise, no matter what office you hold, no matter how hard you work, if you are black, many will view and treat you like a second-class citizen. No, they won\u2019t use racial epithets. They will not burn a cross in your yard. They may not spit in your face. But the undeniable fact is that white supremacy is here to stay, and no election will cure that ill.\n\nI\u2019m ready for Obama to leave office. I don\u2019t care how many times he says pop-off. I don\u2019t care how often he daps up Kevin Durant. I\u2019m not swayed by the number of black women from the civil rights generation that dance in the White House when they meet him.\n\nI\u2019m tired of seeing President Obama blatantly disrespected, and my soul is weary from having to see him grin and bear it. I\u2019m ready for President Obama to be free from the burden of having to perform for white supremacy\u2014and I\u2019m ready to be free from the burden of having to watch him do it.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "www.counterpunch.org", "description": "Barack Obama must be the most disrespected president in American history.
