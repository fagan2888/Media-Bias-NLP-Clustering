Our electoral success obliges a higher degree of responsibility when selecting candidates.\n\nAn ideal candidate has proven conservative credentials and an awareness of governing, and enjoys widespread public support.\n\nWith this responsibility in mind, our party endorsed Wayne Stenehjem for governor and Nicole Poolman for lieutenant governor.\n\nStenehjem is a tested leader who has effectively served the citizens of our state. As attorney general, Stenehjem has fought against Obamacare and federal overreach at every turn. He has an encyclopedic knowledge of North Dakota and its people. His relationships with other leaders inside and outside of government will produce a broad coalition of support that will be ready to govern on Day One.\n\nPoolman is a mother and teacher as well as a dynamic leader in our Legislature. She has been an advocate for children and families and a guardian of sound fiscal policies. She represents the positive, conservative future of our state.\n\nThe Stenehjem-Poolman ticket offers a record of conservative values and integrity that has won endorsements from across the political spectrum. That's why an overwhelming majority of our state's elected officials have voiced unequivocal support for the candidates and why so many from outside our party support their election.\n\nWe urge those inside and outside our party to support Stenehjem for governor and Poolman for lieutenant governor in the Republican primary election.\n\nKelly Armstrong\n\nStan Stein\n\nKen Karls\n\nDan Traynor\n\nCurly Haugland\n\nLayton Freborg\n\nBismarck\n\nArmstrong is chairman of the North Dakota Republican Party. Stein, Karls, Traynor, Haugland and Freborg are former chairmen of the party.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "opinion,letters,Wayne Stenehjem,nicole poolman,North Dakota governors race,2016 elections", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Grand Forks Herald", "description": "As current and former chairs of the Republican Party, we know the special responsibility that comes with selecting our party's nominees.
