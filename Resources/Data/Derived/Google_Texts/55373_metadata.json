To reach it, though, diplomacy will have to settle very old scores.\n\nAfter Fidel Castro seized power in 1959, Cuba confiscated property belonging to thousands of American citizens and companies. Edmund and Enna Chester lost an 80-acre farm, thousands of dollars\u2019 worth of stock and a Buick that, who knows, might still be plying Havana\u2019s streets.\n\nIn 1996, Congress passed a law insisting Cuba pay for confiscated property, valued today at $7 billion, before lifting the U.S. embargo.\n\nThat went unmentioned in President Barack Obama\u2019s announcement in December that the countries would resume diplomatic ties. Given Cuba\u2019s frail economy, experts say companies whose property was taken might settle for rights to do business there and move on.\n\nBut corporations don\u2019t cling to memories like families can. That\u2019s clear inside Chester\u2019s 832-square-foot bungalow, where her mother\u2019s gold-framed portrait watches over the yellowing property deed and worthless stock certificates.\n\nThe federal Foreign Claims Settlement Commission has fielded thousands of claims for confiscated Cuban property. The largest came from corporations, led by U.S.-owned Cuban Electric Co., for power plants valued at $268 million. Most came from individuals and families.\n\nExperts differ on what to make of the American claims, protected by international law.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re now dealing in the realm of memory more than anything else,\u201d says Robert Muse, an attorney representing companies with claims.\n\nBut Mauricio Tamargo, commission chairman until 2010 and now a Washington lawyer representing claimants, said confiscations inflicted lasting damage on families. \u201cMany of them never recovered financially,\u201d Tamargo says.\n\nEdmund Chester\u2019s story began when he returned to Louisville, Ky., from the Army and found work as a newspaper reporter. He taught himself Spanish, and in 1929 he was hired by The Associated Press, which dispatched him to Havana.\n\nChester spent a decade reporting from the Caribbean and Latin America, time that seeded two crucial relationships.\n\nThe first came after covering a 1933 revolt that put a former sergeant, Fulgencio Batista, in charge of Cuba\u2019s military. In the 1950s, when Batista was Cuba\u2019s dictator, he trusted Chester \u2014 by then a confidant and no longer a journalist \u2014 to write his biography.\n\nThe second began when Chester covered a 1939 earthquake in Chile and spotted Enna at a hotel swimming pool.\n\nIn 1940, CBS hired Chester as chief of radio broadcasting for Latin America. Eventually, he became the network\u2019s director of news in New York.\n\nHe opened a public-relations agency in Cuba and bought an 80-acre farm there. In 1957, the Chesters acquired $250,000 worth of Cuban Telephone Co shares. But Edmund Chester, then Batista\u2019s speechwriter, grew uneasy as Castro gained ground.\n\nHe rejoined the family in Florida before Christmas. Batista fled days later, and Castro seized control. Marooned, Edmund Chester wrote that his nest egg had been \u201cwhipped into a batch of Cuban scrambled eggs by the tyranny of Fidel Castro.\u201d\n\n5,900\n\nAmerican claims for confiscated property that were certified by the federal Foreign Claims Settlement Commission. Though originally valued at nearly $1.9 billion, adjustments for inflation mean they are worth $7 billion or more today.\n\n$268 million\n\nOne of the largest claims, by American-owned Cuban Electric Co. for lost power plants, a claim now held by retailer Office Depot Inc. as a result of mergers\n\n8 in 10\n\nNumber of claims for lost property valued at $10,000 or less by the FCSC.\n\n70 percent\n\nClaims that were for stock.
