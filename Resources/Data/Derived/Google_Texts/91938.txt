On her Tuesday radio show, conservative talk show host Laura Ingraham warned Republicans seeking to prevent current ranking Republican on the Senate Budget Committee, Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL), from taking the chairman’s gavel next year when Republicans take over the U.S. Senate.

Some Republicans are said to be pushing for Sen. Mike Enzi (R-WY), who is unacceptable as a candidate according to Ingraham because he voted for the CR/omnibus.

“I have a housekeeping note here that we all have to keep to the forefront of our minds as we close out our political season this year,” Ingraham said. “The establishment and other crony friends are trying to force Jeff Sessions out as chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, an extremely important position. They’re trying to replace him with Mike Ezni. Remember, Liz Cheney tried to replace him. It didn’t work out. So Enzi voted for the CR/omnibus. Sessions said, ‘No way. Of course I can’t vote for the CR/omnibus.’ Sessions is the man. Support Jeff Sessions. And all you Republicans trying to force him out – we’re keeping a list.”
