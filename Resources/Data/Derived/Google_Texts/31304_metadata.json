And big companies already have the information technology that helps them keep track of all the information they need for their employees.\n\nFor companies using a software system such as SAP or relying on ADP for payroll help, how hard could it possibly be to fill out some tax documents for employees? Five clicks of the mouse? Ten?\n\nBut as it turns out, the data required to comply with the Affordable Care Act is harder to assemble. In fact, the Health E(fx) founders knew that no number of mouse clicks would \u00adeasily compile it from the information \u00adsystems most employers have.\n\n\u201cA lot of the folks thought it was going to be a lot easier than it is,\u201d said Andy Brown, co-founder and CEO of Health E(fx).\n\nThe leaders of the company come from two different professional backgrounds. Some, including Brown, came from Wardrop, a global company based in Canada that was most often described as an engineering consulting firm, serving big complex industries like nuclear power and oil exploration.\n\nBrown and a partner took some of their share of the proceeds from its 2009 sale and funded the start up of Health E(fx). From their experience working on big compliance challenges for Wardrop clients, they knew how to attack the technical problems of \u00adcomplying with the ACA.\n\nAnother co-founder, \u00adAllison Manno, is representative of the other side of the company. She knew how much pain employers would soon be in, having been director of benefits and payroll for Regis Corp. It would be particularly bad for employers with big flexible work forces like hair salon chains or retailers.\n\nCongress did give companies a few years to figure out how to comply with the ACA. The rules here are those that apply to employers called ALEs \u2014 not a refreshing cold beer but Applicable Large Employers \u2014 the ones now hustling to get ready for a looming deadline.\n\nGenerally employers with 50 or more employees have to show that they actually offer health insurance coverage to full-time employees and their dependents. There also are rules about how much that coverage should cost a family.\n\nFurther, those employers must send statements to all employees eligible for health insurance coverage. All this has to happen on time or the employer faces the potential for costly fines and penalties, and the law made enforcement the problem of the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nThat\u2019s how employers got the task of completing and mailing the form 1095-C, with a copy to the IRS. And as one consultant put it, \u201conce any company has to start reporting to the IRS, the stress level triples.\u201d\n\nIt doesn\u2019t look like a particularly complicated form, but the real challenge comes from pulling information from more than one system. Some is basic information in the human resources files. Some of the rest of the data that\u2019s needed comes from the \u00adsystem that keeps track of health \u00adbenefits. Other data is going to be needed from the payroll system.\n\nEmployees who have left the company might elect to keep getting health insurance under COBRA, and management of that has most likely been turned over to some outside firm. Brown said even big organizations seem to track family or medical leaves on a simple spreadsheet.\n\nA survey from April by PricewaterhouseCoopers and Equifax found that just one in 10 big employers had figured out how to comply. Nearly two-thirds admitted being worried about sending employees and the IRS inaccurate data, given their multiple information systems. And more than 15 percent of them admitted to being clueless, having not thought about it or not knowing where to even start.\n\nThe first form 1095-Cs are due in just over six months.\n\nHealth E(fx) is not the only firm to figure employers have a problem, of course, but it does seem to have been early to a solution. Health E(fx) had a big customer by the end of 2013, the Arby\u2019s Restaurant Group. Robert Norton of Arby\u2019s said he found Health E(fx) through a benefits broker, because he was already looking a couple of years ago for solutions to a problem he knew would come soon enough.\n\nThis year, Health E(fx) produced about 30,000 form 1095-Cs for Arby\u2019s. The IRS didn\u2019t want them mailed to employees, Norton said, but about two dozen people called the Arby\u2019s benefits office, having heard from their tax adviser that they would need proof of health insurance. And Norton was able to e-mail what the document would look like \u2014 with accurate 2014 information.\n\nAs for the rest of the industry serving employers, \u201cthey are getting there, but it\u2019s going to be messy,\u201d said Bob Radecki, founder and CEO of a St. Paul-based benefits compliance consulting firm. \u201cIt\u2019s raining vendors. I\u2019m up to 60 on my list, and I am just getting started. A couple of them asked for our help with their compliance module. It\u2019s July! This is all due in January!\u201d\n\nThere is a lot more the Health E(fx) product can do than just help comply with the law, Brown said, such as providing information on the effectiveness and costs of health benefits. As for now, though, Health E(fx) is busy with customers facing a deadline, and is already up to about 3.5 million employees on the system.\n\nThe company itself has more than 50 employees, but so far none of them are traditional salespeople. As Brown dryly observed, \u201cwe knew the solution would sell itself.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "Tucked away in a Minnetonka office park is a new software company called Health E(fx) that looks like it&rsquo;s on its way to being a big success, another reminder that our vibrant market economy really does come up with solutions to vexing problems.", "title": "Entrepreneurs saw opportunity in health law requirements", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/entrepreneurs-saw-opportunity-in-health-law-requirements/316058861/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/schafercolumn71715.JPG?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/schafercolumn71715.JPG?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "twitter": {"description": "Tucked away in a Minnetonka office park is a new software company called Health E(fx) that looks like it&rsquo;s on its way to being a big success, another reminder that our vibrant market economy really does come up with solutions to vexing problems.", "title": "Entrepreneurs saw opportunity in health law requirements", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/entrepreneurs-saw-opportunity-in-health-law-requirements/316058861/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/schafercolumn71715.JPG?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/schafercolumn71715.JPG?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "description": "Tucked away in a Minnetonka office park is a new software company called Health E(fx) that looks like it&rsquo;s on its way to being a big success, another reminder that our vibrant market economy really does come up with solutions to vexing problems."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb9c4\"", "article_summary": "What\u2019s remarkable in this case is that Health E(fx) is the kind of \u00adbusiness that common sense suggests probably shouldn\u2019t exist at all.\nSome of the rest of the data that\u2019s needed comes from the \u00adsystem that keeps track of health \u00adbenefits.\nBrown and a partner took some of their share of the proceeds from its 2009 sale and funded the start up of Health E(fx).\n\u201cA lot of the folks thought it was going to be a lot easier than it is,\u201d said Andy Brown, co-founder and CEO of Health E(fx).\nA survey from April by PricewaterhouseCoopers and Equifax found that just one in 10 big employers had figured out how to comply."}
