In the latest case, they argued that the law violated the constitutional requirement that revenue-raising legislation start in the House before proceeding to the Senate.\n\nIn declining to hear that contention, the high court all but ensured that the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, will remain intact through the November election. The rebuff leaves health care as one of the core issues in the presidential and congressional campaigns.\n\nThe latest challenge was pressed by the Pacific Legal Foundation, an advocacy group based in Sacramento, California, on behalf of Matt Sissel, an Iowa artist and small-business owner.\n\nThe suit had gained little traction in the lower courts, even as it provoked a party-line divide on the legal reasoning. A federal trial judge in Washington upheld the law, as did a unanimous panel of three Democratic-appointed judges.\n\nA larger panel of judges then voted not to reconsider the case. Although the four Republican appointees on the 11-member Washington appeals court would have heard arguments, they also said they would have upheld the law for different reasons.\n\nAt issue was a rarely invoked constitutional provision known as the origination clause, which says that \u201call bills raising revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives.\u201d\n\nRevenue-Raising Bill?\n\nSissel\u2019s lawyers said Obamacare qualified as a revenue-raising bill, in part, because of the 2012 Supreme Court decision interpreting the law as imposing a tax on people who forgo health insurance.\n\nThe three-judge panel rejected that argument, saying that under past Supreme Court cases, the origination clause applies only when a law\u2019s \u201cprimary purpose\u201d is to raise revenue. Judge Judith Rogers said money collected by the government was a \u201cbyproduct\u201d of the law\u2019s effort to encourage participation in the health insurance system.\n\nThe four Republican appointees, led by Judge Brett Kavanaugh, called that conclusion \u201cuntenable,\u201d saying the measure would raise almost $500 billion over 10 years.\n\nKavanaugh said, however, that the law had met the requirement that it originate in the House. When the Senate took up the issue in 2009, it started with a House bill on an unrelated matter and substituted what became the core of Obamacare. The House then approved it, and Obama signed the measure into law.\n\n\u201cCongress\u2019s longstanding practice has been to permit Senate amendments of exactly the kind at issue here,\u201d Kavanaugh said.\n\nThe case is Sissel v.
