This year, however, three of the state\u2019s Supreme Court Justices are hitting the campaign trail in an effort to counteract a movement to get them bounced from the bench \u2013 the first serious challenge to sitting justices in nearly two decades.\n\nJustice Cornelia A. \u201cConnie\u201d Clark, flanked by retired judges and prominent attorneys from across the state, visited the Coffee County Justice Center in Manchester on Monday afternoon, where they encouraged the roughly 50 people in the audience to vote to retain the justices and to urge their friends and neighbors to do the same.\n\nIn addition to Clark, Chief Justice Gary Wade and Justice Sharon Lee will also be on the ballot next month. All three were appointed to the Supreme Court by former governor Phil Bredesen, a Democrat.\n\nA commercial, paid for by Tennessee Forum, began running last weekend that refers to the Supreme Court as \u201cthe most liberal place in Tennessee,\u201d and asserts that \u201cliberal Democrats control our court and threaten your freedom.\u201d The ad goes on to state the justices are \u201cliberal on crime\u201d and \u201cadvanced Obamacare.\u201d\n\n\u201cClearly, we have touched a nerve,\u201d said Susan Kaestner, president of Tennessee Forum, in a press release. \u201cOur ad is thoroughly documented and based in fact, We stand behind our ad and more importantly we stand behind the right of the people of Tennessee to speak the truth about these liberal judges\u2026 Every day Tennesseans are held accountable for their actions at school, work and in their daily life. The Supreme Court should be held just as accountable.\u201d\n\nAlthough the Supreme Court has not heard a case involving the Affordable Care Act, the justices are charged with the responsibility of selecting the state\u2019s attorney general. The state\u2019s current attorney general, Robert Cooper, drew ire from some conservatives when he did not join more than two dozen other states to challenge the law.\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court had an opportunity to pick an attorney general that shared Tennessee values. The instead picked the Tennessee Democrat Party\u2019s lawyer, who then refused to oppose Obamacare,\u201d Kaestner said. \u201cThat is a fact. No matter how the judges and their Obama operative try and spin it, that is the truth.\u201d\n\nThe ad has been denounced by many in the legal community from both sides of the aisle. The Tennessee Bar Association recently polled its membership, with 93 percent of the responding attorneys indicating the justices should be retained.\n\nUnlike the United States Supreme Court, justices on the Tennessee Supreme Court do not receive lifetime appointments.\n\nProspective Tennessee Supreme Court justices are subject to a lengthy screening process by the 15-member Judicial Selection Committee, which narrows the field of applicants down to three top candidates. That list of three names is then forwarded to the governor, who makes an appointment from that list.\n\nOnce on the bench, justices serve eight-year terms. They are subject to a thorough review by the Judicial Performance Evaluation Commission, which must recommend them for retention before their names appear on the ballot. All three justices up for retention this year have successfully cleared the commission\u2019s review process. Copies of the justices\u2019 review reports can be found online at tncourts.gov.\n\nAll appellate court judges throughout the state are subject to retention elections. They do not run under any party affiliation and there are no challengers running against them. Voters will find the names of the appellate court judges up for a retention vote at the end of the lengthy ballot next and will be asked to choose to either retain or replace each individual judge.\n\n\u201cI am here today to tell you that I believe I have passed all the tests the legislature has set in order to be considered, and I believe I\u2019ve passed them overwhelmingly,\u201d Clark said.\n\nDuring their appearance in Manchester on Monday, Clark and her supporters said what is really on the line in August\u2019s election is not only the fate of the three Supreme Court justices on the ballot, but the integrity of the state\u2019s judicial system as a whole.\n\nClark said her role as a Supreme Court justice is simply to uphold the laws enacted by the legislature.\n\n\u201cIt is the legislature, not judges, who make the law,\u201d Clark said. \u201cWe simply take the laws that our legislature has made and it\u2019s our job to uphold them. And it\u2019s our job to uphold them in the same way and apply them equally to every body that comes before us.\n\n\u201cNo matter who you are, when you show up, the judge you see and hear will treat you fairly,\u201d she continued. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have to worry if you\u2019re in the same civic club as that judge or not. You shouldn\u2019t have to worry if you\u2019re in the same political party as that judge or not. You shouldn\u2019t have to worry if you go to the same church or religious institution as that judge or not. You should be able to rely on the fact that no matter what that judge does in their personal lives \u2026 the judge is going to put aside all that and is simply going to listen to the facts and the law. For your Tennessee Supreme court that\u2019s most important of all because the cases that we hear are the cases that develop and advance the law. They are the cases where usually we are the last people that get to speak on an issue.\u201d\n\nJim Henry, an attorney will the Tullahoma firm of Henry, McCord, Bean, Miler, Gabriel & LeBar, said voters are being presented with a choice this August that could affect the judicial system for years to come.\n\n\u201cI think that the situation, as I see it, is that we are at a crossroads in Tennessee in terms of the appellate court and political activity,\u201d Henry said. \u201cWe need to make a choice in this election as to which direction we\u2019re going to go. We have the ability to work towards an independent and impartial judiciary or we can adopt one that is real partisan.\u201d\n\nHenry recommended voters weigh the decision before them from two different perspectives: Evaluating the records and reputations of the three justices on the ballot this year while considering the political motivations of those trying to remove them.\n\n\u201cWe are in a situation where there are political influences. To my knowledge, they are not all from Tennessee, but they are trying to inject a lot of political activity into our appellate court retention election ballots. And, respectfully, that\u2019s not a place you want politics to be,\u201d Henry said. \u201cOur entire judicial system is based on the fact that all the lawyers and all of the litigants buy in to the idea that this is a fair and impartial system of justice\u2026 If we get into a situation where this is politicized, and you don\u2019t have the D or the R after your name, or you know the other side has made bigger donations, no one will ever be satisfied with an adverse ruling\u2026 There will never be a time when that\u2019s justified.\u201d\n\nDon Ray, a retired attorney from Tullahoma, said he is concerned about the amount of money being spent on the effort to oust the justices, adding that anyone who passes up the opportunity to participate in the retention election \u201cplays into the hands of those who oppose and do not want to retain these judges for their own reasons.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here to speak on behalf of the system we have,\u201d Ray said, \u201cand the fact that we cannot allow our system to be controlled by\u2026 people of the world who have a vested financial interests.\u201d\n\nRay said the movement to oust the judges did not seem to be getting any traction until recently, a development which he does not see as a coincidence.\n\n\u201cNow I see the game plan,\u201d he said. \u201cPut the rush on in the last two weeks of the election so first off, no one can answer you back. They [the judges] can\u2019t answer back anyway, really. Then all of a sudden, the minds of the voters are set on the last ad they saw.\u201d\n\nFormer Nashville mayor Bill Purcell, who is also an attorney who went to law school with Clark, echoed his colleague\u2019s sentiments.\n\n\u201cI think this is the most important election that I can remember. This particular election will decide for eight years and arguably for the rest of our lives what kind of court system we will have,\u201d Purcell said. \u201cPeople are sitting at a distance from this state we know some of them are in Washington, we don\u2019t know where the others are, and they are manipulating the flow of money and information in to Tennessee for one purpose and one purpose only \u2013 to change our Supreme Court. Not their Supreme Court, but our Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cThey never tried this before because no one believed it was possible, no one thought it could happen. We were in control of our courts, we knew what kind of courts we had and that\u2019s the way it would stay. For the first time in our history people outside of our state are trying to change that\u2026,\u201d he added. \u201cIf we were, for whatever reason, to allow folks from outside of our state to try to change that we would be sorry, I think not just for eight years but for the rest of our lives.\u201d\n\nAndrea Agardy can be reached by email at tnrept03@lcs.net.", "article_metadata": {"google-site-verification": "DSuZnC9hJQAMvp9aACU2GR1smwoMgHv-RH5LWmQ0SkM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "generator": "WordPress 4.2.2"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb372\"", "article_summary": "Not their Supreme Court, but our Supreme Court.\nUnlike the United States Supreme Court, justices on the Tennessee Supreme Court do not receive lifetime appointments.\nAll three were appointed to the Supreme Court by former governor Phil Bredesen, a Democrat.\nClark said her role as a Supreme Court justice is simply to uphold the laws enacted by the legislature.\nFor your Tennessee Supreme court that\u2019s most important of all because the cases that we hear are the cases that develop and advance the law."}
