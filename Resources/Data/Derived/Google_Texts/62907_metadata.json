The Company\u2019s repurchases may be executed using open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, accelerated share repurchase programs or other transactions. The Company intends to fund repurchases under the new stock repurchase program from cash on hand, available borrowings or proceeds from potential debt or other capital markets transactions.\n\nA listen-only simulcast, as well as a 30-day replay, of LifePoint Hospitals\u2019 fourth quarter and year-end 2013 conference call will be available on line at www.lifepointhospitals.com/news/press-releases today, Friday, February 14, 2014, beginning at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time.\n\nLifePoint Hospitals, Inc. is a leading hospital company focused on providing quality healthcare services close to home.

Numerous factors exist which may cause results to differ from these expectations. Many of the factors that will determine our future results are beyond our ability to control or predict with accuracy. Such forward-looking statements reflect the current expectations and beliefs of the management of LifePoint, are not guarantees of performance and are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that could cause actual results to differ from those described in the forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements may also be subject to other risk factors and uncertainties, including without limitation: (i) the effects related to the enactment and implementation of healthcare reform, the possible enactment of additional federal or state healthcare reforms and possible changes in healthcare reform laws and other federal, state or local laws or regulations affecting the healthcare industry including the timing of the implementation of reform; (ii) the extent to which states support increases, decreases or changes in Medicaid programs, implement healthcare exchanges or alter the provision of healthcare to state residents through regulation or otherwise; (iii) delays in receiving payments for services provided, reductions in Medicare or Medicaid payments (including increased recoveries made by Recovery Audit Contractors (RAC) and similar governmental agents), compared to the timing of expanded coverage; (iv) reductions in reimbursements from commercial payors, whether due to a change in our revenue mix, service mix, reduction in commercial rates or otherwise; (v) our ability to acquire hospitals and other healthcare providers on favorable terms, the business risks and costs associated therewith and the uncertainty in operating and integrating such hospitals and other providers; (vi) our ongoing ability to demonstrate meaningful use of certified electronic health record technology and recognize income for the related Medicare or Medicaid incentive payments; (vii) the failure or closure of employers in our markets, especially those that are dependent on a small number of local employers; (viii) the growth of \u201cbad debt\u201d and \u201cpatient due\u201d accounts, the number of individuals without insurance coverage (or who are underinsured) who seek care at our hospitals, and deterioration in the collectability of these accounts; (ix) changes in general economic conditions nationally and regionally in our markets; (x) whether our core strategies will result in anticipated operating results, including measureable quality and satisfaction improvements; (xi) whether our efforts to reduce the cost of providing healthcare while increasing the quality of care are successful; (xii) the ability to attract, recruit and retain qualified physicians, nurses, medical technicians and other healthcare professionals and the increasing costs associated with doing so, including the direct costs associated with employing physicians and other healthcare professionals; (xiii) the loss of certain physicians in markets where such a loss can have a disproportionate impact on our hospital in such market; (xiv) the application, interpretation and enforcement of increasingly stringent and complex laws and regulations governing our operations and healthcare generally (and changing interpretations of applicable laws and regulations), related enforcement activity and the potentially adverse impact of known and unknown government investigations, litigation and other claims that may be made against us; (xv) any interruption of or restriction in our access to licensed information (and information technology systems) or failure in our ability to integrate changes to LifePoint\u2019s existing information systems or information systems of acquired hospitals; (xvi) the highly competitive nature of the health care business; (xvii) adverse events in states where a large portion of our revenues are concentrated; (xviii) the availability and terms of capital to fund the expansion of our business and improvements to our existing facilities, and any changes in accounting practices; (xix) liabilities resulting from potential malpractice and related legal claims brought against our hospitals or the healthcare providers associated with, or employed by, such hospitals or affiliated entities; (xx) our increased dependence on third parties to provide purchasing, revenue cycle and payroll services and information technology and whether they are able to do so effectively; (xxi) the continued viability of our operations through joint venture entities, the largest of which is Duke LifePoint Healthcare, our partnership with a wholly controlled affiliate of Duke University Health Systems, Inc.; and (xxii) those other risks and uncertainties described from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Therefore, our future results may differ materially from those described in this release.

We compute equivalent admissions by multiplying admissions (inpatient volumes) by the outpatient factor (the sum of gross inpatient revenue and gross outpatient revenue and then dividing the resulting amount by gross inpatient revenue). The equivalent admissions computation \u201cequates\u201d outpatient revenue to the volume measure (admissions) used to measure inpatient volume resulting in a general measure of combined inpatient and outpatient volume. (3) Same-hospital information includes the results of our hospital support center and the same 53 hospital campuses operated during the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012. Same-hospital information excludes the results of our recent acquisitions completed in 2013 and 2012.\n\nLIFEPOINT HOSPITALS, INC. UNAUDITED SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION Dollars in millions, except Diluted EPS amounts Adjusted EBITDA is defined by the Company as earnings before depreciation and amortization; interest expense, net; gain on settlement of pre-acquisition contingent obligation; debt transaction costs; impairment charges; provision for income taxes; loss (income) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes; and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. LifePoint\u2019s management and Board of Directors use Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate the Company\u2019s operating performance and as a measure of performance for incentive compensation purposes. LifePoint\u2019s credit facilities use Adjusted EBITDA for certain financial covenants. The Company believes Adjusted EBITDA is a measure of performance used by some investors, equity analysts and others to make informed investment decisions. In addition, multiples of current or projected Adjusted EBITDA are used to estimate current or prospective enterprise value. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of financial performance under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d), and the items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income, cash flows generated by operating, investing or financing activities or other financial statement data presented in the consolidated financial statements as an indicator of financial performance or liquidity. Because Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement determined in accordance with GAAP and is susceptible to varying calculations, Adjusted EBITDA as presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.
