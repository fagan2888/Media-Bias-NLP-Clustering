Ham\u2019s young-earth creationism represents the distinct tendency of American Christian fundamentalists to reject science and use their religion to defend economic ideas, environmental degradation and anti-science extremism. But these views aren\u2019t actually inherent in Christianity \u2014 they\u2019ve been imposed on the biblical text by politically motivated and theologically inept readers. The solution is not anti-theism but better theological and scientific awareness.\n\nThe vast majority of right-wing Christian fundamentalists in the U.S. are evangelicals, followers of an offshoot of Protestantism. Protestantism is based on the premise that truth about God and his relationship with the world can be discovered by individuals, regardless of their level of education or social status. Because of its roots in a schism motivated by a distrust of religious experts (priests, bishops, the pope), Protestantism today is still highly individualistic. In the United States, Protestantism has been mixed with the similarly individualistic American frontier mythos, fomenting broad anti-intellectualism.\n\nRichard Hofstadter\u2019s classic, \u201cAnti-Intellectualism in American Life,\u201d perfectly summarizes the American distaste for intellectualism and how egalitarian sentiments became intertwined with religion. He and Walter Lippmann point to the first wave of opposition to Darwinian evolution theory, led by William Jennings Bryan, as the quintessential example of the convergence of anti-intellectualism, the egalitarian spirit and religion. Bryan worried about the conflation of Darwinian evolution theory and capitalist economics that allowed elites to declare themselves superior to lower classes. He felt that the teaching of evolution challenged popular democracy: \u201cWhat right have the evolutionists \u2014 a relatively small percentage of the population \u2014 to teach at public expense a so-called scientific interpretation of the Bible when orthodox Christians are not permitted to teach an orthodox interpretation of the Bible?\u201d He notes further, \u201cThe one beauty of the word of God, is that it does not take an expert to understand it.\u201d\n\nThis American distrust of experts isn\u2019t confined to religion. It explains the popularity of books like \u201cWrong\u201d by David Freedman (a book that purports to show \u201cwhy experts are wrong\u201d) that take those snobbish \u201cexperts\u201d down a peg. The delightfully cynical H.L. Mencken writes,\n\nThe agents of such quackeries gain their converts by the simple process of reducing the inordinately complex to the absurdly simple. Unless a man is already equipped with a considerable knowledge of chemistry, bacteriology and physiology, no one can ever hope to make him understand what is meant by the term anaphylaxis, but any man, if only he be idiot enough, can grasp the whole theory of chiropractic in twenty minutes.\n\nThus, an American need not understand economics to challenge Keynes, nor possess a PhD to question climate change, nor to have read Darwin to declare his entire book a fraud. One need not read journals, for Gladwell suffices, and Jenny McCarthy\u2019s personal anecdotes trump the Institute of Medicine and National Academy of Sciences.\n\nThe irony of modern American Christian right-wing fundamentalism is that, for all its talk of tradition, it is a radically new way to read the Bible. The strict constructionist, or literal fundamentalist, biblical method of interpretation was invented in the 19th century. America at this time experienced rapid social change that played a key role in creating the fundamentalism that now lies at the core of the religious right. The Industrial Revolution gave rise to the idea that technological progress is the way forward. American Protestants worried that all this science would encroach on their religious beliefs, so they turned to the Bible as the source of all knowledge \u2014 scientific and spiritual. During a time when Darwin\u2019s followers were trying to explain everything in terms of evolutionary theory, American Protestants refused to look for truth outside their interpretation of Scripture.\n\nIn \u201cFundamentalism and American Culture,\u201d George Marsden describes fundamentalism as \u201cessentially the extreme and agonized defense of a dying way of life.\u201d The American Protestant response to the Industrial Revolution was engendered by the fear that a small cabal of experts would dictate to Americans how to live their lives and that science would somehow replace their religion. In truth, the Christian tradition provides little support for the fundamentalist doctrines that arose during this period. Augustine believed that science and religion need not be in competition, and the Catholic Church has long held that evolution does not contradict the Church\u2019s teachings. Fundamentalists who deny climate change and evolution have simply read their simplistic understanding of science into biblical texts.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Fundamentalism isn't really about the Bible; it's about politics.
