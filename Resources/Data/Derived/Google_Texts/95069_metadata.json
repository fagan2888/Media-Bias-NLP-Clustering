It is true that in many nations predominated by Muslims, women are second-class citizens and little more than property mandated to do the will of their husbands, but if that is the criteria for invasion and war, America should be attacked for allowing Republicans to mistreat women and attempt to put them in their biblical roles as birth machines and slaves.\n\nShortly after the 2012 general election, the RNC assessed the electoral damage due to their anti-women agenda and concluded that a friendlier outreach effort would assuage the harm their misogynistic and patriarchal agenda caused them. However, instead of de-escalating their war against women, they ratcheted up their attacks that continue unabated nearly a year after the election loss that drove them to reconsider aggressively attacking women\u2019s rights. Since the beginning of 2013, Republicans passed Draconian laws restricting women\u2019s right to choose their own reproductive health, and recently a few Americans were outraged that ALEC\u2019s Texas voter ID law disenfranchises married women by suppressing their right to vote. However horrendous restricting women\u2019s right to vote may be, an oft-forgotten attack in the Republican war against women is the continued assault on the Affordable care Act (ACA).\n\nThe ongoing war against the ACA by Republican messiah Ted Cruz is an attack on women that he enlisted ALEC\u2019s assistance to continue. In 2011, ALEC created the \u201cState Legislators Guide to Repealing Obamacare\u201d that detailed how to dismantle the ACA locally, and it was Cruz who co-authored the report describing Obamacare as \u201cunconstitutional federal overreach and violation of 10th Amendment rights\u201d that would become ALEC\u2019s model legislation to upend the Affordable Care Act. Of course Republican misogynists and patriarchs lust to derail the Affordable Care Act; because besides giving millions of Americans access to affordable health care insurance, it restricts insurance companies from discriminating against women. If there is anything conservative Christians cannot and will not comport, it is prohibiting powerful men from victimizing women.\n\nBefore the ACA, the private insurance industry forced women to pay higher premiums than men and restricted coverage that is unique to women\u2019s needs, but the health law Republicans detest addressed those discriminatory health and economic practices and brought them to a long-overdue end. The health law prohibited insurance companies from denying coverage for being a woman (a pre-existing condition), mandated that new health plans cover maternity care, gives women access to depression screenings, allows them a mammogram every two years, access to counseling for domestic violence at no cost, and ensures women will not have a co-pay for birth control. American women should make no mistake that one of the primary reasons Republicans hate the ACA is for its benefits to women they believe are second class citizens at the mercy of men as mandated in the Christian bible.\n\nTed Cruz knows all about keeping women subjugated to men because his mentor, father, and preacher Rafael Cruz expounds that \u201cGod commands us men to teach your wife, but unfortunately, unfortunately, in too many Christian homes, the role of the priest is assumed by the wife.\u201d The elder Cruz is not alone in his biblical subversion of women, and although Republicans hardly espouse evangelicals\u2019 hate toward women publicly, there is a phalanx of conservative Christians speaking on their behalf.\n\nFor example, Pat Robertson said, \u201cThe feminist agenda is not about equal rights for women. It is about a socialist, anti-family political movement that encourages women to leave their husbands, kill their children, practice witchcraft, destroy capitalism, and become lesbians.\u201d He also opined that if women get married, they \u201caccept the headship of a man, your husband; the husband is the head of the wife, and that\u2019s the way it is, period.\u201d Pat Buchanan concurred with Robertson and claimed \u201cRail as they will about \u2018discrimination,\u2019 women are simply not endowed by nature with the same measures of single-minded ambition and the will to succeed\u201d as a man and it explains the Republican opposition to equal pay for equal work and the Equal Rights Amendment. It is no wonder that in Texas, Republicans are disenfranchising women\u2019s right to vote to keep them politically impotent that is a very popular prospect among Christian conservatives.\n\nA teabag leader of the Central Mississippi Tea Party thinks that women shouldn\u2019t be allowed to cast a ballot because according to her \u201cthere is nothing worse than a bunch of mean, hateful women that are diabolical in how they can skewer a person. I do not see that in men.\u201d Another tea party activist, regular Fox News guest, preacher, and founder of an organization Sean Hannity serves as an advisory board member said that America\u2019s greatest mistake was allowing women the right to vote and longed for \u201cthe good old days when men knew that women are crazy and knew how to deal with them.\u201d If America\u2019s women think for one second that Republicans adhering to conservative Christianity would not like to take America back to the good old days when men knew how to \u201cdeal with them\u201d they can look at Republican-controlled states and understand the right to vote or control their reproductive health are just opening salvos in the war against women.\n\nThe source of the concept that women are second class citizens is founded in the bible that Christian conservatives claim is the blueprint for America that many Republicans subscribe to in state legislatures and the U.S. Congress as well. Shortly after the start of the 113th Congress, failed vice-presidential candidate Paul Ryan re-introduced a fetal personhood bill that Republican-controlled states have inserted in state budgets and bills like the Preborn Pain Act introduced by the Texas ALEC Chair, Representative Jodie Laubenberg (R). The idea that women are unqualified to vote, do not deserve equality in healthcare costs, should not earn equal pay, or are unqualified to make their own decisions regarding their reproductive health is so deeply ingrained in Christian conservative circles that even Republican women support their subjection to patriarchs in Republican ranks.\n\nAmerican women make up 51% of the population in this country, but they are perpetually under-represented and assailed as second-class citizens underserving of equal rights. The assault on the Affordable Care Act is as much about allowing the insurance industry to discriminate against women with Republicans\u2019 blessings as it is about healthcare for uninsured Americans, and it is likely that given the opportunity many Republicans would restrict women\u2019s right to vote unless they follow their Republican husbands\u2019 orders and vote for Christian conservatives. If women thought for a second that Republicans learned from their mistakes in the 2012 election, they just need to look around and see that misogyny, patriarchal domination, and religious fervor to put them in their biblical role as subservient is raging on and unfortunately, there is no superpower going to come to their aid except themselves; if they are allowed to vote.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The ongoing war against the ACA by Republican messiah Ted Cruz is an attack on women that he enlisted ALEC's assistance to continue.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Rmuse", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "The ongoing war against the ACA by Republican messiah Ted Cruz is an attack on women that he enlisted ALEC's assistance to continue.", "title": "The Republican War on the ACA Is An Attack On Women", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2013/11/03/republican-war-aca-attack-women.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/American-Burkha.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-11-03T21:26:47+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Featured News,affordable care act,ALEC,Central Mississippi Tea Party,Congress,feminism,health law,insurance industry,Obamacare,Pat Buchanan,paul ryan,Rafael Cruz,teabagger leader,Ted Cruz,Texas,texas voter suppression,War on Women,Women's Rights,Women's suffrage,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Featured News", "published_time": "2013-11-03T21:26:47+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-03T21:26:47+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "affordable care act, ALEC, Central Mississippi Tea Party, Congress, feminism, health law, insurance industry, Obamacare, Pat Buchanan, paul ryan, Rafael Cruz, teabagger leader, Ted Cruz, Texas, texas voter suppression, War on Women, Women's Rights, Women's suffrage"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf94f\"", "article_summary": "However horrendous restricting women\u2019s right to vote may be, an oft-forgotten attack in the Republican war against women is the continued assault on the Affordable care Act (ACA).\nThe ongoing war against the ACA by Republican messiah Ted Cruz is an attack on women that he enlisted ALEC\u2019s assistance to continue.\nIf there is anything conservative Christians cannot and will not comport, it is prohibiting powerful men from victimizing women.\nHowever, instead of de-escalating their war against women, they ratcheted up their attacks that continue unabated nearly a year after the election loss that drove them to reconsider aggressively attacking women\u2019s rights.\nAfter America invaded Iraq and the people learned Bush and Cheney fabricated evidence to launch an unprovoked war, Republicans defended the nation\u2019s intervention in the Middle East because Arab women were forced to be in subjection to men."}
