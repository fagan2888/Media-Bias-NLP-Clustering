Photo: Joe Armao\n\nWhen Jake Docker discovered the NSW government was about to ban international commercial surrogacy in 2010, he immediately signed a contract with an agency in India to ensure he would be able to achieve his dream of fatherhood.\n\nThe father of twin daughters, Pippa and Millie, born to a surrogate in India in January last year, now questions why he rushed into it, saying hundreds of couples continue to skirt the law.\n\nSince March 2011, NSW parents who engage in compensated surrogacy overseas have risked two years' imprisonment and fines of $275,000, although those who signed contracts with agencies before that date are protected.\n\nJake Docker with his 18-month-old twin daughters Millie (blue) and Pippa (red).

Nobody has been prosecuted under that law,\" he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The laws banning commercial surrogacy are rubbish laws which haven\u2019t had an effect on anybody.\"\n\nBut Mr Docker, who is gay, is deeply worried that legal issues raised after baby Gammy might lead to a crackdown on overseas commercial surrogacy, which is only illegal in NSW, the ACT and Queensland.\n\n\"I am concerned there will be a federal legislation that bans international commercial surrogacy outright,\" he said. \"That\u2019s punitive. It\u2019s a real shame.\"\n\nThe 28-year-old said further restrictions on surrogacy would create a black market for babies.\n\n\"Stamping out Australians doing commercial surrogacy anywhere in the world is not the answer,\" he said. \"It will only drive it underground, it will only marginalise people that are trying to access surrogacy. People who really want to have a baby will always find a way.\"\n\nHe has nothing but praise for the Indian clinic which handled his surrogacy arrangement but he encountered problems with the Indian government when trying to take his babies home.\n\n\"I was put through the ringer by the [former] minister of home affairs in India,\" he said. \"I was interrogated by one of the senior officials there who told me I could be taking them to harvest their organs and all sorts of stuff.\n\n\"They do interrogate you and give you a hard time about taking the babies out of the country and that\u2019s after you already have a birth certificate and an Australian passport for them.\"\n\nMr Docker, who works in law enforcement, turned to surrogacy after exhausting other options in Australia, such as inter-country or local adoption.\n\n\u2018\u2018I went on the adoption waiting list in NSW a couple of years ago and the response was: \u2018When a child in need of adoption becomes available, we\u2019ll get back to you\u2019. I\u2019ve never had an email and that was about four years ago,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018I looked at inter-country adoption. If you say that you\u2019re gay, don\u2019t even bother.\u2019\u2019\n\nMr Docker, who moved from Sydney to Melbourne six weeks ago to find more family-friendly accommodation for his toddlers , still has 11 embryos in storage in India and hopes to have more children.\n\n\u2018\u2018As a single parent, it\u2019s only finances that are preventing me from having more, but I wouldn\u2019t change my circumstances for the world. I love being a dad.\u2019\u2019", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "NSW", "application-name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "og": {"site_name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "description": "Jake Docker, a father of twins born via an Indian surrogate last year, says discussed changes to international surrogacy laws will force the industry underground, creating black-market babies.", "title": "Father of surrogate twins, Jake Docker, says laws are a joke", "url": "http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/father-of-surrogate-twins-jake-docker-says-laws-are-a-joke-20140806-100wx7.html", "image": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/1/0/1/g/2/6/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.100wx7.png/1407670082811.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/1/0/1/g/2/6/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.100wx7.png/1407670082811.jpg"}, "title": "Father of surrogate twins, Jake Docker, says laws are a joke", "description": "Jake Docker, a father of twins born via an Indian surrogate last year, says discussed changes to international surrogacy laws will force the industry underground, creating black-market babies.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@smh"}, "robots": "ACAP allow-present prohibited-modification=annotation", "msapplication-tooltip": "Open The Sydney Morning Herald", "fb": {"app_id": 193677504039845}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.smh.com.au", "msapplication-task": "name=Weather;action-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/weather;icon-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/favicon.ico;", "description": "Jake Docker, a father of twins born via an Indian surrogate last year, says discussed changes to international surrogacy laws will force the industry ..."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf11e\"", "article_summary": "Jake Docker entered an arrangement with an Indian surrogate for his 18-month-old twin daughters Millie (blue) and Pippa (red).\nAdvertisement\"The laws banning commercial surrogacy are rubbish laws which haven\u2019t had an effect on anybody.\"\nJake Docker with his 18-month-old twin daughters Millie (blue) and Pippa (red).\n\"I am concerned there will be a federal legislation that bans international commercial surrogacy outright,\" he said.\n\"Stamping out Australians doing commercial surrogacy anywhere in the world is not the answer,\" he said."}
