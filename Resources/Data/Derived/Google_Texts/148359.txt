The White House has reportedly delayed another key provision of the Affordable Care Act — one that prevents employers from providing better health care to top executives versus employees.

According to the New York Times, “Tax officials said they would not enforce the provision this year because they had yet to issue regulations for employers to follow.”

President Barack Obama’s landmark health law prohibits employers from discriminating “in favor of highly compensated individuals” when determining benefits or eligibility, the Times reports.

But, as the Times notes, “translating that goal into reality has proved difficult.”

IRS officials reportedly are perplexed at how to define “highly compensated” and are not sure exactly what would qualify as discrimination.

The news comes just days after the White House announced on Tuesday that it would extend the Obamacare enrollment deadline for individuals who have pre-existing conditions.
