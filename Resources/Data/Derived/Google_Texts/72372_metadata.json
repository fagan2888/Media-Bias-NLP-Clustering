Texas is second in the number of enrollees for 2016, with 224,791 signups.\n\nAbout 71 percent of the uninsured individuals selecting plans want in-person help, said Jessica Kendall with the Families USA, a non-partisan group that supports enrollment efforts on the marketplace.\n\n\u201cSo we know people want help applying for coverage,\u201d Kendall said. \u201cAnd we know when they go in to actually get that help, it\u2019s trying to figure out what does this actually mean, what\u2019s a premium, what\u2019s a deductible, and how do I pick the best plan for me.\u201d\n\nConsumers must buy insurance by Dec. 15 to have health care by Jan. 1, a requirement of the Affordable Care Act. Most consumers must carry insurance, or pay a penalty that jumps to $695 dollars or 2 percent of income.\n\nGary Brock of Volusia County said he has bought an insurance plan on HealthCare.gov three years in a row. HealthCare.gov is the only place where individuals can apply and qualify for subsidies to help with monthly premiums.\n\n\u201cLast year I got some cactus shoots in my eye,\u201d Brock said. \u201cI thought I was going blind. I went to the hospital, and thank God I had the insurance. It only cost me $100. That could have wiped me right out.\u201d\n\nAbe Aboraya is a reporter at WMFE in Orlando.
