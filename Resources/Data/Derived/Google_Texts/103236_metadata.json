The exercises teach communication and teamwork skills, facilitators say.\n\n\"Medicine is a team sport,\" Richard Sterns, M.D., internal medicine residency program director at the hospital, told the publication. \"Teamwork is essential for safety, efficiency and patient satisfaction.\"\n\nCommunication between doctors and nurses is more important than ever as healthcare moves toward more collaborative, team-based care models. \"But there are several factors that can make effective communication between nurses and physicians particularly difficult to achieve,\" Courtney H. Lyder, dean and professor of the UCLA School of Nursing, wrote in a 2013 Hospital Impact post. \"Including historic tension; conflicting viewpoints based on education, training, communication style; and terminology and existing communication processes that are inefficient at best.\"\n\nLyder called for more collaborative training programs between doctors, nurses and other staff to foster those communication skills and teach a team-based approach. Two new programs, launched at the University of Virginia Medical Center, offer a new approach to improve communication between doctors and nurses, while increasing patient safety and preventing medical errors, FierceHealthcare previously reported.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nHow to spark doc-nurse communication\n\nSimulation lab, war room help prevent medical errors, improve doc-nurse communication\n\nStudy: OR simulations improve teamwork\n\nSimulation training effective in healthcare", "article_metadata": {"description": "Although historically the\u00a0communication between doctors, nurses\u00a0and other hospital staff is less than perfect, one New York state hospital is teaching collaboration right from the start with a program that brings first-year internal medicine and pharmacy residents, nurse practitioner students and respiratory therapists together.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Although historically the\u00a0communication between doctors, nurses\u00a0and other hospital staff is less than perfect, one New York state hospital is teaching collaboration right from the start with a program that brings first-year internal medicine and pharmacy residents, nurse practitioner students and respiratory therapists together.", "title": "Hospital boot camp teaches docs, nurses teamwork skills", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/hospital-boot-camp-teaches-docs-nurses-teamwork-skills/2014-07-17", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "doctor nurse communication,HR & Workforce Management,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes,residents,Rochester General Hospital,simulation programs,team-based care", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "HR & Workforce Management,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1c68\"", "article_summary": "\"Including historic tension; conflicting viewpoints based on education, training, communication style; and terminology and existing communication processes that are inefficient at best.\"\nThe exercises teach communication and teamwork skills, facilitators say.\nLyder called for more collaborative training programs between doctors, nurses and other staff to foster those communication skills and teach a team-based approach.\nCommunication between doctors and nurses is more important than ever as healthcare moves toward more collaborative, team-based care models.\n\"Medicine is a team sport,\" Richard Sterns, M.D., internal medicine residency program director at the hospital, told the publication."}
