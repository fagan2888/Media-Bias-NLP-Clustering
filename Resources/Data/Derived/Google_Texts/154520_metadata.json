It was good luck, because it forced me to encounter one of the ways Republicans are lying to the country about their defund/delay/repeal Obamacare hostage-taking. Tyler insisted shutting down the government was reasonable recourse for his party because the Affordable Care Act was \u201crammed through in the middle of the night without a single Republican vote.\u201d\n\nI Googled \u201cObamacare\u201d and \u201crammed through\u201d to find that\u2019s a regular GOP talking point, of course. I also found the single worst piece of punditry on our current political crisis, by Michael Barone on Real Clear Politics, using the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to indict President Obama and the Affordable Care Act. I\u2019ll get to that in a minute.\n\nFirst, let me demolish Tyler\u2019s claim that the ACA was \u201crammed through\u201d Congress without deliberation or debate, part of a pattern of Obama failing to negotiate with Congress. Well, I knew that was a lie, and I said so to Tyler and host Karen Finney. In fact, the ACA was the result of more than a year of congressional committee hearings in which progressive ideas like single payer or a public option were jettisoned, and hundreds of GOP amendments to the law were accepted, in exchange for zero Republican votes. Sen. Max Baucus, in particular, drove an eight-month bipartisan process via the Senate Finance Committee in which he and ranking Republican Chuck Grassley held dozens of hearings, released joint \u201cpolicy option\u201d papers and finally presided over 31 meetings lasting 60 hours with the so-called \u201cGang of Six\u201d \u2013 Baucus and Grassley plus Kent Conrad, D-N.D., Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., and Mike Enzi, R-Wyo. \u2014 to try to hammer out a compromise that would attract GOP support. (A Twitter friend shared this helpful history of the Finance Committee\u2019s tortuous process.)\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t until I read the Finance Committee summary of its work on the ACA that I fully experienced the inanity of Tyler\u2019s argument. It\u2019s actually painful to read. In fact, it was the administration\u2019s determination to compromise, and to let the centrist Baucus drive the process, that led Democrats to head into the disastrous August 2009 recess without an actual bill they could tout, let alone defend \u2013 and that vacuum was filled by Tea Party hatred at town halls that Rep. Todd Akin (remember him?) appreciatively labeled \u201ctown hells\u201d for Democrats.\n\nAnd of course it was August when Grassley echoed Sarah Palin\u2019s death panels lie and claimed Obama wanted \u201cto pull the plug on Grandma.\u201d Still, Baucus worked to reach a deal with him, accepting his amendments to the final bill passed by the Finance Committee, along with amendments by Enzi, Snowe and other GOP members. But he never won a single vote from them. Despite that history of desperate efforts to find common ground and win over Republicans, Republicans lie and say it didn\u2019t happen.\n\nThe main reason for GOP intransigence, of course, especially in the Senate, was Minority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s widely publicized determination to hold his caucus together to deny the new president any victories on his agenda. On healthcare, in particular, McConnell himself told the New York Times, \u201cIt was absolutely critical that everybody be together because if the proponents of the bill were able to say it was bipartisan, it tended to convey to the public that this is O.K., they must have figured it out. It\u2019s either bipartisan or it isn\u2019t.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "They ignore a year of hearings and desperate bargaining on Obamacare.
