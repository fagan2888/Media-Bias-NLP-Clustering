I no longer have confidence in you. I\u2019ve asked my friends, and they all agree. Only 7 percent of my fellow Americans now tell Gallup they have either a \u201cgreat deal\u201d or \u201cquite of lot\u201d of confidence in you. A mere 15 percent approve of the way you\u2019re handling your job. They never really liked your friends \u2014 big business, organized labor and the banks \u2014 but now they tell me they have more confidence in each of them than they have in you.\n\nOur relationship has been falling apart for years. Remember the 1970s? Back then, around two-fifths of my friends thought you could be trusted. And while I didn\u2019t ask them exactly the same question in the 1960s, they sure seemed to trust you even more back then.\n\nEvery year I keep thinking things can\u2019t get worse, but then you disappoint me again. How much longer can this go on?\n\nI\u2019ve searched for explanations. Perhaps the weak economy is to blame for our recent fights; after all, unemployment takes its toll on most relationships. Upon careful reflection I can see that the ups and downs in our relationship track the ups and downs of the economy. For sure, things between us seemed to improve during the long boom in the 1990s. But this doesn\u2019t explain our long-term decline.\n\nConfidence in Congress in Free Fall The proportion who express a \"great deal\" or \"quite a lot\" of confidence in Congress has plummeted to a new low of 7 percent. % 40 30 20 10 0 7% 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2014 % 40 30 20 10 0 7% 1980 1990 2000 2014\n\nI had hoped that this year would be different. The economy is improving, and in any case, it\u2019s hard to see how things could get worse between us. But your behavior over the past year proved me wrong, and we find our relationship at an all-time low.\n\nWith the bonds between us unraveling and the midterm elections fast approaching, is it time for you and me to separate?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMy friends all say yes, but I\u2019m just not ready. We stick it out, you and I. Think back to June 2012, when only 13 percent of Americans expressed confidence in you; yet only a few months later, we decided to stay together, re-electing over 90 percent of those who ran.\n\nMy therapist calls it an abusive relationship; my political scientist calls it Fenno\u2019s Paradox: Even if I don\u2019t like you as a whole, I love the small part of you that comes from my district. It\u2019s that love that keeps us together. I know you\u2019ll continue to treat me badly, but I don\u2019t see any other option.\n\nI don\u2019t blame you. After all, if I don\u2019t really tell you what I want, how would you know to act any other way? I know that you could be better; I just give you no reason to try. The failure\u2019s all mine.\n\nSweetie, it\u2019s not you, it\u2019s me.\n\n(Full disclosure: I consult for Gallup as a Senior Scientist, although I did not work on this particular poll.)", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140619163603, "twitter": {"description": "Only 7 percent of Americans say they are confident in Congress, a new low, but that won\u2019t keep us from re-electing our local representatives.", "title": "Congress and Us: A Hate-Love Relationship", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/20/upshot/congress-and-us-a-hate-love-relationship.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002950792"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "creator": "JustinWolfers", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/06/20/upshot/20up-approval-chart-1403204944912/20up-approval-chart-1403204944912-thumbLarge.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/20/upshot/congress-and-us-a-hate-love-relationship.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002950792", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/20/upshot/congress-and-us-a-hate-love-relationship.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "upshot", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/upshot/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "June 19, 2014", "edt": "The New York Times on the Web", "org": "Senate", "keywords": "United States Politics and Government,Polls and Public Opinion,House of Representatives,Senate", "news_keywords": "Senate", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Justin Wolfers", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/06/20/upshot/20up-approval-chart-1403204944912/20up-approval-chart-1403204944912-thumbLarge.png", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By JUSTIN WOLFERS", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Only 7 percent of Americans say they are confident in Congress, a new low, but that won\u2019t keep us from re-electing our local representatives.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/06/20/upshot/20up-approval-chart-1403204944912/20up-approval-chart-1403204944912-thumbStandard.png", "description": "Only 7 percent of Americans say they are confident in Congress, a new low, but that won\u2019t keep us from re-electing our local representatives.", "CG": "upshot", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "June 19, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/upshot", "section": "The Upshot", "modified": "2014-06-19", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/upshot/index.jsonp", "tag": "Senate", "published": "2014-06-19", "section-taxonomy-id": "D64FAE4C-4425-4E5A-B898-6C8CB59F9957"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "slug": "20up-approval", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140619171932, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/20/upshot/congress-and-us-a-hate-love-relationship.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/06/20/upshot/20up-approval-chart-1403204944912/20up-approval-chart-1403204944912-videoSixteenByNine1050.png", "type": "article", "description": "Only 7 percent of Americans say they are confident in Congress, a new low, but that won\u2019t keep us from re-electing our local representatives.", "title": "Congress and Us: A Hate-Love Relationship"}, "pdate": 20140619, "des": "Polls and Public Opinion", "articleid": 100000002950792, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Congress and Us: A Hate-Love Relationship", "col": "Pulse of the People", "PST": "News"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda827\"", "article_summary": "Confidence in Congress in Free Fall The proportion who express a \"great deal\" or \"quite a lot\" of confidence in Congress has plummeted to a new low of 7 percent.\nDear Congress: Our relationship has soured.\nBut your behavior over the past year proved me wrong, and we find our relationship at an all-time low.\nUpon careful reflection I can see that the ups and downs in our relationship track the ups and downs of the economy.\nAfter all, if I don\u2019t really tell you what I want, how would you know to act any other way?"}
