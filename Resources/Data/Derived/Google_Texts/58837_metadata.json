Combine Booker and Dinwiddie and you get names that sound like cartoon characters or villains in a Harry Potter novel.\n\nYet Askia Booker and guard-mate Spencer Dinwiddie are certainly deserving of one. Dinbooker or Bookwiddie or whatever you want to call them combined for 50 points to lead 20th-ranked Colorado to a 100-91 win over 10th-ranked Oregon on Sunday afternoon before 10,398 delirious fans at the Coors Events Center.\n\nBooker scored a game-high 27 points and Dinwiddie wove Harry Potter wizardry in scoring 13 of his 23 in a key 5\u00bd-minute stretch in the second half.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to tell which junior is more important. Dinwiddie is the team\u2019s leading scorer and point guard, a likely early NBA entry and the team\u2019s conscience.\n\nBut listen to the team sage spin wise on the importance of Booker, the sniper who hit 8-of-16 shots Sunday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty simple,\u201d Dinwiddie said. \u201cWhen he plays really well, we play really well. We kind of go as he goes. Me, Josh (Scott) and Xavier (Johnson) don\u2019t change that much. Xavier can be a little up and down. No offense, but Askia knows he can be up and down.\n\n\u201cWhen he\u2019s up we are one good team, and when he\u2019s down we struggle.\u201d\n\nColorado (13-2, 2-0 Pac-12), off to its best 15-game start since its 1968-69 Big Eight championship season, actually looked like a great team. It upgraded the adjective in the second half when it halted an attack from the highest-scoring team in the country.\n\nBooker converted a three-point play, hit an 18-footer and made four straight foul shots to turn a precarious 74-72 lead to 94-86 with 1:30 left.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really fun,\u201d Booker said. \u201cI thank my teammates for getting me the ball in the right positions.\u201d\n\nHowever, Dinwiddie saved the Buffaloes first. After Colorado shot a fiery 56 percent in the first half, Oregon went to a zone that baffled the Buffs for more than five minutes.\n\nUNLV transfer Mike Moser, who had a team-high 24 points, scored eight straight for a 58-48 lead. That\u2019s when Dinwiddie went Chris Paul. He made a lay-in, three straight 3-pointers and two free throws to break Oregon\u2019s zone and take a 72-66 lead.\n\n\u201cWe want Spencer to be aggressive,\u201d CU coach Tad Boyle said. \u201cHe has the ability to score. He\u2019s really hard to keep in front of. He\u2019s got great size, he can finish, he gets to the foul line.\u201d\n\nHe and Booker nearly built a timeshare at the foul line. Booker went 10-of-12 and Dinwiddie 10-of-11 as the team made 33-of-39 (.846). None of this produced any gripes about officiating from Oregon coach Dana Altman, whose Ducks (13-1, 1-1) were trying to go 14-0 for the first time since 1937-38.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to take anything away from (Booker and Dinwiddie),\u201d Altman said, \u201cbut we didn\u2019t guard them.\u201d\n\nOr anyone else, for that matter. The Buffs finished shooting .564 (31-of-55). Scott had 15 points and 12 rebounds for his fifth straight double-double.\n\nAnd don\u2019t forget about the sixth man: Coors. It marked the fifth straight win over a ranked team at home.\n\n\u201cNo question,\u201d Boyle said. \u201cWe\u2019re a little bit further along with the youth of this team, and the way this schedule was devised, than maybe I even thought.\u201d\n\nJohn Henderson: jhenderson@ denverpost.com or twitter.com/ johnhendersondp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado knocks off No. 10 Oregon hoops in fast-paced Boulder bust-out", "title": "Colorado knocks off No. 10 Oregon hoops in fast-paced Boulder bust-out", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/01/05/colorado-knocks-off-no-10-oregon-hoops-in-fast-paced-boulder-bust-out/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140105__colorado-buffs-oregon-600p1.jpg", "height": 600}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140105__colorado-buffs-oregon-600p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-05T17:30:54+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T01:42:28+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce262\"", "article_summary": "After Colorado shot a fiery 56 percent in the first half, Oregon went to a zone that baffled the Buffs for more than five minutes.\nThat\u2019s when Dinwiddie went Chris Paul.\nHe\u2019s really hard to keep in front of.\nCombine Booker and Dinwiddie and you get names that sound like cartoon characters or villains in a Harry Potter novel.\nBooker went 10-of-12 and Dinwiddie 10-of-11 as the team made 33-of-39 (.846)."}
