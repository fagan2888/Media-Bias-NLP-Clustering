Fran Millar, New Georgia Project, voter suppression, Elections News, News, Politics News\n\nGeorgia Republicans are anxious. The bright red state stays that way because African-Americans and Latinos are less likely to vote than white people. Democrats are trying to change that this year \u2013 Michelle Nunn has a decent chance of picking up a Republican-held Senate seat, while Jason Carter threatens Gov. Nathan Deal \u2014 and the GOP is fighting back.\n\nState GOP leaders are ever more openly admitting that they\u2019re threatened by black voter participation. And now the state\u2019s top election official, caught on tape warning that turning out \u201cminority voters\u201d is the key to a Democratic victory, is accused of harassing a key voter registration project run by the pastor of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s Ebenezer Baptist Church and an African-American state legislator.\n\nEarlier this week state Sen. Fran Millar got national attention when he railed against a decision by Atlanta\u2019s DeKalb County to expand Sunday voting and open a new polling place at a shopping mall near black churches. \u201cHow ironic! Michele [sic] Obama comes to town and Chicago politics comes to DeKalb,\u201d Millar railed in response, calling the move \u201cblatantly partisan.\u201d\n\nOf course Sunday voting is a national phenomenon, available to citizens of all races \u2013 although it must be said that once black churches began to organize \u201cSouls to the Polls\u201d events after church, it suddenly became controversial on the right, and states like Wisconsin have limited it sharply. The spectacle of pro-Christian Republicans trying to keep other Christians from voting has always been vexing, and it\u2019s hard to conclude it has to do with anything but race.\n\nCriticized for his reply, Millar didn\u2019t back down, posting on Facebook: \u201cI would prefer more educated voters than a greater increase in the number of voters.\u201d Yes, that does imply he thinks black voters are less educated. He added: \u201cIf you don\u2019t believe this is an effort to maximize Democratic voters, than you are not a realist. This is a partisan stunt and I hope it can be stopped.\u201d\n\nBut Democrats see a partisan stunt in a move by GOP Secretary of State Brian Kemp to subpoena the records of the New Georgia Project, the state\u2019s largest voter registration effort, alleging the group has committed voter fraud. And by records, Kemp means every imaginable record \u2013 you can see the subpoena here. It could tie up the group indefinitely.\n\nNew Georgia Project co-director Stacey Abrams, the House minority leader, says that out of 85,000 registrations, the group was aware of roughly 25 complaints about incomplete forms. \u201cThe complaints we were aware of, we\u2019ve worked very closely with the secretary of state\u2019s office to resolve,\u201d Abrams told the Atlanta Journal Constitution. \u201cIn fact, the first time there was a complaint, I personally called [Kemp] and told him about our project, because I wanted to make sure we were working with the secretary of state\u2019s office to get this work done, given how massive a project this would be.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The GOP secretary of state warned supporters \u201cminority voters\u201d are key to a Dem win.
