A photo of President Obama with his foot up on the Oval Office desk sent Americans into a tizzy Sunday asking where his respect for the highest office in the land went, with one person saying, “Get your damn foot off the people’s desk.”

The Drudge Report published the photo and Twitter exploded with reaction from people complaining about Obama’s foot on a piece of historical furniture to the gun shape he’s making with his right hand. To be fair, though, Obama is not the first president to have his feet up on the desk or his jacket off in the Oval Office.

Here are some of the tweets via Twitchy and Twitter, kicked off by Lou Dobbs:
