Imagine what would happen in a hurricane evacuation. Or a PGA Championship.\n\nOr after another couple of big ol\u2019 subdivisions are built.\n\nNow, there probably isn\u2019t anyone \u2014 outside of developers \u2014 who wouldn\u2019t like to see Johns Island remain rural farmland forever, a slice of magical Lowcountry nature that, until the past century, looked much as it always had.\n\nBut that place is gone. Sorry, it\u2019s true.\n\nThe farms are failing and, outside of the Legares, there are few actual landowners keeping up their end of the bargain. It\u2019s not their fault. Farming isn\u2019t what it used to be, and more and more people are forced to sell off their land to survive.\n\nAnd that land becomes subdivisions.\n\nAlready the traffic is too great. There are only two roads off one of the biggest islands on the East Coast. It\u2019s crazy, as the flooding proved.\n\n\u201cIf you want to stick your head in the sand, you can ignore the growth,\u201d says state Rep. Chip Limehouse. \u201cOr you can plan for the future.\u201d\n\nHe is absolutely right. But nostalgia and a gallant but useless attempt to preserve the past has just about taken away any option.\n\nIf state and local officials don\u2019t act quickly, I-526 will die once again.\n\nSniffing out our money\n\nThe county and state are currently at loggerheads over who will be responsible for cost overruns and defending the lawsuits that will inevitably arise if I-526 moves forward.\n\nIt\u2019s been a brilliant strategy by environmentalists \u2014 they just threatened to sue, and it inflicted paralysis on the entire process. Didn\u2019t cost a dime.\n\nMeanwhile, the cost of finishing I-526 goes up every day.\n\nWhich makes it harder to do. That\u2019s the second brilliant part of the strategy.\n\nRight now, the state Department of Transportation is reassessing the cost of the road \u2014 and it could end up topping $700 million, according to some estimates. That would be more expensive than the Ravenel Bridge.\n\nAnd as the price goes up, the state\u2019s commitment is dropping. Out of that $558 million the State Infrastructure Bank has agreed to spend, only about $420 million has been approved by the state Budget and Control Board.\n\nThe rest? Well, let\u2019s just say state officials are eyeing that money hungrily. It\u2019s not gone yet, but if we blink, we might miss it.\n\nOf course, if we do get cheated out of promised money, maybe we can convince all those new Lowcountry residents on Johns Island to bike into town.\n\nIf you believe that, Charleston County has a $700 million bridge to sell you.\n\nHalf better than none\n\nAs Limehouse points out, Savannah Highway, St. Andrew\u2019s Boulevard and Highway 61 are already mired in gridlock every day.\n\nThis is the price we pay for being a great place to live. We are now getting Florida\u2019s traffic as well as its weather.\n\nFinishing I-526 is not going to solve all those problems, but it would relieve a lot of pressure \u2014 pressure that is growing stronger every day, like it or not.\n\nWould it speed along the development of Johns Island? Sure, unless a certain government body restricted that growth. But as they used to say on the farm, that horse is already out of the barn.\n\nState DOT Chairman Jim Rozier \u2014 who, like Limehouse, is a member of the Infrastructure Bank board \u2014 says he thinks the road ought to be built. At least some of it.\n\n\u201cIf you can\u2019t do it all, do the part from Johns Island to Highway 17,\u201d Rozier says. \u201cI could support that.\u201d\n\nThat may be the only choice. As Rozier astutely points out, with costs rising every day, finishing I-526 is only going to get more difficult. Maybe building it in stages is the only play we have left.\n\nOr we could just continue to do nothing, and sit in traffic as the environmentalists bike by us in search of those last unspoiled remnants of what Johns Island once was.\n\nReach Brian Hicks at bhicks@postandcourier.com.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "I-526 may be slipping out of reach, Brian Hicks, \r\nBrian HicksFP LatestNews, \r\nMetro, \r\nMetro, Chip Limehouse,Interstate 526,Jim Rozier", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "If the nightmare of Johns Island traffic during our most recent flood didn\u2019t convince you I-526 needs to be finished, nothing will.", "title": "I-526 may be slipping out of reach", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20150913/150919881/i-526-may-be-slipping-out-of-reach", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150913/PC16/150919881/AR/0/AR-150919881.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150913/PC16/150919881/AR/0/AR-150919881.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "If the nightmare of Johns Island traffic during our most recent flood didn\u2019t convince you I-526 needs to be finished, nothing will.", "title": "I-526 may be slipping out of reach", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150913/PC16/150919881/AR/0/AR-150919881.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 150919881}}, "keywords": "I-526 may be slipping out of reach , Brian Hicks, \r\nBrian HicksFP LatestNews, \r\nMetro, \r\nMetro, Chip Limehouse,Interstate 526,Jim Rozier", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-13T06:00:00Z", "modified_time": "2015-09-11T16:38:00Z", "author": "Brian Hicks"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "If the nightmare of Johns Island traffic during our most recent flood didn\u2019t convince you I-526 needs to be finished, nothing will."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd39dc\"", "article_summary": "If the nightmare of Johns Island traffic during our most recent flood didn\u2019t convince you I-526 needs to be finished, nothing will.\nCars leaving Johns Island use the middle lane on Main Road between Highway 17 and the Limehouse bridge Sept. 2.\nAs Rozier astutely points out, with costs rising every day, finishing I-526 is only going to get more difficult.\nOf course, if we do get cheated out of promised money, maybe we can convince all those new Lowcountry residents on Johns Island to bike into town.\n\u201cIf you can\u2019t do it all, do the part from Johns Island to Highway 17,\u201d Rozier says."}
