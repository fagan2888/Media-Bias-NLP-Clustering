Further, Weinstein points out that so-called \"cadillac tax\" isn't reserved for expensive plans, but instead eventually hits all plans. The \"cadillac tax\" in Obamacare is not applied directly to the consumer but indirectly through the insurance companies. This way, the consumer blames insurance companies for increased costs instead of the government for a massive tax grab hidden in Obamacare.\n\n-Obamacare isn't a \"mess\" or a \"disaster\" of a bill, but rather a brilliant, well structured piece of legislation with very deliberate language and components.\n\nBe sure to watch the whole thing, it's well worth your time.\n\n\"I just wanted the American people to know what's going on,\" Weinsten said.\n\nEditor's note: The original version of this post stated Obamacare is a $250 billion tax grab. \"Per year\" should have included after the $250 billion figure.
