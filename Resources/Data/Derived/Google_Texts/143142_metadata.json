It\u2019s the desperation of a man who is still clinging to his reputation as the next big thing in Republican politics, even though it has been completely eroded away as the GOP has moved on to newer, fresher up-and-coming stars with far less political baggage. Jindal formed his presidential exploratory committee this week, and he\u2019ll come into the 2016 race with just over one percent of Republican primary voters backing his candidacy, putting him on the same level as dead-end candidates Carly Fiorina and Lindsey Graham. In his own deep-red state, Jindal\u2019s approval rating is abysmally low \u2013 lower than that of crummy socialist dictator Barack Obama. But he\u2019s still out there, trying to stir the pot and force people to remember the good old days of Bobby Jindal: Republican Savior.\n\nHis latest attention-grabbing move is an executive order to \u201cenforce the intent of a religious freedom bill\u201d that failed to make it out of the Louisiana legislature. You probably recall last month\u2019s conflagration over Indiana\u2019s \u201creligious freedom\u201d legislation that would have given businesses stronger legal protections to discriminate against gay customers. Jindal, ever eager to insert himself into roiling controversies, declared his support for the Indiana law and said he\u2019d push for Louisiana to pass its own \u201creligious freedom\u201d law which was substantially worse than the Hoosier State\u2019s version. Jindal\u2019s 2016 game plan seems to revolve around picking fights on cultural issues to endear himself to Christian conservatives, and a battle over gay rights fits nicely into that strategy.\n\nHe ran into a bit of a hiccup, though, when a Louisiana House committee voted overwhelmingly to effectively kill the \u201creligious freedom\u201d bill. Undeterred, Jindal issued his executive order. \u201cWe will be issuing an Executive Order shortly that will accomplish the intent of HB 707 to prevent the state from discriminating against persons or entities with deeply held religious beliefs that marriage is between one man and one woman,\u201d his office said in a statement.\n\nSo now Jindal, who pals around with some of the worst anti-gay bigots reality TV has to offer, can boast during the GOP primary debates that he single-handedly protected Louisiana\u2019s religious freedom from the threat posed by equal rights the dignified treatment gay people. But in doing so, he\u2019s exposed himself as something of a glaring hypocrite.\n\nConsider what Jindal did here. His state legislature refused to move forward on a piece of legislation that he considered crucial. So rather than respect the will of the elected representatives, Jindal cut them out of the loop and took unilateral action. If you\u2019ve been following the ongoing debate over immigration reform, then you\u2019ve probably heard some of the vicious attacks Republicans and conservatives have directed at Barack Obama for unilaterally imposing \u201camnesty\u201d by taking executive actions on deportations.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bobby Jindal, who blasts Obama for executive action on immigration, is unilaterally enforcing \"religious freedom\"", "title": "Jindal\u2019s desperate hypocrisy: By his own standard, Louisiana\u2019s governor is an arrogant, lawless cynic", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Bobby Jindal, who blasts Obama for executive action on immigration, is unilaterally enforcing \"religious freedom\"", "title": "Jindal\u2019s desperate hypocrisy: By his own standard, Louisiana\u2019s governor is an arrogant, lawless cynic", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/20/jindals_desperate_hypocrisy_by_his_own_standard_louisianas_governor_is_an_arrogant_lawless_cynic/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/bobby_jindal2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Bobby Jindal, who blasts Obama for executive action on immigration, is unilaterally enforcing \"religious freedom\"", "title": "Jindal\u2019s desperate hypocrisy: By his own standard, Louisiana\u2019s governor is an arrogant, lawless cynic", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/bobby_jindal2.jpg", "creator": "@SimonMaloy", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Simon Maloy", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2016 Elections, Bobby Jindal, Gay Rights, Immigration, Immigration Reform, lbgtq rights, Louisiana, Religious Freedom, Republican Primary", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: 2016 Elections, Bobby Jindal, Gay Rights, Immigration, Immigration Reform, lbgtq rights, Louisiana, Religious Freedom, Republican Primary, Politics NewsThere\u2019s a noticeable desperation surrounding Louisiana governor Bobby Jindal.\nBut he\u2019s still out there, trying to stir the pot and force people to remember the good old days of Bobby Jindal: Republican Savior.\nJindal\u2019s 2016 game plan seems to revolve around picking fights on cultural issues to endear himself to Christian conservatives, and a battle over gay rights fits nicely into that strategy.\nHe ran into a bit of a hiccup, though, when a Louisiana House committee voted overwhelmingly to effectively kill the \u201creligious freedom\u201d bill.\nYou probably recall last month\u2019s conflagration over Indiana\u2019s \u201creligious freedom\u201d legislation that would have given businesses stronger legal protections to discriminate against gay customers."}
