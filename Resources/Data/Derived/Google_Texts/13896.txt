As the flammable liquid tanker car derails at Pearl and 30th Street and rolls through the lobby of the new, smart-growth tower, thankfully, all residents safely evacuate. Just as the last bearded hipster squeezes through the exit without spilling his latte, a fire erupts.

The Boulder Fire Department is ready to roll, but, unfortunately, it's rush hour and the recent lane reductions combined with all the flashing crosswalks have caused perfect gridlock everywhere. Knowing that they can access water once on the scene, the can-do firemen commandeer several B-Cycles and pedal over to the calamity.

They quickly discover that the electric water pumps won't turn on because the muni hasn't installed those backup power circuits yet. The east county fire squads are called in, but, bummer drag, large potholes on the unmaintained county roads are causing unanticipated delays. Smoke can now be seen from the downtown treehouse where council members are playing rock-paper-scissors to decide on whom to train their high-powered bureaucracy cannon at next. Will it be insensitive trailer-park owners or hapless Boulder Creek rock stackers?

Over in Central Planning, the disaster has everyone reconsidering the wisdom of locating high-rise apartments on rail curves. During the press conference, the mayor states that the real disaster here is that the fire has thrown off Boulder's global warming calculations for the year, but, thankfully, the muni can easily compensate for it by shutting down residents' air conditioners for only a few weeks.

When asked how many expletives he gives about citizens who actually need to use their cars every day, the mayor responds by saying that traffic calming is fair punishment for anyone not having the proper ideology and that using the city's vast resources to antagonize drivers and businesses would still remain a top priority.
