Tip-off time is set for noon CT at the Hutchinson Sports Arena.\n\nThe six-day, single-elimination tournament will begin Monday, while Tuesday\u2019s EMCC-Ranger matchup will mark the final of eight opening-round contests. The entire national tournament will be streamed live on NJCAA TV (www.njcaatv.com). Additional information, including a complete bracket, tournament results and game statistics, will be available online at www.njcaabbtrny.org.\n\nEarning their first NJCAA tournament appearance since making four straight trips to Kansas from 2010-2013, first-year head coach Billy Begley\u2019s 20-8 EMCC Lions gained this year\u2019s national tournament berth as the zone qualifier from Region 23/District XV. East Mississippi dropped a heartbreaking 74-73 decision at the buzzer to fellow NJCAA tourney entry Northeast Mississippi in the championship game of the NJCAA Region 23 Tournament played at Mississippi College in Clinton.\n\nGuided by Billy Gillispie, former coach at Kentucky, Texas A&M, Texas Tech and UTEP, Ranger College made this year\u2019s 24-team field as one of four at-large teams. Making the school\u2019s first NJCAA tournament appearance in nearly 50 years, Ranger College earned its at-large invitation after falling to Odessa College, 71-65, in the championship game of the NJCAA Region V Tournament held in Brownwood, Texas. The Rangers enter the national tourney sporting a 28-5 overall record and were ranked No. 10 nationally in the final regular-season poll.\n\nThe winner of Tuesday\u2019s first-round game between No. 22 seed EMCC and 11th-seeded Ranger College will advance to meet sixth-seeded Eastern Florida State College in an 8 p.m. CT second-round contest Wednesday evening. Ranked fourth in the NJCAA\u2019s final regular-season poll, the 27-4 EFSC Titans are coached by Jeremy Shulman, who was an assistant coach at East Mississippi prior to leaving for Eastern Florida. Shulman preceded Begley as EMCC\u2019s assistant men\u2019s coach and was on the Lions\u2019 staff during their first of four consecutive NJCAA tournament appearances (2010-2013) under the guidance of former EMCC head man and current Tallahassee CC head coach Mark White.\n\nHaving reached the 20-win mark for the sixth time in the last seven years, this year\u2019s EMCC squad rebounded from a 0-2 start in MACJC North Division play to finish an even 6-6 in league play and earn the division\u2019s No. 4 seed in the MACJC State Tournament. After claiming an 80-73 quarterfinal-round win over reigning state champion Pearl River, the Lions dropped a 61-59 decision to eventual state champion Southwest Mississippi in the semifinals. The following week as the No. 7 seed in the NJCAA Region 23 Tournament, East Mississippi knocked off No. 2 seed Mississippi Gulf Coast, 89-83, and easily breezed by Southern-Shreveport, 95-60, before most recently losing the one-point heartbreaker at the buzzer to Northeast Mississippi in the region finals.\n\nFeaturing five sophomore starters, including four players averaging in double figures on the year, the EMCC Lions are led in scoring by all-region tournament selection Daniel Simmons (Biggersville), who averages 15.6 points per game and also tops the team with 61 made 3-pointers for the season. All-Region 23 forward Jahyde Gardiner, a Tennessee-Martin signee, is averaging 14.0 points and a team-best 7.3 rebounds per contest, while Boston College transfer Nat Dixon follows at 12.2 points an outing and has connected on 40 three-point attempts. West Point\u2019s Juan Davis Jr., who joined Simmons on the all-region tourney squad, averages a solid 11.8 points and 6.0 boards per contest in addition to leading the team in field-goal percentage (55.7%) and blocked shots (39).\n\nMeridian\u2019s J\u2019Vaughnte Harris dishes out a club-high 3.6 assists from his starting point guard position, while freshmen David McFarland (Raymond HS) and Anterio McKines (Quitman) contribute 6.3 and 5.7 points per game, respectively, off the EMCC bench.", "article_metadata": {"description": "EMCC Lions to meet Ranger College in Tuesday\u2019s opening round of NJCAA basketball tourney in Kansas", "language": "english", "author": "EMCC Media Relations", "og": {"url": "http://www.wtok.com/sports/headlines/EMCC-Lions-Meet-Ranger-College-In-NJCAA-Opening-Round-371882942.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/designimages/1417*315/NC11_WTOK_350x100+banner+copy.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "EMCC Lions to meet Ranger College in Tuesday\u2019s opening round of NJCAA basketball tourney in Kansas", "title": "EMCC Lions Meet Ranger College In NJCAA Opening Round"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.wtok.com", "description": "EMCC Lions to meet Ranger College in Tuesday\u2019s opening round of NJCAA basketball tourney in Kansas", "title": "EMCC Lions Meet Ranger College In NJCAA Opening Round", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/sports/headlines/EMCC-Lions-Meet-Ranger-College-In-NJCAA-Opening-Round-371882942.html", "image": "$cms.content.Thumbnail.url", "creator": "@newscenter11", "site": "@newscenter11", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "keywords": "EMCC Lions Meet Ranger College In NJCAA Opening Round", "google-site-verification": "M1YwZ85zoJ2ZNboZjzjADGJ9L53qqzbNOi6FLrtDw9U", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "EMCC Lions Meet Ranger College"}, "article_summary": "Making the school\u2019s first NJCAA tournament appearance in nearly 50 years, Ranger College earned its at-large invitation after falling to Odessa College, 71-65, in the championship game of the NJCAA Region V Tournament held in Brownwood, Texas.\n22 seed EMCC and 11th-seeded Ranger College will advance to meet sixth-seeded Eastern Florida State College in an 8 p.m. CT second-round contest Wednesday evening.\nEast Mississippi dropped a heartbreaking 74-73 decision at the buzzer to fellow NJCAA tourney entry Northeast Mississippi in the championship game of the NJCAA Region 23 Tournament played at Mississippi College in Clinton.\n7 seed in the NJCAA Region 23 Tournament, East Mississippi knocked off No.\nEarning their first NJCAA tournament appearance since making four straight trips to Kansas from 2010-2013, first-year head coach Billy Begley\u2019s 20-8 EMCC Lions gained this year\u2019s national tournament berth as the zone qualifier from Region 23/District XV."}
