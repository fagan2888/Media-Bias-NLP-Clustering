Sen. Ted Cruz’s latest campaign ad questions Donald Trump’s ability to replace lauded Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, whose death was announced on Saturday, with a like-minded conservative.

“Life, marriage, religious liberty, the Second Amendment — we’re just one Supreme Court justice away from losing them all,” the ad titled “Supreme Trust” said.

It goes on to show Trump declaring that he is “pro-choice in every respect” in an interview with the late Tim Russert that dates back to 1999.

Earlier Sunday, Trump attacked Cruz over his support of Justice John Roberts whose decisions kept Obamacare legal.

This shows what a complete & total liar Ted Cruz is- he said he wouldn’t have nominated John Roberts. Really? https://t.co/gBnsNgomom — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 14, 2016

Ted Cruz, along with Jeb Bush, pushed Justice John Roberts onto the Supreme Court. Roberts could have killed ObamaCare twice, but didn’t! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 14, 2016
