I don\u2019t think we need guns in this country, and I hate it, and I think the NRA is a disaster area\u2026 I shouldn\u2019t say this, but I\u2019ll tell it to you, Howard. I\u2019m going to make a movie with Meryl Streep, and we\u2019re going to take this head-on. And they\u2019re going to wish they weren\u2019t alive after I\u2019m done with them.\u201d\n\nWeinstein may not be aware that there are plenty of law-abiding gun owner or non-owners who aren\u2019t fans of the NRA either, yet are fans of the Second Amendment which protects the right of citizens to keep and bear arms.\n\nAccording to Mediate, the NRA actually should be sending Weinstein \u201cwho has glamorized gun violence on the big screen for decades\u201d chocolate and rose because his planned film \u201cwill only greatly enhance gun sales and NRA enrollment.\u201d\n\nIn a CNN interview that is due to air tonight, Weinstein supposedly vowed to not make any more movies glamorizing guns.\n\nAs a Hollywood mogul, Weinstein to date, however, has made millions from violent movies such as Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill, Django Unchained, and many other popular action films.\n\nMulti-millionaires like Weinstein and other entertainment celebrities also tend to live and work in low-crime, high-security areas and are often accompanied by bodyguards.\n\nWeinstein\u2019s campaign against the NRA may be roughly equivalent to the celebrities who are out there promoting Obamacare, even though they have lavish insurance coverage and the wealth to pay any out-of-pocket expenses such that they are insulated from the \u201cill\u201d effects of Obamacare.\n\nThe Five panelist Dana Perino likened Weinstein\u2019s hypocrisy to \u201ca pimp who thinks he\u2019s helping women in the workforce.\u201d\n\nAfter the horrific events in Newtown, Conn., a group of A-List celebrities filmed a public service announcement (\u201cdemand a plan to end gun violence\u201d) that was supposed to galvanize public sentiment in favor of more gun control, but most of the actors had appeared in shoot-em-up films.\n\nFollowing the Newtown tragedy, additional federal gun control legislation failed to gain traction in the US Senate, while gun sales apparently surged in 2013. New York and Connecticut enacted new gun regulations, but those measures aren\u2019t expected to have any effect on gun violence in the real world. Two state legislators who voted for Colorado gun restrictions were recalled, and a third quit to avoid a recall.\n\nAgain, you don\u2019t have to be a gun owner, a gun \u201cnut,\u201d or ever touched a gun or want a gun \u2013 and never even worn a camouflage vest for that matter \u2014 to believe that celebrities should avoid using their megaphone to intrude on constitutional rights, especially in this instance when their own content is \u201cweaponized.\u201d\n\nIronically, Weinstein has a future movie project about Jews who used guns to defend themselves against the Nazis during the Holocaust. The Washington Times noted that \u201cMr. Weinstein does not seem to know that the Nazis were able to confiscate the guns that the Jewish people owned based on Germany\u2019s government registry.\u201d\n\nCriminal Minds star Joe Mantegna has a different view on guns than Harvey Weinstein: \u201cIt\u2019s part of our culture our entire existence, without firearms we wouldn\u2019t have won the Revolutionary War, we wouldn\u2019t even have this country, or a lot of other countries wouldn\u2019t exist. You have to separate the fear people have that is unjustified, based on a word or news article, people have misused firearms throughout history, this is one instance that turns people off.\u201d\n\nAdded Mantegna: \u201cI find it amusing sometimes, the people with the most negative feelings [about guns] and then something happens, a negative situation or crisis and all the sudden, say if someone rattles their doorknob at night, I get a call the next day saying \u2018you gotta get me a gun.\u2019 \u201d\n\nSetting aside whether the NRA is a good or bad organization, the American public obviously wants an end to gun violence and criminality and generally would support reasonable measures in that regard provided they don\u2019t serve to disarm law-abiding citizens.\n\nDo you think Harvey Weinstein\u2019s anti-NRA movie will change anyone\u2019s mind on guns?\n\n[top image credit: David Shankbone]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Is anti-gun movie producer Harvey Weinstein a hypocrite when it comes to his opposition to the National Rifle Association?
