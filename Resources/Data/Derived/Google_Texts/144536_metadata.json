Chesloff, executive director of the Massachusetts Business Roundtable (MBR), which represents the Commonwealth\u2019s largest employers. \u201cThey often refer to it as \u2018the cost of doing government.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe same sentiment is echoed by many of the small and medium-sized companies doing business here, according to Chris Geehern, executive vice president for marketing at Associated Industries of Massachusetts (AIM). \u201cThe administrative burdens of both state and federal business regulations are substantial, and the financial load falls disproportionately on smaller companies,\u201d he said.\n\nThere are signs that those business voices are now being heard, at least on the state level.\n\nA comprehensive review of all executive branch regulations, initiated by the Baker administration last spring, will be formally completed by the end of March, said Administration & Finance Undersecretary Rachel Madden. The goal is to make Massachusetts a more efficient and competitive place to live and work and to drive economic growth.\n\n\u201cWe are nine months into the official review and our various Secretariats have held more than 120 listening sessions across the Commonwealth,\u201d said Madden. \u201cWhile each regulation will be formally reviewed by March 31, 2016, we look forward to continuing the conversation about state regulations with businesses, local officials and individuals in the months and years to come.\n\n\u201cReviewing state regulations is something we believe should be done on an ongoing basis,\u201d she added.\n\nChesloff said national surveys conducted by publications such as CEO and CFO magazines consistently rate Massachusetts very low on the basis of regulation and taxation.\n\n\u201cBusinesses today operate in a global economy, where companies have opportunities to expand in other states or other countries,\u201d Chesloff added. \u201cThat is why it is so refreshing to see the Commonwealth\u2019s business and political leaderships coming together and agreeing that Massachusetts needs a tax and regulatory environment that is competitive in order to ensure a stable local economy that can grow jobs and promote prosperity for all.\u201d\n\nSeeking \u2018Smart Partnerships\u2019\n\nMBR and AIM both have been encouraging regulators and employers to adopt \u201csmart partnerships\u201d to ensure that government-business interactions solve problems instead of propping up bureaucracies.\n\n\u201cThe regulatory environment can be complex and confusing,\u201d noted Chesloff. \u201cOur position is not anti-regulation, but rather one that seeks to address our members\u2019 desire for an even, consistent, predictable regulatory environment.\u201d\n\nFrom the perspective of MBR\u2019s larger employers, the two biggest regulatory concerns in Massachusetts revolve around revenue taxation and the environment.\n\nThe regulations surrounding combined revenue reporting, as promulgated by state law in 2008, are a concern, said Chesloff. In particular, there is some confusion around what businesses feel is a broader interpretation of the \u201cwater\u2019s edge\u201d tax implications than what may have been intended by the legislation. The water\u2019s edge provision excludes the income multinational companies book to foreign affiliates when calculating their taxable income. Many businesses feel that the methods regulators use to determine the portion of income that can be excluded under the water\u2019s edge provision aren\u2019t always consistent with the original spirit of the legislation.\n\nMany firms have the same concern in the environmental arena, feeling that regulations are more stringent than lawmakers intended when they were conceived. AIM, for example, on behalf of its base of small- to medium-sized businesses, has spoken out against a state proposal to regulate carbon emissions because it would likely increase what are already some of the highest costs in the nation for electricity and heating fuels.\n\nAmong the Commonwealth\u2019s financial institutions, the greater concern is with federal regulations, especially those imposed by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which created an additional regulatory infrastructure to oversee the already highly regulated financial industry.\n\nPaperwork abounds\n\nAIM\u2019s smaller-business members have their own regulatory concerns, according to Geehern.\n\nOne is the earned sick time law that came into effect last July. The new law affects businesses differently depending on their number of employees, but a common regulatory obligation is that employers file periodic reports that document their compliance with the law, which mandates that companies establish sick time policies.\n\n\u201cThe issues for many of our smaller members revolve around the complexities of the regulations and the additional costs associated with completing all the paperwork to document compliance. The administrative burdens are substantial,\u201d said Geehern.\n\nThe provisions of the federal Affordable Care Act are no less complex and no less burdensome.\n\n\u201cThere are multiple ways an employer might run afoul of this law and face substantial penalties,\u201d said Geehern. Those penalties also extend to non-compliance with the reporting requirements of the law, which, like the Commonwealth\u2019s earned sick time regulations, places additional administrative burdens on businesses.\n\nNew federal rules on overtime are also a concern. Changes to overtime regulations would expand the number of workers that are eligible for overtime compensation. The Department of Labor will announce the specifics of the new rules this coming July. When the regulations will go into effect is unknown, but \u201cthe potential effects on employers \u2013 especially in the retail sector \u2013 could be huge,\u201d said Geehern.\n\nDecember gifts\n\nOn the positive side, just last month, President Obama signed an omnibus tax and spending package in which certain business taxes were delayed. Among them were taxes on medical devices and so-called \u201cCadillac\u201d health care plans, both provisions of the Affordable Care Act. Whether these provisions will eventually be repealed is an open question, but for the short term, the delays should be helpful to many Massachusetts employers.\n\nThe medical device industry is a significant part of the Massachusetts economy. Analysts are concerned that additional taxation could slow down the industry and threaten its competitiveness across the global stage.\n\nDelay of the mandated tax on high-benefit health care plans will be helpful to many companies because the cost of health care in Massachusetts is significantly higher than in most other states.\n\n\u201cWe believe the Cadillac health care tax would be especially punitive for Massachusetts companies,\u201d said Geehern.\n\nIntensive national lobbying efforts to repeal both of these provisions of the Affordable Care Act are ongoing.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A leading news source for Massachusetts, breaking news, business, sports, health, arts & entertainment, politics, education, cars, jobs, real estate & more.", "og": {"url": "http://sponsored.bostonglobe.com/rocklandtrust/commonwealth-is-listening-to-business-concerns-about-regulation/", "image": "http://sponsored.bostonglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Screen-Shot-2015-12-30-at-4.13.37-PM.jpg", "type": "website", "title": "Commonwealth Is Listening to Business Concerns About Regulation"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 95431448, "card": "summary", "site": "BostonGlobe"}, "robots": "noarchive", "fb": {"admins": 507486035, "app_id": 103933749691726}, "googlebot-news": "noindex", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/globe"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "\u201cReviewing state regulations is something we believe should be done on an ongoing basis,\u201d she added.\n\u201cWe believe the Cadillac health care tax would be especially punitive for Massachusetts companies,\u201d said Geehern.\nChesloff, executive director of the Massachusetts Business Roundtable (MBR), which represents the Commonwealth\u2019s largest employers.\n\u201cThe administrative burdens of both state and federal business regulations are substantial, and the financial load falls disproportionately on smaller companies,\u201d he said.\nMassachusetts business leaders, historically frustrated by what they say are burdensome regulations, start 2016 with some cause for optimism that the climate may improve."}
