We would go to someone we knew, show it, get feedback, work on it.\"\n\nHe had three other guys helping him. They showed it to more and more friends, 5, 10, 20 until they wanted to demo it beyond people they knew.\n\nSo they signed up to give a \"nerdy session\" at a tech conference and thought maybe 30 people would show up, Hykes describes.\n\n\"We didn't think we were cool at all,\" Hykes laughs.\n\nThe session was something called a \"Lightenting Talk\" at a huge developer's conference called PyCon.\n\nIt turned out that Lightening Talks were a big deal at Pycon. \"But no one told me. I got up on stage and there were like 900 people there, it was the main track. I didn't have anything worthy to show. Just this little 'Hello World' thing. I was so nervous, I misspelled Hello World,\" he laughs.\n\nRelated: The Net Neutrality Debate Explained\n\n\"Inexplicably people went crazy, nuts over the demo. It got leaked on Hacker News. That was our launch. We did not plan any of this\n\nWhy Docker Scares VMware\n\nThe demo was for something called a \"container\" used to develop apps that run on cloud computing.\n\nThe cloud makes it easy for people to run their apps on all sorts of devices. But writing an app that can handle being moved around so much is really tough to do.\n\n\"If you are a software developer today, chances are you are not trying to build a desktop application, running in one computer at a time. You are probably involved in building something like Gmail or Uber, something that's just running out there on the internet, everywhere and nowhere,\" Hykes explains.\n\n\"You need your app to be running on many machines at the same time. As those machines come and go, the app has to evolve and expand to new machines and move around,\" he says.\n\nUntil Docker, everyone was coming up with their own ways to solve this problem.\n\nBut Docker wraps each piece of app into something called a container. You can change the container without changing the piece of an app. The container is smart enough to know where it (what kind of cloud server) and automatically adjust itself so all the parts of an app can float around the internet and still always work together.\n\nBefore Docker, the closest thing to a container was a tech dominated by VMware called a \"virtual machine\" (VM). VMware was founded in 1998, long before the mobile revolution, to solve a different problem. It tricks a single computer server into hosting lots of different apps, with different operating systems (like a Linux computer running a Windows app).\n\nDocker is disrupting that virtual machine tech, and threatening one of the kingpins in the enterprise tech world, VMware.\n\nVMware isn't waiting around for that to happen. In August, as container mania started taking hold, it got on the phone with Docker to strike up a partnership, Hykes says. The two companies are now working together to build a product that marries VMware's cloud tech with Docker.\n\nRelated: Startups Pitch a Brighter Future for Book Publishing\n\nBut there's still some risk that Docker could replace, not compliment.\n\nDocker just poached Marianna Tessel, one of VMware's most prestigious early engineers, from her long term position at VMware. She's now heading up Docker's engineering.\n\nIngenius Business Model\n\nDocker also has a really clever business model. It's an open source project, so it gives the software away for free. Most open source companies earn money by selling subscriptions to a special version of their product that comes with support, or special features and they charge for things like training.\n\nDocker is doing all that but it's doing something else, from the days when it was DotCloud. It's building a service that's a cross between a GitHub (which hosts software projects in the cloud) and an Amazon (which runs software in the cloud).\n\nThe part that makes Docker containers so smart is a cloud service running on Docker's own cloud. When developers use Docker for important apps, they pay Docker for this service. The more apps running Docker, the more money Docker makes.\n\n\"Think about Docker in two parts,\" he says, meaning the free software plus the cloud. \"Compare it to a smartphone. It's way less fun without a data network around it.\"\n\n$10 Million In VC funds And Jerry Yang\n\nAfter that presentation put Docker on the map, Hykes and his DotCloud cofounders pushed DotCloud aside and joined Ycombinator to build out Docker.\n\nSmart move. This year, Docker raised $55 million from several top tier VCs including super angel Ron Conway.\n\nRelated: Mark Cuban on How Obamacare Could Help Startups\n\nAnd things took off from there. Docker has been downloaded over 50 million times, it has spawned 128 user groups in 43 countries, there are over 700 developers voluntarily working on it, with 15,000 third-party projects on GitHub using Docker and some big names using it too, like eBay, Spotify, Cloudflare, Yandex, Cambridge Healthcare and Yelp.\n\nYahoo founder Jerry Yang also invested and joined Docker's board.\n\n\"He's a great guy. I remember being so impressed. Your talking to a billionaire that changed the internet. He's so approachable and talks to you about every day problems as a founder,\" Hykes describes.\n\nThe way things are going for Hykes and Docker, he's heading toward an internet-changing, super financially successful future of his own.\n\nThis article originally appeared in Business Insider.\n\nRead more at Business Insider:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "A tiny startup called Docker, which launched a mere 19 months ago and gives its softwa", "title": "A Startup You\u2019ve Never Heard of Is Changing the Internet", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/11/17/Startup-You-ve-Never-Heard-Changing-Internet", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/flickr_solomon_hykes_docker_dot_conferences.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/11/17/Startup-You-ve-Never-Heard-Changing-Internet", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/flickr_solomon_hykes_docker_dot_conferences.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "A tiny startup called Docker, which launched a mere 19 months ago and gives its softwa", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "The more apps running Docker, the more money Docker makes.\nA tiny startup called Docker, which launched a mere 19 months ago and gives its software away for free, has become a huge industry phenom.\nThe two companies are now working together to build a product that marries VMware's cloud tech with Docker.\nThe way things are going for Hykes and Docker, he's heading toward an internet-changing, super financially successful future of his own.\nThe part that makes Docker containers so smart is a cloud service running on Docker's own cloud."}
