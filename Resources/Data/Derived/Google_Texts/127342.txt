When: Super Bowl week in the Phoenix area, where Lynch and the NFC champion Seattle Seahawks will play the AFC champion New England Patriots in Super Bowl XLIX next Sunday.

What’s up: There are media obligations for Super Bowl players Monday through Thursday — the big one coming Tuesday at the US Airways Center, the Phoenix Suns’ arena. Lynch has been fined $100,000 for twice refusing to speak to the media the past two years. He also has been fined for obscene gestures and wearing the wrong shoes.

Background: Lynch, 28, grew up on the rough streets of Oakland, then stayed close to home by playing his college ball in Berkeley at California. Three former Cal running backs were named to the Pro Bowl, Baltimore’s Justin Forsett and Denver’s C.J. Anderson being the others. Lynch was a first-round pick, No. 12 overall, by Buffalo in the 2007 draft. When the Bills started 0-4 in 2010, they traded him to Seattle for fourth- and fifth-round picks.

Klis’ take: There are two bad boys playing in this Super Bowl. New England quarterback Tom Brady is one. Lynch is the other. When Patriots defensive tackle Vince Wilfork called Lynch the best back in the NFL, it got me to thinking. Usually, the “best back” argument is settled by who gains the most yards. But would you rather have Dallas’ DeMarco Murray, who fumbles, or Lynch, who is an automatic third-and-1 back, in the game? Lynch the power runner, Russell Wilson the option-running, erratic-throwing quarterback, and the Seahawks’ aggressive defense have dominated the otherwise pass-happy NFL the past two years. I’m not a fan of Lynch’s act. But that defiance helps make him a championship running back.
