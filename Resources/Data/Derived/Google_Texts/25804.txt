Investigators at the scene of Sunday afternoon's deadly shooting (Source: Tucson News Now)

The Tucson Police Department is investigating the city's second deadly shooting in a 24-hour period.

Officers responded to Sierra Vista Apartments near 1st Ave and Prince Road at approximately 3 p.m. Sunday, according to Sgt. Kim Bay.

She said the call was dispatched as shots fired, but first responders found a man with gunshot wounds in an apartment. Bay said officers provided first aid and CPR on the victim until he was rushed to the hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

At the time of this report, no suspect is in custody, according to Bay. She said detectives have multiple witnesses to interview, so the investigation will run long into the night.

Several neighbors at the complex said they've been concerned with crime in the area for several years. One long-time resident said the deadly shooting was a "last straw" for her and she's moving out after 17 years in the neighborhood.
