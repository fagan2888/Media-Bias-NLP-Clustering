This has left students in the health professions with enormous amounts of student debt and, perhaps even worse, has turned many others away from pursuing such fields all together.\n\nThis is not consistent with our nation\u2019s goals of increasing student degree attainment and filling much needed roles in the health professions. Projections show that we will need 124,000 more physicians, 157,000 more pharmacists and up to 1 million more nurses in the United States over the next 10 to 20 years, in part due to expanded coverage under the Affordable Care Act. Yet today, low-income students are discouraged from applying to medical, dental and other health programs because of high tuition and insufficient scholarship funds.\n\nOur elected and appointed policy makers in government, academia and business need to start paying attention. Our nation\u2019s health will increasingly suffer from this growing lack of health providers \u2014 and most certainly from a lack of health providers in communities of need.\n\nYou shouldn't have to come from a wealthy family (or be willing to tolerate a lifetime burden of debt or the deferral of buying a home and starting a family) to go into health care.\n\nAnd yet 60 percent of medical students, for example, hail from families with incomes in the top 20 percent of the nation. Meanwhile only 3 percent come from families with incomes in the lowest 20 percent. The prospect of having to borrow and incur debts of $150,000 to $250,000 to enter the profession causes many students to seek careers elsewhere.\n\nEven those students who do successfully navigate the rocky financial terrain of health professions programs graduate with intense financial pressure, which then distorts their professional career choices. It often leads them to choose high-paying, procedurally intense specialties such as anesthesia, dermatology and orthopedic surgery rather than a primary-care field such as family medicine, pediatrics or internal medicine.\n\nThe result of this dysfunctional system deprives our country of the health professionals needed, particularly in rural and inner-city areas, and in racial and ethnic minority communities. It also deprives us of diversity within the profession itself. According to an article in the New England Journal of Medicine, the cost of attending medical school is the No. 1 reason why minorities do not apply to medical school.\n\nThat comes through in the numbers: Blacks make up less than 6.1 percent of medical students and Latinos make up 8.5 percent.\n\nThis unfortunate scenario did not exist before 1975. Up until then, a variety of scholarships and other financial aid mechanisms were available to students, including service-contingent loan programs. Federal Policy makers then made a calculated decision to move away from these scholarship models. They posited that all those with medical degrees would have high earning potential and should therefore be in a position to repay loans without any problem. It hasn\u2019t worked out that way for most young physicians, and now our country is feeling the negative impact of those earlier policy calls.\n\nWe could begin to address the problem of high student debt burdens by re-establishing such programs and having them focus on primary care \u2014 including pediatrics, family medicine, obstetrics/gynecology and internal medicine \u2014 as well as focusing on rural and low-income urban settings.\n\nIf we broadly implemented such changes, we would increase opportunities for students from poor and minority families to enter health care, and the development of their talents would strengthen our nation\u2019s ability to meet its rising medical needs. It would also have a great side effect: the democratization of educational opportunity as our society becomes more diverse, racially and ethnically.\n\nDr. Louis W.
