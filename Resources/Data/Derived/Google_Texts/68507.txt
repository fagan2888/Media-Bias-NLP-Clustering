Shoppers in the Philadelphia Walmart had a scare when someone called in a bomb threat just before 1 p.m. Friday.

Walmart called police and immediately evacuated the entire store for about an hour. Philadelphia Police Chief Grant Myers says the caller claimed that a bomb was in the building. His police, the Philadelphia Fire Dept. and Walmart management did a sweep of the building, in which they didn't find any evidence of a bomb.

Chief Myers says they believe the threat was a hoax. Investigators are working with Walmart to find a phone number for the caller.
