BOYD COUNTY, Ky. (WSAZ) -- Stores across our region have been busy this Black Friday as shoppers scour the shelves for good deals.

While people are shopping, stores are also beefing up security to keep things safe and organized.

Police said they aren't just helping inside the stores either.

At stores across the country, people have waited in line, ran, and even fought for good deals.

Shoppers like Rejeanne Duvall waited until Friday evening to get what she wanted.

"Usually in the morning, for the crowds coming in, you would see a lot of people with the needing more security," Duvall said.

Her plan was simple: avoid the chaos.

Duvall said she didn't see anything out of control while finishing up her Christmas shopping.

Boyd County Sheriff's deputies hope to keep it that way.

They stepped up extra patrols near many stores, including Walmart in Ashland.

They said their priority is to deter shoplifters and thieves.

They also want to keep crowds under control.

Along with Ashland Police and other private security, we're told at least eight Boyd County deputies helped provide security at Walmart when the doors opened Thanksgiving Day.

"We have felt good about that," said Lillie Burton, another shopper.

Deputies also said they watch parking lots, where crooks wait for people to leave something valuable in sight.

Burton said they've been shopping smart, being careful from store to store.

"We've had great luck finding parking spots up close," Burton said.

This shopping season appears to have been relatively quiet, deputies said there have been no major problems so far.

In addition to the patrols at the stores, the Boyd County Sheriff's Office also said they'll have extra foot patrols throughout the area to make sure crooks know they're watching.

We're also told the patrols aren't over after Black Friday, officers will also be out and about throughout the Christmas shopping season.
