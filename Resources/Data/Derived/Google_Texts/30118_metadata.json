Louie Gohmert of Tyler as among a couple dozen \"unhinged\" House Republicans keeping the government from being funded unless the Obamacare law is unplugged.\n\nCollins wrote that this cast includes Gohmert, who had an \"exciting time\" with Republican Reps.

Gohmert compared the current general-in-charge, Abdul-Fattah el-Sisi, to George Washington.\"\n\nBy email, Collins\u2019 research aide, Isabella Moschen, pointed us to a New York Times news article posted online Sept. 8, 2013, describing a Cairo news conference featuring Bachmann, King and Gohmert.\n\nThe Times story said Gohmert \"compared the leader of the military takeover, Gen. Abdul-Fattah el-Sisi, to George Washington.\"\n\nThe visiting Americans vowed to defend the $1.3 billion in annual American military aid to Egypt, according to the story, so its army could continue its fight against what Gohmert called \"the bloodthirsty Muslim brothers.\"\n\n\"Stand strong, Egypt,\" Gohmert was quoted as saying. \"Stand firm.\"\n\nWe checked Gohmert\u2019s wording by watching a 15-minute YouTube video of part of the press conference. Here\u2019s the relevant quote by Gohmert from the video: \"George Washington, doing what no one had ever done before him, led a military in revolution, won the revolution and then resigned and went home. No one had ever done that. And we met in Gen. el-Sisi, a man who\u2019s the leader of the military, who might have a shot at being elected president, but who\u2019s more concerned about giving his life to help his country, Egypt.\"\n\nSo, Gohmert did liken el-Sisi\u2019s situation to that of Washington after his Revolutionary War victory.\n\nOur ruling\n\nCollins said Gohmert compared the current general-in-charge in Egypt to George Washington.\n\nGohmert linked the Egyptian general and Washington. But this statement could benefit from the clarification that Gohmert\u2019s comparison was limited to each figure\u2019s desire to put his country ahead of himself; he did not compare other aspects of their characters or achievements.\n\nWe rate this claim, which would have benefited from clarification, as Mostly True.\n\nMOSTLY TRUE \u2013 The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In her Oct. 3, 2013, opinion column, Gail Collins of the New York Times referred to U.S. Rep.
