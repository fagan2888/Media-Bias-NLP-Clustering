Maria Cantwell and Patty Murray, D-Wash., used the day to promote legislation called the Paycheck Fairness Act, which would strengthen the half-century-old Equal Pay Act with such provisions as preventing retaliation against women who seek data on pay levels for themselves and male coworkers.\n\n\u201cI want young women growing up today to know this is not an issue they are going to have to deal with in the future,\u201d Cantwell said. \u201cThey are going to get equal pay.\u201d\n\nBut a fellow Washington lawmaker, Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wash., headlined a Republican news conference at which she urged Democrats to \u201cstop politicizing women.\u201d She argued that American women have unprecedented clout in the workforce.\n\n\u201cOn this year\u2019s Equal Pay Day, I want to celebrate and highlight the important role that women are playing in our economy,\u201d said McMorris Rodgers. \u201cWhen you look at the fact that 47 percent of the workforce now are women, that they make most of America\u2019s consumer spending decisions, two out of three small businesses right now are being started by women.\n\n\u201cThey are a majority of our health care workers as well as 85 percent of health care decisions are made by women.\u201d\n\nMcMorris Rodgers is chairwoman of the House Republican Caucus, which is charged with giving members advice on such issues as how to counter Democrats\u2019 arguments that the GOP is waging a \u201cwar on women.\u201d\n\nRep. Lynn Jenkins, R-Kansas, Republican caucus vice chairman, delivered a sharper partisan bite.\n\n\u201cMany ladies I know feel like they are being used as pawns, and find it condescending (that) Democrats are trying to use this issue as a political distraction for the failures of their economic policies,\u201d Jenkins said.\n\nWomen \u2014 and particularly working women \u2014 have become a bulwark of the Democratic Party. They have twice put President Obama in the White House.\n\nBut they are less likely to vote in mid-term elections, which helped prompt events Tuesday, including a speech by President Obama at the White House.\n\nAlluding to women being paid only 77 percent of what men earn, Obama stated: \u201cIn 2014, that\u2019s an embarrassment.\u201d\n\nCantwell argued, in a Senate floor speech, that whatever the politics, basic issues of social justice and family security are at stake.\n\n\u201cFrom around the age of 35, through retirement, women are typically paid about 75-80 percent of what men are paid,\u201d Cantwell said. \u201cOver her lifetime, a woman in Washington will earn $500,000 less than her male counterparts.\n\n\u201cRight now, one-third of families headed by a woman in Washington state live in poverty. Closing the wage gap means women in Washington would be able to afford 82 more weeks of food, according to figures from the Partnership of Women and Families.\u201d\n\nNearly every release from McMorris Rodgers\u2019 office headlines that she is \u201cdefending\u201d Eastern Washington farmers or businesses against such programs as the Affordable Care Act and President Obama\u2019s 30-hour order on overtime pay.\n\nBut some argue that McMorris Rodgers ought to take a long, critical look at her Eastern Washington district before trimming the social safety net.\n\nThe 5th Congressional District is below the national average in pay. Stevens County, McMorris Rodgers\u2019 official home, has an unemployment rate higher than the national average. One in six persons lives below the poverty level, and one in five is on food stamps.\n\nCould it possibly be that some of these people are women who are underpaid compared with their male counterparts?", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Strange Bedfellows -- Politics News", "description": "Women in America\u2019s work force earn on the average 77 cents for every dollar paid to their male counterparts, with African-American women and Latinas lagging further behind, which prompted the\u2026", "title": "\u2018Equal Pay Day\u2019 divides Washington women in Congress", "url": "http://blog.seattlepi.com/seattlepolitics/2014/04/08/equal-pay-day-divides-washington-women-in-congress/", "image": "http://blog.seattlepi.com/seattlepolitics/wp-content/blogs.dir/838/files/2013/02/GettyImages_160764484-300x199.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-04-09T01:14:55+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-04-09T01:35:02+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary"}, "NextGEN": "1.7.5", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd90fe\"", "article_summary": "\u201cOn this year\u2019s Equal Pay Day, I want to celebrate and highlight the important role that women are playing in our economy,\u201d said McMorris Rodgers.\nStevens County, McMorris Rodgers\u2019 official home, has an unemployment rate higher than the national average.\nWomen in America\u2019s work force earn on the average 77 cents for every dollar paid to their male counterparts, with African-American women and Latinas lagging further behind, which prompted the White House and Democrats in Congress to proclaim Tuesday as \u201cEqual Pay Day\u201d in Washington, D.C.Sens.\nBut some argue that McMorris Rodgers ought to take a long, critical look at her Eastern Washington district before trimming the social safety net.\nMaria Cantwell and Patty Murray, D-Wash., used the day to promote legislation called the Paycheck Fairness Act, which would strengthen the half-century-old Equal Pay Act with such provisions as preventing retaliation against women who seek data on pay levels for themselves and male coworkers."}
