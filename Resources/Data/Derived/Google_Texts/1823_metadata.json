She was a blonde East German would-be rock star, a divorced army wife \u2014 and a survivor of a botched sex-change operation. And it didn\u2019t take long after the tough, down-on-her-luck persona of Hedwig first took the stage at a club called Squeezebox for writer/performer John Cameron Mitchell and composer Stephen Trask to create a trailblazing musical based on her life \u2014 and for her to emerge as a cult icon. Though it was far from an instant hit, \u201cHedwig and the Angry\u201d eventually became a downtown theater sensation and an acclaimed 2001 film, and its bold mix of rock and roll and unconventional themes helped move American musical theater in an expansive and truly exciting new direction.\n\nYet as beloved as \u201cHedwig\u201d has been, it\u2019s also long held on to a certain cherished outsider status. If you watch the story of the show\u2019s development on the DVD of the film version, you can\u2019t help noticing how many of its creators and fans position it in contrast to the Broadway fare uptown. But that all changed this year, when Neil Patrick Harris stepped into Hedwig\u2019s high heels, and the show became an instant blockbuster and garnered a heady eight Tony nominations. Salon recently spoke to the show\u2019s composer Stephen Trask about the classic he created \u2014 and the other musicals that never were.\n\nTell us a little about where you were when Hedwig first came about.\n\nI felt like John [Cameron Mitchell] and I were both at that time in the same spot. John was a 30 year-old actor and still being sent out on jobs to play 15 year-olds. I spent my 31st birthday asking people if they wanted cinnamon or cocoa on their cappuccinos. And then when we were going to do Hedwig, I told myself something needed to break or I was going to do something else with my life. I had a deadline \u2014 and I just squeaked by.\n\nWe did not know this was going to be this successful. But we all knew this was a once-in-a-lifetime thing that doesn\u2019t happen every day. We\u2019d finish workdays and nobody would want to say goodbye, so we\u2019d go have dinner together. We knew \u2014 this is real and it\u2019s deep and we\u2019ll all probably never have something quite like this again. We didn\u2019t know how people would respond to it, and when we opened at the Jane Street, we were doing so badly. But someone said to me on opening night, \u201cEven if this closes next week, which it might, it will go down in theater history.\u201d\n\nAfter the original off-Broadway success of Hedwig, you didn\u2019t go the conventional musical theater path.\n\nAfter Hedwig, I did get offered a couple of things I turned down, much to my manager\u2019s chagrin. I briefly worked on some things and walked away from them, like a musical about Harvey Milk, and I was pursuing movie scores. I did write multiple drafts with many partners on a musical based on \u201cClueless.\u201d I did that for four years. I wrote music for a musical based on \u201cRomy and Michele\u2019s High School Reunion.\u201d I was doing a musical based on \u201cThe Blue Angel.\u201d I\u2019ve written so many songs and worked so hard on adapting things. I\u2019ve written like 80 songs in the last fourteen years. I\u2019ve made movies and written and recorded for orchestras and have been producing records for bands. But if you write a song that\u2019s supposed to go in Act 2 of a \u201cClueless\u201d musical and it\u2019s built around that \u2014 it doesn\u2019t matter how fun and sing-able it is. Cher\u2019s night out with the Rat Pack guy, or my song about how Romy and Michele realize their lives suck, once you don\u2019t have the musical, it makes no sense at all.\n\nHedwig\u2019s never been off the radar since its inception, but how did the revival come about? It\u2019s interesting to see how this show that seemed at first like the opposite of a Broadway show is now a huge Broadway show.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Stephen Trask opens up about his Tony-nominated hit, his days as a barista, and the \"Clueless\" musical that wasn't", "title": "The \u201cHedwig\u201d composer\u2019s long road to Broadway", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Stephen Trask opens up about his Tony-nominated hit, his days as a barista, and the \"Clueless\" musical that wasn't", "title": "The \u201cHedwig\u201d composer\u2019s long road to Broadway", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/05/26/the_hedwig_composers_long_road_to_broadway/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/stephen_trask.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Stephen Trask opens up about his Tony-nominated hit, his days as a barista, and the \"Clueless\" musical that wasn't", "title": "The \u201cHedwig\u201d composer\u2019s long road to Broadway", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/stephen_trask.jpg", "creator": "@embeedub", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Mary Elizabeth Williams", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Broadway, Editor's Picks, Hedwig and the Angry Inch, John Cameron Mitchell, Neil Patrick Harris, Stephen Trask, Tony Awards", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Salon recently spoke to the show\u2019s composer Stephen Trask about the classic he created \u2014 and the other musicals that never were.\nI did write multiple drafts with many partners on a musical based on \u201cClueless.\u201d I did that for four years.\nYet as beloved as \u201cHedwig\u201d has been, it\u2019s also long held on to a certain cherished outsider status.\nIt\u2019s interesting to see how this show that seemed at first like the opposite of a Broadway show is now a huge Broadway show.\nTopics: Broadway, Editor's Picks, Hedwig and the Angry Inch, John Cameron Mitchell, Neil Patrick Harris, Stephen Trask, Tony Awards, Life News, Entertainment NewsTwenty years ago this summer, New York City got a new diva."}
