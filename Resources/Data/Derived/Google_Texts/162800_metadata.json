Specifically, Massachusetts launched a widely applauded state health exchange in late 2006, known as the Massachusetts Health Connector.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJon Kingsdale, a health exchanges and health care reform expert with Boston\u2019s Wakely Consulting Group, told International Business Times in a phone interview why federal and state health exchanges fared differently.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScale of Web traffic and complexity of IT systems were two key contrasts between state exchanges and the federal launch, said Kingsdale, who oversaw Massachusetts\u2019 health care exchange at its start.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Massachusetts exchange was set up to accomodate a maximum audience of about 6.4 million, or about 1/50th of the U.S.\u2019 300 million population at the time, noted Kingsdale. At its peak, months down the line, Massachusetts health exchange officials handled about 50,000 calls per month, whereas healthcare.gov has seen 19 million visitors since Oct 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe volume difference \u2013 the number of hits \u2013 is huge, and not unexpectedly so, given that they\u2019re covering 36 states,\u201d Kingsdale told IBTimes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother key difference is that Massachusetts did not have to build a separate system to determine eligibility for enrollees, he said. They used an existing Medicaid eligibility system, while the federal government had to forge and integrate a complex new system, using IRS income filings and income definitions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTight federal budgets were also a factor, as states received significant federal money to operate their exchanges, compared to a small budget appropriation for the federal exchange, according to Kingsdale. While individual states received tens and hundreds of millions of dollars, the entire budget for the federal exchange came to only $1 billion, he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201c$1 billion for 36 states completely dwarfs what each of the other states is getting for their own exchange,\u201d said Kingsdale. Oregon alone received more than $300 million, according to the Seattle Times.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMassachusetts also took a more patient approach, phasing in two distinct groups of enrollees over eight months, rather than launching all-out on day one. \u201cFolks have talked about that,\u201d said Kingdsdale. \u201cThe feds maybe jumped the gun on insisting on Oct. 1 for going live.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStates that have seen successful exchange launches within the past few weeks include Rhode Island, Connecticut, Kentucky and Washington.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStrained resources among the handful of health care IT specialists hired for this work could be another factor, said Kingsdale. As 14 states try to launch health exchanges at the same time, there may be too many tight deadlines for the few capable companies. \u201cClearly, some of the states have been able to do a better job than other states and the federally facilitated marketplace,\u201d said Kingsdale.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut what worries Kingsdale now is another uncertainty on the horizon that will come even after the Obama administration fixes all the technical problems discovered so far.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen they get everything fixed so that folks can enroll, then there\u2019s another set of [data] interactions with hundreds of [health plan] issuers and carriers around those 36 states,\u201d said Kingdsale.\u201cThousands and thousands of different premium rates and benefit plans and so forth, and communications links for those hundreds of insurers\u2026\u201d\n\nThe extent of the problem with the software code was highlighted over the weekend in a New York Times report that said 100 million lines of computer code will need to be rewritten as part of the website's fix.\n\nAccording to a software specialist cited in the Times article, the 500 million lines of computer code written for the Obamacare software is about five times longer than the average major bank's operating code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegarding potential problems over correct data transfer, correct billing, and accurate communication about federal subsidies, Kingsdale said: \u201cThat\u2019s a whole other set of tests and volume stresses that we haven\u2019t really seen, because of the bottleneck of the exchange itself.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWakely Consulting won a federal contract in 2010, with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to help conceptualize the health exchange, but it hasn\u2019t worked directly on the IT aspect of the federal marketplace. Kingsdale\u2019s team has worked on health care reform in more than a dozen states.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://s2.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "healthcare.gov, obamacare website, obamacare website news, health exchange massachussetts, health exchange ma, jon kingsdale health care expert, jon kingsdale wakely, healthcare reform, obamacare, us politics", "og": {"site_name": "International Business Times", "description": "Differences of scale, budget and system complexity may account for successful state health care launches and the flawed federal effort.", "title": "Obamacare's Website: Recipe For Disaster With 500 Million Lines Of Code, A Shoestring Budget And Political Pressure On Deadlines", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.com/obamacares-website-recipe-disaster-500-million-lines-code-shoestring-budget-political-1434496", "image": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2012/06/29/285033-us-health-care-policy.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Differences of scale, budget and system complexity may account for successful state health care launches and the flawed federal effort.", "title": "Obamacare's Website: Recipe For Disaster With 500 Million Lines Of Code, A Shoestring Budget And Political Pressure On Deadlines", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.com/obamacares-website-recipe-disaster-500-million-lines-code-shoestring-budget-political-1434496", "image": {"src": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2012/06/29/285033-us-health-care-policy.jpg", "identifier": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2012/06/29/285033-us-health-care-policy.jpg"}, "site": "@IBTimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "fb": {"app_id": 263851690471857, "pages": 128026713884051}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/IBTimes", "section": "Business", "published_time": "2013-10-21T14:42:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-05T00:31:07-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Differences of scale, budget and system complexity may account for successful state health care launches and the flawed federal effort."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7b94\"", "article_summary": "Specifically, Massachusetts launched a widely applauded state health exchange in late 2006, known as the Massachusetts Health Connector.\n\u201cThe volume difference \u2013 the number of hits \u2013 is huge, and not unexpectedly so, given that they\u2019re covering 36 states,\u201d Kingsdale told IBTimes.\nHealthcare.gov\u2019s problematic launch earlier this month has seen technical glitches for enrollees, flawed data for health insurers and increased scrutiny of private health care technology contractors.\nAt its peak, months down the line, Massachusetts health exchange officials handled about 50,000 calls per month, whereas healthcare.gov has seen 19 million visitors since Oct 1.\nStrained resources among the handful of health care IT specialists hired for this work could be another factor, said Kingsdale."}
