FORT PIERCE, Fla. (AP) — President Barack Obama kicked off the spring season on Saturday with a weekend golf getaway in Florida at the resort where he once caused a stir by playing with Tiger Woods.

During his stay at the Floridian National Golf Club in Palm City, less than 50 miles up the coast from Palm Beach, Obama planned to be out of public view, with no official events scheduled.

First lady Michelle Obama and daughters Malia and Sasha were not on the trip.

Two years ago, Obama played 18 holes at the Floridian with Woods and practiced with Woods’ former swing coach. This time, the president’s partners were expected to be a few friends who are his frequent golf guests.

Obama flew to the airport in Fort Pierce before making the short trip to Palm City.

Word of Obama’s golf game with Woods in 2013 came initially from a professional sports journalist who was on the course and tweeted about it, even though the White House had prohibited the traveling press corps from observing Obama on the course.
