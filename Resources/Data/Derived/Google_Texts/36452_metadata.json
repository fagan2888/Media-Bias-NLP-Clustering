Nonfunctional deliverables are items such as how long it takes a Web page to refresh after a user hits \u201center.\u201d\n\nSkowronski replaces Lindsey Tucker, who will continue to work for the Department of Vermont Health Access on policy issues, officials said, but her title and the exact nature of her new role were unclear Wednesday.\n\nThe state had already brought in David Martini from the Department of Finance and Management to lead Vermont Health Connect\u2019s day-to-day operations.\n\nThe IT management and day-to-day operations were both formerly Tucker\u2019s responsibility.\n\nSkowronski\u2019s hiring follows a pattern at the federal level of hiring private sector experts to help government get large-scale IT projects right.\n\nThe feds hired former Microsoft executive Jeffrey Zients to consult for healthcare.gov, and Google\u2019s Mikey Dickerson to help salvage the federal exchange when it was performing at its worst last winter.\n\nDickerson now has an expanded role examining and improving IT systems throughout the federal government.\n\nSkowronski, who moved to Vermont 20 years ago to work as director of data management for Blue Cross Blue Shield \u2014 the first time Vermont considered a single-payer program \u2014 said the job brings him \u201cfull circle.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like completing an unfinished chapter,\u201d to be part of health care reform in Vermont, he said.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "affordable care act, health care, lawrence miller, robert skowronski, vermont health connect, vermont, vermont news, vermont events, vermont press releases", "og": {"site_name": "VTDigger", "description": "A former project manager for UnitedHealthcare\u2019s Northeast regional leadership team, Robert Skowronski, will deal with the technical problems plaguing the state's health exchange.", "title": "State hires IT director for Vermont Health Connect", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Vermont-Health-Connect-feature.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-09-04T07:28:26+00:00", "url": "http://vtdigger.org/2014/09/03/state-hires-director-vermont-health-connect/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A former project manager for UnitedHealthcare\u2019s Northeast regional leadership team, Robert Skowronski, will deal with the technical problems plaguing the state's health exchange.", "creator": "@true_morgan", "image": "http://i1.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Vermont-Health-Connect-feature.jpg?fit=1024%2C690", "title": "State hires IT director for Vermont Health Connect", "site": "@vtdigger", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "keywords": "Vermont Health Connect, Lawrence Miller, health care exchange, Affordable Care Act, Robert Skowronski", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/vtdigger", "section": "Health Care", "tag": "Vermont Health Connect", "published_time": "2014-09-03T19:55:06+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-04T07:28:26+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc16f\"", "article_summary": "State officials have found the person they say will guide the IT components of Vermont Health Connect exchange to completion.\nThere is a lot that needs to be done to complete IT components of Vermont Health Connect.\nThe state had already brought in David Martini from the Department of Finance and Management to lead Vermont Health Connect\u2019s day-to-day operations.\n\u201cHe has a wonderful depth of experience with exchanges in other states,\u201d Chen said of Skowronski, \u201cHe wanted to come back to Vermont and we\u2019re glad to have him.\u201dSkowronski started work Tuesday in his new role as the Department of Vermont Health Access\u2019 interim-deputy commissioner for Vermont Health Connect.\nSkowronski had a general awareness of what was going on with Vermont Health Connect, but when he started paying closer attention, he was struck that the state had taken \u201cfalse steps\u201d similar to mistakes made in New York and elsewhere, he said."}
