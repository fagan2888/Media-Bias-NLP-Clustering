It does not need to obtain licensure for all strengths.\n\nSponsors may rely on comparative animal or clinical data using a non-US-licensed product to support an indication of biosimilarity. \"However, as a scientific matter, analytical studies and at least one clinical pharmacokinetic (PK) study and, if appropriate, at least one pharmacodynamic (PD) study, intended to support a demonstration of biosimilarity must include an adequate comparison of the proposed biosimilar product directly with the US-licensed reference product unless it can be scientifically justified that such a study is not needed,\" FDA added.\n\nQuality Considerations\n\nA second document explains the \"quality considerations\" companies need to take into account when attempting to demonstrate biosimilarity between a biosimilar product and its reference product.\n\nThe guidance can almost be summarized in a sentence, helpfully supplied by FDA on page six of the guidance document:\n\n\"Sponsors should use appropriate analytical methodology that has adequate sensitivity and specificity to detect and characterize differences between the proposed product and the reference product.\"\n\nIn plain terms: Because biosimilar products are always going to have minor differences relative to the products they reference, FDA is primarily concerned with understanding the effects those differences might have on the safety, efficacy, potency and quality of the biosimilar product.\n\nRegulators go on to explain in the guidance document that companies are required by law \"to include data supporting the analytical similarity of the proposed biosimilar product to the reference product.\" The rationale for the assessment should be \"clearly described\" in the submission, FDA added.\n\nThe guidance goes into great detail regarding the various quality factors sponsors should take into account when characterizing a biosimilar product.\n\nScientific Considerations\n\nFinally, the third guidance document explains FDA's recommended approach for demonstrating biosimilarity using scientific data.\n\n\"As set forth in the PHS Act, data derived from analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies are required to demonstrate biosimilarity unless FDA determines an element unnecessary,\" FDA explains in the guidance.\n\nSo what will it take it illustrate, scientifically, that a product is biosimilar to its reference product?\n\n\"As a scientific matter, analytical studies and at least one clinical PK study and, if appropriate, at least one PD study, intended to support a demonstration of biosimilarity for purposes of section 351(k) of the PHS Act must include an adequate comparison of the proposed biosimilar product directly with the U.S.-licensed reference product unless it can be scientifically justified that such a study is not needed,\" FDA wrote.\n\nFDA encourages sponsors to utilize what it calls a \"stepwise approach\" to demonstrate biosimilarity. \"At each step, the sponsor should evaluate the extent to which there is residual uncertainty about the biosimilarity of the proposed product and identify next steps to try to address that uncertainty,\" regulators explained.\n\nFDA said it will consider the \"totality of the evidence\" when assessing a sponsor's evidence of biosimilarity.\n\nAs with the second guidance document, the remainder of this guidance contains extensive information regarding how sponsors can use scientific methods to demonstrate biosimilarity.", "article_metadata": {"Keywords": "CDER, US, News, Submission and registration, Quality, Clinical, Biologics and biotechnology", "Description": "The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) today finalized  three long-sought guidance documents outlining its expectations for near-exact  copies of existing biological drugs known as biosimilars.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "Title": "After Three-Year Delay, FDA Finalizes Guidance Documents on Biosimilarity"}, "article_summary": "A biosimilar product may be approved for some of the strengths for which a reference product has obtained approval.\nThe guidance goes into great detail regarding the various quality factors sponsors should take into account when characterizing a biosimilar product.\nQuality ConsiderationsA second document explains the \"quality considerations\" companies need to take into account when attempting to demonstrate biosimilarity between a biosimilar product and its reference product.\nSo what will it take it illustrate, scientifically, that a product is biosimilar to its reference product?\nAs with the second guidance document, the remainder of this guidance contains extensive information regarding how sponsors can use scientific methods to demonstrate biosimilarity."}
