Richard Shelby told NPR before the vote that \"the value is to let him know \u2014 the president \u2014 and others that there's a big division in this country, and a lot of us don't like it, and the American people don't like it.\"\n\n\"It seems implausible that less than a week after a tragic shooting at the Planned Parenthood health center in Colorado Springs some in Washington chose politics over compassion,\" said Dawn Laguens, executive vice president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, according to NBC News.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said President Obama \"can't be shielded by the weighty decision he'll finally have to make when this measure lands right on his desk.\"\n\nLast week, three people at the Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado were shot dead by a gunman who expressed repugnance at the clinic's abortion practices. However, this did not deter the Republicans from pushing to defund the nation's biggest abortion service provider.\n\n\"Individuals who speak out for the life of children shouldn't suddenly be silenced by being screamed down because an insane person does a shooting in a clinic,\" said Republican Sen. James Lankford.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Dick Durbin said, \"So the fact that we blow off a day, two or three in the closing hours of this session for this political posturing, which is doomed to a presidential veto, is a waste of the time of the Senate.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "The US Senate voted 52-48 on Thursday to defund Planned Parenthood, less than a week after the attack at the abortion provider's clinic in Colorado.
