No offense, Spike Lee! Well, the President sat down with TNT basketball analyst, Charles Barkley, for a six minute interview that aired prior to the NBA All Star Game. The interview with the popular Barkley was a great way for the President to get his thoughts out and be seen by millions of younger Americans. Barkley and Obama discussed many topics that ranged from basketball to parenting, and the Affordable Care Act to gay rights.\n\nWhile Obama is a professed Chicago Bulls fan, he heaped high praise on LeBron James:\n\nYou know LeBron, I know LeBron. When you\u2019re standing next to him and then watch him close up, I\u2019ve never seen someone that size, that fast, who can jump that high, who\u2019s that strong, who has that much basketball savvy all in one package. Now, I\u2019m a Chicago guy, and Mike will always be the guy for me just because that was a magical moment for the city and he was a champion. But now that he\u2019s retired, LeBron, when you look at him, you think he might be able to play at a high level for another seven, eight, 10 years. He\u2019s 29 years old. In terms of every aspect of the game, LeBron has the chance to be as good as anyone.\n\nAs for his own hoops playing, Obama said that he does\u2019nt have nearly as much time as he\u2019d like to play, but also that as he is getting older, he is \u201ccreakier\u201d than he used to be:\n\nThese days, it\u2019s probably once a month. Things happen. One is that you just get a little older and creakier. The second thing is you\u2019ve got to start thinking about elbows\u2026and you break your nose right before the State of the Union address.\n\nRegarding his own daughters, President Obama says that he gets very excited to watch them play. And referring to Barkley, he stated that since he was a \u201cpretty good high school player\u201d his expectations weren\u2019t likely as high as Barkley\u2019s would be for his children.\n\nAt about the midway point in the interview, Obama and Barkley talked politics. Barkley asked the President if he likes the term \u201cObamacare\u201d:\n\nI like it. I don\u2019t mind. And I tell ya, five years from now, when everyone\u2019s saying, \u2018Man, I\u2019m sure glad we got healthcare,\u2019 there\u2019s going to be a whole bunch of people who don\u2019t call it Obamacare anymore because they don\u2019t want me to get the credit. You don\u2019t know what life will throw at you. Sometimes people don\u2019t recognize, particularly young people, how important it is to have coverage until you get sick and you realize you may lose everything you have, or your parents may lose everything they have trying to make you well. So we\u2019re encouraging people to sign up. They\u2019ve got until March 31 to sign up for this year.\n\nBarkley also asked Obama to touch on the issue of Michael Sam coming out as gay recently. (Sam is a defensive end for the University of Missouri and Co-Defensive Player of the year for the Southeast Conference). Obama felt that it was significant that Sam made his disclosure prior to the NFL draft, as it showed that he wanted to be judged on the merits in the draft. Obama went on to discuss the importance of other pioneers, such as Jackie Robinson (racial equality in baseball), and concluded this question by stating that America is stronger when \u201ceveryone is treated with respect and dignity\u201d regardless of race or sexual orientation.\n\nAfter conducting an this in-depth, sit-down interview with the current President, Barack Obama, Barkley\u2019s co-host, Kenny Smith teased that Barkley can no longer deny that he is a full fledged member of the media, no matter how much he\u2019d like to be known only as an ex-player.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Barack Obama is probably the most famous basketball fan in the world.
