According to the New York Times, the president is specifically looking to raise the top capital gains tax rate from 23.8 percent to 28 percent, and eliminate what he calls the \u201ctrust-fund loophole,\u201d which protects inherited assets.\n\nBeck said raising the capital gains tax will \u201ckill the economy,\u201d and said the government\u2019s attempt to take the money you have worked your entire life to leave to your children is \u201cwrong, it\u2019s obscene, it\u2019s theft.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the government\u2019s [money]!\u201d Beck said on his radio program. \u201cI\u2019ve already paid you my 50 percent. My children have a right to the money I want to leave them.\u201d\n\nBeck said taxes are already so high that if he wanted to leave his children his property, they would \u201cnot be able to afford the taxes.\u201d\n\nBeck\u2019s co-host Pat Gray added that it\u2019s not just the \u201cone percent\u201d who will be affected by the president\u2019s proposals. Aside from the impact on the economy, he noted that \u201cthere are a lot of middle class people who want to leave money to their kids.\u201d He also reiterated that it is \u201cnot the government\u2019s money\u201d to take.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a double tax at the very least,\u201d Gray said. \u201cOr triple tax. It\u2019s been taxed.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is so wrong. I can\u2019t take it anymore,\u201d Beck said. \u201cWho do these people think they are?\u201d\n\nStu Burguiere noted that the Obama administration is often compared to Robin Hood, but said the story was actually one of \u201cthe government stealing from the poor, [and Robin Hood] takes it back from the government.\u201d\n\nBeck was also infuriated by the number of Democrats who voted for Obamacare, who now say it should have been done differently.\n\n\u201cThese guys just hack me off. And what are the Republicans going to do?\u201d Beck demanded. \u201cPat immediately [said], \u2018Well the Republicans, they\u2019re going to stop this because they\u2019re Republicans. One thing they get right are taxes.\u2019 Is it? That used to be true. Is it true now? What are they doing to stop Obamacare? Did you see the penalties are much higher than they thought they would be? The costs of Obamacare to you personally, much higher. What have the Republicans done? Have they defunded it? They had the opportunity.\u201d\n\nBurguiere responded: \u201cThey are saying they will oppose Obama\u2019s [new taxation proposal]. How long that lasts, or what else they give up, or what version of it they decide to come to, who knows.\u201d\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nThe full episode of The Glenn Beck Program, along with many other live-streaming shows and thousands of hours of on-demand content, is available on just about any digital device.
