More than 90 percent of abortion took place during early stages of gestation, while women in their 20s accounted for the majority of abortions.\n\nIn 1990, there were 27.4 abortions per 1,000 women and 1.6 million abortions overall. By 2010 that number dropped to 16.7 abortion per 1,000 women or 1.1 million abortions, according to the report.\n\nThe CDC said the decline in abortions can partly be attributed an increased use of obtain birth control. The pregnancy rate has also fallen by 10 percent since 1976, while teen pregnancies also dropped by 67 percent.\n\nKathryn Kost, a researcher at the Guttmacher Institute who co-authored the report, told CBS News that many people are deciding to start families later and that both men and women are more effectively using contraception.\n\n\u201cAcross the states, the rate of unintended pregnancy is going down,\u201d she said. \u201cThat suggests that fewer women are getting pregnant when they don\u2019t want to. It\u2019s happening across the board, and affects the birth rate and the abortion rate.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A CDC report says abortions rates have dropped by a third since the 1970s, something experts attribute in part to birth control use and decisions to start a family later in life.", "pubdate": 20151213, "og": {"site_name": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "A CDC report says abortions rates have dropped by a third since the 1970s, something experts attribute in part to birth control use and decisions to start a family later in life.", "title": "Abortions drop by 35 percent since the 1970s, report says", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/RTR3IJ4F.jpg", "url": "http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/abortions-drop-by-35-percent-since-the-1970s-reports-says/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "A CDC report says abortions rates have dropped by a third since the 1970s, something experts attribute in part to birth control use and decisions to start a family later in life.", "title": "Abortions drop by 35 percent since the 1970s, report says", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/RTR3IJ4F.jpg", "creator": "@newshour", "site": "@newshour", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"app_id": 114150878604116}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newshour", "tag": "planned parenthood"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "abortion, birth control, CDC report, plan b, planned parenthood"}, "article_summary": "In 1990, there were 27.4 abortions per 1,000 women and 1.6 million abortions overall.\nBy 2010 that number dropped to 16.7 abortion per 1,000 women or 1.1 million abortions, according to the report.\nIt\u2019s happening across the board, and affects the birth rate and the abortion rate.\u201d\nIn 2012, 699,202 legal induced abortions were outlined to the CDC for women between 15 and 45, the report said.\nThe pregnancy rate has also fallen by 10 percent since 1976, while teen pregnancies also dropped by 67 percent."}
