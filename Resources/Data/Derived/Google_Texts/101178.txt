The U.S. Justice Department is suing the owners and operators of the Twin Oaks Mobile Home Park in Whitewater for refusing to allow families with children to live in certain areas of the park, the DOJ said in a news release Friday.

The lawsuit says the owner of the Twin Oaks Mobile Home Park Inc. and its managers — Merrill Eugene Gutzmer and Dennis Hansen — violated the Fair Housing Act by not allowing families to live in an area that encompasses about 60 of the 230 lots in the park.

The federal Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination in housing based on race, color, religion, national origin, sex, familial status and disability except in specified categories of housing reserved for older people. The park doesn't limit residency to older people, the news release said.

The managers refused to let a single mother with a 2-year-old child purchase the home, where the two planned to live, the suit says. The mobile homeowner and the mother filed a complaint with the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD.) After investigating, HUD referred the case to the Department of Justice.

"Many parents are already struggling to find affordable housing for their families, and they should not also have to face discrimination because they have children," said Molly Moran, acting assistant attorney general for the Civil Rights Division.

The lawsuit seeks a court order that would require the defendants to "bring their policies and practices into compliance with the Fair Housing Act" as well as monetary damages for seller and buyer of the mobile home and civil damages.

Anyone who feels they have been victims of housing discrimination can file a complaint with the U.S. Justice Department at (800) 896-7743, email fairhousing@usdoj.gov or contact HUD at (800) 669-9777 or through the agency's website at www.hud.gov.
