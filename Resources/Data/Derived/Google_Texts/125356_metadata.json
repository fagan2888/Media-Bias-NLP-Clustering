(Photo: Courtesy of Stacey Post)\n\nMy caucus day began at 3:30 a.m. Sounds excessive, I know. I can almost hear you: \u201cSlow down Stace, the caucus doesn\u2019t start until 7 p.m.\u201d But I had to be at the TODAY Show by 4:30 to start filming at 6 a.m.\n\nI soon found out Sarah Palin was there. I was trying to keep calm about former governor of Alaska and started looking around the room at the way they decorated the coffee shop and store.\n\nThey even had Sarah Pratt sculpt a small butter cow. So cute. As the show started, I realized that whenever Al Roker was on camera, so was I.\n\nMy favorite was the moment I realized how many famous people I was seeing at one time.\n\nAt 8:20 a.m., after a wonderful couple of hours, I had to get to class. In my 9:10 a.m. class, I gave a shameless caucus plug.\n\nI drove back to Des Moines around 11:30 a.m. to work the phones at the Republican Party of Iowa until 4 p.m. Time went really fast because I didn\u2019t put the phone down the whole time. So many people called, asking about their caucus locations and whether or not they needed to re-register or if they could bring their children. I loved answering them, as nerdy and lame as it sounds.\n\nAt 4 p.m., I drove back to Indianola (Simpson College) to drop off voter registration forms that we had students fill out, but were not in early enough to make the Secretary of State\u2019s list. I grabbed a quick dinner and drove back to Des Moines, finally to my own caucus location.\n\nI had been worried for weeks that I would report my two assigned precincts wrong and mess up the entire caucus. I had nightmares about being late and not being able to participate.\n\nAs we got settled and voted, I slowly went through the process of reporting my precinct and the other precinct in my area that was in the same building. I didn\u2019t mess up.\n\nIt\u2019s been an exhausting, amazing day. My first caucus was a success, and I am happy to be fortunate enough to participate. These last few months have really solidified why I love Iowa so much, as well as falling in love even more deeply with politics. I\u2019ve loved the entire experience.\n\nStacey Post is a sophomore at Simpson College, studying political science and applied philosophy.
