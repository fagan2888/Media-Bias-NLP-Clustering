Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) must really get Bill O'Reilly's Irish up.\n\nThe blustery talk show host has promised to move to Ireland if Sanders, who is running for president as a Democrat, gets elected.\n\nO'Reilly made the threat on Thursday's night's \"O'Reilly Factor\" after arguing that Sanders wants to \u201cdismantle\u201d Medicare and the Affordable Care Act \u201cin the sense that it would be Berniecare and it would be much more than it is now.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf Bernie Sanders gets elected president, I\u2019m fleeing,\" O'Reilly said. \"I\u2019m going to Ireland. And they already know it.\u201d\n\nO'Reilly went on to speculate that simply by making such a declaration, he might be handing a victory to Sanders.\n\n\u201cI shouldn\u2019t say it publicly because that will get Sanders more votes,\" he said. \"But I\u2019m not going to pay 90 percent of my income to that guy. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m not doing it.\u201d\n\nThreatening to leave the country if something doesn't go your way is a popular way for celebrities and non-celebrities alike to express their displeasure (and, occasionally, to shoulder their way into the news cycle for five seconds).\n\nOther famous folk who've made similar vows include Eddie Vedder, who said he'd move away if George W. Bush was elected in 2000, and Stephen Baldwin, who promised to leave in 2008 if Barack Obama was elected.\n\nSpoiler alert: They're still here. (In Vedder's case, technically you could argue that Bush didn't get elected in 2000.)\n\nAlec Baldwin reportedly said he'd move in 2000 if Bush was elected, but later denied making that statement.\n\nCurrently, Jon Stewart, Cher, Rosie O'Donnell and Samuel L. Jackson have all threatened to leave the country if Donald Trump becomes president.\n\nAlso on HuffPost:", "article_metadata": {"description": "K, bye.", "sailthru.expire_date": "2016-01-16 13:39:48 -0500", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "K, bye.", "title": "Bill O'Reilly Vows To Move To Ireland If Bernie Sanders Is Elected", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bill-oreilly-bernie-sanders_us_56992a35e4b0778f46f91dec", "image": "http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/56992c8a1f00005000216010.png?cache=a19caozydj", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "K, bye.", "creator": "@dmoyeweirdnews", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/56992c8a1f00005000216010.png?cache=a19caozydj", "height": 1000}, "title": "Bill O'Reilly Vows To Move To Ireland If Bernie Sanders Is Elected", "site": "@HuffPostMedia", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2016-01-15 13:39:48 -0500", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=us_56992a35e4b0778f46f91dec", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "media", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "Bill O'Reilly,Bernie Sanders,Eddie Vedder,George W Bush,Stephen Baldwin,Ireland,stately plump Buck Mulligan", "article": {"section": "Media", "tag": "Bill O'Reilly,Bernie Sanders,Eddie Vedder,George W Bush,Stephen Baldwin,Ireland,stately plump Buck Mulligan", "published_time": "2016-01-15 13:39:48 -0500", "modified_time": "2016-01-15 13:39:48 -0500", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/dmoye"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "article_summary": "O'Reilly made the threat on Thursday's night's \"O'Reilly Factor\" after arguing that Sanders wants to \u201cdismantle\u201d Medicare and the Affordable Care Act \u201cin the sense that it would be Berniecare and it would be much more than it is now.\u201d\u201cIf Bernie Sanders gets elected president, I\u2019m fleeing,\" O'Reilly said.\nThe blustery talk show host has promised to move to Ireland if Sanders, who is running for president as a Democrat, gets elected.\nAlec Baldwin reportedly said he'd move in 2000 if Bush was elected, but later denied making that statement.\nSen.
