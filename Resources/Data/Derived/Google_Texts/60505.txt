SANAA, Yemen â€” The Yemeni president has sacked the vice president and the head of the Cabinet, Khaled Bahah, citing shortcomings in the government's performance.

President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi appointed Ahmed Obaid bin Daghr to head the Cabinet and Maj. Gen. Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar as vice president, according to a statement aired Sunday on state-run media.

Hadi appointed Bahah as a presidential adviser, according to the statement.

Yemen, the Arab World's poorest nation, has been torn by conflict since 2014, when Shiite rebels known as Houthis and allied with a former president captured large swaths of the country, including the capital, Sanaa.

In March 2015, a Saudi-led military coalition launched airstrikes against the Houthis and later, a ground operation to retake back ground from the rebels.
