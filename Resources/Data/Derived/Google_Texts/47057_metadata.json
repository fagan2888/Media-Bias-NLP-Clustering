Acuff used her time to do some last-minute gift wrapping, grocery shopping and cooking for the holiday.\n\n\u201cI was so excited,\u201d Acuff said. \u201cIt\u2019s so busy in the gift shop, it\u2019s nice to have that extra day off.\u201d\n\nHer replacement, volunteer Bonnie Merenstein, has been helping out at the gift shop for years.\n\n\u201cI love to volunteer wherever it is needed,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen people work on holidays, it makes their lives more difficult. I\u2019m thrilled to do it.\u201d\n\nSome Jewish volunteers at the hospital helped kids in the lobby with arts and crafts, while others were dispatched to the play room on the eighth floor.\n\nOver at Project Angel Heart, the moment was not lost on Eric Lenderman, who was volunteering in the program for the first time.\n\n\u201cWe all take a lot of time to worry about our own lives and don\u2019t take the time to worry about other people,\u201d Lenderman said. \u201cI think I\u2019m guilty of that.\u201d\n\nAnd even though Jews do not celebrate Christmas, Seserman said this time of year is about giving to others, regardless of what faith you practice.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a really nice effort on behalf of the community to help each other and help those in need at the same time,\u201d he said. \u201cIt felt very Jewish.\u201d\n\nCarlos Illescas: 303-954-1175, cillescas@denverpost.com or @cillescasdp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Denver area Jewish volunteers help the needy on Christmas Eve", "title": "Denver area Jewish volunteers help the needy on Christmas Eve", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/12/24/denver-area-jewish-volunteers-help-the-needy-on-christmas-eve/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151224__CD25MITZVAH____CHM7649p1.jpg", "height": 430}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151224__CD25MITZVAH____CHM7649p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-24T13:58:19+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T20:35:51+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "One of the lucky ones to receive Christmas Eve off was Kim Acuff, an assistant manager at the gift shop at Children\u2019s Hospital Colorado.\n\u201cI think I\u2019m guilty of that.\u201dAnd even though Jews do not celebrate Christmas, Seserman said this time of year is about giving to others, regardless of what faith you practice.\n\u201cIt\u2019s so busy in the gift shop, it\u2019s nice to have that extra day off.\u201dHer replacement, volunteer Bonnie Merenstein, has been helping out at the gift shop for years.\nI\u2019m thrilled to do it.\u201dSome Jewish volunteers at the hospital helped kids in the lobby with arts and crafts, while others were dispatched to the play room on the eighth floor.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a really nice effort on behalf of the community to help each other and help those in need at the same time,\u201d he said."}
