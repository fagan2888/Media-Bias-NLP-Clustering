That brings the total to 21 states, according to the report. Those changes have been spurred in part by a shortage in primary care providers.\n\nOther states, such as Massachusetts, have chosen not to expand nurse practitioners\u2019 authority, amid concerns that they don\u2019t have enough training to do so. Some physicians\u2019 groups have argued that giving nurses too much responsibility could endanger patients.\n\nHigher degrees\n\nAnother goal laid out in 2010 was to boost nurses\u2019 level of education.\n\nNurses are getting on board: Enrollment in nursing baccalaureate programs increased substantially in the past five years. So did the number of registered nurses enrolling in Bachelor of Science nursing programs, which shot up nearly 70 percent between 2010 and 2014. In the same period, enrollment in Doctorate of Nursing Practice programs shot up by 161 percent. And enrollment in nursing PhD programs grew by 15 percent, to 5,290 students.\n\nThe surge in interest in higher education is encouraging, said Patricia Reid Ponte, president-elect of the American Nurses Credentialing Center. She was not involved in the report.\n\n\u201cOur biggest problem right now is people can\u2019t get into schools of nursing,\u201d said Reid Ponte, who also teaches doctorate-level nursing classes at two Boston colleges. \u201cThere\u2019s not space for them.\u201d\n\nWhile patients may benefit from better-trained nurses, the report also issued a warning: Hospitals now favor nurses with more education, which may lead to \u201cunintended consequences\u201d for \u201cthe employment, earning power, skills, and roles and responsibilities\u201d of nurses with less education.\n\nNational Nurses United, a union representing 185,000 registered nurses, raised precisely that concern. About half of registered nurses have baccalaureate degrees or higher; the Institute of Medicine aims to boost that to 80 percent by 2020.\n\n\u201cWe see this as eliminating opportunities for employment for communities of color,\u201d in which nurses often have only associate\u2019s degrees from publicly funded community colleges, said Bonnie Castillo, the union\u2019s nursing practice director. Already, some hospitals are turning those applicants away, she said.\n\nStill too white\n\nBlack and Latino representation in the nursing workforce has grown since 2001, but it remains low, the report found. African-Americans make up nearly 14 percent of people ages 20 to 40, but less than 11 percent of registered nurses. For Latinos, the gap is wider: Their share of that population segment is 20 percent, but they\u2019re less than 6 percent of registered nurses.\n\n\u201cMuch more needs to be done,\u201d said Stuart Altman, an economist at Brandeis University who chaired the committee that conducted the recent analysis. Altman said there was a particular need to recruit more Spanish-speaking nurses to communicate with patients.\n\nNurse leaders\n\nTo give nurses more voice in shaping policy, the 2010 report recommended giving them seats on hospital boards.\n\nThat didn\u2019t happen: The proportion of nurses on hospital boards actually fell from 6 percent to 5 percent from 2011 to 2014. Physician seats on boards held steady at 20 percent, according to a survey of 1,000 hospitals cited in the recent analysis.\n\nAltman and his co-authors said more research is needed on the number of nurses in c-suite jobs or in charge of government programs.\n\nInspired to change\n\nReid Ponte said when the 2010 report came out, it became \u201ca standard-bearing thing,\u201d and it was \u201calmost irresponsible not to pay attention to the recommendations.\u201d It prompted the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, where she serves as chief nursing officer, to examine its practices, including the makeup of its board.\n\n\u201cYou would think we would have had a nurse on the board here,\u201d said Reid Ponte. \u201cBut we didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nDana-Farber hunted for a nurse leader and put one on its board.\n\nThe report also inspired Dana-Farber to look hard at its workforce, where 94 percent of staff nurses are white, according to Reid Ponte. The hospital reinstated a nurse residency program, which hires newly licensed nurses and gives them 10 months of extra training and supervision. The program is small \u2014 just one nurse per year, growing to two next year \u2014 but Reid Ponte said it has begun to increase racial diversity.\n\nThe analysis released Friday was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, which also funded a campaign to implement the 2010 recommendations. Altman and his co-authors found there were too many changes in the health-care landscape, including the Affordable Care Act, to let them measure the impact of the foundation\u2019s campaign.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Nurses are signing up for higher degrees and gaining more independence in treating patients \u2014 but blacks and Latinos are still left out of the workforce.", "og": {"site_name": "STAT", "description": "Nurses are signing up for higher degrees and gaining more independence in treating patients \u2014 but blacks and Latinos are still left out of the workforce.", "title": "Step by step, nurses gaining sway over patient care", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1024, "identifier": "https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Nursing_BG-1024x576.jpg", "height": 576}, "updated_time": "2016-03-09T16:22:14-04:00", "url": "https://www.statnews.com/2015/12/04/nurses-patient-care/", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "origin-when-cross-origin", "twitter": {"description": "Nurses are signing up for higher degrees and gaining more independence in treating patients \u2014 but blacks and Latinos are still left out of the workforce.", "title": "Step by step, nurses gaining sway over patient care", "image": "https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Nursing_BG-1024x576.jpg", "creator": "@mmbaily", "site": "@statnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 933808010032702, "pages": 1456948254627841}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cropped-stat-logo-teal-270x270.png", "article": {"publisher": "http://facebook.com/statnews/", "section": "Health", "tag": "nurses", "published_time": "2015-12-04T11:00:52-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-09T16:22:14-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "dana-farber cancer institute, hospitals, nurses"}, "article_summary": "National Nurses United, a union representing 185,000 registered nurses, raised precisely that concern.\nAfrican-Americans make up nearly 14 percent of people ages 20 to 40, but less than 11 percent of registered nurses.\nFor Latinos, the gap is wider: Their share of that population segment is 20 percent, but they\u2019re less than 6 percent of registered nurses.\nThe surge in interest in higher education is encouraging, said Patricia Reid Ponte, president-elect of the American Nurses Credentialing Center.\nSo did the number of registered nurses enrolling in Bachelor of Science nursing programs, which shot up nearly 70 percent between 2010 and 2014."}
