Miller, the walk\u2019s founder and senior organizer.\n\nAIDS Walk Los Angeles was the world\u2019s first fundraising walk to benefit organizations dealing with AIDS. Since its inception in 1985, the walk has raised nearly $80 million, according to Ben Fordham, the walk\u2019s director of communications.\n\nLos Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti called walkers gathered in West Hollywood Park before the start of the walk \u201ca sea of angels in the City of Angels.\u201d\n\nThe Mayor also took time to make personal reflections about AIDS and HIV.\n\n\u201cI come here every year for my cousin Jimmy Hester, a proud out Latino who was one of the first taken in the AIDS crisis. I come here because of the friends who are living, celebrating and who are walking today because life and love surrounds us in this City of Angels,\u201d Garcetti said.\n\nMiller said the Affordable Care Act has allowed AIDS Project Los Angeles to enroll \u201cmany, many of its clients\u201d in health insurance for the first time.\n\n\u201cWe have the opportunity to get our HIV prevention clients \u2014 mostly HIV-negative gay men who\u2019ve never had access to health care before \u2014 get them in health care, provide them with medical screenings, HIV testing, STD screening and treatment, HIV prevention interventions,\u201d said Miller.\n\n\u201cWe really have an opportunity to change the curve of the epidemic,\u201d Miller added, \u201cAfrican-Americans are disproportionally impacted by the epidemic. The number one reason why is they don\u2019t have access to consistent health care. Now we can get them that access.\u201d\n\n\n\n(\u00a92014 CBS Local Media, a division of CBS Radio Inc.
