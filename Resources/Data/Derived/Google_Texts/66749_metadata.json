( Jessica Maher / Loveland Reporter-Herald )\n\nLarge airtankers used to fight wildfires have not yet arrived at the Fort Collins-Loveland Municipal Airport, but the new temporary base is ready for their arrival.\n\nThe U.S. Forest Service on Friday hosted a media tour of the operation, which was set up in mid-April in advance of wildfire season.\n\n\"With the past fire seasons we've had, we didn't want to take a chance of not having an operational air base,\" said Robby Cline, who is the airtanker base manager for the U.S. Forest Service.\n\nThe tankers, which have the capacity to carry up to 4,000 gallons of fire-retardant slurry, are usually based at the Rocky Mountain Metro Airport in Broomfield. But resurfacing of the main runway at that airport led to the need for a temporary relocation.\n\nThe Fort Collins-Loveland airport was selected because its runways are long enough to accommodate the tankers \u2014 and also because of its location.\n\n\"The difference between here and Broomfield is only 10 to 15 minutes,\" Cline said. \"We're looking for the rapid response.\"\n\nOther large airtanker bases are in Pueblo and Casper, Wyo.\n\nIn the event of a wildfire, airtankers will be loaded with the required load of retardant \u2014 which is mixed on site and stored in the same kind of tank used for fracking operations \u2014 and launch from the airport.\n\nDepending on the distance from the base to the fire, a typical airtanker usually completes four drops before needing to refuel. In some cases, airtankers will be in and out of the airport all day to load up with retardant and return to the fire, according to the Forest Service.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe airtankers will be deployed to wildfires across the Front Range.\n\nContact Reporter-Herald Staff Writer Jessica Maher at 970-669-5050 ext. 516 or maherj@reporter-herald.com.
