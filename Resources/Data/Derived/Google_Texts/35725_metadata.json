A Cambridge University study looked at 1,700 people with a genetic mutation that causes high levels of good cholesterol to get a better understanding of the protein.\n\nIt found that the group had an 80 percent increased risk of heart disease, which is about the same risk brought on by smoking.\n\nAll this isn't to say there couldn't be some health benefits to HDL. But researchers suggest past efforts have been trying to get those benefits the wrong way.\n\nThe Cambridge study instead says it might not be the overall levels of cholesterol that's important but the size of the particles and how good they are at transporting excess cholesterol to the liver.\n\nThe researchers suggest further study is needed into how good cholesterol interacts with the body, instead of focusing on the amount in the bloodstream.\n\nThis video includes images from Getty Images.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A recent study suggests that too much \"good\" cholesterol can lead to heart disease just like regular cholesterol.", "og": {"site_name": "Newsy", "description": "A recent study suggests that too much \"good\" cholesterol can lead to heart disease just like regular cholesterol.", "title": "New Research Says Even 'Good' Cholesterol Might Be Bad For You", "url": "http://www.newsy.com/videos/new-research-says-even-good-cholesterol-might-be-bad-for-you/", "image": "http://newsymain.npgroup.netdna-cdn.com/images/videos/m/1457703206.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A recent study suggests that too much \"good\" cholesterol can lead to heart disease just like regular cholesterol.", "title": "New Research Says Even 'Good' Cholesterol Might Be Bad For You", "url": "https://www.newsy.com/videos/new-research-says-even-good-cholesterol-might-be-bad-for-you/", "image": "https://newsymain-npgroup.netdna-ssl.com/images/videos/m/1457703206.jpg", "site": "@newsyvideos", "player": {"width": 400, "identifier": "https://player.ooyala.com/tframe.html?embedCode=x0ZWZ4MTE6qsAkV4yY7rhVdKWB67H46q&pbid=54ea1c2f14ee44369ddf31ac887ffe7e", "height": 225}, "app": {"url": {"ipad": "newsy://57952", "iphone": "newsy://57952", "googleplay": "com.newsy"}, "name": {"ipad": "Newsy: Video News", "iphone": "Newsy: Video News", "googleplay": "Newsy: Multisource Video News"}, "id": {"ipad": 330879884, "iphone": 330879884, "googleplay": "com.newsy"}}, "card": "player"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "newsy://57952", "app_store_id": 330879884, "app_name": "Newsy: Video News"}}, "msvalidate.01": "675C8D40A5F1E0722AA2D3A33379E884", "fb": {"app_id": 380870506022, "pages": 49978948774}, "google-site-verification": "o36fft0HATmhbZ_GPX4YSOS3EmkTGkPrvNFxQwzcNbY", "keywords": "cholesterol, good cholesterol, bad cholesterol, heart disease, heart problems, heart attacks, high density lipoprotein, low density lipoprotein, cambridge university, science, health, news, video", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newsyvideos"}, "thumbnail": "http://newsymain.npgroup.netdna-cdn.com/images/videos/m/1457703206.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Good cholesterol, or high-density lipoprotein, was previously believed to counteract the effects of so-called \"bad cholesterol\" and decrease the risk of heart disease.\nA recent study suggests that too much \"good\" cholesterol can lead to heart disease just like regular cholesterol.\nIt turns out what's referred to as \"good\" cholesterol might actually lead to a much greater risk of heart disease.\nThe researchers suggest further study is needed into how good cholesterol interacts with the body, instead of focusing on the amount in the bloodstream.\nA Cambridge University study looked at 1,700 people with a genetic mutation that causes high levels of good cholesterol to get a better understanding of the protein."}
