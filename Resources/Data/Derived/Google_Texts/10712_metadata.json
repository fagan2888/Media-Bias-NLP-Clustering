Always wanted your own medieval monastery in Tuscany? How about a palace in Provence?\n\nLuxury real estate in Europe has gotten a lot cheaper in recent months with the stronger dollar and rising inventories. While \"cheap\" is relative\u2014you still have to be rich to buy a castle\u2014brokers say prices for high-end properties across Europe for American buyers are down 25 to 40 percent from a year ago.\n\nThat's lured a new wave of U.S. buyers to Ireland, France, Spain and Italy. Mark Harvey, a partner at real estate firm Knight Frank who specializes in French residential sales, said the number of Americans looking and buying in France has tripled in recent years, and now accounts for 10 percent of Knight Frank's French sales.\n\n\"The interest is huge right now,\" he said. And the summer calendar is quickly filling with a showings schedule for American buyers, he added.\n\nRelated: Hamptons Billionaire Accused of Looting Company to Build Mansion Worth $248 Million\n\nTake, for instance, one of Knight Frank's listings in Provence\u2014a favorite vacation spot for Americans. It's an 18th century chateau in Carpentras that's been restored with modern amenities. It's got more than 16,000 square feet of living space, with seven bedrooms, a grand entrance hall, reception rooms, a dining room, kitchen, library and a master bedroom suite with a dressing room. It sits on more than 86 acres with two hunting pavilions, a guest house, outbuildings, an orangery, a swimming pool and a tennis court.\n\nThe property is listed for 11 million euros. At exchange rates a year ago, that would have been around $15 million. Today, that's about $11.7 million\u2014creating an effective price cut of more than $3 million.\n\nPrime property in Paris is now running around $2,000 per square foot, according to Harvey. Compare that $2,700 per square foot for prime property in Manhattan, according to estimates from Jonathan Miller of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel.\n\n\"Americans are looking at prices in Paris compared to New York, Miami or San Francisco and discovering it's a good value,\" Harvey said.\n\nRelated: Get Ready for Another Real Estate Bubble\n\nSotheby's has several listings in Paris that appeal to Americans looking for pied-a-terre, including a three bedroom in the 17th arrondissement that features high ceilings and great views for $1.7 million.\n\nThe currency drop isn't the only thing helping American buyers of European homes. With weaker economies and more of the wealthy moving to lower-tax countries, inventories for high-end real estate have been rising, and prices have been falling, throughout the region.\n\nIn Ireland, the Lisselan Estate in County Cork, a castle listed by Knight Frank, came on the market in June at 9 million euros. The price was cut to 6.95 million euros in December. Between the price reduction and currency change, the effective price cut was around $5 million.\n\nAnd it's not just castles and pieds-a-terre, many American companies and investors have been coming to Europe for deals on commercial real estate and other investments given the attractive values, Harvey said. Many of those Americans are now also looking at real estate investments for themselves, he said.\n\n\"You see many of them moving money out of U.S. equities and into euro equities,\" he said. \"When you look at the buying power of the dollar and expectations of a better economic cycle in Europe, real estate is a good play.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared in CNBC.\n\nRead more at CNBC\n\nWhy Did Bibi Win?
