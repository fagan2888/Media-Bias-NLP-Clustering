His lawyer, Carlos Warner, told Al Jazeera that Rahim describes himself on the site as \u201cdetained but ready to mingle.\u201d\n\nWhile Rahim can\u2019t check the account himself, his lawyer keeps him up to date on his \u201cwinks\u201d -- one of the ways an individual can signal to someone that they\u2019re interested in them on the site.\n\nRelated: Terrorist Attacks in France Complicate Closing Gitmo\n\nConsidered a \u201chigh-value\u201d detainee, Rahim is the last known prisoner sent to the facility, having arrived in March, 2008. U.S. officials believe he is a senior Al-Qaeda member who was once a close associate of Osama Bin Laden, but he has yet to be charged with a crime.\n\nAlthough he doesn\u2019t have an Ashley Madison account, Rahim has sympathy for those who had data exposed after the recent hack of the controversial dating and networking site. \u201cThis is terrible news about Ashley Madison \u2026 I\u2019ll stick with Match.com \u2013 even though you say it is for old people. There is no way I can get Tinder in here,\u201d Rahim wrote.\n\nRahim\u2019s letters don\u2019t revolve solely around dating and finding a mate. The detainee has also shared a number of opinions on politics and U.S. culture with his lawyer. Rahim reportedly has access to news articles, magazines and satellite television channels, which enables him to keep up with current events.\n\nOne letter reveals how he feels about the GOP front-runner for the 2016 presidential race: \u201cDonald Trump is an idiot!!! Sen. McAin is a war hero. Trump is a war zero.\u201d\n\nRelated: This Match Is Going Public\n\nHe also expressed enthusiasm for Caitlyn Jenner, who recently transitioned genders. \u201cI am happy for her because people are born how they are. I have one question though \u2013 how is she a republican? They want to take her rights away.\u201d Rahim also offered her a bit of beauty advice: \u201cTell her to use spray tan for her legs.\u201d\n\nAnd Rahim appears to be a fan of both basketball star LeBron James and pop singer Bret Michaels, though not of the city of Miami: \u201cIt is good to hear about LeBron coming home. Miami is a good place to visit \u2013 but nobody wants to Live there \u2013 too greasy and Hot. \u2026 as the great Bret Michaels once said \u2013 \u2018although the Wound heals, the scar Remains!!!\u2019\u201d\n\nOn a more serious note, Rahim questions how he can be held without charge and addresses his torture by U.S. officials, which was confirmed by a December 2014 Senate Intelligence Committee report: \u201cI am Innocent and I was Tortured. Hung from the ceiling until I was dead. I am not HIGH value They call me High value because the cia Tortured Me,\u201d Rahim wrote.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Match.com offers users an easy way to find love, but the online dating service doesn\u2019t", "title": "The Afghani Prisoner Looking for Love from Gitmo", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/09/14/Terrorist-Looking-Love-Gitmo", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/RTR3EU03.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/09/14/Terrorist-Looking-Love-Gitmo", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/RTR3EU03.jpg", "creator": "@milliedent", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Match.com offers users an easy way to find love, but the online dating service doesn\u2019t", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Related: Terrorist Attacks in France Complicate Closing GitmoConsidered a \u201chigh-value\u201d detainee, Rahim is the last known prisoner sent to the facility, having arrived in March, 2008.\nAl Jazeera recently released unclassified letters from a Guantanamo Bay prisoner, Muhammad Rahim al-Afghani, to his lawyer that reveal Rahim has a Match.com account.\nMatch.com offers users an easy way to find love, but the online dating service doesn\u2019t mention that a Bret Michaels-quoting Gitmo detainee is one of the potential love matches on its site.\nAlthough he doesn\u2019t have an Ashley Madison account, Rahim has sympathy for those who had data exposed after the recent hack of the controversial dating and networking site.\nI am not HIGH value They call me High value because the cia Tortured Me,\u201d Rahim wrote."}
