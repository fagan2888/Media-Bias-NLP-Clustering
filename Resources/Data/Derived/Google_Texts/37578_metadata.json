The center treats patients regardless of their ability to pay.\n\nThe work will more than triple the size of the existing facility at the corner of Clinton and West streets, said Marisa Manley, president of Healthcare Real Estate Advisors in New York. The project manager said she expects the new building will open next summer.\n\n\"Project H.O.P.E. is really looking forward to getting the new building up and looking forward to expanding its services,\" said Manley, adding regulatory delays pushed back construction about three to four months later than hoped.\n\nWithin the next few weeks, neighborhood residents will see steel rising at the site, Manley said. Once finished, the new two-story, L-shaped building will open and the present building will be torn down to make room for a fenced-in parking lot.\n\nThe health clinic will remain open during construction and nearby parking will be available to patients and staff, Manley explained.\n\nThe new building will have more exam rooms for each doctor, increasing efficiency and reducing wait times. Because the office also treats patients' behavioral health, it will have private counseling rooms for patients to visit with a clinical social worker.\n\nThe design includes a large community room on the first level, which can be used for educational seminars, health programs and meetings.\n\nReach Kim Mulford at (856) 486-2448 or kmulford@courierpostonline.com.
