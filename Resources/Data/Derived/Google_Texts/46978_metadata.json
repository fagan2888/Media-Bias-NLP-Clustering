(The agents were found not guilty of wrongdoing, and the Justice Department officially closed the investigation into his death in 2015.)\n\nChristian Ramirez, director of the Southern Border Communities Coalition, was with Sanders on the U.S. side of the border.\n\n\u201cI think he was struck by how Friendship Park is both a separation, and a place of encounters,\u201d said Ramirez.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always said that folks need to see for themselves what the wall looks like, and to have a sitting member of Congress \u2014 a presidential candidate \u2014 see it for himself \u2026 It\u2019s a narrative that we always talk about in the border region, but it\u2019s never talked about on the campaign trail and I think for that reason alone, it\u2019s a historic moment. This could be a turning page.\u201d\n\nFormer VOSD photographer Sam Hodgson has been following Sanders on the campaign trail, including his trip to San Diego and the border wall. Check out his Instagram feed to see some of those shots.\n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\n\nState Sen. Ricardo Lara (D-Bell Gardens) stopped in San Ysidro on May 13 as part of his tour promoting the Health for All Kids Act, a Medi-Cal expansion that now ensures everyone in the state under 19 is eligible for health care, regardless of immigration status. Gov. Jerry Brown signed the bill into law in 2015; it went into effect on May 16.\n\nAt least 185,000 California children will now be eligible for health care, said Jesse Melgar, Lara\u2019s director of communications. Brown allotted $185 million to the program for the 2016-2017 fiscal year.\n\n\u201cAfter the Affordable Care Act was passed, we realized there was a huge segment of California\u2019s population who were uninsured, specifically undocumented people,\u201d said Melgar. More than 2 million undocumented people who live in the state cannot buy health insurance, which means that insuring undocumented children is a public health issue as well as a humanitarian one.\n\n\u201cPeople still get sick, they still need to work,\u201d Melgar said. \u201cFor California, we realize that we\u2019re in a position that we\u2019re able to do something about it because in DC we\u2019re seeing a stalemate in terms of comprehensive immigration reform.\u201d\n\nThe bill potentially affects about 50,000 children in San Diego County.\n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\n\nSoccer enthusiasts and activists participated in the Copa Zapata at Oceanside Guajome Park on Saturday. The mini-tournament, which raised funds for the Caravana Contra la Repression en Mexico \u2014 the Caravan Against Repression in Mexico \u2014 is the brainchild of two brothers, Alex and Cesar Ortigoza.\n\nThe caravan aims to bring attention in the United States to the issues in Mexico, particularly repression and violence against vulnerable populations there, including the missing Ayotzinapa students, whose disappearance in September 2014 drew worldwide outrage. The tournament is named after Emiliano Zapata, the Mexican revolutionary and champion of agrarianism, whose life and death inspired a movement in Mexico.\n\nSoccer enthusiasts and activists participated in the Copa Zapata at Oceanside Guajome Park on Saturday.\n\n\u201cThe sculpture was actually ours,\u201d said Cesar Ortigoza. \u201cIt was made by this guy from Michoacan, Mexico. It was really hard for us to let it go, but it was necessary to keep the social movements going in Mexico.\u201d\n\nHe said soccer can function as a tool to raise awareness of issues that affect people throughout North America.\n\n\u201cMy brother and I thought it would be a good idea to call it the Zapata Cup, as Zapata is a symbol of social struggle for the benefit of the people,\u201d said his brother, Alex Ortigoza.\n\nTeams from San Diego to Los Angeles participated in the mini-tournament, including Legi\u00f3n (which won the title) and players representing Los Rudos, a cross-border fan club of the Tijuana Xolos.\n\nBorder News Roundup\n\n\u2022 Robin Abcarian is not impressed with the Uber-to-Mexico service.
