The headline number does not count as unemployed those \u201cdiscouraged\u201d workers who are workers without jobs who have not looked for work in the past four weeks because they believed no jobs were available.\n\nWilliams has demonstrated that it takes an expert to truly decipher BLS unemployment statistics.\n\nThe U6 unemployment rate is the BLS\u2019s broadest measure. It includes those marginally attached to the labor force and the \u201cunder-employed,\u201d who have accepted part-time jobs when they are really looking for full-time employment. Also included are the short-term discouraged workers.\n\nSince 1994, however, the long-term discouraged workers, those who have been discouraged for more than one year, have been excluded from all government data.\n\nThe only measure BLS reports to the public, as the official monthly unemployment rate, is the headline, seasonally adjusted U3 number.\n\nWilliams calculates his \u201cShadowStats Alternative Unemployment Rate\u201d by adding to the BLS U6 numbers the long-term discouraged workers, i.e., those workers who have not looked for work in more than a year, but still consider themselves to be unemployed.\n\nWilliams argues that his ShadowStats Alternative Unemployment measure most closely mirrors common experience.\n\n\u201cIf you were to survey everyone in the country as to whether they were employed or unemployed, without qualification as to when they last looked for a job, the resulting unemployment rate would be close to the ShadowStats estimate,\u201d Williams explained to WND.\n\nThe headline BLS unemployment rate has stayed relatively low because it excludes all discouraged workers, Williams argues.\n\nAs the unemployed first become discouraged and then disappear into the long-term discouraged category, they also vanish from inclusion in the headline labor force numbers. Those workers still are there, however, ready to take a job if one becomes available. They are unemployed and consider themselves to be unemployed, but the government\u2019s popularly followed unemployment reporting ignores them completely.\n\nHere is a more complete unemployment table that includes the seasonally adjusted unemployment percentages for U3 unemployment, as well as the same for U6 unemployment, followed by the ShadowStats Alternative Unemployment rate, comparing April 2013 for March and April 2014:\n\nIncreasingly, critics like Williams believe the seasonally adjusted U3 numbers reported by the BLS as the official monthly unemployment rate do not give a reliable picture of the true magnitude of unemployment in the United States.\n\n\u201cUnderlying economic reality and the fundamental drivers of economic activity would suggest a general upturn in U.3 in June, but the BLS\u2019s continuing purge of discouraged workers from the unemployment rolls and headline labor force would argue in favor of a lower rate,\u201d Williams wrote in his subscription newsletter June 25.\n\nThe BLS definitions conveniently exclude from the definition of unemployed those who have grown so discouraged that they are not actively looking for work in the past year, without distinguishing those who would look for work if there were a reasonable chance their job search might result in employment.\n\nObamanomics: an economy of part-time jobs\n\nIn August 2013, the House Ways and Means Committee documented that seven out of every eight new employees under Obama have been part-time employees, as approximately 90 percent of all jobs created in the U.S. economy since 2009 have been part-time.\n\n\u201cThe headlines citing last week\u2019s jobs report as the lowest unemployment rate in years may have been technically accurate, but they are also reminders that looks can be deceiving,\u201d the House Ways and Means report noted.\n\n\u201cThe reality, as you dig into the latest jobs data, reveals that few are finding the full-time work they want and need, and many are forced to accept part-time employment.\u201d\n\nTo support the argument, the House Ways and Means Committee produced the following table drawn from Bureau of Labor Statistics:\n\nThe House Ways and Means Committee linked to an article published Aug. 4, 2013, by Associated Press economics writer Paul Wisemanthat said: \u201cSo far this year, low-paying industries have provided 61 percent of he nation\u2019s job growth, even though these industries represent just 39 percent of overall U.S. jobs, according to Labor Department numbers analyzed by Moody\u2019s Analytics.\u201d\n\nWiseman noted part-time work has made up more than 77 percent of the job growth so far this year, with part-time work defined as being less than 25 hours a week.\n\nAppearing on PBS\u2019s \u201cMcLaughlin Group,\u201d in October 2013, real estate mogul Mort Zuckerman said 88 percent of the jobs that had been created that year were part-time jobs.\n\n\u201cA large part of the reason for that number of part-time jobs, which is unprecedented in American history, is because people are apprehensive about the impact of Obamacare and the costs of Obamacare on full-time jobs.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "NEW YORK \u2013 Anticipating the mid-term 2014 elections in November, the Obama administration appears to be manipulating unemployment numbers to mask an economy about to slip back into recession.
