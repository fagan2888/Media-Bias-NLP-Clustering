Unbroken

Rated: PG-13

Run time: 2 hours 17 minutes

Stars: Garrett Hedlund, Jack O'Connell

Director: Angelina Jolie

Angelina Jolie brings to the screen the story of U.S. Army Air Forces Lt. Louis Zamperini, whose B-24 crashed into the Pacific in May 1943. Zamperini survived 47 days in an open life raft at sea, only to be captured by the Japanese and sent to a POW camp, where he was tortured until his August 1945 release.

Much has been made of Jolie's pivot from actress to director, but despite the terrific acting and gorgeous cinematography, the result is somewhat unsatisfying. The re-creation of the brutality Zamperini suffered at the hands of his captors — especially a sadistic guard known as the Bird, played by Japanese pop star Miyavi — is relentless to the point of stomach-turning. And while Jolie overdocuments Zamperini's physical suffering, she offers too little evidence of the inner drive that enabled the onetime U.S. Olympic runner to withstand such torment and live to the age of 97.

Up-and-coming English actor Jack O'Connell (300: Rise of an Empire) does a fine job of breathing life into the energetic younger Zamperini, embodying his inner steel. But his performance cannot transcend the script: Though based on Laura Hillenbrand's magnificent best-seller Unbroken and adapted by a small army of writers (including the legendary Coen brothers), it fails to offer true highs and lows, rendering the retelling a bit monochromatic.

Jolie has proved that she can direct a movie. With this second project behind the camera, however, she may have bitten off more than we can chew. —M.G.
