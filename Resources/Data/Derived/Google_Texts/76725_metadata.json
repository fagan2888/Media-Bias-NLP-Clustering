And, because of that, he didn't want to make another appointment to see me,\u201d said Dr. Musmanno. \u201cThis is changing the doctor-patient relationship. Patients are seeing doctors as money grubbers, and we have nothing to do with that.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s little surprise that people are confused, as well as frustrated. Shopping for the best health plan requires understanding unfamiliar terms and eligibility rules, as well as a host of other variables. Without that knowledge, an apparent bargain can turn out to be a health insurance money pit.\n\n\u201cI think you\u2019re going to be hearing more about this, and the reason you\u2019re going to be hearing more is that people are signing up for low-premium plans,\u201d said Martin Giglio, communications practice leader at Buck Consultants, Downtown.\n\n\u201cWhat they don\u2019t realize is that the cost-sharing component \u2014 the cosharing and copays and so forth \u2014 may have increased. So when you are looking for a plan on the exchange, you have to look at a lot of factors, not just the premium you\u2019re paying.\u201d\n\nThe jump in medical out-of-pocket costs \u201cis not only happening to people on the exchange,\u201d added Mr. Giglio.\n\n\u201cThis past year, a lot of employer-based plans have increased their cost sharing \u2014 deductibles and coinsurance \u2014 so employers and employees are seeing the same kind of sticker shock.\u201d\n\nBill England, state director for Enroll America, the nonprofit encouraging the uninsured to find a health plan on the exchange, said the navigators who assist people signing up do explain all the costs.\n\nHowever, with only six navigators covering Allegheny, Beaver and Butler counties, there are likely not enough navigators to help everyone who needs it by the Monday enrollment deadline.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure we had enough to start with,\u201d said Mr. England. \u201cCountless people have never had insurance so, in talking to the assisters, they\u2019re spending significant time explaining the plans.\u201d\n\nMike Fraser, CEO of the Pennsylvania Medical Society physicians association, said he\u2019s hearing at least one sticker shock anecdote \u201cpretty much from every county medical society\u201d and he\u2019s expecting more will follow.\n\nIn one case, a physician told him, a patient decided to postpone surgery because of the copayment and other out-of-pocket costs.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s certainly not going to make anyone any better,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Experts are warning that people are going to be surprised by the high deductibles in some plans with the lowest premiums.", "og": {"site_name": "Pittsburgh Post-Gazette", "description": "Last-minute shoppers to the health insurance marketplace plans might do well to heed the advice of Butler County physician Mark Musmanno: Know what you\u2019re signing up for.
