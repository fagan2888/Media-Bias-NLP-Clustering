John Kasich held an upbeat rally at Villanova University Wednesday as he continued his bid for the White House.Speaking to a friendly crowd of students, faculty and area residents, Kasich delivered his message of down-to-earth, practical conservatism to a standing-room-only crowd of about 650 at Connelly Center, with another 200 watching via video in another room.Telling folksy stories, Kasich highlighted his experience in Congress balancing the budget and also helping to turn around the economy in Ohio. He spoke of reducing the government regulations that hamper small businesses, reducing taxes and having the \u201ctired, worn out, not responsive\u201d federal government become leaner to help solve problems.And, Kasich made the case that he is perhaps the only remaining GOP contender who can beat Hillary Clinton in the fall.He warmed up the crowd with his life story of growing up the son of a mailman and grandson of a coal miner in McKees Rocks, a small town near Pittsburgh, then going to Ohio State University.There he went to talk to the university president and learned that he was going to Washington, D.C., to talk to President Nixon.

Wages are growing faster than the national average, our pensions are secure.\u201d After some applause, he added, \u201cWhen things start growing we have to make sure we don\u2019t leave anybody behind.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI do not believe it is moral in America for the mentally ill to be sleeping under a bridge,\u201d said Kasich. \u201cYou do know that sometimes life is hard.\u201d He told the students there is no shame in asking for help. In Ohio they treat prisoners who are drug addicts and have an 80 percent success rate, he said.\n\n\n\nKasich said the federal government is now $19 trillion in debt and pays $225 billion in interest annually. He suggested that some of that interest could be better used to help with student loans. And also make sure that Social Security is there for the students, so they don\u2019t have \u201ca better chance of seeing a UFO than a Social Security check.\u201d\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. has the highest corporate tax in the world so companies are moving jobs and capital oversees, he said.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe strength of our country rests in us,\u201d he said. He said that he was as \u201cidealistic today as when I sat in that chair at Ohio State. We are fighting for the future of our country.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAs I continue to pursue this campaign, I am not going to take the low road to the (White House),\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nAfter his stump speech, Kasich took questions from the crowd. 1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nSee Full Story When he hears about kids joining ISIS, or joining gangs or turning to drugs because they are \u201clonely and frustrated,\u201d he thinks that \u201cmaybe no one ever told them how special they are.\u201d He called on the students to reach out in friendship to their fellow students.Pivoting to the economy, Kasich noted that \u201ceverything is changing\u201d except the government, so what we have to do is think about how do we lower the costs and deliver better services?\u201dInstead of changing things, politicians are afraid they won\u2019t be reelected or are listening to special interests, he said.\u201cWhen I run against Hillary she is going to talk about the Clinton economy, which we (in the Republican Congress) brought about by balancing the budget,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd in Ohio, we went from a loss of 350,000 jobs to a gain of over 400,000.

America needs to lead in the fight against ISIS, he said.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have to destroy them, and then come home,\u201d he said.
