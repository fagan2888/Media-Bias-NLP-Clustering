Now that Ben Carson has risen to the top of the polls, it won't be long before his rivals start looking for his weak spots. Carson's Achilles heel, Politico predicts, will likely be his glaring self-contradiction:

Ben Carson calls abortion murder but thinks states should decide whether it's legal.
