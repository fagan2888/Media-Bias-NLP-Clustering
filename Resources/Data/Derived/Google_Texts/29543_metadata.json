Screen shot, YouTube.com\n\nPopping a zit or pimple is already pretty satisfying, but what about popping zits you\u2019ve unknowingly had for years? Kris Honey\u2019s 11-year-old daughter did exactly that after figuring out bumpy tissue on her ear was really a cyst, BuzzFeed reported.\n\nHoney explained that her daughter has had this \u201cear zit\u201d for 6 years, since she was about 2 or 3 years old. The two thought it was scar tissue until her daughter grew curious and tried to pop it like any ole zit. In the video Honey posted to YouTube (copied below), viewers can see everything that ensues, including the years-worth of pus that one YouTube commenter described as silly string.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s been self-conscious about it for years,\u201d Honey said. \u201cShe\u2019s so very happy it\u2019s gone!\u201d\n\nFurther in the video\u2019s comment section are several concerned users claiming to be registered nurses \u2014 if Honey's daughter doesn\u2019t see a dermatologist to \u201cget the cyst wall out,\u201d it\u2019s likely it will come back. According to Everyday Health, this may be a valid concern.\n\nCysts are a sac-like structure that fill with various materials, but when they specifically fill with pus, they become an abscess. The National Institutes of Health cites abscesses occur when an area of tissue becomes infected, and the resulting pus is \"the buildup of fluid, living and dead white blood cells, dead tissue, and bacteria or other foreign substances.\" These abscesses have a distinct cell wall, which secrete proteins that smell terrible when they're drained. You can drain them on your own (here's how to do it safely), but often times surgery is required to completely drain and remove any materials to prevent further infection or inflammation.\n\nReally, it all depends on where the cyst or abscess is located, as well as how it feels. Given the amount of time Honey's daughter had her zit, it may be a good idea to visit the doctor, just in case.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "pop, zit, young, girl, squeezes, 6, years, worth, pus, out, her, ear", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "One girl squeezes out the pus that's been collecting in her ear for years, but she may still need to see a dermatologist to keep it from coming back.", "title": "Watch This Girl Pop A Zit She's Had For 6 Years", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/pop-zit-young-girl-squeezes-6-years-worth-pus-out-her-ear-349030", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2015/08/22/pop-zit.JPG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "One girl squeezes out the pus that's been collecting in her ear for years, but she may still need to see a dermatologist to keep it from coming back.", "title": "Watch This Girl Pop A Zit She's Had For 6 Years", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/pop-zit-young-girl-squeezes-6-years-worth-pus-out-her-ear-349030", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2015/08/22/pop-zit.JPG", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/08/22/pop-zit.JPG"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-08-22T15:29:33-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-22T17:39:30-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "One girl squeezes out the pus that's been collecting in her ear for years, but she may still need to see a dermatologist to keep it from coming back."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda01e\"", "article_summary": "Honey explained that her daughter has had this \u201cear zit\u201d for 6 years, since she was about 2 or 3 years old.\nOne girl squeezes out the pus that's been collecting in her ear for years, but she may still need to see a dermatologist to keep it from coming back.\nGiven the amount of time Honey's daughter had her zit, it may be a good idea to visit the doctor, just in case.\nKris Honey\u2019s 11-year-old daughter did exactly that after figuring out bumpy tissue on her ear was really a cyst, BuzzFeed reported.\nCysts are a sac-like structure that fill with various materials, but when they specifically fill with pus, they become an abscess."}
