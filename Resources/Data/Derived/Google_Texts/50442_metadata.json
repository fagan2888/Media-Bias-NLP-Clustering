Last month, Martin Shkreli, CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals and mega-Democrat donor, was savaged by the media after hiking the price of a generic drug used mostly to treat AIDS patients by 5,000 percent. He became a pi\u00f1ata for the Hillary Clinton campaign.\n\nLast week, federal and state prosecutors sent subpoenas to drug company Valeant over its recent price hikes for at least two of its disease-fighting medicines. Democrats in Congress have been pressing for hearings on recent increases in drug prices, especially generic drugs. With a national election just a year away, these recent actions are just the first moves in a politically charged issue.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nThe issue of drug prices, which had been a political football for much of the \u201990s and \u201900s, never really went away. Instead it was supplanted by the larger debate over ObamaCare.\n\nDrug companies signed on to supporting ObamaCare, even running ads touting the law, and publicly offered $80 billion in \u201cdiscounts\u201d over a decade in exchange for a lighter regulatory touch. The exact details of that \u201cagreement\u201d are, naturally, secret. But it is widely accepted that the PhRMA \u201cdiscount\u201d precluded government action on allowing imports of prescription drugs or price controls for Medicare recipients.\n\nThe federal government is, after all, PhRMA\u2019s biggest customer. In 2013, the government, and certain Medicare beneficiaries, spent over $100 billion on prescription drugs. That figure only includes drugs prescribed under the Medicare Part D prescription drug coverage program, and doesn\u2019t include Medicaid or other government health systems.\n\nNow that ObamaCare is being fully implemented, health companies, including drug companies, are adapting their businesses to maximize their returns under the new law. As ObamaCare creaks under the weight of completely unrealistic cost-projections, the government will look for savings far beyond what PhRMA offered when the law was under consideration.\n\nDrug companies naturally need to find revenue where they can, to weather the coming political debate.\n\nIn recent months, drug companies have turned their sites on an obscure, 20-year old federal program that provides discounted drugs to many poor and small hospitals. The so-called 340B program was created in the 1990s to allow \u201ccritical access\u201d hospitals, serving low-income communities, to purchase outpatient prescription drugs at prices discounted by the government. Drug companies were \u201cencouraged,\u201d as the government would no doubt phrase it, to participate in the program by winning access to other government programs in exchange.\n\nJust over 2,000 hospitals, many in rural areas, participate in the program, but the overall impact of the discounts on big PhRMA are modest. The entire program purchases only around $7 billion worth of discounted drugs a year, around 2 percent of the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s revenues.\n\nThe drug industry recently launched a new advocacy group, \u201cAlliance for Integrity and Reform 340B\u201d to curtail or eliminate the 340B discount program. Major pharmaceutical firms, and many organizations that receive funding from them, are \u201cmembers\u201d of the AIR340B group. The group is run by Washington, D.C. PR firm Venn Strategies.\n\nAs health care policy moves into the post-ObamaCare debate, the health care industry has already begun aggressive lobbying to carve out new benefits. The 340B program was noncontroversial for most of its 20+ year existence, but even an obscure program like it can mean billions to the bottom line of a major drug company.\n\nSoon, no doubt, there will be Congressional hearings on recent price increases by generic drug manufacturers, but those are just the headline-grabbing fronts of a multi-billion fight in the health care trenches. The government is in firm control of the nation\u2019s health care system. In fighting for a slice of that, even a small discount drug program for poor hospitals is on the table.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The issue of prescription drug prices is drawing the media spotlight.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "The issue of prescription drug prices is drawing the media spotlight.", "title": "Big PhRMA Tries to Stiffle Discount Drug Program - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/10/Pharmacy-Getty.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/10/18/big-phrma-tries-stiffle-discount-drug-program/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The issue of prescription drug prices is drawing the media spotlight.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/10/Pharmacy-Getty.jpg", "title": "Big PhRMA Tries to Stiffle Discount Drug Program - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": ",Big Government,drug", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "published_time": "2015-10-18T14:30:48-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "In fighting for a slice of that, even a small discount drug program for poor hospitals is on the table.\nNow that ObamaCare is being fully implemented, health companies, including drug companies, are adapting their businesses to maximize their returns under the new law.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe issue of prescription drug prices is drawing the media spotlight.\nBut it is widely accepted that the PhRMA \u201cdiscount\u201d precluded government action on allowing imports of prescription drugs or price controls for Medicare recipients.\nDrug companies naturally need to find revenue where they can, to weather the coming political debate."}
