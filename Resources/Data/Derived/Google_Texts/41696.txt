The South Dakota Highway Patrol is out in force as Memorial Day marks the kick-off of the summer travel season.



Superintendent of the Highway Patrol Col. Craig Price says their presence reminds motorists to use common sense. He says seeing law enforcement helps encourage good habits while driving.



The Highway Patrol is participating in the "Drive to Save Lives" all year. The program is an effort with 40 other states to reduce traffic fatalities.



Patrols also participated in "Operation Safe Summer Kickoff" Friday to encourage safe driving. Most of the state's uniformed officers saturated the roads, educating people and enforcing traffic laws.
