Learn how one of the largest federally qualified health centers in the nation is transitioning to a patient-centered, physician-friendly, interoperable health system.\n\nProviding a continuum of care to underserved populations\n\nACCESS Health System operates 36 health centers across Chicago and Cook and DuPage counties. Their mission: \u201cTo provide outstanding preventive and primary health care, accessible to all in their own communities,\u201d said Jairo Mejia, MD, chief medical officer at ACCESS.\n\n\u201cWe serve the medically underserved and the most vulnerable communities,\u201d Dr. Mejia said. \u201cWe screen patients for social determinants like food insecurity, housing and behavioral issues.\u201d ACCESS uses a team-based care model rooted in evidence-based practices to coordinate this care across their three dozen health centers.\n\nWith the Affordable Care Act in place, large numbers of newly insured patients are seeking care. Many patients mention that they haven\u2019t seen a physician since their last pediatric visit, Dr. Mejia said. \u201c[That appointment] was when they were a teen, and now they are 65\u2014and that\u2019s an everyday reality.\u201d\n\nTo prevent patients from falling into such gaps, ACCESS tries to engage their patients in a continuum of care. \u201cOur interactions with the patients are not limited to the visits,\u201d Dr. Mejia said. \u201cWe have a constant, permanent interaction with them through our [patient portal].\u201d\n\nPatients now have the ability to schedule appointments, view their records and communicate with physicians. These patients can seek care at any of the 36 health centers with their records fully available to each physician they see. ACCESS now has close to 50,000 patients using the patient portal to communicate with their physicians.\n\n\u201cWe are [emphasizing] sharing the decisions of care with the patients,\u201d Dr. Mejia said. It\u2019s not the relationship of the past where the physician gives a prescription and says you have to do this and that\u2019s all, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s really involving the patients in making their own decisions.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the new model in medicine. Patients come to your office knowing everything because they visited Dr. Google, and Dr. Google gave them a lot of information,\u201d and ACCESS is working hard to make sure patients are more involved, he said.\n\nChanging the organization for value, not volume\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of talk about the paradigm change from volume to value,\u201d Dr. Mejia said. \u201cIn the past, it was \u2018see as many patients as you can\u2014you have to see one patient every 15 minutes and rush.\u2019 And now it\u2019s \u2018Dr. Mejia, we need you to [provide] quality and value.\u2019 \u2026 We need to really care for the patient in a holistic way.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis transition is a struggle,\u201d he said, \u201cand we are working in little baby steps to transition to this model of care.\u201d\n\nACCESS became a patient-centered medical home three years ago. \u201cWe started with a self-assessment of our organization to see where we were at,\u201d Dr. Mejia said.\n\nThey provided comprehensive training for staff and physicians and carefully reviewed every process in the organization. \u201cThe [physicians and staff] embraced the process,\u201d he said. ACCESS\u2019 36 health centers are now level three patient-centered medical homes.\n\n\u201cWe huddle every day in our clinics,\u201d he said. \u201cWe plan and we see the schedules and we see who\u2019s coming to the visit\u2014we plan ahead of the visit.\u201d\n\nLearn how to implement daily huddles in your practice with a module from the AMA\u2019s STEPS Forward\u2122 collection of practice improvement strategies.\n\nWhat ACCESS is doing for their physicians\n\nLike physicians in many practices and systems across the nation, physicians at ACCESS were feeling the heat of burnout. So ACCESS took steps to change this.\n\nListening: First, Dr. Mejia said, \u201clisten and get them involved.\u201d Dr. Mejia often holds meetings with physicians to talk about the issues they are facing. \u201cAt the end of one meeting,\u201d he said, \u201cI had this wonderful experience where a doctor said, \u2018We probably didn\u2019t solve anything today, but you know, we need to vent sometimes, and we need someone to listen to us.\u2019\u201d\n\nQuality: The quality structure at ACCESS involves many departments. \u201cWe used to have a quality department, but we don\u2019t have it anymore [because] it\u2019s ineffective,\u201d Dr. Mejia said. \u201cIn order for quality to work, you need to involve everyone in the organization\u2014every single person.\u201d Now, just as patients can view their EHR, ACCESS has a dashboard through which physicians can see their quality metrics in real time.\n\n\u201cIt is a multidisciplinary approach,\u201d he said. Groups from each department in the health system report every month to a quality advisory committee.\n\nTime: \u201cOptimizing the processes is important to us,\u201d Dr. Mejia said. \u201cDoctors\u2019 time is gold. We don\u2019t want to waste the time of the doctor.\u201d Their ultimate goal, he said, is that the physicians\u2019 responsibilities are to show up to the exam room, see the patient and complete the charting.\n\nFor this reason, they are enhancing the medical assistants\u2019 roles to make sure physicians\u2019 time is used in the most valuable way\u2014patient care.\n\nFlexibility: Leadership at ACCESS also makes sure to be flexible with scheduling. \u201cMany doctors want to work three 12-hour shifts, and that\u2019s fine,\u201d he said. \u201cOr they want to work four 10-hour shifts, and that\u2019s fine too. We need to facilitate things to make the lives of our [physicians] a little bit easier.\u201d\n\nTeamwork: \u201cWhen we talk about teamwork,\u201d Dr. Mejia said, \u201cthis is our teamwork structure: An MD or DO working in two health centers and collaborating with advanced nurse practitioners. All of them have a panel of patients, and all of them work in the same EHR environment.\u201d\n\nRead more about ACCESS and their work to improve health outcomes in the communities of patients they serve.\n\nBy AMA staff writer Troy Parks", "article_metadata": {"WT.cg_n": "News", "articleDescription": "Across the nation, care models are shifting from volume to value-based care\u2014and this means getting to the heart of every process within a medical practice.
