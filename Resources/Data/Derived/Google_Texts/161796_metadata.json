Ted Cruz attempted to campaign in the Bronx on Wednesday, but \u201cNew York values\u201d weren\u2019t so welcoming to the Republican presidential candidate.\n\nThe New York Daily News reported that the Texas senator was scheduled to speak at the Bronx Lighthouse College Preparatory Academy, but students weren\u2019t having it. They wrote a letter to the principal that said if Cruz came, they were leaving.\n\n\u201cA group of students will be leaving during 4th period, as (an) act of civil disobedience in regards to the arrival of Ted Cruz to BLCPA,\u201d the letter said. \u201cWe have all considered the consequences of our actions and are willing to accept them. The presence of Ted Cruz and the ideas he stands for are offensive. His views are against ours and are actively working to harm us, our community, and the people we love. \u201c\n\nThey called Cruz \u201cmisogynistic, homophobic, and racist\u201d in the letter, and some students claimed his views were against their immigrant backgrounds, despite the fact that Cruz is the son of an immigrant himself.\n\n\u201cWe told [the principal] if he came here, we would schedule a walkout,\u201d BLCPA student Destiny Domeneck told the Daily News. \u201cMost of us are immigrants or come from immigrant backgrounds. Ted Cruz goes against everything our school stands for.\u201d\n\nKhori Whittaker, the CEO of Lighthouse Academies, agreed to cancel the visit and the school\u2019s principal Alix Duggins commended the students for the \u201ccommitment to your beliefs and values.\u201d\n\nCall me crazy, but I thought a school principal\u2019s job was to expand student\u2019s minds and encourage them to hear differing views, rationalize them, and come to a conclusion.\n\nIt\u2019s sad that at such a young age students have already figured out how to claim that they\u2019re offended and triggered by what someone may or may not say in front of them.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "(AP Photo/Paul Sancya) Sen.
