Two late September emails from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) tell the story.\n\nA September 26 email stated, \u201cthe results are not good and not consistent at all.\u201d A September 27 email likewise depicted pending failure: \u201cThe scripts are failing so far due to issues like load balancing, inefficient and defective code, and inefficient queries. We have not been successful in moving beyond 500 concurrent users filling applications without income verification.\u201d\n\nAs Bob Schieffer put it on Sunday, \u201cevery day there just seems to be some new mind boggling development about the problems with Obamacare . . . There\u2019s now evidence that people in the White House, including the President, were briefed months before the program started that there were some flaws here.\u201d\n\nYet only earlier this month, Obama told Americans, \u201cWe would not have rolled out something knowing very well that it wasn\u2019t going to work the way it was supposed to, given all the scrutiny that we knew was going to be on the website.\u201d Really?\n\nObama\u2019s credibility is in free fall as the gap between presidential rhetoric and reality grows ever greater. Americans are already living through Obama\u2019s promise that \u201cif you like your current insurance, you keep that insurance.\u201d Now, we are about to find out that \u201cNo matter how we reform health care. . .we will keep this promise: if you like your doctor, you will be able to keep your doctor. Period,\u201d was at best wishful thinking, and outright deception at worst.\n\nNot surprisingly, America is losing patience with Obamacare and Obama. Support for Obamacare steadily leaches out, with nearly three in five Americans now opposing the President's eponymous achievement. Can you really blame House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi for saying that she always called Obamacare the Affordable Care Act? Failure is an orphan.\n\nBut even more damaging than the public\u2019s loss of confidence in Obamacare is America\u2019s growing distrust of the President\u2019s integrity and competence. Half the country thinks of him as less than truthful. Obama\u2019s approval rating is 40 percent, his disapproval is 55 percent, and his base is unhappy.\n\nWomen (53 percent) and suburbanites (58 percent) now disapprove of him, according to the latest CNN poll. To put things in context, Obama won 55 percent of the women\u2019s vote and captured America\u2019s suburbs, as he bested Mitt Romney. If the presidential election were held today, a recent Washington Post/ABC News poll reported that Romney would have his revenge. Clearly, 2013 is Obama\u2019s annus horribilis, his terrible, horrible, no good, very bad year.\n\nIndeed, 2014 doesn\u2019t look much brighter as the Democrats head into the midterm elections. Growing hostility toward Obamacare will present an even more serious problem for Obama and the Democrats, and their upstairs-downstairs brand of coalition politics.\n\nFrom the start, Obamacare was premised upon a wealth transfer from the Republican base to America\u2019s poor and minority communities, much as the Obamans have tried to hide this fact. As Thomas Edsall of Columbia\u2019s School of Journalism explained, \u201cthe Affordable Care Act can be construed as a transfer of benefits from Medicare, which serves an overwhelmingly white population of the elderly\u201477 percent of recipients are white\u2014to Obamacare, which will serve a population that is 54.7 percent minority.\u201d Over a decade, the ACA stands to slash $455 billion from Medicare budget to help pay for Obamacare.\n\nRecently, Rep. James Clyburn (D-SC), the third-ranking Democrat in the House, was only slightly more forthright about the demographics that underpin Obamacare. On CNN, Clyburn acknowledged that Obamacare was an attempt to change America\u2019s \u201cvalue system.\u201d\n\nStill, coming from Clyburn, that\u2019s a huge admission. According to Double Down, the campaign recap by Time\u2019s Mark Halperin and New York Magazine\u2019s John Heilemann, Clyburn is one of the few members of the House whom Obama respects.\n\nThe redistributive impulse that is Obamacare wreaked havoc in the 2010 midterms and may do so again. Already, the Senate seat being vacated by Montana Democrat Max Baucus looks as if it will fall into Republican hands. Rep. Steve Daines leads prospective Democratic challengers by at least 15 points as they vie to replace Baucus.\n\nFor the record, it was Baucus who shepherded Obamacare through the Senate, together with Jim Messina, Baucus\u2019s former chief of staff, Obama\u2019s senior White House aide, and reelection campaign honcho. Obamacare was their baby, too, and to his credit it was Baucus who warned that Obamacare could become a train wreck.\n\nGet The Beast In Your Inbox!

Messina busily stroked Google and Silicon Valley for Obama 2012; Obamacare, not so much.\n\nThe Economist summed it up like this: \u201ca man with little interest in details and a disdain for business, Obama tried to impose a gigantic change on the whole country all at once and far too casually.\u201d Obama\u2019s cool and Obamacare\u2019s failure may have seriously damaging consequences for the Democrats.\n\nUpscale America will likely go Republican in 2014, just as it did in 2010 and 2012. Yes, wealthier Americans voted Democratic in 2008, but that was a protest against Bush and his war.\n\nStill, all this might be manageable for Team Obama, except for one thing\u2014middle America now has a real bone to pick with the President. Nationwide, Obama\u2019s approval is lowest in the Midwest (36 percent). Even the South likes him better. And unlike the South, the Midwest went for Obama, not Romney.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "Obamacare", "publicationDate": 201311261045, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "description": "The Obamacare debacle and his plummeting approval rating are a sign that Americans are done hoping for change from this administration.", "pageNum": 1, "title": "Obamas Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Year", "tags": "Obamacare:Industryterm", "environment": "dev", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "type": "house", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Obama\u2019s Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Year\",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/11/26/obama-s-terrible-horrible-no-good-very-bad-year.html\",\"image_url\":\"http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2013/11/26/obama-s-terrible-horrible-no-good-very-bad-year/jcr:content/image.crop.410.273.jpg/46183734.cached.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2013/11/26/obama-s-terrible-horrible-no-good-very-bad-year\",\"pub_date\":\"2013-11-26T10:45:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"Politics\",\"author\":\"Lloyd Green\",\"tags\":[\"Industryterm\"]}", "news_keywords": "Obamacare", "sectionTaxanomies": "politics", "fb": {"admins": "1703087,30000737,1117577220,1276800108,931159,514915512", "app_id": 189930913679}, "authors": "Lloyd Green", "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-26T10:45:00.000Z", "author": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/lloyd-greenhtml"}, "resourceType": "dailybeast2/components/pages/article", "contentpath": "/content/dailybeast/articles/2013/11/26/obama-s-terrible-horrible-no-good-very-bad-year", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "The Obamacare debacle and his plummeting approval rating are a sign that Americans are done hoping for change from this administration.", "title": "Obama\u2019s Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Year", "url": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/11/26/obama-s-terrible-horrible-no-good-very-bad-year.html", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2013/11/26/obama-s-terrible-horrible-no-good-very-bad-year/jcr:content/image.img.2000.jpg/1385512037804.cached.jpg", "type": "article"}, "authorIds": "/etc/authors/l/lloyd-green", "content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8"}, "article_summary": "Clearly, 2013 is Obama\u2019s annus horribilis, his terrible, horrible, no good, very bad year.\nObama\u2019s credibility is in free fall as the gap between presidential rhetoric and reality grows ever greater.\nFor the record, it was Baucus who shepherded Obamacare through the Senate, together with Jim Messina, Baucus\u2019s former chief of staff, Obama\u2019s senior White House aide, and reelection campaign honcho.\nOn CNN, Clyburn acknowledged that Obamacare was an attempt to change America\u2019s \u201cvalue system.\u201dStill, coming from Clyburn, that\u2019s a huge admission.\nBut even more damaging than the public\u2019s loss of confidence in Obamacare is America\u2019s growing distrust of the President\u2019s integrity and competence."}
