The Nuggets\u2019 field-goal percentage had been dwindling fast as the quarter moved along.\n\nBut it was soon clear that making shots wasn\u2019t their only problem, or even their biggest. The Nuggets\u2019 121-101 loss to the Boston Celtics on Sunday afternoon at the Pepsi Center was built on myriad shortcomings \u2014 defense and turnovers topped the list.\n\nNuggets Mailbag: Pose a question for Christopher Dempsey\n\n\u201cIt was a lack of fight, a lack of togetherness,\u201d Malone said. \u201cWe quit on a number of plays, and I thought we were a very selfish team \u2014 two things I hate to see from any team.\u201d\n\nIt left Malone scratching his head as to why it happened.\n\n\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been who we\u2019ve been,\u201d he said. \u201cBut sometimes what happens is that after the all-star break, and once that trade deadline is over with, sometimes you see true colors come out. I hope (Sunday\u2019s game) was just an anomaly and not who we are.\u201d\n\nA mad scramble with about 10 minutes left in the game said all that needed to be said about where each team was in its focus. Jusuf Nurkic lost the ball on Denver\u2019s offensive end and, after being knocked around, was rolling with a ton of pace away from everyone toward the Boston basket, headed out of bounds it seemed.\n\nBut no.\n\nEvan Turner turned on the jets and ran down the ball just before it hit out of bounds. He saved it, flipping it behind his back to Avery Bradley, who was the only other player to not give up on the play. Bradley caught the pass and laid it in to put the Celtics up 15 points. Two Celtics hustling on the play. No Nuggets in the picture.\n\nTimeout, Nuggets.\n\nIt was just was well. Save for a couple of stretches, the Nuggets had been generally out-worked all game long. The Celtics played harder, smarter basketball. And they put the pressure on from the very start, establishing a cat-quick pace in the first quarter and never letting up. The Nuggets found it difficult to get back and set their defense, whether they missed or made a bucket. And the basketball was whipped around the perimeter so quickly, the Denver defensive rotations were constantly a step slow altogether.\n\nPHOTOS: Here are the best action shots from the Nuggets loss\n\nThe first sign it was not going to be the Nuggets\u2019 day came after they took a 7-4 lead in the first quarter. Boston hit them with a 13-2 run to take a 17-9 lead, and the Celtics never trailed again.\n\n\u201cThey had more energy than us from the jump,\u201d said rookie guard Emmanuel Mudiay.\n\nThe Celtics created a 26-point lead in the second quarter before the Nuggets woke up. They started chipping away. Finally, their energy was higher. Finally, their efficiency was better. By halftime they had Boston\u2019s lead down to 15 points. They chopped that lead to five to start the third quarter.\n\nBut in the blink of an eye the Celtics were back up by 16, and only Will Barton\u2019s 3-pointer late in the third quarter saved the Nuggets from that deficit going into the fourth.\n\nBoston cruised from there, sweeping the season series and handing the Nuggets their second consecutive loss coming off the NBA all-star break.\n\nDenver turnovers piled 24 high. The Celtics happily cashed in those for 29 points.\n\nThe Nuggets were led by Nikola Jokic\u2019s 23 points and 13 rebounds. Danilo Gallinari added 17 points. Boston was led by Isaiah Thomas\u2019 22 points and 12 assists.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to learn from this game,\u201d said Denver guard D.J. Augustin, \u201cand come out in our next game and play harder than we did tonight.\u201d\n\nChristopher Dempsey: cdempsey@denverpost.com or @dempseypost", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Nuggets don\u2019t match Boston Celtics\u2019 intensity in loss at home", "title": "Nuggets don\u2019t match Boston Celtics\u2019 intensity in loss at home", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/02/21/nuggets-dont-match-boston-celtics-intensity-in-loss-at-home/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160221__nuggets-celticsp1.jpg", "height": 467}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160221__nuggets-celticsp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-21T17:54:32+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-18T02:20:22+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The Nuggets\u2019 121-101 loss to the Boston Celtics on Sunday afternoon at the Pepsi Center was built on myriad shortcomings \u2014 defense and turnovers topped the list.\nFinally, Nuggets coach Michael Malone had to break the emergency glass and put Mike Miller into the game.\nBoston cruised from there, sweeping the season series and handing the Nuggets their second consecutive loss coming off the NBA all-star break.\nBoston hit them with a 13-2 run to take a 17-9 lead, and the Celtics never trailed again.\nThe Celtics created a 26-point lead in the second quarter before the Nuggets woke up."}
