Lerner was the head of the non-profit division of the IRS when details first emerged that the agency had been unfairly targeting conservative organizations.\n\nIn the video, it becomes apparent very quickly that Lerner does not like providing answers nearly as much as she enjoyed demanding them from conservative organizations:\n\nAt one point, Lerener even tried to wrangle her way into a neighbor\u2019s home in order to avoid answering Mattera\u2019s questions. Earlier this year, the U.S. House of Representatives voted to hold her in contempt for refusing to answer questions about or cooperate with the congressional investigation of the IRS.\n\nThe most amazing part of Mattera\u2019s video isn\u2019t his questions or even Lois Lerner\u2019s response to them \u2014 it\u2019s how her own neighbors treated her when she tried to enter their home to escape Mattera\u2019s questions.\n\n\u201cCould you call the police, please\u201d Lerner asked as she knocked on the door of a neighbor\u2019s home while Mattera and his cameraman stood harmessly several steps behind here.\n\nWhen a woman who lived in the home answered the door, she did not seem pleased with Lerner\u2019s intrusion.\n\n\u201cWait a minute. I\u2019ve got a broken\u2026I\u2019ve just had surgery. Can you wait?\u201d the unidentified woman said to Lerner.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t feel bad that you used government as a weapon to crush political dissent?\u201d Mattera asked Lerner while she waited for her neighbor to rescue her from the indignity of having to answer questions about her taxpayer-funded work at the IRS.\n\n\u201cPlease let me in,\u201d Lerner said to her neighbor. \u201cThese guys are the press and they\u2019re not leaving me alone. I just want to come in for a second.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan I go in the garage?\u201d Lerner pleaded. \u201cI really need to come in for one second.\u201d\n\nAt that point, the neighbor\u2019s husband came outside to confront Mattera and Lerner.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s trying to get in your house. She doesn\u2019t want to answer questions,\u201d Mattera told the man, who then interjected and said, \u201cBut I don\u2019t want her in my house!\u201d", "article_metadata": {"item-publish-date": "Tue, 07 Oct 2014 14:13:18 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "The Federalist", "description": "An investigative reporter tracked down Lois Lerner in her neighborhood, and from the looks of the video, Lerner's neighbors don't seem to like her at all.", "title": "VIDEO: Lois Lerner's Neighbors Don't Seem To Like Her Very Much", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Lois-Lerner-Hates-Questions.png", "updated_time": "2014-10-08T10:51:59+00:00", "url": "http://thefederalist.com/2014/10/07/video-lois-lerners-neighbors-dont-seem-to-like-her-very-much/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Federalist", "description": "An investigative reporter tracked down Lois Lerner in her neighborhood, and from the looks of the video, Lerner's neighbors don't seem to like her at all.", "title": "VIDEO: Lois Lerner's Neighbors Don't Seem To Like Her Very Much", "image": {"src": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Lois-Lerner-Hates-Questions.png"}, "creator": "@FDRLST", "site": "@FDRLST", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article": {"section": "Taxes", "tag": "Contempt,Editors Picks,IRS,IRS Targeting,Jason Mattera,Lois Lerner", "published_time": "2014-10-07T14:13:18+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-08T10:51:59+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "An investigative reporter tracked down Lois Lerner in her neighborhood, and from the looks of the video, Lerner's neighbors don't seem to like her at all."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcca8c\"", "article_summary": "She doesn\u2019t want to answer questions,\u201d Mattera told the man, who then interjected and said, \u201cBut I don\u2019t want her in my house!\u201d\nThe most amazing part of Mattera\u2019s video isn\u2019t his questions or even Lois Lerner\u2019s response to them \u2014 it\u2019s how her own neighbors treated her when she tried to enter their home to escape Mattera\u2019s questions.\nReporter and video guru Jason Mattera managed to track down IRS scofflaw Lois Lerner, and the results are pretty amazing.\n\u201cI really need to come in for one second.\u201dAt that point, the neighbor\u2019s husband came outside to confront Mattera and Lerner.\nMattera caught up to Lois Lerner as she was walking her dog in her neighborhood and did his best to ask her questions about her role in the ongoing IRS targeting scandal."}
