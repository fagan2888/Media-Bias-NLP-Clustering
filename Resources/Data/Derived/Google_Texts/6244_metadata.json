Martin O\u2019Malley\u2019s lieutenant governor.\n\nThat Hogan, a businessman and son of a former congressman, would even be close this late is a surprise.\n\nDemocratic voters outnumber Republicans 2-to-1 in Maryland. And only two Republicans have held the governor\u2019s office the past four decades.\n\nBut a sluggish local economy and years of tax increases by the O\u2019Malley administration -- including an infamous \u201crain water tax\" -- appears to have voters looking for a change.\n\n2016 Election Headquarters The latest headlines on the 2016 elections from the biggest name in politics. See Latest Coverage \u2192\n\nBrown had led the race by double digits from the start. But recent polls -- including one by The Baltimore Sun in mid-October that indicated Brown ahead by just 7 percentage points -- have shown his lead starting to slip.\n\nHowever, the turning point seemed to occur after a Republican-sponsored poll released Monday showed Hogan trailing Brown by just 2 percentage points, 46-to-44 percent.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little crazy right now, but we believe everything is now breaking our way,\u201d Hogan said Wednesday from the campaign trail. \u201cThe timing is perfect. The momentum is there for Democrats and independents. There\u2019s a full-scale tax revolt in deep-blue Maryland.\u201d\n\nThough the poll was commissioned by the Hogan campaign, pollsters, Democrats, Republicans and essentially everybody else with an interest in the midterms took notice.\n\nNew Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, chairman of the Republican Governors Association, arrived Tuesday in Maryland, for his third visit of the cycle, and was followed two days later by Hillary Clinton, whose many titles now include one of the most influential Democrats on the campaign trail.\n\nAnd within the past four days, two of Washington\u2019s most respected, nonpartisan pollsters have changed their handicap of the race to show Brown on less-sure footing.\n\nOn Friday, the Cook Political Report moved the race into its \u201ctossup\u201d category. And on Wednesday, the Rothenberg Political Report shifted the race for Democrats from \u201cfavored\u201d to the lesser \u201clean.\u201d\n\nHogan spokesman Adam Dubitsky suggests Maryland Democrats have taken Hogan too lightly, pointing out that Brown, a Harvard law school graduate who served in Iraq, said during his tough primary race that winning the general election would just be \u201ca little bit of a mole hill.\u201d\n\nThe Brown campaign did not return calls seeking comment. However, campaign spokesman Justin Schall has downplayed the notion that the national attention suggests Brown is fading.\n\n\"That is Republicans' wishful thinking,\" he told The Sun.\n\nThe last Republican to win the Maryland governorship was Robert Ehrlich in 2002. He was preceded by Spiro Agnew in 1967. Ehrlich was defeated in 2006 by O\u2019Malley, who must leave as a result of term limits and appears to be strongly considering a run for president in 2016.\n\nPresident Obama, who took nearly 62 percent of the Maryland vote in 2012, has also campaigned for Brown.\n\nThe RNC and its counterpart, the Democratic Governors Association, will reportedly spend $1.5 million collectively on TV ads.\n\nAnd a political action committee for former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg has pledged to spend $500,000 on its own TV ads, to hammer Hogan\u2019s National Rifle Association endorsement.\n\nWhile national political reporters largely saw Brown\u2019s biggest liability as the failed rollout of the state\u2019s ObamaCare exchange that Brown oversaw, state Republicans have clearly made the race about taxes and have tried to convince Marylanders that a vote for Brown is a vote for a third term of tax increases.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not fear of raising taxes,\u201d said Rob Carter, former finance chairman for the Maryland Republican Party. \u201cIt\u2019s an absolute certainty.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Malley has signed into law 40 new taxes while in office, according to Forbes.com.\n\nHe signed the rain water tax bill in 2012, in response to an Environmental Protection Agency mandate on cleaning up the Chesapeake Bay. Property owners in 10 jurisdiction including Baltimore City now pay an annual fee that ranges from rough $26 to $256.\n\n\u201cAnthony Brown means eight more years of Martin O\u2019Malley,\u201d Carter said. \u201cThey are two peas in a pod.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/ELECTIONS/Gubernatorial", "dcterms.modified": "2015-02-01 08:43:58 EST", "dc.type":
