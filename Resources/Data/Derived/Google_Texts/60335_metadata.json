Jerry Brown, sitting center, surrounded by government officials, signs landmark legislation by Senate President pro Tempore Kevin De Leon, third from left, to combat climate change at a ceremony at the Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles, Oct. 7. California enacted some of the nation's most aggressive social polices this year, including de Leon's SB350 which calls for increasing the state's renewable electricity use to 50 percent and doubling energy efficiency in existing buildings by 2030.\n\nIn a jam-packed legislative session, California lawmakers enacted a sweeping range of social policies, including bills mandating equal pay to women, allowing assisted suicide for terminally-ill people, and requiring student vaccinations.\n\nThe 675 bills signed this year by Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, point to a commitment by state lawmakers to aggressively pursue a host of progressive goals \u2013 including comprehensive climate change legislation.\n\nObservers say their efforts to actively legislate on controversial issues like assisted suicide may become a model for Congress and other states frequently mired in political in-fighting, though the state has side-stepped some long-vexing economic issues.\n\nRecommended: How much do you know about California? Take our quiz.\n\n\u201cBoth the vaccine bill and the right-to-die legislation will be seriously looked at by other states,\" Sherry Bebitch-Jeffe, senior political science fellow at the University of Southern California, told the Associated Press.\u201cIf it can pass here and it is perceived to work here, I think the proponents have a big positive jolt out of the victory in California.\u201d\n\nThe state has also made strides in tackling the thorny issue of illegal immigration, moving from denying government services to undocumented workers 20 years ago to attempting to create a path to \u201cstate citizenship\u201d for them in a series of bills passed over the last few years, as The Monitor\u2019s Gloria Goodale reported.\n\nFollowing previous moves to allow undocumented immigrants to obtain drivers\u2019 licenses, pay in-state tuition rates at local colleges, and have access to financial aid traditionally denied to non-citizens, the state is now allowing undocumented minors to receive health insurance through the state\u2019s Medi-Cal program and state health exchanges established under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cCalifornia is far ahead of other states,\u201d Karthick Ramakrishnan, associate dean of the school of Public Policy at the University of California in Riverside, told The Monitor, calling the immigration proposals a model for other states and Congress.\n\n\u201cCalifornia is done waiting in vain for action on immigration from the federal government,\u201d he added.\n\nParticularly significant is the sweeping climate change legislation, which pledges to increase the state\u2019s use of renewable energy sources to 50 percent by 2030.\n\nThe bill continues the state\u2019s efforts to take the lead on environmental issues, ranging from signing a memorandum of understanding with several agencies in China to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 80 percent of their levels in 1990 to beginning a program to provide electric cars for the nation\u2019s third-largest police force in Los Angeles.\n\nBut the defeat of one key provision championed by Mr. Brown, which would have pledged to cut the state\u2019s oil use in half within 15 years, may point to a schism between the state\u2019s traditionally progressive base and a growing number of moderate Democrats and Republicans in the state capital.\n\nSeemingly unbowed by the defeat, which came after a fierce lobbying effort by the oil industry, Mr. Brown quipped, \u201cI'd say oil has won the skirmish, but they've lost the bigger battle.\u201d\n\nBusiness interests also blocked efforts to tax tobacco and oil, as lawmakers side-stepped some long-standing economic issues, such as road maintenance estimated to cost $59 billion and a $1 billion shortfall for Medi-Cal, which provides health insurance for the poor.\n\nBut several laws passed this season may provide a model for other states, including the landmark assisted suicide bill \u2013 which Mr. Brown, a lifelong Catholic, initially appear to hesitate about signing.\n\nThe state also passed a measure that would bar many people with concealed weapons permits from bringing weapons onto college campuses and a law to specifically ban the name \u201cRedskins\u201d for school sports teams.\n\n\u201cIt's the panoply of issues that California, if not in a leadership position, is always close to it,\" Larry Gerston, a professor emeritus at San Jose State University, told the AP. \u201cThe various voices are represented here much more, in more forceful ways.\u201d\n\nThis report contains
