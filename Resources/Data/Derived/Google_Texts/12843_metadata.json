Patients who use concierge medicine pay a certain amount for a more personal and accessible relationship with their doctor.\n\nConnie Weiser of Butler Township is on board with the trend and is benefiting from immediate and undivided attention from her doctor. Barry Taylor, who is Weiser\u2019s doctor, is among a growing number across the country and in the Miami Valley trying this new approach to healthcare.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a different concept. It\u2019s so nice not being a number,\u201d Weiser said. \u201cIt\u2019s great because he has all the time in the world for you now.\u201d\n\nWhile many doctors average about 2,500 patients, Weiser is one of about 400 patients who now sees Taylor. Prices range from $500 dollars for a dependent and up to $2,000 per year for a patient who is older than 50.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s peace of mind. It\u2019s like an insurance policy,\u201d said Weiser, who still needs insurance to cover special tests, hospital stays, trips to the emergency room or surgery.\n\nGoing to the hospital is something Taylor is hoping to help patients avoid.\n\n\u201cI try not to have people go to the ER,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cI can usually take care of them here in the office. Sometimes, I have to go see them.\u201d\n\nTaylor said he wanted to return to the roots of old-fashioned medicine so he started the concierge practice two years ago. He said it allows him to work at a more relaxed pace and no patient is fighting for his time.\n\n\u201cThe economic pressure on the physician is to get out of the room and move to the next patient, and that\u2019s it. So, I started this practice to get rid of that,\u201d Taylor said. He calls concierge medicine doctor heaven.\n\nHe does not take insurance and every procedure he does in his office at 105 Sugar Camp Circle, or in a patient\u2019s home, is covered under the annual premium.\n\nThis means Taylor does not have to have pay for a staff to process insurance coverage and payments.\n\n\u201cIt works beautifully. It\u2019s all out of pocket. There\u2019s no bill,\u201d Taylor said.\n\nThe purpose, he said, is to remove the insurance company from making health care decisions for the patient \u2014 at least to start.\n\nThe Association of American Physicians and Surgeons supports concierge practices, said Jane Orient, the organization\u2019s executive director.\n\nThird party insurance coverage, whether through the ACA, a plan through work, or otherwise, may triple the cost of low dollar services and the administrative burdens on processing all those claims is tremendous, Orient said.\n\n\u201cDirect care may be the only way that doctors will be able to stay in private practice or even stay in primary care,\u201d Orient said.\n\nBryan Bucklew, president of the Greater Dayton Area Hospital Association, said concierge medicine serves a health care niche in the community.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s an important niche, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the universal solution to health care access in our community,\u201d Bucklew said. \u201cMedical technology is increasing. The way providers are being paid is changing and so you are going to see different initiatives taking place and concierge medicine is one of those.\u201d\n\nBucklew said whether patients benefit will depend on each patient\u2019s circumstances.\n\n\u201cThe one thing people are going to have to do with the Affordable Health Care Act and the changes in health care, is really do some research on what\u2019s the best plan, what\u2019s the best provider,\u201d Bucklew said.\n\nAccording to the American Academy of Private Physicians, there are eight other doctors who have concierge style practices in the Miami valley, 64 total for the state of Ohio.\n\nWeiser said she has no regrets.\n\n\u201cYou can send him things before you get to the doctor\u2019s office. You can send him your questions. Or if you need him in the middle of the night, he\u2019s available. He\u2019s available on weekends,\u201d Weiser said. \u201cIt\u2019s just so comforting. You know you can rely on him to be there.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A waiting room with no wait and a doctor who answers your texts and makes house calls may seem hard to imagine in today\u2019s world full of medical billing and insurance company navigation.", "og": {"url": "http://www.daytondailynews.com/news/business/concierge-medicine-a-growing-trend-in-health-care/ngszq/", "image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2014/08/21/de/42/DDN_Facebook_Icon.png", "type": "article", "description": "A waiting room with no wait and a doctor who answers your texts and makes house calls may seem hard to imagine in today\u2019s world full of medical billing and insurance company navigation.", "title": "Concierge medicine a growing trend in health care"}, "twitter": {"title": "Concierge medicine a growing trend in health care", "site": "@daytondailynews", "card": "summary", "description": "A waiting room with no wait and a doctor who answers your texts and makes house calls may seem hard to imagine in today&rsquo;s world full of medical billing and insurance company navigation."}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "ddn", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.daytondailynews.com/news/business/concierge-medicine-a-growing-trend-in-health-care/ngszq/"}, "cmg_revpath": "/re/292/2566466/news/business/concierge-medicine-a-growing-trend-in-health-care/ngszq/", "google-site-verification": "fR8PW_DfizdYW0uymF5VkAzfbNKqKxqfnhqsbXSP7oI"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd86b2\"", "article_summary": "A new trend in health care, concierge medicine, helps patients cut through the maze of pre-approvals and insurance company reimbursements.\n\u201cThe one thing people are going to have to do with the Affordable Health Care Act and the changes in health care, is really do some research on what\u2019s the best plan, what\u2019s the best provider,\u201d Bucklew said.\nBryan Bucklew, president of the Greater Dayton Area Hospital Association, said concierge medicine serves a health care niche in the community.\nPatients who use concierge medicine pay a certain amount for a more personal and accessible relationship with their doctor.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s an important niche, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the universal solution to health care access in our community,\u201d Bucklew said."}
