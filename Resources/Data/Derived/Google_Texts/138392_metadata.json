Under the Sixth Amendment, those on trial is the United States not only have a right to a speedy and public trial, but they also have the right to be judged by a jury of their peers.\n\nBut many Americans don\u2019t take jury duty seriously. Instead they view jury service as a nuisance or inconvenience, largely due to the fact that jurors make far less than minimum wage during their time of service.\n\nServing on a federal jury service generally pays $40 per day \u2014 $5 per hour \u2014 in addition to being reimbursed for transportation and parking fees, but many states, counties and cities pay jurors much less. Houston Municipal Court, for example, pays jurors about $6 a day. Washington state and Minnesota pay jurors $10 a day, which amounts to about $1.25 per hour. However, some states like Wisconsin pay jurors $30 a day.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nPart of the reason that minimal pay for jury duty service is so concerning is that while employers cannot fire an employee for missing work while serving on a jury, they are not required to pay an employee for any work they miss. This lack of income is especially problematic for those who are paid hourly and can\u2019t afford not to be paid, since their worries about their own financial circumstances can have a direct impact on a person\u2019s right to a fair trial.\n\nConcern about how an individual is going to pay their rent or other expenses while on jury duty results in many jurors anxiously worrying about their finances and when their service will end \u2014 instead of whether or not justice will be or has been served in the case they have been asked to decide.\n\nOn its website, the group Goodbye Jury Duty wrote, \u201cForced jury service isn\u2019t just bad for jurors, it\u2019s also bad for the jury system itself.\n\n\u201cPeople who are upset about jury duty are inclined to put in minimal effort, and may even try to undermine the process or rush through it. The dislike of jury duty is so widespread that there\u2019s no way to filter out all of those people. Given that defendants\u2019 freedom or even lives may be at stake, that\u2019s a problem.\u201d\n\nFor those whose service on a jury is not a pressing financial issue, the experience can be a bit enjoyable. As Matthew Yglesias wrote for Slate,\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been called twice, and both times was happy to go. All things considered, I\u2019d much rather do my regular job day-in and day-out that [sic] do jury duty, but I do my regular job every day. I find that taking a day or two or three off every few years to go do something different is pretty fun. \u201cIs everyone else\u2019s job really so amazing that they can\u2019t bear the thought of a few days off to listen to testimony and pronounce on a verdict? I don\u2019t buy it. I feel like as a society we\u2019ve coordinated on a pointless anti-social norm that you\u2019re some kind of sucker if you\u2019re willing to just smile and do what the judge wants even though there are no really good self-interested reasons to want out.\u201d\n\nThe idea behind having one\u2019s peers decide whether or not a person is guilty of committing a crime was to ensure that a trial was fair and to act as a \u201csafeguard against unwarranted interference with the rights and liberties\u201d of the defendant.\n\nTo be chosen as a juror, one must be a U.S. citizen of at least 18 years of age and have lived in the judicial district they will be serving for at least one year. A juror has to be proficient enough in English that they would be able to complete a juror qualification form, have no disqualifying mental or physical condition, and never been convicted of a felony or currently be subject to felony charges punishable by imprisonment for more than one year.\n\nCongress has created jury duty policy as well in order to ensure that a defendant who requests to be judged by a jury of their peers are actually given a variety of persons to choose from for the final jury group. \u201cIt is the policy of the United States that all litigants in federal courts entitled to trial by jury shall have the right to grand and petit juries selected at random from a fair cross-section of the community in the district or division wherein the court convenes.\n\n\u201cIt is also the policy of the United States that all citizens shall have the opportunity to be considered for service on grand and petit juries in the district courts of the United States, and shall have an obligation to serve as jurors when called for that purpose.\u201d\n\nPotential jurors are chosen at random from a list of names that was compiled from voter registration forms and drivers licenses databases. If chosen, a juror is asked to complete a questionnaire to determine if that person is qualified to serve on a jury.\n\nImpact of financial stress on a verdict\n\nA few years ago, Bruce Watson wrote about his experience while serving on a jury:\n\n\u201cAs the trial continued into its second week, things got tougher: One member, a therapist, started to feel the hardship of lost billings, while another grew heavy-eyed as her all-night hospital residence shift bumped up against her daytime responsibilities in the courtroom. One found out that her employer was docking her pay, giving her only the $40 per day that the state of New York requires. \u201cBy the time we got to the jury room to decide the case, it seemed like most of us had an eye on the meter: After a few hours of argument, one juror joked that we might need to talk for another day before rendering a verdict. The room suddenly became very quiet as a soft voice replied \u2018For real, y\u2019all, I can\u2019t miss another day of work. \u201cWithin a few hours, we came to a decision. It\u2019s hard to determine if the economy affected our final verdict, but I wonder what the rejected jurors might have contributed to the discussion.\u201d\n\nThis financial hardship some jurors endure and the effect it has on the defendant is why some groups such as Goodbye Jury Duty argue that the current system is ineffective and needs to be revamped.\n\nThe group proposes that just like the government did with military service after the Vietnam War, U.S. citizens should be able to voluntarily enlist in serving on a jury. \u201cTo get people to sign up for jury service, they have to want to be picked for a jury. The way to make that happen is to follow the example of the military\u2019s solution to the draft, and provide incentives\u201d that would turn jury duty service into a \u201cworking vacation.\u201d\n\nIncentives the group recommends include better pay for jurors, bonuses for those who serve on trials that last for weeks, and providing childcare.\n\n\u201cBasically, it means kissing jurors\u2019 butts instead of treating jurors like dirt, as they are now,\u201d the group says.\n\nPaying jurors a fair and reasonable wage is not only viewed as a way to help ensure that jurors focus on the case, but that they actually show up.\n\nAccording to a report from the Ludwig von Mises Institute by Gary M. Galles, a professor of economics at Pepperdine University, the reason so many jurors are called for a particular case is not just about ensuring there is a diverse pool of jury candidates, but because many jurors fail to show up.\n\nGalles argued that \u201cif jurors were paid, attorneys would be pushed to use plain language rather than legalese to facilitate more efficient communication. Tighter time constraints would be imposed to force attorneys to make their points more quickly and clearly, and to avoid repetitive questions.\u201d\n\nBy paying a juror a better wage, U.S. citizens would become more educated on the law, evidence and procedure, which Galles said would likely lead to a reduction in the number of mistrials and resources that are spent on ensuring jurors understand and follow the law.\n\nThough the issue of unfair and minimal pay for jurors has been raised for years, as of now it appears the government \u2014 whether it be the federal, state, county or city level \u2014 has not shared any plans to change that anytime soon.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The civic duty many Americans are called on to perform is more than just a headache -- it\u2019s a blow to the wallet., jury duty, justice system, Sixth Amendment, trials,", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Katie Rucke", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "The civic duty many Americans are called on to perform is more than just a headache -- it\u2019s a blow to the wallet., jury duty, justice system, Sixth Amendment, trials,", "title": "The Financial Hardships Of Jury Duty", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/the-financial-hardships-of-jury-duty/170897/", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/101813_jury_16x92.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-10-19T09:14:35-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The civic duty many Americans are called on to perform is more than just a headache -- it\u2019s a blow to the wallet., jury duty, justice system, Sixth Amendment, trials,", "creator": "@katierucke", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/101813_jury_16x92.jpg", "title": "The Financial Hardships Of Jury Duty", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Front Page: National", "tag": "trials", "published_time": "2013-10-19T05:00:18-05:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-19T09:14:35-05:00"}}, "article_summary": "On its website, the group Goodbye Jury Duty wrote, \u201cForced jury service isn\u2019t just bad for jurors, it\u2019s also bad for the jury system itself.\n\u201cTo get people to sign up for jury service, they have to want to be picked for a jury.\nThe dislike of jury duty is so widespread that there\u2019s no way to filter out all of those people.\nThe Financial Hardships Of Jury DutyThe civic duty many Americans are called on to perform is more than just a headache -- it\u2019s a blow to the wallet.\n\u201cPeople who are upset about jury duty are inclined to put in minimal effort, and may even try to undermine the process or rush through it."}
