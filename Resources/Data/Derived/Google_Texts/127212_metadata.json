Some, like Maureen Swigon of Point Pleasant and Jody Abken of Brick, wore butterfly wings, colorful knee socks and decorative headbands to match their skirts.\n\n\"We like to get dressed up and do fun runs,\" 54-year-old Swigon said inside Asbury's Festhalle & Biergarten, where runners gathers before and after the race.\n\nSwigon, a second-grade teacher in Belmar, said she came out to support the Boys and Girls Clubs and the children the group serves.\n\nThe race helped raise money for the 675 Monmouth County children and teenagers who participate in the Boys and Girls Clubs. The clubs, based in Asbury Park and Red Bank, provide after-school and evening activities primarily to children from low-income, single-parent, working families who are unsupervised in the afternoons, said Mari McMahon, director of operations at the Monmouth County clubs.\n\nBuy Photo The annual Tutu 2.2 walk/ run that will benefit the Boys and Girls Clubs of Monmouth County was held along the Asbury Park Boardwalk and finished up along Lake Ave in Asbury Park on Sunday March 22,2015 (Photo: Mark R. Sullivan/Staff Photographer)\n\nLessons to fix Asbury Park schools\n\n\"We know it's a good cause,\" said Sean Tonne, a 35-year-old physical education teacher at Keansburg High School who wore pink and green tutus for the race. \"They (the Boys and Girls Clubs) help out a lot of the kids in the area.\"\n\nThe Boys and Girls Clubs depend on tens of thousands of dollars in donations each year to provide children and teenagers between the ages of 5 and 19 with childcare, after-school programs, tutoring, mentoring, dinner, recreation, college preparation and social supports, said the clubs' leadership.\n\n\"It costs us, as a club, $1,300 (per child) to fund a year of after-school programming. We charged the kids $20,\" said Douglas Eagles, executive director of the Boys and Girls Clubs of Monmouth County. \"Events like this help ensure that more kids can come to the club on a regular basis.\"\n\nKaren Charles, a member of Jersey Shore Running Club and co-founder of RunCollege who helped organize the race, said the group wanted to give back to the Boys and Girls Clubs. Between encouraging cheers to runners at the finish line, she said the tutus help draw attention to the cause.\n\n\"It's just something a little different,\" she said. \"I don't think they get as noticed\" as some of the larger charity runs.\n\nEagles said the clubs invest in children who have no safe place to go after school.\n\n\"We have a whole array of programs that wrap around these kids that we hope will empower them to overcome the challenges they face on a day to day basis,\" he said.\n\nFighting hunger so kids can thrive\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.app.com/1HlrHqQ", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "About 400 runners strapped on tutus and running shoes to benefit the Boys and Girls Clubs of Monmouth County.", "og": {"site_name": "Asbury Park Press", "description": "About 400 runners strapped on tutus and running shoes to benefit the Boys and Girls Clubs of Monmouth County.", "title": "Asbury Park tutu run benefits Monmouth Boys and Girls Clubs", "url": "http://www.app.com/story/news/local/eatontown-asbury-park/asbury-park/2015/03/22/asbury-park-tutu-run/25190285/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/app.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "About 400 runners strapped on tutus and running shoes to benefit the Boys and Girls Clubs of Monmouth County.", "creator": "@AsburyParkPress", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8e9ea25b1dedc45e6b328d4f856a01ee7925634f/c=457-0-2293-1836&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/AsburyPark/2015/03/22/B9316625688Z.1_20150322164154_000_GMCA9PLM5.1-0.jpg", "title": "Asbury Park tutu run benefits Monmouth County kids", "site": "@AsburyParkPress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600068887", "fb": {"app_id": 116172675120111}, "article": {"author": "www.facebook.com/amanda.oglesby.njpress"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "2.2 tutu run, Asbury Park, Asbury tutu run, Boys and Girls Clubs of Monmouth County, NJ, New Jersey, Asbury NJ, child poverty, Boys and Girls Clubs, Jersey Shore, NJ news, Jersey Shore news, RunCollege, Jersey Shore Running Club,"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0559\"", "article_summary": "We charged the kids $20,\" said Douglas Eagles, executive director of the Boys and Girls Clubs of Monmouth County.\nThe race helped raise money for the 675 Monmouth County children and teenagers who participate in the Boys and Girls Clubs.\n\"They (the Boys and Girls Clubs) help out a lot of the kids in the area.\"\nThe clubs, based in Asbury Park and Red Bank, provide after-school and evening activities primarily to children from low-income, single-parent, working families who are unsupervised in the afternoons, said Mari McMahon, director of operations at the Monmouth County clubs.\nSwigon, a second-grade teacher in Belmar, said she came out to support the Boys and Girls Clubs and the children the group serves."}
