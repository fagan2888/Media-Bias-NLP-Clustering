Now former employees are speaking out.\n\n\u201cI think it was by far one of the worst places that I\u2019ve worked at. It really was,\u201d Karen LeBlanc, a former nurse at Golden Living Center in Harrisburg, said.\n\n\u201cEvery week, something would come up where you feel like you should\u2019ve been able to do more, but, you couldn\u2019t,\u201d Percy LeBlanc, a former CNA at Golden Living Center in Harrisburg, said.\n\nPercy and Karen LeBlanc say they were pushed out of their jobs working for Golden Living center in Harrisburg.\n\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have to be subjected to work in a place like that,\u201d Karen said.\n\nThe LeBlancs say they were passionate and cared for patients, but demands became too costly.\n\n\u201cThese employees do work hard. Most of them work great together, help each other out, but you can only do so much with limited staff,\u201d Percy said.\n\nIn her mind, it all boils down to neglect and upset residents.\n\n\u201cPeople not being changed, people not being turned, people not being taken care of wound wise, people not getting their medicine on time. And it\u2019s not necessarily the staff who are trying their best to perform their job, it\u2019s not getting enough help to do their job, not having enough hands to take care of the person who really needs you,\u201d Karen said.\n\n\u201cIf you have one aid for 15 people those people aren\u2019t getting the care that they\u2019re paying for,\u201d Percy said.\n\nThe LeBlancs say problem\u2019s don\u2019t stop here and court documents show Golden Living centers across the state are accused of dirty deeds.\n\n\u201cIn any of the facilities I\u2019ve been at, plenty of people waiting to go to the bathroom, waiting to get bathed, sitting way too long in a brief. And they can\u2019t do anything for themselves. They can\u2019t get up, they can\u2019t walk, they can\u2019t go to the commode themselves, you see it every day,\u201d Percy said.\n\nKaren says issues go beyond mistreatment. Without oversight, most concerns are pushed to the side.\n\n\u201cThen they\u2019re rushing around and trying to make everything look good but it\u2019s not like that all year around,\u201d Karen said.\n\nThe suit could restore money to families who had loved ones staying at the facilities. We reached out to Golden Living, but they did not return our call.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\nGoogle\n\nPocket\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\nMore\n\nPinterest\n\nLike this: Like Loading...", "article_metadata": {"description": "The state attorney general\u2019s office has filed a legal action against a nursing home chain because it says the company failed to provide even\u2026", "generator": "WordPress.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=394896224", "og": {"site_name": "ABC27", "description": "The state attorney general\u2019s office has filed a legal action against a nursing home chain because it says the company failed to provide even the most basic care to residents.
