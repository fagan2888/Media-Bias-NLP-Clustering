As noted last week, fundraising and investment for emerging markets private equity is on track to match 2013 totals.\n\nThere is good reason: Emerging markets private equity returns have hovered in the low double digits, certainly nothing to sniff at considering compressed yields from bonds.\n\nAdditionally, emerging markets-focused private equity funds returned more money than they invested during 2013, the first year since 2005 in which distributions outpaced contributions, according to Cambridge.\n\nSimilar to the U.S., so-called capital calls, in which a private equity firm draws committed capital from its investors to fund a deal, declined and distributions rose during 2013 throughout emerging markets.\n\nAccording to Cambridge, emerging markets private equity firms called down some $14 billion for 2013, down $2.3 billion from 2012. Distributions increased 72% to $14.3 billion.\n\nWrite to Hillary Canada at hillary.canada@wsj.com", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Over the past decade, private equity in emerging markets hasn\u2019t generated the kind of blockbuster returns investors might expect in exchange for risk and illiquidity.", "title": "Emerging Markets: Should Investors Go Public or Private?", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2014/08/19/emerging-markets-should-investors-go-public-or-private/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-EE221_PUBLIC_P_20140819151753.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "Emerging Markets: Should Investors Go Public or Private?", "description": "Over the past decade, private equity in emerging markets hasn\u2019t generated the kind of blockbuster returns investors might expect in exchange for risk and illiquidity.", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Hillary Canada", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "Private Equity Beat Blog", "page.subsection": "Private Equity Beat", "article.summary": "Over the past decade, private equity in emerging markets hasn\u2019t generated the kind of blockbuster returns investors might expect in exchange for risk and illiquidity.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2014-08-19T19:32:10-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-138", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2014/08/19/emerging-markets-should-investors-go-public-or-private/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-PEBB-17226", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Over the past decade, private equity in emerging markets hasn\u2019t generated the kind of blockbuster returns investors might expect in exchange for risk and illiquidity.", "title": "Emerging Markets: Should Investors Go Public or Private?", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2014/08/19/emerging-markets-should-investors-go-public-or-private/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-EE221_PUBLIC_P_20140819151753.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Private Equity Beat", "article.id": "BL-PEBB-17226", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-08-19T19:32:27-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdf9e\"", "article_summary": "In the past five years, the S&P 500 has outstripped emerging markets public equities, as well as private equity in emerging and developed markets.\nHowever, for those investors craving something slightly less correlated to developed markets, private equity in emerging markets may well be the way to go, at least compared with public equities.\nAccording to Cambridge, emerging markets private equity firms called down some $14 billion for 2013, down $2.3 billion from 2012.\nEmerging markets private equity didn\u2019t experience the kind of rollercoaster that plagued their public counterparts during the first part of 2014.\nAs noted last week, fundraising and investment for emerging markets private equity is on track to match 2013 totals."}
