See more photos of last year\u2019s parade in our slideshow.\n\nIt is possible that the giant balloons at the Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving day Parade may not fly if the city experiences severe weather, New York Police Department Commissioner Raymond Kelly said during a news conference Monday.\n\nThe National Weather Service predicts a northwest wind of 18 to 23 miles per hour on Thanksgiving day, with gusts as high as 37 miles per hour. This comes after very heavy rain and winds predicted for Tuesday night into Wednesday.\n\nMr. Kelly said the balloons can be made to fly at various heights, depending on the weather.\n\n\u201cThey can be lowered all the way to the ground or a determination is made not to fly them,\u201d Mr. Kelly said.\n\nThe NYPD has assigned a sergeant to each of the balloons during the parade, Mr. Kelly said.\n\n\u201cUnless there are reports of a major storm system, the decision would be made that day,\u201d with officials at the city\u2019s Office of Emergency Management, Mr. Kelly said.\n\nMr. Kelly said past incidents are reason to be cautious about the weather. In 2005, two people were injured when an M&M balloon struck a light pole in high winds and brought part of the fixture to the ground. And in 1997, a Cat in the Hat balloon brought down part of a lamppost, injuring four people.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "It is possible that the giant balloons at the Macy's Thanksgiving day Parade may not fly if the city experiences severe weather, New York Police Department Commissioner Raymond Kelly said during a news conference Monday.", "title": "Weather Could Ground Thanksgiving Parade Balloons", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2013/11/26/weather-could-ground-thanksgiving-parade-balloons/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-AO149_nyball_G_20131126101500.jpg"}, "site": "WSJNY", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "New York", "article.headline": "Weather Could Ground Thanksgiving Parade Balloons", "description": "It is possible that the giant balloons at the Macy's Thanksgiving day Parade may not fly if the city experiences severe weather, New York Police Department Commissioner Raymond Kelly said during a news conference Monday.", "article_section": "New York", "author": "Pervaiz Shallwani", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Metropolis Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Metropolis", "article.summary": "It is possible that the giant balloons at the Macy's Thanksgiving day Parade may not fly if the city experiences severe weather, New York Police Department Commissioner Raymond Kelly said during a news conference Monday.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2013-11-26T15:35:00-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-158", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2013/11/26/weather-could-ground-thanksgiving-parade-balloons/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-METROB-19186", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "New York", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "It is possible that the giant balloons at the Macy's Thanksgiving day Parade may not fly if the city experiences severe weather, New York Police Department Commissioner Raymond Kelly said during a news conference Monday.", "title": "Weather Could Ground Thanksgiving Parade Balloons", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2013/11/26/weather-could-ground-thanksgiving-parade-balloons/", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-AO149_nyball_G_20131126101500.jpg", "height": 369}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Metropolis", "article.id": "BL-METROB-19186", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2013-11-26T18:02:13-05:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc88d\"", "article_summary": "AP Models of a new balloons \u2014 Sponge Bob Square Pants and Snoopy with Woodstock \u2014 are displayed at a preview of the Thanksgiving Day Parade on Nov. 19.\nThe NYPD has assigned a sergeant to each of the balloons during the parade, Mr. Kelly said.\nIt is possible that the giant balloons at the Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving day Parade may not fly if the city experiences severe weather, New York Police Department Commissioner Raymond Kelly said during a news conference Monday.\nMr. Kelly said the balloons can be made to fly at various heights, depending on the weather.\n\u201cThey can be lowered all the way to the ground or a determination is made not to fly them,\u201d Mr. Kelly said."}
