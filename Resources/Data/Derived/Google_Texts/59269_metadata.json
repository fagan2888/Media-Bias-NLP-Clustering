Things like this make it worth sifting through the stupid.\n\nHere are my favorites from the Estately post:\n\nFLORIDA: Alligator Wrestling / Botox / Eyebrow Piercing / Hulk Hogan / Juviderm / Lice / Mazda Miata / MDMA / Obamacare / Stand Your Ground / Swingers / Viagra / What is sarcasm? Analysis: The only thing surprising about Florida\u2019s search history is that it wasn\u2019t even weirder. MISSISSIPPI: Candy Crush / Codeine / Dog Fighting / Lose Weight / Making Crack / Tupac Is Alive / Twerking / What is Instagram? Analysis: What happens in Mississippi stays in Mississippi, and it\u2019s definitely for the best that Mississippi doesn\u2019t know how to post photos of it on Instagram. MISSOURI: Family Circus (comic) / Nelly (rapper) Analysis: Missouri\u2019s wifi must have gone out sometime in 2002 TEXAS: Are dinosaurs real? / Are zombies real? / The Bill of Rights / Boogers / Calf Implants / Can dogs talk? / Chupacrabra / Curves International (company) / Do I have herpes? / Does beer make you fat? / Government Mind Control / How to cook meth? / How to sell your soul to the Devil? / Justin Bieber (singer) / Krunk / Meth Recipes / Porn / Purple Drank / Rodeo / Snake Bites / Tacos Analysis: Texas asks a lot of questions, has a worrisome level of interest in crystal meth, and probably a sore that should be looked at by doctor, but the Lone Star State also has a boatload of tacos. So many delicious tacos OREGON: Allah / Sex / Spork Analysis: Somebody needs to go and check on Oregon. DELAWARE: Delaware, Joe Biden, What Is Delaware? Analysis: Delaware is the only state that\u2019s aware of Delaware.\n\nSpeaking as a former Texan and a present Floridian, I have to say yes and yes to both of those analyses. But to be honest, my absolute favorite is Delaware. It\u2019s so meta. Who are we? What is this place? Are we even here?\n\nIt\u2019s kind of sad that Delaware\u2019s existential crisis is being carried out via Google, though, but you know. So is mine.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.patheos.com/blogs/barefootandpregnant/2014/05/dear-god-thank-you-for-the-internet.html", "site_name": "Barefoot and Pregnant", "image": "http://wp.patheos.com.s3.amazonaws.com/blogs/barefootandpregnant/files/2014/05/estately-map.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Dear God, Thank You for the Internet"}, "com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages04.net,patheos.mkt5005.com,www.patheos.com", "robots": "noodp,noydir"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcc62\"", "article_summary": "DELAWARE: Delaware, Joe Biden, What Is Delaware?\nSo many delicious tacos OREGON: Allah / Sex / Spork Analysis: Somebody needs to go and check on Oregon.\nAnalysis: Delaware is the only state that\u2019s aware of Delaware.\nSpeaking as a former Texan and a present Floridian, I have to say yes and yes to both of those analyses.\nMISSOURI: Family Circus (comic) / Nelly (rapper) Analysis: Missouri\u2019s wifi must have gone out sometime in 2002 TEXAS: Are dinosaurs real?"}
