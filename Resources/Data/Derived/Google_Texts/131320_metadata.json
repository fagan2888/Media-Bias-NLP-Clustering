Paul LePage attended the luncheon but did not speak during the portion of the event open to the media. LePage also has a reputation for sometimes making inflammatory remarks, most recently saying at a Falmouth event that \u201c47 percent of able-bodied people in the state of Maine don\u2019t work,\u201d a comment that was quickly attacked as inaccurate and offensive by Democrats.\n\n\u201cBill O\u2019Brien and Paul LePage are perfect for each other. Ultra-extremists with a propensity for offensive remarks who their respective voters couldn\u2019t wait to vote out of office,\u201d said Maine Democratic Party Chairman Ben Grant in a statement. \u201cWith the MHPC in the room, the echo chamber of tea party talking points will be deafening, and I\u2019m sure LePage will have some new \u2018facts\u2019 to share with us after.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Brien, a Republican state representative who sat in the speaker\u2019s chair from 2010 to 2012, on Friday said his comment about Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act was about how in both laws, the federal government intruded on state rights. He said Democrats are avoiding policy and government issues by focusing on comments like his and LePage\u2019s.\n\n\u201cThe conversation that liberals want to have basically begins and ends with name-calling,\u201d he told the Bangor Daily News after Friday\u2019s luncheon.\n\nDuring his keynote address, he said, \u201cThere isn\u2019t one conservative leader in America nationally who hasn\u2019t been criticized as a bigot, a racist, a buffoon, as Islam-phobic, as a fascist. \u2026 That\u2019s a conversation that the left has. If you\u2019re going to step forward with an aggressively conservative agenda, you have to have a tough hide.\u201d\n\nThe conservative agenda O\u2019Brien pursued in New Hampshire included $1.2 billion in state spending cuts and the repeal of the so-called evergreen law, which kept public employees receiving step increases after their union contracts expired and until new contracts were in place.\n\nO\u2019Brien said he lamented that he and other New Hampshire Republicans were unable to make Maine\u2019s neighbor a \u201cright-to-work\u201d state, a measure he said both states should strive to achieve.\n\nRight-to-work legislation allows employees to work at unionized businesses or organizations without paying union dues, if they decide. Labor unions and Democrats have traditionally opposed such bills because they say they would weaken the unions, which provide important counterbalance to employer demands.\n\nTwo right-to-work bills were shot down by the Democratic-controlled Maine Legislature in the most recent session.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a reason Boeing put that [manufacturing] plant in North Charleston, [S.C.],\u201d O\u2019Brien told the Friday crowd. \u201cWe wish we had that plant. We wish we were a right-to-work state.\u201d\n\nMaine Heritage Policy Center CEO J. Scott Moody echoed that comment after the address.\n\n\u201c\u2018Right to work\u2019 is something we really need as a state to talk about if we\u2019re going to compete at a national level,\u201d he said.\n\nO\u2019Brien, Moody and others on hand Friday also trumpeted the center\u2019s Free ME initiative, which proposes to eliminate personal income, corporate income and sales taxes in the state\u2019s most economically challenged county \u2014 currently Washington County.\n\n\u201cStates provide 50 laboratories of innovation,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cI\u2019ve traveled to a lot of different states and have seen a lot of different approaches. This [Free ME initiative] is the sort of thing that\u2019s innovative and that you look for.\u201d\n\nDuring his address, O\u2019Brien said that after World War II, Maine was better off than his home state of New Hampshire. But he said the Pine Tree State lost its way by adding taxes, while the neighboring Granite State resisted.\n\n\u201cIn many ways, Maine had advantages over New Hampshire after World War II,\u201d he said. \u201cYour per capita income exceeded that of New Hampshire. You were a more prosperous state than New Hampshire. But since then, Maine and New Hampshire took off in different directions.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Brien said Maine added sales and income taxes in the 1950s and 1960s, while New Hampshire \u201cstayed with the tried and true course of limited government.\u201d\n\nNow, he said, the Granite State trumps the Pine Tree State in a range of categories. He said New Hampshire has a higher per capita income and lower rates of overall crime, high school dropouts, poverty, childhood poverty and unemployment.\n\n\u201cChoices made by legislators have long-term effects,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can either enhance the lives of our people or they can diminish the lives. In those statistics \u2014 in the double the amount of children living in poverty \u2014 are real people. Years ago, even though the legislators didn\u2019t know they were making those choices, they made the choice that their lives would be diminished in that way.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "SOUTH PORTLAND, Maine \u2014 Former New Hampshire House Speaker William O\u2019Brien told a South Portland audience Friday afternoon Maine lost its economic edge over his state after World War II, when it added cumbersome taxes and watched as the Granite State passed it by.O\u2019Brien\u2019s appearance as the keynote speaker for [...] Maine news, sports, politics and election results, and obituaries from the Bangor Daily News.", "generator": "WordPress 4.1.5", "og": {"site_name": "The Bangor Daily News", "description": "SOUTH PORTLAND, Maine \u2014 Former New Hampshire House Speaker William O\u2019Brien told a South Portland audience Friday afternoon Maine lost its economic edge over his state after World War II, when it added cumbersome taxes and watched as the Granite State passed it by.
