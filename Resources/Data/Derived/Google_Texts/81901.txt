A Republican state legislator in Arizona is continuing to press her case that President Barack Obama can be compared to Nazi leader Adolf Hitler.

State Rep. Brenda Barton (R-Payson) told the Arizona Capitol Times Monday that she believes Obama is leading the United States in the same way that Hitler led Germany. She claimed that Obama is “dictating beyond his authority,” citing Obamacare and gun control. The comments to the Times came hours after she called Obama “De Fuhrer” in a post on her Facebook page while discussing the federal government shutdown.

“Barton said Obama is leading America down a slippery slope away from a constitutional democracy toward an imperial dictatorship and the people of America should be aware. She said murdering millions of Jews, gypsies and gays wasn’t the only thing that happened in Nazi Germany, and America under Obama is looking a lot like the early days of Germany under Hitler. “It’s not just the death camps. (Hitler) started in the communities, with national health care and gun control. You better read your history. Germany started with national health care and gun control before any of that other stuff happened. And Hitler was elected by a majority of people,” she said.”
