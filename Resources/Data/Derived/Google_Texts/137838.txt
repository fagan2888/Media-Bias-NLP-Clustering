Medicaid is an odd program for Indian country. Most of us understand the IHS to be the government's fulfillment of its treaty obligations. However the agency has never been fully funded.

And many Republican states have been determined to fight the Affordable Care Act, or "Obamacare," at every turn, and that means refusing to accept Medicaid expansion (the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2012 that states could turn it down).
