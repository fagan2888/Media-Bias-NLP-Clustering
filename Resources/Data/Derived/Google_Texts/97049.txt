When June arrived last week, Mediacom cable viewers in central Illinois lost WEEK-TV Channel 25, the NBC affiliate in this market. The reason? Granite Broadcasting, that owns WEEK, wants a better deal from Mediacom and the old contract expired at the end of May.

Instead of continuing to negotiate, Granite took the blackout route, zapping WEEK along with stations in Fort Wayne, Ind. and Duluth, Minn.

Blackouts – like the one executed by Granite Broadcasting to make Mediacom’s cable customers aware of the dispute between the two parties – is becoming a frequently-used negotiating tool when it comes to settling differences between station owners and distributors.

“The Granite spokesperson and contract negotiator wants to paint the picture that Mediacom is not being reasonable – but there are hundreds of these deals we’ve successfully completed in past two years, and not one of those set a price as high as Granite’s,” said Mediacom spokeswoman Phyllis Peters, noting that Mediacom recently sent a letter to subscribers pointing out that it wasn’t the cable company’s decision to pull the plug on the station.

The blackout involving Granite and Mediacom is the seventh U.S. TV blackout caused by retransmission fee disputes this year. There have been 395 blackouts since 2010, according to the American Television Alliance.

• 107 blackouts in 2014

• 127 blackouts in 2013

• 91 blackouts in 2012

• 51 blackouts in 2011

• 12 blackouts in 2010

“By setting a price that doubles the money Granite receives each month from our customers, WEEK will become the most expensive broadcast channels in all of the 1,500 communities across the 22 states that Mediacom serves. That means our customers in Metamora or Chillicothe would be paying more for that NBC channel than our customers anywhere else in the country – yet getting the same programming (other than the local news segments),” said Peters.

I asked Peters why doesn’t Mediacom just substitute another NBC station for WEEK in this market so that viewers don’t miss special network events like Stanley Cup finals or the running of the Belmont that might see the rare Triple Crown spectacle.

The answer is FCC regulations prevent it. “We are required to deliver the signals for the specific station within the boundary of the defined market area–these boundaries follow county lines,” she said.

Reminder: for those folks within antenna range of WEEK in central Illinois, you can go back to getting the station over the air if there are special programs on NBC (ice hockey, horse racing, etc.) but that may not be an option for Mediacom viewers in more far-flung locations.
