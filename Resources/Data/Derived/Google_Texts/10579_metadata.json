Those four \u2014 Blue Cross Blue Shield of Nebraska, Coventry Health, UnitedHealthCare of the Midlands and\n\nMedica IC \u2014 also will sell policies outside the marketplace, as will about a half-dozen other insurers.\n\nCompared with 2015, the Blue Cross sample averaged an increase of 14.8 percent and the Coventry sample averaged an increase of 21.89 percent.\n\nThe sampling included monthly premiums for UnitedHealthCare and Medica IC, but did not show percentage changes for those companies because they did not participate in the marketplace last year.\n\nThe largest percentage increase in the sampling was Coventry\u2019s high-coverage policy for a 45-year-old couple in Lincoln with two children, an increase of 31.68 percent to $1,514.28 a month. But the same plan from Blue Cross would cost $1,782.10 per month.\n\nThe smallest percentage increase on the list, 12.01 percent, applied to Blue Cross\u2019 plans for a young family of four and for a 30-year-old single female in Omaha.\n\nThe most expensive policy on the list was for a 60-year-old couple in Omaha, with high-level Blue Cross coverage, for $2,094.72 a month. The cheapest was a Blue Cross policy costing $166.79 for a 22-year-old tobacco user from Scottsbluff, covering only catastrophic expenses.\n\nIndividual plans under the Affordable Care Act have benefits at different levels designated by different metals \u2014 bronze for the least benefits, with silver, gold and platinum adding more benefits.\n\nTom Gilsdorf, Blue Cross\u2019 marketing director, noted that the report\u2019s 2016 increase for Blue Cross is less than the 19.55 percent increase listed in the state\u2019s sampling for 2015. About two-thirds of Nebraskans with individual coverage are Blue Cross clients.\n\n\u201cWhile any rate increase is difficult to absorb in a family\u2019s budget, the majority of our (marketplace) customers ... receive financial assistance from the government to help pay for their plans,\u201d Gilsdorf said. He said Blue Cross\u2019 \u201csignificant market share\u201d for 2014 and 2015 served as a baseline for its 2016 rates.\n\n\u201cWhile we continue to see a lot of changes, with new carriers entering the market and at least one leaving, stabilization is starting to occur in the Nebraska market, which we view as a positive for consumers,\u201d Gilsdorf said.\n\nCoventry spokesman Rohan Hutchings said Coventry believes its products are \u201camong the most competitive in the marketplace. At the end of the day, what we believe consumers should be aware of is the final price,\u201d rather than the percentage change from one year to the next.\n\nHutchings said Conventry expects medical costs will grow between 8 percent and 10 percent for individual policy holders, and the phase-out of a government cost-sharing plan will add another 5 to 6 percent.\n\nGreg Bury, a spokesman for Medica in Minnetonka, Minnesota, said that because the company is new to Nebraska, it had to make assumptions about health care costs when it proposed its premiums for 2016. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a history of claims\u201d in Nebraska, he said, although general medical cost trends are a factor.\n\n\u201cOur approach to pricing is long-term, so that when we enter a market, we\u2019re there for a long haul and the price reflects that,\u201d Bury said. \u201cWe try to avoid huge price increases from one year to the next.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s premiums in Minnesota for 2016 will increase, on average, less than 10 percent, he said. The company will have better cost information for Nebraska when it proposes 2017 premiums.\n\nThe Kaiser Family Foundation, which researches health care costs, said increases in spending on health care have slowed in recent years to 3.6 percent in 2013, the latest year figures are available and the lowest rate since 1961.\n\nBut projected increases are due to be higher, the foundation said, estimating 4.7 percent for 2014, 4.4 percent for 2015 and predicting more than 5 percent annually from 2019 to 2014.\n\nThe federal government\u2019s latest count showed 63,380 people signed up for individual coverage through the federal marketplace in Nebraska this year, with 89 percent of them receiving tax credits to offset part of their monthly premiums. Others signed up for the same policies but not through the marketplace.\n\nOpen enrollment for the individual plans is from Nov. 1 to Jan. 31.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new sampling of 2016 health insurance premiums in Nebraska for two leading companies shows increases between 12 percent and 31 percent for individual policies, a signal that health insurance costs more broadly are headed up again next year.", "og": {"site_name": "Kearney Hub", "description": "A new sampling of 2016 health insurance premiums in Nebraska for two leading companies shows increases between 12 percent and 31 percent for individual policies, a signal that health insurance costs more broadly are headed up again next year.", "title": "Nebraska health premiums expected to rise", "url": "http://www.kearneyhub.com/medical-corner/nebraska-health-premiums-expected-to-rise/article_9c1cc40c-50c6-11e5-a603-5f47012051d8.html", "image": {"width": 675, "identifier": "http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/kearneyhub.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/e/a6/ea6de348-440b-11e4-b687-b75e70f02d04/5422f8279da5a.image.jpg?resize=675%2C400", "height": 400}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@KearneyHub", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"app_id": 409294052520309}, "keywords": "health insurance,medical-corner,regional", "news_keywords": "health insurance,medical-corner,regional"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9c83\"", "article_summary": "The Kaiser Family Foundation, which researches health care costs, said increases in spending on health care have slowed in recent years to 3.6 percent in 2013, the latest year figures are available and the lowest rate since 1961.\nA new sampling of 2016 health insurance premiums in Nebraska for two leading companies shows increases between 12 percent and 31 percent for individual policies, a signal that health insurance costs more broadly are headed up again next year.\nThose four \u2014 Blue Cross Blue Shield of Nebraska, Coventry Health, UnitedHealthCare of the Midlands andMedica IC \u2014 also will sell policies outside the marketplace, as will about a half-dozen other insurers.\nThe cheapest was a Blue Cross policy costing $166.79 for a 22-year-old tobacco user from Scottsbluff, covering only catastrophic expenses.\nTom Gilsdorf, Blue Cross\u2019 marketing director, noted that the report\u2019s 2016 increase for Blue Cross is less than the 19.55 percent increase listed in the state\u2019s sampling for 2015."}
