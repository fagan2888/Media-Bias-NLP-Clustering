Not the kind of thing that should be in ISIS's hands.\n\nThe Islamic terror group has gathered enough radioactive material from research centers and hospitals that normally only governments have access to. According to Australian foreign minister Julie Bishop, these developments have NATO very worried:\n\nThe threat of Isis\u2019s radioactive and biological weapons stockpile was so severe that the Australia Group, a 40-nation bloc dedicated to ending the use of chemical weapons, held a session on the subject at its summit in Perth last week. \u201cThis is really worrying them,\u201d Ms Bishop said in an interview with The Australian.

And given how they have a penchant for releasing videos of beheading and burning Christians, the mind cannot even begin to fathom the horrors they could unleash with a dirty bomb.\n\nBut don't worry, President Obama has a strategy for defeating ISIS!
