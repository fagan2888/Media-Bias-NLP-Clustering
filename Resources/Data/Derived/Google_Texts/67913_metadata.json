The deal ended a two-week government shutdown that McConnell terms \u201ca foolish strategy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI felt it was important to get us out of a shutdown that was overwhelmingly despised by the American people and achieved nothing toward getting rid of Obamacare,\u201d he told the Tribune-Review during an interview in his U.S. Capitol offices last week.\n\n\u201cAll Republicans would like to get rid of Obamacare, but there\u2019s a Democratic Senate and president who think it is a terrific thing.\u201d\n\nTea Party enthusiasts were as furious with McConnell over that deal as they were enthralled with Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, the face of the budget showdown.\n\nCruz forced the shutdown, against McConnell\u2019s wishes, by insisting it would bring an end to Obamacare. Democrats, who control the Senate and the White House, didn\u2019t blink.\n\nThe deal to reopen the government was less than impressive, McConnell said, but \u201cat least we didn\u2019t raise taxes.\u201d\n\nAs for the future, he vowed: \u201cThere will not be another shutdown and we are certainly not going to default on the national debt.\u201d\n\nA Born Fighter\n\nBorn in Tuscumbia, Ala., in 1942, Mitch McConnell grew up in Louisville. He learned focus and perseverance when polio struck him at age 2.\n\nHis mother directed the toddler\u2019s daily physical therapy and took him to a spa in Warm Springs, Ga., the town where President Franklin Roosevelt, another polio victim, died in 1945.\n\nAt 71, he is Kentucky\u2019s longest-serving senator, and his office reflects how important history is to him. One of its paintings is of fellow Kentuckian Henry Clay during his \u201cGreat Compromise\u201d Senate speeches of 1850; McConnell explains both the painting and the political event in great detail.\n\nClay \u2014 a former House speaker, secretary of State and part of a three-way electoral tie for president in 1824 \u2014 was known for his ability to reconcile the North and South. McConnell wrote his senior thesis in college on Clay, one of his two Senate heroes.\n\n\u201cThe other would be the late Sen. John Sherman Cooper, who I had the honor of interning for in the \u201960s,\u201d which he said \u201cdefined\u201d his career.\n\nNext year McConnell will face a Republican primary challenge from a Tea Party hopeful, Louisville investor Matt Bevin, and possibly a general election battle with Democrat Alison Grimes, Kentucky\u2019s secretary of state.\n\nBevin, 47, calls the government-shutdown compromise a \u201csellout\u201d and says McConnell \u201chas stopped being effective.\u201d\n\nBut members of both parties often underestimate McConnell\u2019s political talent and focus, said Larry Cox, who began working for him in 1981 at the end of his first term as a Jefferson County judge.\n\n\u201cI really never saw him coming,\u201d said Todd Hollenbach Sr., 73, of Louisville, whom McConnell defeated for that judgeship in 1976. A McConnell ad showed a farmer shoveling horse manure to counter Hollenbach\u2019s tax-cutting claims.\n\nSuch effective campaigning keeps McConnell in office, Hollenbach said: \u201cHis whole mode of operation has always been to raise a tremendous amount of money and use it to destroy the image of his opponent.\u201d\n\nCox counters that McConnell \u201calways knows what his goal is and sets out very methodically to get there,\u201d whether that involves winning improbable elections or Senate cloakroom battles.\n\nNot Afraid of Long Odds\n\nCox, who retired in 2010, describes the five-term senator as serious with a sharp wit, \u201ca very boisterous\u201d sports fan, an avid fly-fisherman, and \u201cvery close to all three of his daughters.\u201d (Divorced from their mother, McConnell in 1993 married Elaine Chao, the labor secretary under President George W. Bush.) He followed McConnell to the Senate in 1984 but acknowledges that he really didn\u2019t prepare to move to Washington because \u201cI\u2019m not sure even his mother thought he would win.\u201d\n\nMcConnell was down 22 points two weeks before that election, challenging incumbent Democrat Walter D. Huddleston, a minister\u2019s son in a state that rarely elected Republicans.\n\nThen came another TV ad.\n\n\u201cTen days out, we run an ad that featured a pack of bloodhounds running around looking for his opponent, who missed so many votes giving paid speeches around the country that we thought we should call him out on it,\u201d Cox recalled.\n\nUsing humorous TV spots to attack a likable opponent became part of political science, he said.\n\nIt also laid the foundation for turning Democrat-blue Kentucky a deep Republican-red, said Scott Jennings, a former McConnell Scholar at the University of Louisville.\n\nJennings, a TV reporter in Louisville when McConnell asked him to join his 2000 campaign, said long odds never deter the senator.\n\nHe hasn\u2019t always beaten such odds, however.\n\nIn 2010, he backed Kentucky Secretary of State Trey Grayson over eye surgeon Rand Paul, a political newcomer, for the state\u2019s second Senate seat. Grayson lost by 24 points to Paul, son of Texas congressman and GOP presidential hopeful Ron Paul.\n\nAfterward, liberal and conservative critics claimed McConnell was out of touch with constituents.\n\nJennings disagrees, saying McConnell helped to bridge the gap between so-called establishment Republicans and Tea Partiers. He cites McConnell\u2019s \u201ceffective partnership\u201d with Paul and Paul\u2019s recent endorsement of him.\n\nAsked to comment for this article, Paul\u2019s staff referred to the junior senator\u2019s comments last summer, when he called McConnell \u201ca proven conservative who stands strong for Kentucky in the face of President Obama\u2019s big-government agenda.\u201d\n\n\u2018Very Costly Mistake\u2019\n\nThe fate of a key item on that presidential agenda, Obamacare, depends on the 2014 midterm elections, according to McConnell.\n\n\u201cIf I am the majority leader of the Senate and not the minority leader after the next election and \u2026 if we have a president of a different persuasion (after 2016), we are going to get rid of it,\u201d he insists. \u201cThis is a very, very costly mistake.\u201d\n\nTo control the Senate, Republicans must win seven seats in 2014; experts agree they have the advantage today. Democrats must defend 21 seats, seven in states that Mitt Romney carried in the 2012 presidential election. The GOP must defend 14.\n\nYet McConnell has been here before: In 2010 and 2012, Republicans failed to win back the Senate when untested or unpolished Tea Party candidates lost what should have been easy races.\n\nCox said those results were \u201cawful\u201d for McConnell and his inner circle. Winning the majority leader\u2019s post would be a capstone to McConnell\u2019s career, he said, \u201cbut beyond that, he is deeply frustrated by the direction the president has taken the country.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Addison Mitch McConnell has made a career of following in his heroes\u2019 footsteps and vexing critics who underestimate his political skills.\nNow the Senate\u2019s top...", "title": "Mitch McConnell Calm Amid Storm | RealClearPolitics", "og": {"url": "http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2013/11/10/mitch_mcconnell_calm_amid_storm_120626.html", "image": "http://www.realclearpolitics.com/images/rcp-home-logo-ss.png", "type": "article", "description": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Addison Mitch McConnell has made a career of following in his heroes\u2019 footsteps and vexing critics who underestimate his political skills.\nNow the Senate\u2019s top...", "title": "Mitch McConnell Calm Amid Storm | RealClearPolitics"}, "twitter": {"site": "@TomBevanRCP", "card": "summary"}, "tweetmeme-title": "Mitch McConnell Calm Amid Storm | RealClearPolitics", "fb": {"app_id": 1415921935346245}, "keywords": "Election 2014,ky sen,matt bevin,Mitch McConnell,", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fced66\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThis is a very, very costly mistake.\u201dTo control the Senate, Republicans must win seven seats in 2014; experts agree they have the advantage today.\n\u201cI really never saw him coming,\u201d said Todd Hollenbach Sr., 73, of Louisville, whom McConnell defeated for that judgeship in 1976.\nJennings, a TV reporter in Louisville when McConnell asked him to join his 2000 campaign, said long odds never deter the senator.\nBy Salena Zito - November 10, 2013WASHINGTON \u2014 Addison Mitch McConnell has made a career of following in his heroes\u2019 footsteps and vexing critics who underestimate his political skills.\nCruz forced the shutdown, against McConnell\u2019s wishes, by insisting it would bring an end to Obamacare."}
