And what\u2019s worse, some will take your money even if they know there is nothing that can be done.\n\nIllinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan has had enough of the false claims and empty promises. After filing several lawsuits against student debt relief companies in the past year, she is now calling on the Education Department to step up to protect struggling borrowers.\n\nRelated: How to Really Fix Our Student Debt Crisis\n\nMadigan wants the department to create a training and certification program for credit counselors, similar to what the Department of Housing and Urban Development has for housing counselors. In that way, people having a hard time repaying student loans can find trusted advisers in their states, rather than turning to scam artists.\n\n\u201cWe must provide student loan borrowers somewhere to turn to to access legitimate information and assistance,\u201d Madigan wrote in a letter to the Education Department on Monday. \u201cThis is where Department of Education can play an important role.\u201d\n\nMadigan\u2019s request is an indictment of student loan servicers, the middlemen who collect and apply borrower payments. Companies such as Navient, Great Lakes and American Education Services are paid millions of dollars by the federal government to not only handle payments, but also answer questions and help people avoid defaulting on their loans.\n\n[There\u2019s a way to dramatically lower student debt payments, but hardly anyone use it]\n\nYet thousands of people have complained to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau about servicers providing inconsistent information, misplacing their paperwork or charging unexpected fees. These are the same sort of problems that occurred in mortgage servicing and that led to consumer protection reforms in that space.\n\n\u201cStudent loan servicers should be providing this assistance, but they are failing to adequately counsel borrowers about available options,\u201d Madigan wrote. \u201cThis vacuum of information and legitimate assistance has provided an opportunity for scammers to fill the gap.\u201d\n\nThe CFPB, the same agency that instituted changes in mortgage servicing, is now asking for public input as it decides whether similar protections are needed in the student loan market.\n\n\u201cSloppy servicing can spawn scams,\u201d said Rohit Chopra, the student loan ombudsman for the CFPB, in an interview. \u201cWhen borrowers can\u2019t get clear and accurate information from their servicer about how to avoid default, it can create the conditions for fraud. We can\u2019t make the same mistake twice. This is deja vu all over again.\u201d\n\nDebt consulting is not illegal. There are reputable companies in the market that are upfront about the limitations of their services. By law, these companies must renegotiate, settle or reduce at least one debt before collecting fees for the service. They are also not allowed to promise results that they have no way of accomplishing, such as quick relief from default or wage garnishment. Yet many companies skirt the law.\n\nRelated: Oops-White House Loses $22 Billion on Student Loan Plans\n\n\u2014\n\nIn Illinois, Madigan found companies charging upfront fees ranging between $650 to $1,250 in exchange for simply mailing out paperwork that borrowers can obtain and submit for free. These businesses were telling borrowers that they were eligible for debt forgiveness programs, but failing to inform them about the conditions to participate.\n\nIn one instance, a high school teacher paid $898 to a company after being told she qualified to have her college debt forgiven, only to learn eight months later that she did not meet the criteria. That company, Broadsword Student Advantage, is one of seven student debt relief outfits being sued by Madigan on charges of deceptive marketing and illegally charging hundreds of dollars in upfront fees to eliminate student debt.\n\nAt the federal level, the CFPB shut down student debt relief company College Education Services and separately filed a lawsuit against Student Loan Processing in December over charges of illegally charging upfront fees and deceptive marketing. At the time, the bureau issued a consumer advisory warning of signs that a company offering student loan debt relief may be a scam.\n\nPeople should avoid companies that require upfront payment, bank account information or access to their federal student aid PIN, an ID that would give a company power to take actions on a consumer\u2019s behalf. The advisory is similar to one issued by the Education Department.\n\nThere is no definitive data on student debt relief scams. But government agencies, including the Federal Trade Commission, say they have noticed a spike in complaints in the wake of the federal government\u2019s expansion of repayment options and forgiveness plans. In some cases, the same companies accused of mortgage relief fraud have reinvented themselves as student debt relief advisers, according to the FTC.\n\nRelated: 7 Tips to Help New Grads Tackle Their Student Loans\n\nDuring the housing crisis, struggling homeowners could go to the Web site of the Department of Housing and Urban Development and search for approved housing counselors to help them avoid foreclosure. There are hundreds of certified counselors who receive an estimated $47 million in support from the agency for staffing and training.\n\nIt\u2019s unknown whether the Education Department, which declined to comment on Madigan\u2019s letter, would be willing to make a similar investment for credit counselors, especially since the department already pays loan servicers $840 million for some of the same services.\n\nHUD spokesman Brian Sullivan said many of HUD\u2019s housing counselors also offer credit counseling, which means the infrastructure exists for the Education Department to partner with the housing agency. But he cautioned that having trusted advisers available hasn\u2019t stopped scam artists from trying to take advantage of vulnerable people.\n\nStill, Madigan said people need to know there are certified counselors whose advice they can rely on, especially since student loan servicers are doing a poor job of helping. She said people routinely complain to her office of servicers pressuring them into making payments, but not providing sustainable solutions for them to stay on top of their loans.\n\n\u201cAny time that you have hundreds, if not thousands of scam artists that have taken to the airwaves to tell struggling borrowers that there is free assistance available, you know there is a problem. Something isn\u2019t working,\u201d Madigan said in an interview.\n\nThis piece originally appeared in The Washington Post\n\nRead more at The Washington Post:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "You\u2019ve probably seen the commercials\u00a0or heard the radio\u00a0promos promising\u00a0to cut your s", "title": "Student Debt Scams: How One State Is Cracking Down", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/06/02/Student-Debt-Scams-How-One-State-Cracking-Down", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/student_loan.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/06/02/Student-Debt-Scams-How-One-State-Cracking-Down", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/student_loan.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "You\u2019ve probably seen the commercials\u00a0or heard the radio\u00a0promos promising\u00a0to cut your s", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3f7e\"", "article_summary": "That company, Broadsword Student Advantage, is one of seven student debt relief outfits being sued by Madigan on charges of deceptive marketing and illegally charging hundreds of dollars in upfront fees to eliminate student debt.\nThere is no definitive data on student debt relief scams.\nAt the time, the bureau issued a consumer advisory warning of signs that a company offering student loan debt relief may be a scam.\n\u201cSloppy servicing can spawn scams,\u201d said Rohit Chopra, the student loan ombudsman for the CFPB, in an interview.\nIn some cases, the same companies accused of mortgage relief fraud have reinvented themselves as student debt relief advisers, according to the FTC."}
