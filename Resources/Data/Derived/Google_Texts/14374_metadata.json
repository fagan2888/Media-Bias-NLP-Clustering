President Obama\u2019s new carbon regulations will have a punitive effect on all Missourians by raising their energy costs,\u201d said Ryan Johnson, President of the Missouri Alliance for Freedom. The EPA\u2019s so-called \u2018clean power plan\u2019 is tantamount to a federal takeover of the electrical system and a controversial scheme that will hurt every Missourian who pays an electricity bill. It is to energy what ObamaCare is to health care. We are calling on Attorney General Chris Koster to stand up and protect our citizens by taking action in the courts to stop it.\u201d\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s (EPA) plans to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from power plants (the controversial clean power plan) will do serious damage to our economy. According to a report issued by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce\u2019s Institute for 21st Century Energy, the cost to America\u2019s economy is likely to be above $50 billion a year between now and 2030. It is wrong for the federal government to arbitrarily raise the energy costs of Missourians through another executive fiat.\n\nMissouri Alliance for Freedom is conservative public interest group committed to protecting and growing individual, religious, and economic liberty throughout Missouri and holding accountable members of the state legislature through education. MAF promotes policies that encourage personal freedom and a free economy through legislative participation, grassroots organization, issue advocacy, education and training.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Missouri Times", "description": "Jefferson City, MO \u2014 Ryan Johnson, President of Missouri Alliance for Freedom, today called on Attorney General Chris Koster to join at least 15 other state attorneys general in taking action against the Obama Administration\u2019s controversial energy plan. \u201cMissouri derives 83 percent of its electricity from coal.
