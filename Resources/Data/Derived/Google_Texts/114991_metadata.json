Revealed here for the first time: the winners of the CEW Beauty Awards\n\nCan over 700 women be wrong? Most definitely not, when it comes to judging the CEW Beauty Awards 2015. That was the number of attendees at a key night in the beauty-world calendar, when CEW \u2013 the beauty industry\u2019s networking organisation \u2013 staged its product demonstration evening.\n\nIt was a chance for everyone from CEOs to beauty editors via bloggers to dip, dab, sample and listen as the experts and entrepreneurs explained the virtues of their entries. Attendees then took home a bulging goody bag \u2013 coordinated by beauty-box leader Latest in Beauty \u2013 to test and ponder their scores across 25 categories and over 300 product entries. Weeks later their votes were cast and then counted by a leading firm of accountants with a hush-hush secrecy that MI5 would be proud of.\n\nBecause who better to judge beauty classics and innovations than the industry\u2019s own? Who is most qualified to decide which brands belong in the beauty hall of fame? Who\u2019s got a more informed perspective on the beauty universe than its own movers and shakers?
