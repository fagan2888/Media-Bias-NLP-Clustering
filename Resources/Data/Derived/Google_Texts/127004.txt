Tax cheating corruptocrat Charlie Rangel is banging his “reinstate the draft” drum again.

Draft will compel Congress/public to think twice whether conflict is worth sending our bros & sis, sons & daughters to fight. — Charles Rangel (@cbrangel) September 10, 2014

Military action must be taken as an absolute last resort–& only when entire nation is fully committed to reinstating the draft. — Charles Rangel (@cbrangel) September 10, 2014

So basically Rangel is saying that 1) he and his colleagues don’t really give a damn about soldiers that aren’t part of their immediate family, and 2) nobody in Congress has children or relatives in the military.

How about we only implement Obamacare when the “entire nation” is committed to it?

OMG "@cbrangel: Military action must be taken as an absolute last resort&only when entire nation is fully committed 2 reinstating the draft" — Kathleen McKinley (@KatMcKinley) September 10, 2014

@KatMcKinley @NoahCRothman @cbrangel Oh, Rangel has been beating that 'bring back the draft' BS for over a decade now. — Brian Cates (@drawandstrike) September 10, 2014

@katmckinley He's been running this old saw for awhile (at least 2006, IIRC) 2 weaken army @ gin up oppo 2 wars @cbrangel @noahcrothman — Andrew (@sprachenZ) September 10, 2014

If there was any real chance of actually reinstating the draft, Rangel would never support doing so. He pulls this same stunt whenever there’s discussion of America taking significant military action somewhere in the world.

It’s all political theater based on the false notion that the only people in the military are uneducated people with no other opportunities.

As we remember 9/11 anniversary, we must also not forget that more than 6,600 paid ultimate sacrifice in Iraq/Afghanistan. — Charles Rangel (@cbrangel) September 10, 2014

Less than 1% are in US service. With draft America would be forced to rethink about involvement in wars. http://t.co/LoZZWZvy1r — Charles Rangel (@cbrangel) September 10, 2014

It’s all volunteer and the best military in the world. A draft would only degrade its effectiveness.
