Luis Gutierrez (D-IL)\n\nHouse Republicans passed two measures this week that purport to tackle Obama\u2019s \u201cexecutive overreach.\u201d But if passed into law, the bills would dissolve current legislation on the Affordable Care Act, education laws, and a presidential initiative that grants temporary deportation reprieve and work authorization to some undocumented immigrants.\n\nIn a 233-181 vote Wednesday, House Republicans passed the Executive Needs to Faithfully Observe and Respect Congressional Enactments of the Law Act of 2014 (ENFORCE Act), giving Congress the ability to bring civil lawsuits against the executive branch for failing to execute federal law, including making it difficult for immigration officials to exercise enforcement discretion under the presidential initiative known as the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. On Thursday afternoon, Republicans again voted through a companion bill, called the Faithful Execution of the Law Act of 2014, requiring the attorney general to report to Congress and to explain the constitutionality of all enforcement decisions made by federal agencies.\n\nDuring floor debates, Rep. Jim McGovern (D-MA) criticized the bills for being equivalent to a politically motivated \u201cpress release\u201d against the President. \u201cThis is not serious legislation,\u201d McGovern said. \u201cIt costs $24 million a week to run this place and we\u2019re wasting taxpayers dollars. \u2026 Never mind that the President is using the same kind of executive authority that President Bush and other presidents used before him.\u201d\n\nAlthough neither bill will pass the Democrat-controlled Senate and will face a presidental veto, the passage of the bills shows just how far House Republicans have come since they released a document of immigration principles a month and a half ago that would \u201cprovide an opportunity for legal residence and citizenship for those who were brought to this country as children through no fault of their own, those who know no other place as home.\u201d The bills\u2019 passage is just the latest development that proves House Republicans are less than serious about moving forward on immigration reform.\n\nRep. Bob Goodlatte (R-VA) said in a statement Wednesday, \u201cPresident Obama has refused to enforce those parts of our nation\u2019s immigration laws that are not to his political liking.\u201d\n\nThe nearly two million immigrants that the Obama administration has already deported would likely disagree with Goodlatte\u2019s assessment that the President has flagrantly disregarded immigration enforcement. As the Pew Research Fact Tank blog noted, \u201cthe Obama Administration has deported more immigrants annually than the George W. Bush Administration.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Republicans tried to push then-Attorney General Janet Reno in 1999 to suspend \u201csome deportations\u201d that \u201cwere unfair and resulted in unjustifiable hardship \u2026 we must ask why the INS pursued removal in such cases when so many other more serious cases existed.\u201d Reps. Luis Gutierrez (D-IL) and Zoe Lofgren (D-IL) presented a poster with the letter, with Gutierrez describing Smith\u2019s letter as \u201cDACA. He promulgated DACA.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "If passed into law, the bills would dissolve a presidential initiative that grants temporary deportation reprieve and work authorization to some undocumented immigrants.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "If passed into law, the bills would dissolve a presidential initiative that grants temporary deportation reprieve and work authorization to some undocumented immigrants.", "title": "House Passed Two Anti-Obama Bills That Move Backwards On Immigration Reform", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/immigration/2014/03/13/3390001/house-republicans-2-floor-votes/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Luis-Gutierrez-DACA-Republican-Support-e1394650505350.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "If passed into law, the bills would dissolve a presidential initiative that grants temporary deportation reprieve and work authorization to some undocumented immigrants.", "creator": "@EstherYuHsiLee", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Luis-Gutierrez-DACA-Republican-Support-e1394650505350-321x214.jpg", "title": "House Passed Two Anti-Obama Bills That Move Backwards On Immigration Reform", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-immigration", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Luis-Gutierrez-DACA-Republican-Support-e1394650505350.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Luis-Gutierrez-DACA-Republican-Support-e1394650505350.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-13T18:36:46+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/estheryuhsilee"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc146\"", "article_summary": "Immigration House Passed Two Anti-Obama Bills That Move Backwards On Immigration Reform CREDIT: Rep.
