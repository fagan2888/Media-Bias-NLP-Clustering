Terry Frei will be your man at Family Sports Center in Centennial while I\u2019m playing in the fifth-annual Dawg Nation Hockey Foundation golf tournament in Morrison. I\u2019ll be back working Tuesday while Terry digs in with Colorado State football.\n\nI spoke with 20-year-old defenseman Chris Bigras on Friday and right winger Mikko Rantanen, 18, on Sunday. Both Avalanche youngsters could make the Oct. 8 opening-night roster, although injuries, trade(s) or biting the salary bullet would be required. Colorado has 12 forwards on one-way deals (plus Nathan MacKinnon) and seven defensemen on big-league contracts (plus Nikita Zadorov and Brandon Gormley). MacKinnon is obviously a lock and Zadorov is a good bet to make the team out of camp. I\u2019m not sure about Gormley, who is not waiver exempt. The Avs could lose him if he\u2019s demoted to the minors.\n\nAvs coach Patrick Roy likes to carry 13 forwards and eight defensemen, so if everyone is healthy and present there is little wiggle room for young guys like Bigras and Rantanen, who could further develop in the minors.\n\nIt\u2019s a similar scenario between the pipes. What to do with Reto Berra, who will make $1.45 million this season and next? I suspect Calvin Pickard, who is on a two-way deal, will force the Avs to trade, waive or buy-out Berra. The Semyon Varlamov/Pickard combination is obviously extremely attractive.\n\nWe\u2019ll have a Rantanen story in Monday\u2019s paper. On Sunday we posed eight questions about the Avalanche heading into training camp, which begins Thursday with physicals at the Pepsi Center. The two on-ice training camp sessions are Friday and Saturday.\n\nHere\u2019s experts of my conversation with Bigras, the 32nd pick in the 2013 draft:\n\nI\u2019m sure you feel good heading into your third training camp?\n\nCB: \u201cI know what it\u2019s all about now, so I come in with a little more confidence in my game, and with the development I\u2019ve made over last season I think I\u2019m really ready to come into this camp and open some eyes.\u201d\n\nBased on contracts and the Zadorov addition there my not be room for you at the start of the year, if nothing happens with injuries or trades, so generally would you expect to start the year in San Antonio?\n\nCB: \u201cMy expectations are to come in here and make the team. I want to set that bar for myself and go from there. I want to do all I can to make the team. If it doesn\u2019t work out I\u2019ll go to San Antonio and continue to take the advise that they give me and build off that.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s your take on the addition of Zadorov?\n\nCB: \u201cI played with him a little bit in juniors when he was with the (London) Knights. Big body, likes to get physical. He\u2019ll be a force on the defense as a shutdown.\u201d\n\nI imagine you guys are going to be Avalanche teammates for a long time, but right now it\u2019s a healthy competition of who gets there first (Bigras and Zadorov are 2013 draft classmates).\n\nCB: \u201cYeah, that competition is something that every hockey player loves, and what pushes us to take that next step.\u201d\n\nIt seems like the up-and-coming D that this organization has is exciting. Would you agree?\n\nCB: \u201cI would, yeah, it\u2019s a great organization and they\u2019re taking a lot of steps to develop prospects and I think it will pay off huge. Like you said, all the D prospects are exciting.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Brandon Gormley,Calvin Pickard,Chris Bigras,Colorado Avalanche,Dawg Nation Hockey Foundation,Mikko Rantanen,Nathan MacKinnon,Nikita Zadorov,Patrick Roy,Reto Berra,Semyon Varlamov", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "All Things Avalanche", "description": "Colorado Avalanche defenseman Chris Bigras is welcoming added roster competition with Nikita Zadorov.", "title": "Chris Bigras welcomes roster competition with Nikita Zadorov", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/avs/2015/09/13/chris-bigras-welcomes-added-roster-competition-with-nikita-zadorov/22014/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/avs/files/2014/03/bigras.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Colorado Avalanche defenseman Chris Bigras is welcoming added roster competition with Nikita Zadorov.", "title": "Chris Bigras welcomes added roster competition with Nikita Zadorov", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/avs/2015/09/13/chris-bigras-welcomes-added-roster-competition-with-nikita-zadorov/22014/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/avs/files/2014/03/bigras.jpg", "creator": "@mikechambers", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "language": "en, sv", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Colorado Avalanche defenseman Chris Bigras is welcoming added roster competition with Nikita Zadorov."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd5c15\"", "article_summary": "Here\u2019s experts of my conversation with Bigras, the 32nd pick in the 2013 draft:I\u2019m sure you feel good heading into your third training camp?\nOn Sunday we posed eight questions about the Avalanche heading into training camp, which begins Thursday with physicals at the Pepsi Center.\nI spoke with 20-year-old defenseman Chris Bigras on Friday and right winger Mikko Rantanen, 18, on Sunday.\nColorado has 12 forwards on one-way deals (plus Nathan MacKinnon) and seven defensemen on big-league contracts (plus Nikita Zadorov and Brandon Gormley).\nThe two on-ice training camp sessions are Friday and Saturday."}
