This time, though, Obama went too far, even for a leftwing site like PolitiFact:\n\nObama said his JV comment \u201cwasn\u2019t specifically referring to ISIL.\u201d He was not specifically asked about Islamic State, but it\u2019s pretty clear this is the group that was being referenced in the conversation. The transcript backs this up, as do news events from the time of the discussion.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nWe rate the statement False.\n\nJust last week, Washington Post fact checker gave this same spin 4 Pinocchios when White House spokesman John Earnest tried it.\n\nSafe in the knowledge he never pays a political price for lying, just a few days later Obama was obviously confident he could repeat the \u201cJV\u201d lie to Chuck Todd.\n\nSure, the fact checkers will rate it \u201cfalse,\u201d but then the media almost always drops it. That way the media is on the record recording the lie but the next media phase, the one that never fails to bedevil Republicans, never happens: The phase where the media uses the lie to haunt the pol until he\u2019s forced to take it back.\n\nThe one exception was Obama\u2019s \u201cyou can keep your insurance\u201d lie. In that case, the media was careful not to bring that particular lie up until after ObamaCare was safely passed into law and Obama was safely reelected.\n\nJohn Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC", "article_metadata": {"description": "Fact-Checker: Obama Lied to Chuck Todd", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Fact-Checker: Obama Lied to Chuck Todd", "title": "Fact-Checker: Obama Lied to Chuck Todd - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2014/Barack-and-Michelle/obama-shrug-tan-suit-ap.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2014/09/08/fact-check-obama-lied-about-jv-remark/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Fact-Checker: Obama Lied to Chuck Todd", "creator": "@noltenc", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2014/Barack-and-Michelle/obama-shrug-tan-suit-ap.jpg", "title": "Fact-Checker: Obama Lied to Chuck Todd - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Chuck Todd, ISIS, Twitter,Big Journalism,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Journalism", "tag": "Twitter", "published_time": "2014-09-08T10:35:00-07:00", "categories": "Big Journalism"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda48c\"", "article_summary": "Safe in the knowledge he never pays a political price for lying, just a few days later Obama was obviously confident he could repeat the \u201cJV\u201d lie to Chuck Todd.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERDuring his Sunday \u201cMeet the Press\u201d appearance, President Obama brazenly lied to host Chuck Todd about his January reference to ISIS as \u201cJV.\u201d That\u2019s not my judgment, it\u2019s the judgment of PolitiFact, a site created to protect Democrats.\nIn that case, the media was careful not to bring that particular lie up until after ObamaCare was safely passed into law and Obama was safely reelected.\nSure, the fact checkers will rate it \u201cfalse,\u201d but then the media almost always drops it.\nJust last week, Washington Post fact checker gave this same spin 4 Pinocchios when White House spokesman John Earnest tried it."}
