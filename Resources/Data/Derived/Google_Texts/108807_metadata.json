Instead, the 30 subacute patients will be moved to St. John\u2019s Pleasant Valley Hospital in Camarillo, which critics say puts an unfair burden on family members who will have to travel longer distances to see their loved ones. The move is scheduled for early 2015.\n\nFor the past two years, patients and their families had been told that Goleta\u2019s subacute wing would be moved to the fourth floor of Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital at the end of a massive retrofit and renovation of the Goleta campus. On December 10, they were notified of the new agreement with St. John\u2019s. According to an internal memo from Cottage CEO Ron Werft to his employees, St. John\u2019s recently expanded its subacute capacity from 38 to 46 beds and, with a donation from Cottage, will be able to expand by an additional 25 to 50 beds.\n\nThough Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital is still a \u201cfeasible\u201d home for the subacute wing, Werft wrote, the two-story Ventura County building with easy access to gardens and patios \u201cprovides a superior living environment for subacute residents.\u201d In a press release sent out December 11, Cottage spokesperson Maria Zate noted St. John\u2019s also provides \u201csafe thoroughfares for residents and families to navigate the facility and grounds.\u201d Zate explained, \u201cWhen acute patients move into Goleta\u2019s new acute care hospital, state law prohibits the subacute unit from remaining in the existing hospital building.\u201d\n\nLompoc resident Carolina Moreno has visited her 28-year-old son Nicolas in Goleta every day for the last three years. (Nicolas overdosed on pain medication prescribed by Dr. Julio \u201cCandy Man\u201d Diaz, now facing federal charges of overprescribing to his patients, 11 of whom suffered fatal overdoses.) Moreno said if Nicolas is moved to Camarillo, she won\u2019t be able to visit him as often. \u201cI was really shocked,\u201d she said of hearing the new plan. \u201cA lot of families are having a lot of anxiety about this,\u201d she said, asking \u201cWho decides all this?\u201d Moreno speculated the decision has more to do with \u201cmoney and politics\u201d than consideration of patient care.\n\nMoreno met with Cottage administrators this week who reportedly told her the decision has been made and that she should refocus her energy on more positive efforts. She also claimed that a number of Cottage employees are similarly unhappy with the new plan but are afraid to voice their concerns for fear of professional retaliation. \u201cIf staff or employees speak out, they\u2019re treated badly,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen it; I\u2019ve heard it. It\u2019s scary.\u201d In his statement, Werft said Cottage will work with employees to \u201cidentify opportunities at St. John\u2019s and/or at Cottage Health System in the coming weeks and months.\u201d\n\nMoreno said she and other patients\u2019 families will picket outside Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital this week, attend an informational meeting with Werft on Thursday, and continue soliciting Congressmember Lois Capps for her assistance. \u201cSomebody needs to help us,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://media.independent.com/img/croppedphotos/2013/12/16/cottagemove.jpg", "description": "Families Complain Of The Long Commute To Visit Loved Ones In Camarillo.", "title": "Cottage Criticized for Planned Subacute Patient Move"}, "verify-v1": "ILofteeXjEGSBFwUf9oRyP4hdhxQ7F35jPp2MwAQrUE=", "y_key": "33d4a6dfbd23f58a", "description": "Families Complain Of The Long Commute To Visit Loved Ones In Camarillo.", "title": "Cottage Criticized for Planned Subacute Patient Move"}, "article_summary": "She also claimed that a number of Cottage employees are similarly unhappy with the new plan but are afraid to voice their concerns for fear of professional retaliation.\nOn December 10, they were notified of the new agreement with St. John\u2019s.\nTo the displeasure of a group of patients and their families, Cottage Health System administrators announced last week that a long-standing plan to relocate all of Goleta Valley Cottage Hospital\u2019s subacute patients \u2014 those with a debilitating injury or illness who require 24/7 care \u2014 to Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital has been scrapped.\nAccording to an internal memo from Cottage CEO Ron Werft to his employees, St. John\u2019s recently expanded its subacute capacity from 38 to 46 beds and, with a donation from Cottage, will be able to expand by an additional 25 to 50 beds.\nInstead, the 30 subacute patients will be moved to St. John\u2019s Pleasant Valley Hospital in Camarillo, which critics say puts an unfair burden on family members who will have to travel longer distances to see their loved ones."}
