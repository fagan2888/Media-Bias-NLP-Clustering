The latest guidance is intended to help restaurant chains understand the rules.\n\nHowever, the document often provides lengthy pieces of advice that provide little clarification.\n\nFor instance, the FDA states that a restaurant would \u201clikely not\u201d have to list calories next to a picture of a combo meal if calories are listed somewhere else on the menu.\n\nViolations of the regulation can carry a $1,000 fine or prison time. The FDA said they intend to work with state and local authorities to \u201censure that implementation and enforcement of the menu labeling requirements are uniformly applied.\u201d\n\nThe definition for \u201crestaurant-type food\u201d is lengthy, beginning with \u201cFood that is usually eaten on the premises, while walking away, or soon after arriving at another location.\u201d\n\nThe definition continues: \u201cIt may either be: (a) served in restaurants or other establishments in which food is served for immediate human consumption (such as food traditionally sold in restaurants), or sold for sale or use in such establishments (such as bulk items used to prepare restaurant foods); or (b) processed and prepared primarily in a retail establishment, ready for human consumption, of the type described in (a) of this paragraph and offered for sale to consumers but not for immediate human consumption in that establishment and not offered for sale outside that establishment.\u201d\n\nChains with 20 or more locations must comply with the regulation, and list total calories for every standard food item served. The document explains that bakeries, cafeterias, coffee shops, convenience stores, delicatessens, amusement parks, bowling alleys, movie theaters, ice cream shops, mall cookie counters, grocery stores, retail confectionary stores, and superstores also must comply.\n\nThe guidance does little to clear up its vague definition of what constitutes a menu. The document uses the same definition for menu as the final rule, which describes a \u201cmenu\u201d as any writing that \u201ccan be used by a customer to make an order selection at the time the customer views the writing.\u201d\n\nRestaurants complained that under this broad definition, television advertisements and flyers could be considered a menu. The guidance addresses this issued by stating that advertising and marketing materials \u201cgenerally\u201d would not be considered menus, but that coupons could be.\n\n\u201c[I]n the example of a pizza coupon that includes a phone number to place the order and that states \u20181 large pepperoni and sausage pizza $9.99,\u2019 the \u2018coupon\u2019 can be used by a consumer to make an order selection at the time a consumer is viewing the coupon (i.e., the coupon includes the name of the standard menu item, price of the standard menu item and a phone number where an order can be placed),\u201d the guidance stated. \u201cTherefore, in this situation, the coupon would be considered a menu (and not simply a coupon) and would be required to include a calorie declaration for the listed standard menu item.\u201d\n\nThe FDA also broadened the definition of menu to include kiosks where customers can place a made-to-order sandwich at gas station chains such as Wawa and Sheetz.\n\nThe American Pizza Community is calling for Congress to pass the Common Sense Nutrition Disclosure Act (H.R. 2017), which would give businesses more flexibility in complying with the regulation. For instance, pizza chains would be able to continue offering calorie counts for the millions of topping combinations they offer through an online resource in order to meet the regulation\u2019s requirements.\n\n\u201cThe American Pizza Community looks forward to working with Members of Congress to ensure that this legislation is passed so that we can deliver accurate calorie information to our customers in a way that is useful and fits the unique needs of small business pizza restaurants,\u201d the group said.\n\nThe guidance did clarify that federal prison cafeterias would not be subject to the rules.\n\nThe document also rules out businesses using plus or minus signs to show added calories because symbols \u201ccould be confusing to consumers.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "New federal guidance meant to help businesses comply with the Obamacare calorie posting regulation has not made the rule any less \u201ccomplex and burdensome.\u201d", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "New federal guidance meant to help businesses comply with the Obamacare calorie posting regulation has not made the rule any less \u201ccomplex and burdensome,\u201d a group critical of the regulation says.", "title": "FDA\u2019s Guidance to Help Restaurants Comply With Calorie Rule As Confusing As Ever", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/issues/fdas-guidance-to-help-restaurants-comply-with-calorie-rule-as-confusing-as-ever/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/burger-and-fries-150x150.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "New federal guidance meant to help businesses comply with the Obamacare calorie posting regulation h", "creator": "@LizWFB", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/burger-and-fries-150x150.jpg", "title": "FDA\u2019s Guidance to Help Restaurants Comply With Calorie Rule As Confusing As Ever", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd235\"", "article_summary": "BY: Follow @LizWFBNew federal guidance meant to help businesses comply with the Obamacare calorie posting regulation has not made the rule any less \u201ccomplex and burdensome,\u201d a group critical of the regulation says.\nThe latest guidance is intended to help restaurant chains understand the rules.\nThe document also rules out businesses using plus or minus signs to show added calories because symbols \u201ccould be confusing to consumers.\u201d\nThe guidance does little to clear up its vague definition of what constitutes a menu.\nThe guidance did clarify that federal prison cafeterias would not be subject to the rules."}
