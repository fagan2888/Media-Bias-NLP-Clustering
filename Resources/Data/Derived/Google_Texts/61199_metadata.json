Moments later, police said, the man shot and killed 52-year-old Frank Pascua in the casino\u2019s parking lot. Police said that following the shooting, the shooter stole someone\u2019s vehicle and fled.\n\nAuthorities had previously identified Campos' son-in-law, 25-year-old Frank Rojas, as a person of interest but have cleared him of any involvement.\n\nPolice said Pascua was a retired Bakersfield, CA, police officer.\n\nA spokesperson for Wild Horse Pass said Pascua may have tried to prevent the shooter from stealing a car.\n\n\u201c[He was] a very friendly guy. Always wanted to come over and watch football, hang out. That kind of stuff,\u201d said Kelly Ankrom, Pascua\u2019s neighbor.\n\nAnkrom said she lived across the street from Pascua and his wife in San Tan Valley.\n\n\u201cThey just came over to introduce themselves. They asked us to come over. They were barbecuing, wanted us to come over and hang out and watch TV. They had a ping pong table out front and wanted us to play ping pong,\u201d Ankrom said.\n\nAccording to a Facebook page identified as belonging to Pascua, he joined the Marines in 1981. He later spent more than six years with the Bakersfield Police Department before retiring in 2003.\n\n\u201c[The incident] must have been something really crazy because I can\u2019t imagine he would instigate anything,\u201d Ankrom said. \u201cHe seemed like a really fun, happy, loving guy. Never wanted to harm anything. I can\u2019t imagine why somebody would do that.\u201d\n\nAnyone with further information concerning this crime was asked to call Det. Vanessa Turner at 520-610-9000 or Det. Rob Hawkes at 520-610-2791.\n\nCopyright 2015 KPHO/KTVK (KPHO Broadcasting Corporation).
