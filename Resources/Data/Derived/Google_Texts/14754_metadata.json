In an interview with New Orleans City Business, a spokesperson cited competition as well as Coventry's recent acquisition by Aetna as reasons for the decision.\n\nNo one with Coventry responded to NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune's requests to talk about the matter.\n\nAnother company, Humana, plans to offer individual coverage only to those in Jefferson Parish, Department of Insurance spokeswoman Ileana Ledet said.\n\nA spokesman for Humana wouldn't confirm that plan Thursday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still in the process of finalizing agreements with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services concerning our Qualified Health Plans for uninsured individuals in Louisiana,\u201d said Mitch Lubitz, Humana\u2019s media contact for Louisiana.\n\nDepending on what is finalized, the decision could leave only two companies offering coverage to all Louisianians: Blue Cross Blue Shield of Louisiana and the new Louisiana Health Cooperative, designed to be a nonprofit, member-governed health care organization.\n\nA third, Vantage Health, plans to market its products to all but 10 Louisiana parishes.\n\nJohn Maginnis, a spokesman for Blue Cross Blue Shield of Louisiana, said the company has spent three years getting ready for the exchanges. It has hired more than 200 people and spent about $60 million in preparation.\n\nMaginnis said other companies\u2019 decisions will not affect the type of coverage Blue Cross will be able to offer.\n\n\u201cWe will certainly be ready,\u201d he said.\n\nUnless the opening of the exchanges is delayed, Oct. 1 will mark the first time people will be able to go online and shop for health insurance under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, best known as Obamacare, signed into law in 2010.\n\nThousands of Louisianians who are uninsured, who pay for their own insurance and who don\u2019t qualify for government health care through Medicare, Medicaid or another government insurance plan will be able to sign up in the new health insurance marketplace through March 2014.\n\nSuch individuals are required by law to have insurance beginning in Jan. 1, 2014, or else face the possibility of being fined.\n\nThe government will provide premium subsidies to those who live in households where the annual income is between 100 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty level.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story incorrectly described the area Vantage Health Care plans to serve. This post has been updated to reflect the company's plan to market its products to residents in all but 10 Louisiana parishes.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "health care reform,louisiana health care,louisiana medicaid", "title": "One insurer bows out of Obamacare marketplace in Louisiana", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"One insurer bows out of Obamacare marketplace in Louisiana\", \"link\": \"http://www.nola.com/health/index.ssf/2013/09/one_insurer_bows_out_of_obamac.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nola.com/home/nola-media/width620/img/health_impact/photo/13396528-standard.png\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11275271\", \"pub_date\": \"\", \"author\": \"Rebecca Catalanello, NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune\", \"tags\": [\"health care reform\",\"louisiana health care\",\"louisiana medicaid\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.nola.com/health_impact/photo/13396528-thumb_square_large.png", "creator": "@RCatNola", "site": "@nolanews", "card": "summary", "description": "One insurance company has backed out of plans to participate in Louisiana&#8217;s online health-care marketplace less than two weeks before enrollment begins Oct. 1.Coventry Health Care has withdrawn from the program, an official with the state Department of Insurance said..."}, "article_date_updated": "Monday, September 23, 2013,  4:34 PM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.nola.com/health_impact/photo/health-care-infopng-2effecf855a3952e.png\", \"author_name\": \"rcatalanello\", \"author_nickname\": \"Rebecca Catalanello, NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune\", \"author_id\": \"8224863\", \"source_blog_name\": \"New Orleans Health and Health Care\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.nola.com/health/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "NOLA.com", "description": "One insurance company has backed out of plans to participate in Louisiana&#8217;s online health-care marketplace less than two weeks before enrollment begins Oct. 1.Coventry Health Care has withdrawn from the program, an official with the state Department of Insurance said...", "title": "One insurer bows out of Obamacare marketplace in Louisiana", "url": "http://www.nola.com/health/index.ssf/2013/09/one_insurer_bows_out_of_obamac.html", "image": "http://media.nola.com/design/alpha/img/logo_nola.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NOLA.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Thursday, September 19, 2013,  4:58 PM", "article_author": "Rebecca Catalanello, NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune", "Description": "One insurance company has backed out of plans to participate in Louisiana&#8217;s online health-care marketplace less than two weeks before enrollment begins Oct. 1.
