In fact, providers and payers have already begun to redefine their traditional roles, Keckley has written previously.\n\nSuch provider-sponsored plans \"will compete against private insurers for members, but their purpose--total population health management in the communities they serve--will distinguish their ambition,\" he writes.\n\nYet the transition to integrated systems of health will hardly be easy. Private insurers argue that providers can't be trusted to manage costs and don't have the capabilities to run their own insurance plans, Keckley says.\n\nBut he points out there is a wealth of data available for employers and consumers to keep providers honest about cost control, and there's evidence that health systems can successfully integrate care financing and delivery. On such example is Kaiser Permanente, which has a payer-provider business model that's served it well since the Great Depression, Bernadette Loftus, M.D., associate executive director of the Permanente Medical Group, previously told FierceHealthPayer.\n\nTo successfully execute integrated systems, provider organizations will have to appropriate capital in different ways, physician leadership must be able to create clinical teams that embrace cost and care management, and the scale of these efforts will have to grow significantly, Keckley adds.\n\nEven if not all health systems are prepared to fully integrate financing and reform, there are other new models of collaboration between payers and providers, such as contractual network arrangements with equity investment. Provider-owned health plans also are increasing in the Affordable Care Act marketplaces, though in general they still are rare, FierceHealthcare has reported.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the post\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nNew models of collaboration emerge between payers and providers\n\nProvider-led health plans are still rare, but a growing number on insurance marketplaces\n\nFuture of healthcare will alter roles of both payers and providers\n\nHealth insurers, providers don't have to settle for 'frenemy' status\n\nConsumers, providers have trust issues with health insurers\n\nHealthcare reform expert: Next phase will be rockier than the first", "article_metadata": {"description": "As health reform continues to evolve, provider-sponsored health plans have emerged one of the most effective ways to manage care and control costs,\u00a0according to\u00a0Paul Keckley, managing director for the Navigant Center for Healthcare Research and Policy Analysis.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "As health reform continues to evolve, provider-sponsored health plans have emerged one of the most effective ways to manage care and control costs,\u00a0according to\u00a0Paul Keckley, managing director for the Navigant Center for Healthcare Research and Policy Analysis.", "title": "Provider-led health plans: The future of healthcare reform?", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/provider-led-health-plans-future-healthcare-reform/2015-12-15", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Care Delivery,care management,cost control,Integrated delivery system,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,Operations & Business Management,Paul Keckley,payer-provider collaboration,provider-led plans", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,Operations & Business Management"}, "article_summary": "Provider-owned health plans also are increasing in the Affordable Care Act marketplaces, though in general they still are rare, FierceHealthcare has reported.\nAs health reform continues to evolve, provider-sponsored health plans have emerged as one of the most effective ways to manage care and control costs, according to Paul Keckley, Ph.D., managing director for the Navigant Center for Healthcare Research and Policy Analysis.\nIn a recent blog post, Keckley explains that \"Health Reform 2.0\" will be all about cost containment, and perhaps the best way to achieve that goal is to marry healthcare financing and delivery.\nPrivate insurers argue that providers can't be trusted to manage costs and don't have the capabilities to run their own insurance plans, Keckley says.\nSuch provider-sponsored plans \"will compete against private insurers for members, but their purpose--total population health management in the communities they serve--will distinguish their ambition,\" he writes."}
