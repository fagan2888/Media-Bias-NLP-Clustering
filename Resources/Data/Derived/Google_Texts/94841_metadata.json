A full-term birth lasts 40 weeks, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). A premature birth is categorized as one that lasts under 37 weeks. In 2012, one of every nine pregnancies was a premature birth.\n\nSo what happens when a baby is born just 23 weeks into the pregnancy? A North Dakota boy arrived in this world weighing just 1 pound and 6 ounces. Trevor Frolek was so small, his father Bo could fit Trevor\u2019s foot in his wedding band.\n\nTrevor spent 345 days in the hospital but is now able to go home and enjoy the company of his family. The hospital staff at Fargo\u2019s Essential Health St. Mary's Children's Hospital had gotten so used to having Trevor and his family around that they threw him a going away party on his last day there.\n\n\u201cA lot of days we left here and were not sure we would see him again, and to see him do well,\u201d nurse Erin Kuehl said, \u201cthis is the best reward we could ask for.\"\n\nTrevor has been called a little blessing by his father and a miracle by his mother, Becky. She also said that she was nervous and excited, while hoping that she had what it takes to raise Trevor without the help of nurses and doctors.\n\nThe Froleks are expecting another child to arrive in a few short months, so Trevor and his big sister Brookelyn will have some company soon.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "north, dakota, boy, born, 4, months, early, goes, home, after, nearly, year, hospital", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A North Dakota boy who was born after 23 weeks and spent almost a year in the hospital is returning home to his family.", "title": "Boy Born 4 Months Premature Goes Home After 345 Days In The Hospital", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/north-dakota-boy-born-4-months-early-goes-home-after-nearly-year-hospital-344754", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/07/27/trevor-frolek.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A North Dakota boy who was born after 23 weeks and spent almost a year in the hospital is returning home to his family.", "title": "Boy Born 4 Months Premature Goes Home After 345 Days In The Hospital", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/north-dakota-boy-born-4-months-early-goes-home-after-nearly-year-hospital-344754", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/07/27/trevor-frolek.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/07/27/trevor-frolek.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-07-27T12:26:52-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-27T12:26:50-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A North Dakota boy who was born after 23 weeks and spent almost a year in the hospital is returning home to his family."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf8f9\"", "article_summary": "Trevor spent 345 days in the hospital but is now able to go home and enjoy the company of his family.\nA full-term birth lasts 40 weeks, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\nA North Dakota boy arrived in this world weighing just 1 pound and 6 ounces.\nThe earlier a baby is born, the more severe its health problems are likely to be.\nThe Froleks are expecting another child to arrive in a few short months, so Trevor and his big sister Brookelyn will have some company soon."}
