Wylene Gary was at the register ringing up the last of the $6.95 lunchtime specials as we chatted about her job, a modest low-paying one of the sort all too common in Mississippi, America\u2019s most down-and-out state, where a full 20 percent of the population doesn\u2019t graduate from high school, 22 percent lives in poverty\u2014and even more than that, a quarter of the state, goes without health care coverage.\n\nGary didn\u2019t have health insurance either, not that she hadn\u2019t tried. When the Affordable Care Act mandated that Americans buy coverage, she didn\u2019t want to be a lawbreaker: She had gone online to the federal government\u2019s new website, signed up and paid her first monthly premium of $129. But when her new insurance card arrived in the mail, she was flabbergasted.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cIt said $6,000 deductible and 40 percent co-pay,\u201d Gary told me, her timid drawl giving way to strident dismay. Confused, she called to speak to a representative for the insurer Magnolia Health. \u201c\u2018You tellin\u2019 me if I get a hospital bill for $100,000, I gotta pay $40,000?\u2019\u201d Gary recounted. \u201cAnd she said, \u2018Yes, ma\u2019am.\u2019\u201d\n\nNever mind that the Magnolia worker was wrong\u2014Gary\u2019s out-of-pocket costs were legally capped at $6,300. She figured that with a hospital bill that high, she would have to file bankruptcy anyway. So really, she thought, what was the point?\n\n\u201cThis ain\u2019t worth a tooth,\u201d she said.\n\nShe canceled her coverage .\n\n***\n\nThe first year of the Affordable Care Act was, by almost every measure, an unmitigated disaster in Mississippi. In a state stricken by diabetes, heart disease, obesity and the highest mortality rate in the nation, President Barack Obama\u2019s landmark health care law has barely registered, leaving the country\u2019s poorest and most segregated state trapped in a severe and intractable health care crisis.\n\n\u201cThere are wide swaths of Mississippi where the Affordable Care Act is not a reality,\u201d Conner Reeves, who led Obamacare enrollment at the University of Mississippi Medical Center, told me when we met in the state capital of Jackson. Of the nearly 300,000 people who could have gained coverage in Mississippi in the first year of enrollment, just 61,494\u2014some 20 percent\u2014did so. When all was said and done, Mississippi would be the only state in the union where the percentage of uninsured residents has gone up, not down.\n\nWhy has the law been such a flop in a state that had so much to gain from it? When I traveled across Mississippi this summer, from Delta towns to the Tennessee border to the Piney Woods to the Gulf Coast, what I found was a series of cascading problems: bumbling errors and misinformation; ignorance and disorganization; a haunting racial divide; and, above all, the unyielding ideological imperative of conservative politics. This, I found, was a story about the Tea Party and its influence over a state Republican Party in transition, where a public feud between Governor Phil Bryant and the elected insurance commissioner forced the state to shut down its own insurance marketplace, even as the Obama administration in Washington refused to step into the fray. By the time the federal government offered the required coverage on its balky HealthCare.gov website, 70 percent of Mississippians confessed they knew almost nothing about it. \u201cWe would talk to people who say, \u2018I don\u2019t want anything about Obamacare. I want the Affordable Care Act,\u2019\u201d remembered Tineciaa Harris, one of the so-called navigators trained to help Mississippians sign up for health care. \u201cAnd we\u2019d have to explain to them that it\u2019s the same thing.\u201d\n\nOpen In New Window OPTICS: Scenes from Mississippi's healthcare crisis. Photos by Jon Lowenstein/NOOR. (Click to view the gallery.)\n\nEven the law\u2019s vaunted Medicaid expansion, meant to assist those too poor to qualify for subsidized private insurance, was no help after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that states could opt out. Bryant made it clear Mississippi would not participate, leaving 138,000 low-income residents, the majority of whom are black, with no insurance options at all. And while the politics of Obamacare became increasingly toxic, the state\u2019s already financially strapped rural hospitals faced a new crisis from the law\u2019s failure to take hold: They had been banking on newly insured patients to replace the federal support for hospitals serving the uninsured, which was set to taper off as people gained coverage. Now, instead of more people getting more care in Mississippi, in many cases, they would get less.\n\n\u201cWe work hard at being last,\u201d said Roy Mitchell, the beleaguered executive director of the Mississippi Health Advocacy Program, when we met in Jackson. \u201cEven a dog knows the difference between being tripped over and being kicked.\u201d\n\nIn fact, it\u2019s hard to find a list where Mississippi doesn\u2019t rank last: Life expectancy. Per capita income. Children\u2019s literacy. \u201cMississippi\u2019s people do not fare well,\u201d wrote Willie Morris, a seventh-generation native son who grew up in Yazoo City, once a bustling trading center perched on the southern edge of the cotton-rich Delta. Today, nearly half of Yazoo City\u2019s residents live in poverty; its people, like the Delta\u2019s vast swamps, have largely been drained away, along with the farming and factory jobs that used to support them. In a state with a population that is still half rural, signs of impoverishment are everywhere: irrepressible kudzu vines pressing into the glass door of an abandoned building; tipsy wooden shacks that look neglected and forlorn are instead occupied with life. \u201cThe Depression, in fact, was not a noticeable phenomenon in the poorest state in the Union,\u201d Eudora Welty wrote of Mississippi in the 1930s. It remains the poorest state today.\n\nNone of which bodes well for health coverage in Mississippi. Small businesses that dominate the economy typically don\u2019t offer health insurance, and Mississippi\u2019s public health program for the poor is one of the most restrictive in the nation. Able-bodied adults without dependent children can\u2019t sign up for Medicaid in Mississippi, no matter how little they earn, and only parents who earn less than 23 percent of the federal poverty level\u2014some $384 a month for a family of three\u2014can enroll. As a result, one in four adult Mississippians goes without health coverage. For African-Americans, the numbers are even worse: One in three adults is uninsured.\n\nIt is difficult to untangle the state\u2019s dismal health from its past. For African-Americans, even going to a doctor can be a fraught historical act in Mississippi. There are the practical reasons that come from being poor and uninsured, but there is also a toxic legacy: the Jim Crow laws of living memory that barred blacks from most doctors\u2019 offices, the widespread practice of sterilizing black women as a form of birth control, a practice so common it became known as \u201cMississippi appendectomies.\u201d Perhaps it\u2019s no surprise then that Mississippians today are less likely than the rest of the country to seek primary care for chronic conditions and more likely to turn to hospitals when those ailments become more serious and expensive.\n\nGruesome ends await.\n\nShowdown in Jackson In Mississippi, Obamacare fell victim to infighting between two elected Republicans: insurance commissioner Mike Chaney (left) and Governor Phil Bryant (right), a Tea Party favorite. | Left: Jon Lowenstein/NOOR; right: Marianne Todd/Getty Images\n\nMississippi has the highest rate of leg amputations in America and one of the lowest rates of hemoglobin H1c testing, used to monitor and prevent diabetes complications. Amputations on African-Americans are even more startling: 4.41 per 1,000 Medicare enrollees versus 0.92 for non-blacks. The state also has high breast cancer death rates, even though it has low breast cancer incidence rates. The cancer often isn\u2019t detected until it\u2019s too late.\n\n***\n\nMississippians are all too familiar with the dirge of bleak statistics. During my travels, I often heard, \u201c We know what the rest of the country thinks of us.\u201d It would become a point of pride, then, that in 2007, Mississippi actually appeared to be leading a health race it wanted to win. That fall, a full year before Obama\u2019s election to the White House put national health care reform on the agenda, the governor, Haley Barbour, called up the newly elected state insurance commissioner, Mike Chaney, a Vietnam vet from Vicksburg. The two Republicans had been friends since college; Chaney had been the rush chairman for Sigma Alpha Epsilon at Mississippi State University when Barbour pledged the fraternity. Now, the governor had an assignment for his old friend.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018Chaney, I want you to get involved in something that the Heritage Foundation had talked about,\u2019\u201d Chaney, 70, recalled when I spoke to him at his Jackson office in June. Barbour, a folksy titan who had returned to rule over Mississippi politics after a successful career as a Washington superlobbyist and national Republican Party chairman, had enraged advocates for the poor with a series of stringent new restrictions on Medicaid.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO Magazine", "description": "How the poorest, sickest state got left behind by Obamacare.", "title": "Mississippi, Burned", "url": "http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/10/mississippi-burned-obamacare-112181.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/10/28/141029_varney_mississippi2_lowenstein.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Obamacare,Letter From ...,Healthcare,Medicaid,Letter From Mississippi,Affordable Care Act", "twitter": {"site": "@politicomag", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politicomag"}, "description": "How the poorest, sickest state got left behind by Obamacare.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd0f1\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe work hard at being last,\u201d said Roy Mitchell, the beleaguered executive director of the Mississippi Health Advocacy Program, when we met in Jackson.\n***The first year of the Affordable Care Act was, by almost every measure, an unmitigated disaster in Mississippi.\nNone of which bodes well for health coverage in Mississippi.\n\u201cThere are wide swaths of Mississippi where the Affordable Care Act is not a reality,\u201d Conner Reeves, who led Obamacare enrollment at the University of Mississippi Medical Center, told me when we met in the state capital of Jackson.\nThe two Republicans had been friends since college; Chaney had been the rush chairman for Sigma Alpha Epsilon at Mississippi State University when Barbour pledged the fraternity."}
