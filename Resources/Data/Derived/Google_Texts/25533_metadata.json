She's now against the TPP; she definitively favors a large hike in the minimum wage; and she supports expansion of Social Security. These may not seem like huge changes\u2014and they aren't\u2014but they're a lot more than most candidates accomplish. Dennis Kucinich ran twice without having any measurable effect at all on the Democratic race.\n\nNow Bernie can take credit for one more move to the left:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m also in favor of what\u2019s called the public option, so that people can buy into Medicare at a certain age,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said on Monday at a campaign event in Virginia. Mr. Sanders calls his single-payer health care plan \u201cMedicare for all.\u201d What Mrs. Clinton proposed was a sort of Medicare for more. The Medicare program covers Americans once they reach 65. Beneficiaries pay premiums to help cover the cost of their coverage, but the government pays the bulk of the bill. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s suggestion was that perhaps younger Americans, \u201cpeople 55 or 50 and up,\u201d could voluntarily pay to join the program.\n\nNow, as Nancy LeTourneau points out, this is hardly something new in the Democratic Party firmament:\n\nBack in 2009/10, Medicare buy-in was discussed as part of Obamacare \u2014 until Joe Lieberman weighed in. Given Republican obstruction at the time, health reform would not have passed unless every Democrat voted for it. One defection \u2014 ala Lieberman \u2014 was enough to end its prospects. An expansion of Medicaid combined with the option of Medicare buy-in is an incremental path towards universal coverage. That is what Democrats (with exceptions like Lieberman \u2014 who was actually for it before he was against it) have been working towards for decades.\n\nBe that as it may, this isn't something Hillary has publicly supported during this year's campaign. Until now. Why is she doing this? I'd call it a combined Bernie/Trump effect. Bernie has pushed Hillary to the left in order to win the Democratic primary and Trump has shown that it's surprisingly safe to take a more populist tone even among Republicans. This suggests that Hillary can move a bit to the left without endangering her chances in the general election.\n\nWhatever happens next, I'd say Bernie has been more successful at pushing the mainstream Democratic Party to the left than any insurgent candidate since the early 70s. He may not win the nomination, but that's not a bad legacy.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Mother Jones Magazine", "og": {"url": "http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2016/05/hillary-clinton-supports-public-option-obamacare", "type": "article", "image": "/sites/all/assets/mojo_nomaster.jpg", "site_name": "Mother Jones", "title": "Bernie Sanders has been the most influential insurgent candidate since the 70s"}, "twitter": {"creator": "kdrum", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2016/05/hillary-clinton-supports-public-option-obamacare", "image": {"src": "/sites/all/assets/mojo_nomaster.jpg", "identifier": "/sites/all/assets/mojo_nomaster.jpg"}, "title": "Bernie Sanders has been the most influential insurgent candidate since the 70s", "site": "@MotherJones", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"admins": "13301307,670317733,1198876232,38509772,106892,2907757,306289,602422192,4101301,513450539"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-150x150.png"}, "article_summary": "Mr. Sanders calls his single-payer health care plan \u201cMedicare for all.\u201d What Mrs. Clinton proposed was a sort of Medicare for more.\nWhatever happens next, I'd say Bernie has been more successful at pushing the mainstream Democratic Party to the left than any insurgent candidate since the early 70s.\nWin or lose (hint: he's going to lose), Bernie Sanders should feel pretty good about his success in pushing Hillary Clinton to the left during the primary campaign.\nThis suggests that Hillary can move a bit to the left without endangering her chances in the general election.\nBeneficiaries pay premiums to help cover the cost of their coverage, but the government pays the bulk of the bill."}
