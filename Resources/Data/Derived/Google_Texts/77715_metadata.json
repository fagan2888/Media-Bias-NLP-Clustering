Investors are complacent, with Deutsche Bank Chief U.S. Equity Strategist David Bianco (one of Wall Street\u2019s most bearish forecasters for much of 2014) now estimating we're moving into mania territory last seen in late 2007 and early 2008, based on the ratio of the price-to-earnings multiple and the CBOE Volatility Index. Valuations are high, with the Shiller cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio at levels that were only seen during the 1929 and 2000 market bubbles.\n\nBy an alternative measure, the median price-to-earnings multiple for U.S. stocks, equities have never been this expensive in the post-war era. As I'll explain below, that makes this the perfect time for smart baby boomers to cash out.\n\nRelated: 7 Quirky Economic Indicators \u2013 from Dogs to Guns\u200b\n\nUnless the global central banks have uncovered the policy equivalent of the philosopher's stone \u2014 creating wealth out of thin air \u2014 the boom will not last forever. Like death and taxes, the business cycle cannot be avoided. Economics is a social science; the study of man's propensity to make poor decisions when it comes to buying and selling, saving and borrowing.\n\nBooms lead to malinvestment, overcapacity, narrowing profits, and eventually, default and losses. It's inevitable. The movement of interest rates can control the flow but cannot stem the tide. Otherwise, monetary debasement would've saved the Roman Empire instead of precipitating its fall.\n\nThis bull market will eventually end.\n\nTiming is critical but impossible to predict. Will a Greek exit from the Eurozone trigger a crunch? What about the long awaited interest rate liftoff from the Federal Reserve? Or a Chinese debt-default problem, amid tightening margins, over-indebtedness and falling prices? How about the ongoing softness in U.S. GDP growth? Or the recent upward pressure on long-term interest rates as traders price in the rise of inflation and the potential end of the 30-year bull market in bonds?\n\nRelated: Bond Market Is Sending the Fed an Important Signal\u200b\n\nThe signs of froth are clear to those without rose colored glasses. Fed Chair Janet Yellen recently warned that stock valuations are \"quite high\" while former chairman Alan Greenspan said stocks are \"without doubt extremely overvalued.\" Mark Cuban recently explained why the current bubble \u2014 led by private investors throwing money at app developers and small tech outfits \u2014 is worse than anything seen in 2000.\n\nThe debut of money-losing IPOs is at a level not seen since the dot-com boom. CB Insights currently lists 108 U.S. startups with a valuation of $1 billion or more \u2014 most of which are nowhere near profitability. Uber's valuation soared from $17 billion to $40 billion within six months as it changes gears from taxi industry disruption to a play on autonomous vehicles. Biotech and energy sector valuations have gone orbital.\n\nFundamentals just don't seem to matter anymore.\n\nThe chart above shows how the S&P 500 has been ignoring the collapse in U.S. economic data relative to expectations. The Citigroup Economic Surprise Index has dropped to lows not seen since 2011. The Fed's policy response logic \u2014 no growth equals more cheap money \u2014 has investors hypnotized\u2026and ignoring the fact, noted by HSBC analysts, that the global economy could be headed for a new recession with central banks already at full throttle.\n\nThe Fed has had short-rates near 0 percent since 2008. Just imagine what would happen if central bankers lost their veil of omnipotence?\n\nAfter all, the cost of credit was never the problem. A lack of demand fueled by the hollowing out of middle-class wages \u2014 and the reliance on credit and asset price inflation as Americans families struggled to stay ahead \u2014 has been and remains the gist of what ails us.\n\nDemographics will bring this into sharp relief soon as boomers try to cash out for retirement and find jobless or underpaid/overindebted millennials unable or unwilling to buy their homes and their stock portfolios at current prices.\n\nThe chart above, from Yardeni Research, suggests the American \"Age Wave\" is about to withdraw as more boomers age out and the smaller Gen X cohort take their place. According to Pew Research, this is the year millennials will overtake boomers as the nation's largest living generation. The chart below, from The Wall Street Journal, sums up the problem: Millennials simply don't have the financial firepower to cash out Boomers. Not even close. The supply-demand imbalance suggests stock prices will need to fall in the years to come.\n\nThe smart money is already getting nervous, as evidenced by the recent pullback in market breadth.\n\nRelated: Why Even Rich Millennials Are Financially Insecure\n\nJason Goepfert at SentimenTrader notes that while the S&P 500 pushed to a new all-time closing high last Thursday, only 10 percent of its component stocks were trading at even a four-week high; and nearly 3 percent of its components were trading at a four-week low. The net difference of 7 percent is one of the weakest readings of the past 25 years.\n\nAll of this is coming as stocks push deeper into the weakest time of the year on a seasonal basis \u2014 \"Sell in May\" and all that \u2014 as summer approaches. Boomers, ask yourself: How much better can things get?\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Equities seem unshakeable.", "title": "Boomers, It's Time to Cash Out of This Bubble", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2015/05/26/Boomers-Its-Time-Cash-Out-Bubble", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/07082014_Stock_Market_Ticker.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2015/05/26/Boomers-Its-Time-Cash-Out-Bubble", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/07082014_Stock_Market_Ticker.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Equities seem unshakeable.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "The chart below, from The Wall Street Journal, sums up the problem: Millennials simply don't have the financial firepower to cash out Boomers.\nAs I'll explain below, that makes this the perfect time for smart baby boomers to cash out.\nAccording to Pew Research, this is the year millennials will overtake boomers as the nation's largest living generation.\nFed Chair Janet Yellen recently warned that stock valuations are \"quite high\" while former chairman Alan Greenspan said stocks are \"without doubt extremely overvalued.\"\nDemographics will bring this into sharp relief soon as boomers try to cash out for retirement and find jobless or underpaid/overindebted millennials unable or unwilling to buy their homes and their stock portfolios at current prices."}
