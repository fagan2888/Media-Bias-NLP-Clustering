Brad Paisley and Carrie Underwood are returning to host the CMA Awards together for the seventh consecutive year.

People reports that the two country music superstars are confirmed for this year’s awards show, which will air live from Nashville in November. The celebrity magazine broke the news on its Instagram account Tuesday morning (Aug. 5), using Paisley and Underwood bobblehead dolls.

41-year-old Paisley and 31-year-old Underwood have displayed a unique comedic chemistry since debuting as co-hosts in 2008. Over the years they have sung funny songs, danced, and gently made light of everything from the Nashville Flood to the Obamacare website.

Paisley is currently appearing on TV’s ‘Rising Star‘ singing competition. His new album, ‘Moonshine in the Trunk,’ is set for release on Aug. 26. He is also crossing the country on his Country Nation World Tour.

Underwood is also hard at work on a new album, which she hints is a bit of a departure.

“It’s just a progression, a different sound without losing myself in it,” she says. “I’m not taking some crazy musical departure from what I’ve done, but it definitely feels different. It will feel different, look different, sound different.”

The 2014 CMA Awards will air live from Nashville’s Brodgestone Arena on Nov. 5 at 8PM ET on ABC.
