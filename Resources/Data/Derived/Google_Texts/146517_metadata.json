Tricycle riders in particular should only ride in areas separated from cars, and when parents can keep a close eye on them.\n\n\u201cTricycles are somewhat riskier than other toys children use but that doesn\u2019t mean they are highly risky toys,\u201d said David Schwebel, a researcher at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.\n\nWhile Schwebel, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study, echoed the need for parental supervision, he also stressed that tricycles can be good for kids.\n\n\u201cTricycles are valuable tools to help children develop critical gross motor skills like balance, coordination and strength,\u201d Schwebel said by email. \u201cAny tricycle, when used carefully in a supervised situation, is likely to be a positive activity for children.\u201d\n\nSOURCE: http://bit.ly/1J7L71o Pediatrics, online September 14, 2015.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "tricycle, injury, review, highlights, need, helmets, and, elbow, pads", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Tricycle injuries often involve head wounds, elbow fractures or other upper body damage.", "title": "Study: Toddlers Aren't So Great At Driving Their Tricycles", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/tricycle-injury-review-highlights-need-helmets-and-elbow-pads-352438", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/09/14/tricycle-injuries.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Tricycle injuries often involve head wounds, elbow fractures or other upper body damage.", "title": "Study: Toddlers Aren't So Great At Driving Their Tricycles", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/tricycle-injury-review-highlights-need-helmets-and-elbow-pads-352438", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/09/14/tricycle-injuries.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/09/14/tricycle-injuries.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-09-14T12:56:30-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-14T12:56:30-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Tricycle injuries often involve head wounds, elbow fractures or other upper body damage."}, "article_summary": "(Reuters Health) - Tricycle injuries often involve head wounds, elbow fractures or other upper body damage, according to a U.S. study that suggests more children may need helmets, elbow pads and closer supervision while they ride.\nBased on the 328 tricycle injuries reported by participating hospitals in 2012 and 2013, researchers estimated that there were about 9,340 injuries nationwide during the two-year study period.\n\u201cTricycles are valuable tools to help children develop critical gross motor skills like balance, coordination and strength,\u201d Schwebel said by email.\nChildren should always wear helmets any time they are on wheels above a hard surface \u2013 including tricycles, skateboards, scooters, skates and bicycles, Smith said.\n\u201cAny tricycle, when used carefully in a supervised situation, is likely to be a positive activity for children.\u201dSOURCE: http://bit.ly/1J7L71o Pediatrics, online September 14, 2015."}
