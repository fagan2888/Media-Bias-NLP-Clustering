By filling out a March Madness bracket. By consenting to being interviewed by YouTube stars. By putting his foot on the Oval Office desk. And serial other imagined offenses.\n\nGOP CANDIDATES CLASH IN DEBATE, ATTACK TRUMP'S CREDENTIALS\n\nTwo: He demeaned Congress. By failing to meet frequently enough with House and Senate leaders. By ramming Obamacare through the legislature. By generally being arrogant.\n\nThree: He disrespected the Supreme Court \u2014 most notably by attacking the Citizens United decision in his State of the Union Address.\n\nFour: He unconscionably and probably illegally expanded executive authority. By issuing executive orders (fewer than his predecessors, but never mind that) that allow undocumented immigrants to stay in the country and strengthening enforcement of gun safety laws, among other things.\n\nFULL COVERAGE: THE 2016 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION\n\nFive: With messianic zeal, Obama built up hopes to such obscenely high levels, they were destined to be dashed.\n\nSupport for Trump by some of Obama\u2019s angriest critics makes a mockery of a sham of all these complaints.\n\nTrump, after all, is a man who boasts about the size of his genitalia, and insults a reporter by referring to her menstrual cycle, and mocks another reporter\u2019s physical disability, and repeats the word \u201cpussy\u201d from a presidential podium. He remains a reality-TV star and pageant king through and through. All that and more threatens not to diminish the Oval Office, but to douse it in in gasoline and set it on fire.\n\nTrump would govern through bullying and intimidation, and believes the definition of compromise is when people come around to his position. After winning on Super Tuesday last week, he said House Speaker Paul Ryan will have to get along with him or \u201che\u2019s going to have to pay a big price.\u201d\n\nTrump is a man who regularly lambastes Chief Justice John Roberts as a \u201cdisaster\u201d and a \u201cnightmare\u201d because he ruled in a such a way that did not advance Republican policy priorities.\n\nTrump is a man who sees other branches of government as an annoyance \u2014 and praises Obama for having \u201cled the way\u201d through using executive authority forcefully. His pledges to ban Muslims, deport millions, squelch political dissent and more would surely test and tear the bounds of presidential power.\n\nTRUMP FLIP-FLOPS ON SKILLED WORKER VISAS THREE TIMES IN DAY\n\nAnd not least, Trump is a man who has built up hopes so high, with such outlandish and impossible promises, they are destined to die violent and painful deaths.\n\nPunitive tariffs will not bring jobs back by the millions. A Muslim ban, even if it could be put into effect, will do nothing to keep America safe. Mexico will not pay for that border wall.\n\nAnd so on: Trump guarantees the sky and will deliver, at best, a painted ceiling.\n\nMillions of Trump supporters now cheer for a would-be President whose leadership style would make Obama look calm, modest and heroically responsible. Is their double-standard merely rooted in political opportunism, or is it about something else?", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Josh Greenman", "twitter": {"description": "The angriest foes of Barack Obama have had a few consistent lines of attack against the two-term President...", "title": "Josh Greenman: The Donald Trump dignity double-standard", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/dignity-double-standard-article-1.2553641", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2553640.1457141268!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/75133362.jpg", "site": "@nydailynews", "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.tags": "donald trump, barack obama, trump winning voters, super tuesday results, obamacare, obama state of the union,", "parsely-author": "Josh Greenman", "parsely-type": "article", "keywords": "donald trump, barack obama, trump winning voters, super tuesday results, obamacare, obama state of the union,", "nydn_tags": "barack obama, congress, donald trump, 2016 election, supreme court, obamacare, state of the union, immigration, super tuesday, paul ryan, religion", "news_keywords": "donald trump, barack obama, trump winning voters, super tuesday results, obamacare, obama state of the union,", "parsely-link": "http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/dignity-double-standard-article-1.2553641", "parsely-title": "Josh Greenman: The Donald Trump dignity double-standard", "sailthru.date": "2016-03-04T20:32:12-0500", "sailthru.title": "Josh Greenman: The Donald Trump dignity double-standard", "nydn_section": "Opinion", "parsely-pub-date": "2016-03-05T01:32:12", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2553640.1457141268!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/75133362.jpg", "description": "The angriest foes of Barack Obama have had a few consistent lines of attack against the two-term President...", "robots": "NOARCHIVE", "fb": {"admins": 1594068001, "app_id": 107464888913, "pages": 268914272540}, "msvalidate.01": "02916AAC0DA8B068EFE01D721E03ED7E", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NYDailyNews/"}, "sailthru.description": "The angriest foes of Barack Obama have had a few consistent lines of attack against the two-term President...", "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "parsely-section": "Opinion", "og": {"site_name": "NY Daily News", "description": "The angriest foes of Barack Obama have had a few consistent lines of attack against the two-term President...", "title": "Josh Greenman: The Donald Trump dignity double-standard", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/dignity-double-standard-article-1.2553641", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2553640.1457141268!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/75133362.jpg", "type": "article"}, "parsely-tags": "barack obama, congress, donald trump, 2016 election, supreme court, obamacare, state of the union, immigration, super tuesday, paul ryan, religion", "parsely-image-url": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2553640.1457141268!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/75133362.jpg", "p": {"domain_verify": "78efe4f5c9935744af497772f68a0ee7"}, "nydn_byline": "Josh Greenman", "sailthru.credits": "NEW YORK DAILY NEWS"}, "article_summary": "All that and more threatens not to diminish the Oval Office, but to douse it in in gasoline and set it on fire.\nBy putting his foot on the Oval Office desk.\nMillions of Trump supporters now cheer for a would-be President whose leadership style would make Obama look calm, modest and heroically responsible.\nTrump would govern through bullying and intimidation, and believes the definition of compromise is when people come around to his position.\nSupport for Trump by some of Obama\u2019s angriest critics makes a mockery of a sham of all these complaints."}
