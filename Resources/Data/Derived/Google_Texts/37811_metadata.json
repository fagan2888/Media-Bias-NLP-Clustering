Even as a freelancer, with more complicated taxes than most, it works well for me. This year, the Intuit software adds some great new features. As always, it\u2019s available in multiple versions at several price points, and it\u2019s a functional, step-by-step software just about anyone can use.\n\nNew Features for 2015\n\nTurboTax has long been one of the best-known tax-filing software companies on the internet. Since it already does a great job, it doesn\u2019t change much from year to year. However, Intuit has introduced a few useful new features recently, including:\n\nAn App: As more and more Americans move from traditional desktop and laptop computers to mobile, online software companies follow suit. TurboTax is now available on a mobile app that allows you to file your taxes on your phone.\n\nAs more and more Americans move from traditional desktop and laptop computers to mobile, online software companies follow suit. TurboTax is now available on a mobile app that allows you to file your taxes on your phone. Affordable Care Act: TurboTax always seems to be up-to-date on the latest tax laws, and that\u2019s no different with the Affordable Care Act and the related tax issues. You\u2019ll find all your health insurance forms built right into this year\u2019s software.\n\nTurboTax always seems to be up-to-date on the latest tax laws, and that\u2019s no different with the Affordable Care Act and the related tax issues. You\u2019ll find all your health insurance forms built right into this year\u2019s software. Benefit Assist: TurboTax will automatically assess whether or not you qualify for additional government benefits, such as Medicaid, Food Stamps, discounted utilities, and healthcare discounts.\n\nAlong with these recent features, I always find that TurboTax includes all the latest information I need to know for filing my taxes. And if I have questions, they have a great help center with up-to-date information on the deductions, schedules, and other issues I need to know about.\n\nThe Levels\n\nAs with most tax services, TurboTax comes with several different levels of service, depending on your needs. Some taxes are more complex to file than others, so you\u2019ll pay more for these services. Not sure what you need? Here are the basic levels TurboTax is offering in 2016:\n\nAbsolute Zero\n\nYour taxes have to be pretty simple to qualify for this level with TurboTax, but it\u2019s an excellent deal. You can file both your federal and state income taxes for free as long as you meet the following qualifications:\n\nMade less than $100,000 in 2015\n\nDon\u2019t own a home or rental property\n\nDidn\u2019t sell any investments\n\nDon\u2019t own a business or have 1099 income\n\nDon\u2019t have any major medical expenses\n\nOf course, this is very basic. However, if you meet these qualifications, this product will cover everything you need.\n\nDeluxe\n\nThis is the most common option for TurboTax customers. If you don\u2019t meet the qualifications for the Absolute Zero deal, chances are likely you\u2019ll fall into this category.\n\nBesides basic forms, this option includes Schedule A which allows you to file for various deductions and credits \u2013 including the mortgage and property tax deductions. If you qualify for the Earned Income Credit, child and dependent card credits, and other common deductions and credits, this is likely the best option for your needs.\n\nIf you\u2019re a freelancer or 1099 contractor, you may be able to get by with the Deluxe option. It allows for filing 1099-MISC forms and simple expenses, including standard vehicle mileage, cell phone expenses, and miscellaneous expenses under $100. Deluxe does not, however, cover deductions for a home office, meals, entertainment, legal and professional fees, or many other common business deductions.\n\nIn the past, I\u2019ve had to use the Home & Business version of TurboTax because I\u2019ve taken a home office and other business deductions. It costs a bit more, but I needed the help. However, this year my freelance work has moved from center-stage to side gig, so I\u2019ll take very few deductions \u2013 allowing me to use TurboTax Deluxe, instead.\n\nOne thing to note: You can always start out with a cheaper version of TurboTax and bump yourself up later if you need to. If the version you start using doesn\u2019t have all the features you need, you can upgrade to the next version. Since you don\u2019t pay until you actually hit \u201cfile,\u201d this isn\u2019t an issue.\n\nRight now, the Deluxe option is $34.99, though the regular price is $54.99. File early to take advantage of the discount price!\n\nPremier\n\nIf you\u2019ve followed Dough Roller\u2019s advice and invested heavily this year, TurboTax Premier may be the software you need. This option covers everything included in Deluxe, but it also covers Schedules D and E.\n\nSchedule D is used for stocks, bonds, ESPPs, and other investment income. This schedule in TurboTax automatically imports investment income, including cost basis, which makes your tax filing life much simpler.\n\nSchedule E is used to record income and expenses related to rental properties. If you\u2019re a landlord, this is the option you want.\n\nPremier is currently priced at $54.99, but is regularly $79.99.\n\nHome & Business\n\nIf you run a larger business or have employees, you\u2019re out of luck with TurboTax and most other tax filing software. You\u2019ll need a real accountant to make sure your taxes are filed properly. But for a small business owner or sole proprietor, the Home & Business version may include everything you need.\n\nThis version includes everything in the Premier version, and adds Schedule C, where you report self-employment and small business income and expenses. This schedule will work even if you have relatively large expenses or are dealing with asset depreciation. The asset depreciation function is especially nice, as I found when using this version of TurboTax the last few years to depreciate some of the tech I use for freelancing.\n\nThe regular price of TurboTax Home & Business is $104.99, but you can get it for $79.99 right now.\n\nAdditional Benefits\n\nEach level of TurboTax gives you access to additional tax forms, custom prompts, and fill-in-the-blanks to assist you in filing those forms. But all versions also come with additional benefits, including:\n\nW-2 Auto Fill: If you work for a relatively large employer, chances are that TurboTax can find your W-2 information for you automatically. This doesn\u2019t work with every employer, but it is handy for some.\n\nIf you work for a relatively large employer, chances are that TurboTax can find your W-2 information for you automatically.

Typically, you can e-file both your federal and state taxes, though filing state taxes may cost more.\n\nE-filing keeps you out of the super-long post office line in early April, and may get you a refund faster, too.

This is handy if you want to fill them out a bit at a time, rather than in one sitting. It also makes it easy to print off additional copies of your tax returns if you\u2019re buying a home or filling out other major paperwork in the coming years.\n\nAdditional benefits for the paid levels of TurboTax include:\n\nExplainWhy: These pop-ups within the TurboTax software show you \u201cwhy\u201d certain things are the way they are when you file your taxes.\n\nThese pop-ups within the TurboTax software show you \u201cwhy\u201d certain things are the way they are when you file your taxes.

This can be helpful if you have a more interesting question that isn\u2019t answered in the robust community forums on the TurboTax site.\n\nA Walk Through\n\nOne thing I\u2019ve always liked about using TurboTax is its interface. It\u2019s clean and easy to use, plus it walks you through each part the process step-by-step. For me, TurboTax has always provided the right level of support without being too in-my-face with tips, tricks, and tutorials.\n\nFor instance, if you sit down to do your taxes all at once, you can walk through each step of the process in the order TurboTax gives it to you. It\u2019s intuitive and makes sense. For me, though, I often take steps out of order \u2013 filing various W-2s and 1099s as they come in. It\u2019s easy to skip around to the steps you want to work on, and TurboTax won\u2019t let you file without at least checking on each step.\n\nThis year, the interface of the Home & Business version, which I\u2019m using, looks a bit different. Last year, the various tabs were on the left of the screen. Now they\u2019re on top, like this:\n\nThis holds true for the individual sections, too. Here\u2019s what the personal section looks like this year:\n\nAs I noted before, the software will walk you through every single step, or allow you to explore on your own. It\u2019ll give you this option each time you log in to start a new session.\n\nIf you\u2019re filing a little at a time, you might start by exploring on your own. Fill in information for the forms that you have. Then when you\u2019re ready to complete your filing, let the software walk you through everything to ensure you aren\u2019t missing any critical information or potential deductions.\n\nOne of the best parts about using TurboTax multiple years in a row is that it will import much of your information from prior years. For instance, I won\u2019t have to fill out much personal information this year. I\u2019ll just double check it and call it done.\n\nTurboTax won\u2019t automatically pull information for all of these W-2 forms and 1099s. However, it\u2019ll fill in the basic employer information, including name and EIN, so that I just have to add this year\u2019s numbers. It\u2019s a nice time-saver.\n\nFor instance, the software will automatically pull the EIN from last year\u2019s W-2s that will still apply for 2015. It walks me through each W-2 and 1099 form that still applies, which helps streamline the process of filing taxes.\n\nBasically, the whole experience with TurboTax looks similar to this. You\u2019ll be asked for information on each page. If you can\u2019t find the information, it\u2019ll tell you which box to look at on each tax form page. Then, the software will step you through each question to fill out each part of your taxes.\n\nSometimes, TurboTax preempts issues in the language of the questions. To be thorough, they have to be sure to ask everything, even some questions that seem silly or irrelevant, like this one:\n\nI like that they clarify the issue at stake as part of the question, since it does seem silly to ask if my four-year-old is self-supporting.\n\nNow, we\u2019ll look at a few of the interesting additions for this year, including healthcare.\n\nItems of Note\n\nHealthcare\n\nSince every American is supposed to have been insured in 2015, you\u2019ll need to fill out information about your healthcare using this part of the form. Here\u2019s where it starts:\n\nIf you answer that one or more family member was insured for only part of the year, it\u2019ll ask which months you were insured. You just click the boxes to mark the months you were insured:\n\nThen, the interface will tell you whether or not you will owe a penalty for not being insured.\n\nDeduction Estimates\n\nCurious about what kind of deductions you might be looking at this year? Check out the deduction estimator at the beginning of the deductions section. It\u2019s pretty simple.\n\nStep 1:\n\nStep 2:\n\nClearly, that\u2019s a pretty big range. So this isn\u2019t all that useful, but it\u2019s an interesting two-second estimate.\n\nIf you decide to walk through deductions on your own, you\u2019ll see a screen like this. In fact, any time you choose to walk through the steps on your own, you\u2019ll come to a similar screen that will let you pick and choose which topics you want to deal with.\n\nAudit Defense\n\nOnce you\u2019re done with your taxes, you can run an audit check. It\u2019ll basically tell you the likelihood that you\u2019ll be audited, based on red flags in your filing.\n\nWhat happens if you are audited?\n\nYou can get some free help from TurboTax support, including information on notices, letters to write, and what to do next. The Audit Support Center includes lots of information for a DIY approach to handling an IRS audit.\n\nTurboTax also offers paid Audit Defense support. If you\u2019re audited, you\u2019ll be assigned a professional who will:\n\nDefend your return from audits for up to 7 years\n\nSchedule and attend all audit appointments\n\nReview your return for other possible issues\n\nHandle all the audit correspondence\n\nAssist with letters and notices you need to comply with\n\nIf your audit risk is high, you might consider purchasing the Audit Defense support, just in case.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe bottom line here is that TurboTax has managed to come up with a great, user-friendly tax-filing software yet again. With the various levels of service available, it can work for nearly anyone.\n\nNot sure which level you need? Start with the most basic option and work your way up as needed. Since you don\u2019t pay until you actually file, you can always upgrade. Downgrading is often more difficult, though, so it\u2019s best to start with a more affordable option than you think you need. That way, you don\u2019t wind up accidentally paying for services you don\u2019t really need.\n\nAs always, be sure you follow each step in the process and have TurboTax double check for holes you forgot to fill out. And if you have questions, ask. Get help from the support available through TurboTax, or take your taxes to a professional who will file them in person if things get really complicated. It\u2019s better to pay a bit more to file your taxes on the front end than it is to risk a gross overpayment or an audit!\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "With easy to follow instructions and a user friendly interface, TurboTax is a great way to file almost any type of income tax return.
