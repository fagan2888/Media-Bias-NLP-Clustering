Joyce Ann Brown, a longtime advocate for people who are wrongly imprisoned, died early Saturday morning. Her daughter, Koquice Spencer, said her mother had suffered a massive heart attack and stroke on Tuesday. Brown was being treated at Methodist Charlton Medical Center in Dallas. She was 68.

Brown spent more than nine years in prison on an aggravated robbery conviction that was later overturned and eventually erased from her record.

She founded the prisoner advocacy group MASS, Mothers/Fathers for the Advancement of Social Systems. She was an assistant for and friend of Dallas County Commissioner John Wiley Price. She also wrote a book called Justice Denied and was profiled by the television show 60 Minutes.

Funeral arrangements are pending.
