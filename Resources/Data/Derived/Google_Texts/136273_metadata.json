Steve Scalise (R-La.), chairman of the Republican Study Committee, told reporters that he fired Paul Teller, the RSC executive director, because he no longer had the \u201ctrust\u201d of lawmakers. \u201cWe all rely on staff, but we have to have the full trust of our staff. Unfortunately, that\u2019s no longer the case,\u201d Scalise said. Teller did not respond to an e-mail seeking comment.\n\nAccording to GOP aides familiar with the decision, the ouster came after Scalise learned this week that Teller had been working with outside conservative groups against the two-year budget deal that House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Senate Budget Committee Chairman Patty Murray (D-Wash.) unveiled Tuesday night.\n\nScalise remains undecided on the matter, but large numbers of the RSC (representing more than 160 Republicans) are expected to support the legislation, while a large bloc is expected to oppose it. The legislation would increase the spending limit for federal agencies by about $63 billion over the next two years, offset by spending cuts and increased fees of $85 billion over the next decade.\n\nSome conservatives, such as Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), Teller\u2019s former boss as the RSC chairman in 2011 and 2012, oppose the deal for going above those spending limits without getting a broad reform of entitlement programs. Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Tex.), a veteran RSC member, described it as a \u201csolid agreement\u201d because the savings offsetting the increased spending are legitimate. \u201cThe more I dig into it, the better it gets,\u201d Brady said.\n\nJordan called Teller a \u201cgood guy\u201d but said that his firing was justified. \u201cI completely support the chairman,\u201d he said of Scalise\u2019s move. Scalise sought and received the support of all the former chairmen of the powerful caucus in pushing Teller out.\n\nOne GOP aide familiar with the decision said that Teller had even worked with outside conservative groups to get them to pressure a few dozen of the most conservative Republicans not to support a \u201cclean\u201d funding resolution at the minimum level for the rest of the year \u2014 believing that doing so would provide full funding for President Obama\u2019s health-care law for the remainder of the fiscal year.\n\nAlmost every member of the RSC has given up on the effort to defund the Affordable Care Act, a plan that they originally pushed in the fall that led to the 16-day shutdown of the federal government in October. Teller did not want to give up that fight.\n\nThis was not Teller\u2019s first clash with RSC members. In late July 2011, as GOP leaders tried to craft an alternative plan to lift the debt ceiling, one of Teller\u2019s aides e-mailed conservative groups asking them to send statements to the Capitol \u201cevery hour of the day\u201d in opposition to the plan. Rank-and-file Republicans were furious and at one point chanted \u201cfire him\u201d about Teller in a meeting.\n\n\u201cWhen I ran, I ran to restore the RSC as a member-driven organization,\u201d Scalise said Wednesday, explaining his decision.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rep.
