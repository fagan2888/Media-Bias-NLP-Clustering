Donald Trump’s campaign is premised on its own success, that he’s a winner and as president that success will continue, but he never explains how, Charles Krauthammer said tonight.

“He never actually says, how are we going to defeat ISIS?” Krauthammer noted on Tuesday’s Special Report on Fox News. “Well he can’t say because you don’t want to tell the enemy what your strategy is going to be.”

“He was asked on health care — I think by Hannity or somebody a few months ago — ‘what are you going to do with ObamaCare?’” Krauthammer continued. “He said, ‘We’re going to get rid of ObamaCare and we’re going to replace it with something really terrific’; now why didn’t we think about that?! You can’t ask him what exactly will be in this really terrific alternative, because he doesn’t know.”

“The premise of the campaign — I’m a winner, you give me any issue I’ll be so good, I’ll be the biggest jobs creator that God has ever created, et cetera, et cetera — it’s a promise of success, without any explanation of how,” he said. ”Now that that defies the laws of political gravity, but it obviously is working.”
