Khalid is a father of three and the grandfather of Rema, a quiet 3-year-old. Shahrazad, Khalid\u2019s wife, speaks with warmth and intelligence, and when I visited on a January morning, she offered me cookies and hot chocolate almost immediately. She introduced me to Ayad, her 35-year-old son with autism, who is unable to communicate.\n\nThey\u2019re here to give their children and grandchildren a new chance at a fulfilling, educated life. They also hope to secure the help for Ayad that they could never have found in their home country.\n\n\u201cDoctors didn\u2019t know what to do,\u201d said Shahrazad, who worked as a dentist in Iraq. \u201cEven doctors didn\u2019t know the word autism. There really weren\u2019t any psychologists there. They said that America was the best place for this kind of thing.\u201d\n\nRema, Baan (center), and Ayad (right) Al Alawi in their new home in Lakewood, a suburb on Cleveland's west side. Lecia Bushak\n\nThroughout the hour that I spoke with the family, Ayad sat quietly in his chair; he stared at the wall in front of him, and never said a thing. But he was always smiling. His parents explained that he doesn\u2019t talk unless he\u2019s speaking with his younger brother, who is still in Jordan but trying to leave for America. Only with his brother does Ayad open up and begin to communicate in Arabic. Every day, his family washes Ayad, dresses him, and asks him to do simple household tasks to move around \u2014 otherwise he\u2019d simply sit in a corner. His actions are limited, and whenever he\u2019s exposed to change he seems to regress.\n\n\u201cHe can\u2019t differentiate between right or wrong,\u201d Shahrazad said. \u201cYou have to follow him everywhere, even across the road.\u201d Her eyes filled with tears.\n\n\u201cWe pray to God to find a way to help him,\u201d Khalid added.\n\nThe Al Alawis are among the thousands of refugees who resettle in the U.S. every year in an effort to escape the wars and humanitarian crises in their home region. For some, resettling is also an opportunity to find proper medical care. Not all refugees have a diagnosis like Ayad, but a large amount of them have special medical and mental health needs.\n\nRefugees are eligible for Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, but they still face plenty of obstacles to receiving proper care. In cities across the U.S., refugee agencies work locally to remove some of these barriers to health care. Former refugees help newly-arrived ones to get their feet on the ground, but they also hope to go beyond the basics, offering specialized mental health services and programs for survivors of torture to heal the wounds of war.\n\nMore than one million people reached Europe's shores last year -- the majority of them refugees fleeing conflict in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan -- in the continent's worst migration crisis since World War II. ANGELOS TZORTZINIS/AFP/Getty Images\n\nHow To Ride the Bus\n\nThere are some 19.5 million United Nations-registered refugees displaced due to conflict or persecution throughout the world, according to June 2015 data from the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Only 1 percent end up getting relocated to a developed third country; the rest remain in their crisis-ridden countries (like Syria or Iraq) or in refugee camps in host countries like Jordan. This is mainly due to the rigorous, lengthy, screening and interviewing process they have to go through.\n\n\u201cThere are background checks\u2026 and the vetting process continues from the first step until their arrival in the U.S.,\u201d Will Haney, a spokesperson for Church World Service in New York City, told Medical Daily . \u201cRefugees are the most vetted population entering the U.S. If [officials aren\u2019t 100 percent] certain, those refugees are not going to be coming to the U.S.\u201d\n\nFor the past several years, America has been accepting 70,000 refugees annually, most of whom are from Africa, Asia, and the Middle East, though many are also from the former Soviet Union (such as Ukraine and Russia). In 2015, Ohio accepted 316 refugees from Iraq and Afghanistan, 78 from Syria, and hundreds of others from other countries \u2014 including Bhutan, the former Soviet Union, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Somalia. After the U.S. accepts a refugee, the federal government works with nine refugee agencies who then relay the refugee\u2019s information to other, smaller resettlement agencies scattered throughout the country.\n\n\u201cAll of the little things that we take for granted, the resettlement agency helps [the refugees] with,\u201d Bill Swersey, communications director at New York City-based HIAS (formerly the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society), told Medical Daily. \u201cThe goal is to get them up on their own two feet in a relatively short period of time.\u201d\n\nHealth care is key. In the U.S., it can be difficult for the average person to keep up with a quickly changing and evolving health care system. Refugees, many of whom have never experienced a Western health care system, often face language barriers and usually do not have their own transportation.\n\nIn Ohio, Us Together is one of the smaller refugee agencies that provides services for newly arrived refugees. Founded and run by former refugees, the agency helps remove hurdles to health care by educating refugees about pharmaceuticals, providing families with a mentor, and offering transportation services to the doctor\u2019s office.\n\nOne example of Us Together\u2019s work is a newly established pharmacy program in Columbus. Once or twice a month, refugees gather for a two-hour class where they learn about how to get and fill prescriptions at pharmacies. Workers also sit down with refugees to teach them about the transportation system in their city, showing them how to ride the bus to the hospital or doctor\u2019s office.\n\nThe goal for all refugees, explained Us Together director and co-founder Nadia Kasvin, is to ultimately have a job within four to six months of their arrival to the U.S. \u201cWe need to address any mental and medical issues they might have, and remove those barriers to finding a job,\u201d Kasvin told Medical Daily.\n\nFor the Al Alawi family, that means finding help for Ayad \u2014 so that both parents and Ayad\u2019s sister will be able to work without having to care for him 24/7. Finding work is a matter of survival for resettled refugees; it defines the difference between a new life and a spiral into another crisis.\n\nKhalid Al Alawi worked as an engineering professor in Libya and Jordan, and he would like to somehow return to teaching here in the U.S. Lecia Bushak\n\nKhalid, who has a Masters degree in engineering and was a professor in Libya and Jordan for several years, will have to completely re-start here in the U.S. \u201cI would love to take a part-time job in teaching,\u201d Khalid said. \u201cWhen I found this teaching job in Libya, I found it very touching. The years flew by. Teaching is important to me, it\u2019s a lovable job.\u201d But without U.S. credentials, Khalid will be more likely to have to take a more menial job, like working at a restaurant or store.\n\nAnd before Ayad can be sent to an autism specialist or community groups, the Al Alawi family must first go through the government-mandated health screenings that are necessary upon the first month of arrival.\n\nAn anti-racism protester sits behind a banner with the lettering 'Refugees Welcome' during a rally on August 29, 2015. ROBERT MICHAEL/AFP/Getty Images\n\nStealing Their Blood\n\nOn a Monday morning at Neighborhood Family Practice (NFP) in Cleveland, the waiting room was filled with the chatter of foreign languages \u2014 Swahili, Spanish, Arabic, Nepali. Nearly everyone is a newly-arrived refugee, escaping either a recent conflict or 20 stalled years in a refugee camp, and waiting to undergo their first health screening in America.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like the UN in here on Mondays,\u201d said Jamie Bullus, NFP\u2019s Refugee Services Program Coordinator.\n\nThese refugees have all already undergone initial health screenings abroad; according to the CDC, if a refugee has a Class A condition \u2014 active or infectious tuberculosis (TB), leprosy, untreated syphilis or gonorrhea, or mental health issues that are considered dangerous \u2014 they don\u2019t make it to the next step, and can\u2019t enter the U.S. Class B conditions include inactive or latent TB, treated STDs, or pregnancy: things that have to be cared for before they get to the next step. Refugees with a history of suicide or crime are disqualified, as they may pose a threat upon entering.\n\nThen, on arrival each refugee goes through another standard government-regulated health screening . \u201cThe overseas medical exam is an exam of exclusion,\u201d said Bullus. \u201cEvery exam up to this point is why you can\u2019t go to the U.S. Now that they\u2019re here, if there\u2019s anything wrong with them, they can begin to open up.\u201d Each year, NFP, screens over 600 refugees upon their arrival in the U.S., and 70 percent of these refugees return to NFP for primary care.\n\nIzabayo Nsabiyeze getting his blood pressure measured during his first health screening in the U.S. Nsabiyeze was living in a refugee camp in Uganda for the past 18 years; this is his first experience with Western medicine. Lecia Bushak\n\nIzabayo Nsabiyeze sat in a small room as a medical assistant asked him about his medical and family history. Nsabiyeze is Congolese, but before coming to America he lived in a refugee camp in Uganda for 18 years. He spoke broken English, but felt far more comfortable speaking Swahili, so another former Congolese refugee acted as an interpreter. The medical assistant went through a checklist of standard questions: How many siblings do you have? Have you had any aches or pains? Did you experience torture or trauma while you were living abroad? There are stool and urine samples, vision and weight measurements, a flu vaccine, and blood tests.\n\nThe refugees will return to the medical center a week later for a second part of the screening process, in which they\u2019ll be asked to complete a mental health survey, typically printed out in their native language. Because most refugees come from countries that have no mental health system in place and where the idea of seeking mental health counselling is stigmatized or completely unheard of, the survey words symptoms as something physical: \u201cfeeling faint, dizzy, weak, restless,\u201d or \u201ccrying easily, feeling numb when reminded of the trauma.\u201d\n\nLeila runs a vision test during the refugee health screening to determine if any refugees need to be referred to an eye specialist. Lecia Bushak\n\nLeila explaining why they needed to take blood samples from Nsabiyeze, with help from interpreter Felix. Felix Duunganwe, a former Congolese refugee, speaks five different languages. Each refugee is paired up with an interpreter during doctor appointments. Lecia Bushak\n\nAfter getting vials of his blood drawn, Nsabiyeze returned to the room looking a little bewildered. He asked the medical assistant why so much blood was taken from him: \u201cWhat are they going to do with all of my blood?\u201d\n\nAs confusion over medical practice is common, it\u2019s NFP\u2019s job to help the refugees understand the Western viewpoint on medicine a little better. \u201cA lot of times it just comes down to explaining what it\u2019s for and taking that extra minute,\u201d Bullus said. \u201cWe have groups who don\u2019t want their blood taken; they think we\u2019re stealing it. \u2026 Some cultures don\u2019t think they should have to take medicine every day, as they think it means they\u2019re very sick. That\u2019s why every visit is a little bit of a health education.\u201d\n\nWhile educating patients, NFP doctors must also be aware of each culture\u2019s health quirks to better treat them. Bullus sent emails to the staff during Ramadan to remind nurses and physicians that their Muslim patients\u2019 blood sugar levels may be off that week. And NFP doctors deal with chronic conditions rarely seen in the U.S., like malaria, intestinal parasites, lead poisoning, and anemia, which are incredibly common among refugee populations.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to practice global health in Cleveland,\u201d Bullus said. \u201cYou don\u2019t expect to see malaria in Cleveland, but our providers do.\u201d\n\nPratik cries out as he receives several vaccines and a flu shot. The initial health screening is to make sure all the refugees are caught up on their vaccinations. Lecia Bushak\n\n\u201cThey Create Their Own Crisis\u201d\n\nThe average American hasn\u2019t survived war crimes or torture, or lived in a refugee camp for 25 years. But even among Americans, getting access to mental health care isn\u2019t always easy due to stigma , cost, or a shortage of mental health care practitioners. So when it comes to refugees, most of whom have survived trauma in one way or another, helping them get access to health care is a priority for refugee agencies.\n\nResearch has shown that Syrian refugees living in camps are more likely to have depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and other mental health problems than those who aren\u2019t affected by the crisis. Even for the lucky ones who make it to the U.S. or another third country, it will often take years to adjust to a normal life and deal with conflict-related mental illness. That\u2019s because after months, years, and even decades of living in chaos and fear, refugees are often stuck in \u201chigh-anxiety crisis mode,\u201d explained Danielle Drake, community relations manager at the Cleveland Us Together office.\n\n\u201cIf [the refugees] have nothing to do and nowhere to go, they almost create their own crisis because they don\u2019t know how to not be in crisis mode,\u201d Drake told Medical Daily. \u201cI\u2019ll have people call me and think their house is flooding, and I get there and their sink is leaking.\u201d It takes time and resources to ease refugees into the normal hum of life in America. The most important thing, Drake said, is to make sure refugee families have a schedule. With mental health counselling, working a job, or going to school, refugees will slowly begin to recover from crisis mode. \u201cThey can adjust, and say, \u2018Okay, this is my new life, I can go to work and come home and eat dinner, spend time with my family, and everything is okay,\u201d Drake said. \u201cThere doesn\u2019t need to be something bad that happens to me every single morning.\u201d\n\nBullus says that many refugees will fill out mental health surveys when they arrive in the U.S. and say they feel no distress at all. Six months later, however, they\u2019ll begin to exhibit signs of depression or even suicidal tendencies.\n\nA refugee\u2019s mental health \u201cis that Pandora\u2019s box that people are scared to open,\u201d Bullus said. \u201cThe amount of families who come over with children kidnapped or husbands missing, that\u2019s something you find out once they get here. They\u2019re so ashamed of what happened to them, it\u2019s going to take a while for them to open up\u2026 all their experiences are still going on, they\u2019re still receiving threats, their families are still [in their home countries]. This is stuff that doesn\u2019t come up with screening. The real health burden is the after-screening.\u201d\n\nOf course, there are often cultural challenges to mental health care. In many cultures around the globe, people who seek out mental health care may end up getting stigmatized in their community. To help refugees overcome that obstacle, local case workers get creative; sometimes, for example, they provide mental health counseling under a different name, like \u201ccommunity integration support groups.\u201d\n\nWhen I asked Bullus about how Ayad could find mental health assistance here, she noted that it would be more difficult for an autistic adult to be treated. \u201cAdult refugees who resettle and claim a disability often have a difficult time having it recognized if they have no documented medical diagnoses and medical records, which many of them don\u2019t,\u201d Bullus explained. \u201cChildren that come over here with developmental disabilities, we immediately get them into an area hospital\u2019s comprehensive care program... They can go to school again, they can go to summer camps\u2026 it\u2019s really opening doors for these families who had nowhere to turn before arriving here.\u201d For adults like Ayad, however, it\u2019s harder because he\u2019s gone his whole life without a diagnosis or treatment. \u201cBut between the resettlement agencies and [NFP], we try to do as much as possible to get them the care they should\u2019ve been receiving their whole life.\u201d\n\nShahrazad Al Alawi (right), and Ibrahim Alani (left), the family's case manager. Alani is himself a former Iraqi refugee who was re-settled in Cleveland. He now helps over 100 different Iraqi families in the Cleveland area. Lecia Bushak\n\nBecause of this, for the Al Alawi family, overcoming \u201ccrisis mode\u201d may be a little more difficult. Not only has Ayad lived with untreated autism his entire life, but he has also survived the trauma of moving to different countries to escape crisis. Although most of the time Ayad is \u201cquiet and peaceful,\u201d Khalid said, \u201cany change is a problem for him.\u201d\n\nNadia Kasvin was a Russian refugee herself, having arrived in the U.S. from the former Soviet Union in the 1990s. Her own experiences of survival are perhaps what motivate her to improve the way refugees are cared for today. One of the ways she\u2019s doing that is by helping to spearhead a newly-formed program for survivors of torture, which helps refugees (as well as non-refugees), recover from the trauma of torture abroad.\n\n\u201cWe see a lot of victims of gender violence and torture, and these things don\u2019t go away by themselves,\u201d Kasvin said. \u201c[These issues] need a lot of effort and services, so we designed this program to provide services for social, medical, and mental health needs as well as spiritual and wellness services.\u201d The program, which will be rolled out in Columbus, Cleveland and Toledo, aims to develop a network of partners to help build community for more sustainable services, and ultimately involve mainstream medical providers (such as Mount Carmel Hospital in Columbus) to begin offering special services to refugees suffering from the trauma of surviving torture.\n\n\u201cMy mom and my grandmother are Holocaust survivors, and I wish someone had addressed their [emotional and mental health] issues, but they\u2019re still not addressed,\u201d Kasvin said. \u201cWe see the results of not addressing them. They just don\u2019t go away; it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a year ago, 10 years ago, or 70 years ago. There are still huge needs that if we don\u2019t address in a timely matter, they morph into something else, they persist, and then they come up in some different form decades later.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "refugee healthcare, refugees, autism, mental health care", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Refugees from Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and the former Soviet Union arrive in the U.S. after months, years, or even a lifetime without medical care; here's how they're integrated into the American healthcare system.", "title": "How Refugees Get The Care They Need To Build New Lives In America", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/refugee-healthcare-371676", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/02/02/syrian-refugee-crisis.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Refugees from Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and the former Soviet Union arrive in the U.S. after months, years, or even a lifetime without medical care; here's how they're integrated into the American healthcare system.", "title": "How Refugees Get The Care They Need To Build New Lives In America", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/refugee-healthcare-371676", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/02/02/syrian-refugee-crisis.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/02/02/syrian-refugee-crisis.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2016-02-02T11:00:00-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T11:47:59-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Refugees from Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and the former Soviet Union arrive in the U.S. after months, years, or even a lifetime without medical care; here's how they're integrated into the American healthcare system."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb7b4\"", "article_summary": "But even among Americans, getting access to mental health care isn\u2019t always easy due to stigma , cost, or a shortage of mental health care practitioners.\nIn many cultures around the globe, people who seek out mental health care may end up getting stigmatized in their community.\nThe real health burden is the after-screening.\u201dOf course, there are often cultural challenges to mental health care.\nIn cities across the U.S., refugee agencies work locally to remove some of these barriers to health care.\nIn the U.S., it can be difficult for the average person to keep up with a quickly changing and evolving health care system."}
