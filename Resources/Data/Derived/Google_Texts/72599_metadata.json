That is the conclusion of a new study from Karolinska University Hospital in Sweden, where researchers have determined that a patient\u2019s own stem cells can make treatment three times more effective. The findings could lead to the eradication of the potentially fatal, resilient TB strains that currently affect about 450,000 patients.\n\nWhile most forms of tuberculosis are kept in check by modern health care, a subset of patients still respond poorly to conventional medication. These types of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) currently represent a tremendous burden on public health, particularly in developing nations. If the disease is to be eliminated once and for all, these cases must come to the fore of research and drug design.\n\nStem Cells and Tuberculosis\n\nThe new study, which is published in the journal The Lancet, sought to investigate whether current therapies can be complemented with mesenchymal stromal cells \u2014 a group of tissue-repairing stem cells known to migrate to the lungs in response to inflammation or injury. As TB typically attacks the pulmonary system, the team theorized that a batch of these stem cells may help drugs fight the infection. According to lead researcher Dr. Markus Maeurer, Phase I testing has so far yielded promising results.\n\n\"Conventional treatment for MDR-TB uses a combination of TB drugs [antibiotics] which are harmful to patients,\u201d he said in a press release. \u201cOur new approach, using the patients' own bone-marrow stromal cells is safe and could help overcome the body's excessive inflammatory response, repair and regenerate inflammation-induced damage to lung tissue, and lead to improved cure rates.\"\n\nFor the trial, the researchers enrolled 30 patients diagnosed with MDR-TB. These patients were given standard antibiotic treatment in combination with about 10 million stromal stem cell extracted from their bone-marrow. After 18 months, their values were compared to those of a control group administered only antibiotics.\n\nAt the end of the trial, Maeurer and his colleagues found that 16 of the patients treated with stem cells had been cured of the disease. In the control group, only 5 were deemed TB-free. If similar results can be obtained in a large-scale Phase II trial, physicians around the world could soon find themselves with a brand new weapon in the fight against MDR-TB, co-author Dr. Alimuddin told reporters.\n\n\"The results of this novel and exciting study show that the current challenges and difficulties of treating MDR-TB are not insurmountable, and they bring a unique opportunity with a fresh solution to treat hundreds of thousands of people who die unnecessarily of drug-resistant TB,\u201d he explained. \u201cFurther evaluation in phase 2 trials is now urgently required to ascertain efficacy and further safety in different geographical regions such as South Africa where MDR-TB and XDR-TB [extensively drug resistant tuberculosis] are rife.\u201d\n\nEliminating Tuberculosis Once and for All\n\nAs TB has been virtually eradicated in US, it is easy to forget that the disease remains a considerable threat in many parts of the world. Although TB deaths and infections fell in 2012 to 1.3 million and 8.6 million respectively, a report released last year by the World Health Organization (WHO) suggests that undiagnosed cases and drug-resistant strains continue to plague national health care systems in Eastern Europe, Asia, and South Africa. According to Mario Raviglione, WHO director of the Global TB program, many of these nations are also ill-equipped to handle these cases.\n\n\u201cThe unmet demand for a full-scale and quality response to multidrug-resistant tuberculosis is a real public health crisis,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt is unacceptable that increased access to diagnosis is not being matched by increased access to MDR-TB care. We have patients diagnosed but not enough drug supplies or trained people to treat them.\u201d\n\nBy illuminating a simple and effective way to supplement conventional drugs, the findings of the current study stand to transform imperiled care programs across the globe. \"The procedures for obtaining stromal cells from the patient's own bone marrow are relatively simple,\u201d Maeuer explained. \u201cIf successful in phase 2 trials, will provide a viable adjunctive therapy for patients with MDR-TB not responding to conventional drug treatment or those with severe lung damage.\"", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "multi-drug resistant tuberculosis treatment, stem cells, more effective, phase i study", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Multi-drug resistant tuberculosis treatment is much more effective when administered in combination with bone-marrow stem cells, Phase I study finds.", "title": "Stem Cells Make Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis Drugs 3 Times More Effective In Trial", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/multi-drug-resistant-tuberculosis-treatment-3-times-more-effective-stem-cells-266658", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/08/tuberculosis.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Multi-drug resistant tuberculosis treatment is much more effective when administered in combination with bone-marrow stem cells, Phase I study finds.", "title": "Stem Cells Make Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis Drugs 3 Times More Effective In Trial", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/multi-drug-resistant-tuberculosis-treatment-3-times-more-effective-stem-cells-266658", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/08/tuberculosis.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/08/tuberculosis.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Conditions", "published_time": "2014-01-08T18:31:49-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-08T18:37:01-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Multi-drug resistant tuberculosis treatment is much more effective when administered in combination with bone-marrow stem cells, Phase I study finds."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd85f5\"", "article_summary": "These types of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) currently represent a tremendous burden on public health, particularly in developing nations.\nThat is the conclusion of a new study from Karolinska University Hospital in Sweden, where researchers have determined that a patient\u2019s own stem cells can make treatment three times more effective.\nStem Cells and TuberculosisThe new study, which is published in the journal The Lancet, sought to investigate whether current therapies can be complemented with mesenchymal stromal cells \u2014 a group of tissue-repairing stem cells known to migrate to the lungs in response to inflammation or injury.\nAs TB typically attacks the pulmonary system, the team theorized that a batch of these stem cells may help drugs fight the infection.\nWhen it comes to treating drug resistant tuberculosis, the body\u2019s own defense may be able to boost conventional drug therapy."}
