According to a newly released report, he predicts:\n\n1. 80 percent of what doctors do, diagnostics, will be replaced by machines\n\n2. Medicine will become tailor-made for each patient\n\n3. Consumer-driven tech will create better incentives to keep people healthy\n\nFor good measure, we think Khosla missed one important aspect of the future: we\u2019ll move from disease care to actual health care. That is, thanks to pervasive monitoring, our goals won\u2019t simply be to not be sick but to become the best person we can be.\n\nA fidelity to science\n\n\u201cIn the past, the data to make more rigorous and scientific conclusions has simply not been available,\u201d reads Khosla\u2019s most recent draft report [PDF].\n\n\u201cAnd as a result, medical literature is rife with studies about how the practice of medicine does not meet expectations for what would constitute sufficient, correct care.\u201d\n\nIn one case, he notes, a major meta-analysis contradicted advice on the use of beta-blockers to prevent those at risk of stroke. \u201cDespite being discredited, the AHA guideline has not been retracted as of 2013,\u201d he concludes. The sheer volume of information is difficult to keep up with, even for the smartest doctors.\n\nSmart diagnostic robots will able to apply the most advanced science to common problems. \u201cThat\u2019s not to say 80 percent of doctors will go away. It\u2019s that systems and consumers (directly) will handle 80 percent of their current work, so the role of the doctor will adapt dramatically to add value.\u201d\n\nIn this case, think about IBM\u2019s Jeopardy champion, Watson, which is already showing signs that it can diagnose cancer better than some doctors.\n\nTailor-made for you\n\nAdvanced manufacturing will combine with big data to make tailor-made recommendations and drug prescriptions.\n\n\u201cData science will start to tell us how to measure the effectiveness of a particular drug for a particular patient\u2019s specific conditions/genomics, environment/ethnicity, as opposed to the status quo of having drug companies develop one drug for all seven billion people on the planet,\u201d Khosla predicts.\n\nDoctors are already using genomic sequencing to target treatment more precisely. And chemists have tested existing 3D printers to replicate drugs. So, instead of all patients taking the same pill, measured out in oddly convenient integers, a home printer will delivery print a drug has precisely the amount of medicine you need.\n\nCheck out this TED talk on the subject:\n\nStill, Khosla may have overlooked the controversial key needed to unlock this precision: public health data. In order to use all available health data collected, we have to combine health datasets. But combining that information has recently been used to re-identify anonymized data.\n\nConsumer tech & better incentives\n\nIt is true that the Affordable Care Act (\u201cObamacare\u201d) attempts to reward doctors for the outcomes of their patients, but that isn\u2019t the case with the entire medical innovation industry.\n\nDiagnostic devices are getting cheaper and cheaper; entrepreneurs may have different incentives to build tools that are both cheaper and more accurate, unlike hospitals.\n\n\u201cMedical device manufacturers, like those that build and sell huge scanning systems, don\u2019t want to cannibalize sales of their expensive equipment by providing cheaper, more accessible monitoring devices, such as a $29 ECG monitor,\u201d reads the report.\n\nOnce expensive electrocardiograms can now fit on the back of an iPhone, Khosla continues, \u201cHealth insurance could give people similar financial rewards for improving their health and further making the consumer the CEO of his own health.\u201d\n\nOptimal health\n\nKhosla\u2019s otherwise fascinating look at the future of health has one important oversight: The overarching theme is still curing diseases, not optimizing health. The current health system assumes that as long as we\u2019re not sick, there\u2019s no reason to see a doctor.\n\nBut consumer devices are showing how improvements in meditation, nutrition, and exercise can make us each better versions of ourselves.\n\nComputer-guided meditation headsets can already help novice yogis learn the amazing benefits of mindfulness. The upcoming Muse headband will be able to read our brain waves throughout the day. This available technology will soon able to show us how our eating and sleeping habits influence our stress and focus all day long.\n\nThe Jawbone Up, once a simple pedometer, now has an app to measure how caffeine intake affects our sleep. Very soon, we\u2019ll be immersed in technology that can show us in real time how to feel as refreshed and energetic as we can possibly be. Once people get a taste, they\u2019ll want even more.\n\nMoreover, ocular wearables like Google Glass will be able to automatically analyze the nutritional content of food from a picture and then correlate that to weight gain measured by Internet-connected scales. We\u2019ll know immediately what foods leave us drifting towards heart failure or vitamin deficiencies or closer to wellness and whole-body health.\n\nHybrid medical/sports startups, such as blood-diagnostics company WellnessFX, are beginning to cater to consumers who treat optimal living as their personal medical strategy. Genetrainer connects to genetics testing startup 23andMe and tells budding athletes how to optimize their regiment for their particular genes.\n\nOptimal health, with any luck, will increasingly be part of the medical industry.\n\nYou can read Khosla\u2019s very thorough forecast in this PDF.", "article_metadata": {"bt": {"pubDate": "2014-05-20T09:55:04+00:00", "author": "gregory-ferenstein", "modDate": "2014-05-20T09:55:04+00:00", "keywords": "top-stories", "type": "news", "id": 1476862}, "og": {"site_name": "VentureBeat", "description": "Legendary co-founder of Sun Microsystems has predicted the future of health.
