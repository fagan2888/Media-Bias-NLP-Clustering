Kelvin Herrera breezed through the eighth.\n\nDavis gave up a leadoff single and walked pinch-hitter Cliff Pennington, but bounced back to strike out leadoff man Ben Revere and MVP candidate Josh Donaldson. Jose Bautista then flied out to right to give Davis his third postseason save and the Royals another postseason comeback win.\n\nThe Royals had been held to one hit by Price before stringing together four singles and a double in their go-ahead inning. They got run-producing hits from Eric Hosmer, Mike Moustakas, Alex Gordon and Alex Rios, along with an RBI groundout from Kendrys Morales.\n\nIt was a monumental collapse for Price, who had at one point recorded 18 straight outs. He fell to 0-7 in seven postseason starts, including a loss to Texas in their AL Division Series.\n\nMeanwhile, the reigning AL champs have won nine straight ALCS games dating to their memorable seven-game series against Toronto in 1985 \u2014 the year they won their only World Series. The record is 10 straight wins set by Baltimore in the 1970s and \u201980s.\n\nNow, the Blue Jays head home for Game 3 on Monday night in dire trouble. All but three of the previous 25 teams to take a 2-0 lead in the best-of-seven era have won the series \u2014 though Toronto did rally from the same hole to beat the Rangers in five games in the divisional round.\n\nFor most of the afternoon, it appeared the Blue Jays would forge a 1-1 tie.\n\nRyan Goins drove in a run off Ventura in the third, snapping an 18-inning scoreless streak by Royals pitchers, and Edwin Encarnacion and Troy Tulowitzki had RBIs in the sixth.\n\nThe way Price was carving up the lineup, a 3-0 lead looked to be enough.\n\nThe only bad pitch he threw the first six innings was his first, which Escobar swatted for a leadoff single. He threw first-pitch strikes to 12 of 14 batters at one point, and struck out the side in the sixth inning, giving no indication he was about to implode.\n\nThe Royals\u2019 rally began after a costly defensive lapse.\n\nZobrist sent a popup to shallow right field to start the seventh, and Goins gave chase from second base and Bautista from right field. Both wound up letting it drop for a single, and for the first time all game, a sellout crowd at Kauffman Stadium began to stir.\n\nCain followed with a clean single to extend his postseason hit streak to 11 games, matching a franchise record. Hosmer\u2019s single got the Royals on the board, and Morales added an RBI groundout up the middle, before Moustakas came up. In a 2-for-25 slump and without an RBI this postseason, he pulled a tying double to right field to set the crowd of 40,357 into a frenzy.\n\nGordon\u2019s double gave Kansas City the lead. Rios added another single off reliever Aaron Sanchez to close the book on Price, who was dinged for all five runs in one disastrous inning.\n\nThe last time he allowed five runs in an inning was May 8. The opponent: Kansas City.\n\nThe Royals tacked on another run off the Toronto relief corps in the eighth, but it was hardly necessary. Kansas City\u2019s own shutdown bullpen made certain the lead would stand up.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Little hit, big win; Royals beat Blue Jays for 2-0 lead in ALCS", "title": "Little hit, big win; Royals beat Blue Jays for 2-0 lead in ALCS", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/10/17/little-hit-big-win-royals-beat-blue-jays-for-2-0-lead-in-alcs/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151017__royalsp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151017__royalsp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-17T18:16:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T08:21:01+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Wade Davis survived a shaky ninth for Kansas City after Luke Hochevar and Danny Duffy were solid in relief of Yordano Ventura.\nKANSAS CITY, Mo.\nJose Bautista then flied out to right to give Davis his third postseason save and the Royals another postseason comeback win.\nThe opponent: Kansas City.\nGordon\u2019s double gave Kansas City the lead."}
