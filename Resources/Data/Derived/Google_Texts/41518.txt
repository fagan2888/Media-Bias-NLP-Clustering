Yesterday I noted on Twitter that “The really funny part is that #Julia was a web designer.” Some people thought I was kidding. But I wasn’t. Even better, the “Life of Julia” slideshow informed us that “For the past four years, Julia has worked full-time as a web designer. Thanks to Obamacare, her health insurance is required to cover birth control and preventative care, letting Julia focus on her work rather than worry about her health.“

Now, in the real world, thanks to Obamacare, her hours have been pared back to 29 hours and she’s been dumped onto the exchanges where, as a young, healthy single woman, her premiums will go through the roof even as she earns less money. That is, if she can even get onto a website created by and for people just like her.
