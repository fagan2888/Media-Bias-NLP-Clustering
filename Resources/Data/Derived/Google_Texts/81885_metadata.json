Currently, Rothenberg said, the hospital has 23 full-time nurses on staff.\n\nHe says the Agency of Human Services has been aware that nursing salaries in state government make recruitment challenging, and a work group is expected to come up with recommendations soon.\n\n\"We were hoping we would be able to continue to use the same amount of traveling nurses until that work group was done with their work, but we were not able to reach that,\" he said, \"so we're taking these interim steps of sign-on bonuses and retention bonuses in the meantime and hope for that to make a substantial difference.\"", "article_metadata": {"category": "VPR News", "description": "The new Vermont Psychiatric Care Hospital opened in Berlin just over a year ago, but a nursing shortage already has one of the hospital's four units shut", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "The Frequency, VPR News", "og": {"url": "http://digital.vpr.net/post/state-seeks-address-nursing-shortage-signing-retention-bonuses", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/vpr/files/styles/medium/public/201506/vt-psychiatric-hospital-vpr-lindholm-20150630.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The new Vermont Psychiatric Care Hospital opened in Berlin just over a year ago, but a nursing shortage already has one of the hospital's four units shut", "title": "State Seeks To Address Nursing Shortage With Signing, Retention Bonuses"}, "story_id": 434386207, "twitter": {"site": "@vprnet", "card": "summary", "creator": "@taylordobbs"}, "author": "Taylor Dobbs", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "State Seeks To Address Nursing Shortage With Signing, Retention Bonuses"}, "nid": 34969, "datePublished": "2015-08-24", "keywords": "Mental Health, Health, VPR News, Vermont Psychiatric Care Hospital, The Frequency", "wordCount": 380, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Rothenberg says the state is in the process of coming up with signing and retention bonuses to help attract nurses to 16 unfilled nursing positions at the hospital.\nThen summer came, \"and the number of traveling nurses that were referred to us by the two companies that we were using dropped dramatically,\" he said.\nThe hospital reached full capacity in February, with all 25 beds full, but it wasn't because the state had hired enough nurses to staff it.\n\"When we reached full capacity in February and when we were at full capacity, we were using a substantial amount of traveling nurses,\" said hospital CEO Jeff Rothenberg.\nThe new Vermont Psychiatric Care Hospital opened in Berlin just over a year ago, but a nursing shortage already has one of the hospital's four units shut down."}
