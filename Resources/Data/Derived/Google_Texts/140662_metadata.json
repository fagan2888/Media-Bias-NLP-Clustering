Scott Walker (R) said Sunday that he supports a constitutional amendment that would bar the Supreme Court from granting marriage equality rights nationwide.\n\nThe Supreme Court is expected to issue a decision this month that could grant, for once and for all, same-sex couples the right to wed across the country. But Walker said on ABC's \"This Week\" that he would support amending the constitution to protect states that still want to ban same-sex marriage.\n\n\"I personally believe that marriage is between one man and one woman,\" Walker, a prospective GOP presidential candidate, said. \"If the court decides that, the only next approach is for those who are supporters of marriage being defined as between one man and one woman is ultimately to consider pursuing a constitutional amendment.\"\n\nHe added that \"the decision on defining marriage should be left up to the states.\"\n\nSame-sex marriage is legal in Wisconsin. Walker has said that he voted for the state's constitutional ban on marriage equality in 2006, which was overturned eight years later by the courts.\n\nIn April, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who is also running for president, introduced legislation to establish a constitutional amendment protecting states that want to bar same-sex marriage.\n\nDemocratic National Committee Press Secretary Holly Shulman criticized Walker's comments Sunday, saying, \"Walker showed us today the same divisive policies that he has supported throughout his career when it comes to the rights of LGBT Americans. We don\u2019t expect more, but the American people should know what a Walker presidency would mean for the rights of their family and friends.\"\n\nWalker refused to give an opinion on the transition of Caitlyn Jenner and her Vanity Fair cover when asked about the topic Sunday morning.\n\nPresident Barack Obama tweeted last week that Jenner has shown \"courage.\"\n\nIt takes courage to share your story. https://t.co/Q7wWjV9Rxx \u2014 Barack Obama (@BarackObama) June 1, 2015\n\n\"Well, I think it\u2019s a personal decision,\" Walker said. \"And to me, I don\u2019t know that there\u2019s anything more to comment on. It\u2019s a personal decision.\"\n\nThis article has been updated to include comment from the DNC.\n\nWant more updates from Amanda?
