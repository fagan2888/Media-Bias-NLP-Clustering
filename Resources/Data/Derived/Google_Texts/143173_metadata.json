But they're definitely not the stuff of healthy, organic eating, since good ol\u2019 Kraft is notorious for pumping its products with a lot of sodium, dyes, fat, and preservatives.\n\nIt may be rather confusing to find out then, that these very Kraft Singles seem to have been given a seal of approval from the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, an organization that represents some 75,000 registered dietitians and nutritionists. The organization has placed the new \u201cKids Eat Right\u201d label onto the cheese products, which will now be featured on its packaging in your local grocery store, reminding parents that Kraft cheese is\u2026 good for you?\n\nThe Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics has released a statement hoping to clarify, noting that \"Kraft is putting the 'Kids Eat Right' logo [on its packaging and] saying Kraft is a proud supporter of Kids Eat Right, not vice versa. The Academy has never once endorsed any product, brand or service, and we never will.\u201d But it's likely this is going to confuse everyone, anyway.\n\nAlso, nutritionists at the Academy claim that these particular Kraft singles contain a lot of calcium, as well as vitamin D, and that should be reason enough for kids to eat them. Kari Ryan, director of nutrition, science and regulatory affairs at Kraft, as well as a member of the Academy, told The New York Times that 80 percent of girls and 75 percent of boys between the ages of 4 and 18 don\u2019t get enough calcium.\n\n\u201cWe saw the synergies in taking our mission and the mission of the Academy, and making them into one to drive education and awareness around the nutrient needs of children and how to address them,\u201d Ryan told The Times.\n\nIn addition, under pressure from health advocates, Kraft has been trying to clean up its act. Last year, the company claimed it would be removing artificial preservatives from its full-fat American and White American Kraft Singles. And in 2013, Kraft agreed to remove artificial dyes from its Macaroni and Cheese products in the U.S. and Canada.\n\nWhile this is all a good step for a company that is lagging behind in the healthy ingredients department, the question remains: why would the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics choose Kraft Singles, out of all possible products out there, as its very first \u201cKids Eat Right\u201d product?\n\n\u201cThe 'Kids Eat Right' logo on Kraft Singles packaging identifies the brand as a proud supporter of Kids Eat Right,\u201d said Mary Beth Whalen, executive director of the Academy, according to the Times. \u201cIt also serves to drive broader visibility to KidsEatRight.org, a trusted educational resource for consumers.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s hard to say how parents will interpret the logo. Will they see it as a stamp that proves Kraft Singles are a trusted healthy food source for the kids?\n\n\u201cI am really shocked that this would be the first thing that the Academy would choose to endorse,\u201d Casey Hinds, a mother and advocate for improving the healthiness of children\u2019s food, told The Times. \u201cIt\u2019s confusing and just one more way that feels like as parents, there are so many forces working against us as we\u2019re trying to raise healthy kids.\u201d\n\nAccording to Fooducate, one slice of the cheese product contains 70 calories, 45 of which are from fat. One slice also contains about 15 percent of the maximum daily consumption of saturated fat, and 11 percent of maximum daily consumption of sodium. So take the \u201cKids Eat Right\u201d label with a grain of salt. While Kraft Singles may be good every so often \u2014 in moderation \u2014 to provide kids with more calcium and vitamin D, it may be better to stick to other sources for those necessary nutrients, like broccoli and milk.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "cheese product, kraft singles, kids eat right", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "They\u2019re bright yellow, individually-wrapped, and horribly processed.
