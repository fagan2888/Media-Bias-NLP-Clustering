Eagles win three titles with a pair of 1-2 finishes

THORNTON — While his teammates appear to like to beat each other, Jack Thorne hasn't been selective with his 100-yard backstroke.

The Thompson Valley senior just beats anybody and everybody. Nobody has really been close, and they definitely weren't on Saturday at the 4A State Swimming and Diving Championships at Veterans Memorial Aquatic Center.

He just couldn't allow it, not after laying claim to the 4A title in the event the past two seasons.

"I just wanted to see what I could do," Thorne said, who was also second in the 200 individual medley. "I just wanted to see what would happen. I'm happy with that. I definitely still get nervous. I was tense and nervous yesterday, and I'm not sure why. Today I was much more relaxed. I figured it was my last one, I might as well go out and have fun and see what happened."

His All-American and 4A record time of 48.30 was faster than he's ever gone in the event at altitude, but that didn't mean his third title was better than the rest. In fact, it was quite the opposite for him.

"I'm still surprised I won it as a sophomore," said Thorne, who joins Sam Hewson as the only swimmers in city history to win three consecutive state titles in an event. Hewson also did it in the backstroke, the first two coming at Loveland, the last at Thompson Valley.

Consider Thorne as close to a no-doubter as there was in the finals. By the first time he came up for air from the start, the rest of the group was racing for second. Daric Sundeen of Golden earned that spot, but he was 5.25 seconds behind Thorne.

That's why his favorite title in the event was the first one. It was close, and it set the rest of his prep career in motion. As a sophomore, he wasn't the hunted, he was the hunter. Coming out of the prelims seeded second, his 49.78 clipped Devon Davis of Air Academy by .29.

"That's one of my favorite memories of high school swimming, winning that race, because it was so close," said Thorne, who will swim for Northwestern next year. "It was a fun race.

"I didn't expect to win it. There were a ton of firsts with that. It was the first time I won it, my first juniors cut. This one was nice, but in terms of how memorable they were, I think the first one was definitely the most memorable one."

Thompson Valley, which finished third as a team with 199 points, won three titles in all, but the other came at the expense of other Eagles. First it was diving, then the 500 freestyle.

Consider the daily routine at the Dick Hewson Aquatic Center diving well. Four guys from Thompson Valley step to the board, work their craft and look to coach Amon McCrary for guidance.

Over and over again.

They did it again Saturday, but without the calm. While McCrary (named the diving coach of the year) was a mess, his troops stayed calm.

In the end, there was a ton of success as the Eagles' diving machine rolled along. Senior Seth Niko made major gains, starting the final three rounds in eighth, but a score of 56 in round two vaulted him up to third.

Collin Williams, another senior who has been the Eagles' best 11-dive performer this year who was named the 4A diver of the year, started the final round in fourth. His first dive moved him up one spot, his second dive another and put him in position to overtake the lead. Only one guy stood in the way

Teammate Kyle Pape.

In the end, the senior didn't budge. His lead may have dwindled in the finals, but his final score of 431.60 stood the test, giving the program its fourth boys diving champion, leaving him with a mess of emotions to sort through. Williams finished at 427.30.

"I knew it was going to be down to between me and Collin," Pape said. "I just had to step it up and do my best. We were still cheering each other on, we were still encouraging each other, we wanted each other to win. We both were fighting against each other, and I thought that was really cool. I wanted Collin to win, but I wanted to win too. It's difficult.

"It's bittersweet. Last meet, but it was awesome."

Pape was better than he has been all year, and picked the perfect day to do it. Not all of his dives were perfect, but McCrary said the key was Pape was able to keep it together in his head, and the diver couldn't have agreed more with the assessment, especially on his final dive.

"I can't even explain it. I had to get my head in the game," Pape said. "It was really just a decision. Something in me ... I wanted it.

"I kind of messed up the dive before, so I was like, 'I've got to step this one up even more. I have to do it even better, finish it off strong.'"

A few events later, Liam Gately entered the longest event of the day as the top seed, his sophomore teammate Chris Eddy second, and that's where the two placed at the end of the race. Gately posted an All-American time of 4:34.22, Eddy's time of 4:36.33 good for All-American consideration.

The same duo finished 3-4 in the 200 freestyle. Gately said swimming against Eddy is just what he does, and without him, he doesn't think his success would be possible.

"I couldn't have done it without Chris, either," he said. "Not only during competition, but always in practice, we're always pushing each other to make each other better, stronger swimmers. If there was a teammate I could swim next to, especially my 500, I'd want it to be Chris."

Seeing another Eagle sophomore win a state title, Thorne's only advice for his teammate is to enjoy the moment and the ones to follow, because they go by quick. Gately is already looking forward to the challenge that awaits him, but mostly he said he'll start with beating himself and then moving forward.

"It was great, and it was my goal since last season. It feels great, amazing," Gately said of the title. "I'm excited, because as Jack came back and did great, I hope to be able to follow and do great in all my feats. There's always new goals I can set for myself. There's a ton of records, even my own times, trying to get better for myself. It's not only a battle with everyone else, but especially myself."

Thompson Valley's divers accounted for 57 points of the team total as Brandon Bicknell placed 12th, giving the team the maximum amount of placers allowed in a single event. The 400 free relay capped the day with a third-place showing of 3:11.48 to set a school record that had stood since 2001. Jack Kisch placed 12th in the 50 free to complete the team scoring.

Mountain View, which finished in 14th with 50 team points, also capped the day with a school record in the 400 free relay, taking 10th at 3:23.67. Senior Nick Rubba led that team off, one that finished up with younger brother Michael. Prior to that, he knocked time off in both of his prelim swims, finishing 10th in the 50 free and 11th in the 100 free. For him, there was no better way to say good-bye to the program.

"It was the last meet, but it was fun getting that record with my brother, seeing Zack (Nickel) get that time and Aiden (Pickering) coming back after his backstroke. It was a lot of fun remembering those guys finishing it off," he said.

"It was amazing. It was just all really cool. It was a fun four years of swimming, and coming out with best times and look back and say I did what I needed to do my last year, it's done. It's good."

Friday, the Lions were flying after getting all three relays qualified for the finals, but after taking 12th in the 200 medley, the 200 free squad was disqualified. But that didn't put a damper on the day, as individually they shaved time and had strong showings.

Pickering won the consolation heat of the 100 back and Logan Jacobs took 13th in the 500 freestyle.
