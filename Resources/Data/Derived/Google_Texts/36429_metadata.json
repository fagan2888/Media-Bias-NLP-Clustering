Charles Grassley (R): Voted NO\n\n\"Omnibus appropriations bills are never the best way forward. Republicans made a commitment to individual spending bills. The Appropriations Committee worked through the grueling task of putting together individual bills, only to be thwarted by the Democrats with nearly every attempt to bring them to debate on the Senate floor. So, now we're left with a bloated year-end deal that increases spending by tens of billions of dollars above the bipartisan promise Congress made in 2011 to rein in runaway spending.\"\n\nSen. Joni Ernst (R): Voted NO\n\n\"While there are some positive aspects of the deal, I could not in good faith support it in its entirety because it not only fails to address the drivers of our fiscal mess, but it exacerbates the problem by leaving taxpayers on the hook. Simply put, I was sent to Washington to cut the pork and this deal adds too much money to an already growing government and unsustainable national debt.\n\nRep. Rod Blum (R): Voted NO\n\n\"I also voted no because the process that gave us today's spending bill is completely broken. Negotiated behind closed doors by Congressional leadership without participation from rank and file members, the bill is over 2,000 pages long and was introduced at 1:30 AM on Wednesday, giving members of Congress less than 60 hours to analyze it and make a \"take it or leave it\" judgment call while under tremendous pressure to pass the bill before the holidays. This process cuts Iowans out of the business of governing, and I'm hopeful that Speaker Ryan will work hard to improve this process when we start the new legislative year in January.\"\n\nRep. Dave Loebsack (D): Voted YES\n\n\"By passing this bill, Congress has ended the constant threat of a Republican government shutdown that the nation has been facing. But this vote was more than just a vote to keep the government open, it was a vote to be a responsible actor and put the needs of Iowans ahead of the special interests that are running Washington. This legislation is not perfect, and it is not the bill that I would have preferred. In the end, it proves there is a governing majority of Republicans and Democrats who are can work together and choose to get things done.\"\n\nRep. David Young (D): Voted NO\n\n\"I spent all year fighting for Iowa values and priorities from my seat on the Committee on Appropriations, where we passed 12 bills that held the line on wasteful spending. At the end of the day, this was neither the process nor the result I or Iowans wanted. Ultimately, I could not support this measure.\"\n\nRep. Steve King (D): Voted NO\n\n\"I introduced 9 amendments to the omnibus spending bill, all of which would have passed if brought to the floor, yet none were made in order. I put these up as a record of what Congress should be doing to restore Article I Constitutional Authority. The American people have been demanding that we defund ObamaCare, executive amnesty, the Supreme Court's ruling on same-sex marriage, Planned Parenthood, WOTUS, the Iran nuclear deal, the refugee resettlement process, climate change, and strike out any expansion of H-2B visas. Going into next year we need to put the priorities of the American people, the promises we made to our constituents and the Constitution at the forefront of the House's legislative agenda.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "Congress passed an $1.14 trillion spending bill to fund the government through next September and avoid a potential government shutdown.", "language": "english", "author": "Adam Carros, KCRG-TV9", "og": {"url": "http://www.kcrg.com/content/news/Spending-Bill-Whats-in-it-and-How-Iowans-Votes-362965471.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/1280x960_51218C00-MEJUR.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Congress passed an $1.14 trillion spending bill to fund the government through next September and avoid a potential government shutdown.", "title": "Spending Bill: What's in it and How Iowans Votes"}, "twitter": {"description": "Congress passed an $1.14 trillion spending bill to fund the government through next September and avoid a potential government shutdown.", "creator": "@KCRG", "url": "http://www.kcrg.com/content/news/Spending-Bill-Whats-in-it-and-How-Iowans-Votes-362965471.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/1280x960_51218C00-MEJUR.jpg", "title": "Spending Bill: What's in it and How Iowans Votes", "site": "@KCRG", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "fb": {"app_id": 1482644542038403, "pages": 57827502171}, "keywords": "Spending Bill: What's in it and How Iowans Votes", "google-site-verification": "_pi-uBEP3DU48yOrVs_IYPqZzPgLtRkS7bl24Ebx1MY", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Spending Bill Whats in it"}, "article_summary": "Congress passed an $1.14 trillion spending bill to fund the government through next September and avoid a potential government shutdown.\nRep.
