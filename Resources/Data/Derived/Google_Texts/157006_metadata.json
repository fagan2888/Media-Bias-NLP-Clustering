As I wrote in a Think Tank post last month, the complex provisions, and the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s limited resources for customer assistance, are likely to result in headaches for millions of Americans.\n\nTo cushion the blow, the Treasury Department has administratively created exemptions to the individual mandate beyond the numerous exemptions written into the Affordable Care Act itself. The Times reported \u201cmore than 30 types of exemptions from the penalty for not having insurance.\u201d The administration released data suggesting that, while as many as 6 million people will face the mandate penalty, up to five times as many\u201415 million to 30 million Americans\u2014will receive exemptions from it.\n\nCreating numerous exemptions for political reasons could cause policy headaches down the road. One could occur if insurers believe the mandate has become ineffective at drawing in healthy individuals and, fearing an influx of costly, sicker patients, decide to exit the exchanges en masse. It\u2019s also possible that a future administration\u2014relying on the Obama administration\u2019s unilateral actions on health care and immigration\u2014could create additional exemptions or other forms of leniency for mandate violators, thereby hastening the insurer exodus.\n\nIn the 2008 Democratic primaries, then-Sen. Obama famously opposed the individual mandate, citing its application in Massachusetts: \u201cThere are people who are paying fines and still can\u2019t afford [health insurance], so now they\u2019re worse off than they were. They don\u2019t have health insurance and they\u2019re paying a fine.\u201d But after having embraced the mandate in 2009 to ease Obamacare\u2019s passage, the administration is now trying to avoid the political dilemma Mr. Obama described seven years ago. Whether and how it does so will have far-reaching policy implications for voters, future administrations, and the future of the law.\n\nChris Jacobs is policy director of America Next, a conservative think tank.
