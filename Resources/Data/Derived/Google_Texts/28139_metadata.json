(AP Photo/Chris Carlson)\n\n(CNSNews.com) \u2013 Donald Trump said during Wednesday night\u2019s Republican presidential debate that as president he would talk to and \u201cget along with\u201d Russian President Vladimir Putin, but rival Carly Fiorina she \u201cwouldn\u2019t talk to him at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cHaving met Vladimir Putin, I wouldn\u2019t talk to him at all,\u201d the former Hewlett-Packard CEO said. \u201cWe talked way too much to him.\u201d\n\nInstead, Fiorina said she would send the Russian leader a clear message, by rebuilding the Sixth Fleet \u2013 whose area of responsibility covers Europe, the Atlantic, and most of Africa \u2013 pursuing missile defense in Poland and conducting \u201cregular, aggressive military exercises in the Baltic states.\u201d\n\n\u201cRussia is a bad actor, but Vladimir Putin is someone we should not talk to, because the only way he will stop is to sense strength and resolve on the other side, and we have all of that within our control,\u201d she said.\n\nHow \u2013 and even whether \u2013 the next U.S. president should deal with foreign adversaries featured during the CNN debate, relating not just to Putin but also to Chinese President Xi Jinping, and the Iranian regime.\n\nAsked about Russia\u2019s deepening military involvement in Syria, Trump characterized the problem as one of a lack of respect for U.S. leadership, saying that Putin has \u201czero\u201d respect for President Obama.\n\nThe entrepreneur and GOP campaign frontrunner said he would talk to Putin and \u201cwould get along with him. I believe \u2013 and I may be wrong, in which case I\u2019d probably have to take a different path. But I would get along with a lot of the world leaders that this country is not getting along with.\u201d\n\nSen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) disagreed with Fiorina\u2019s pledge not to talk to Putin.\n\n\u201cThink if Reagan had said that during the Cold War? We continued to talk with the Russians throughout the Cold War which is much more significant that where we are now,\u201d he said.\n\nBut one person on the stage at the Ronald Reagan President Library who Paul made clear he did not want to see talking to Putin or other world leaders was Trump.\n\n\u201cDo we want someone with that kind of character, that kind of careless language to be negotiating with Putin?\u201d Paul asked, after Trump took a sideways swipe at him. \u201cDo we want someone like that to be negotiating with Iran?\u201d\n\n\u2018We need to be strong against China\u2019\n\nWisconsin Gov. Scott Walker\u2019s repeated an earlier call for President Obama to cancel a planned Sept. 25 state dinner for Xi because of Beijing\u2019s currency manipulation and cyber-attacks.\n\n\u201cWhy would we be giving an official state visit to a country that\u2019s been involved in a massive cyber-attack against the United States?\u201d he asked. \u201cThat\u2019s not just a visit, that\u2019s a 21 gun salute on the South Lawn of the White House. It just doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d\n\nBoth Paul and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush sounded unconvinced.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we need to be rash, I don\u2019t think we need to be reckless, and I think need to leave lines of communication open,\u201d Paul said, referring to relations with both the Chinese and Russians.\n\n\u201cWe do need to be engaged with Russia. It doesn\u2019t mean we give them a free pass, or China a free pass, but, to be engaged, to continue to talk. We did throughout the Cold War, and it would be a big mistake not to do it here.\u201d\n\nAsked whether canceling the state dinner would be the right approach, Bush replied, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so, but we need to be strong against China.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s many other tools that we have without canceling a dinner,\u201d he added, citing sanctions and a deterrent of \u201coffensive tactics\u201d relating to cybersecurity.\n\nRepublican presidential candidate, businessman Donald Trump, center, speaks as Ben Carson, left, and Jeb Bush, look on.

Terrill)\n\nTear up the Iran deal?\n\nHow America\u2019s next president should deal with Iran and the nuclear deal which Obama has reached with the regime was another area of difference among some of the candidates.\n\nAfter outlining his reasons for opposing the Iran agreement, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) reiterated that \u201cIf I am elected president, on the very first day in office, I will rip to shreds this catastrophic Iranian nuclear deal.\u201d\n\nOhio Gov. John Kasich, who has said that anyone threatening to tear up the agreement was playing to the crowd, stressed that he too thought it was a bad deal.\n\nBut Kasich said it would be better to work together with America\u2019s allies, and that if Iran cheats, \u201cwe slap the sanctions back on.\u201d\n\nBush, too, disagreed with Cruz\u2019 threat.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a strategy to tear up an agreement,\u201d he said. \u201cA strategy would be: how do we confront Iran? And, the first thing that we need to do is to establish our commitment to Israel which has been altered by this administration. And, make sure that they have the most sophisticated weapons to send a signal to Iran that we have Israel\u2019s back.\u201d\n\nPaul also opposed his fellow senator\u2019s approach to the Iran deal.\n\n\u201cShould we continue to talk with Iran? Yes. Should we cut up the agreement immediately? That\u2019s absurd. Wouldn\u2019t you want to know if they complied?\u201d\n\nRepublican presidential candidate, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., speaks during the CNN Republican presidential debate. (AP Photo/Mark J. Terrill)\n\nSen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) pushed back on calls to wait and see if the Iranians honor their commitments under the deal, saying that \u201canyone who is paying attention to what [supreme leader Ayatollah Ali] Khamenei says knows that they will not comply.\u201d\n\nTwo other candidates who argued for trashing the Iran deal on their first day in office were former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and Walker.\n\n\u201cWe must, simply, make it very clear that the next president \u2013 one of us on this stage \u2013 will absolutely not honor that agreement, and will destroy it and will be tough with Iran, because otherwise, we put every person in this world in a very dangerous place,\u201d said Huckabee.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d love to play cards with this guy,\u201d said Walker of the president, \u201cbecause Barack Obama folds on everything with Iran.\u201d\n\nFiorina said on her first day as president she would both assure Israel of America\u2019s strong support and present Iran with an ultimatum.\n\n\u201cOn day one in the Oval Office, I will make two phone calls, the first to my good friend to [Israeli Prime Minister] Bibi Netanyahu to reassure him we will stand with the state of Israel.\n\n\u201cThe second, to the supreme leader [Ayatollah Ali Khamenei], to tell him that unless and until he opens every military and every nuclear facility to real anytime, anywhere inspections \u2013 by our people, not his \u2013 we, the United States of America, will make it as difficult as possible [for Iran] to move money around the global financial system.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "CNS News", "description": "uring Wednesday night\u2019s Republican presidential debate candidates sparred over how \u2013 and even whether \u2013 the U.S. president should deal with foreign adversaries.", "title": "Trump: \u2018I Would Get Along With\u2019 Putin; Fiorina: \u2018I Wouldn\u2019t Talk to Him At All\u2019", "url": "http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/patrick-goodenough/gop-candidates-spar-over-how-deal-foreign-adversaries", "image": "//cdn.cnsnews.com/debate2-ap_0.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-09-17T16:49:02-04:00", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-17T02:45:31-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-17T16:49:02-04:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "uring Wednesday night\u2019s Republican presidential debate candidates sparred over how \u2013 and even whether \u2013 the U.S. president should deal with foreign adversaries.", "title": "Trump: \u2018I Would Get Along With\u2019 Putin; Fiorina: \u2018I Wouldn\u2019t Talk to Him At All\u2019", "url": "http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/patrick-goodenough/gop-candidates-spar-over-how-deal-foreign-adversaries", "image": {"src": "http://cdn.cnsnews.com/debate2-ap_0.jpg"}, "site": "@cnsnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "uring Wednesday night\u2019s Republican presidential debate candidates sparred over how \u2013 and even whether \u2013 the U.S. president should deal with foreign adversaries.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfb84\"", "article_summary": "The entrepreneur and GOP campaign frontrunner said he would talk to Putin and \u201cwould get along with him.\n\u201cDo we want someone with that kind of character, that kind of careless language to be negotiating with Putin?\u201d Paul asked, after Trump took a sideways swipe at him.\nBut I would get along with a lot of the world leaders that this country is not getting along with.\u201dSen.
