But, he argues, that would be more than offset by savings from ending high-cost private health insurance plans.\n\nYet, under his plan, the nation\u2019s 8.5 million seniors over the age of 65 and already eligible for Medicare would also get hit with tax increases. With more of the nation\u2019s baby boom generation working into traditional retirement years, the concern is that the costs to seniors are higher than Sanders' plan suggests.\n\n\u201cUnder Bernie\u2019s plan, everybody may well benefit, but there\u2019s going to be a substantial number of seniors who are going to feel like they\u2019re worse off,\u201d said John Rother, president of the National Coalition on Health Care, a nonpartisan coalition aiming to lower health costs. \u201cThese tradeoffs are inevitable in any kind of big picture health care plan.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s the latest critique to emerge since Sanders released the details of his plan hours before the last Democratic debate in Charleston. Most of the criticism has been that Sanders is promising a massive increase in benefits coverage for all Americans \u2013 including for dental, mental health, vision and hearing \u2013 while assuming considerable savings that are only vaguely detailed.\n\nThe concern over the potential impact on working seniors is just one example of problems that arise as details of the plan emerge, critics say.\n\nWarren Gunnels, Sanders chief policy adviser, said even working seniors subject to additional taxes stand to save. A senior working past the age of 65 making $50,000 per year would pay less than $840 for their health care, he said. A 2014 Kaiser Family Foundation report found the average senior pays $4,734 out of pocket for health care costs, meaning they would save more than $3,800 under Sanders' plan.\n\nAdditionally, most seniors working past the age of 65 have additional health insurance from their employers that include premiums, deductibles and co-payments. \u201cEvery senior citizen in this country with less than $250,000 in income would save thousands of dollars a year,\u201d said Gunnels. \u201cAnyone who claims otherwise is simply not telling the truth,\u201d he said.\n\nStill, Austan Goolsbee, the former chair of President Obama\u2019s economic council, said the Sanders campaign is being \u201ca little sneaky\u201d about the final tab for taxpayers, including working seniors.\n\nSanders\u2019 plan includes an additional 2.2% income tax for most Americans and a 6.2% payroll tax for all employers, in addition to an estate tax and higher federal rates on the wealthiest Americans.\n\n\u201cThe Sanders people are just using a sleight of hand,\u201d said Goolsbee, who is supporting Clinton but is not working on her campaign. \u201cThey\u2019re only counting the income tax part of the tax increase,\u201d and not the employer tax, he said. \u201cEmployers are going to make the employees pay that. If they didn\u2019t, a whole lot of these people would be laid off.\u201d\n\nAccording to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, employer tax rate increases are generally passed on to employees in the form of lower wages or higher prices.\n\nAs the race for the Democratic nomination tightens in the early voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire, Clinton and Sanders are dueling over competing visions for expanding health-care coverage. Clinton says Sanders would undo a decade\u2019s worth of Democratic work to expand benefits via Obamacare by pushing a plan that is unworkable and would never pass Congress.\n\nShe advocates building on Obamacare and pressuring drug companies to lower costs. Sanders says Obamacare isn\u2019t good enough, and that presidents including Franklin Roosevelt have supported a single-payer system that would dramatically lower costs by cutting out insurance companies and forcing pharmaceutical companies to negotiate prices with the government.\n\nThe Sanders campaign calculates a savings, said Gunnels, for seniors earning $50,000 a year even including the employer tax. \"FDR had a word for this line of attack,\" said Gunnels. \"FDR called it 'deceit.'\"\n\nSanders released details of his plan following pressure from Clinton and her allies. One independent analysis, by Gerald Friedman, an economist at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, found Sanders proposal would reduce health care spending in the U.S. by $6 trillion over the next 10 years. Sanders says the typical family earning $50,000 a year would save nearly $6,000 annually in health care costs.\n\nYet others, including Goolsbee, say the idea assumes that most people will value the health-care benefits they will receive over the tax increases they\u2019ll experience. Goolsbee, who helped craft Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act and wants to see it continued, estimates the Sanders plan would raise the government share of the economy by $20 trillion over ten years.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s talking about government spending as a share of GDP (gross domestic product) rising dramatically to the levels they are in France, Sweden, Denmark, the big social democracies in Europe, which we\u2019ve never had,\u201d said Goolsbee.\n\nThe potential downside for working seniors is among the specifics that need to be carefully considered when completely overhauling the current health-care system, said Rother.\n\n\u201cI have no stake in this race,\u201d he said. \u201cMedicare for all has been the slogan of a lot of people over the years, but it really is just a slogan. It doesn\u2019t really tell you much about how the program would work.\u2019\u2019", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "<p>Bernie Sanders\u2019\u00a0plan to deliver \u201cMedicare for all\u201d may be a good deal for many Americans, but it might be bad for\u00a0working seniors already enrolled in the government health plan.</p><p><img...", "author": "TEGNA", "og": {"site_name": "KARE", "description": "Bernie Sanders\u2019\u00a0plan to deliver \u201cMedicare for all\u201d may be a good deal for many Americans, but it might be bad for\u00a0working seniors already enrolled in the government health plan.", "title": "Sanders' 'Medicare for all' plan may not help working seniors", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://content.tegna-media.com/photo/2016/01/24/635892256379016232-BERNIE-SANDERS-1-_89881_ver1.0_640_360.JPG", "height": 360}, "url": "http://www.kare11.com/news/nation-now/sanders-medicare-for-all-plan-may-not-help-working-seniors/21880054", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "http://www.kare11.com", "description": "Bernie Sanders\u2019\u00a0plan to deliver \u201cMedicare for all\u201d may be a good deal for many Americans, but it might be bad for\u00a0working seniors already enrolled in the government health plan.", "title": "Sanders' 'Medicare for all' plan may not help working seniors", "image": {"src": "http://content.tegna-media.com/photo/2016/01/24/635892256379016232-BERNIE-SANDERS-1-_89881_ver1.0_640_360.JPG"}, "site": "@KARE 11", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"app_id": 178465835525119}, "keywords": "nation-now", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1280"}, "article_summary": "Bernie Sanders\u2019 plan to deliver \u201cMedicare for all\u201d may be a good deal for many Americans, but it might be bad for working seniors already enrolled in the government health plan.\nWith more of the nation\u2019s baby boom generation working into traditional retirement years, the concern is that the costs to seniors are higher than Sanders' plan suggests.\nThe potential downside for working seniors is among the specifics that need to be carefully considered when completely overhauling the current health-care system, said Rother.\nWarren Gunnels, Sanders chief policy adviser, said even working seniors subject to additional taxes stand to save.\nThe concern over the potential impact on working seniors is just one example of problems that arise as details of the plan emerge, critics say."}
