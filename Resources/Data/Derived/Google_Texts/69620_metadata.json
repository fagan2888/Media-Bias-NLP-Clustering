The commencement was part of the university\u2019s 250th anniversary.\n\nWhile the president\u2019s speech began with humorous references to the Garden State, including Rutgers grease trucks and fat sandwiches, and his goal of \u201cfinally settling this pork roll versus Taylor ham question,\u201d Obama also used the commencement stage as a platform to deliver a critique of Donald Trump.\n\nThe president spoke of the diversity within Rutgers, calling the university an \u201cintellectual melting pot.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmerica converges here and in so many ways the history of Rutgers mirrors the evolution of America,\u201d he said.\n\nReferencing the changes that have taken place since the turn of the century \u2014 from terrorist attacks to the recession \u2014 Obama said that while change is often unsteady, it\u2019s not subsiding in America.\n\n\u201cAmerica\u2019s progress has never been smooth or steady. Progress doesn\u2019t travel in a straight line. Progress in American has been hard and contentious\u2026it remains uneven,\u201d he said. \u201cThe pace of change is not subsiding, it is accelerating and these changes not only offer great opportunity but great peril. your generation has everything it takes to lead this country toward a brighter future.\u201d\n\nLook to the future\n\nThe president said he wasn\u2019t going to tell the Class of 2016 how to make the world better. \u201cYou\u2019ll figure it out,\u201d he said, adding that he had some suggestions.\n\nFirst, he told the graduates, \u201cwhen you hear someone longing for the good old days, take it with a grain of salt.\u201d\n\n\u201cGuess what, it ain\u2019t so. The good old days weren\u2019t all that good,\u201d he said.\n\nHe pointed to progress such as advances in gender equality and equal pay as well as the Affordable Care Act. The president said by almost every measure, America is better than it was 50 years ago, or even eight years ago.\n\n\u201cI say all these things not to make you complacent. We\u2019ve got a bunch of big problems to solve,\u201d he said. \u201cChange has been a constant in our history and the reason America is better is because we didn\u2019t look backwards. We didn\u2019t fear the future, we seized the future and made it our own.\u201d\n\nObama\u2019s speech then turned toward the 2016 presidential election with obvious references to probable GOP candidate Donald Trump\u2019s campaign.\n\nWalls won\u2019t keep us safe\n\n\u201cThe world is more interconnected than ever. Building a wall won\u2019t solve that,\u201d Obama said, alluding to Trump\u2019s idea to have a border wall built between the United States and Mexico. \u201cThe biggest challenges we face cannot be solved in isolation. To help ourselves, we\u2019ve got to help others. Not pull up the drawbridge and try to keep the world out.\u201d\n\nObama went on to tell the graduates that \u201csuggesting we can build an endless wall and blame our challenges on immigrants contradicts the evidence that our growth and innovation has been spurred by our ability to attract others from around the globe.\u201d\n\nObama also told the graduates that people who are placed in a position to make policy should value \u201cfacts, evidence, reason logic, and understanding of science.\n\n\u201cWe have traditionally valued those things but if you were listening to today\u2019s political debate you might wonder where this strain of anti-intellectualism came from,\u201d Obama said, also referencing Gov. Chris Christie\u2019s former \u201cTelling it like it is\u201d campaign slogan. Christie\u2019s bid for the Republican nomination ended in February and the governor endorsed Trump.\n\n\u201cIgnorance is not a virtue. It\u2019s not cool to not know what you\u2019re talking about. That\u2019s not keeping it real or telling it like it is,\u201d Obama said in his speech.\n\nPossible to make a difference\n\nObama said that affecting change isn\u2019t \u201chopeless\u201d despite obstacles.\n\n\u201cIf you wanna change this country for the better, you better start participating,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThe system isn\u2019t as rigged as you think, and it certainly isn\u2019t as hopeless as you think.\u201d\n\nMaking yet another Garden State reference, Obama quoted \u201chis friend\u201d Bruce Springsteen\u2019s hit \u201cBadlands,\u201d urging graduates to be persistent and have faith instead of giving in to cynicism and spending their lives \u201cwaiting for a moment that just don\u2019t come,\u201d as the song states.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re gonna have some setbacks,\u201d he told the graduates. \u201cYou have to stick with it. You have to be persistent. Don\u2019t lose hope if sometimes you hit a roadblock.\u201d\n\nJust before his address began, Obama was awarded an honorary degree by university president Robert Barchi, who called the president a \u201ctireless advocate of social justice.\u201d\n\nThe head of the university began his career at Rutgers four years ago, as many members of the Class of 2016 were beginning their freshman year.\n\n\u201cWe knew you were special. We knew you would be an historic class,\u201d Barchi said. \u201cYou are Rutgers\u2019 largest graduating class ever. You are among the most accomplished and most diverse at any university in the nation. One in every four of you is the first in his or her family to attend college.\u201d\n\nBarchi spoke of the class of 2016\u2019s accomplishments in academics, athletics and community service.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t given you all the answers but I hope we\u2019ve given you the intellectual curiosity to ask the right questions,\u201d Barchi said. \u201cAs you start your new lives as alumni, I have just one request: don\u2019t forget your unique place as the 250th anniversary class. Don\u2019t go out and make a fortune; make a difference.\u201d\n\nToniann Antonelli is a social content producer for NJ 101.5.
