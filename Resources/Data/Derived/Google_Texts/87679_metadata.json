Getty Images\n\nDenise Scott had just one day to go before she would feel free. \u201cTwo drops in the morning and two drops at night,\u201d Scott said of her last dose of liquid Klonopin. A disabled mother of two, Scott had been tapering off the panic-disorder medication for 40 weeks \u2014 an incremental measure taken to reduce what is commonly referred to by medical professionals as discontinuation syndrome, fiercely negative physical and psychological reactions to the decrease of such drugs in the system. Scott was prescribed the Benzodiazepine, Klonopin, along with a slew of antidepressants in 2011 after a cold-turkey attempt to stop taking Zoloft landed her in a psychiatric ward for extreme suicidal thoughts \u2014 a first for her. For Scott, getting off the Klonopin and the Zoloft felt more like horrible withdrawals from toxic substances, and she\u2019s not alone. While getting onto antidepressants is as simple as getting an increasingly common prescription and popping a pill, weaning off the drugs can seem insurmountable, if not impossible, because of these negative side effects. The result is an increasing number of Americans who have become married to their drugs to avoid the pain of getting off them. \u201cPeople can get started on the drugs for anxiety, obesity, menopause. You see people prescribe the drugs for anything under the sun,\u201d said Dr. Peter Breggin, an expert in psychiatric withdrawal with a private psychiatry practice in Ithaca, N.Y. \u201cI think they\u2019re among the most difficult drugs to come off \u2014 harder to come off than alcohol and opiates.\u201d \u201cMy first three months was really bad,\u201d Scott said by phone from her home in Andalusia, Ala. \u201cI had anxiety, heart palpitations, chest pains, panic attacks.\u201d Now 61, she has been on some form of antidepressant for 40 years. \u201cI had a very sad, traumatic childhood,\u201d said Scott, who was first prescribed an antidepressant by her general practitioner. \u201cI went to a regular doctor and told him I was feeling depressed. It was a short visit. He gave me Limbitrol.\u201d Long-term use of antidepressants has become increasingly common over the past decade, according to a recent National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey study. Some 70 percent of the estimated 16 million long-term users in the United States \u2014 defined as having used the drugs more than 24 months \u2014 are women. Data from IMS Health, as reported in a study published in the December Journal of Clinical Psychiatry by lead author Dr. Ramin Mojtabai, shows antidepressants are the most commonly prescribed medication class in the U.S. It links national trends in increased long-term use of antidepressants with treatment in primary-care settings, where most antidepressants are prescribed. Scott, who did not see a mental-health specialist until 2010, believes her general practitioners repeatedly misdiagnosed her. \u201cNobody\u2019s listening,\u201d Scott said. \u201cThey just prescribe.\u201d\n\nFalse positives\n\nWith the help of a nonprofit withdrawal program, Scott has been working to become antidepressant-free after finding out last year that she has thyroid disease as well as a hormonal imbalance. Working to address these underlying physical conditions, Scott said she feels better than she has in years. Experts disagree about the solution to what appears to be the overprescription of antidepressants to women at the primary-care level. Some feel general practitioners should be at the beginning of the diagnostic process, not the end. \u201cIndividuals with moderate or severe depression would probably need medication treatment and psychiatric referral,\u201d Mojtabai, an associate professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said in an email. Mojtabai published findings in the April issue of the journal Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics that found almost two-thirds of a sample of 5,000 patients diagnosed with depression within the previous year did not meet the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders criteria for a major depressive episode. Instead, the patients were given false positive diagnoses, according to Mojtabai\u2019s study. The Affordable Care Act will expand mental-health and substance-use-disorder benefits for 62 million Americans but does not address some systemic problems. \u201cIn the Affordable Care Act, mental health is one of the essential health benefits, but it isn\u2019t creating tons of psychiatrists,\u201d said Dr. Kenneth Duckworth, medical director for the National Alliance on Mental Illness, who noted access to psychiatrists is limited by many factors, such as location and restrictive insurance benefits. He said preventing improper use of antidepressants is both the doctor\u2019s and the patient\u2019s responsibility. \u201cPrimary-care doctors treat and help a lot of people,\u201d said Duckworth, who cautioned patients to open a dialogue with their doctor if they are being prescribed antidepressants for what are called off-label uses \u2014 ones not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration \u2014 like insomnia. Laurie Campbell, 46, said she her general practitioner prescribed the antidepressant Paxil for irritable bowel syndrome \u2014 an off-label use for the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Her doctor told her it would help her with the anxiety she experienced over feeling the need to be near a bathroom at all times, she said. \u201cI\u2019m the last person you\u2019d think of being depressed,\u201d said Campbell, an office manager from Croton, Ohio. That was 15 years ago. She said the drug changed her personality, affecting her ability to concentrate on reading, but she was unable to get off it. \u201cBoth times I tried to quit on my own, I had dry heaves, diarrhea. I tried to eat, and I gagged, I had akathisia, auditory hallucinations,\u201d she said. She finally sought help and was able to taper off the drug but felt it permanently affected her ability to concentrate and to read, which used to be one of her favorite pastimes. \u201cWomen have far more hormonal changes than men in their lives,\u201d said Dr. Samoon Ahmad, founder of Integrative Center for Wellness in New York. \u201cJust because something may be happening at a given point in their life doesn\u2019t mean they have a diagnosis of major depression.\u201d Robert Whitaker, author of \u201cAnatomy of an Epidemic,\u201d agreed that more analysis must be made at a diagnostic level before prescribing antidepressants, and he cautioned that these drugs can become a life sentence because of damage believed to be done to the brain after extended exposure. \u201cOverprescription is much more pronounced with women than with men,\u201d Whitaker said. \u201cWe just don\u2019t have good scientific evidence that antidepressants lead to an improved life course in the aggregate.\u201d But proof is hard to find. \u201cNo one cares,\u201d Whitaker said. \u201cNo one cares about what happens to the brain when you go on these drugs.\u201d\n\nLong-term damage?\n\nAlmost two-thirds of long-term adult users of antidepressants take SSRIs, according to recent data from the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. SSRIs affect serotonin levels in the brain. Experts disagree about what exactly happens to the brain when people come off these types of drugs. \u201cPractitioners are very reluctant to take people off and aren\u2019t trained in taking them off,\u201d said Dr. Larry Davidson, a professor of psychiatry at Yale University. \u201cIt\u2019s easier to stay on them.\u201d Asked what the exit strategy is for people using Cymbalta, for example, a spokeswoman for the drug\u2019s maker, Eli Lilly (which also makes Prozac), said in an email, \u201cThe Cymbalta product label includes warnings about when to take Cymbalta and symptoms that may be experienced at discontinuation.\u201d The company\u2019s guide (PDF) on the drug instructs patients not to stop taking it without talking to their health care providers, warning, \u201cStopping Cymbalta too quickly or changing from another antidepressant too quickly may result in serious symptoms,\u201d including anxiety, trouble sleeping, headaches, dizziness, shock-like sensations and more. A spokesman for Pfizer, which makes Zoloft, said in an email, \u201cIn Zoloft\u2019s U.S. prescribing information, a gradual reduction in the dose rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible. It is important that patients speak with their health care providers to discuss appropriate treatment options.\u201d \u201cAlmost anything emotionally and behaviorally destructive can happen during withdrawal because serotonin is the most widespread neurotransmitter in the brain,\u201d said Breggin, the psychiatric withdrawal expert. Coming off SSRIs can cause \u201call kinds of behavioral and neurological disturbances,\u201d he said, listing some common side effects, such as \u201cshocklike feelings in the head, imbalance, odd feelings in different parts of your body, depression, hopelessness, suicidal feelings and actions, disabling anxiety and persisting sexual dysfunction.\u201d But Breggin warned not to be discouraged by these side effects, since it is not yet known whether any damage is irreversible. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason to come off,\u201d he said. \u201cYou want to try as best as you can to withdraw, because it\u2019s only going to get worse in time.\u201d\n\n\u2018No turning back\u2019", "article_metadata": {"description": "Patients, mostly women, can face severe withdrawal after discontinuation; experts say no real exit strategy exists", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.aljazeera.simple", "og": {"url": "http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/1/22/patients-mostly-womenfindtroublegettingoffofantidepressants.html", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/articles/2014/1/22/patients-mostly-womenfindtroublegettingoffofantidepressants/jcr:content/image.img.jpg", "height": 800}, "type": "article", "description": "Patients, mostly women, can face severe withdrawal after discontinuation; experts say no real exit strategy exists", "title": "Waking up from sadness: Many have trouble getting off antidepressants"}, "twitter": {"site": "@AJAM", "image": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/articles/2014/1/22/patients-mostly-womenfindtroublegettingoffofantidepressants/jcr:content/image.img.jpg", "description": "Patients, mostly women, can face severe withdrawal after discontinuation; experts say no real exit strategy exists", "card": "summary", "title": "Waking up from sadness: Many have trouble getting off antidepressants"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=810543104, affiliate-data=10lxKx", "keywords": "Women's Rights, Pharmaceuticals, Prescription Drugs, Health", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd40c\"", "article_summary": "It links national trends in increased long-term use of antidepressants with treatment in primary-care settings, where most antidepressants are prescribed.\nWhile getting onto antidepressants is as simple as getting an increasingly common prescription and popping a pill, weaning off the drugs can seem insurmountable, if not impossible, because of these negative side effects.\nExperts disagree about the solution to what appears to be the overprescription of antidepressants to women at the primary-care level.\nSome 16 million people in the U.S., mostly women, are estimated to be long-term users of antidepressants.\nFor Scott, getting off the Klonopin and the Zoloft felt more like horrible withdrawals from toxic substances, and she\u2019s not alone."}
