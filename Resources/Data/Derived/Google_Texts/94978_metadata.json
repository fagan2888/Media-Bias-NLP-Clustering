They are blazing a trail,\u201d Cheryl Smith said in an interview with the Arkansas News Bureau.\n\nSmith, the former director of Utah\u2019s health insurance exchange, accepted the Arkansas job on Monday and will report to work May 19. The marketplace\u2019s board of directors set her annual salary at $165,000.\n\nSmith will be responsible for hiring and supervising a staff and will lead the effort to determine whether Arkansas would be better served by switching from a marketplace run by a federal-state partnership to a state-run marketplace.\n\nThe marketplace is an exchange, created in accordance with the federal Affordable Care Act, where Arkansans can shop for insurance plans that suit their needs and apply for federal subsidies.\n\nSmith was director of the Utah Health Exchange from 2008 to 2010. The exchange began operating in 2009, before the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010, as a small-group exchange. After the federal law was passed, Utah obtained permission to continue running the small-group exchange and let the federal government run the exchange for individuals.\n\n\u201cThis is what I like about creative thinking. Utah was actually able to get some stuff written into federal administrative rule\u201d to allow the division of responsibilities, Smith said.\n\nSmith is now a consultant with Deloitte Consulting. She admitted that she is taking a pay cut to come to Arkansas.\n\n\u201cThe money wasn\u2019t nearly as important to me as the opportunity,\u201d she said.\n\nSmith said she is attracted to the innovation Arkansas showed in creating the so-called private option. Instead of expanding the state Medicaid rolls to include people earning up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level, as proposed by the Affordable Care Act, the state is using federal Medicaid money to subsidize private insurance, purchased through the insurance marketplace, for that population.\n\n\u201cI appreciate that kind of thinking. I want to be a part of it,\u201d Smith said.\n\nSteve Faris, chairman of the marketplace board\u2019s search committee, said Tuesday he was impressed by Smith\u2019s resume, which includes work in the Utah governor\u2019s office and as staff to legislative leadership on health-care reform initiatives.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s got legislative experience, which will help because she\u2019ll have to go before (a legislative) oversight committee, and also she has, most importantly, experience of the subject matter,\u201d Faris said.\n\nSherrill Wise, the board\u2019s chairman, said in a news release Tuesday, \u201cSmith has a well-rounded base of experience including strategy, policy, creation and implementation of health exchanges that we expect will prove valuable as we navigate through setting up a state-based health insurance exchange in Arkansas.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "LITTLE ROCK \u2014 The newly hired executive director of the Arkansas Health Insurance Marketplace said Tuesday she is excited to work in a state that is exploring uncharted territory with its approach to expanding Medicaid.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "John Lyon Arkansas News Bureau jlyon@arkansasnews.com", "og": {"site_name": "Arkansas News", "description": "LITTLE ROCK \u2014 The newly hired executive director of the Arkansas Health Insurance Marketplace said Tuesday she is excited to work in a state that is exploring uncharted territory with its approach to expanding Medicaid.", "title": "Newly hired insurance marketplace director excited about Arkansas\u2019 innovation", "url": "http://arkansasnews.com/news/arkansas/newly-hired-insurance-marketplace-director-excited-about-arkansas-innovation", "image": "http://arkansasnews.com/sites/arkansasnews.com/files/field/media/web1_cheryl-smith.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://arkansasnews.com/news/arkansas/newly-hired-insurance-marketplace-director-excited-about-arkansas-innovation", "image": {"src": "http://arkansasnews.com/sites/arkansasnews.com/files/field/media/web1_cheryl-smith.jpg"}, "title": "Newly hired insurance marketplace director excited about Arkansas\u2019 innovation", "card": "summary", "creator": "@arkansasnews"}, "keywords": "Arkansas,News,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-04-01T18:20:18-06:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0f20\"", "article_summary": "LITTLE ROCK \u2014 The newly hired executive director of the Arkansas Health Insurance Marketplace said Tuesday she is excited to work in a state that is exploring uncharted territory with its approach to expanding Medicaid.\nSmith, the former director of Utah\u2019s health insurance exchange, accepted the Arkansas job on Monday and will report to work May 19.\nSmith was director of the Utah Health Exchange from 2008 to 2010.\nThey are blazing a trail,\u201d Cheryl Smith said in an interview with the Arkansas News Bureau.\nSmith said she is attracted to the innovation Arkansas showed in creating the so-called private option."}
