It\u2019s better than surgery.\u201d\n\nThe tried-and-true treatment for Achilles tendinitis is surgical repair, said Dr. Troy Watson, an orthopedic surgeon at Desert Orthopaedic Center. The recovery takes almost a year. But PRP, which isn\u2019t invasive like surgery, can help speed recovery. Some patients may return to normal activity within a few weeks.\n\nAbout three years ago, Watson began offering PRP to patients who had foot and ankle injuries. Recently, he administered it to a patient who had tennis elbow. It\u2019s still experimental but many people have reported good outcomes from it, he said. Annually, more than 86,000 athletes receive PRP injections in the United States, according to the National Institutes of Health.\n\nIt was initially believed to give athletes a competitive edge because it contained growth factors, which is why it was temporarily banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency. That ban was lifted in 2011.\n\n\u201cThe science behind it makes sense,\u201d Watson said. \u201cI think we\u2019re really on the cutting edge with this.\u201d\n\nPRP is a procedure that uses the patient\u2019s own blood as a healing catalyst. Watson draws a small amount of blood from the patient, then spins it in a centrifuge, separating the platelets from the red blood cells.\n\n\u201cPlatelet-rich plasma has a bunch of growth factors,\u201d Watson explains. \u201cThese are molecules that turn on other cells that help in the recovery process. We\u2019re hoping they turn on the healing cells.\u201d\n\nSeveral pro athletes, including Tiger Woods, Hines Ward and Carmelo Anthony, have received PRP for various injuries. That has increased interest among the public, even weekend warriors, Watson said.\n\nLas Vegan Glenus Cooper, 60, was training for a half-marathon two years ago when she injured her Achilles tendon. She continued to train, thinking she could just run through the pain. When it came time to run the race, she could barely walk. So she hobbled the 13 miles. That night, her calf throbbed and ached so much, she couldn\u2019t sleep.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not one to go to the doctor for running injuries,\u201d Cooper said.\n\nThat was her old attitude. Now, she understands just how debilitating a minor injury can become if not properly treated. Recently, she had an MRI that showed her Achilles tendon was torn. Her options were: live with it and limit her activities or have surgery.\n\nWatson presented PRP as an option, too.\n\n\u201cTo me, it sounded doable,\u201d she said.\n\nThe procedure wasn\u2019t covered by insurance so she had to pay the $500 on her own. But Cooper said the cost is a lot cheaper than surgery. After wearing a boot for four weeks to immobilize her foot, she was almost completely cured.\n\nCooper\u2019s still taking it easy, alternating slow jogging with walking. But she completed a half-marathon in June and plans to do another one. She puts her recovery at about 99 percent.\n\nBogere had one PRP injection in March and wore a boot on his foot for a month. Though his mobility returned, he still felt pain so he went in for another PRP injection recently.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m praying to God and everything to get better,\u201d Bogere said. \u201cI\u2019m positive about it. I can\u2019t wait to go back to work and do what I do best.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"parsely-link": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/life/health/recovery-formula-straight-your-veins", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "SONYA PADGETT LAS VEGAS REVIEW-JOURNAL", "parsely-title": "Recovery formula, straight from your veins", "twitter": {"description": "When professional boxer Sharif Bogere aggravated a nagging Achilles injury during a fight in March, it seemed as though recovery would sideline his career indefinitely.", "title": "Recovery formula, straight from your veins", "url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/life/health/recovery-formula-straight-your-veins", "image": {"src": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_prpinject_082613CS_008.jpg, http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_prpinject_082613CS_005.jpg, http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_prpinject_082613CS_006.jpg, http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_prpinject_082613CS_004.jpg, http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_prpinject_082613CS_007.jpg, http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_prpinject_082613CS_003.jpg, http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_prpinject_082613CS_009.jpg"}, "creator": {"identifier": "@reviewjournal", "id": 15358759}, "card": "summary"}, "description": "When professional boxer Sharif Bogere aggravated a nagging Achilles injury during a fight in March, it seemed as though recovery would sideline his career indefinitely.", "vf": {"unique_id": "reviewjournal-nid-800446"}, "al": {"web": {"should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"url": "review-journal://?eid=161656", "app_name": "review-journal", "package": "com.LVRJ"}, "ios": {"url": "review-journal://?eid=161656", "app_store_id": 540820524, "app_name": "review-journal"}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=540820524", "fb": {"admins": 630759385, "app_id": 195491203833571}, "google-play-app": "app-id=com.LVRJ", "og": {"site_name": "Las Vegas Review-Journal", "description": "When professional boxer Sharif Bogere aggravated a nagging Achilles injury during a fight in March, it seemed as though recovery would sideline his career indefinitely.", "title": "Recovery formula, straight from your veins", "url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/life/health/recovery-formula-straight-your-veins", "image": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_prpinject_082613CS_008.jpg", "type": "article"}, "parsely-author": "SONYA PADGETT LAS VEGAS REVIEW-JOURNAL", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "Health,,", "parsely-section": "Health", "article": {"published_time": "2013-10-13T18:29:13-07:00"}, "parsely-tags": "Health", "parsely-image-url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_prpinject_082613CS_008.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9", "parsely-pub-date": "2013-10-14T01:29:13Z"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd92d\"", "article_summary": "But PRP, which isn\u2019t invasive like surgery, can help speed recovery.\nAbout three years ago, Watson began offering PRP to patients who had foot and ankle injuries.\nWhen professional boxer Sharif Bogere aggravated a nagging Achilles injury during a fight in March, it seemed as though recovery would sideline his career indefinitely.\n\u201cThese are molecules that turn on other cells that help in the recovery process.\n\u201cI think we\u2019re really on the cutting edge with this.\u201dPRP is a procedure that uses the patient\u2019s own blood as a healing catalyst."}
