ROUGH CUT (NO REPORTER NARRATION) U.S. President Barack Obama took his weekly presidential web/radio address to reflect on some of his administration's accomplishments in 2015, and looked forward to 2016 as a year to focus his efforts on stopping gun violence in America. He said U.S. unemployment is down, more Americans are insured under the Affordable Healthcare Act, the United States depending less on foreign oil, and gay marriage were some of the highlights of 2015. But he said the "unfinished business" of gun violence remains, calling on Congress to pass legislation to protect future generations.
