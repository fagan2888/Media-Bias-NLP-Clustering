The acquisition is expected to expand Sutter Care at Home\u2019s home health services and programs in Monterey County, California.\n\nAlliance Home Health provides a full array of homecare services, including occupational therapy, skilled nursing, speech therapy, physical therapy, home health aide services and medical social services. With the addition of Monterey County, Sutter Care at Home provides home health services in 24 Northern California counties.\n\nAs a for-profit organization, Alliance Home Health is set to become a part of the not-for-profit Sutter Health system.\n\nWell Care Home Health Inc. Buys Davie County, North Carolina\u2019s Home Health Agency for $1.8 Million\n\nDavie County, North Carolina, commissioners have approved the sale of the home health care agency operated by the county to a private company for $1.8 million.\n\nThe buyer was Wilmington, North Carolina-based Well Care Home Health Inc., which officially took over the county\u2019s home health agency on Dec. 14.\n\nAll 17 employees of Davie\u2019s home health care agency will be offered jobs with Well Care, with no cut in pay, County Manager Mike Ruffin told commissioners.\n\nRuffin announced last year that the county was trying to get out of the home health care business, citing its increasing unprofitability.\n\nIn a statement, Ruffin said changes in home health services reimbursements have affected the department\u2019s revenues. He added that the Affordable Care Act has also resulted in a decrease in payment rates, making profitability almost impossible.\n\n\u201cThe financial loss the department is experiencing makes the timing of the sale critical,\u201d Ruffin said in the statement. \u201cWe are in a position where selling the department now allows us to sell the agency for a respectable profit as it is attractive to private companies who are looking to expand their footprint into the Davie County area.\u201d\n\nBeebe Healthcare Home Care Services Introduces Expanded Leadership Team\n\nMillsboro, Delaware-based Beebe Healthcare Home Care Services, a not-for-profit community health care system, announced its new leadership team.\n\n\u201cWith the growth in the aging population in southern Delaware, and the corresponding growth of our team members and services, we saw the need to expand our leadership team,\u201d said Dana Warrington, director of Beebe Home Care Services.\n\nWarrington was promoted to director in May after working for Beebe Home Care Services for 17 years as a staff nurse, case manager, clinical team lead and nurse manager.\n\nMichele Dennis, who has over five years of experience in critical and long-term care, was promoted to Clinical Team Lead in October. She has been a nurse with Beebe Home Care Services for over a year.\n\nMaureen Adair, who has worked as a nurse at Beebe Home Care Services for seven years, was promoted to the role of nurse manager in October.\n\nAudrey Moore, who has worked as a nurse with Beebe Home Care Services for two years, has been promoted to Team Lead Quality Assurance. Moore has over seven years of experience in home care nursing.\n\nAdditional leadership team members are Janet Davis, manager of coding, and a clinical documentation specialist; and Maggie Kniele, Manager of Rehabilitation Services.\n\nBeebe Home Care Services offers in-home nursing services, as well as occupational therapy, physical therapy, speech therapy and consultation with social workers.

It has 400 employees who serve approximately 5,000 patients in their homes or living facilities, in addition to around 800 hospice patients, including those in its 10-bed hospice, and about 260 \u201cprivate duty\u201d clients who receive services not covered by Medicare.\n\nConcord VNA has expanded greatly over the last 20 years to meet the region\u2019s needs, with its budget increasing approximately tenfold in 18 years, Slepian said.\n\n\u201cWe are pretty passionate about helping people aging in place,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want to deliver high quality of care in the home.\u201d\n\nSlepian joined Concord VNA 2.5 years ago.
