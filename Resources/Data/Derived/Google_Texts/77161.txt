California assemblywoman Shannon Grove suggested this week abortion is the reason for California’s devastating drought.

Jezebel reported Grove said so during a legislative banquet last week in Sacramento; Grove herself represents Kern County in The Golden State. She said Texas endured a similar, long-period drought “until Governor Perry signed the fetal pain bill.” Assuming this “pain bill” refers to the Texas House Bill, or HB 2, this bill requires state abortion providers to emulate hospital-style surgical centers. As a result, most of the state’s abortion clinics will close.

Not only did Perry show his support for HB 2, but it also rained that night — so to Grove, this means anti-abortion legislation and God are what improved Texas’ drought.

Jezebel added that Grove backpedaled on her Facebook page as she replied to a commenter who posted a story concerning her comments.

“I believe — and most Americans believe — that God’s hand is in the affairs of man, and certainly was in the formation of this country.” Grove wrote. “The Founders put God in the center of this nation by recognizing Him as a giver of our rights. Is this drought caused by God? Nobody knows. But biblical history shows a consequence to man’s actions; we do know for sure that California’s water shortage crisis has been compounded by liberal politicians’ poor decisions — not properly managing our water resources and refusing to build water storage for decades.”

Meanwhile, California regulators have ordered more than 100 growers and irrigation districts to stop sourcing from “drought-starved rivers and streams in the Central Valley,” the Los Angeles Times reported. In January, Governor Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency, and he urges Californians to keep with measures in place in order to see relief, which is currently projected to be about a year from now.
