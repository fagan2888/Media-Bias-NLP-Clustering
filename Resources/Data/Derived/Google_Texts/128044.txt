My business was doing well. But group health insurance rates kept rising and rising, much faster than our revenues and profits.

In fact, over the last year, our group health insurance rates jumped almost 6 percent, while inflation has gone up less than 1 percent. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, group health insurance for families cost $16,625 per employee last year.

Worse, contracting with group health insurers and managing benefits for employees added expense, distraction and time commitment I couldn't afford. My firm, Collective Alternative, is in the business of marketing, not administering health benefits.

In talking with several other business owners about group health insurance, I found that we all seemed to be in the same sinking boat.
