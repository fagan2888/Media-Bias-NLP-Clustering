But the Oct. 1 opening of the federal health law\u2019s online insurance marketplace spurred the state to act, spokeswoman Stephanie Goodman said Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWe moved that work to state staff because we needed to move all our cases into one computer system so we\u2019d only have to connect one system to the federal marketplace,\u201d she said.\n\nOn Jan. 1, the federal law also will change eligibility rules for Medicaid and the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program \u2014 mostly in highly technical ways. That was another incentive to make the switch.\n\nMaximus Inc. of Reston, Va., which has run the CHIP eligibility system in recent years, laid off 110 of the 144 employees affected. The rest were reassigned to call centers and other support services the company provides for the state, Goodman said.\n\nGoodman said giving state employees the CHIP screening tasks for the first time doesn\u2019t signal dissatisfaction with Maximus or lingering problems with the state\u2019s partly privatized eligibility system. But an official of the Texas State Employees Union criticized the contractor\u2019s performance.\n\nMaximus\u2019 workers often made mistakes in processing CHIP cases, said Myko Gedutiz, lead organizer for the union. It has called on the state to use savings on its three-year, $315.3 million contract with the company to hire more eligibility workers.\n\nLeslie Wolfe, president of Maximus\u2019 unit handling the Texas contract, disputed the union\u2019s contention.\n\n\u201cWe have met or exceeded the performance metrics of our contract,\u201d Wolfe said. She noted that CHIP enrollment is at an all-time high of nearly 608,000 youngsters. She also said customer satisfaction is at record levels.\n\nGoodman, the state spokeswoman, called the union\u2019s criticism \u201ccompletely baseless.\u201d\n\nShe acknowledged, though, that Maximus employees shared responsibility with the state Department of Aging and Disability Services for a recent mix-up. Nearly 10,000 elderly and disabled Texans received by mistake a letter announcing they\u2019d be shifted into a Medicaid managed care plan.\n\nFollow Robert T.
