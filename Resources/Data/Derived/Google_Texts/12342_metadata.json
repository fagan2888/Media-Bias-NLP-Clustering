The opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympics represented everything that was great about the Games: openness, self-confidence and unblemished, almost childlike joy \u2013 all fuelled by our own delight that, when the pressure is on, Britain can still produce the very best in the world.\n\nThat success was built on two things, the Olympic spirit and Olympic delivery.\n\nThe Olympic spirit was there for all to feel: a city and a nation pulled together. But if the spirit created the magic, it was the delivery that made it happen. The Games were a triumph of the British soul because, more prosaically, they were a triumph of organisation.\n\nToday, London faces a challenge every bit as demanding \u2013 the housing crisis. The solution lies in translating that Olympic spirit and Olympic delivery for today.\n\nFirst, the Olympic spirit: a strong vision and shared purpose. My vision is clear \u2013 every Londoner should have a place to call home. That\u2019s how we\u2019ll build One London. London must not become a city where nurses, teachers and carers can\u2019t afford to live in the communities they serve, or where the young are driven out by the eye-watering expense of setting out on their own.\n\nWe all have a stake in making this work. But it\u2019s not enough to care, we have to act. People won\u2019t believe politicians\u2019 boastful promises and rightly so. There must be a real, deliverable plan.\n\nI\u2019ll admit I couldn\u2019t have done this job 20 years ago. But today I\u2019m confident the lessons of the Olympics hold the key. Here\u2019s how.\n\nFirst, we have to bring housebuilding under the direct control of the capital\u2019s mayor. If elected, I would establish \u201cHomes for Londoners\u201d, to get the city building again for the first time in decades \u2013 starting on the mayor\u2019s own land.\n\nThrough Transport for London, the mayor owns enough land to fill the entire borough of Camden. And that\u2019s just for starters. Other parts of the public sector can deliver housebuilding capacity, too: Network Rail, the NHS, the Ministry of Defence and local authorities. Where we can, we should build on that land \u2013 both rent-to-buy properties to help first-time buyers afford a home without the need for unaffordable deposits, as well as high-quality and genuinely affordable rented accommodation and social homes to preserve and renew the mixed communities that make London so great.\n\nHow? Through the very delivery model that built the Olympics. Instead of relying on a developer, we created the Olympic Delivery Authority to produce the plans and set expectations. We then hired the best people in the world to form a partner organisation responsible for managing construction. This provided the necessary management infrastructure to set new standards in construction, allowing us to invest in the training and skills of those on site, reducing the overall number of contractors by 6,000 and saving hundreds of millions of pounds.\n\nThis is how we can get City Hall building again. And it\u2019s working already. There\u2019s a place where the Olympics and great housing development overlap \u2013 it\u2019s called East Village. Once the Athletes\u2019 Village during the Games, now it has quality housing, with 50 per cent of the homes classed as affordable. It\u2019s home to carers, single mothers, academics and sales assistants, and it\u2019s officially the best new place to live in London.\n\nAs Mayor of London, I would make tackling the housing crisis my number one priority. By harnessing the Olympic spirit and Olympic delivery, I\u2019m confident that, just like three years ago, together we\u2019ll get the job done.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u201cIsles of Wonder\u201d, Danny Boyle\u2019s masterpiece, captivated the world three years ago today.
