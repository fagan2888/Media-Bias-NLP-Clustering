The wooden dashboard \u2014 whose contours recalled a handlebar mustache \u2014 still looked polished. The seatbelts, installed many years ago, were aftermarket accessories.\n\nThe gauges and controls looked straight out of the 1930s, because essentially, they were. A successor to the MG TC that had endeared itself to American G.I.\u2019s after World War II, the TD, introduced in 1949, was designed specifically for America\u2019s burgeoning sports-car market.\n\nAlthough its body design still followed the style of MG\u2019s prewar T-series models, the TD was given an upgraded chassis, including an independent front suspension to improve the ride quality and rack-and-pinion steering for more confident cornering. Most important for the United States was the TD\u2019s left-hand drive, which the TC did not offer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very easy to drive,\u201d Randy said, explaining that the MG\u2019s steering, clutch, and gearshift operated with a lightness that, to him, feel like the controls of modern cars.\n\nThe ride seemed compliant and taut, even over railroad crossings. Radial tires on the original vented steel wheels were a big help in that regard, Randy suggested.\n\n\u201cIt holds the road surprisingly well,\u201d he continued. \u201cI tried the original-type tires, but the ride and handling were terrible.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nRandy dispelled one myth about old British sports cars, describing the MG\u2019s convertible top as easy to use, and side curtains with plastic windows can be installed for a bit of weather protection when needed. But there\u2019s no heater.\n\n\u201cIn winter, you wear a blanket on your lap,\u201d Randy said. Some engine heat seeps into the cabin, helping to warm legs, but on a cool day multiple layers are a wise choice.\n\nReturning to Duke Farms, Morty joined his nephew for coffee in the park\u2019s cafe, each man carrying items for an impromptu show-and-tell at one of the tables.\n\n\u201cMorty, you go first,\u201d Randy said.\n\nFrom a worn Pan Am flight bag that he was using as a satchel, Morty pulled the car\u2019s original workshop manual. Randy looked on fondly as his uncle then sorted through photos, cards and other papers in an overstuffed wallet. In the memorabilia Morty retrieved were laminated pictures of the MG with his favorite passenger, a street mutt that wandered into his electrical supply business in the Bronx in 1988.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s Lucky Dog,\u201d Morty said. \u201cWhen I would open up the warehouse in the morning, this stray dog would run from across the street to stare at me. He was in rough shape. One day my wife drove out to see. She opened her car door, and the dog jumped in.\u201d\n\nTelling the story of his adopted dog, who died about 10 years ago, Morty began to choke back his words.\n\n\u201cHe loved to ride in the MG,\u201d Morty said.\n\nRandy paused to give his uncle a moment and then took his turn.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got something for you,\u201d he said, handing his uncle a package to unwrap. Inside was a framed glass mosaic of the MG \u2014 with Lucky Dog in the driver\u2019s seat.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s by your daughter,\u201d Randy said, explaining that he had commissioned Lauren Mehrberg, an artist in Massachusetts, to create the mosaic. Morty marveled at the detail, especially the grille and hood louvers, and of course his beloved pet. The car, though not especially valuable, holds the status of a family heirloom.\n\n\u201cThe MG was in his will for me, but he didn\u2019t want me to wait to enjoy it,\u201d Randy said, and then asked Morty to recount the story of how he got the car.\n\n\u201cWhen I got out of the Army, I bought a \u201957 MGA,\u201d Morty began, referring to the sleek successor of the T-series cars. \u201cThat was my first car, but I sold it. I wasn\u2019t really looking for another sports car, but I saw an ad for the TD for $650.\u201d\n\nThe seller was an auto shop teacher at a high school in the Bronx. The car, which Morty said was in very good condition, already had its distinctive, though nonoriginal, black-and-gold paint scheme.\n\n\u201cFor a long time, it was my only car,\u201d Morty said. \u201cI used it to go on sales calls.\u201d\n\nHe commuted from Manhasset to the Bronx and would park the car inside his warehouse. Later, he bought an apartment in Manhattan, where he parked the car on the street.\n\n\u201cThere was a lot of car vandalism in the city, but I never had a problem,\u201d he said.\n\nMorty drove the MG in all seasons but avoided long trips, which he said could be tiring. To improve traction when it snowed, he secured two 50-pound sand bags on the luggage rack behind the gas tank. The MG does not have a trunk.\n\n\u201cI always took care of it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe odometer shows 48,000 miles, but it\u2019s probably 68,000.\u201d\n\nMorty had the MG repainted once, keeping the black and gold design. Randy had it painted again when the car became his.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI thought about painting it red,\u201d Randy said. \u201cIt turns out that was the original color. I decided to keep the black and gold \u2014 to keep it authentic to Morty.\u201d\n\nMorty said he never considered replacing the MG with a more modern sports car. He still has the apartment in Manhattan, where he keeps and drives a 1967 Citro\u00ebn 2CV, a minuscule 2-cylinder French economy car known as the Deux Chevaux.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a big spender, but when I see something interesting, with character that I really like, I get it,\u201d he said.\n\nThirteen years ago, Morty bought a 1993 Land Rover Defender 110, one of 500 the company imported that year. He recently gave that British-built 4-wheel-drive S.U.V. to a friend\u2019s daughter when she graduated from the United States Merchant Marine Academy.\n\nSoon, the MG will be moving west. Randy, who spent five years in charge of building large-scale solar electricity installations in several states for a New Jersey-based renewable energy company, recently started a new position as general counsel for Vail Resorts in Colorado. Appropriately, Randy drives a Tesla Model S, and his wife, Michele, has a Lexus hybrid. Their son Sam, 21, doesn\u2019t gravitate toward the MG because it lacks modern technology, preferring his parents\u2019 cars.\n\n\u201cEric, my 12-year old, really likes the MG,\u201d Randy said. \u201cHe enjoys when I drive him to his baseball and soccer games in it. I think it\u2019s partly because of the attention from the other kids.\u201d\n\nRandy\u2019s daughter, Dillon, 25, also has a soft spot for the MG. As Morty picked up the mosaic to admire it again, Randy described a drawing Dillon had done of the car with the family\u2019s Portuguese water dog, Odie, sitting inside.\n\n\u201cMorty,\u201d Randy said, \u201cin her drawing, Odie looks like Lucky Dog.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "feature", "ptime": 20140131172701, "twitter": {"description": "About 40 years ago, the uncle of a New Jersey man taught his nephew how to drive in a 1952 MG TD.
