Second St.\n\nThe Beethoven work is significant, as the Elias quartet earlier this year began a series of performances at London Wigmore Hall that will encompass all the string quartets Beethoven wrote. Each concert in this Beethoven cycle, which will take 18 months to complete, will be recorded.\n\nSunday's concert will feature the second of the so-called \"Razumovsky\" Quartets, the Quartet No. 8 in E Minor, Op. 59, No. 2.\n\nAlso on the program is \"Reed Stanzas,\" a quartet by the English composer Sally Beamish, written in 2011 and inspired by the Scottish landscape where the composer now lives. Rounding out the program will be the Quartet in F Major, Op. 77, No. 2, Hob. III:82, by Haydn.\n\nTickets are $5-$25. 918-596-7111, myticketoffice.com\n\nJames D.

Brady St.\n\nThe exhibit, which draws a great deal from a local collector, features some of the myriad ways contemporary artists have dealt with the challenge of painting the human face.\n\nAmong the artists included in the show are Michael Ananian, Frank Auerbach, Robert Bauer, Susanna Coffey, Ann Gail, Sedrick Huckaby, Ruth Miller, Wilbur Niewald, Clifton Peacock and David Stern.\n\nIn his curator's statement, Lewis said, \"The painters in this exhibition are utilizing light, form, pigment and time to touch, measure, construct, configure, conjure, discover and invent. (They) share their perceptions, their personal reflections and the people around them, touch-by-touch, accumulating one painted thought to the next.\n\n\"At times these paintings offer moments of poignant observations or insight into the tools of abstraction,\" Lewis writes. \"They do not merely create appearances but also establish a presence.\"\n\nThe exhibit will be on display through April 13.
