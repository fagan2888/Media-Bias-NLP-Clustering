What do you wish you'd done differently?\n\nTOLD MONICA THE TRUTH!\n\nYou were worried about what Hayden would think of you getting voted out before the merge, and he assured you that nothing about your relationship would change. Where do you two stand now?\n\nWe are very much in love and can\u2019t wait for another opportunity to compete again. We are hoping to live in the same state soon and see where life will take us!\n\nPHOTOS: Jeff Probst's 'Survivor' Picture Diary\n\nIt appeared to be an agonizing decision about whether to swap places at Redemption Island, but you ended up losing the duel and were sent packing. Looking back, do you wish he'd switched places with you?\n\nIdeally, I would have liked to play more and really see how far I would go after being sent to Redemption Island from my tribe, but as a team we were able to make the right decision when it come to the million dollars. Yes, there could be possibilities that I would have done well, but because I was eliminated there could be a small chance of doubt somewhere and we did not want to take that chance! So I\u2019m praying Hayden brings me home the money! #TeamHat\n\nWhy did you believe that Hayden had a better chance of winning the whole thing than you?\n\nHello -- it's Hayden Moss, he\u2019s the greatest there ever was! Kidding, he a very smart, knows when to speak and clearly when to listen. Really great player of the game!\n\nWould you play Survivora third time if asked?\n\nSurvivor? Absolutely! Although Hayden and I would play any game anytime.\n\nSurvivor: Blood vs. Waterairs at 8 p.m. Wednesdays on CBS.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Kimberly Nordyke", "description": "The two-time player tells THR what she would have done differently and whether she'd play again.", "og": {"site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "description": "The two-time player tells THR what she would have done differently and whether she'd play again.", "title": "'Survivor: Blood vs. Water': Kat Edorsson on Not Making the Merge and Letting Down Boyfriend Hayden Moss", "url": "http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/survivor-blood-water-kat-edorsson-652819", "image": {"width": 1047, "identifier": "//cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2013/08/103341_D00624b_a_p.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 1572}, "type": "website"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-11-03 17:52:18", "sailthru.title": "'Survivor: Blood vs. Water': Kat Edorsson on Not Making the Merge and Letting Down Boyfriend Hayden Moss", "fb": {"admins": 3111204}, "sailthru.vertical": "Live Feed", "sailthru.tags": "Live Feed, Television, Survivor", "sailthru.channel": "Live Feed", "sailthru.description": "The two-time player tells THR what she would have done differently and whether she'd play again.", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd88eb\"", "article_summary": "You made a big move by trying to get Monica voted out, but your alliance thought you were untrustworthy as a result.\nAfter trying to vote out Monica Culpepper, who was in her alliance, her group found her to be untrustworthy and sent her to Redemption Island.\n(She also was voted out of Survivor: One World after proving herself unpredictable to her then-alliance.)\nKat Edorsson didn't make it to the merge on her second shot at playing Survivor, and that was a source of much emotion for the two-time competitor.\nThere, the 23-year-old student from Orlando lost the duel to John Cody and Laura Morett and was sent packing."}
