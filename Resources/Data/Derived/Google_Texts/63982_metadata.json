But now it has added two ambulances that will provide the basic life support and advanced life support of traditional ambulances, using EMTs and paramedics.\n\n\n\nIt also opened a call center where health care providers can call for consultation on a patient\u2019s transport-services need\u2014even if the answer is a non-IU Health ambulance service.\n\n\n\nNine hundred fifty-nine entities are certified to provide ambulance services in Indiana, about 400 of which are actively operating, according to the Indiana State Department of Health and the Indiana Department of Homeland Security. They range from township fire departments to private ambulance companies to high-end services like LifeLine.\n\n\n\nLeonard, the hospital association president, called it a \u201cpatchwork\u201d of services that police officers, firefighters and health care workers navigate.\n\nGrau Grau\n\nIU Health hopes to offer outlying hospitals a more certain service\u2014especially for their most fragile patients. Teri Grau, director of the IU Health LifeLine service, emphasized that IU Health\u2019s ambulance staff all go through extensive training and many have several years\u2019 experience treating patients in a hospital.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re able to open up the front door of Methodist Hospital and take that to wherever the patient is,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nA wide net\n\n\n\nReferrals from hospitals statewide are already key for IU Health to keep the operating rooms and patient wards full at its three downtown hospitals\u2014Methodist, University and Riley Hospital for Children.\n\n\n\nThose referrals have been beefed up considerably since the late 1990s as IU Health acquired 10 hospitals spread as far south as Paoli and as far north as LaPorte. IU Health also built three hospitals, in the Indianapolis suburbs of Avon, Carmel and Fishers.\n\n\n\nStarting in 2009, IU Health started employing more physicians directly. IU Health Physicians now has more than 1,500 doctors, who refer the vast majority of their patients to IU Health facilities.\n\n\n\nThose moves have boosted IU Health\u2019s patient revenue from $4 billion in 2010 to $5.6 billion in 2014.\n\n\n\nBut the number of patients checking into its downtown hospitals has been in decline, as technology has allowed more surgeries to be performed as outpatient procedures and as Obamacare has spurred health insurance plans to award bonus payments to hospitals that reduce hospitalizations.\n\n\n\nIU Health\u2019s downtown hospitals admitted 51,828 patients in 2014, down 11 percent from 2010. And they had declined another 2 percent during the first nine months of 2015, the most recent data available.\n\n\n\nBrenton, the IU Health executive, hopes the LifeLine expansion puts IU Health in a better position for what\u2019s coming next in health care, even if it\u2019s not clear yet what that is.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to gain a lot of intelligence by really being the clearinghouse for tens of thousands of transports a year,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re really excited about what that information\u2019s going to tell us.\u201d\n\n\n\nBrenton also acknowledged this move could cost some of IU Health\u2019s existing ambulance providers some business, most notably Louisville-based Care Ambulance. Mike Gilbert, the head of Care Ambulance, declined to comment for this story.\n\n\n\nThe volume of LifeLine\u2019s ambulance service has already exceeded expectations. IU Health executives expected to make four runs a day in December, and hoped to grow that number eventually to eight. But in the first three weeks, the service was doing nine runs per day.\n\n\n\nThat pace would exceed the 3,000 runs per year IU Health set as a goal, which would add to the 4,000 runs it already does via helicopter and mobile ICU.\n\n\n\nIU Health is pitching the LifeLine personnel as better trained and, in many instances, having higher qualifications than is standard for ambulance services. The LifeLine service now employs 225 people, up from 200 before the expansion.\n\n\n\n\u2018Dynamic\u2019 environment\n\n\n\nIts officials think the need for higher-level care is growing as many county-owned hospitals have scaled back services, such as OB/GYN care, or don\u2019t provide critical care. \u201cThe health care environment is really dynamic right now,\u201d said Grau, LifeLine director.\n\n\n\nFinancial challenges in the ambulance industry have forced some ambulance services out of business. The Arizona-based Rural/Metro ambulance service ceased operations in 30 Indiana communities last year.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been many private ambulances that have come and gone throughout the state of Indiana,\u201d Grau said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a lot of inconsistency result.\u201d\n\n\n\nRandy Seals, head of Seals Ambulance in Indianapolis, said Indiana\u2019s Medicaid payment rates have been stuck at the same level for more than 20 years. He noted that most privately insured patients have family support to handle their transportation needs. Seals sold itself in 2014 to Tennessee-based Priority Ambulance, but continues to operate fairly independently.\n\n\n\nAccording to a 2012 study published in the journal Academic Emergency Medicine, the portion of visits to hospital emergency rooms that arrive by ambulance is 16 percent for Medicaid patients, 13 percent for uninsured patients, and 11 percent for privately insured patients.\n\n\n\nAccording to the Indiana Department of Homeland Security, the number of EMS runs grew more than 23 percent from 2010 to 2014; population growth during that time was just 2 percent. EMS runs topped 197,000 last year, up from more than 160,000 in 2010.\n\n\n\nAnd the total number of ambulance transports is several times higher, because the majority of runs aren\u2019t for emergencies but are to transport very sick or weak patients between health care facilities safely.\n\n\n\nThe Indiana State Department of Health recorded nearly 450,000 ambulance runs during the first 11 months of 2015, even though 45 percent of active ambulance providers did not report any data. That was nearly 24 percent higher than during the first 11 months of 2014, although some of that increase was likely due to a higher number of ambulance services reporting data.\n\n\n\nSeals, the ambulance CEO, said his business in central Indiana has been growing as the number of hospitals and free-standing emergency rooms has risen over the past decade.\n\n\n\nIU Health\u2019s leaders also suspect transport will be a growing field\u2014particularly in the non-emergency areas.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe hope that, by becoming that clearinghouse for transport, we learn an awful lot,\u201d Brenton said, \u201cand to the extent that there are opportunities to provide better care, we could take advantage of that.\u201d\u2022", "article_metadata": {"description": "To draw patients to its downtown hospitals, Indiana University Health has used hospital acquisitions, physician employment and statewide advertising.
