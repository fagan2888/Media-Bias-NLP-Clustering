Rapid City, SD

A pre-kindergarten program in western South Dakota has proven to help children improve their language skills.



But despite the positive results, South Dakota officials say they won't fund a statewide effort.



The existing program in Rapid City is privately funded and only covers 60 low-income children. The program comes on top of the approximately 450 children covered by the federal Head Start Program.



The newspaper reports South Dakota is one of ten states that do not have any state-funded early childhood education efforts.



Tony Venhuizen is the spokesman for Gov. Dennis Daugaard. Venhuizen says the governor believes that it is a higher priority to fund current programs such as K-12 and higher education than to create a new initiative.
