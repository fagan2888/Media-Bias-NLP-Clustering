Previously, the company predicted income of $1.68 billion to $1.85 billion.\n\nBloomberg News DaVita company photo of kidney-dialysis centers.\n\nThe raised expectations were enough to encourage analysts. Matt Weight, analyst at Feltl and Company, said revenue growth in fourth-quarter earnings, reported late Tuesday, was better than he expected.\n\n\u201c[This year's] operating income guidance was increased on an improved dialysis outlook, and we suspect that will not be the last time,\u201d Feltl said in a note to clients. He added, though, that upcoming Medicare Advantage rate projections from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \u2014 due next week \u2014 could dampen share growth.\n\nMargaret Kaczor, analyst at William Blair, pointed out that volume continues to climb at a healthy clip. Growth in the number of patients using DaVita dialysis centers grew 5.2% during the quarter, higher than the 4.7% that was projected.\n\n\u201cThe 5.2% unacquired patient growth suggests that the underlying volume growth remains healthy and DaVita is modestly taking share in its current centers,\u201d Kaczor said in her note. \u201cThis is faster than organic patient growth for the domestic market of 4%.\u201d\n\nDaVita said fourth-quarter net income was $212.3 million, or 99 cents a share, 36% more than the $155.8 million, or 75 cents a share, for the same period a year ago, and ahead of estimates from analysts polled by Fact Set by a penny. Sales were $3.06 billion against last year\u2019s $2.48 billion, and narrowly beating forecasts of $3.04 billion.\n\nFollow Russ Britt on Twitter @russbrittmktw.\n\nFollow Health Exchange on Twitter @MWHealthBlog.\n\nMore health-care news from MarketWatch:\n\nWellCare tumbles on profit miss, expected Obamacare costs\n\nThe Onion gets planted in Land of Lincoln to promote Obamacare\n\nWalgreen\u2019s record move a mystery; talk centers on London meetings", "article_metadata": {"article.created": "2014-02-12T13:07:25-05:00", "application-name": "MarketWatch.com", "twitter": {"domain": "Marketwatch.com", "description": "A narrow victory on the earnings front, coupled with an increase in its own 2014 forecast, pushes shares of DaVita Inc. up to a new all-time high in midday trades Tuesday, making it the second-best performer on the S&P 500", "title": "DaVita shares hit a new high after company ups its 2014 forecast", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/02/12/davita-shares-hit-a-new-high-after-company-ups-its-2014-forecast/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BU488_davita_MG_20140212122834.jpg"}, "site": "MarketWatch", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.author": "Russ Britt", "article.section": "Markets", "keywords": "DaVita Inc.,dialysis,earnings", "article.headline": "DaVita shares hit a new high after company ups its 2014 forecast", "msapplication-task": "name=SmartMoney;action-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/;icon-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/favicon.ico", "news_keywords": "DaVita Inc.,dialysis,earnings", "author": "Russ Britt", "article.page": "Health Exchange Blog", "description": "A narrow victory on the earnings front, coupled with an increase in its own 2014 forecast, pushes shares of DaVita Inc. up to a new all-time high in midday trades Tuesday, making it the second-best performer on the S&P 500", "article.published": "2014-02-12T13:07:25-05:00", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "msapplication-tooltip": "MarketWatch", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/02/12/davita-shares-hit-a-new-high-after-company-ups-its-2014-forecast/", "app_id": 283204329838}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch", "image_count": 2}, "og": {"site_name": "Marketwatch", "description": "A narrow victory on the earnings front, coupled with an increase in its own 2014 forecast, pushes shares of DaVita Inc. up to a new all-time high in midday trades Tuesday, making it the second-best performer on the S&P 500", "title": "DaVita shares hit a new high after company ups its 2014 forecast", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/02/12/davita-shares-hit-a-new-high-after-company-ups-its-2014-forecast/", "image": {"width": 569, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BU488_davita_MG_20140212122834.jpg", "height": 398}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Health Exchange", "article.id": "BL-MW243B-2067", "article.updated": "2014-02-12T13:07:25-05:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccd81\"", "article_summary": "Growth in the number of patients using DaVita dialysis centers grew 5.2% during the quarter, higher than the 4.7% that was projected.\nBloomberg News DaVita company photo of kidney-dialysis centers.\nPreviously, the company predicted income of $1.68 billion to $1.85 billion.\nHe added, though, that upcoming Medicare Advantage rate projections from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \u2014 due next week \u2014 could dampen share growth.\nMatt Weight, analyst at Feltl and Company, said revenue growth in fourth-quarter earnings, reported late Tuesday, was better than he expected."}
