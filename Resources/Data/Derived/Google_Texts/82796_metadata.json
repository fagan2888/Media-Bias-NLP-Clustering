Most of Colorado\u2019s position players have already reported to spring training, although the first full-squad workout isn\u2019t scheduled until Thursday.\n\nThe Rockies also continue to say that don\u2019t know anything about a possible suspension under Major League Baseball\u2019s new domestic violence policy.\n\nHowever, a resolution appears to be getting closer.\n\nCommissioner Rob Manfred told reporters Friday in Florida that he expects to have a decision within a few days on two of the first three cases covered by the sport\u2019s new policy. MLB has been investigating cases involving New York Yankees closer Aroldis Chapman and Los Angeles Dodgers outfielder Yasiel Puig, as well as Reyes. Manfred did not specify which cases he hopes to decide soon.\n\nReyes \u2014 part of the trade last July that sent Troy Tulowitzki to Toronto \u2014 is alleged to have assaulted his wife on Halloween in a Hawaii hotel. He is scheduled to go on trial April 4, the same day of the Rockies\u2019 regular-season opener. That fact the Reyes still faces a criminal trial could play a part in Manfred\u2019s decision. Reyes, slated to earn $22 million this season, is the Rockies\u2019 highest-paid player.\n\nHowever, the new policy states that the commissioner can hand out discipline for \u201cjust cause,\u201d so Reyes\u2019 appearance in criminal court is not necessarily the deciding factor. In addition, Reyes could appeal any suspension to baseball\u2019s arbitrator.\n\n\u201cThe standards of proof in a labor arbitration and a criminal case are very different,\u201d Manfred told reporters during his first spring-training media availability.\n\n\u201cMy strong preference would have been to have them decided by this point in the calendar,\u201d Manfred continued. \u201cMore important than the calendar, however, is making sure that we know all the facts before I make a decision. The worst thing that can happen from our perspective is to make a decision and then find out that we decided without knowing everything that happened.\u201d\n\nChapman was acquired by the Yankees from the Cincinnati Reds in a December trade. Chapman is under investigation for an incident at his house in Florida in October involving his girlfriend. Chapman is alleged to have fired a gun during the incident.\n\nProsecutors declined to file charges and Chapman has said he would appeal any MLB suspension.\n\nPuig was involved in an argument with his sister at a Miami bar on Nov. 25. According to the Miami Police Department, Puig and a bouncer at the bar were involved in a fight after Puig was asked to leave following the argument with his sister.\n\nManfred said there are reasons why his decisions are taking so long.\n\n\u201cThe timing of gathering those facts is not completely within our control,\u201d Manfred said. \u201cObviously, in large measure we\u2019re dependent on law enforcement and the activities surrounding the three incidents. I expect that we will have some action on at least two of the three in the next few days.\u201d\n\nUnder MLB\u2019s domestic violence policy, discipline is not contingent on a criminal conviction.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s lots of reasons for non-prosecution,\u201d Manfred said. \u201cNot all of them relate to the underlying facts. It may be unavailability or unwillingness of witnesses to participate, whatever. That makes the cases difficult.\n\n\u201cSecondly, the policy is pretty explicit. The fact that law enforcement decides that it either is not going to \u2014 or cannot, because of a lack of proof \u2014 proceed doesn\u2019t mean that discipline is not appropriate. The policy is very explicit about that.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "On the Rox", "description": "Baseball commissioner Rob Manfred told reporters Friday  in Florida that he expects to have a decision within a few days on two of the first three cases covered by the sport's new domestic violence policy.
