Cost savings could run as high as $6.1 million for the Minnesota Department of Corrections, which operates the state\u2019s prisons, and $5.5 million for the state\u2019s counties, which pay for the jails.\n\nCounties and the state will continue to foot the bill for medical care provided inside the detention facilities, which makes up the majority of the health care budgets.\n\nThe potential $11 million savings is \u201conly a sliver of the cost, but a few slivers add up to real money,\u201d said Julie Ring, executive director of the Association of Minnesota Counties, which pushed for the change. Care for the state\u2019s incarcerated populations is becoming increasingly expensive, she said, as they come in with more serious health issues.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like \u2018Oh, I have a head cold,\u2019 \u201d Ring said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about people in county jails who have dialysis, cancer, and other difficult and expensive medical regimens. The cost of health care in county jails has really skyrocketed.\u201d\n\nJames Franklin, executive director of the Minnesota Sheriffs\u2019 Association, said that having more adults with health care coverage \u2014 both in and out of custody \u2014 could improve more than the bottom line.\n\n\u201cOur customers often have medical problems that can cause them to be a criminal or the victim of a crime that in some way causes them to come into the law enforcement custody system again, and it\u2019s a spiraling problem,\u201d Franklin said. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping this change will keep them in health care and out of our system.\u201d\n\nMore eligibility, bigger percentage matches\n\nWhen Medicaid was created in 1965, inmates were not eligible, leaving the states and counties on the hook for their hospitalizations and other inpatient care. That law went onto the books in Minnesota.\n\nIn 1997, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services allowed inmates who needed hospitalization to become eligible for Medicaid if they otherwise qualified. Minnesota, however, did not automatically change its law, because eligibility would have to apply to both state prisoners and county jail inmates. As a result, Ring said, the Department of Corrections would have saved money, but the Department of Human Services would have had to pay the matching Medicaid dollars.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act not only expanded Medicaid eligibility, but increased the reimbursement rate from 50 percent to 100 percent. Financial projections say 67 percent of Minnesota inmates would be eligible for a 100 percent match, while another 33 percent would qualify for a 50 percent match.\n\n\u201cAny money that comes to us from a different source is free money,\u201d said Rep. Jim Abeler, R-Anoka, who co-sponsored the bipartisan House bill. \u201cFederal money coming to us is free money.\u201d\n\nAnother sponsor of the bill, Rep. Diane Loeffler, DFL-Minneapolis, said it\u2019s a step toward cost savings. The growing demands of health care for inmates should be shared with the federal government, she said, particularly in light of inmates\u2019 disproportionately high rate of addiction and mental health disorders.\n\nHennepin County Sheriff Rich Stanek, who oversees the state\u2019s largest jail and its 38,000 inmates per year, said the jail\u2019s health care costs rose by $800,000 in 2013. About half of his inmates have no insurance of any kind. Nearly a third suffer from mental illness.\n\n\u201cI think it will be several months before we figure out what difference it\u2019s going to make overall,\u201d Stanek said. \u201cBut so many people get turned away from the front doors of the jail to begin with that we have to send them right over to the hospital to be stitched up. Every night is another half-dozen or so that we can\u2019t care for within the facility.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "&nbsp;.", "title": "Next year, feds will pick up the tab for Minnesota inmate hospitalizations", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/next-year-feds-will-pick-up-the-tab-for-minnesota-inmate-hospitalizations/235827551/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/1jail.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/1jail.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "twitter": {"description": "&nbsp;.", "title": "Next year, feds will pick up the tab for Minnesota inmate hospitalizations", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/next-year-feds-will-pick-up-the-tab-for-minnesota-inmate-hospitalizations/235827551/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/1jail.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/1jail.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "description": "&nbsp;."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe17d5\"", "article_summary": "A Minnesota law set to take effect next month means the federal government will pick up the tab on hospital visits by some inmates of Minnesota jails and prisons, a move that could save the state millions.\nCounties and the state will continue to foot the bill for medical care provided inside the detention facilities, which makes up the majority of the health care budgets.\nFinancial projections say 67 percent of Minnesota inmates would be eligible for a 100 percent match, while another 33 percent would qualify for a 50 percent match.\nIt\u2019s the first in-state change in decades to a long-standing rule that deems inmates ineligible for Medicaid, known in Minnesota as Medical Assistance.\nMinnesota, however, did not automatically change its law, because eligibility would have to apply to both state prisoners and county jail inmates."}
