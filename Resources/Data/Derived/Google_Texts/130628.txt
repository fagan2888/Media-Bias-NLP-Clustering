BOSTON (AP) â€” Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has derided The Boston Globe as "stupid" and "worthless" in response to a satirical front page printed by the newspaper Sunday that lampoons a potential Trump presidency.

The fake front page is dated April 9, 2017, and its main story is about Trump calling for deportations. Another article mentions work being halted on a wall at the Mexico border. There's also a short item about backlash Trump received after tweeting a photo of his new dog he named "Madame Peng," after China's first lady Peng Liyuan (puhng LEE'-yoo-en).

In an editorial (http://bit.ly/20qYqoH ), the Globe calls the satire "an exercise in taking a man at his word."

Speaking on the campaign trail in Rochester, New York, Sunday, Trump called it a "totally dishonest story."
