With 2016 election season underway, Beltway insider blog FamousDC has launched a database of Washington’s most influential digital strategists.

Although its name is short for “Best of FamousDC,” it also doubles as a tongue-in-cheek praise to those who made the list as individuals who are a big freaking deal.

ADVERTISEMENT “The big hires in campaigns used to be the campaign manager and the fundraiser. Today, more and more campaigns are putting a digital strategist at the leadership table,” Amos Snead, a partner at Bryant Row and co-founder of FamousDC, told The Hill. “We decided to use the FamousDC platform to monitor these digital experts as the 2016 presidential campaigns hire up."

The crew that helped put the whole thing together — NJI Media, FamousDC, public affairs firm Bryant Row and media analytics company Resonate — partnered with The Washington Examiner, Beam Suntory and 1776 on Thursday night to celebrate the website’s unveiling.

“In this room are the smartest digital minds in politics today and we know that you’re all going to be busy from now to Election Day,” Snead said on Thursday , “So, we appreciate you spending some time with us.”

Held at 1776’s office space in downtown D.C., the party was attended by all sectors of the Washington machine — including Neil Chatterjee, a senior policy adviser to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Mitch McConnellRyan seeks to put stamp on GOP in Trump era Trump and Ryan to speak by phone Bill would require nominees to release tax returns MORE (R-Ky.); Nika Nour, from the Internet Association; Archie Smart, an executive vice president at Qorvis; Morgan Gress from 1776; Jonathan Nabavi, counsel at the Senate Judiciary Committee; Mindy Finn, who does digital strategy at the Republican National Committee; Phil Herndon, the director of strategy at NJI Media; Mark Bryant of Resonate, the International Franchise Association’s Matt Haller and SIFMA’s Carol Danko.
