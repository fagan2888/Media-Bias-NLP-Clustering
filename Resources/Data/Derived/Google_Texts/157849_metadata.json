It would be easier for them to determine how much they owe and how to pay it.\u201d\n\nBut while Koskinen seemed to agree with Hatch about the need to simplify people\u2019s taxes, he didn\u2019t take Hatch\u2019s larger point about reducing the scope of the IRS\u2019s responsibilities. Hatch said the reach of the IRS is expanding, and noted its new responsibility for enforcing Obamacare taxes.\n\nHatch said that vast expansion of authority is why the IRS has been asking for more funding each year. \u201cIt isn\u2019t the IRS\u2019s budget, it\u2019s an ever-growing set of tax laws, an ever-increasing number of federal programs the IRS is charged with administrating,\u201d Hatch said.\n\nBut Koskinen didn\u2019t go that far, and instead reiterated the need for much more funding at the IRS so the agency can do its job and help provide support for taxpayers. The current IRS budget is $10.9 billion for the current fiscal year, and Koskinen noted that the Obama administration has asked for $12.9 billion for the next year, a $2 billion bump.\n\n\u201cThe level of funding would provide substantial support for our mission, and help the agency move ahead in a number of critical areas,\u201d Koskinen said.\n\nThe IRS notoriously spent millions of dollars several years ago to upgrade its computers, but Koskinen said one way they would use more money is to do more upgrades.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re running applications that were running when John F. Kennedy was president,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s how antiquated the system is.\u201d\n\nKoskinen added in his testimony that the IRS is using COBOL programming language. \u201cCOBOL was considered outdated back when I served as chairman of the President\u2019s Council on Year 2000 Conversion and it is extremely difficult to find IT experts who are versed in this language,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "IRS Commissioner John Koskinen on Tuesday admitted that the tax code is too complicated, and that it should be simplified.  \"You are correct, the tax code has gotten to be extremely unwieldy,\" Koskinen told the Senate Finance Committee.
