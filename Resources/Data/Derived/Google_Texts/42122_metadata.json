The twins and their mother have a disease which makes their bones extremely fragile called osteogensis imperfecta while Ken has cerebral palsy.\n\nThe family says that they\u2019ll be paying nearly $8,000 more per year for medical care after being denied coverage through Obamcare, The Bay City Times reported. The parents receive their income from Social Security disability payments and also have health insurance through Medicare.\n\nHowever, the Medicare plan does not cover their children who were covered by a private Blue Cross plan until recently being canceled. The Michigan Department of Community Health\u2019s Children\u2019s Special Health Care Services covers them through a supplemental plan that only assists in matters concerning their bone disease.\n\n\u201cWe received a letter from Blue Cross maybe four months ago stating that their plan was going to be canceled due to new requirements of Obamacare,\u201d Missy Davert told The Bay City Times, adding that the letter did not state what about the Affordable Care Act requirements necessitated her children be dropped from their plan. \u201cI can imagine they didn\u2019t fit criteria of the new plan. There were some particular benefits the new act didn\u2019t cover.\u201d\n\nThe Daverts applied to the federal government\u2019s healthcare plan but claim their first application was lost and their second application was denied. They are waiting for a response to a written appeal they filed in mid January. The response could take up to 90 days.\n\n\u201cWhat we did in the meantime, because their insurance was ending Dec. 31, we had to go out and buy a separate plan directly through Blue Cross/Blue Shield,\u201d Melissa Davert explained. \u201cThe president had come on TV and said, \u2018If you like your plan, you can keep your plan, we won\u2019t require you to get marketplace insurance for another year.\u2019 But Blue Cross/Blue Shield would not continue their plan, despite what the president said.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime the family has purchased a Blue Cross Gold Plan for their children. The out-of-pocket expenses with the new plan are a huge concern for the Daverts.\n\n\u201cThe premiums aren\u2019t an issue for us,\u201d Melissa Davert said. \u201cThe premiums under both plans are essentially the same. What could be costly for us are the out-of-pocket expenses. In our old plan, the most we would pay was $2,500 combined out-of-pocket per year. With the very best plan we could get them under Blue Cross, we have a $5,100 out-of-pocket maximum for each child for a total of $10,200.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the big issue,\u201d Ken Davert added.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s an incredible amount to absorb,\u201d Melissa Davert continued. \u201cThe only other plan that had a lower out of pocket maximum was a plan that\u2019s not accepted by their doctors. We would have ended up paying tens of thousands of dollars out of pocket if we would have got that.\u201d\n\nThe family has contacted the offices of U.S. Sens. Debbie Stabenow and Carl Levin along with U.S. Rep. Dan Kildee in hopes to receive some assistance from their elected officials. Mitch Rivard, a spokesman for Kildee, explained that his office is working with the family.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s been working directly with one of our case workers in our Flint office regarding her health insurance being canceled by Blue Cross/Blue Shield,\u201d Rivard said, adding that staff members have been working to help her enroll her children in a new plan.\n\nRivard said the congressman will meet directly with Melissa Davert sometime next week in a private meeting.\n\nThe mother of two said that her family is not eligible for Medicaid due to them coming from a working background, but she tried to re-apply for Obamacare Jan. 15. She received an \u201cerror\u201d message and no coverage. She just wants to share her story with other Americans about the high costs of insurance coverage.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re coming forward to educate the community, that if these kinds of costs can be imposed on our family, it can be imposed on any family,\u201d Melissa Davert said. \u201cA word of caution is to take notice and if they do think the system is unfair, to speak out.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating to me. It seems more and more our government has become a controlling power when the power is supposed to be with the people. I\u2019m not saying this law isn\u2019t good for some people. I\u2019m really happy for those people (being helped), and I\u2019m not trying to take away what they\u2019ve gained, but it\u2019s also hurting many people.\u201d\n\nHer husband, who is equally as frustrated, noted that they first trusted the president when he first presented Obamacare to the country.\n\n\u201cWe knew this was coming, but we trusted the president when he said, \u2018If you like it, you can keep it,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t the case. We liked our plan, we weren\u2019t planning on changing it, but we were forced to.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A family of four, whom all have disabilities, claims they were denied insurance with the Affordable Care Act and will will have to shell out thousands of dollars for medial care.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://washington.cbslocal.com/2014/01/23/family-with-disabilities-claims-they-were-denied-obamacare-coverage/", "image": {"width": 1500, "secure_url": "https://cbswashington.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/182585871-e1386069899710.jpg?w=1500", "identifier": "https://cbswashington.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/182585871-e1386069899710.jpg?w=1500", "height": 844}, "type": "article", "description": "A family of four, whom all have disabilities, claims they were denied insurance with the Affordable Care Act and will will have to shell out thousands of dollars for medial care.", "title": "Family With Disabilities Claims They Were Denied Obamacare Coverage"}, "twitter": {"site": "/cbsdc", "image": "https://cbswashington.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/182585871-e1386069899710.jpg?w=1500", "description": "A family of four, whom all have disabilities, claims they were denied insurance with the Affordable Care Act and will will have to shell out thousands of dollars for medial care.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Family With Disabilities Claims They Were Denied Obamacare Coverage"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "News, Sports, Weather, Traffic and the Best of Washington DC", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CBS DC", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cbsdc", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/cbsdc"}, "keywords": "affordable care act, politics, affordable care act, davert family, obamacare, president barack obama", "google-site-verification": "44caXBf4kjHeKKAT7ZZ89NaCX25utL_yRSa-qGpwIhY", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://washington.cbslocal.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/b87f6ea5e510fe3d34ffe9a8dbe8c1cf?s=16", "news_keywords": "affordable care act, davert family, obamacare, president barack obama"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc9ab\"", "article_summary": "However, the Medicare plan does not cover their children who were covered by a private Blue Cross plan until recently being canceled.\n\u201cWe\u2019re coming forward to educate the community, that if these kinds of costs can be imposed on our family, it can be imposed on any family,\u201d Melissa Davert said.\nKen and Melissa Davert along with their 15-year-old twins Austin and Michaela all suffer from disabilities.\nRivard said the congressman will meet directly with Melissa Davert sometime next week in a private meeting.\n\u201cThe premiums aren\u2019t an issue for us,\u201d Melissa Davert said."}
