There\u2019s a reason Rand Paul has become completely irrelevant.\n\nThe fact that Rand Paul was once touted as the savior of the Republican Party does not speak well of either of them. But just to drive the point home that Paul is definitely not suited to play the role of level-headed grownup in the room, the Kentucky libertarian got a little hysterical this week about Bernie Sanders.\n\nJust a tad.\n\nThe word \u201csocialist\u201d can do that to right-wing libertarian types, sending them into paroxysms of wild-eyed terror. On a conservative South Carolina radio show, Paul suggested that a Bernie Sanders presidency might set off \u201cmass genocide.\u201d In his view, that\u2019s what happens when you try socialism. Apparently, he has never heard of Scandinavia, where genocide really hasn\u2019t been a thing.\n\n\u201cIt amazes me and it actually kind of scares me,\u201d Paul told radio host Vince Coakley. \u201cI think it\u2019s not an accident of history that most of the times when socialism has been tried that attendant with that has been mass genocide of people or any of those who object to it. Stalin killed tens of millions of people. Mao killed tens of millions of people. Pol Pot killed tens of millions of people.\u201d\n\nGranted, Paul is not the only Republican who is confused about Sanders\u2019 use of the word socialism, and certainly not the only one using ridiculous rhetoric to scare people to death. Texas state Rep. Jason Villalba compared Sanders to Hitler on Tuesday, later backing off, and going the other way to Stalin.\n\nSo clearly, we can expect a lot more of this nonsense.\n\n2. Trump tries to have it both ways with healthcare.\n\nRepublican frontrunner Donald Trump (yes, still) is working on a healthcare plan to replace Obamacare and it\u2019s the most beautiful, wonderful healthcare plan ever, because it is Donald Trump\u2019s. It just is. Believe him. It\u2019s a \u201cgreat plan.\u201d He was discussing this proposal in his usual vague, word-salady way this week with talk radio host Simon Conway, saying he would cut \u201cgreat deals\u201d with healthcare providers, because that is what he does. He cuts great deals.\n\nThe Donald, as the great president he so clearly is going to be, would cut such great deals that everyone would want to choose private insurance. And the rest would go to hospitals \u201cbecause you make a deal with these hospitals so that they can\u2019t rip off the country.\u201d\n\nSo, that\u2019s his fix. And by the way, this universal healthcare system is in no way socialism, \u201cit\u2019s just not,\u201d he said, because he, the Great One, does not \u201cput a label on it.\u201d\n\nThere, fixed.\n\n3. Huckabee. Just. Does. Not. Get. It. At. All.\n\nMr. Guns, Grits and Gravy hides a mighty racism behind that folksy style, but it sneaks out from time to time. Mike Huckabee won the award for most offensive, out-of-touch, clueless tweet during this week\u2019s Democratic debate, hands down, when he said to his followers: \u201cI trust @BernieSanders with my tax dollars like I trust A North Korean chef with my labrador!\u201d #DemDebate\n\nOh, hahahahahahaha. The Huckster. Such a colorful way with words.\n\nThe backlash confused Huckabee. Or really, it did not confuse him, because absolutely nothing, no new information and certainly none of \u2018dem newfangled, politically correct ideas, like it\u2019s not such a good idea to repeat tired racist stereotypes, penetrate his skull.", "article_metadata": {"description": "An appearance on \"The View\" goes as badly as expected, while Rand Paul lashes out against his own irrelevancy", "title": "5 worst right-wing moments of the week \u2014 Ann Coulter gets humbled on national television", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "An appearance on \"The View\" goes as badly as expected, while Rand Paul lashes out against his own irrelevancy", "title": "5 worst right-wing moments of the week \u2014 Ann Coulter gets humbled on national television", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/10/19/5_worst_right_wing_moments_of_the_week_ann_coulter_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/10/ann-coulter-the-view.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "An appearance on \"The View\" goes as badly as expected, while Rand Paul lashes out against his own irrelevancy", "title": "5 worst right-wing moments of the week \u2014 Ann Coulter gets humbled on national television", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/10/ann-coulter-the-view.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Janet Allon", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, AlterNet, Ann Coulter, Donald Trump, Mike Huckabee, Rand Paul", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: AlterNet, Ann Coulter, Donald Trump, Mike Huckabee, Rand Paul, Politics NewsThis article originally appeared on AlterNet1.\nRepublican frontrunner Donald Trump (yes, still) is working on a healthcare plan to replace Obamacare and it\u2019s the most beautiful, wonderful healthcare plan ever, because it is Donald Trump\u2019s.\nThe word \u201csocialist\u201d can do that to right-wing libertarian types, sending them into paroxysms of wild-eyed terror.\nThe fact that Rand Paul was once touted as the savior of the Republican Party does not speak well of either of them.\nTexas state Rep.
