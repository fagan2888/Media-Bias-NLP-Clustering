Often, they\u2019re uninsured because parents don\u2019t know they qualify for help or how to apply.\n\nWhen researchers randomly paired some parents with peer mentors to help with applications, however, far more kids got covered than when parents were left to grapple with enrollment on their own. Once they got benefits, the parents with peer mentors also had fewer problems getting care for their kids.\n\n\u201cThe parent mentor intervention is interactive, provides social support, connects parents of uninsured children with other parents who successfully insured their own children and come from the same neighborhoods and similar racial/ethnic backgrounds, and includes parent mentor training on providing assistance with pediatric care,\u201d said lead study author Glenn Flores, a health policy specialist at Medica Research Institute in Minneapolis, Minnesota.\n\nAbsent this help, parents got information on Medicaid and CHIP from advertising on radio, television, the Internet and public transit as well as outreach at community centers and daycare facilities.\n\n\u201cIt appears that traditional Medicaid/CHIP outreach and enrollment are less effective because they employ largely passive mechanisms,\u201d Flores added by email.\n\nIn a small experiment pitting peer mentors against traditional outreach methods, Flores and colleagues followed 237 parents for one year to see how many got their children enrolled in Medicaid or CHIP. Roughly half of the parents got mentors.\n\nBy the end of the study, 95 percent of mentored parents got coverage for their kids, compared with 68 percent of the parents who didn\u2019t receive this assistance, researchers report in the journal Pediatrics.\n\nHalf of the parents with mentors got their kids coverage within about two months, compared with more than four months without mentoring.\n\nJust 15 percent of children in mentored households lacked primary care providers, compared with 39 percent of the other kids.\n\nFor specialist care, just 11 percent of kids in the mentor group had trouble seeing doctors, compared with 46 percent of the other children.\n\nParents also reported more satisfaction with coverage and were more likely to renew benefits when they had mentors to guide them along the way.\n\nTwo years after mentoring stopped, all of the kids enrolled with this help were still insured, compared with 76 percent of children whose parents navigated the system on their own.\n\nFor each child covered, mentors cost about $53 a month. But researchers calculated that mentors saved roughly $6,045 a year in avoided costs from hospitalizations, intensive care, emergency department visits and lost wages for parents who missed work to tend to their kids.\n\nThe experiment was conducted in urban populations of Hispanic and black people in Texas, and the findings might not be the same elsewhere, the authors note. It\u2019s also possible that the contact researchers had with parents not receiving mentors inflated enrollment in this group which otherwise might have been even less likely to get benefits outside of the study.\n\nAnother limitation of the study is its reliance on parents to report what care children received. Because this wasn\u2019t verified by medical records, it\u2019s possible faulty recollections could have influenced the results.\n\nStill, the results suggest mentors may be one way insure more kids, said Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, a researcher at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore who wasn\u2019t involved in the study.\n\n\u201cSigning up for insurance requires trust, and this paper shows that parent mentors can connect to others to help them understand the value of insurance and enroll,\u201d Sharfstein said by email.\n\nMentors also worked because they were just a call or text away anytime questions cropped up, noted Dr. Michael Weitzman, a pediatrics researcher at New York University School of Medicine who wasn\u2019t involved in the study.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like having a friend who\u2019s just really good at insurance stuff and wants to help,\u201d Weitzman said by email.\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/22nBhII Pediatrics, online March 17, 2016.", "article_metadata": {"DCSext.ContentID_healthNews": "USKCN0WJ2ER", "sailthru.author": "Lisa Rapaport", "Author": "Lisa Rapaport", "DCSext.PageNumber": 1, "twitter": {"description": "(Reuters Health) -
