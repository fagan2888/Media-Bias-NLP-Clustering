Bill Haslam announced Tuesday morning.\n\n\u201cThese are the types of jobs we are looking for,\u201d said Brian Hercules, vice president of economic development, Rutherford County Chamber of Commerce.\n\nThe $2.9 million investment from Empyrean Benefit Solutions Inc. in a new customer service center in La Vergne plays perfectly into the Chamber and Destination Rutherford\u2019s white-collar job recruitment strategy, Hercules said.\n\n\u201cRutherford County is beginning to be seen as an opportunity by white-collar firms,\u201d Hercules said, listing M-TEK and Schwan Cosmetics as recent wins for the county\u2019s economy.\n\nEmpyrean chose La Vergne for this new facility because of its infrastructure, strength in medicine, education and attractive culture and lifestyle, said Richard Wolfe, Empyrean\u2019s co-founder and CEO.\n\n\u201cThe expansion allows Empyrean to provide services across multiple delivery centers and access talent to support demand for Empyrean\u2019s technology and capabilities to manage health and benefits programs and the compliance requirements associated with ACA (Affordable Care Act) for employers, brokers, consultants and carriers,\u201d he said.\n\nThe La Vergne facility is Empyrean\u2019s secondary customer service center and will be used to serve new health care markets.\n\nDestination Rutherford Chairman Bill Jones said he wasn\u2019t surprised when the Houston-based benefits engagement technology and service company chose to locate the new jobs in La Vergne.\n\n\u201cWe are thrilled to welcome this innovative company and congratulate them on their decision to add 120 jobs to our community,\u201d Jones said.\n\nNo tax incentives were offered from the county to secure the new jobs, Hercules said.\n\n\u201cIt means a great deal when a company chooses to start new operations in our state, and we look forward to building a strong partnership with Empyrean in the years ahead as we strive to make Tennessee the No. 1 location in the Southeast for high-quality jobs,\u201d Haslam said.\n\nThe company created a client-adaptive technology platform to increase customer efficiency and reduce administrative costs. Empyrean is unique among leading benefit administration providers in assigning dedicated service teams to its clients.\n\nThe dedicated service model, which provides continuity from day one of the client relationship throughout its lifetime, fosters a close and enduring partnership and builds a deeper understanding of each client\u2019s business objectives, plan design and operational processes.\n\nReach Michelle Willard at 615-278-5164, on Twitter @MichWillard or Rutherford County Business News on Facebook at facebook.com/DNJBusiness.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.dnj.com/1TIBrTo", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Health care industry support company required no county tax incentives", "og": {"site_name": "DNJ", "description": "Health care industry support company required no county tax incentives", "title": "La Vergne lands 120 white-collar jobs", "url": "http://www.dnj.com/story/money/business/2016/05/03/customer-service-center-creates-120-jobs-la-vergne/83867412/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/dnj.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Health care industry support company required no county tax incentives", "title": "La Vergne lands 120 white-collar jobs", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0d61e6903d1ba8f0cc73a0d796a9737c39b98d13/c=460-0-1641-1181&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/05/27/Murfreesboro/B9317508778Z.1_20150527173422_000_GJ1ATMEOQ.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@dnj_com", "site": "@dnj_com", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=894078678", "fb": {"app_id": 184474251565027}, "article": {"author": "http://www.facebook.com/DNJBusiness"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "La Vergne, Empyrean Benefit Solutions,  Rutherford County, News, jobs, Brian Hercules, Bill Jones, Bill Haslam"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1ac1\"", "article_summary": "Buy Photo Brian Hercules (Photo: HELEN COMER/DNJ)Buy PhotoLA VERGNE \u2014 A Texas-based company will bring 120 white-collar jobs to Rutherford County, Tennessee Gov.\nThe La Vergne facility is Empyrean\u2019s secondary customer service center and will be used to serve new health care markets.\nDestination Rutherford Chairman Bill Jones said he wasn\u2019t surprised when the Houston-based benefits engagement technology and service company chose to locate the new jobs in La Vergne.\nReach Michelle Willard at 615-278-5164, on Twitter @MichWillard or Rutherford County Business News on Facebook at facebook.com/DNJBusiness.\nEmpyrean chose La Vergne for this new facility because of its infrastructure, strength in medicine, education and attractive culture and lifestyle, said Richard Wolfe, Empyrean\u2019s co-founder and CEO."}
