And they're calling Gov. Nathan Deal, who is trying to woo them this election year with promised raises.\n\nBut many teachers tell me any raise will be wiped out by furlough days and increased health costs.\n\nI asked Tim Callahan of the Professional Association of Georgia Educators for his take on what has happened and why:\n\nHe wrote:\n\nThe State Health Benefit Plan is run by the Dept. of Community Health (DCH) which is an executive not a legislative agency. The governor appoints the DCH board which in turn names the executive director. Thus the governor holds a tight rein on SHBP. (Though Gov. Deal is trying hard to distance himself from the controversy, his staff directing everyone to DCH. If he has a health policy advisor, which he most certainly does, they seem to be missing in action.)\n\nThey re-bid the multi-billion dollar contract every several years (by law) and the way the last vendor United Health Care (UHC) won the contract several years back was that their low bid entailed \"jawboning\" providers around the state. There were several months of furor back then because many providers didn't want to accept UHC reimbursement rates. Both parties, UHC and providers were at loggerheads for a few months and used the state employees caught in the middle as bargaining chips. Over time bargains were struck and the range of providers around the state broadened and the insured got used to the services of UHC.\n\n\n\nIt appears that the way Blue Cross Blue Shield got the current contract was to reduce costs by narrowing the range of options available to state employees. So to the usual transition problems that limited choice aspect seems to be exacerbating the worries out there. Add the fact that the folks at DCH haven't done - in my opinion - a very good job of either explaining the rationale behind the decision making/bid award process or providing clear information to stakeholders as to the details of the new coverage and you've got a lot of very upset folks around the state - justifiably so.\n\n\n\nTo the mix, you can also include the fact that UHC has hired some very pricy and very aggressive lobbyists to keep the pot boiling. We have spoken out to the agency, to the media and to policymakers trying to advocate for our members and to amplify grassroots voices such as TRAGIC's. Our staff attorneys are helping with individual cases.\n\n\n\nTo address the issues in a comprehensive way, some years back, and subsequent to the UHC transition problems, we sponsored a package of bills that we thought would address the problem. They would have:\n\n\n\n1. Made DCH a legislative rather than executive agency, more accountable to stakeholders\n\n2. Placed state employees on the DCH board of directors to participate in policy and budgetary decision making on the health plan covering them and their families\n\n3. Created a legislative study commission to tour the state, hold hearings and get feedback from the 650,000 state employees who are covered - actually hearing and learning from the insured population\n\n\n\nOur bills did not move then, but we are working again, seeking sponsors in the current legislative session. It seems that the governor and the DCH are looking at this solely as a budget issue, a numbers game. The human element involved seems to be missing from their calculations.\n\nHere is an excerpt from a detailed AJC story by AJC reporters James Salzer and Misty Williams explaining the history and the politics. I am running a longer-than-usual excerpt because this issue is multi-layered:\n\nBy James Salzer and Misty Williams\n\nThousands of Georgia teachers and state employees have come down with a serious case of sticker shock from their new health care plans since the start of the year. To save big money, the state decided to go with a single company to manage the health care of 650,000 teachers, state employees, retirees and their dependents. Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Georgia took over the $3 billion program Jan. 1.\n\nSince the switch, which is not related to the Affordable Care Act, state officials have gotten an earful from teachers and employees who are suddenly having to pay more for the same services they received under the old plan. They're complaining about higher deductibles, new networks that don't always include their old doctors and the elimination of copayments, which means they have to pay more upfront --- sometimes a lot more --- when they or their families seek treatment.\n\nFor Ashley Cline, whose husband is a high school science teacher in Cherokee County, the change means paying five times more for occupational therapy sessions for her 4-year-old daughter, who is developmentally delayed.\n\nUnder the old plan, Cline paid $25 --- her copay --- for each one-hour session. Now, she must pay $130 per session. The couple also has to pay a $2,000-per-person deductible before the insurance kicks in, and their monthly premium is about $80 more, too. \"We have to weigh the health and well-being of our kids against our pocketbook, \" she said. And that's \"while we're paying for insurance. It's disgusting.\"\n\nUpset and frustrated by the changes, Cline on Jan. 2 launched a Facebook page for Georgia teachers to share their experiences and advice about the new plans. The site --- Teachers Rally Against Georgia Insurance Changes, or TRAGIC --- attracted more than 5,200 members in the first week.\n\nState Sen. Brandon Beach, R-Alpharetta, who represents Cherokee County, said he understands why teachers, state employees and their families are upset. \"They haven't had a raise in four or five years, and now they are having more money taken out of their check and paying more out of their pocket,\" Beach said.\n\nState officials said the government can no longer afford a State Health Benefit Plan that was running deficits of hundreds of millions of dollars in recent years, particularly at a time when all other agencies were cutting back. The new deal with Blue Cross is expected to save $200 million this year.\n\n\"Making sure our members get the coverage they need is always our main focus,\u201d said Lisa Marie Shekell, communications director for the Georgia Department of Community Health. \"Quite frankly, with the deficits, we couldn't sustain (the old) system.\"\n\nBut DCH's handling of the lucrative health care contract has been a headache for the state since last summer. UnitedHealthcare, one of the two companies that held the main contract until Jan. 1, protested DCH's decision to go with Blue Cross, arguing that the agency had engaged in \"state-sponsored bid-rigging.\" United also argued, as did doctor and teacher groups, that the state's decision to go with only one health insurance company all but guaranteed that employees would pay more and doctors would receive less.\n\nUnitedHealthcare and CVS Caremark, which lost the plan's pharmacy business as of Jan. 1, have sued the state, hoping to persuade the courts to throw out the contracts and force the state to rebid the business.\n\nGov. Nathan Deal said Friday he thinks the losing bidders are ginning up criticism of the plan. \"The party that lost the bid ... has attempted to generate this kind of uproar,\" the governor said. \"I think that's the genesis of it and in some cases people have been given false information. If there's a problem, we will address it. But at this point in time many people aren't aware of the details.\"\n\nExactly how the new plan will save money is what has caused consternation. A DCH memo last year said savings would come from reducing payments to doctors and other health care providers. The state would also save by having teachers and employees, who have seen their insurance premiums jump in recent years, pay more.\n\nThe biggest change for many is the elimination of copays. The state has typically offered plans that included a standard fixed amount, called a copay, that a patient pays when they go to the doctor. So if a doctor's visit cost $150, for instance, the patient might pay $35 out-of-pocket.\n\nNone of the three versions of the Blue Cross plan --- bronze, silver or gold --- offers a copay. Instead, patients must pay the full cost of care, say $150 for that doctor's visit, until their deductible is reached. The insurer then begins to pay a certain percentage of the cost.\n\nBut to rein in costs, employers across the country are increasingly moving toward similar health plans with high deductibles and no copays, said Tony Holmes, a partner in the Atlanta office of global consulting firm Mercer.\n\nThey're trying to get people engaged in their own care, to understand the cost of treatment, Holmes said.\"There are people who run to the doctor for the sniffles if they have a $20 copay,\" he said. They might be less inclined to do that if a $100 fee replaces that copay. \"It's getting people to learn the cost of the care,\" Holmes said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "None", "og": {"url": "http://www.ajc.com/weblogs/get-schooled/2014/jan/16/slashing-health-benefits-georgia-teachers-tragic-o/", "image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2014/01/16/57/d6/teacherhiding.JPG", "type": "article", "description": "I receive daily emails from teachers around the state about changes to their health plan that are wreaking havoc on their medical care and their finances.", "title": "Slashing health benefits for Georgia teachers: Tragedy or new..."}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "ajc", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.ajc.com/weblogs/get-schooled/2014/jan/16/slashing-health-benefits-georgia-teachers-tragic-o/"}, "cmg_revpath": "/re/302/88119/weblogs/get-schooled/2014/jan/16/slashing-health-benefits-georgia-teachers-tragic-o/", "keywords": "get schooled blog", "viewport": "width=1024"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0912\"", "article_summary": "State Sen.
