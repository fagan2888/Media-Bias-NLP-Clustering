This is the kind of reality we\u2019re living in\u2026and we\u2019ll do whatever is necessary to put an end to it.\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s interview with Schieffer took place hours after Israeli commandos raided several sites in Gaza, engaging in a firefight with Hamas members and destroying some of the launchers that have been used to fire hundreds of rockets into Israel over the past few days.\n\nThe overnight raid was the first ground incursion by Israel into the Gaza Strip during this most recent conflict, but it was not Israel\u2019s only defensive action. Over the past several days, the Israeli military has conducted some 1,300 airstrikes in the densely populated Palestinian area, killing more than 170 people and wounding well over one thousand, the majority civilians.\n\nRelated: Thousands of Gaza Civilians Flee After Israeli Warning\n\nThere were several telling points about Schieffer\u2019s exchange with the Israeli Prime Minister. First, it is undeniable that for the Israeli public, living under the constant threat of rocket attacks falls somewhere on the scale between unnerving and terrifying. But the fact that Tel Aviv evidently went from high alert to all clear in a matter of minutes is also significant \u2013 and it suggests that there may be no quick solution to the current conflict.\n\nIsrael is protected by a missile defense system known as the \u201cIron Dome.\u201d Using technology largely supplied by the United States, the Israeli military can track rockets from almost the moment they leave Gaza, and by analyzing their trajectory, identify those that are a threat to the civilian population. Any rockets headed toward vulnerable areas are promptly shot down before they can do any damage.\n\nTo date, no Israelis have been killed by the Hamas rocket fire, and only a handful have been injured. In an appearance earlier Sunday morning on Fox News Sunday, Netanyahu praised the Iron Dome system and said, \u201cI want to thank the U.S. people, President Obama and the Congress\u201d for helping finance it.\n\nBut while the missile defense system is undoubtedly saving Israeli lives, in an ironic twist, some analysts believe that it is likely to prolong the conflict with Hamas by reducing pressure on Netanyahu to negotiate a cease-fire.\n\nRelated: Is Obama\u2019s America Becoming More European\n\nBecause it is so densely populated and so close to Israel, the only way for Israel to guarantee an end to the rocket attacks is to either mount a full-scale invasion of Gaza, or to negotiate an agreement with Hamas.\n\nIsrael has called up tens of thousands of army reservists and has sent tanks to the border, but few believe an invasion is in the offing. Appearing on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press Martin Indyk, until recently the U.S. Special Envoy for Israeli\u2013Palestinian Negotiations, said bluntly, \u201cThe bluff of massing tanks on the border is not working.\u201d\n\nThat leaves negotiation, and on the Israeli side, the lack of casualties due to the effectiveness of the Iron Dome has blunted pressure for Netanyahu to aggressively seek a negotiated settlement, leaving the military free to continue attacking Hamas in Gaza.\n\nAs for Hamas, the group has historically not let civilian casualties from Israeli counterstrikes stand in the way of its attacks. In fact, it has frequently used such collateral damage to help it raise funds from anti-Israel governments and individuals across the Middle East.\n\nRelated: Sectarian Genie Is Out of the Bottle from Syria to Iraq\n\nMaking matters worse, Egypt, possibly the only country that has enough credibility with both the Israelis and Hamas to serve as a broker in any negotiation, has so far shown little appetite for getting involved in the situation.\n\nThe facts on the ground in Israel, experts say, suggest a conflict with no end in sight.\n\nAppearing on CNN\u2019s State of the Union, veteran Middle East peace negotiator Aaron David Miller, an adviser to six U.S. Secretaries of State, was unequivocally pessimistic.\n\n\u201cEffective mediation requires urgency, a mediator, and a deal,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd frankly right now, you don\u2019t have any of those things. Hamas and Israel are simply not done, there is no deal on the table, and the Egyptians seem reluctant.\u201d\n\nHe concluded by adding, \u201cThe tragedy of this entire enterprise is likely to play out for a good while longer.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "In an unusual bit of drama on the Sunday talk shows, an interview with Israeli Prime M", "title": "Israel\u2019s \u201cIron Dome\u201d Could Prolong Gaza Conflict", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/07/13/Israel-s-Iron-Dome-Could-Prolong-Gaza-Conflict", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/07132014_Iron_Dome_Interceptor_Rocket_Launcher.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/07/13/Israel-s-Iron-Dome-Could-Prolong-Gaza-Conflict", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/07132014_Iron_Dome_Interceptor_Rocket_Launcher.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@rrgarver"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "In an unusual bit of drama on the Sunday talk shows, an interview with Israeli Prime M", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb9f6\"", "article_summary": "The overnight raid was the first ground incursion by Israel into the Gaza Strip during this most recent conflict, but it was not Israel\u2019s only defensive action.\nRelated: Thousands of Gaza Civilians Flee After Israeli WarningThere were several telling points about Schieffer\u2019s exchange with the Israeli Prime Minister.\nOver the past several days, the Israeli military has conducted some 1,300 airstrikes in the densely populated Palestinian area, killing more than 170 people and wounding well over one thousand, the majority civilians.\nThe facts on the ground in Israel, experts say, suggest a conflict with no end in sight.\n\u201cWhen we began this interview we were under bomb alert,\u201d Netanyahu explained as he listened to the announcement."}
