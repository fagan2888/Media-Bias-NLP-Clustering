WASHINGTON, Sept. 27 (UPI) -- Michele Bachmann is bored with the gay marriage debate. Michelangelo Signorile interviewed her for the SiriusXM Progress at the Values Voter Summit on Friday and asked Bachmann how she feels about gay marriage now. Bachmann reportedly said it was not an issue she's concerned with at this point, and, "In fact, it's boring."

Bachmann has previously been known to compare homosexuals to pedophiles and has supported every anti-gay marriage legislation she has come across. This new statement appears to show she is moving on to other debates.

While Bachmann may be moving on from her long-standing and outspoken opposition to allowing gay marriage, many in her political party have not given up. Ted Cruz of Texas brought up the topic recently at the Values Voters Summit in Washington, D.C. "How do we win? We defend the values that are American values. We stand for life. We stand for marriage," Cruz said, among other things. Republicans who oppose gay marriage may be losing support, as Pew reports 61 percent of young Republicans now favor legalizing gay marriage, though only 22 percent of people over the age of 65 currently support it. More than half of Americans overall, regardless of political affiliation, support gay marriage.
