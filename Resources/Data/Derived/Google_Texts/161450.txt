Runners take on chilly Cary half marathon

hello

Hours before college basketball fans learned which teams are in the field for the NCAA Tournament, dozens of runners took the streets of Cary for a different sort of March Madness.

Runners in the annual March Madness Half Marathon took off from Cary-Grove High School on a sometimes snowy 13.1-mile course that also took them through Mink Trail before finishing up back to the high school.

The race is a fundraiser for the Hillstrider Distance Running Scholarship in memory of Fritz Kauffman. Kauffman was a past president of the Hillstriders Running Club and the 1994 March Madness Half Marathon race director.

The Hillstriders Distance Running Scholarship was established in 2002 to assist McHenry County high school graduates with college expenses.
