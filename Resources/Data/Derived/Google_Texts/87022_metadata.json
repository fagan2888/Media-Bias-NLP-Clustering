On Tuesday, the administration released some details on who these people are -- and how their insurance choices this year compare to what they chose last year.\n\nOf the 4.2 million people who were returning customers, about half let themselves be automatically re-enrolled with the same plan. The rest came back to HealthCare.gov and contemplated their options, with roughly equal numbers selecting new plans or sticking with what they had before.\n\nIn the end, about 29 percent of the returning customers -- 1.2 million people -- found new Obamacare insurance this year.\n\nThat might not sound like such a large number. But by insurance standards, it is. Among those who said they expected the number to be lower was Andrew Slavitt, who is principal deputy administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and is about to become the acting administrator.\n\n\u201cThis is a much more active consumer than anybody expected,\u201d Slavitt told The Wall Street Journal's Louise Radnofsky, whose story first reported those numbers. \u201cWe wanted to create maximum choice while we had maximum protection.\u201d\n\nWhile it\u2019s impossible to know (at least from these data) exactly why people switched plans, price was likely a big factor. With new insurers entering the market and others adjusting premiums based on their data from last year\u2019s business, lots of Obamacare consumers had opportunities to save money. But many had to change policies in order to realize those savings. In some cases, those who stuck with the same plans were subject to significantly higher costs because -- under the formula the government uses to calculate Obamacare\u2019s tax credits -- the level of available financial assistance declines when cheaper plans become available in a particular location. (The Huffington Post\u2019s Jeffrey Young explained all this last year, if you want the details.)\n\nQuality of coverage may also have played into decisions. Many Obamacare plans have strictly limited networks of doctors or high out-of-pocket costs. Some consumers switching plans may have been seeking access to more providers or more protection from those co-payments and deductibles -- although, again, there\u2019s no way to know right now. It\u2019s equally possible, for example, that some people were happy to make do with even more restricted networks if it meant they could save more money on premiums next year.\n\nFewer people may change plans in future years, health care experts noted, once insurers develop a better sense of how to price competitively and once consumers become better acquainted with their options. \u201cThat mixing should settle down once these markets reach an equilibrium -- probably within the next couple of years,\u201d Linda Blumberg, senior fellow at the Urban Institute, told The Huffington Post. \u201cBut it\u2019s definitely the consequence of an actively competitive dynamic.\u201d\n\nOne number that didn\u2019t seem to surprise many experts was the more than 4 million people, or about half the total using the federally run website, who were using it for the first time. The \u201cnon-group\u201d insurance market -- that is, the market for people buying coverage on their own, rather than through an employer -- has always been fluid. People gain or lose jobs at large companies that provide benefits. They get married and divorced, changing their access to plans through spouses, or their incomes fluctuate, making them eligible or ineligible for Medicaid. Some people will continue to buy their own insurance, year after year, but that number tends to be lower than the number who keep employer plans -- or stay on a program like Medicare -- for long periods of time.\n\nOf course, the majority of HealthCare.gov customers, old and new, could lose their insurance altogether later this year, if the Supreme Court rules in favor of a challenge to the federal government\u2019s authority to distribute Obamacare's financial assistance in states that rely on the federally run site. Oral arguments in that case, King v. Burwell, will take place next Wednesday.\n\n\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Health Care Reform Efforts Throughout History Health Care Reform Efforts Throughout History\n\n1 of 17 1912 Former President Theodore Roosevelt champions national health insurance as he unsuccessfully tries to ride his progressive Bull Moose Party back to the White House.
