Jay Rockefeller, a retiring Democrat freed from the political correctness of most of his colleagues. \u201cI\u2019m not getting into that in any way, shape or form. And not to avoid your question, but just to keep my conscience.\u201d\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Bush weighs in on Garner case)\n\nBut even some Republicans believe the next two years could bring a vacancy \u2014 and they\u2019re more blunt about the reasons than Democrats.\n\n\u201cGiven the health and age of some I think it has to be viewed as a possibility,\u201d Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) warned.\n\nBut even as those Democrats avoid any criticisms of individual justices, they quietly fret over the potential of a court vacancy during the next two years, whether it be Ginsburg, one of the three justices that are in their late 70s \u2014 or anyone else on the court that is now narrowly controlled by conservatives.\n\n\u201cI always worry about that. That\u2019s a big, big thing. A vacancy on the court? It\u2019s a huge thing,\u201d said Sen. Barbara Boxer, a California Democrat. \u201cAnd the court is showing itself to be a very activist court and it\u2019s very upsetting. Because we\u2019re seeing decisions that are not good for the people.\u201d\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Obama cites 'deep unfairness' in how laws are enforced)\n\nConsidering President Barack Obama\u2019s track record of nominating liberal justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, Democrats will be expecting much the same if there\u2019s another vacancy regardless of whose seat becomes vacant. But since those 2009 and 2010 confirmations, the party has now lost more a dozen seats. And both the court \u2014 and the Senate \u2014 have become sharply more partisan. Now, the court is set to reconsider Democrats\u2019 most substantial achievement in Obamacare, a challenge to the law\u2019s subsidies that Republicans believe stands a real chance of being overturned.\n\nAdd it all up and there are very real Democratic worries that the first GOP-controlled Senate during Obama\u2019s presidency could spell major difficulties not only for confirmation of a new liberal justice, but for Democrats\u2019 hard-fought legislative legacies of the last six years.\n\nIn interviews with 10 Senate Democrats across the party\u2019s ideological spectrum, senators declined to second-guess Ginsburg\u2019s decision to stay on into the GOP majority.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just the taboo of second-guessing a sitting justice that keeps the Democrats from playing Monday morning quarterback \u2014 there\u2019s also nothing they can do. So rather than criticize the close liberal ally, Democrats praise her recent shows of vitality, her physical fitness, full court load and quick returns to work.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: 17 states sue to block Obama immigration order)\n\nDemocrats say they have no reason to believe that Ginsburg can\u2019t help carry the court\u2019s block of four liberal justices into 2017, the next year that Democrats could possibly control both the Senate and the White House. If Ginsburg had any doubts about her ability to do that, they argue, her seat would already be vacant.\n\n\u201cJustice Ginsburg has never missed a day of work, including this. She has shown no signs of not wanting to serve, and so she is certainly entitled to serve. So, there is no vacancy,\u201d said Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), a senior member of the Judiciary Committee.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m always concerned, because there could be a vacancy any time. I have no information that there is about to be a vacancy,\u201d said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), another panel member. Ginsburg is \u201cvery hardy, energetic and talented.\u201d\n\nGiven the increasing partisanship in the Senate over Obama\u2019s nominees, it\u2019s almost assured that whoever President Barack Obama would pick must have to clear a filibuster and garner 60 votes to win confirmation \u2014 rather than the majority threshold for every other type of nominee, a quirk of Senate Democrats\u2019 rules change. That means that any vacancy will need more than a dozen Republicans\u2019 support, not to mention sufficient backing to get out of committee in the first place.\n\nIncoming Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) declined to tip his hand on how his committee might handle the massive task of Supreme Court nomination \u2014 or even whether Republicans are preparing for that possibility.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to think about that until we have one. I think they will be handled the same way we\u2019ve handled Supreme Court nominees in the past,\u201d he said.\n\nOf course, there\u2019s quite a few ways Supreme Court nominees have been handled in the past. Harriet Miers\u2019s nomination was withdrawn in 2005 after bipartisan angst built up over her qualifications, with nine other Supreme Court nominees ultimately winning confirmation since Ronald Reagan\u2019s nominations of Douglas Ginsburg and Robert Bork were scuttled in 1987. Ginsburg herself was confirmed 96-3 during Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency \u2014 but no one believes that a nomination to replace her or any other justice would go so smoothly these days.\n\nRepublicans \u201cobviously want to control the court when they consider all the political decisions it has made,\u201d said Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.). \u201cIt would be a full on blood bath, I would expect.\u201d\n\nIf there is a vacancy while the GOP controls the Senate, Democrats say, the trick will be for Democratic senators to work with the White House to identify someone that transcends the political trench warfare of the Senate\u2019s rancorous confirmation process by marrying liberal credentials with an apolitical reputation.\n\n\u201cNovember just made it tougher. So if there would be a vacancy, the president would have to be extremely adroit in who he would send up,\u201d said Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.). \u201cI know that they would be creative in terms of trying to send up somebody who the president felt comfortable with but could garner the maximum support.\u201d\n\nStill McCain said the Supreme Court nomination process has gotten steadily more acrimonious during his 30 years on Capitol Hill, though he said he will seek to steer his party toward a confirmation process elevated from the daily tug of partisan politics. But Republicans still mention Clarence Thomas\u2019s difficult confirmation when asked about the Supreme Court \u2014 a reminder that old grudges die hard.\n\nGiven Democrats\u2019 large majorities during the Sotomayor and Kagan confirmations, it\u2019s hard to say what a Supreme Court vacancy looks like in a Senate where filibusters and procedural warfare seem to tighten by the day and with Republicans holding at least a six-seat advantage.\n\nStill, Democrats are hopeful: Both that Ginsburg will remain as vital as they say she is, and that Republicans would enter a confirmation battle with an open mind. After all, they\u2019ve got little other choice.\n\n\u201cSupreme Court vacancies receive such attention that it would be extremely difficult to prevent an up-or-down vote on a Supreme Court nominee,\u201d said Maryland Democratic Sen. Ben Cardin. \u201cPresident Obama \u2026 I know he\u2019ll be very careful in who he selects. So it would be very challenging to vote against a nominee just because of politics.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Democrats don\u2019t want to talk about the justice\u2019s health or age.", "title": "The Ruth Bader Ginsburg taboo", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/12/ruth-bader-ginsburg-113357.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/12/05/14125_ginsburg_msm_629.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Chuck Grassley,Jay Rockefeller,Dianne Feinstein,Tim Kaine,Supreme Court,John McCain,Ruth Bader Ginsburg,Sheldon Whitehouse,Senate,Ben Cardin,Democrats,Barbara Boxer,Richard Blumenthal", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "Democrats don\u2019t want to talk about the justice\u2019s health or age.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdb62\"", "article_summary": "Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is back on the bench after a hospital stay where doctors implanted a stent \u2014 another health scare for the octogenarian and two-time cancer survivor.\n\u201cSupreme Court vacancies receive such attention that it would be extremely difficult to prevent an up-or-down vote on a Supreme Court nominee,\u201d said Maryland Democratic Sen.
