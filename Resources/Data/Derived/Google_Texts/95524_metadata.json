When he makes up his mind, later, after pretending to consider all the details, he will come to the conclusion, probably, in all likelihood, that this\u2019n here\u2019s a shit deal.\n\nAwaiting more details on #Iran deal but early reports indicate this is Obama admin spinning diplomatic failure. \u2014 Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) April 2, 2015\n\nFormer Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who is still a thing(?), tweeted, \u201cAmericans and our allies are right to be wary of a nuclear deal w/ Iran that is riddled with concessions by the Obama Administration.\u201d\n\nTed Cruz: not a fan.\n\nScott Walker, also, too, does not like the political framework for a nuclear deal with Iran.\n\nThe absolute best \u201cresponse,\u201d though, was from our man Sen. Rand Paul. The \u201cold Rand,\u201d who had all sorts of problems but was certainly the type to support diplomatic negotiations over Iran\u2019s nuclear program, remains in conflict with the \u201cnew Rand,\u201d the generic defense budget-busting hawk who aims to be president. How did Paul reconcile his two selves? His staff is telling reporters that the senator \u201cis out of pocket with family and not doing any media all week long.\u201d (We\u2019re not sure about the lingo, \u201cout of pocket.\u201d Is this a thing? Does he mean \u201cout of the pocket,\u201d like he\u2019s a quarterback scrambling for his life? That would be apt.) Rand Paul is conveniently not commenting on any news, be it the Iran talks or the Indiana RFRA or the Miley Cyrus/Tom Cotton stand-off, until after he officially announces his presidential bid next week. \u201cNot saying anything\u201d is always Rand Paul\u2019s best option, but it\u2019s not sustainable in the long-term.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republican hopefuls are swaggering about they'd cancel an Iran nuclear deal.
