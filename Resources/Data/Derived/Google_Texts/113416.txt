The Bradley County Sheriff's Office was at Mix 104.1’s Great Cleveland Duck Race on Friday afternoon. Sheriff Eric Watson led off the motorcade that brought American Idol's Clark Beckham to the Duck Race. Beckham was runner up on American Idol this year.

The Mobile Incident Command Center was parked near the new Greenway Stage for the event, as well, with giveaways and information available.

Sheriff Watson said, “It was a great way to get out and talk to people at a great event.”
