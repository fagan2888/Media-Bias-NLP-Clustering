The C-17 Globemaster plant is the last of its kind in California.\n\nThe engineering jobs will be centered in Long Beach and Seal Beach and will include the operation team, which deals with Boeing airplane issues anywhere in the world 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The move has been described as designating Southern California as the customer support center.\n\nBoeing\u2019s Southern California Engineering Design Center support will be responsible for the 737, 747, 767 and 777 passenger jets, as well as commercial product support for the KC-46 Tanker and P-8 Poseidon anti-submarine warfare aircraft. Boeing already assigned responsibilities for supporting several legacy aircraft to engineers based in Southern California. Boeing is dedicating its Puget Sound area facilities to the promotion of new aircraft \u2014 the 787 Dreamliner, the 737 MAX and the 777X.\n\nThe Southern California Engineering Design Center employs about 1,800 people at the in Long Beach and Seal Beach sites.\n\nThe move, rumored for months, is the latest in a series of engineering transfers out of Seattle that totals more than 4,300 Boeing jobs.\n\n\n\nCSUDH Celebrates Hagan\n\nCARSON \u2014 Willie J.

I directed her to take a hard look at DWP\u2019s rates and bring reform. Look, we can\u2019t ask you to pay more for your water and power when the DWP screws up your bill.\n\n\u201cSo I will not allow the DWP to raise rates this year. The department must earn back your trust.\u201d\n\nHe acknowledged the challenges in the city for businesses.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, our city is still home to the highest and most complicated business tax of any of the 88 cities in Los Angeles County,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a tax that taxes you even when you lose money \u2014 this chases new businesses away and pushes existing businesses to leave.\n\n\u201cWe must phase out the business tax entirely. Next week, I will introduce legislation as part of this year\u2019s budget that will be our first down-payment toward this goal. Our plan will cut the top business tax rate over 3 years \u2014 the top rate that nearly half of businesses pay.\n\nHis third priority was to focus on quality of life in neighborhoods.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the point of my \u2018Great Streets\u201d initiative,\u201d he said. \u201cHere\u2019s how it works: We\u2019ll saturate your street with services. We\u2019ll make your street accessible to pedestrians, wheelchairs, strollers and bicycles\u2013not just cars.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll create an environment where new neighborhood businesses can flourish. We\u2019ll pave the streets and make them green streets \u2014 clean and lush with plant life, local art, and people-focused plazas\u2026. On Gaffey Street in San Pedro, were going to join forces with its burgeoning creative community.\u201d\n\nIn addition to declaring his goal of bringing rail to LAX, he announced that improvement work on the 405 Interstate is ahead of schedule.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud to announce that the new lane on the 405 freeway will open not in October, but next month. And we did it through good management, and it didn\u2019t cost us a dollar extra.\u201d\n\nFugitive Mother is in Custody\n\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 On April 10, a Slovakian native who became a fugitive after taking her children overseas in violation of court custody orders was returned to the United States to face prosecution, announced Bill Lewis, the assistant director of the FBI\u2019s Los Angeles Field Office and Chief Charlie Beck of the Los Angeles Police Department.\n\nMaria Pfeifer, age 32, a former resident of Los Angeles, is suspected of taking her children out of the United States in violation of court ordered custody terms in Los Angeles.\n\nAccording to LAPD detectives, Pfeifer took the children to the Czech Republic and Slovakia in June 2012 and did not return the following month, as scheduled, in July 2012. Pfeifer\u2019s failure to return the children violated the parental rights of the children\u2019s respective fathers, according to detectives. FBI assistance was requested when investigators determined that Pfeifer intended to remain overseas with the children.\n\nIn August 2013, LAPD detectives obtained an arrest warrant and Pfeifer was charged by the Los Angeles County District Attorney with two felony counts of Child Detention with Right to Custody, a violation of California Penal Code 278.5. In September 2013, Pfeifer was further charged in a federal criminal complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles with Unlawful Flight to Avoid Prosecution, a violation of Title 18; United States Code; Section 1073. The court later granted the victims\u2019 fathers full custody of their children while Pfeifer was a fugitive.\n\nPfeifer is known to have spent time in her native Slovakia, Germany and France, and investigators concentrated their focus in those areas, among others, where leads were generated. Earlier this year, a tip was received on a social website operated by one of the victim fathers, which led investigators to a location in France where Pfeifer had been residing with the children.\n\nAgents with the FBI\u2019s Los Angeles Field Office collaborated with the FBI\u2019s legal attach\u00e9 stationed in Paris, France, and French law enforcement authorities to recover the victim children.\n\nIn December 2013, Pfeifer was arrested at the FBI\u2019s request by French law enforcement officers without incident in Divonne-les-Bains, France. Shortly thereafter, the children were reunited with their fathers and returned to the United States.\n\nAt her required court appearance in France, Pfeifer was granted bail and had remained overseas since her arrest. Pfeifer was returned to the United States escorted by FBI Agents and was turned over to detectives with the Los Angeles Police Department upon arriving to Los Angeles International Airport.\n\nThe federal complaint charging UFAP is expected to be dismissed and Pfeifer will be prosecuted by the Los Angeles County District Attorney\u2019s Office.\n\n\n\nBipartisan effort launched to combat demand-side of child-sex trafficking\n\nLOS ANGELES \u2013 On April 11, Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors Chairman Don Knabe, joined by a bipartisan panel of lawmakers that included Sen. Ted Lieu formally announced legislation and an increased public awareness campaign to push for harsher penalties for people who buy, sell and exploit young girls for sex.\n\nThat, included Lieu\u2019s Senate Bill 1388 to strengthen penalties for buyers and sellers of minors for sex.\n\nJoining Knabe and Lieu in calling on lawmakers to develop a plan to increase penalties on those convicted of promoting or participating in the sexual trafficking of minors at the front steps of the Kenneth Hahn Hall of Administration were Sen. Bob Huff, R-San Diego, and Daphne Phung, founder of California Against Slavery.\n\nThe event followed the unanimous vote earlier that week by the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors to support a package of bills that includes: longer jail time for sex buyers; adding human trafficking to a list of gang-related activities; allowing wiretapping to be used in sex-trafficking cases; and streamlining a victim\u2019s testimony against her exploiter.\n\nKnabe also announced the launch of a new public awareness campaign that will appear on Metro buses and trains, and on billboards provided by Clear Channel Outdoor.\n\nController Finds $10 Million \u2018Languishing\u2019 in Fund\n\nLOS ANGELES \u2013 On April 11, Controller Ron Galperin released an audit that found that money collected from property developers to pay for public art projects \u201cis languishing in the City\u2019s Arts Development Fee Trust Fund.\u201d\n\nHe urged the Department of Cultural Affairs to uphold the public trust by investing the money in the art for which it was intended.\n\nThe city collects a \u201c1% for Art\u201d fee from commercial developers to pay for public art installations near their real estate projects. These projects are called \u201cDeveloper Paid-In.\u201d (\u201cDeveloper-Led\u201d projects allow developers to pay for the art themselves. And in the case of \u201cPublic Works Improvement Arts Projects,\u201d the city pays for the art component.)\n\nThe audit found that, since 2006, 428 different private development projects contributed arts fees to the Development Fee Trust Fund totaling more than $7.7 million. But 2007 guidelines from the City Attorney\u2019s Office mandated that art projects be placed within a \u201cone-block geographical radius\u201d of the related construction projects, which severely restricted the Department of Cultural Affairs\u2019 ability to use the funds. Just 32 new public art projects were created with the money.\n\nPrior to completing the audit, the city controller consulted with City Attorney Mike Feuer. Together, they are working collaboratively with stakeholders and lawmakers to update and improve the guidelines about where public art can be located.\n\nLos Angeles\u2019 1% for Art ordinances have been catalysts for more than 1,000 murals, sculptures, monuments, and other artistic creations. Yet since 2008, the audit found, the Development Fee Trust Fund has collected an average of $1.3 million annually from property developers, but spent just $654,000 on the arts.\n\nGalperin\u2019s audit is being released just three days after his office released a report on the City\u2019s 974 special funds, which accounted for 89 percent of the city\u2019s $8.9 billion in cash assets as of December 31, 2013. The Arts Development Fee Trust Fund is one such special fund.\n\nBoth the 1% for Arts audit and the report on special funds can be found on the Controller\u2019s website at http://controller.lacity.org/index.htm\n\n\n\nHumboldt Bus Accident Harbor Area Victims\n\nORLAND, Calif. \u2014 At 5:41 p.m., April 10, students were being shuttled by a charter bus going to Humboldt State University\u2019s Spring Preview event.\n\nThe bus was traveling along Interstate 5 near Orland, about 100 miles north of Sacramento, when a FedEx truck collided with the bus. Investigators say the truck driver might have been trying to avoid a passenger car that was also involved in the crash.A Nissan Altima was struck by the truck before it crashed into the bus, according to the CHP. Public safety dispatcher Joline Wise said no one in the Altima was injured.\n\nThe accident resulted in 10 deaths and more than 30 injuries, California Highway Patrol officials said. Nine victims were pronounced dead at the scene, Carpenter said. One other victim, who suffered severe burns, died after being airlifted to UC Davis Medical Center. Five students were killed in the collision, as were the three chaperones and the drivers of the bus and the big rig, according to CHP Lt. Bruce Carpenter.\n\nForty-eight people were on the bus \u2014 44 students, three chaperones and one driver, the CHP said.\n\nBoth vehicles exploded in flames, sending plumes of thick black smoke high into the air.\n\nThe vehicles were charred. The drivers of the bus and truck were killed, along with eight other people inside the bus, police said.\n\nSeventeen-year-old Angelica Flores-Cruz of California Academy of Mathematics and Science and 18-year-old Sineva Samantha Hosea of Polytechnic High School were involved in the deadly charter bus accident. Officials said both students sustained non-life-threatening injuries, Long Beach Unified School District officials said.\n\nAt a news conference April 11, Los Angeles Unified School District officials released the following list of 16 schools attended by the 19 Los Angeles-area students who were on the bus: Banning High School, Carson High School, Wilson High School, Belmont, Chatsworth, Chavez, City of Angels, Diego Rivera, Dorsey, Fremont, Grant, Jefferson, Manual Arts, Middle College, Robert F. Kennedy Community Schools and San Fernando High School.\n\nThe officials stressed that they could not confirm whether any of LAUSD students were among the victims.\n\nSebelius Resigns as Health Secretary\n\nWASHINGTON, D.C. \u2014 On April 10, Kathleen Sebelius resigned as the secretary of Health and Human Services.\n\nPresident Barack Obama tapped budget director, Sylvia Mathews Burwell, to replace her.\n\nSebelius faced harsh criticism for the Affordable Care Act rollout \u2013 one in which the Barack Obama administration reportedly came close to scrapping Health and Human Services\u2019 website, Healthcare.gov. She appeared blindsided by the problems that were evident upon the site\u2019s launch Oct. 1, and she accepted responsibility for her department\u2019s failures.\n\nSebelius recently announced that total enrollment now exceeds 7.5 million, a half million people beyond the administration\u2019s goal for 2014. And that number continues to rise, as enrollments that were started before the March 31 cutoff date are completed. The website\u2019s initial dysfunction was corrected this past fall.\n\nThe resignation also sets in motion a succession process that includes Senate confirmation hearings for Burwell. Burwell has been budget director only since April 2013 and went through Senate confirmation to take that post.\n\nBurwell is a graduate of Harvard University and Oxford, where she was a Rhodes scholar.\n\nIf confirmed, Burwell will have her work cut out for her at Health and Human Services. While Healthcare.gov is now functioning, more or less, the site will go through extensive upgrades and retooling in preparation for the next open enrollment period, which begins Nov. 15. In addition, Insurers will soon be setting rates for next year, as they see who has enrolled for 2014.\n\nThis past year, the Senate confirmed her on a vote of 96 to 0 as director of the Office of Management and Budget.\n\nCIA\u2019s \u2018Harsh Interrogations\u2019 Exceeded Legal Authority\n\nWASHINGTON, D.C. \u2014 On April 10, McClatchy news service reported that classified Senate report found that the CIA\u2019s legal justification for the use of harsh interrogation techniques was based on faulty legal reasoning.\n\nThe Central Intelligence Agency also issued erroneous claims about how many people it subjected to techniques such as simulated drowning, or \u201cwater boarding,\u201d citing conclusions from the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence report obtained by McClatchy.\n\nThe report also concluded that the CIA used interrogation methods that were not approved by its own headquarters or the Justice Department, impeded White House oversight and actively evaded oversight both by Congress and its own inspector general.\n\nThe CIA also provided false information to the Justice Department, which used that information to conclude that the methods would not break the law because those applying them did not specifically intend to inflict severe pain or suffering, the report added.\n\nHuman rights activists called for the immediate declassification of the entire document.\n\nA version of the report was finished in 2012, but it was revised before the Senate committee voted in favor of declassifying parts of it, including its findings and conclusions, on April 3.\n\nMcClatchy posted this link to what it said were the list of findings in the Intelligence committee report: http://tinyurl.com/SenateIntelligence\n\nNo widget added yet.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Random Lengths News", "description": "Update on Efforts to Keep Boeing in Long Beach LONG BEACH \u2014 On April 10, Boeing told its employees that by the end of next year, it will transfer 1,000 engineering jobs from the Puget Sound to Southern California.
