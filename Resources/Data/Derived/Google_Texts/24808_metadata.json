The 4th District was and is heavily Republican and Mowrer was running for public office for the first time.\n\nTwo years later, Mowrer is again running for Congress. He has more political experience, including time traveling the state as vice chairman of the Iowa Democratic Party. He was a friend of Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s late son, Beau, and has national political connections. He\u2019s already proven himself a capable fundraiser, with about $2 million donated last cycle. Meanwhile, King has ruffled some feathers within the GOP and attracted a Republican primary opponent with some deep-pocketed supporters.\n\nBut Mowrer isn\u2019t running against King. After the 2014 election, he moved his family from Boone, where he was born and raised, to a Des Moines home he has owned since 2007. He announced last summer that he would run in the 3rd District, where Republican Congressman David Young is seeking re-election to a second term.\n\nThere\u2019s a three-way primary race for the Democratic nomination that is becoming more active now that the filing deadline has passed. Mike Sherzan and Desmund Adams, both West Des Moines businessmen, have announced campaign events in the district this week. Young has also scheduled public events in the district this week and has a Republican opponent, Joe Grandanette, who sought the nomination in 2014.\n\nBuy Photo Democrat Jim Mowrer campaigns for the the 3rd Congressional District nomination.

Rod Blum is trying to win a second term. In the 3rd District, Republicans outnumber Democrats by about 8,100 active registrations. But the Cook Political Report recently ranked both races as toss-ups.\n\nI caught up with Mowrer last week at a campaign event in Des Moines. He was rolling out endorsements aimed at showing his strength in the primary, but he also telegraphed lines of attack against Young.\n\nBuy Photo Jim Mowrer, candidate for Iowa's 3rd congressional district, gestures to the crowd at the 2014 Jefferson Jackson Dinner on Saturday, Oct. 25, 2014, at Hy-Vee Hall in Des Moines, Iowa.

If you don\u2019t, there might be a problem. Just the amount of work it takes and how to go about communicating your message, what are the right ways to go about that. And so I\u2019m very confident we\u2019re going to run the strongest campaign, nobody\u2019s going to outwork me. I don\u2019t take anything for granted but I\u2019m very confident that we\u2019re going to win.\u201d\n\nVoter anger: \u201cI would say that people are definitely frustrated and in some cases, angry. I mean, we have basically gotten nothing done in Washington over the past few years because of the obstructionism and the divide that exists. And so, I think what we need to focus on is changing that as we move forward and focus that energy on making a positive impact in the future. But we have a lot of people out there stoking that fear and anger. They want people to be afraid, they want people to be angry and that\u2019s not what real leadership is.\u201d\n\nTargeting Young: \u201cJust in the first year and a half in office, I think he\u2019s provided a good look as to why he does not deserve another term. He\u2019s voted twice against the equal pay act, he\u2019s voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act six times \u2026 he\u2019s voted to defund Planned Parenthood and shut down the government several times. He was one of only 64 members of Congress and the only member of the Iowa delegation to vote against the bipartisan highway bill. And there was just a report out a couple of weeks ago that said Iowa has the third most deficient roads and bridges in the country, and when we have a representative who is voting against the highway bill, basic funding for roads and bridges, I think that people are going to say that\u2019s not representative of what we need in Iowa.\u201d\n\nU.S. Rep. David Young (Photo: Special to the Register)\n\nYoung response: James Carstensen, spokesman for Young, took issue in particular with Mowrer's comments that Young had voted to \"shut down the government.\" Carstensen also pointed out that Young voted for the highway package on final passage. \"David has never voted for a government shutdown \u2014 period. The other claims are also false. This candidate is clearly quite confused. He must be recycling his old talking points from his failed run for Congress just a few months ago in another part of Iowa.\"\n\nQ: Are you at all kicking yourself that you\u2019re not running in the 4th District this year?\n\n\u201cWell, you know, after the last election I moved back to the home I\u2019ve had in Des Moines for about a decade and was not planning on running this cycle but there is so much at stake and so many important issues that I\u2019m excited to represent the 3rd District and all Iowans and all Americans, of course, in Congress because you know, there\u2019s so many issues that affect everyone and so I\u2019m focused on the race here.\u201d\n\nQ: But you are kicking yourself, just a little?\n\nMowrer grins. \u201cNo, no, no. no. Not at all.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/1Mx6ZMb", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Race for seat heats up as Democrats announce campaign events", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600025120", "og": {"site_name": "Des Moines Register", "description": "Race for seat heats up as Democrats announce campaign events", "title": "3rd District: Mowrer hits Young over votes in Congress", "url": "http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/opinion/columnists/kathie-obradovich/2016/03/28/3rd-district-mowrer-hits-young-over-votes-congress/82351908/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/desmoinesregister.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Race for seat heats up as Democrats announce campaign events", "creator": "@DMRegister", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/db37794507ab15783c1a8291933affbea6df90d1/c=0-0-1200-1200&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/DesMoines/2015/03/11/B9316568763Z.1_20150311181735_000_G03A6APGC.1-0.jpg", "title": "3rd District: Mowrer hits Young over votes in Congress", "site": "@DMRegister", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "p": {"domain_verify": "372c291dc2b106308d26264f4fba3b10"}, "fb": {"app_id": 169766623060429}, "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Organizations/U.S. House of Representatives", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Organizations/U.S. House of Representatives", "title": "3rd District: Mowrer hits Young over votes in Congress", "author": "Kathie Obradovich", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "opinion/columnists/kathie-obradovich", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/deb122a7e4d0f06fc658a0d13e7e7419c3c19d7e/c=150-0-1050-1200/local/-/media/DesMoines/2015/03/11/B9316568763Z.1_20150311181735_000_G03A6APGC.1-0.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3378dda7853bbdfd8fbe80a4f2a097a7622c7b4c/c=0-0-1200-1200/local/-/media/DesMoines/2015/03/11/B9316568763Z.1_20150311181735_000_G03A6APGC.1-0.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f983940a0db78459e8f0f10cca161424d97075c3/c=0-67-1200-969/local/-/media/DesMoines/2015/03/11/B9316568763Z.1_20150311181735_000_G03A6APGC.1-0.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a6be40508d9ed2a24aae40bbf7e213c844c5056d/c=0-262-1200-937&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/DesMoines/2015/03/11/B9316568763Z.1_20150311181735_000_G03A6APGC.1-0.jpg", "publishtime": "2016-03-28T19:30:02.293000-05:00", "shorthed": "3rd District: Mowrer aims at new target", "articleid": 82351908, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/53b230cba73675d738fe8224825feb7d630afa39/c=0-262-1200-937/local/-/media/DesMoines/2015/03/11/B9316568763Z.1_20150311181735_000_G03A6APGC.1-0.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a4c2a742550af9468d5bfde8839ed05f54d6e413/c=285-0-957-1200/local/-/media/DesMoines/2015/03/11/B9316568763Z.1_20150311181735_000_G03A6APGC.1-0.jpg"}}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "He\u2019s voted twice against the equal pay act, he\u2019s voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act six times \u2026 he\u2019s voted to defund Planned Parenthood and shut down the government several times.\nCarstensen also pointed out that Young voted for the highway package on final passage.\nThe 4th District was and is heavily Republican and Mowrer was running for public office for the first time.\nI caught up with Mowrer last week at a campaign event in Des Moines.\nAfter the 2014 election, he moved his family from Boone, where he was born and raised, to a Des Moines home he has owned since 2007."}
