Of that number, 36 individuals will exit the hospital, approximately 14 employees are expected to transfer into other equivalent open positions and eight employees will experience a reduction of hours, while retaining benefits.\n\nNearly two months ago, the Board and Executive Team were examining possible layoffs of nearly 200 employees. In order to prioritize quality of care and safety, this number was substantially reduced by assessing vacancy rates, projected revenue reductions and growth areas, as well as the need to re-align services for the shift to population health in alignment with the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cThis was a difficult decision that was a result of exploring all available options for repositioning our community hospital. Knowing that the ultimate outcome would affect our staff and their families, this decision was not taken lightly for the Board or the Executive Team,\u201d said Bruce Tassin, President & CEO. \u201cOur employees are our most important resource and we can assure our community that this difficult decision was very carefully and deliberately considered before a final plan was developed and implemented. We wish to express appreciation to the community for its support of our employees, their families, and our hospital family during this very difficult and challenging time.\u201d\n\n\u201cEnsuring patient safety and the continued delivery of quality care are our top priorities when making any decisions on repositioning our hospital,\u201d Tassin said. \u201cAs a result, no bedside nurse positions are affected with this reorganization.\u201d\n\nThe number of staff affected by this repositioning was reduced by placing some of them in open positions. Leadership positions account for approximately 33% of the exits. All 36 staff exiting were offered severance packages that will, at minimum, ensure compensation through December 31. Of those exiting, every effort will be made to help them secure an available position within the hospital, providing \u201cfirst-call back\u201d when a vacancy occurs.\n\nThis repositioning is due in part to Affordable Care Act (ACA) reform requirements, but also because of the reductions to Medicare, reduced in-patient volumes, lower reimbursement rates, and, in our case, since FY 2011, we have faced a reduction of Sole Community Provider funding (from Santa Fe County and matching funding from the federal government) of approximately $63 million in total. For FY 2014, we expect an additional reduction of $3.8 million with the potential elimination of the funding in FY 2015.\n\nOne of the main intentions of the ACA is to drive people into primary care and neighborhood clinics and away from emergency rooms for primary care treatment, with focus on health, wellness and prevention. In anticipation of ACA, and because of the funding reductions, CHRISTUS St. Vincent incorporated the new vision for healthcare into our three-year Strategic Plan and have had to reposition our hospital, resulting in an impact to employees.\n\n\u201cACA presents a new health care landscape and we are adapting to make it work. We have to adjust to the new realities,\u201d said CEO Bruce Tassin.\n\nIn light of this reform, during the past few months, CHRISTUS St. Vincent has been exploring and analyzing various options for ensuring the viability of our community hospital in the long term. For example, several measures have been implemented, including an increased focus on driving efficiencies, lowering costs, reducing duplicative services, implementing flex time schedules for non-patient areas, and withholding raises for all Executive and management personnel.\n\nSome have described this reform as \u201cresetting the normal\u201d for healthcare delivery. In response, our colleagues at places like the Cleveland Clinic, Vanderbilt University Medical, and Emory Healthcare in Georgia have already introduced dramatic measures to reposition their organizations and delivery systems. CNBC recently reported on this trend noting that in September 2013 the health-care sector saw the biggest layoffs, with plans to cut 8,128 employees, up from 3,163 in August.\n\nCHRISTUS St. Vincent\u2019s Seven Guiding Principles served as the basis for the Executive Team and Board decision to reposition the hospital. Many of these build upon the mission of our not-for-profit hospital, but also acknowledge how important our employees are to our ability to provide quality care to our patients and our community at large. Here are the Principles:\n\n\u2022 Commitment to values-based decision making\n\n\u2022 Commitment to the charitable mission of the hospital, including clinical excellence\n\n\u2022 Commitment to the financial viability and long term strength of our community hospital\n\n\u2022 Commitment to local access to care and the continuum of care with a focus on population health and strategic plan\n\n\u2022 Commitment to the continuation of services, including the treatment of all patients regardless of their ability to pay\n\n\u2022 Commitment to demonstrating dignity, respect and compassion for all employees\n\n\u2022 Commitment to our people, including efforts at strengthening our culture of quality and compassionate care, teamwork, and spirit of diversity\n\n\u201cI would like to extend our appreciation to Santa Fe County, the Legislative Finance Committee, and the State for their ongoing efforts to explore a mitigation of the Sole Community Provider funding elimination,\u201d Tassin said. \u201cMost importantly, we have some of the most experienced, knowledgeable and caring health care workers in the country. To lose any of them is a loss to our hospital.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "SANTA FE, N.M. \u2014 Santa Fe's Christus St. Vincent Regional Medical Center announced this afternoon that it is laying off 36 employees as well as transferring other workers and reducing hours for some.
