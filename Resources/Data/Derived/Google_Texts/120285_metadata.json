Investors want real steady cash flow and proven business models,\" he added.\n\nThis shift reflects a combination of market volatility, high valuations and growing fears of another tech bubble which have led venture capitalists to reassess risk and back more business-to-business (B2B) start-ups over those aimed at consumers.\n\nVenture capital funds are also seeking a clearer way to cash in their investments. Tech.eu, which analyses tech data, said B2B made up 60 percent of all European exits last year.\n\n\"Investors are shunning non money-making companies. Monetization has become a really big deal,\" said Tim He, a partner at venture capital firm Northzone.\n\nFunds invested in B2B start-ups rose by 40 percent to $11.9 billion year-on-year to the end of March, figures from venture capital database PitchBook show.\n\nAnd although funding for business-to-consumer (B2C) start-ups remains larger, investment in this area fell 9 percent to $24 billion over the same period.\n\nPhilipp Leutiger, a partner at management consulting firm Roland Berger, describes B2B as \"very hot\" with investors hunting for capex-light business models with the potential to be profitable at a very early stage.\n\nOne of Europe's most highly valued tech start-ups, Swedish payments firm Klarna, which support merchants and competes with the likes of Paypal has shown this is possible. It turned a profit in only its second year.\n\nBACK TO BASICS\n\nDave McClure, founder of a venture capital seed fund and startup accelerator called 500 Startups in Silicon Valley, said that while 60 percent of his investments are in consumer-oriented companies, probably a bigger proportion of B2B start-ups are having greater success.\n\n\"For a lot of consumer start-ups, it's not always obvious how you are going to monetize and there is a lot of competition for eyeballs,\" he said. \"For a lot of B2Bs, as long as you are able to get the initial customer in place there is a lot of potential for making money and continuing that business.\"\n\nMessaging software firm Slack, which is just three years old, already has almost one million paid users and customers including Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and the U.S. State Department. This month, Slack raised $200 million, giving it a $3.8 billion valuation.\n\nJonathan Userovici, an analyst at Idinvest Partners in Paris, is betting other B2Bs will grab venture capital money more easily than B2Cs this year as investors seek out recurring revenue-generators.\n\nHuman resources is attracting particular interest and Zenefits, whose software automates things like stock options and vacations, raised more than $500 million in the biggest U.S. B2B funding round last year, according to PitchBook data. It ran into regulatory troubles this year, a reminder that there are still risks involved in B2B investments.\n\nAnd while B2B investments are considered more predictable than the hits-driven consumer business, the allure of consumer start-ups remains. In the past decade, the biggest consumer successes have produced far bigger returns than B2B firms.\n\nThat means not everyone is abandoning the consumer.\n\nSweden's Kinnevik, a major investor in Europe's biggest dedicated online fashion firm Zalando, is keen to keep its money in B2C investments. It just invested $65 million in Betterment which offers users automated investment advice.\n\nMcClure at 500 Startups is keeping a foot in both camps: \"I don't think we feel any less optimistic around consumers. I think we feel more optimistic about potential for B2B now that it's starting to globalize and grow and have a greater reach.\"\n\n(Additional reporting by Sven Nordenstam; Editing by Alistair Scrutton and Alexander Smith)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Tech start-ups aimed at businesses rather than consumers are win", "title": "Business money talks for wary venture funds focused on tech start-ups", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/14/Business-money-talks-wary-venture-funds-focused-tech-start-ups", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/europe-startups_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/14/Business-money-talks-wary-venture-funds-focused-tech-start-ups", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/europe-startups_2.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Tech start-ups aimed at businesses rather than consumers are win", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcee9d\"", "article_summary": "Monetization has become a really big deal,\" said Tim He, a partner at venture capital firm Northzone.\nFunds invested in B2B start-ups rose by 40 percent to $11.9 billion year-on-year to the end of March, figures from venture capital database PitchBook show.\nVenture capital funds are also seeking a clearer way to cash in their investments.\nAnd while B2B investments are considered more predictable than the hits-driven consumer business, the allure of consumer start-ups remains.\nSTOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Tech start-ups aimed at businesses rather than consumers are winning more funding from increasingly wary venture capital investors who want to see a return on their cash sooner rather than later."}
