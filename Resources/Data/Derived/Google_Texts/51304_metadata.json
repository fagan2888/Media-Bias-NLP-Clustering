The twin bombs at the finish line of the 2013 race made sure of that.\n\nBut when the field of 30,000 leaves Hopkinton on Monday morning, the world\u2019s oldest annual marathon will take the initial, tentative steps back toward its roots as a world-class sporting event first, and a cause \u2014 for fitness, for fundraising, for freedom \u2014 second.\n\n\u201cFor us, the core principle is the Boston Marathon is an international athletic event focused on competition and excellence,\u201d Tom Grilk, the executive director of the Boston Athletic Association, said last week as he prepared for the 119th edition of the race.\n\n\u201cWe start there, every time. Including last year,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat happened in 2013 was the closest and perhaps most poignant part of our history, but part of the history. The history going forward would be written by the people who come and run and watch and participate in all the ways that people do.\u201d\n\nA year after the explosions killed three people and wounded 260 more, the Boston Marathon got just what it needed: A safe race, an American victory on Patriots\u2019 Day, and a chance for runners and residents alike to rally on Boylston Street.\n\nMeb Keflezighi delivered the cathartic victory while becoming the first American man to win the race since 1983.\n\n\u201cWe overcame a big thing last year,\u201d Keflezighi said. \u201cWe can\u2019t get those people back. It can never be forgotten; it can never be normal. But we do what we can. I\u2019m delighted to be a part of something positive.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s back this year, wearing the defending champion\u2019s bib No. 1, and hoping that he can repeat his success without the emotional boost he received from the crowds in 2014.\n\nHere are some other things to look for \u2014 and one you won\u2019t see \u2014 in the race:\n\nMEB REPEAT?\n\nKeflezighi said the support of the crowd propelled him to victory last year. But without that added boost, he will have a difficult time winning again against a field that includes three Boston champions and the winners of 80 global marathons in all.\n\nKenya\u2019s Patrick Makau is the fastest in the group, having won the 2011 Berlin Marathon in 2 hours, 3 minutes, 38 seconds. Lelisa Desisa, who won the 2013 race and then donated his winner\u2019s medal to the stricken city, is one of four Ethiopians who have completed a marathon in under 2:05.\n\nBoston\u2019s 2012 winner Wesley Korir is also in the field.\n\n\u201cMay the best man and woman win,\u201d Keflezighi said. \u201cI\u2019ll give it my best shot.\u201d\n\nTHE WOMEN\u2019S TURN?\n\nKeflezighi ended one American drought by giving the United States its first men\u2019s champion since Greg Meyer in 1983. This year, Shalane Flanagan and Desiree Linden are hoping to end a U.S. slump in the women\u2019s race that stretches to 1985.\n\nFlanagan, who came in fourth in 2013, led for more than half of the race last year before finishing seventh in an American course record of 2:22:02. Linden came in 10th last year and missed out on the win in 2011 by 2 seconds.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Things to look for in Monday\u2019s Boston Marathon", "title": "Things to look for in Monday\u2019s Boston Marathon", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Things to look for in Monday\u2019s Boston Marathon", "title": "Things to look for in Monday\u2019s Boston Marathon", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/04/20/things_to_look_for_in_mondays_boston_marathon/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/boston-marathon.jpeg7-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Things to look for in Monday\u2019s Boston Marathon", "title": "Things to look for in Monday\u2019s Boston Marathon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/boston-marathon.jpeg7-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Jimmy Golen", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd773\"", "article_summary": "Topics: From the Wires, Entertainment News, NewsBOSTON (AP) \u2014 The Boston Marathon will never be just another race again.\nThis year, Shalane Flanagan and Desiree Linden are hoping to end a U.S. slump in the women\u2019s race that stretches to 1985.\n\u201cFor us, the core principle is the Boston Marathon is an international athletic event focused on competition and excellence,\u201d Tom Grilk, the executive director of the Boston Athletic Association, said last week as he prepared for the 119th edition of the race.\n\u201cMay the best man and woman win,\u201d Keflezighi said.\nHere are some other things to look for \u2014 and one you won\u2019t see \u2014 in the race:MEB REPEAT?"}
