Texas is home to the nation’s highest percentage of uninsured residents. Former Gov. Rick Perry and the Republican-led Legislature rejected expansion of Medicaid coverage and sued the federal government in 2010 over the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare. Despite state leaders’ heated rhetoric and predictions of imminent calamity, Obamacare is now fully implemented, putting a dent in Texas’ whopping uninsured rate. But states that accepted Medicaid expansion, unlike Texas, have seen the biggest gains. Recent statistics show that Texas still has a long way to go before we relinquish our status as No. 1 in the ranks of the nation’s uninsured.
