Credit: Journal Sentinel files\n\nThe Wisconsin Voter The Journal Sentinel's Craig Gilbert explores political trends in a purple state and beyond. SHARE\n\nBy of the\n\nAshland, New Hampshire \u2014 Scott Walker and Ohio\u2019s John Kasich are conservative, Midwestern, swing-state governors who got elected in 2010, fought with organized labor, got reelected in 2014, and are running for president in 2016.\n\nYou might think it would be hard to tell their campaigns apart.\n\nIt isn\u2019t.\n\nIn fact, all those similarities just make their differences more compelling. And they make Kasich a handy reference point when taking stock of Walker\u2019s presidential bid, which is struggling right now.\n\nThe two Great Lakes governors are running for president with different messages, different rhetoric, different stories about their time in office and different strategies.\n\nWalker is trying to excite grass roots conservatives without alienating the party\u2019s more pragmatic wing.\n\nKasich is trying to capture independents and centrist Republicans without alienating the conservative base.\n\nWalker is running as a winner and warrior, Kasich as a fixer and uniter.\n\nWalker says the party can win without compromise. Kasich says nothing big gets done without Republicans and Democrats finding some common ground.\n\nWalker has an Iowa-first strategy in the primaries and caucuses. Kasich has a New Hampshire-first strategy.\n\nWalker burst out of the gate in January but lost momentum this summer and has hit the doldrums in August.\n\nKasich started so late he was dismissed as a long shot but gained traction this month after the first GOP debate.\n\nWalker combines a lightning-rod record and hard-line rhetoric with a personality so low-key he jokes that his wife thinks he\u2019s boring.\n\nKasich\u2019s rhetoric is more conciliatory, but his style is more impassioned as well as more abrasive.\n\nIt\u2019s not that there\u2019s a vast political gulf between the two. Both consider themselves conservatives and have conservative political histories. But Walker has shaded to the right in this campaign, Kasich to the center. Their policy differences include immigration and Common Core. Kasich expanded Medicaid in Ohio under Obamacare, while Walker refused the added federal money to do so in Wisconsin.\n\nBut their differences go beyond issues to style, strategy, the language they use and the signals they send.\n\nWalker\u2019s political message to conservatives is that they can have it all -- they can win elections and govern on their own terms. They don\u2019t have to choose between values and electability, and they don\u2019t have to cut deals when they\u2019re in power.\n\n\u201cIf that\u2019s what you want out of the next president, someone who\u2019s not just going to fight, but someone who can fight and win ...and actually get results without compromising ... that\u2019s the candidate I am,\u201d Walker told a crowd of 200 at the American Legion Hall in Ashland, New Hampshire Thursday night.\n\nKasich\u2019s message to his party about governing is very different.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t do it by just Republicans jamming their stuff through because that becomes like Obamacare,\u201d he said at a town hall meeting in Salem, New Hampshire, Wednesday.\n\nIf someone is promising to make all your conservative dreams come true, Kasich told his audience, don\u2019t believe it.\n\n\u201cWe can pound our fists and say, \u2018We\u2019re going to do this, this and this!\u2019\u201d said Kasich.\n\n\u201cEver wonder why people when they run for president, they don\u2019t keep their promises? Because they make promises that can\u2019t be kept. I\u2019m a conservative with conservative principles, but you just can\u2019t do it alone.\u201d\n\nThey have different stories to tell about their own records. Walker\u2019s story is that he fought and won as governor \u201cfor hardworking taxpayers.\u201d Kasich\u2019s story is that he didn\u2019t leave anyone behind. \u201cWe can\u2019t turn our backs on poor people. I don\u2019t do that in my state,\u201d he said in Salem.\n\nKasich brags about the breadth of his 2014 re-election victory (against a weak Democratic opponent). He won 69% of independents in Ohio, 59% of moderates, 53% of union households, 26% of the black vote and 25% of Democrats, according to exit polls.\n\n\u201cThe state is unified,\u201d he declared at the Aug. 6 GOP debate.\n\nWalker brags about winning almost universal support in his own party (96% of the GOP vote in Wisconsin in 2014). And while he also brags about winning independents by double-digits, he says he did it without moderating his views. Independents don\u2019t want someone with middle-of-the-road positions, he tells his audiences, they want someone who won\u2019t waver.\n\nWalker\u2019s re-election victory in Wisconsin was far more polarizing than Kasich\u2019s in Ohio. He won 46% of moderates, 34% of union households and just 6% of Democrats. And Walker\u2019s home-state approval rating is lower than Kasich\u2019s (39% in the Marquette University Law school poll released Thursday). But for GOP primary voters, Walker has a longer and purer checklist of conservative policies to brag about.\n\nHow are these differences playing out for each candidate?\n\nKasich appears to have momentum in New Hampshire and could be a serious contender if he can begin to consolidate independents and moderate GOP voters.\n\nHis style \u2013 more unscripted and emotional than Walker\u2019s \u2013 served him well in the first debate. But it can be prickly and confrontational, too, and hasn\u2019t always been an asset in the past.\n\nThe biggest question he may face is whether party conservatives in the end would find him to be an acceptable nominee on their issues.\n\nWalker\u2019s demeanor (a campaign adviser calls it \u2018Midwestern nice\u2019) was supposed to be a reassuring asset. But he has come across as either scripted or bland to many Republicans, and tried last week in New Hampshire to show more passion and engage more with voters.\n\nWalker\u2019s determination to capture conservative hearts and minds makes political sense, since it plays to his strengths and it\u2019s where the energy in the party is. But it has also gotten him into trouble, creating confusion over his rightward shifts on immigration and raising doubts among some establishment Republicans.\n\nThe latest example: Walker made supportive comments last Monday about ending birthright citizenship, a controversial, hard-line immigration stand that Donald Trump has taken and a few other Republicans in the field have echoed.\n\nBut his position remained murky for days, and Friday Walker told CNBC interviewer John Harwood that he had no stand on the issue.\n\n\"I'm not taking a position on it one way or the other,\" said Walker, who said Sunday on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d he was not seeking to change the Constitution to end birthright citizenship.\n\nKasich and Walker are both living right now in Trump\u2019s shadow, as is the rest of the GOP field.\n\nBut as both a staunch conservative and a career politician, Walker faces a particular political risk: Will he be squeezed out by candidates who are either more moderate (Kasich), more right-wing (Ted Cruz), more \u201cinside\u201d (Jeb Bush), more \u201coutside,\u201d (Ben Carson, Carly Fiorina), or more flamboyant (Trump)?\n\nFollow Craig Gilbert on Twitter @WisVoter", "article_metadata": {"title": "Two Midwest GOP governors with very different presidential campaigns", "og": {"url": "http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/news/322630701.html", "image": {"width": 660, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/walkerkasich.jpg", "height": 441}, "type": "article", "description": "Their similarities make their differences more compelling, and make Ohio's John Kasich a handy reference point when taking stock of Scott Walker\u2019s presidential bid.", "title": "2 Midwest GOP governors, very different presidential campaigns"}, "twitter": {"site": "@journalsentinel", "image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/walkerkasich.jpg", "description": "Their similarities make their differences more compelling, and make Ohio's John Kasich a handy reference point when taking stock of Scott Walker\u2019s presidential bid.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Two Midwest GOP governors with very different presidential campaigns"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"admins": "journal.sentinel.1", "app_id": 227386193957280}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-mjs-144-icon.png", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The two Great Lakes governors are running for president with different messages, different rhetoric, different stories about their time in office and different strategies.\nIndependents don\u2019t want someone with middle-of-the-road positions, he tells his audiences, they want someone who won\u2019t waver.\nI\u2019m a conservative with conservative principles, but you just can\u2019t do it alone.\u201dThey have different stories to tell about their own records.\nKasich and Walker are both living right now in Trump\u2019s shadow, as is the rest of the GOP field.\nBoth consider themselves conservatives and have conservative political histories."}
