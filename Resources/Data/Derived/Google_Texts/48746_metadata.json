Later, however, Dorian insists that his artificially-designed emotions are as real as any human\u2019s. \u201cI was made to feel,\u201d he tells the detective.\n\nIf the former is true, then it is likely that, throughout the course of the show, Dorian will struggle to understand certain intricacies and nuances of human behavior \u2014 specifically those that go against his presumably methodical and logical programming. If the latter is true, expect Dorian to experience difficulty in making sense of his own emotions as one newly born into an adult form. If any of it sounds familiar, that\u2019s because we\u2019ve seen it before. Wikipedia defines an android thusly: \u201ca robot or synthetic organism designed to look and act like a human, especially one with a body having a flesh-like resemblance. Until recently, androids have largely remained within the domain of science fiction, frequently seen in film and television.\u201d The android, aside from being a very cool idea with a myriad of narrative possibilities, is a device frequently used by sci-fi storytellers to hold human behavior and emotion under a microscope.\n\nZack Stentz is the screenwriter behind such successful Hollywood blockbusters as \u201cThor\u201d and \u201cX-Men: First Class.\u201d He also served as a writer and producer on \u201cFringe\u201d and \u201cThe Sarah Connor Chronicles,\u201d which featured Summer Glau as the latest in the line of killer machines that began with James Cameron\u2019s iconic Terminator android. Via email, Stentz told me the following:\n\nI think there are several different ways to use an android character to explore what it\u2019s like to be human. Traditionally, Gene Roddenberry liked to use his android characters, both in the original series but particularly \u2018The Next Generation\u2019s\u2019 Commander Data, to explore the human condition by having them as outsider characters looking in on the world of emotion and irrationality with curiosity and sometimes envy. There\u2019s a marked tendency in science fiction television to use android characters as Pinocchio figures \u2014 they all seem to want to become \u2018real boys\u2019 despite usually being stronger, faster, and smarter than the humans they envy.\n\nPersonally, I\u2019m partial to Marvin the Paranoid Android from the BBC\u2019s hilarious, low-budget adaptation of Douglas Adams\u2019 \u201cHitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy.\u201d The clunky service bot\u2019s cynical take on man\u2019s nihilism is both infinitely quotable and increasingly relatable in today\u2019s over-stimulated, never-satisfied society. (Marvin was also the funniest, best-devised contrast to another iconic android \u2014 George Lucas\u2019 annoyingly upbeat, eager-to-please C3P0.) Hell, you could probably find traces of what Stentz is talking about in \u201cSmall Wonder\u2019s\u201d Vicki the Robot. But \u201cStar Trek: TNG\u2019s\u201d green-tinged Lieutenant Commander Data is, by far, the most well known synthetic human on the small screen to ever puzzle over what makes people sad or why we have sex for pleasure.\n\nData was, as Stentz points out, stronger, more agile, and arguably more intelligent than his counterparts in Starfleet. Nevertheless, his lack of social intelligence continued to be a source of embarrassment to him. Though man-made, Data was described as \u201csentient,\u201d which allowed the writers of that show to explore the deepest notions of what it means to be self-aware. Defining sentience and establishing its implicit rights are common themes in such android-heavy films as \u201cI, Robot\u201d and \u201cBlade Runner\u201d \u2014 which is, of course, loosely based on Philip K. Dick\u2019s short story, \u201cDo Androids Dream of Electric Sleep?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hyperintelligent robots like \"Almost Human's\" Dorian let us look at humanity from the outside", "title": "Why we love androids on TV", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Hyperintelligent robots like \"Almost Human's\" Dorian let us look at humanity from the outside", "title": "Why we love androids on TV", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/11/17/why_we_love_androids_on_tv/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/11/almost_human.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Hyperintelligent robots like \"Almost Human's\" Dorian let us look at humanity from the outside", "title": "Why we love androids on TV", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/11/almost_human.jpg", "creator": "@Neil_Salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Neil Drumming", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, almost human, androids, androids on tv, Editor's Picks", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd3b5\"", "article_summary": "Topics: almost human, androids, androids on tv, Editor's Picks, Entertainment NewsThere\u2019s a scene in the pilot episode of FOX\u2019s \u201cAlmost Human\u201d where Dorian, a DRN model police android, approximates human behavior by awkwardly injecting the word \u201cman\u201d into his speech patterns.\nThere\u2019s a marked tendency in science fiction television to use android characters as Pinocchio figures \u2014 they all seem to want to become \u2018real boys\u2019 despite usually being stronger, faster, and smarter than the humans they envy.\nData was, as Stentz points out, stronger, more agile, and arguably more intelligent than his counterparts in Starfleet.\nHell, you could probably find traces of what Stentz is talking about in \u201cSmall Wonder\u2019s\u201d Vicki the Robot.\nLater, however, Dorian insists that his artificially-designed emotions are as real as any human\u2019s."}
