The man sitting atop the Republican field in the U.S.\u2014Donald Trump\u2014wants to repeal Obamacare and get (even more) Wall Street types running the economy.\n\nAnd, oh yes, keep out the Mexicans.\n\nPolitically\u2014and that\u2019s just for openers\u2014the two couldn\u2019t be further apart. Yet Corbyn and Trump could conceivably find a way to enjoy each other\u2019s company\u2014perhaps over a few pints\u2014swapping stories about the havoc they\u2019re creating within the Labour and Republican parties.\n\nBecause for all their differences, both have succeeded in turning their parties against themselves. Which doesn\u2019t seem like an easy thing to do and could bode poorly for victory at the polls, should either of them actually make it that far.\n\nJeremy Corbyn speaks to supporters at a Labour party leadership rally on August 3, 2015 in London. Photographer: Carl Court/Getty Images\n\nAt least Labour has five years to try and sort themselves out against the Conservatives, no matter who ends up succeeding Ed Miliband as party leader in September: Corbyn, Yvette Cooper, Andy Burnham or Liz Kendall.\n\nSince Tony Blair suggested last month that party faithful whose hearts are with Corbyn should \u201cget a transplant,\u201d his support has only grown. With the former prime minister a shrunken figure compared with his years leading \u201cCool Britannia,\u201d could he have received a better endorsement?\n\nA sign was a rally held by Corbyn in Camden on Monday. With some 1,500 supporters present\u2014the biggest turnout yet for the left-wing MP\u2014he was forced to address his fans in four separate venues.\n\nClearly, not everyone was buying Shadow Chancellor Chris Leslie\u2019s warning that Corbyn\u2019s \u201cstarry-eyed, hard-left\u201d economic policies mean at least another decade in power for the Tories. And by the way, Leslie says he wouldn\u2019t serve on the frontbench team\u2014along with at least seven other shadow ministers\u2014should Corbyn win. So much for party unity.\n\nMeanwhile, with some 16 or so Republican candidates\u2014excluding a bunch that few people have heard of\u2014gunning for Trump, the GOP could be in a bigger mess with the election less than a year and a half away.\n\nWhile calling McCain a phony last month may have sparked outrage across much of the party\u2014including candidates Jeb Bush, Rick Perry and Lindsey Graham \u2014it hasn\u2019t hurt Trump\u2019s support.\n\nNow his rivals are wondering how to take him on\u2014and take him down a peg or two\u2014in Thursday\u2019s debate in Cleveland. In truth, their strategies don\u2019t seem all that convincing. Time will tell, soon enough. And the infighting continues.\n\nGetting back to those beers. What about in 2020 at Downing Street North in Islington, or maybe the Trump White House & Casino in Atlantic City, Prime Minister Corbyn and President Trump.
