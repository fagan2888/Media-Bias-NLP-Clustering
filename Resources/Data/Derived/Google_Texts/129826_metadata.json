(WOLO) \u2014 The deadline to file taxes is Monday at midnight and ABC Columbia spoke with tax experts to find out what you need to know before the clock strikes midnight.\n\nFor those seeking to file on-time, experts say the easiest and most time efficient way is electronically.\n\n\u201cThe trend has normally been about 85% of taxpayers file electronically within the first 4 months of the filing season,\u201d explained Bonnie Swingle, South Carolina Department of Revenue.\n\nHowever, for those last minute taxpayers who may not meet the deadline, there is the option to request more time.\n\n\u201cIn some cases, they don\u2019t have all their paperwork, a lot of people have not been able to file because they don\u2019t have the necessary forms for the Affordable Care Act,\u201d explained Larry Moody, H&R Block. \u201cSometimes they haven\u2019t been able to get certain documents and certain times they wait until the last minute and they don\u2019t have anything that they need to file so they ask for an extension.\u201d\n\nThe request for an extension gives you until October 15th, but there is one catch.\n\n\u201cThe extension is for time to file, not for time to pay so if a taxpayer still owes money, they still need to pay it today,\u201d said Swingle.\n\nAccording to the SC Department of Revenue, more than 120,000 taxpayers filed for an extension on their 2014 returns, which is a better option than facing the penalty you pay for filing late.\n\n\u201cThere is a penalty based on the amount of money that you owe as well as a flat fee for not filing,\u201d said Moody.\n\nTo file for an extension, you can visit www.dor.sc.gov.", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "og": {"site_name": "ABC Columbia", "description": "Columbia , S.C.
