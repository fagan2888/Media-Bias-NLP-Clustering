After a nervous, sleepless night in Paris, Andy Murray overcame Germany's Philipp Kohlschreiber in five sets to move to the fourth round of the French Open.

The Wimbledon champion from Britain beat Germany's Kohlschreiber, 3-6, 6-3, 6-3, 4-6, 12-10 on the Court Suzanne Lenglen at Roland Garros in Paris.

Their match had been suspended last night at 9:39 pm local time in Paris at 7-7 in the final set because of darkness. The seventh-seeded Murray had been up a break in each of the five sets against the 30-year-old.

"Both of us came out here pretty nervous," Murray said in a court-side interview. "But I think it was a pretty high standard. I didn't sleep much, and woke up a few times. I was ready to play at 4 or 5 in the morning." He added he'd only had about five hours' sleep in total.

Murray set up a match point with a forehand passing shot off a net cord as he led 9-8, only for Kohlschreiber to save it with a smash.

Murray then saved a break point at 9-9 with a service winner as the crowd loudly cheered "Philipp, Philipp."

With Kohlschreiber serving to stay in the match at 11-10 down, Murray converted his second match point with a backhand return winner.

Murray, 27, hasn't won a tournament since he became the first man from the British Isles to clinch the Wimbledon singles title in 77 years.

He missed four months of the season after undergoing back surgery in September.

The Scotland-born player is currently without a coach after his cooperation with eight-time major champion Ivan Lendl ended in March.
