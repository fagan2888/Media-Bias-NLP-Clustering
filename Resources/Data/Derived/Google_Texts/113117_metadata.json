Average Indians pay zero percent of the costs of physician office visits, preventive services and outpatient services.\n\nObamacare also includes a number of other Indian-only benefits.\n\n\u201cMembers of American Indian and Alaska Native Tribes are exempt from individual responsibility assessments,\u201d the document states, referring to Obamacare\u2019s individual mandate penalty.\n\nIndians who qualify for health care from the federal Indian Health Service get the exemption without having to provide documented proof of their Indian blood.\n\n\u201cOur responsibility to provide health services to American Indians and Alaska Natives derives from the nation-to-nation relationship between the federal and tribal governments,\u201d President Obama said in 2010.\n\nObama attended a January 2012 fundraiser with 70 Indian leaders, including Oneida Indian Nation Representative Ray Halbritter, the activist currently spearheading the campaign to change the name of the Washington Redskins. The event raised up to $2.5 million for his re-election efforts.\n\nHalbritter, who is not a legitimate member of his own tribe according to geneological documents and a New York state assemblywoman, said that Obama is doing more to communicate with Indian country than any president in his experience.\n\nThe White House did not return a request for comment.\n\n(h/t Dave Petno)\n\nFollow Patrick on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Patrick Howley", "description": "American Indians do not have to pay co-pays or deductibles with their Obamacare insurance plans if they make less than 300 percent of the poverty level", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "American Indians do not have to pay co-pays or deductibles with their Obamacare insurance plans if they make less than 300 percent of the poverty level, and many don't have to provide any documentatio", "title": "Average American Indian has no co-pays under Obamacare", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2013/10/17/average-american-indian-has-no-co-pays-under-obamacare/", "image": {"width": 630, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/04940878c07e43e28ab9f3aec39b52b5-e1376113749787-1.jpg", "height": 271}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Free ride for those of tribal ancestry", "title": "Average American Indian has no co-pays under Obamacare Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2013/10/17/average-american-indian-has-no-co-pays-under-obamacare/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/04940878c07e43e28ab9f3aec39b52b5-e1376113749787-1.jpg"}, "creator": "@patrickhowleydc", "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-10-17 12:42:08", "sailthru.title": "Average American Indian has no co-pays under Obamacare", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "obamacare,patrick-howley", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "obamacare,native americans,indians", "sailthru.description": "American Indians do not have to pay co-pays or deductibles with their Obamacare insurance plans if they make less than 300 percent of the poverty level, and many don't have to provide any documentatio", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/04940878c07e43e28ab9f3aec39b52b5-e1376113749787-1.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1749\"", "article_summary": "Average Indians pay zero percent of the costs of physician office visits, preventive services and outpatient services.\nIndians making less than 300 percent of the poverty level pay no deductible or out-of-pocket expenses and have a maximum out-of-pocket expense of $0 in Obamacare insurance plans.\n\u201cOur responsibility to provide health services to American Indians and Alaska Natives derives from the nation-to-nation relationship between the federal and tribal governments,\u201d President Obama said in 2010.\nIndians who qualify for health care from the federal Indian Health Service get the exemption without having to provide documented proof of their Indian blood.\n\u201cMembers of American Indian and Alaska Native Tribes are exempt from individual responsibility assessments,\u201d the document states, referring to Obamacare\u2019s individual mandate penalty."}
