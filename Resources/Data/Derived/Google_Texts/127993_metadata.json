This is the third straight year since the cap was instituted in 2011 that spending ended the year below the projected spending levels.\n\nMedicaid spending finished $39 million under the $16.421 billion cap, though an additional $75 million in savings under the cap was already used in this year\u2019s final budget agreement to pre-pay expenses in the current year (SFY 2014-2015), for a total of $114 million in savings under the cap in SFY 2013-2014.\n\nThe $114 million in total savings is a result of:\n\nlower utilization of services ($108 million savings);\n\nlower state operations costs ($50 million savings);\n\nhigher savings associated with the state takeover of local Medicaid administration ($11 million savings); offset by\n\nlower than expected enhanced federal Medicaid matching funds associated with the Affordable Care Act (-$55 million).\n\nMedicaid enrollment reached a total of 5,697,529 at the end of the fiscal year, representing a net enrollment increase of 446,451, including 494,000 people who signed up for Medicaid through the New York State of Health marketplace.\n\nThe Medicaid global cap for the current year (SFY 2014-2015) is $16.96 billion. This year\u2019s final budget included changes to the global cap, including a global cap \u201cdividend\u201d to share savings with providers and plans if spending finishes below the global cap levels; and additional detail in the monthly global cap reports, including more information on price, utilization, projected enrollment changes, and other initiatives, with a description of the current and future year impact on a variety of categories of spending. Similar to this past year\u2019s adopted budget, a portion of the savings anticipated to accrue this year is expected to be used for state financial plan relief.
