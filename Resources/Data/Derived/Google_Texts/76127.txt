NEW ORLEANS (AP) — Robert Durst, a wealthy and eccentric heir to a New York real estate fortune, has been arrested for murder just before the airing of a six-part documentary about his links to two killings and the disappearance of his wife.

Durst’s defense lawyer said Sunday that the FBI arrested him at a Marriott hotel in New Orleans on a Los Angeles warrant for the murder of Susan Berman 15 years ago.

Durst, 71, has never been charged in connection with the 1982 disappearance of his wife, Kathie, or in the unsolved 2000 murder of Susan Berman, in Beverly Hills, California. He was acquitted in the 2001 dismemberment death of his Galveston neighbor, Morris Black, because he said the killing was in self-defense.

Durst has always denied involvement in his wife’s disappearance or Berman’s murder.

Defense lawyer Chip Lewis, who successfully defended Durst in the 2001 dismemberment death of his Galveston neighbor, said he will waive extradition and be transported to Los Angeles to face the charges.

The arrest came on the eve of Sunday’s broadcast on HBO of the first episode of a six-part documentary, “The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst,” by filmmaker Andrew Jarecki.
