Lee speaking to the crowd at the Freedom Forum, St. George, Utah, Sept. 6, 2013 | Photo by Mori Kessler, St. George News\n\nST. GEORGE \u2013 U.S. Sen. Mike Lee spoke to a packed house Friday night at the inaugural Freedom Forum, held at the Gardner Center on the Dixie State University campus. He addressed a myriad of topics related to the need for the American people to stand together and assert their constitutional rights before the government gradually takes those rights away.\n\nBefore speaking at the forum, sponsored by the Washington County Republican Party, Lee visited with students of George Washington Academy and members of the Teenage Republicans.\n\nGeorge Washington Academy\n\nOn Thursday, students in grades 5-8 at the George Washington Academy charter school in St. George held their student elections. The following day, Lee visited a school assembly and answered questions about the electoral process. He also spoke to students about the Constitution and posed for photos with the student election winners.\n\nTeenage Republicans\n\nBefore addressing a packed house in the Gardner Center, Lee spent time with members of the Teenage Republicans from around the county.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re getting involved early,\u201d Lee said.\n\nLee told the youth that the Affordable Healthcare Act needs to be stopped and he is doing what he can in Washington, D.C. to achieve that end. \u201cWe can\u2019t let that law take effect,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also took questions on the Second Amendment and U.S. military action against Syria. Lee said he and other senators, namely Rand Paul of Kentucky and Ted Cruz of Texas, are ardent supporters of the right to bear arms (or arm bears?) and will continue to fight against federal gun control measures.\n\nAs for Syria, Lee said that his office has received around 1,500 calls on the matter alone, and the overwhelming majority were against the U.S. stepping in.\n\nFreedom Forum\n\nLee served as guest speaker at the first in a series of public events called the \u201cFreedom Forums.\u201d Nick Lang, chair of the county Republican party, said upcoming speakers will include Rep. Chris Stewart and Gov. Gary Herbert.\n\nLee began his remarks by sharing stories related to his being one of Utah\u2019s youngest senators, age 39 at the time of his election in 2010. He said there have been numerous times he was not recognized by congressional security as a senator at first. Instead, they mistook him for a staff member due to his age.\n\nOne of things that he hadn\u2019t been doing, Lee said, was wearing a special lapel pin on his suit that notified security staff he was indeed a senator. He referred to the pin as his \u201cSorry, Senator\u201d pin, for the reaction he repeatedly gets from security when he has to point it out.\n\nLee said he had to assert his position as a senator, something which he was not comfortable with at first. He then tied that story into the theme of his speech: People needing to be willing to stand up and assert their constitutional rights and freedoms.\n\nIf we fail to assert our rights, Lee said, then we will lose them to people who will assert those rights out of existence.\n\nLee pulled out a worn pocket-size copy of the Constitution that he said some people in the nation\u2019s capitol make fun of him for carrying. They tell him the Constitution is quaint and outdated: it was made for an agrarian society; a product of yesterday that no longer adequately applies to the modern age.\n\n\u201cA lot of our important laws are old,\u201d Lee said, adding that the older the law, the better and simpler it is. \u201cGet over it.\u201d\n\nThere are two things that help build the country and keep it strong, Lee said, and government has little to do with either.\n\nThe first contains what he referred to as \u201cthe robust institutions of civil society.\u201d This includes churches, charities, volunteer institutions, businesses, families and hardworking individuals. The second is a free market, void of excessive government regulation and interference.\n\n\u201cThrough these we see the needs of the people taken care of without government interference,\u201d Lee said. Government can\u2019t create the institutions of civil society, he said, but it can easily obliterate them. \u201cOnce they are destroyed, we cannot easily get them back,\u201d he said.\n\nLee also spoke of wanting to gradually cut spending to government programs as a way to lower the national deficit over sudden and severe \u201cdraconian cuts\u201d that would hurt many people, particularly the poor.\n\nAs he closed his remarks, Lee invited his audience to join him in asserting their constitutional rights, so Congress cannot not take them away through continual power grabs. Whenever government gets involved in something, especially when it involves the \u201crobust institutions of civil society,\u201d government only makes things worse, no matter which party spearheads it, Lee said.\n\nReaction\n\nWhile Lee received a standing ovation and cheers at the close of his speech, not everyone present was impressed. A small contingency from the Washington County Democratic Party also attended the forum and one of them, Robert Maloney, said he appreciated Lee visiting Southern Utah yet was not exactly inspired by the senator\u2019s words.\n\n\u201cI felt he was being unfair talking about cutting the Affordable Care Act without putting anything forward that would be an alternative,\u201d Maloney said. (Though Lee did not mention the act by name during his speech, he did say there should be a gradual cutback on government-funded social programs.)\n\nMaloney, who described himself as a member of a minority, also said he was disappointed he saw so few minorities represented in the audience. \u201c(Lee) is a senator for the whole state and (the organizers) didn\u2019t do a good job of getting minorities here tonight,\u201d he said.\n\nConversely, Zac Stucki, who did not identify a party affiliation, liked what he heard.\n\n\u201cHe said a lot of things I was feeling but I think we sometimes feel like we can\u2019t say,\u201d Stucki said. \u201cIt\u2019s our job to say these things or else nothing is going to change.\u201d\n\nRelated posts\n\nEmail: mkessler@stgnews.com\n\nTwitter: @MoriKessler\n\nCopyright St. George News, SaintGeorgeUtah.com LLC, 2013, all rights reserved.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://www.stgeorgeutah.com/wp-content/themes/st_george_utah_2015/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileColor": "#da532c", "description": "ST.
