Other countries, including gas-rich Malaysia, have promised to act on climate.\n\nNo one should presume things will be easy in Lima, Peru, where negotiators are gathering through next week to shape a global climate agreement that could be finalized in Paris a year from now. There\u2019s strong \u2014 and to a large extent justified \u2014 resistance to new carbon commitments in India, for example, where hundreds of millions of people lack access to any modern energy sources, let alone clean ones. And there will be intensifying demands for billions to flow from industrialized countries that spent decades building wealth burning fossil fuels to poor, vulnerable ones. Given continuing economic troubles in many developed countries, those demands will be hard to meet.\n\nStill, there are plenty of signs that there\u2019s room for a global accord to emerge, with every faction \u2014 from the poorest to the richest \u2014 finding a comfort zone thanks to the 24-year-old clause in the original climate treaty laying out nations\u2019 \u201ccommon but differentiated responsibilities\u201d (here\u2019s a great explainer from McGill\u2019s Center for International Sustainable Development Law).\n\nAs long ago as 1991, there were calls to pursue \u201csoft,\u201d not internationally binding, steps toward a global climate treaty. Read these notes from a fascinating 1991 Harvard meeting on Negotiating a Global Climate Agreement to get the idea. (There are some excerpts below. I first wrote about that meeting in 2010.)\n\nTalks are progressing now because this shift is in fact occurring.\n\nJohn Upton has an informative piece on Climate Central that lays out the logic of non-binding success and also why some parties, particularly Europe, still resist:\n\nAs negotiators gather in Peru for a critical round of climate talks, U.S. delegates are straining to explain what they call a \u201ccounterintuitive\u201d reality: For next year\u2019s global climate agreement to be effective, commitments made under it must not be legally binding. Such an outcome would disappoint many, including the European Union\u2019s negotiating team, which says it will be pushing for binding commitments during the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change talks in Lima this week and next. America\u2019s negotiators are pushing for voluntary commitments. The success of the next climate agreement, which is due to be finalized during talks in Paris one year from now, may hinge on American negotiators winning in this latest spat in a long-simmering quarrel with their European counterparts.\n\nIt\u2019s a pretty good bet that Europe will \u2014 excuse the term \u2014 soften, given the momentum built by the year-long process that produced the American announcement with China and particularly because failure in the heart of Europe is unimaginable.\n\nThe new emphasis on a soft approach is quite a contrast to the tone in the run-up to the tumultuous Copenhagen talks in 2009, when inflated \u201cseal the deal\u201d expectations \u2014 partially driven by the election of President Obama \u2014 led to the idea there could be new international, legally-binding gas limits like those tried in the 1997 Kyoto Protocol \u2014 which has proved a dead-end document.\n\nYvo de Boer, who held the chair in the climate talks through Copenhagen and now runs the Global Green Growth Institute, made the point this way in an interview with Bloomberg\u2019s The Grid back in June:\n\nQ: Is it still realistic for climate negotiators to want an \u201cinternational, legally binding\u201d treaty? Was it ever realistic if the U.S. always opposed one? A: If a country enters into a legally-binding commitment and they back away from it, what do you do? Arrest the prime minister? \u201cNationally legally-binding\u201d is much stronger. I think we\u2019ve moved beyond Kyoto-style agreements. Hopefully in Paris we will see countries make ambitious pledges to limit or reduce emissions. [Read the rest.]\n\nDebates will (and should) continue over how much of what\u2019s being pledged is simply enshrining energy and pollution trends (both in the United States and countries like China) that are already being driven by other factors (cheap shale gas and growing energy efficiency here, smog concerns in China, etc.).\n\nAnd much of what is being pledged, despite Yvo de Boer\u2019s hope for legally-binding actions at the national level, is still much more like putty than steel, as Jack Goldsmith of Harvard Law School noted (in the context of United States law) on his Lawfare blog earlier this year.\n\nBut momentum matters, as does the rising trust among parties as they split from a faction-against-faction approach (remember the Group of 77 plus China bloc?) to finding common threads, one on one.\n\nThe summary of that 1991 meeting on climate agreements, written by Henry Lee, who\u2019s still at Harvard, have some relevant sections, including this one:\n\nPerhaps the real problem is not agreeing on a treaty, but building nations\u2019 confidence in other nations\u2019 capacity and willingness to cut emissions. We are skeptical about whether Brazil will do it, and they are skeptical about us. And as in the recent U.S.-Japan decisions over Structural Impediments to trade, if we both can do it, we will both be better off. Overcoming this blockage will either take an adjustment of our notion of sovereignty where implementation is concerned, or a focus on unilateral action. U.S. unilateral action could set an example for the world, and help to structure the international process so as to increase confidence. If the U.S., for example, significantly increased transportation fuel prices, then this action would both increase our influence in pushing for good international deals, and exempt us from charges of obstruction when we refuse to sign a bad one. There is a lot of latent cooperativeness, looking for a structure in which to express itself. This is what international legal measures, soft or hard, should do \u2014 give an enabling structure to this latent willingness to help.\n\nObama has moved far more on power plants and auto efficiency than fuel prices (which are headed down of course), which simply shows that expectations and options evolve over time. But his administration\u2019s domestic power plant rules and simultaneous interaction with China reflect how this dynamic can work.\n\nThere\u2019s much more at the Harvard Project on Climate Agreements, including this new paper: \u201cA Pre-Lima Scorecard for Evaluating which Countries are Doing Their Fair Share in Pledged Carbon Cuts.\u201d\n\nUpdate, Dec. 6, 8:45 a.m. | Professor Lee at Harvard sent this illuminating note after I\u2019d posted:\n\nThe real architects of the soft strategy were Abe Chayes [bio] and Tom Schelling [Nobelist in Economics] and it is fascinating that it has taken 23 years for the world to finally catch up. Although Chayes\u2019s thumbprint is all over the Rio treaty of 1992. Howard Raiffa convened a bi-weekly seminar at the Business School in which both Tom and Abe participated, and it was out of these discussions that the soft strategy emerged. While I firmly believe it to be the only workable strategy that can result in meaningful progress, skeptics ask \u2013will this strategy be enough to make a measurable difference in slowing the build up of greenhouse gas concentrations? Given the domestic hurdles facing Obama, the inability to raise significant funds for the Green Climate Fund and China\u2019s long farewell to its growth in carbon emissions, we may still be another decade away from seeing this issue turn around. This is not to say that the Xi-Obama agreement or a successful Paris protocol will not be significant, but the question is \u2013will it be enough.\n\nI replied this way (email shorthand cleaned up):\n\nThe \u201cWill it be enough?\u201d question leads to \u201cWhat is enough?\u201d I\u2019ve always liked John Holdren\u2019s notion that there\u2019s a sliding mix of \u201cmitigation, adaptation and suffering.\u201d No hard lines going forward. And the learn-and-adjust aspect of humanity\u2019s complex response will keep tweaking the two knobs as necessary.\n\nIt will be far from perfect, or rational. But we\u2019ll keep moving on. The human way.\n\nUpdate, Dec. 6, 11:45 a.m. | Robert Stavins, another Harvard economist focused on climate policy, sent the following observation:\n\nYou mention something that is very important to keep in mind, but frequently ignored in press and other commentary on the ongoing international climate negotiations, namely: \u201cNo hard lines going forward.\u201d There is not some distinct bend in the marginal damage function or marginal cost function at 450 ppm [a carbon dioxide concentration of 450 parts per million]. In other words, it\u2019s fair to say that stabilizing at 350 ppm means less damages, and stabilizing at 550 ppm means more damages (things get more complicated when bringing in marginal costs, and searching for the most dynamically efficient path forward), but there is really not something magical about 450 ppm. The 450 ppm target is a political goal (which is important), but is not linked in some rigorous way with the science and economics. It has also become fundamentally infeasible, as the this year\u2019s IPCC AR5 WG3 and SYR reports have illustrated quite clearly. Unfortunately, pointing this out has become politically incorrect and controversial.\n\nI was also remiss in not including a link to his excellent blog post explaining the significance of the Lima meeting and why recent steps are important.
