Meanwhile, the level of workers who are part time because they can\u2019t find full-time work is actually higher now than it was before the recession.\n\nSecond, the level of involuntary part-timers has declined sharply for workers in goods-producing industries such as manufacturing and construction. Industries that typically rely on a larger part-time workforce, such as the retail and hospitality sectors, have seen little improvement.\n\nAlso, the share of part-time workers who are finding full-time work one year later is low historically across both the goods-producing and the service sector, but it has shown more improvement for goods than for services, according to data compiled by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.\n\nIf this is a structural change, what\u2019s behind it? One potential culprit that comes up often in this discussion is the Affordable Care Act, which requires employers with 50 or more full-time-equivalent workers to offer affordable insurance to employees working 30 or more hours a week or face fines. There have been some anecdotal reports about businesses, such as restaurants, gas stations and convenience stores, cutting their employees\u2019 hours back to avoid those fines.\n\nBut empirical data doesn\u2019t yet show a big increase in part-time work that could be attributed to the health care law. An analysis from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Urban Institute found that while part-time work has increased this year beyond what might normally expected at this point in an economic expansion, that increase isn\u2019t specific to part-time jobs below the 30-hour threshold that is affected by the health care law.\n\nIf businesses were cutting workers\u2019 hours to comply with the law\u2019s mandate, it might also result in a shorter average workweek. The data on this front is mixed. While the average workweek has declined since 2012 for the retail sector, the average workweek has increased over the past year in the leisure and hospitality sector.\n\nFinally, if businesses had a preference for part-time workers over full-time workers, that might ultimately be reflected in wages. But wage growth for full-time workers, while weak, has outpaced that of part-time workers over the past few years, according to data from the Atlanta Fed.\n\nRelated coverage:\n\nPost-Recession Legacy: Elevated Level of Part-Time Employment?", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "The unemployment rate has dropped sharply over the past year, but the share of Americans working part time because they can\u2019t find full-time work remains very high by historical standards.", "title": "Why Are So Many Workers Still Part Time?
