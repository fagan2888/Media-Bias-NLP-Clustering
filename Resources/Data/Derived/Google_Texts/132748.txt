Americans United for Change, a liberal advocacy group, singled out a senior Florida Department of Health official today for asking county health departments to block federal advisers from helping people receive Obamacare services. The background is here, the statement is here:

“C. Meade Grigg, the deputy Florida Department of Health secretary for statewide services, must be sick of his job because clearly he has no interest in doing it anymore. According to the FL DOH website, its Mission is to ‘protect, promote & improve the health of all people in Florida,’ its Vision is to ‘be the Healthiest State in the Nation’. Mr. Grigg needs to explain how that mission was not entirely compromised when he banished from FL health department premises the people who have been tapped by the federal government to help uninsured Floridians navigate the new health law and the benefits available to them. Among the groups that for no good reason Griggs has deemed outcasts: the Epilepsy Foundation of Florida, Mental Health America and the National Hispanic Council on Aging. Grigg should know better than most that thousands of people die every year because they didn’t have insurance, so why is he standing in the way of Floridians enrolling in a plan? Retired Pasco County Health Director Dr. Marc Yacht is absolutely right: Grigg’s actions are ‘cruel and irresponsible.’ I would add incompetent.”
