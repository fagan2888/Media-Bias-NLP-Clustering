Fallon celebrated its centennial in 2008.\n\nRubio gave a condensed version of his campaign speech to business and education leaders followed by a question and answer session. By visiting Nevada, Rubio emphasized the importance the state has in selecting the next Republican nominee and possibly the next president.\n\n\u201cWhile every election is important, the next election is critical,\u201d Rubio said.\n\nRubio, whose parents emigrated from Cuba to the United States in the mid-1950s, lived the American dream, but he sees that concept fading away as people struggle in their everyday lives and live from paycheck to paycheck. Others who had good jobs have lost them because of technology, or jobs have been outsourced to another country. His concern is for future generations.\n\nHe said young Americans are struggling in student debt and can\u2019t buy a home, start a business or find a job.\n\n\u201cThe American dream definitely makes us different from the rest of the world,\u201d he said.\n\nYet, he issued a warning.\n\n\u201cIf we continue own the road we are on right now, we will lose what makes America special,\u201d he added.\n\nRubio, though, said he is worried that the next generation may be worse off than their parents. He said the United States must be able to compete in a global economy.\n\n\u201cToday, we have the most expensive business taxes in the world, the most complicated tax code in the world and the most out-of-control regulations,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to Rubio, ideas are outdated and leaders don\u2019t know what to do.\n\nFurthermore, he said Americans are trapped in their education.\n\n\u201cWe must confront the higher ed monopoly that exists in America and modernize the system to meet the needs of our people in this new era,\u201d he pointed out.\n\nRubio said the need is there for those wanting to take vocational classes or complete technological programs.\n\n\u201cMany of the best jobs in the 21st century will need more education than high school but less than four years in college,\u201d he said.\n\nHis comments regarding a strong military and keeping America safe received positive reaction in this military community. He said a lunatic is leading North Korea, the Chinese are expanding into the South China Sea and hacking into U.S. computer systems, a \u201cgangster\u201d in charge of Russia is trying to divide Europe and Iran is on the verge of acquiring nuclear weapons. He said the country must rebuild the military to face the challenges of today\u2019s world and five-to-10 years from now.\n\nRubio said the country\u2019s foreign policy must show more clarity so that America\u2019s allies trust Washington and feel the government is not leaving them behind.\n\nIn his question-and-answer session, Rubio was asked specific questions ranging from education to land.\n\nHis first question dealt with the party\u2019s leadership and their commitment. Rubio first replied that he became a conservative because Ronald Reagan was president when he, Rubio, was in his teens. He said Republicans including the leadership still believe in free enterprise and smaller government. He said the Republican Party cares about the people and wants to crate ore jobs.\n\nLVN columnist and Fallon businessman Tom Riggins said he was concerned with the number of career federal employees and their philosophy.\n\n\u201cYou mean the bureaucracy?\u201d Rubio shot back.\n\nRubio said when Congress passes more regulations, it costs Americans.\n\n\u201cEvery time we write new regulations, we have more people (federal employees) to enforce regulations,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the contrary, Rubio said the government should be shrinking, not increasing the federal workforce.\n\nHe said every employee should be removed because of incompetence. In 2014, he said Congress gave the new secretary of the Veterans Administration the power to fire administrators for not doing their jobs. So far, he said only one has been fired.\n\n\u201cMy secretary of the VA would go in and clean house and fire people who are not doing their jobs,\u201d Rubio said.\n\nCounty Commissioner Bus Scharmann asked Rubio his position of the federal government owning so much state land. In Nevada the feds own 84 percent.\n\nRubio said he would be open to the transfer of lands from the federal government to the state and private parties.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe the federal government should own as much land in Nevada,\u201d he said.\n\nFormer Commissioner Norm Frey expressed frustration with the checkerboard pattern of land holdings either between the federal and local governments or the feds and private owners. Frey said the checkerboard land holdings stifle local development. Rubio said he would be open to transfer of lands to private owners.\n\nRubio was asked about the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare. The senator discussed healthcare in his opening remarks, and said it is a detriment to the economy. According to Rubio, Obamacare must be repealed because it has lowered the quality of healthcare that people are receiving while premiums are costing more\n\nRubio said if the private sector was selling health insurance, the companies would be fighting to sell policies to the public.\n\nAdditionally, Rubio said employees are turning down promotions, for example, for fear of losing subsidies with their current policies.\n\nRubio was asked about his accomplishments in the U.S. Senate since he was first elected in November 2010. He said an anti-human trafficking bill requiring foreign countries to issue birth certificates to girls was monumental. He said it makes it harder for traffickers to sell or abduct the children.\n\nHe also said he was proud not to approve the extension of the debt ceiling.\n\nWestern Nevada College President Chet Burton asked Rubio to elaborate on his position on vocational education. Rubio said it\u2019s acceptable that some students want to be a doctor or lawyer, but that the workforce also needs welders and others who work in the trades.\n\nRubio also likes the idea of students taking trade-school courses while still attending high school.\n\nOne person asked Rubio to discuss immigration. He said it is important to bring the immigration problem under control with the undocumented residents and to do it in steps.\n\nIn another question regarding education, Rubio responded by saying the country does not need a Department of Education, and he does not believe in Common Core standards, which he called a national curriculum.\n\nRubio said communities and state must create their own curriculum.\n\nThose in attendance said they were impressed with Rubio. Bob Clifford attended the Basque Fry three weeks ago when four Republican presidential candidates attended the event in Gardnerville, hosted by Attorney General Adam Laxalt.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s bright and has a great sense of balance in how to handle the issues,\u201d Clifford said. \u201cI like his approach on educational and immigration.\u201d\n\nClifford said he likes Rubio\u2019s leadership ideas of where to take America after the next election.\n\nBurton said Rubio is setting the tempo when he discussed education and the need for more vocational courses and programs offered in the high-school setting.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio concluded his two-day swing in Northern Nevada Tuesday by addressing community leaders in Fallon followed by a rally at the convention center attended by", "og": {"url": "http://www.NevadaAppeal.com/news/government/17966819-113/rubio-makes-fallon-stop", "image": {"identifier": "http://www.NevadaAppeal.com/csp/mediapool/sites/dt.common.streams.StreamServer.cls?STREAMOID=OHpizqOff4tiZ6dJh_e8DM$daE2N3K4ZzOUsqbU5sYsBWJwGTC8WbrIugnRoJFxlWCsjLu883Ygn4B49Lvm9bPe2QeMKQdVeZmXF$9l$4uCZ8QDXhaHEp3rvzXRJFdy0KqPHLoMevcTLo3h8xh70Y6N_U_CryOsw6FTOdKL_jpQ-&CONTENTTYPE=image/jpeg", "type": "image/jpeg"}, "site_name": "The Nevada Appeal", "description": "Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio concluded his two-day swing in Northern Nevada Tuesday by addressing community leaders in Fallon followed by a rally at the convention center attended by", "title": "Rubio makes Fallon stop | NevadaAppeal.com"}, "twitter": {"site": "@NevadaAppeal", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 555484641151578}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 17966819}}, "__sync_contentCategory": "Paid", "keywords": "RUBIO, EDUCATION, AMERICA, JOBS, NEVADA, LEADERS, REPUBLICAN, FEDERAL, GOVERNMENT, ATTENDED", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdfdd\"", "article_summary": "\u201cMy secretary of the VA would go in and clean house and fire people who are not doing their jobs,\u201d Rubio said.\nBy visiting Nevada, Rubio emphasized the importance the state has in selecting the next Republican nominee and possibly the next president.\nOne person asked Rubio to discuss immigration.\nRubio first replied that he became a conservative because Ronald Reagan was president when he, Rubio, was in his teens.\nCounty Commissioner Bus Scharmann asked Rubio his position of the federal government owning so much state land."}
