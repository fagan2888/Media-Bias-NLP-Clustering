An Atlanta Journal-Constitution poll offers a glimpse of the frustrated mood of Republican voters, and the more optimistic outlook of Democrats, less than two months before Georgia holds its presidential primary on March 1.

A clean majority of Republican voters want the next president to be someone outside the existing establishment, according to the poll, and a staggering portion of GOP voters — more than 90 percent — feel the nation is on the wrong track.

Democrats have an almost polar-opposite view. Eighty-three percent of them want someone with political experience and two-thirds are confident in the country’s direction.

And it shows independents — that influential voting bloc that in Georgia typically leans toward the GOP — harbor deep misgivings about the nation’s future and the front-runners in both parties.

The poll, conducted by ABT SRBI, also indicated that many Georgia Republicans are open to several of the top contenders in the packed field.
