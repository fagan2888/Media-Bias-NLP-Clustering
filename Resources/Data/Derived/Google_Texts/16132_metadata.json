The program costs the hospitals a fraction of what it would if those patients came to the ER, NBC News reported.\n\n\"What's really the biggest cost in health care are the chronic conditions where there are readmissions to the emergency department,\" North Memorial Chief Medical Officer Kevin Croston, M.D. told NBC News. \"We realized we needed to create care that stopped that.\"\n\nThe system has yet to collect specific savings data, but officials interviewed for the article said the community paramedics are helping patients control chronic diseases at home, especially those with diabetes who may have neglected to take their insulin. It also gives healthcare professionals more time with the patients, allowing them to better understand the patients' needs and specific areas of concern, according to the article.\n\nThe idea has translated into financial savings for other facilities. House calls for low-income families with asthma helped save Children's Hospital Boston $1.46 million, FierceHealthcare previously reported, with the hospital boasting a 68 percent decrease from baseline in asthma-related emergency department visits and an 85 percent drop in hospitalizations.\n\nNorth Memorial isn't the only health network using outreach to prevent ER visits. Woodland Hills (Calif.) Medical Center and several other hospitals use 'homeless navigators' to help indigent patients find housing or treatment centers after discharge, reducing the rate of \"frequent flyer\" hospital stays, which cost an average of $1,500 a night in uncompensated care at the facility, FierceHealthcare previously reported.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the article\n\nRelated articles:\n\n'Homeless navigators' help reduce ER visits, readmissions\n\n'Frequent flyer' visits drop with coordinated care\n\nHome visits for asthma patients cut hospitalizations\n\nPhysicians--and competitors--making more house calls\n\nGreater volume, intensity of care strains hospital EDs", "article_metadata": {"description": "In an effort to reduce emergency room admissions among the uninsured and chronically ill, one Minnesota healthcare provider is having its paramedics make house calls, a move officials believe could...", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "In an effort to reduce emergency room admissions among the uninsured and chronically ill, one Minnesota healthcare provider is having its paramedics make house calls, a move officials believe could...", "title": "Paramedic home visits may reduce ER visits, readmission rates", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/paramedic-home-visits-may-reduce-er-visits-readmission-rates/2013-12-02", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Care Delivery,Emergency Room,Frequent Fliers,Home Visits,Patient Care & Outcomes,readmissions", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca2fa\"", "article_summary": "North Memorial isn't the only health network using outreach to prevent ER visits.\nTo learn more:- read the articleRelated articles:'Homeless navigators' help reduce ER visits, readmissions'Frequent flyer' visits drop with coordinated careHome visits for asthma patients cut hospitalizationsPhysicians--and competitors--making more house callsGreater volume, intensity of care strains hospital EDs\nThe program costs the hospitals a fraction of what it would if those patients came to the ER, NBC News reported.\n\"What's really the biggest cost in health care are the chronic conditions where there are readmissions to the emergency department,\" North Memorial Chief Medical Officer Kevin Croston, M.D.\nIn an effort to reduce emergency room admissions among the uninsured and chronically ill, one Minnesota healthcare provider is having its paramedics make house calls, a move officials believe could result in major savings, NBC News reported."}
