Christmas and New Year's are milestones to take measure of what we have received and accomplished and to anticipate how much the next 12 months might glow with optimism and promise.So the New Hampshire Sunday News asked business people around the state how they fared this year and what the coming year might look like. Many respondents cited gains in their businesses, evidence that the state's economy is improving.The state also continues to show a brighter pictures on the jobs front.New Hampshire's unemployment rate stood at 3.2 percent in November — nearly a percentage point better than the previous year's 4 percent — and remained ahead of the national unemployment rate of 5 percent.Our participants include representatives from manufacturing — including one whose plant burned to the ground in 2014 — retail, health care, technology, nonprofit, hospitality, public relations and tourism.: “I would say growth would be our biggest accomplishment. We've really, really grown and we pride ourselves on our customer service. That's kind of hard to find these days.”: With making upcoming store changes coming after a recent fire in the same building, “It's like a good kick in the pants to do it.“I think it's going to be tremendous, tremendous next year. I had no idea of all the customers that have come up to me and been so supportive.”: “Our team building and approach: With no staff turnover this year, we celebrated our five-year anniversary by rebranding as a visibility company, which was done in-house with full team collaboration.”: “Expanding through growth and partnerships, so weare on the short list for anyone looking to boost their visibility.”: In 2015, we were able to advance (our) collaborative online meeting platform, AlignMeeting, from concept to customer trials. In recognition of our accomplishment, we received a $30,000 prize from the New Hampshire High Tech Council in the 2015 TechOut Competition and were selected as finalists for Steve Case's Rise of the Rest competition. We're proud to be a part of the New Hampshire startup ecosystem and are grateful for the support and recognition we've received from the New Hampshire High Tech Council and the New Hampshire business community.: In 2016, we will have a huge impact on people who lead and manage teams to reach a common goal (project managers, program managers, team leaders, committee chairs) by making one of their most time-intensive activities abundantly more productive — meetings. We will commercially launch AlignMeeting and make meetings more collaborative and effective and enable the meeting notes and outcomes to effortlessly integrate into the workflow.: Double-digit percentage growth in both our café and catering divisions through more diverse and flexible menus, premium wine and spirit selections, event design options and expertise, the opening of our second retail café (Bayona Café) and ground-breaking of our third (Unity Café, opening January 2016).: Becoming a more prominent player in the on-site event marketplace by adding new event rooms and overall square footage to allow for larger and multiple groups for both corporate and social clients.: Growing our staff from one person (after five years) to three people and creating our organization's first-ever strategic plan!: 2016 is going to be a HUGE year for us — continuing to grow staff, rolling out components of our strategic plan, curating our “economic development” space in the new 93-S welcome center, continuing our new “Life of the Party” political series for young professionals, and so much more!: “Our biggest accomplishment in 2015 has been the dramatic growth of both our customers and our PillPack team. We're extremely proud of the folks that have joined us to make pharmacy simpler and easier for our customers. In the past year, we've been able to add over 150 people to our Manchester office.”: “For 2016, we plan to continue growing and strengthening our team here in Manchester, and keep making PillPack a rewarding place to work. We expect to significantly expand both our pharmacy and office space in the next 6 months — and more than double our employees in the next 12 months.”: “Northeast Delta Dental effectively engaged the Affordable Care Act by adding over 6,100 lives on the public and Northeast Delta Dental private exchanges — citizens who did not have oral health coverage before.”: “Northeast Delta Dental will transform the dental benefits/oral health industry with its new evidence-based Health Through Oral Wellness Program.”: “Ragged Mountain Resort's biggest accomplishment for 2015 is real estate development. We have finished the first phase in our multi-year development of ski-in, ski-out lodging is complete, the Cardigan Cabins. In addition to the Cardigan Cabins, The New Hampshire Mountain was purchased earlier in the year by the parent company of Ragged Mountain Resort to offer nearby lodging,” he said.“Building on Mountain lodging is key to the success of Ragged Mountain Resort”. Lodging around the immediate area was virtually nonexistent, until now. The cabins will be available year round and expected to be used for ski vacations and our growing wedding business.”: “For 2016, Ragged Mountain Resort plans to continue working towards the ski area expansion and real estate development. We are working towards expanding the mountain by opening a third peak and adding more beginner terrain within the next couple seasons. As part of the multi-year expansion, Ragged Mountain plans to break ground on more slopeside lodging this coming spring.”: I can answer a couples ways. Honestly our biggest accomplishment is just being here this year since we burned down in 2014. But it really comes down to not only rebuilding, but to thrive in this economy. Our business has gown almost 30 percent, and we have been able to add about 30 new jobs.: For 2016, we see a great future as we will be certified USDA and will be able to launch our new meat pizzas and a new handheld item. Additionally in 2016, we will plan to activate the hydro power plant at our Main Street location to supply the majority of our own power needs.: “Our biggest accomplishment is our sales were more than any other year. Our sales are up, I think, about 20 percent.: “Our accomplishment for next year is to continue to grow.”: Our biggest accomplishment as we finish our first year as innkeepers was being able take on a successful bed and breakfast and continue to provide the excellent service our guests have come to expect. We have also started interacting more with local businesses to let them know that there is an alternative to the chain hotels for visiting clients and staff. And finally getting the word out, that, yes, Manchester does indeed have a bed and breakfast in town.: We expect that in 2016 our business will continue to grow. The primary season provides an early jump-start to a successful year. This, coupled with the improved economy and the increased number of quality restaurants and cultural events, will lead to a steady rise in tourism for Manchester and New Hampshire.: In 2015, we acquired two manufacturers in Europe, Alfatex and Gevaert, which strengthened our position as the leading independent company in the global fastening industry. These acquisitions added to our capabilities in high-growth sectors such as medical, automotive, industrial and apparel. We also opened a production facility in Uruguay to bolster our growing business in Latin America. We continued to invest in R&D to develop new innovations, and we produced enough hook-and-loop material in 2015 to circle the Earth 100 times.In the year ahead, Velcro Companies will be the “go-to” workplace for engineers and scientists in New Hampshire. Building a world-class, global research and development effort is one of our top priorities, and we will offer great opportunities for the region's best and brightest. We've been a big part of the manufacturing industry in New Hampshire for the past 60 years and will continue to be in 2016. We also expect strong growth for our Press-Lok closure technology, which can be found in a range of consumer product packages, including pet foods, detergent pods, cheese, protein powder, granola, garden materials, coffee and nuts.
