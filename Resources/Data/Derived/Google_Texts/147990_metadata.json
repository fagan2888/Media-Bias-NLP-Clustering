The draw puts Liverpool ninth on 14 points, with Southampton a place above on the same total but better goal difference.\n\nLiverpool\u2019s first-half display was full of the pressing from midfield which Klopp is known for, particularly in the early exchanges.\n\nBut Liverpool was toothless in attack. Southampton comfortably defended its own penalty area and reduced the hosts to shots from long range, while beginning to pose problems in attack as the half progressed.\n\nKlopp responded by replacing striker Divock Origi, who started the game as Daniel Sturridge missed his third straight match due to a knee problem, with Benteke.\n\nHis presence galvanized the team and the atmosphere inside Anfield.\n\nLiverpool appeared more urgent in attack, with Alberto Moreno frequently providing an outlet down the left but often failing to deliver an incisive final ball or apply a shot on target.\n\nWhen the goal eventually came, it was created by the captain Milner, who collected a wayward pass from Nathaniel Clyne with his back to goal wide on the right. Southampton stood away and Milner swiveled, saw Benteke and whipped the ball onto his head.\n\nAs the ball hit the back of the net, a jubilant Klopp ran along the sideline, leapt up and punched the air but eight minutes later, he was standing on the spot looking bewildered.\n\nRamirez nodded Ward-Prowse\u2019s searching free kick across the Liverpool goal and Mane, unnoticed at the back post by Liverpool\u2019s defense, ran onto the ball and prodded it over the line.\n\nIt silenced Anfield, and Klopp felt the goal stunned his players, too.\n\n\u201cWhat I saw after the (Southampton) goal, maybe this is the problem,\u201d Klopp said. \u201cThey were all so disappointed but this is football. You can receive goals. There was another chance but there was no belief there anymore, in their eyes.\n\n\u201cI told them there was no contact between the players in this moment, nobody was able to push, to say something positive.\u201d\n\nLiverpool has drawn all three of its matches under Klopp so far.\n\nSouthampton\u2019s scorer Mane was sent off in added time for a second bookable offense.\n\n\u201cI scored a goal but it is more important to get points for my team, I think we played very good football,\u201d Mane said. \u201cI made two stupid fouls and I was sent off.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Southampton held Liverpool to a 1-1 draw on Sunday as Sadio Mane's late goal denied Juergen Klopp his first victory since taking over as manager at Anfield.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Southampton held Liverpool to a 1-1 draw on Sunday as Sadio Mane\u2019s late goal denied Juergen Klopp his first victory since taking over as manager at Anfield.", "title": "Liverpool held to a 1-1 draw by Southampton at Anfield", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/oct/25/liverpool-held-to-a-1-1-draw-by-southampton-at-anf/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/10/25/d744f979f8fdd92f850f6a7067001e18.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/10/25/d744f979f8fdd92f850f6a7067001e18.jpg", "description": "Southampton held Liverpool to a 1-1 draw on Sunday as Sadio Mane's late goal denied Juergen Klopp his first victory since taking over as manager at Anfield.", "card": "summary", "title": "Liverpool held to a 1-1 draw by Southampton at Anfield"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "LIVERPOOL, England (AP) - Southampton held Liverpool to a 1-1 draw on Sunday as Sadio Mane\u2019s late goal denied Juergen Klopp his first victory since taking over as manager at Anfield.\nThe draw puts Liverpool ninth on 14 points, with Southampton a place above on the same total but better goal difference.\n\u201cWhat I saw after the (Southampton) goal, maybe this is the problem,\u201d Klopp said.\nBut Mane bundled the ball in from close range after Gaston Ramirez headed James Ward-Prowse\u2019s free kick across the Liverpool goal four minutes from full time.\nLiverpool took the lead in the 78th minute when substitute Christian Benteke met a precise delivery from captain James Milner with a towering header."}
