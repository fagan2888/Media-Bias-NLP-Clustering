But before Sunday\u2019s game at the Pepsi Center, the crowd found a way to say it missed the man and was happy to see him again, showering him with affection.\n\n\u201cThis situation has a lot emotion, a lot of love, a lot of connection,\u201d Karl said before coaching the Sacramento Kings in their 122-111 loss to the Nuggets, his former team. \u201cA lot of wins in this building. A lot of fantastic games.\u201d\n\nThe Nuggets are a very different team now.\n\nPHOTOS: Denver Nuggets beat Sacramento Kings 122-111\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t deny, the first year, it didn\u2019t feel good watching them play poorly,\u201d Karl said. \u201cSometimes you may be rooting for them to play poorly, and then others times, \u2018Why are they playing so poorly?\u2019 Caught in the quandary of \u2026 how it disintegrated so fast, I think was actually painful to me.\u201d\n\nAsked whether the sting from being fired after a 57-win season endured, Karl hedged.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if I had hard feelings,\u201d he said. \u201cI had disappointment. I didn\u2019t understand (being fired). But I have too many good memories here. I remember the day of the firing, the laughter and fun I had with my guys. So I don\u2019t know if there are hard feelings. I wanted to end my life here. I wanted to end my career here. They took that away from me. But they gave me nine years, paid me well, had great teams.\u201d\n\nKarl fretted about stopping some of the players he used to coach, and he was right. For the Nuggets (30-50), it was a fun finish to what has at times been a frightening season at home.\n\nThe Nuggets have had only seven losing home seasons, and this is one of them.\n\nBut the 18-23 home record ranks fifth-worst out of the seven. The switch to interim coach Melvin Hunt, who pushed the pace back up to how the Nuggets used to play, and a more energized and engaged roster, resulted in a 7-4 home record down the stretch \u2014 after the team went 11-19 at the Pepsi Center under previous coach Brian Shaw.\n\nIt was important to the Nuggets to finish the season strong in front of the fans who had seen so many struggles at the Pepsi Center.\n\n\u201cThey keep us going,\u201d Hunt said. \u201cThat\u2019s why it hurt during the year when we were getting booed. I\u2019ll never forget the 84-point half against Portland. I\u2019m not an emotional guy, but I was an inch from tears myself. It hurt. And hearing those boos hurt. But I know that they were hurting.\n\n\u201cBut fast forward to today\u2019s game. The effort our guys have been able to put out there, what a turnaround.\u201d\n\nKenneth Faried scored a season-high 30 points, made 12-of-14 shots and grabbed seven rebounds. He said it was bittersweet playing against Karl, the coach who drafted him.\n\n\u201cI knew I had to do a job today,\u201d Faried said. \u201cBut it was also good to see my former head coach.\u201d\n\nChristopher Dempsey: cdempsey@denverpost.com or twitter.com/dempseypost\n\nDENVER AT L.A.
