Still, it\u2019s important to say a few words about the late Thursday evening announcement that Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius had resigned.\n\nIf there was ever an example of what happens when you get your second choice (Or was it third?) for an important job, she was it. An almost accidental governor of Kansas, she was even more so an accidental cabinet member, put into a job no one else seemed to want because it meant riding point on President Barack Obama\u2019s effort to have Washington take over the federal health care system.\n\nThanks in large part to her skill and natural ability, it almost didn\u2019t happen. She was an ineffective advocate for a piece of legislation that finally passed by the narrowest of margins and only after the president and a group of pro-life Democrats in the House of Representatives agreed (wink wink, nod nod) that the resulting law would not expropriate federal funds for abortion coverage.\n\n[See a collection of political cartoons on Obamacare.]\n\nFrom backroom deals with insurance companies to failed web sites, Sebelius\u2019 work on behalf of the design and implementation of Obamacare has only contributed to its being the colossal embarrassment it has proven to be. South Dakota Sen. John Thune captured things accurately when he said, \u201cUnfortunately for the American people, Secretary Sebelius\u2019 resignation will do nothing to protect them from ObamaCare\u2019s canceled coverage, skyrocketing costs, and fewer choices.\u201d\n\n\u201cObamaCare is fundamentally flawed and a personnel change at HHS won\u2019t change that ugly reality,\u201d the Senate's number three Republican said in a release. \u201cThe only way to protect American families, workers, and small businesses from ObamaCare\u2019s consequences is to scrap this law and start over with common-sense reforms that actually reduce health care costs.\u201d\n\nIf anyone thought for a moment it was a case of \u201cfailure by design\u201d then we might have a reason to thank her for her efforts since, in more capable hands, the whole process might have gone much more smoothly. Unfortunately for her, the way the whole business has unfolded \u2013 and will continue to unfold \u2013 was the only possible path forward. What few people are willing to admit but is nevertheless true is that Obamacare is a \u201chalf-measure\u201d whose malfunctions are deliberate in order to pave the way for the liberal left's actual dream: a single-payer health care system on the Canadian model. And if you think you had to wait a long time to get on the healthcare.gov website, wait until that system goes into effect and you have to see a doctor. You could be dead from whatever you have before a doctor is available to see you and make a diagnosis.\n\n[ Check out our editorial cartoons on President Obama.]\n\nIt\u2019s not just a problem of policy affecting the American people; it\u2019s a problem of politics affecting the Democrats. The polling shows the health care law is dragging down Senate and House candidates who should be having an easier time of it than they are. \"The next HHS Secretary will inherit a mess \u2014 Americans facing rising costs, families losing their doctors, and an economy weighed down by intrusive regulations,\u201d Republican National Chairman Reince Priebus said in a statement. \u201cNo matter who is in charge of HHS, ObamaCare will continue to be a disaster and will continue to hurt hardworking Americans. It's time for President Obama to admit that Democrats' signature law is a failure and heed Republican calls for patient-centered healthcare reform.\"\n\nMost folks leave the president\u2019s cabinet with a hearty handshake and a reassuring \u201cjob well done\u201d from the president. Even Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld \u2013 whom I like personally and whom I believe was made a scapegoat for the failure of others to effectively manage things in Iraq after the fall of Saddam Hussein \u2013 got that from George W. Bush, albeit too late to do any good electorally. The best anyone can say of Sebelius, whose official portrait should someday hang in the darkest corner of the hallway outside the secretary\u2019s office, is that she should take care to \u201cmake sure the door don\u2019t hit you where the good Lord split you\u201d on her way out.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "title": "Kathleen Sebelius' Obamacare Failures and Embarrassing Tenure Are Over", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Kathleen Sebelius and her less-than admirable work won't be missed.", "title": "Goodbye, Farewell and Get Lost", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/peter-roff/2014/04/11/kathleen-sebelius-obamacare-failures-and-embarrassing-tenure-are-over", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/12/e78820233ee28c447a4329bea291e7/media:881389942bd248b9ac0595a6140ae213ObamaHealthSecretaryResignation.JPEG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "Kathleen Sebelius and her less-than admirable work won't be missed.", "card": "summary", "title": "Kathleen Sebelius' Obamacare Failures and Embarrassing Tenure Are Over"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "opinion", "date_published": "April 11, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Peter Roff,health care reform,Affordable Care Act,Sebelius, Kathleen,HHS,Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Kathleen Sebelius and her less-than admirable work won't be missed."}, "article_summary": "The polling shows the health care law is dragging down Senate and House candidates who should be having an easier time of it than they are.\nStill, it\u2019s important to say a few words about the late Thursday evening announcement that Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius had resigned.\n\u201cNo matter who is in charge of HHS, ObamaCare will continue to be a disaster and will continue to hurt hardworking Americans.\nIf there was ever an example of what happens when you get your second choice (Or was it third?)\nMost folks leave the president\u2019s cabinet with a hearty handshake and a reassuring \u201cjob well done\u201d from the president."}
