Sue Lewis and Amy Gillcrist, formerly with Sendant Health, have created a new hybrid medical practice that accepts both membership and traditional adult patients. Unlike Sendant Health, AIM Health provides a more affordable membership level to ideally bring the concept of concierge medicine to a wider range of audiences.\n\n\u201cWe started this practice because we believe physicians can better serve patients by giving them more time and access,\u201d said Dr. Amy Gillcrist, medical director and internal medicine physician at AIM Health. \u201cAccording to the Centers for Disease Control, one in seven adults suffers from chronic disease; many are preventable with behavior change. Today\u2019s bottomline-focused healthcare system falls short of providing the physician the time needed to help patients manage behavior change. At AIM Health, the core ingredient is time. Time to research, care and become a true partner in managing their health.\u201d\n\nConcierge medicine, the idea where patients pay a monthly fee to gain better access to their physician, has been on the rise nationally, with more than 4,500 physicians practicing in the U.S. According to a 2014 Kaiser Health News article, today\u2019s traditional fee-for-service healthcare model rewards physicians for seeing patients in bulk, thereby reducing time spent and the physician\u2019s ability to manage more complex issues in a typical 15-minute doctor visit. This is compounded by the millions of consumers now entering the system due to the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cBy all accounts, short visits take a toll on the doctor-patient relationship, which is considered a key ingredient of good care, and may represent a missed opportunity for getting patients more actively involved in their own health,\u201d Kaiser Health News.\n\nAIM Health plans to combat this issue by keeping the patient load smaller for the clinic overall. This way both membership and traditionally paying patients gain more time and attention from their physician. \u201cLowering the patient load enables us to spend valuable time researching and better understanding our patients\u2019 conditions so we can practice better medicine. This luxury of time is not something traditional clinics can do when a physician is seeing in 25\u201430 patients a day.\u201d\n\nAIM Health\u2019s membership is $100 per month and gives members longer, more personal visits, same day or next day appointments, and 24/7 access to their doctor by cell phone, text or email.\n\n\u201cPatients love being able to just pick up the phone and call me,\u201d said Dr. Gillcrist. \u201cI'm able to answer questions and help discern the need for a visit right over the phone.\u201d\n\nThe membership is positioned as an upgrade, one that can begin or be cancelled at any time. Office visits and services are billed to insurance just like traditional medical clinics.\n\nDrs. Lewis and Gillcrist have also expanded the practice to include Dr. Kathryn Kolonic, a family medicine physician who will be joining the practice in May 2016. In addition, the physicians will be building a new clinic location in West Linn. AIM Health is currently accepting new patients and has a temporary location at 18603 Willamette Drive in West Linn, Ore., until the new clinic is complete. AIM Health accepts most insurance plans and, contrasting another national healthcare trend, AIM Health actively accepts Medicare patients.\n\nFor more information, visit aimhealthnw.com.\n\nAbout AIM Health, LLC\n\nAIM Health is a primary care medical practice located in West Linn, Oregon, and was founded on the belief that better healthcare is possible.
