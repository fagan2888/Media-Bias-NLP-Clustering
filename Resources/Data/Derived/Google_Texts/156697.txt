A Connecticut Obamacare exchange worker has admitted to taking personal information about enrollees out of the office, information that was found in a backpack left on a Hartford street last week, officials said.

The worker, an employee of the exchange's call center vendor Maximus, has been suspended as officials continue investigating the breach related to about 400 insurance plan enrollees. It is believed to be Obamacare's first-ever breach of enrollees' personal data.

"While we are still working to understand exactly why this person took the information out of the building, based on what we have learned so far, it does not appear there was malfeasance on the part of this person," said Jason Madrak, chief marketing officer of the Access Health CT exchange.

Maximus, in its own statement Monday, said that an investigation "has led us to believe that this was an incident where there was no malicious intent."

"At this time, Maximus has no reason to believe that any of the information in the backpack has been misused," the company said.
