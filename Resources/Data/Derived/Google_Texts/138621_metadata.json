His State of the Union address was bereft of big ideas. And his declaration that he will use his \u201cpen and a phone\u201d to issue a raft of executive orders is an admission of political impotence \u2014 a presidency reduced to small-ball initiatives like creating \u201cmyRA\u201d savings accounts and raising the minimum wage for federal contractors.\n\nThe one exception \u2014 his one last shot at a major legislative achievement \u2014 was comprehensive immigration reform. But that isn\u2019t happening either.\n\nAnd the reason can be summed up in one word: Obamacare.\n\n\u201cComprehensive\u201d is Washington-speak for \u201cbig.\u201d And in the wake of the Obamacare debacle, no one is interested in anything big from Barack Obama.\n\n\u201cI try to focus not on the fumbles but on the next plan,\u201d Obama said this weekend. But when you fumble as spectacularly as the president did with Obamacare, people don\u2019t trust your next plan.\n\nIt\u2019s not just that Americans don\u2019t trust the president\u2019s competence. Increasingly, they don\u2019t trust him \u2014 period. A majority believe the president passed Obamacare on the basis of a lie. And when you lie to people, they stop listening to you. Obama\u2019s State of the Union address garnered the lowest ratings of any president in 14 years \u2014 with 19 million fewer viewers than his first address in 2009. Obama can\u2019t rally the country around big ideas when millions of Americans are tuning him out.\n\nAnd Obama certainly can\u2019t rally Congress around big ideas when he is simultaneously declaring his intention to circumvent it. Every time Obama mentions using his \u201cpen and a phone,\u201d he reminds Republicans that he can undo any immigration deal he reaches with them with a stroke of his pen \u2014 gutting border-enforcement provisions while pocketing legalization. As Paul Ryan, a leading GOP supporter of immigration reform, put it this weekend, \u201cWe have an increasingly lawless presidency, where he is actually doing the job of Congress, writing new policies and new laws without going through Congress. . . . We don\u2019t trust the president to enforce the law.\u201d\n\nRyan is right. Whether it is ignoring the law that requires him to suspend U.S. assistance to Egypt following a coup, or delaying the implementation of the Obamacare employer mandate even though nothing in the law permits him to do so, or issuing an executive order directing immigration officers to no longer deport an entire class of illegal immigrants who came here as children, regardless of individual circumstances \u2014 Obama has repeatedly shown his contempt for the law. Through his words (\u201cyou can keep your plan\u201d), actions (selectively enforcing the law) and incompetence ( Healthcare.gov), Obama has eroded the trust needed to do big things. And that makes it unlikely we will see any major initiatives signed into law for the remainder of his time in office.\n\nBut the damage is deeper than the impact on Obama\u2019s closing years in office. Americans have lost confidence not only in Obama\u2019s competence but also in the competence of the federal government. And therein lies the great, unintended conservative achievement of the Obama presidency: Barack Obama has done more to discredit the cause of big government than a thousand Reagan speeches ever did.\n\nAfter five years of Obama, 72 percent of Americans now say big government is the biggest threat to our country \u2014 the highest that number has been in 50 years of polling. Even 56 percent of Democrats agree. In other words, when people look back at the Obama era, they will not say, as he hoped, that this is the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow. They will say it was the moment when the rise in support for big government began to slow and, indeed, reverse.\n\nFor the next quarter-century, any time a liberal politician proposes a big-government program, all conservatives will have to say to discredit it is: \u201cIt\u2019s just another Obamacare.\u201d\n\nThat, in the end, will be this president\u2019s lasting achievement \u2014 what Obama will ultimately be remembered for long after his presidency is over.\n\nRead more from Marc Thiessen\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Obama has eroded the trust needed to do big things.", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/marcthiessen", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Obama has eroded the trust needed to do big things.", "title": "Marc Thiessen: How Obamacare killed immigration reform", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/marc-thiessen-how-obamacare-killed-immigration-reform/2014/02/03/a2536836-8ce5-11e3-98ab-fe5228217bd1_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/02/03/Editorial-Opinion/Images/Obama-0d72f-1866.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@marcthiessen"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/marc-thiessen-how-obamacare-killed-immigration-reform/2014/02/03/a2536836-8ce5-11e3-98ab-fe5228217bd1_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Marc Thiessen, obamacare, obama trust, big government, state of the union, myra, immigration reform, lame duck obama,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/marcthiessen"}, "eomportal-uuid": "a2536836-8ce5-11e3-98ab-fe5228217bd1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Marc Thiessen, obamacare, obama trust, big government, state of the union, myra, immigration reform, lame duck obama,"}, "article_summary": "But when you fumble as spectacularly as the president did with Obamacare, people don\u2019t trust your next plan.\nIt\u2019s not just that Americans don\u2019t trust the president\u2019s competence.\nThe one exception \u2014 his one last shot at a major legislative achievement \u2014 was comprehensive immigration reform.\nIncreasingly, they don\u2019t trust him \u2014 period.\nWe don\u2019t trust the president to enforce the law.\u201dRyan is right."}
