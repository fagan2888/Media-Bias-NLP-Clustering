But one woman who borrowed her best friend\u2019s makeup brush didn\u2019t realize that it would have such devastating consequences for her.\n\nJo Gilchrist, a young mother of a 2-year-old son, was paralyzed completely after developing a staph infection that attacked her spine. She believes it was passed along through the brush and the microbes might have entered her system through a pimple on her face.\n\nTypically, about a third of healthy people have harmless staphylococcus bacteria living on their skin. But a very small proportion of people (about two percent) carry an antibiotic-resistant version. It\u2019s possible that since Gilchrist\u2019s friend had previously had a staph infection on her face, it had been transferred to Gilchrist through the makeup brush and her own immune system wasn\u2019t able to fight it off. The particular strain of staph that attacked her spine was MRSA (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus).\n\n\u201cThe only thing we can put it down to is the makeup brush,\u201d Gilchrist, 27, told The Daily Mail Australia. \u201cMy friend did have a staph infection on her face and I was using her brush just before. I had no idea that could even happen, I used to share with my friends all the time.\u201d\n\nGilchrist initially felt a \u201clittle ache\u201d that quickly turned into back and full body pain that was \u201cworse than childbirth.\u201d She noted, \u201cI literally thought I was going to die.\u201d Soon, the feeling in her legs began to go numb and she knew something was terribly wrong.\n\nAfter being airlifted to the hospital, doctors began trying to figure out what was causing the numbness and paralysis. They placed her in an induced coma and started emergency surgery. The staph infection, however, had already destroyed her spine and left her unable to walk, as well as unable to control her bowel or bladder function.\n\nGilchrist, despite this devastating setback, remains positive about her life and believes that with the proper attitude to not give up, she will walk again someday. She\u2019s been in intensive treatment and therapy, and with the help of physical therapy she\u2019s been able to slowly move her legs and stand. In a new video she uploaded to her Facebook, Gilchrist shows herself fighting the paralysis by moving around and standing.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fighting this with all I\u2019ve got and I\u2019m starting to learn to walk again,\u201d she told the Daily Mail. \u201cTwo weeks ago they said I might be able to walk for an hour or two a day \u2014 like grocery shopping, washing up, and hanging the washing out. I\u2019m happy with that. I honestly didn\u2019t even expect that.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "paralyzed, makeup brush, staph infection, mrsa", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Jo Gilchrist suffered horrible pain and numbness in her legs after borrowing a makeup brush from her friend, which seemed to transmit an antibiotic-resistant strain of staph and paralyze her legs.", "title": "Woman Paralyzed After Borrowed Makeup Brush Transmits Staph Infection", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/mrsa-bacteria-borrowed-makeup-brush-paralyzes-27-year-old-woman-328836", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/10/wheelchair.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Jo Gilchrist suffered horrible pain and numbness in her legs after borrowing a makeup brush from her friend, which seemed to transmit an antibiotic-resistant strain of staph and paralyze her legs.", "title": "Woman Paralyzed After Borrowed Makeup Brush Transmits Staph Infection", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/mrsa-bacteria-borrowed-makeup-brush-paralyzes-27-year-old-woman-328836", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/10/wheelchair.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/10/wheelchair.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-04-10T16:20:22-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-10T16:20:21-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Jo Gilchrist suffered horrible pain and numbness in her legs after borrowing a makeup brush from her friend, which seemed to transmit an antibiotic-resistant strain of staph and paralyze her legs."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd34a0\"", "article_summary": "But one woman who borrowed her best friend\u2019s makeup brush didn\u2019t realize that it would have such devastating consequences for her.\n\u201cThe only thing we can put it down to is the makeup brush,\u201d Gilchrist, 27, told The Daily Mail Australia.\n\u201cMy friend did have a staph infection on her face and I was using her brush just before.\nJo Gilchrist, a young mother of a 2-year-old son, was paralyzed completely after developing a staph infection that attacked her spine.\nYou\u2019ve probably borrowed your best friend\u2019s hair brush, or shared their drinks and clothes."}
