Photo provided by Humboldt County Department of Health and Human Services\n\nA new partnership between Humboldt County\u2019s Department of Health and Human Services and the Eureka Police Department aims to strike a better balance between enforcement and care when it comes to the city\u2019s severely mentally challenged homeless.\n\nThe Mobile Intervention and Services Team (MIST), which began working this week, pairs a Eureka Police Officer and a licensed DHHS clinician together to proactively engage homeless people who are suffering from severe mental illness, assess what kind of help they might need, and refer them to available services or help them find immediate assistance \u2014 should the individual choose to accept such help, according to a DHHS press release. Then the third member of the team, a DHHS mental health case manager, follows up with the individual and helps to further assess needs and provide continued care.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s building on what we\u2019re beginning to understand about the populations of homeless in the city of Eureka and we\u2019re using the team as an on-the-ground effort to get a better idea about who these individuals are and what their needs might be,\u201d DHHS Director Phillip Crandall said. \u201cIt\u2019s an investigative team and the idea is to initially work with the homeless that seem to be struggling due to a mental illness and are more likely to be preyed upon by other people.\u201d\n\nThe team, which patrols certain areas of the Eureka about 16 hours a week, is a departure from the current model of enforcement, EPD Capt. Steve Watson said.\n\nWatson, who helps to oversee the program, said that prior to MIST, police officers typically responding to calls regarding an individual who appeared to be mentally ill or abusing substances or both were frequently put in the position of having to determine if that person would be best served by a trip to either the Humboldt County jail or Sempervirens Psychiatric Health Facility. With the new team, which combines the on-the-ground familiarity and authority of law enforcement with the mental health expertise of a DHHS clinician, the determination is more accurate and the range of possible treatments expanded, before the complaint call even comes in, Watson said.\n\n\u201cThose emergency options are still available, but now there are more options,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s going to change is the hand-off and follow-up. And that\u2019s something where law enforcement has been weak \u2014 you have an intervention in the field that results in incarceration or at the psychiatric health facility and that\u2019s the end. We walk away and aren\u2019t so much involved in the process afterward \u2014 the left hand wasn\u2019t working with the right hand so smoothly. Now that we\u2019ll be working side by side with mental health services, the communication will be better and the effort will be more focused.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe improvements have already begun, according to Kelly Johnson, a DHHS mental health clinician. Johnson, who started going out on patrol with EPD Officer Louis Altic on Monday, said the duo has already encountered and engaged with several people the program was created for.\n\n\u201c(Friday) was our fourth time out, and you know, it\u2019s actually been pretty successful,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cWe\u2019ve made contact with multiple people that have been on DHHS and EPD\u2019s radar \u2014 folks that have fallen through the cracks and haven\u2019t been able to access services or receive follow-up services.\u201d\n\nSince the engagement is proactive, Johnson noted, meaning that it takes place before a complaint call is received or a crime is committed, homeless individuals can choose whether or not to accept help. She said that thus far reaction has been positive, partially because of the combination of services that the team brings.\n\n\u201cMost people have been pretty receptive,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI have the feeling that when you\u2019re with a law enforcement officer people are more likely to talk to you. We\u2019re clear with people that they\u2019re not in trouble and they\u2019re free to go at any time, but having someone in a uniform with you allows access to people who maybe wouldn\u2019t be as likely to respond to a mental health professional.\u201d\n\nFor instance, Johnson pointed to a man the team was able to help on Friday \u2014 after a few days of making contact with him and building trust beforehand \u2014 by finding him temporary housing for 10 days and also be put in contact with the team\u2019s DHHS case manager, Moonie Higginson.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t press too hard,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI\u2019m coming from a social work perspective where I believe that if I\u2019m forcing someone to do something it won\u2019t be successful. Right now I\u2019m building relationships and trust, and I think that\u2019s the best way to help.\u201d\n\nTemporary housing wasn\u2019t the optimal solution for that individual \u2014 \u201cHe needs housing that\u2019s more permanent,\u201d she said \u2014 but it\u2019s preferred to what might have happened otherwise \u2014 arrest, incarceration and then back on the streets. And more permanent solutions in regard to housing goes is in the future, Crandall said, along with possible expansion of the program if it\u2019s successful.\n\nNow that new funding has been made available through the Affordable Care Act and the Mental Heatlh Services Act, Crandall said DHHS is shooting to have the Multiple Assistance Center and an intake-assessment unit available to serve single individuals and their housing needs by summertime, but for the time being the Mobile Intervention and Services Team is a step in the right direction.\n\n\u201cThe first step is to form the core team \u2014 the law enforcement mental health team \u2014 and to hit the streets and see what we learn based on the expanded services and support that team will offer,\u201d Crandall said. \u201cThen in the future we can connect that with the intake and assessment capacity at the MAC and hopefully we\u2019ll have the ability to assess and stabilize and then connect with other providers in the community.\u201d\n\nContact Aaron West at 707-441-0509.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new partnership between Humboldt County\u2019s Department of Health and Human Services and the Eureka Police Department aims to strike a better balance between enforcement and care when it comes to the city\u2019s severely mentally challenged ho", "title": "New mental health-law enforcement team hits the streets", "og": {"url": "http://www.times-standard.com/article/NJ/20150117/NEWS/150119881", "image": {"width": "1500px", "identifier": "http://www.times-standard.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/NJ/20150117/NEWS/150119881/AR/0/AR-150119881.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "1000px"}, "type": "article", "title": "New mental health-law enforcement team hits the streets"}, "twitter": {"domain": "times-standard.com", "description": "A new partnership between Humboldt County\u2019s Department of Health and Human Services and the Eureka Police Department aims to strike a better balance between enforcement and care when it comes to the city\u2019s severely mentally challenged ho", "title": "New mental health-law enforcement team hits the streets", "url": "http://www.times-standard.com/article/NJ/20150117/NEWS/150119881", "image": {"src": "http://www.times-standard.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/NJ/20150117/NEWS/150119881/AR/0/AR-150119881.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@eurekaTS", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id551779828?mt=8", "iphone": "id499669816?mt=8", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.californianewspaperpartnership.eurekatimesstandard"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "News, Eureka news, CA news, US news, world news.", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "News, Eureka news, CA news, US news, world news."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0551\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe first step is to form the core team \u2014 the law enforcement mental health team \u2014 and to hit the streets and see what we learn based on the expanded services and support that team will offer,\u201d Crandall said.\nThen the third member of the team, a DHHS mental health case manager, follows up with the individual and helps to further assess needs and provide continued care.\nNow that we\u2019ll be working side by side with mental health services, the communication will be better and the effort will be more focused.\u201dAdvertisementThe improvements have already begun, according to Kelly Johnson, a DHHS mental health clinician.\nShe said that thus far reaction has been positive, partially because of the combination of services that the team brings.\n\u201cI have the feeling that when you\u2019re with a law enforcement officer people are more likely to talk to you."}
