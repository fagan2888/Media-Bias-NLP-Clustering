When they arrived, someone besides Hardwell answered the door and was holding an infant. They also saw another child and heard other children's voices coming from inside the home. But the person who answered said no day care children were there and that she would not allow a survey of the home.\n\nAfter calling police, the surveyors were allowed to enter. Inside they found the operator of the daycare and numerous children under their care.\n\nHardwell told the surveyors the day care was closed for the day, but they found 12 children currently under her care including 10 in the basement - which per a fire inspection was not approved for use. The number of children also exceeded the number allowed by her temporary permit.\n\nThe order also said the operator was \"not tending to the needs of the children in care and was not aware at all times of the location and activity of the children.\"\n\nRecords for other adults in the home had also not been submitted to the KDHE.\n\nThe order can be appealed.
