Tucson Police say a young man was behind the wheel when he crossed the gore zone to get to the Pantano exit and lost control of his car.\n\nThe crash involved just one occupant in one vehicle that crashed into a light pole, said Sgt. Pete Dugan, TPD spokesman. TPD says the man was not wearing a seatbelt and speed and alcohol do not appear to have been factors in the accident.\n\nThe man died at the scene. Investigators are waiting to release his identity until after next of kin is informed.\n\nCopyright 2015 Tucson News Now.
