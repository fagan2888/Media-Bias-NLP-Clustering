In November 2014, Maynard, 29, chose to end her life after moving to Oregon to take advantage of the state\u2019s aid-in-dying law.\n\nNational conversation on the right to die decades in the making\n\nIt was not Maynard or her family who widely shared the video that attracted national attention to the issue of aid-in-dying legislation. Maynard reached out to Compassion & Choices, said Toni Broaddus, California campaign director for the organization. The nonprofit is dedicated to passing aid-in-dying legislation in California and nationally, and promoted Maynard\u2019s video, organized primetime interviews, perpetuated a national conversation and continued to share her story after her death.Compassion & Choices and other such organizations have taken advantage of the latest digital technologies to bolster the conversation about the right to die.\u201cIt\u2019s clear that social media is the reason this issue has gained so much momentum so quickly because it is now possible for a story like Brittany\u2019s to go global in just a matter of hours,\u201d Broaddus said. The latest campaign effort in the United States surrounding the aid-in-dying conversation was centered on a piece of legislation in California, Maynard\u2019s home state, which the state assembly passed on Sept. 11 after a months-long effort. Now, the legislation awaits final approval by the Senate, which passed it initially last spring. From there, it will go to Gov. Jerry Brown.Funding data for the legislative effort has been limited, but one thing is clear: nonprofit organizations were coordinating campaign efforts to market the conversation for and against the right to die. Organizations such as Compassion & Choices and Death with Dignity led the effort through educating and rallying the public to press legislators to pass Senate Bill 128. On the con side, organizations such as National Right to Life and the Disability Rights and Education Fund have voiced concerns in media and in legislative hearings over potential abuse of disabled and elderly patients and family members through the legalization of aid-in-dying.A team of Peninsula Press reporters at Stanford analyzed more than 25,000 tweets from April and May 2015 generated by nonprofit organizations, journalists and high-profile individuals around the world. The analysis found that, both nationally and internationally, it\u2019s established organizations that are most successful at generating retweets and consequently drawing more people into the right-to-die conversation.The Peninsula Press team also collected funding data for electoral campaigns on aid-in-dying legislation for 2008 and 2012, in Oregon and Massachusetts respectively. The data revealed national organizations are the leading contributors to these legislative efforts.\n\nT\n\nIn California, nonprofits invest in educating the public\n\nhe conversation around the right to die in the United States began decades ago in Oregon, the state to where Maynard was forced to move in order to take advantage of existing aid-in-dying laws.In 1994, Oregon voters, by a margin of 51-49 percent approved a Death With Dignity Act ballot initiative that would grant terminally ill patients the ability to request lethal medication. This initiative became law in 1997, allowing \u201cmentally competent, terminally ill adult state residents to voluntarily request and receive a prescription medication to hasten their death,\u201d according to the Death With Dignity National Center.More than a decade later, in 2007, California \u2014 Maynard\u2019s home state \u2014 considered its first right to die legislation. The legislation, however, was shut down. Some of the pushback came from arguments by religious groups who suggested that suicide is an immoral act. Others expressed concern that under such a law, relatives might pressure the sick into accepting the lethal medication, and that insurance companies might abuse the law.Washington state\u2019s Death With Dignity Act went into effect on March 5, 2009, and Vermont followed on May 20, 2013. After 2007, according to the Death With Dignity National Center, legislators in California did not seriously consider passing a right to die law \u2014 until Maynard.In April of 2014, Maynard was diagnosed with grade 4 astrocytoma, a brain tumor. Doctors gave her six months to live. Maynard moved from California to Oregon, where she would have a choice over how long she lived.\u201cThat\u2019s the strength of the legislation,\u201d said Dan Diaz, Maynard\u2019s widower in an interview in the spring. \u201cIt\u2019s up to the individual. There is no timeline, there is no requirement in that regard. The person who is terminally ill lives as long as they possibly can. I mean, that\u2019s always the goal\u201dAfter battling worsening seizures and other pain, Maynard chose to die on Nov. 1, 2014 in Oregon surrounded by friends and family.\u201cGoodbye to all my dear friends and family that I love,\u201d wrote Maynard in her final Facebook post. \u201cToday is the day I have chosen to pass away with dignity in the face of my terminal illness, this terrible brain cancer that has taken so much from me \u2026 but would have taken so much more.\u201d\n\nSenators Bill Monning and Lois Wolk, SB 128\u2019s sponsors, approached Compassion & Choices regarding the bill shortly after Maynard\u2019s death in November of last year. The senators officially introduced the bill in January 2015.\n\nWhat the opposition says\n\nThe nonprofit was caught slightly off-guard when the senators first approached them; it marked the first time that legislators reached out to the nonprofit and not the other way around. Compassion & Choices was not planning to go to the Legislature during 2015, Broaddus said. The nonprofit, however, was ready to seize the opportunity the senators presented them.The nonprofit, Broaddus said, had been involved in different attempts to pass aid-in-dying legislation in California. But after the failure to pass such legislation in 2007, the organization pulled away from the state to re-strategize and raise funding for a revised campaign.\u201cCalifornia is always in any social justice campaign. It\u2019s always a really important state,\u201d Broaddus said. \u201cIt tends to be one of the early adopters of social justice policies that make people\u2019s lives better, so there was always an attempt and understanding that we had to do something big in California.\u201dIn 2013, the group reinvested its national resources into the state, mainly focusing on educating the public about end-of-life options; political action was then an uncertainty. That focus on public education and discourse has been key, said Jennifer Glass in the spring, just months before her death of Stage 4 lung cancer. Glass, was a San Mateo resident who collaborated with Compassion & Choices to garner support for the legislation. Glass was diagnosed with a terminal cancer in 2013 and died in August, just a few weeks before the assembly passed the bill.In the spring, Glass said that efforts to pass aid-in-dying legislation in the past largely faltered due to social taboo over openly discussing such an issue.\u201cThe biggest impediment historically, I believe, has been people\u2019s fear of the conversation,\u201d Glass said at the time.But last year, with the appearance of Maynard\u2019s story, followed by the sudden support of Monning and Wolk, Compassion & Choices found itself in a position to once again campaign for aid-in-dying legislation in California.Beginning last November, the organization trained over 853 volunteers in California for the legislative effort, Broaddus said. Volunteers went to local markets and rotary clubs, talked to people about end of life options and urged voters to contact their legislators regarding passage of the bill. The organization also has offered terminally ill patients and their families end-of-life counseling services and has a legal team on hand to help terminally ill patients.For its part, the Oregon-based Death with Dignity National Center also invested resources in arranging speaking events in California with the goal of explaining end-of-life options, said George Eighmey, vice president of the organization.Compassion and Choices has also funded four different lobbying firms to help the bill move along.\u201cWe\u2019re investing a lot of financial resources into the people that we need to help make this bill move forward and make a change,\u201d Broaddus said in an interview in the spring.Broaddus could not provide an estimate of how much funding has gone towards the lobbying firms.Diaz said that organizations with established resources and know-how like Compassion & Choices are key to bringing thousands of individual stories to public attention. Diaz can\u2019t precisely say that his wife\u2019s widely shared video would have garnered that much attention without the publicity provided by Compassion & Choices, but he credits the nonprofit\u2019s influence.\u201cI guess it may have gotten a lot of initial attention but then maybe tapered off a bit more,\u201d Diaz said in the spring. \u201cWhereas because of Compassion & Choices and the media-savvy that they have, they\u2019ve been able to keep it, kind of the focus on it, and also utilize it at the appropriate times with legislators.\u201dMonths after his wife\u2019s passing, Diaz continued to collaborate with Compassion & Choices. He participated in speaking engagements and reached out to legislators, all the while sharing his family\u2019s story. For Diaz, it was a matter of personal advocacy. It also was a means by which he could keep his promise to his wife to work to get aid-in-dying legislation passed at least in their home state of California.\u201cIt\u2019s personal. That\u2019s the promise I made to Brittany,\u201d Diaz said.\n\nOrganizations such as Disability Rights Education & Defense Fund have spoken out against the passage of SB 128. DREDF had warned against the potential abuse of an aid-in-dying law, spreading its message through social media efforts, through articles in the media, and through educating California legislators on their position, said Senior Policy Analyst Marilyn Golden earlier this spring.\n\nThe bill moved forward with support from nonprofits\n\nGolden said in a spring interview that there have never been safeguards put into place to prevent abuse of aid-in-dying, especially relating to the elderly and the disabled. In Oregon, she added, there is no investigation of abuse and no way to report abuse. Oregon does not show abuse because the system is set up not to find it.\u201cWhere assisted suicide is legal, an heir or an abusive caregiver may steer the person toward assisted suicide, illegally witness their request, pick up the lethal dose for the ill person, and in the end they can even administer it, because no objective witnesses are required at the death,\u201d Golden said.Golden also commented on situations such as \u201cdoctor shopping\u201d where families shop around for doctors until they find one willing to assist in an individual\u2019s premature death, and misdiagnosis, that is a common occurrence in medicine, where an original diagnosis ends up changing with time, Golden said. If a person is misdiagnosed as terminally ill in a state where aid-in-dying is legal, this person may take advantage of the aid-in-dying law and miss out on potential treatments and good years of their life, Golden said.\u201cI object to calling this the right to die,\u201d Golden said. \u201cOur opposition is about the fact that where it\u2019s legal the Oregon model puts many people at dangerous risk of harm. Other people may call it a particular thing, we call it assisted suicide because that\u2019s the name they use in medical and in legal professions.\u201dDiaz, in addressing those who opposed the legislation, had one question.\u201cHow would they suggest that my wife die?\u201d Diaz asked.Golden spoke of one alternative to aid-in-dying, a form of sedation called \u201cpalliative sedation\u201d where the suffering patient is sedated to a point of comfort while the dying process takes place.\u201cFor people who are experiencing a painful death who could not be relieved otherwise,\u201d said Golden, \u201cit is legal in every state to get palliative sedation. That should not be dismissed as an alternative. We already have a solution that doesn\u2019t endanger people in the way the assisted suicide law would.\u201dGlass used palliative sedation in her final days, according to a report on the Compassion & Choices website. Her husband, Harlan Seymour, in that report, criticized the method as inadequate.\u201cJennifer underwent palliative sedation because her symptoms had become unbearable. She was unable to breathe and in enormous pain. Unfortunately, she was not able to take advantage of the end-of-life option \u2014 medical aid in dying \u2014 that she gave her precious time to make available,\u201d Seymour was quoted by Compassion & Choices.\n\nThe path to the Assembly passing the legislation on Sept. 11 was full of stops and starts. The bill passed the Senate Health Committee in March and the Senate Judiciary Committee in April. Then the Senate Appropriations Committee suspended the vote, putting the bill at risk to be killed in the committee. Eventually, the legislation passed to the Senate floor and then on June 4, the Senate passed it.\n\nOne of the key shifts in the legislation\u2019s likelihood for success came after theCalifornia Medical Association (CMA), a historic opponent to aid-in-dying legislation stated on May 20, that it was neutral on the passage of the legislation.\u201cThe decision to participate in the End of Life Option Act is a very personal one between a doctor and their patient,\u201d said CMA President Luther F. Cobb in a press release on the subject. \u201cWhich is why CMA has removed policy that outright objects to physicians aiding terminally ill patients in end of life options.\u201d\u201cTheir position of neutrality allows I think for senators to recognize that it\u2019s OK for this bill from an ethical standpoint, a moral standpoint, a logical standpoint to move forward,\u201d Diaz said in the spring.But then early in the summer, the bill didn\u2019t make it out of an Assembly health committee. At the time, news reports suggested the legislation would not be considered again until the next regular legislative session. In August, after Gov. Brown called a special session on healthcare spending, the bill was reintroduced.The governor\u2019s office had suggested that the special session was not the time to revisit the legislation and he has given little public indication of how he plans to deal with it, but Eighmey of Death with Dignity said in the spring that he was \u201ccautiously optimistic that the governor will sign it.\u201d\u201cHe has made comments in the past that would indicate he would be willing to pass this option as long as you ensure that individuals who are vulnerable don\u2019t take advantage of it,\u201d Eighmey said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Peninsula Press", "description": "The latest campaign effort in the United States surrounding the aid-in-dying conversation was centered on a piece of legislation in California, which the state assembly\u00a0passed on Sept. 11 after a months-long effort.", "title": "Campaigning for the right to die: Technology\u2019s influence on the aid-in-dying conversation - Peninsula Press", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://peninsulapress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/EKGLine.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-10-01T16:00:59+00:00", "url": "http://peninsulapress.com/2015/09/14/right-to-die-technology-influence/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PeninsuPress", "section": "Business + Tech", "tag": "right to die", "published_time": "2015-09-14T15:02:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-01T16:00:59+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "The latest campaign effort in the United States surrounding the aid-in-dying conversation was centered on a piece of legislation in California, which the state assembly\u00a0passed on Sept. 11 after a months-long effort.", "creator": "@PeninsuPress", "image": "http://peninsulapress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/EKGLine.jpg", "title": "Campaigning for the right to die: Technology\u2019s influence on the aid-in-dying conversation - Peninsula Press", "site": "@PeninsuPress", "card": "summary"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.2.4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc999\"", "article_summary": "National conversation on the right to die decades in the makingIt was not Maynard or her family who widely shared the video that attracted national attention to the issue of aid-in-dying legislation.\nCompassion & Choices was not planning to go to the Legislature during 2015, Broaddus said.\nMaynard reached out to Compassion & Choices, said Toni Broaddus, California campaign director for the organization.\n\u201cWhereas because of Compassion & Choices and the media-savvy that they have, they\u2019ve been able to keep it, kind of the focus on it, and also utilize it at the appropriate times with legislators.\u201dMonths after his wife\u2019s passing, Diaz continued to collaborate with Compassion & Choices.\nThe nonprofit, however, was ready to seize the opportunity the senators presented them.The nonprofit, Broaddus said, had been involved in different attempts to pass aid-in-dying legislation in California."}
