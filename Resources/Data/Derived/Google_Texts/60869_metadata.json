Chabot was joined by one other navigator at the fair, Eireann Aspell, 25, of Derry, who said she was also able to reach nine consumers.\n\nAspell and Chabot counted family members of those who enrolled, who may not have been at the fair but will still be covered under a relative\u2019s plan, in the total number of consumers reached.\n\nChabot said she became a navigator because of her belief that \u201cpeople should have access to health insurance regardless of income.\u201d\n\n\u201cPreventative health care will bring down the cost of health care overall and help people catch things early,\u201d Chabot said. \u201cIt improves the quality of people\u2019s lives and it improves the health care system.\u201d\n\nChabot also expressed her hope that New Hampshire\u2019s legislative body will expand Medicaid protection. According to the State Employees\u2019 Association of New Hampshire, expanded Medicaid would make an additional 58,000 consumers eligible for the lowest premiums under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cFrom the bottom of my heart, I hope it gets expanded,\u201d Chabot said. \u201cEveryone needs an option that works for them.\u201d\n\nChabot\u2019s sentiments were echoed by John Thyng, a member of the State Employees\u2019 Association of New Hampshire, who worked the sign-in desk at the fair. Thyng said he has had to tell several people looking for coverage that they are \u201ctoo poor\u201d to be eligible for the Affordable Care Act\u2019s lowest premiums because they also qualify for expanded Medicaid.\n\nA Supreme Court decision that ruled Obamacare as constitutional also ruled states have the right to decide whether to participate in expanded Medicaid.\n\nNew Hampshire has yet to accept federal funds for expanded Medicaid.\n\nEven so, Thyng said he was encouraged by Saturday\u2019s turnout at the fair, and he said he believes better health insurance coverage will specifically benefit many of the state\u2019s government employees.\n\n\u201cOne of the reasons this is so important is there are thousands of part-time state employees without the ability to get employer coverage,\u201d Thyng said, adding that part-time employees do not have access to the same level of health insurance coverage as full-timers.\n\nVictoria Chesterley, an adjunct professor at Nashua Community College, was one of those part-time state employees. She chose to sign up for Obamacare with her husband, Mark Gaydos, at the fair.\n\n\u201cThe navigators were very helpful,\u201d Chesterley said. \u201cMy husband had trouble logging in (to healthcare.gov) earlier in the week, but today went very smoothly.\u201d\n\nChesterley\u2019s husband, Mark Gaydos, said he was excited to have access to cheaper health care, but said he questions why so many oppose Obamacare.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve done a lot of headscratching about that,\u201d Gaydos said. \u201cI struggle to see the downside of having people covered.\u201d\n\nObamacare navigators at the fair said most enrollments take anywhere between 30 minutes and two hours, and pointed out that longer enrollment times are usually attributed to those signing up with larger families.\n\nThe enrollment period for Obamacare will last until March 31, and those wishing to have health care coverage under the Affordable Care Act by Jan. 1 have until Dec. 14 to enroll.\n\nBradford Randall can be reached at 594-6557 or bhrandall@nashua\n\ntelegraph.com.
