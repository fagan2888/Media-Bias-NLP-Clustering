Ted Cruz said he would \u201cutterly destroy\u201d and \u201ccarpet bomb\u201d ISIS, while Sen. Marco Rubio said Obama \u201ceither refuses to deal with the issue in front of him or is just overwhelmed by it.\u201d\n\nDown the ballot, Republican senators up for re-election were equally critical of Obama\u2019s remarks and overall strategy.\n\nRon Johnson of Wisconsin called the address \u201cnothing new\u201d and \u201cvery disappointing\u201d; Mark Kirk of Illinois said Obama was \u201cdoubling down on failed strategies\u201d; and Rob Portman of Ohio called the strategy \u201cfundamentally flawed.\u201d\n\nIn terms of next year\u2019s Senate elections, Republicans think that the increased attention being paid to national security will benefit their party.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s no question that when the public\u2019s attention is on national security, that we\u2019re operating in a Republican territory,\u201d said Brian Walsh, a former communications director for the National Republican Senatorial Committee. He added that Democrats would prefer focusing on domestic issues, but that \u201cthere\u2019s no question that [national security] will be an issue Republicans will want to talk about in 2016 in terms of which party is best equipped to keep the country safe.\u201d\n\nWalsh did admit, however, that Republicans attempting to highlight this issue ran into trouble when Donald Trump called for a ban on Muslims entering the United States. The same GOP senators who criticized Obama\u2019s strategy early in the week spent the following days responding to Trump\u2019s proposal and answering questions about their potential support for the GOP frontrunner.\n\n\u201cInstead of having a real debate over [ISIS strategy], the public\u2019s attention has shifted to Trump\u2019s inflammatory rhetoric on Muslims,\u201d Walsh said.\n\nWhile Republicans have long seen national security as a winning issue for the party, Obama has often gotten high favorability ratings in this area. In 2011, several months after the killing of Osama bin Laden, a poll showed that six in 10 Americans approved of the way he was handling terrorism. Following rise of ISIS and the Paris and San Bernardino attacks, however, those numbers have flipped. In a poll earlier this week, six in 10 did not approve of the way Obama is handling terrorism, and 64 percent didn\u2019t approve of his handling of ISIS.\n\nAlleigh Marre, a spokeswoman for the NRSC, said that Americans\u2019 fears are more \u201ctangible\u201d after multiple attacks against the West.\n\n\u201cI think voters are really going to go to people that they trust, and the Obama/ Clinton administration or school of thought on foreign policy is what got us to where we are,\u201d Marre said. \u201cI think the gut reaction is going to be wary of and reject where the Democrats are coming from.\"\n\nDemocrats, however, don\u2019t plan to simply play defense on this issue. Along with trying to tie other Republicans to Trump, there are several issues related to the fight against ISIS that Democrats see as weaknesses for Republicans, including the GOP desire to pause or halt the flow of Syrian refugees coming to the U.S. and their votes against Democratic efforts to ban people on the terrorism watch list from purchasing guns. (All GOP senators except Kirk voted against Democrats\u2019 gun amendment to a bill repealing the Affordable Care Act).\n\n\u201cIn the last week, Republican senators facing tough re-elections voted to allow suspected terrorists to purchase guns and would still support a potential presidential nominee whose dangerous plan has been dismissed by experts as a national security risk,\u201d said Lauren Passalacqua, a spokeswoman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. \u201cThese aren\u2019t the kind of decisions you make if you\u2019re fully committed to protecting Americans.\u201d\n\nJohnson, who is in a rematch against former Sen. Russ Feingold, the man he unseated in 2010, is the chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, a position that gives him a powerful perch to discuss ISIS strategy, including holding a hearing Wednesday on potential changes to the visa waiver program meant to help prevent terrorists from entering the United States.\n\n\u201cJust take a look at the events on the ground. ISIS has not really lost much territory. We've maybe confined it in terms of territorial aspirations. But, you know, it continues to inspire. It continues to grow,\u201d Johnson said in an interview with NPR earlier this week. \u201cAs long as ISIS is not overtly losing, they'll continue to be perceived as winners.\u201d\n\nNew Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte, who is facing Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan in her re-election race, has similarly been outspoken on national security issues and questioned Defense Secretary Ashton Carter Wednesday on the administration\u2019s strategy during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing. She pressed Carter on why the administration delayed going after fuel trucks with airstrikes and pushed for more embedded operatives on the ground to direct those strikes. Ayotte told RCP she expects terrorism and defense to be a major factor in next year\u2019s election.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s on the top of people\u2019s minds,\u201d she said. \u201cWithout security you can\u2019t have prosperity; without security you can\u2019t have freedom and so I think people inherently understand that we need to keep the country safe and that\u2019s obviously going to be a foremost concern for my constituents in light of both what\u2019s happening around the world and in the United States.\"\n\nCorry Bliss, campaign manager for Portman, similarly said that national security would be a key issue in the Ohio Senate race against former Gov. Ted Strickland, and threw a jab at Strickland\u2019s support earlier this year for the president\u2019s nuclear agreement with Iran.\n\n\u201cNational security will be one of the defining issues of this election cycle. When it comes to national security, it would be hard to find a more out of touch candidate than Ted Strickland,\u201d Bliss told RCP in a statement.\n\nJenny Donohue, a spokeswoman for the Ohio Democratic party, responded by criticizing Portman\u2019s vote on the terrorism watch list and guns, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s shocking Senator Portman would talk about national security judgment after he voted to let potential terrorists buy guns just last week.\"\n\nIn Illinois, the issue that separates Kirk from the frontrunner in the Democratic race against him, Rep. Tammy Duckworth, is Syrian refugees. In the wake of the Paris attacks, Duckworth called for increasing the number of refugees coming to the U.S. while Kirk called for a pause until there could be 100 percent certainty they aren\u2019t a security risk. Kirk\u2019s campaign released an ad last week referencing the Paris attacks and criticizing Duckworth\u2019s refugee stance as dangerous, while the Duckworth campaign accused Kirk of being \u201cdriven by fear and willing to compromise American values.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republicans have been rallying against President Obama\u2019s strategy in the war against ISIS for months but recent events have heightened the GOP war cry.\nIn particular, presidential contenders...", "title": "GOP Raises Its War Cry, Sees Winning Issue in '16 | RealClearPolitics", "fragment": "!", "twitter": {"site": "@RealClearNews", "card": "summary"}, "og": {"url": "http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2015/12/11/gop_raises_its_war_cry_sees_winning_issue_in_16_128996.html", "image": "http://images.rcp.realclearpolitics.com/334937_5_.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Republicans have been rallying against President Obama\u2019s strategy in the war against ISIS for months but recent events have heightened the GOP war cry.\nIn particular, presidential contenders...", "title": "GOP Raises Its War Cry, Sees Winning Issue in '16 | RealClearPolitics"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1415921935346245}, "tweetmeme-title": "GOP Raises Its War Cry, Sees Winning Issue in '16 | RealClearPolitics", "keywords": "Ron Johnson,kelly ayotte,Rob Portman,Mark Kirk,GOP,san bernardino shooting,ISIS,"}, "article_summary": "\u201cInstead of having a real debate over [ISIS strategy], the public\u2019s attention has shifted to Trump\u2019s inflammatory rhetoric on Muslims,\u201d Walsh said.\nRepublicans have been rallying against President Obama\u2019s strategy in the war against ISIS for months but recent events have heightened the GOP war cry.\nWhile Republicans have long seen national security as a winning issue for the party, Obama has often gotten high favorability ratings in this area.\n\u201cNational security will be one of the defining issues of this election cycle.\nCorry Bliss, campaign manager for Portman, similarly said that national security would be a key issue in the Ohio Senate race against former Gov."}
