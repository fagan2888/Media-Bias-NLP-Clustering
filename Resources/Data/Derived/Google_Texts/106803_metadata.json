But it is. Studies show that if you have HIV, the harmful effects of smoking are greatly magnified, even when the disease appears to be under control with medication.\n\nAnti-smoking advocates wonder, with HIV now very manageable with antiretroviral drugs, why would anyone jeopardize their health by smoking? Why not just kick the smoking habit for good?\n\nIt\u2019s easier said than done, especially since smoking is so entrenched in many niche communities of people with HIV. That\u2019s why the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are urging people with HIV to quit, using the story of an HIV-positive man named \u201cBrian\u201d to get their message across.\n\nHit By a Stroke After Rebounding from HIV\n\nBrian is one of many real people used in the CDC\u2019s \u201cTips from Former Smokers\u201d campaign. HIV was recently added to agency's list of chronic conditions to target with anti-smoking messages, including asthma, cancer, COPD, and cardiovascular disease. Pregnant women are also included in the social media push.\n\nPregnancy and Smoking: Why You Need to Quit \u00bb\n\nBrian, 43, wound up in the hospital after being diagnosed with HIV. But soon, doctors had his disease under control. He rebounded, went back to work, and began to feel \u201cinvincible.\u201d Quitting his three decade smoking habit was hardly a priority.\n\nThen Brian had a stroke and nearly lost his life.\n\n\u201cWe know from a large surveillance project running here that the prevalence of smoking among people with HIV in care is about 42 percent,\u201d said Dr. John T. Brooks, an HIV specialist with the CDC.\n\nThat is twice the national average of 21 percent, Brooks told Healthline. \u201cSmoking does impair CD4 cells in a way that can be bad for you,\" he said. \"It increases the risk of certain pneumonias, for example.\u201d\n\nCD4 T-cells, or \u201chelper cells,\u201d help the body fight infections like pneumonia. Pneumonia remains a leading cause of death among people who progress from HIV to AIDS. The level of CD4 cells in a person's body is a good indicator of whether their HIV is under control.\n\nRecent studies also point to the role of inflammation in people with HIV. \u201cJust having an HIV infection produces a chronic state of inflammation,\u201d Brooks said.\n\nInflammation is already linked to other conditions that affect smokers, such as heart disease, lung disease, certain cancers, and low bone density and fragility fractures. \u201cIf you have HIV and smoke, you\u2019re getting hit from both directions with this inflammatory problem,\u201d Brooks said.\n\nJust How Dangerous Is Smoking If You\u2019re HIV-Positive?\n\nIt\u2019s well established that smoking can cause an early death, and HIV can too. But combine the two, and the deadly punch is much more powerful.\n\nIn fact, in a Danish study in which patients got top-of-the-line HIV care including free antiretroviral medication, HIV-positive smokers lost more years of life from smoking than from HIV.\n\nIn the study, a person with HIV lost five years of life to the disease. A smoker without HIV lost almost four years of life to smoking. But a person with HIV who also smoked lost a total of 12 years of life, not nine, as one might think.\n\n\"If a person's HIV is under control, the risk of smoking remains and becomes a greater and often leading preventable risk for illness and death,\" Brooks said.\n\nReady to Quit? Here's How \u00bb\n\nWhy Do So Many People with HIV Smoke?\n\nPeople with HIV are often part of demographic groups that have especially high rates of smoking, namely gay men and African-Americans.\n\nPeople with HIV in the U.S. also tend to have less formal education and to come from poorer family backgrounds, Brooks said. They may also have issues related to substance abuse or mental illness. These factors are also linked to higher rates of smoking.\n\nThe smoking rate among gays and bisexuals in the U.S. last year was 27.7 percent, according to the CDC. That is compared to 17.3 percent among heterosexuals.\n\nThis can partly be blamed on aggressive marketing by the tobacco industry. In fact, when the pioneering HIV advocacy group ACT-UP boycotted Philip Morris in 1990, the tobacco giant won gay customers back by pledging large sums of money to fight AIDS.\n\nTimeline: What Happens When You Quit Smoking? \u00bb\n\nHIV Patients Want to Quit\n\nSurveys have shown that two-thirds of people with HIV who smoke want to quit, according to AIDS.gov. But it is a difficult habit for anyone to kick.\n\nBrooks said doctors can help by initiating conversations with their patients about quitting. The problem is that HIV specialists usually are not trained to provide that kind of care.\n\n\"If a person's HIV is under control, the risk of smoking remains and becomes a greater and often leading preventable risk for illness and death.\" \u2014 Dr. John Brooks\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is currently a shift, however, toward people with HIV getting care from doctors in family and general practice. While the move toward primary care providers has some HIV experts concerned about the care patients will receive, in some ways it could be beneficial.\n\n\u201cSmoking cessation is a cornerstone of their training,\u201d Brooks said of primary care doctors. \u201cNow they can be in a care setting where providers pay a lot more attention with the other things in your life.\u201d\n\nCare from a primary care physician always can be \u201cbacked up by a specialist when things get tough,\u201d Brooks added.\n\nBrooks hopes more doctors who treat people with HIV will start to provide smoking cessation counseling. He encouraged them to look into levels of reimbursement for these services.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act requires insurance providers who sell plans on state and federal exchange websites to offer smoking cessation counseling without any out-of-pocket co-payment from the patient.\n\nRead More: ACA Brings Mental Health, Substance Abuse Treatment to Millions \u00bb\n\nCDC Program Drives Smokers to Quit\n\nThe good news is that the CDC\u2019s \u201cTips from Former Smokers\u201d campaign is working.\n\nA paper published last year in The Lancet found that after only 12 weeks of the campaign, an estimated 1.64 million Americans had tried to quit, with an estimated 100,000 presumed successful. About 6 million non-smokers also talked to friends and family about the dangers of smoking.\n\nCalls to the CDC\u2019s 1-800-QUIT-NOW hotline rose by 75 percent during the 2013 \"Tips\" campaign, and visits to the website increased 38-fold.\n\nBrooks said that with few exceptions, most smoking cessation medications do not interact with antiretroviral therapy. He concedes that people with HIV are under a lot of stress, which makes quitting smoking even more difficult.\n\nBut he remains hopeful. \u201cThey may say, \u2018This is the only way I can release my stress, it\u2019s my last bad habit,\u2019\" Brooks said. \"But it\u2019s not an argument that\u2019s hard to win when you remind them of the damage smoking is doing to them.\u201d\n\nStar Power: Celebrities Who Quit Smoking \u00bb", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "smoking, HIV, smoker, smokers, AIDS, pneumonia, Tips from Smokers, CDC, AIDS.gov, addiction, nicotine, tobacco", "og": {"site_name": "Healthline", "description": "Smokers with HIV lose more years of life to cigarettes than to the disease itself, a new study shows.", "title": "Why HIV Patients Must Stop Smoking", "url": "http://www.healthline.com/health-news/why-hiv-patients-must-stop-smoking-080914", "image": "http://www.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/hiv/hivandsmoking.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/hiv/hivandsmoking.jpg", "description": "Smokers with HIV lose more years of life to cigarettes than to the disease itself, a new study shows.", "card": "summary", "title": "Why HIV Patients Must Stop Smoking"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP", "DC.date.issued": "2014-08-08", "fb": {"app_id": 239371929577489}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Smokers with HIV lose more years of life to cigarettes than to the disease itself, a new study shows."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd22cf\"", "article_summary": "In fact, in a Danish study in which patients got top-of-the-line HIV care including free antiretroviral medication, HIV-positive smokers lost more years of life from smoking than from HIV.\n\"But it\u2019s not an argument that\u2019s hard to win when you remind them of the damage smoking is doing to them.\u201dStar Power: Celebrities Who Quit Smoking \u00bb\n\u00bbHIV Patients Want to QuitSurveys have shown that two-thirds of people with HIV who smoke want to quit, according to AIDS.gov.\nA smoker without HIV lost almost four years of life to smoking.\nPregnancy and Smoking: Why You Need to Quit \u00bbBrian, 43, wound up in the hospital after being diagnosed with HIV."}
