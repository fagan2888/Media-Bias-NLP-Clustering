Robach\u2019s hectic job schedule kept her from getting tested earlier.\n\nRobach put off the mammogram for over a year. \u201cBetween flying all over the world for work and running around with my kids to school, and ballet, and gymnastics like so many women, I just kept pushing it off \u2014 until now,\u201d said Robach. A much longer wait might have complicated her path to recovery.\n\nNonetheless, some younger women who aren\u2019t as financially secure as Robach regularly put off getting mammograms, according to a recent study by researchers at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota. Nearly one in five surveyed women younger than 40 who had self-identified breast abnormalities waited at least three months before seeing a doctor, and 12 percent of these women experienced a three-month lapse before getting an official breast cancer diagnosis.\n\nThe common thread among the women who put off receiving care? Costs.\n\n\u201cThe findings may lead to research focusing on whether reducing co-pays and hidden costs of seeking medical care \u2014 such as parking charges, child-care expenses and lost wages \u2014 may improve the timeliness of diagnosis in this population,\u201d said lead study author Dr. Kathryn Ruddy.\n\nObamacare helps address the co-pay part of the equation. Recommended preventative care services such as mammograms and Pap smears must be provided for free under the health law. But women who go in for mammograms should make sure that their doctors understand the hospital visit is for purely preventative care, since some confused doctors are still charging Americans for preventative services that should now be free.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Even after they've self-identified a suspicious lump on their breasts, many American women put off getting a mammogram because it's hard for them to afford a trip to the doctor.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Even after they've self-identified a suspicious lump on their breasts, many American women put off getting a mammogram because it's hard for them to afford a trip to the doctor.", "title": "Younger, Poorer Women Are More Likely To Put Off Getting Mammograms", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2013/11/12/2925351/amy-robach-mammogram/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/apimages_amy-robach-mammogram.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Even after they've self-identified a suspicious lump on their breasts, many American women put off getting a mammogram because it's hard for them to afford a trip to the doctor.", "title": "Younger, Poorer Women Are More Likely To Put Off Getting Mammograms", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/apimages_amy-robach-mammogram-321x214.jpg", "creator": "@the_sy_guy", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/apimages_amy-robach-mammogram.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/apimages_amy-robach-mammogram.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-12T12:57:52+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0a35\"", "article_summary": "Nonetheless, some younger women who aren\u2019t as financially secure as Robach regularly put off getting mammograms, according to a recent study by researchers at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota.\nRecommended preventative care services such as mammograms and Pap smears must be provided for free under the health law.\nNearly one in five surveyed women younger than 40 who had self-identified breast abnormalities waited at least three months before seeing a doctor, and 12 percent of these women experienced a three-month lapse before getting an official breast cancer diagnosis.\nBut women who go in for mammograms should make sure that their doctors understand the hospital visit is for purely preventative care, since some confused doctors are still charging Americans for preventative services that should now be free.\nHealth Younger, Poorer Women Are More Likely To Put Off Getting Mammograms CREDIT: AP Photo/ABC, Ida Mae Astute Good Morning America correspondent Amy Robach gets an on-air mammogram in OctoberOn Monday, ABC News correspondent Amy Robach revealed that she has been diagnosed with breast cancer a month after reluctantly agreeing to an on-air mammogram on Good Morning America."}
