Taylor Ingraham, a spokesman for the New York-based Glenview at ASC Advisors, declined to comment on the losses.\n\nGlenview, which wagers on and against stocks, has been reaping gains on investments in health-care companies for years. Those investments propelled the hedge fund to returns of 43 percent in 2013. Glenview was also among the big winners following a Supreme Court decision in June that upheld a key piece of President Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act.\n\nHealth-care stocks have slid since the summer, with the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Health Care Sector Index falling 14 percent since hitting a high on July 20. The index has fallen 3 percent year-to-date.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Simone Foxman", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-06/robbins-s-glenview-said-to-lose-12-in-september-on-health-care", "title": "Glenview Fund Said to Lose 12% Last Month on Health Care", "site": "@business", "card": "summary", "description": "Glenview Capital Management, the hedge fund firm led by Larry Robbins, lost 12.4 percent in its main fund in September as bets on health-care companies suffered."}, "parsely-author": "Simone Foxman", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "Health", "news_keywords": "Health", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-06/robbins-s-glenview-said-to-lose-12-in-september-on-health-care", "parsely-title": "Glenview Fund Said to Lose 12% Last Month on Health Care", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff0000", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-10-06T17:11:05.865Z", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "Glenview Capital Management, the hedge fund firm led by Larry Robbins, lost 12.4 percent in its main fund in September as bets on health-care companies suffered.", "parsely-tags": "Health,Region: Global,Page: article", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.bwbx.io/business/public/images/favicons/mstile-144x144-bbd2101292.png", "date": "2015-10-06T17:11:05.865Z", "parsely-section": "science-energy", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "og": {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-06/robbins-s-glenview-said-to-lose-12-in-september-on-health-care", "type": "website", "site_name": "Bloomberg.com", "description": "Glenview Capital Management, the hedge fund firm led by Larry Robbins, lost 12.4 percent in its main fund in September as bets on health-care companies suffered.", "title": "Glenview Fund Said to Lose 12% Last Month on Health Care"}, "fb": {"status": "Glenview Capital Management, the hedge fund firm led by Larry Robbins, lost 12.4 percent in its main fund in September as bets on health-care companies suffered."}, "parsely-post-id": "NVT4ARSYF02401", "format-detection": "telephone=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2580\"", "article_summary": "Glenview Capital Management, the hedge fund firm led by Larry Robbins, lost 12.4 percent in its main fund in September as bets on health-care companies suffered.\nGlenview, which wagers on and against stocks, has been reaping gains on investments in health-care companies for years.\nHealth-care stocks have slid since the summer, with the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Health Care Sector Index falling 14 percent since hitting a high on July 20.\nThose investments propelled the hedge fund to returns of 43 percent in 2013.\nTaylor Ingraham, a spokesman for the New York-based Glenview at ASC Advisors, declined to comment on the losses."}
