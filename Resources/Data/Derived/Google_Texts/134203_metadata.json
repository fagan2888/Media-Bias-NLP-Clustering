As he put it, \u201cCarson isn\u2019t going to get anywhere close to the nomination.\u201d\n\nBernstein linked to his previous arguments about this in the piece but I\u2019ll just summarize the major points here. In order be win the nomination of one of the two major political parties candidates have to clear at least two bars. They have to be within the mainstream of their parties position on the issues (sorry Bernie Sanders, Democrats aren\u2019t socialists) and have to conventional qualifications for the White House. What are conventional qualifications? Be sitting President or former Vice President, or have at least four years in state wide office as a Senator or Governor by Election Day (senior generals and significant House members might be able to win as well, but they haven\u2019t since Ike).\n\nEvery nominee since the modern nomination system was adopted in 1972 has met these qualifications, and to find a presidential nominee that hasn\u2019t you have to go back to Dewey in 1944.\n\nSo sorry Dr. Ben, being a heart surgeon (or a cable news talking head) doesn\u2019t count.\n\nBernstein was responding to an article in the The New York Times about a Carson, and it\u2019s a good read about what he\u2019s up to these days, hint he doesn\u2019t like Obamacare, but there\u2019s just no way Carson is going to win.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean Carson won\u2019t be able to raise money, have some good debate performances, or even do will in some opinion polls. But at the end of the day the GOP party actors that control the nominating process are going settle on a candidate and it\u2019s not going to be Carson.\n\nOr as Bernstein puts it:\n\nIn fact, as chaotic as the process may seem, and whatever public opinion polls or reporting may suggest, party actors will eventually settle on a plausible nominee\u2014or at the least narrow the field down to two or three choices they find acceptable. They\u2019ll funnel sufficient resources to that candidate or candidates (money, opinion leadership, personnel and more) to lock everyone else out of the nomination.\n\nLike The Good Men Project On Facebook\n\nPhoto by Susan Walsh/AP", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Good Men Project", "description": "The political exploits of Ben Carson may be interesting to follow, but he\u2019s never going to win the Republican nomination for the presidency.", "title": "Ben Carson Will Never Be President -", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 588, "identifier": "http://goodmenproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/bcarson.jpg", "height": 350}, "updated_time": "2014-12-24T00:37:39-04:00", "url": "http://goodmenproject.com/featured-content/jka-157314/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thegoodmenproject", "section": "Featured Content", "tag": "The Party Decides", "published_time": "2014-12-24T14:00:02-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-24T00:37:39-04:00"}, "fb": {"admins": 1467427114, "app_id": 794063960644791}, "twitter": {"description": "The political exploits of Ben Carson may be interesting to follow, but he\u2019s never going to win the Republican nomination for the presidency.", "creator": "@goodmenproject", "image": "http://goodmenproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/bcarson.jpg", "title": "Ben Carson Will Never Be President -", "site": "@goodmenproject", "card": "summary"}}, "article_summary": "byThe political exploits of Ben Carson may be interesting to follow, but he\u2019s never going to win the Republican nomination for the presidency.\nJonathan Bernstein made a great point the other day about the ongoing political adventures of Ben Carson, the African American heart surgeon turned Fox News pundit and presidential aspirant.\nThis doesn\u2019t mean Carson won\u2019t be able to raise money, have some good debate performances, or even do will in some opinion polls.\nAs he put it, \u201cCarson isn\u2019t going to get anywhere close to the nomination.\u201dBernstein linked to his previous arguments about this in the piece but I\u2019ll just summarize the major points here.\nSo sorry Dr. Ben, being a heart surgeon (or a cable news talking head) doesn\u2019t count."}
