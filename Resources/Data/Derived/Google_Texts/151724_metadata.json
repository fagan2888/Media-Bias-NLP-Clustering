Rand Paul lashed out against the federal government\u2019s sweeping surveillance programs on Wednesday, staking an aggressive position on an issue already dividing the Republican presidential field.\n\nThe libertarian-leaning Kentucky Republican, who launched a White House bid earlier in the month, noted that members of his own party support programs that allow the National Security Agency to collect the phone records of millions of Americans.\n\n\u201cOur Founding Fathers would be mortified,\u201d Paul said during an awards ceremony hosted by the Constitution Project, a Washington think tank.\n\n\u201cOur Founding Fathers would be mortified.\u201d Share:\n\nThe federal government\u2019s surveillance programs could play prominently in the GOP presidential primary contest, which is heating up just as Congress debates surveillance programs initiated by President George W. Bush\u2019s administration and continued under President Barack Obama.\n\nIn a Tuesday radio interview, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who is expected to run for the GOP nomination, praised the Obama administration\u2019s use of \u201cbig metadata programs\u201d that began under Bush\u2019s older brother.\n\n\u201cThere has been a continuation of a very important service,\u201d Bush said. \u201cThe first obligation, I think, of our national government is to keep us safe. And the technologies that now can be applied to make that so, while protecting civil liberties, are there.\u201d\n\nCongress is now deciding whether to renew or modify the phone records collection when the law authorizing it expires in June. Senate Republicans this week introduced a bill to allow the NSA to continue collecting the calling records of nearly every American, unveiling a measure that would bypass Senate committees and reauthorize sections of the USA Patriot Act.\n\nIntelligence officials say the program \u2014 it collects the \u201cto\u201d and \u201cfrom\u201d information of most domestic landline phone calls but not their content \u2014 is critical to detecting terrorist plots and have sought to justify it through the ongoing declassification of materials, including from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.\n\nPaul has promised to enact an executive order to end such government surveillance programs on his first day in office should he win the presidency.\n\nOn Wednesday, the first-term Kentucky senator took an apparent jab at Arizona Sen. John McCain\u2019s defense of the surveillance.\n\n\u201cOne unapologetic senator who I\u2019ve had a few rounds with said, \u2018If you\u2019re not talking to terrorists, why are you worried?\u2019\u201d Paul said. \u201cHave we fallen so low that that is our standard? If you have nothing to hide you have nothing to fear? It\u2019s a long way from innocent until proven guilty.\u201d\n\n\u2014", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "Story by the Associated Press; curated by Oliver Darcy.  \u2014  WASHINGTON\u00a0(AP) \u2014 Republican Sen.
