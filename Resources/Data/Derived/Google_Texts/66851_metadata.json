Just not everywhere.\n\nGeorgia is Humana Inc.\u2019s second-biggest market for insurance policies sold under the health law, and the home of what may be its biggest misstep. The company is now attempting a turnaround as it tries to make its strategy of selling coverage directly to consumers a success.\n\nIf it can\u2019t, it will quit the state. \u201cWe have to make a return,\u201d Humana Chief Executive Officer Bruce Broussard said in an interview. \u201cWe can\u2019t have one business being subsidized by another business.\u201d\n\nHumana\u2019s Georgia struggle shows the challenges health insurers face entering unfamiliar markets. President Barack Obama\u2019s 2010 health-care law will provide an estimated $19 billion in subsidies and helped about 12 million people buy coverage for this year. As insurers have raced to capture those customers, some are doing well, and others have overreached.\n\nHumana, which touts its skills at selling health insurance directly to individuals, ran into trouble in Georgia after charging too little for plans it sold on the state\u2019s new marketplace. Customers came running.\n\nUnfortunately, more of them were sicker than Humana expected. Flooded with patients, Humana let them see doctors who aren\u2019t in its networks. That\u2019s expensive -- health insurers make deals with doctors and hospitals to add them to their networks, negotiating lower prices in return for business.\n\nThe out-of-network generosity cost the insurer. Humana\u2019s stock declined 7.2 percent on April 29 after the insurer reported first-quarter profit that fell short of estimates amid increased spending on medical claims. It blamed some of its troubles on Georgia. Despite that, Humana\u2019s stock is up 24 percent this year.\n\nBack in Network\n\nMonths later, it\u2019s ending the out-of-network flexibility, Broussard said.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t have the capacity, to be honest with you, to be able to bring them back in,\u201d he said. \u201cStarting in July we will begin to start not allowing\u201d the out-of-network visits.\n\nHumana\u2019s experience differs from its large rivals, according to Steve Halper, an analyst at FBR & Co. UnitedHealth Group Inc. and Aetna Inc. have taken a more cautious approach to the exchanges, while Anthem Inc. has done well selling coverage on them.\n\n\u201cFrom time to time, payers are going to have isolated problems where they simply missed, and that\u2019s what happened in Georgia,\u201d Halper said. Still, for Humana, the insurance-exchange business has gone from being a source of strength to a question mark in investors\u2019 minds, he said.\n\nExchange Strategy\n\n\u201cIt begs the question about the whole exchange strategy,\u201d Halper said. If Humana withdraws from states like Georgia, \u201cthen you\u2019ve wasted all your time and effort in building a business that goes away.\u201d\n\nHumana isn\u2019t entirely alone. Iowa insurance startup CoOportunity Health has already failed, and a report from Standard & Poor\u2019s earlier this year found that many other new insurers were struggling with cash flow.\n\nFor patients, Humana\u2019s decision highlights the limited choice of doctors typically offered by plans on the health law exchanges, said Donald J. Palmisano, Jr., executive director of the Medical Association of Georgia.\n\n\u201cIt impacts who the physicians can refer to and it impacts access to physicians,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act includes several payment systems designed to help insurers that take on customers who prove to be more costly. Those funds will help cover some of Humana\u2019s costs, the insurer has said. Humana, the fifth-largest U.S. health insurer by market value, gets most of its revenue from sales of private Medicare policies.\n\nGeorgia Growth\n\nHumana counted about 254,000 Obamacare members in Georgia as of March 31. About 479,095 people were covered by policies purchased in Georgia\u2019s insurance marketplace as of April 15, according to the state regulator.\n\nHumana\u2019s solution for next year? Higher prices and, hopefully, more profitable customers. The insurer is adjusting its 2016 premiums in the state to account for the sicker population, Chief Financial Officer Brian Kane told investors at a May 12 conference held by Bank of America Corp.\u2019s Merrill Lynch.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very mindful of the morbidity of that state and we think we\u2019ve captured that in our pricing, and we\u2019ll see,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we have a problem again next year, I think we\u2019ll be having a different discussion about our willingness to participate in the 2017 program.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Zachary Tracer", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-05-20/obamacare-setback-has-humana-attempting-a-georgia-turnaround", "title": "Obamacare Setback Has Humana Attempting a Georgia Turnaround", "description": "Obamacare has been great business for U.S. health insurers.
