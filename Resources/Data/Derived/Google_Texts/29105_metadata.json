Cherry has has received a total of 13 civilian complaints against him according to a person with knowledge of the latest complaint. That complaint alleges the officer was abusive, threatened the driver with arrest, was discourteous and used offensive language regarding the driver\u2019s apparent ethnicity, the person said.\n\nMichael Palladino, president of the Detectives\u2019 Endowment Association, called the detective \u201ca person of good character and an excellent Detective.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe really should not be judged by one isolated incident,\u201d Mr. Palladino said.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "A 38-year-old detective captured on video berating a New York City taxi driver was stripped of his badge and gun, placed on desk duty and is being transferred from an elite New York Police Department unit, Police Commissioner William Bratton said Wednesday.", "title": "NYPD Officer Who Berated Taxi Driver in YouTube Video Placed on Desk Duty", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2015/04/01/nypd-officer-who-berated-taxi-driver-in-youtube-video-placed-on-desk-duty/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "site": "WSJNY", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "New York", "article.headline": "NYPD Officer Who Berated Taxi Driver in YouTube Video Placed on Desk Duty", "description": "A 38-year-old detective captured on video berating a New York City taxi driver was stripped of his badge and gun, placed on desk duty and is being transferred from an elite New York Police Department unit, Police Commissioner William Bratton said Wednesday.", "article_section": "New York", "author": "Pervaiz Shallwani", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Metropolis Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Metropolis", "article.summary": "A 38-year-old detective captured on video berating a New York City taxi driver was stripped of his badge and gun, placed on desk duty and is being transferred from an elite New York Police Department unit, Police Commissioner William Bratton said Wednesday.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2015-04-01T20:54:12-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-143", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2015/04/01/nypd-officer-who-berated-taxi-driver-in-youtube-video-placed-on-desk-duty/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-METROB-22824", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "New York", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "A 38-year-old detective captured on video berating a New York City taxi driver was stripped of his badge and gun, placed on desk duty and is being transferred from an elite New York Police Department unit, Police Commissioner William Bratton said Wednesday.", "title": "NYPD Officer Who Berated Taxi Driver in YouTube Video Placed on Desk Duty", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2015/04/01/nypd-officer-who-berated-taxi-driver-in-youtube-video-placed-on-desk-duty/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Metropolis", "article.id": "BL-METROB-22824", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-04-02T14:24:16-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb68f\"", "article_summary": "\u201cNo good cop can watch that without a wince,\u201d Mr. Bratton said sternly during a news conference.\nMr. Bratton said the anger, discourtesy and language displayed in the video is \u201cunacceptable,\u201d in any encounter.\nMr. Bratton said the NYPD\u2019s Internal Affairs Bureau reviewed the video and forwarded the matter to the Civilian Complaint Review Board which is investigating.\nA 38-year-old detective captured on video berating a New York City taxi driver was stripped of his badge and gun, placed on desk duty and is being transferred from an elite New York Police Department unit, Police Commissioner William Bratton said Wednesday.\nThat complaint alleges the officer was abusive, threatened the driver with arrest, was discourteous and used offensive language regarding the driver\u2019s apparent ethnicity, the person said."}
