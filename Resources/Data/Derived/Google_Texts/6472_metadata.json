Drew Gattine, a Democrat from Westbrook. He co-chairs the legislature\u2019s health and human services committee, and I wanted to offer readers a deeper look at the challenges facing the committee this session. The conversation was enlightening, and one of the things we talked about was the contentious issue of MaineCare expansion, possible under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nGattine said the legislature would be considering a bill sponsored by Sen. Tom Saviello, R-Wilton, that had been carried over from the first part of the 127th session. The last two legislatures have passed MaineCare expansion bills five times, and Gov. Paul LePage has vetoed each one. Saviello is a Republican supporting the issue largely driven by Democrats.\n\nThe hardest part about interviewing Saviello was trying not to laugh too hard as we swapped stories about the wonderful people from his district, which covers all of Franklin County and Belgrade, Fayette, Mt. Vernon and Vienna in Kennebec County. Over the years I\u2019ve had close personal ties throughout his district and have developed a fondness for the communities of that region.\n\nSaviello talked about participating in Weed Whacker Tosses and games of horse shoe using toilet seats at an Avon community event. I brought up the guys in Mt. Vernon who used to attend community events on the mobile picnic table \u2014 a picnic table and cooler affixed to a four wheeler. I\u2019m sure there was at least some duct tape involved, and seeing something like that at a Memorial Day parade is all you need to see to know why you live in Maine.\n\nMutual love of that chunk of rural Maine aside, Saviello is serious about his responsibilities to his constituents and to his colleagues in the legislature. He loves his constituents \u2014 so much so that he lists his relationship status on Facebook as \u201ccomplicated.\u201d Saviello invests considerable time in this \u201clove affair\u201d with his constituency, from letters to anyone who gets a picture in one of the four local papers, which he reads daily, to participating in local celebrations, to moderating town meetings.\n\nAnd his constituents love him back. Saviello is serving his third term and is proud to have received more votes than any other sitting senator. He hopes to have the honor of serving his district one more time before retiring to his family, his community of Wilton and his business.\n\nSaviello compared serving in the legislature to being in high school, with his third term being the equivalent of his junior year. He\u2019s over the freshman jitters, and he became more acclimated during his sophomore session. Now as a junior, Saviello likes knowing enough about \u201chow the system works to be able to make a difference.\u201d\n\nGood relationships with his colleagues are a critical part of his work. He is chairman of the environment and natural resources committee, and is proud of its members\u2019 bipartisanship. The committee has handled 60 bills this session, and only three or four came out as divided reports; the rest were either approved or killed mostly unanimously.\n\nSaviello explains that there are indeed differences between the views of committee members, but as chairman he wants \u201cto ensure that everybody\u2019s side is heard about a bill from the public to the various committee members.\u201d He tries to foster a healthy debate, so committee members can reach an informed consensus in most cases, which results in less time wasted for fellow legislators when bills come out of his committee.\n\nIt\u2019s not always a perfect process, though, and Saviello referred to a mining bill, LD 750, that was voted down in the House during the first part of the session. The bill was intended to make modifications to a 2012 bill, and Saviello and Rep. Robert Duchesne, D-Hudson, spent considerable time drafting changes. While Saviello was proud of the work he and Duchesne and other committee members did, he learned a valuable lesson about the role \u201cmarketing\u201d can play in a bill\u2019s success or lack thereof.\n\nSaviello regrets not focusing more attention on informing and explaining, and on framing discussion around the proposed changes better \u2014 lessons that will apply to his attempt to help the legislature reach some kind of consensus regarding MaineCare expansion.\n\nWhen I asked why he supports an expansion, Saviello replied quite simply, \u201cBecause my community needs it.\u201d He talked about representing many constituents who \u201cfall below or just above the poverty line\u201d and about his local hospital being financially burdened by charity care costs. Charity care is free medical care provided by hospitals to patients who do not have insurance and whose incomes fall below levels necessary for hospitals to bill them for care, which leads to increased costs for everyone \u2014 from the hospitals themselves to people paying for private insurance.\n\nMedical insurance enables people to access preventive care, something Saviello came to appreciate when he faced a health crisis of his own years ago. He hadn\u2019t been feeling well, and when a colonoscopy showed a small amount of cancer, he was able to have it removed immediately with only routine check-ups as a follow-up plan \u2014 \u201ca $1,500 fix.\u201d\n\nSaviello worries that constituents without insurance wait to receive care because they cannot afford regular doctor visits. Were someone in his situation to wait, a problem that was a \u201c$1,500 fix could quickly become a problem that costs $50,000 to $100,000\u201d and possibly a life if the person didn\u2019t survive. His own health crisis made him realize how lucky he was to be insured. He referred to Maslow\u2019s Hierarchy of Needs, which establishes physiological needs as the most basic need for human survival.\n\nSaviello firmly believes that access to health care is a fundamental basic need necessary to help people become as productive as they can possibly be.\n\nThe addiction epidemic has added a sense of urgency for Saviello, though, that goes beyond his initial support for an expansion. On a personal level, someone who grew up with his kids recently died of an overdose, and his heart is broken for that family. On a legislative level, he is hearing from everyone \u2014 law enforcement, health care professionals, citizens \u2014 that a lack of insurance is a big problem for people with substance use disorders seeking treatment.\n\nHe sees a role for expanded MaineCare as a critical tool in addressing the addiction epidemic. It\u2019s a tool that can be used for people in the community seeking treatment and for people whose addictions may have contributed to criminal convictions that result in incarceration. Saviello foresees being able to offer folks leaving jail and prison the support they need as they transition back to the community, hopefully accessing treatment and other services necessary to recover from addiction.\n\nA recent report he read indicated that three states that expanded Medicaid (MaineCare) access are seeing lower recidivism rates in the wake of expansion. Saviello hopes that his fellow legislators unanimous desire to address addiction in our state will tip the scale in favor of expansion.\n\nThe proposed expansion would be different than some might think. It is modeled after programs in a few other states, like Arkansas, Indiana and Kentucky, that received waivers from the federal government enabling these states to expand using private insurers. Saviello has been in contact with officials from these states to learn about their systems and how they are working. He admitted he\u2019d heard that Arkansas is having problems but was confident that such potential problems could be addressed while creating a model for Maine.\n\nNo one knows more than Saviello that any proposed expansion of MaineCare faces a steep uphill climb after five vetoes that were not overridden by legislators, but he remains optimistic. He plans to be thorough in his research and proposal, as well as in the packet of information he plans to give to every legislator. Beyond that, he doesn\u2019t plan to do much in terms of lobbying or pressuring; he hopes his colleagues will duly consider the proposal and vote their conscience, even if it may not be along party lines.\n\nSaviello uses this approach to every vote he personally casts regardless of the issue. He said, \u201cIf something goes to the floor and there\u2019s a debate on it, whether I vote for or against, if you ask my why, I will have a reason.\u201d Calling it \u201ctrying to be a statesman,\u201d Saviello plans to appeal to this same sensibility in his colleagues as he asks for their support.\n\nHe said 58 percent of his constituents support an expansion (30 percent are against, and the remainder are undecided). Saviello is collaborating with law enforcement, emergency room doctors and prosecutors to build a broader coalition around the idea of expansion. He openly acknowledges that he may not succeed, but he asserts that he is going to give it his all and \u201chas more wrapped into that [MaineCare expansion] than any other bill.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about my love for the people,\u201d Saviello said, \u201cIt\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201d\n\nRecommend this article", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.1.5", "og": {"site_name": "Mainely Thoughts", "description": "\u201cIt\u2019s about my love for the people,\u201d Saviello said, \u201cIt\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201d", "title": "Republican Sen.
