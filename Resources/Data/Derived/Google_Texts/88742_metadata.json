On that date Pauls Valley police responded to a two-vehicle collision near Indian Meridian Rd. and Arrowhead Dr. At the scene, police found 21-year-old Tonia Pando severely injured. Pando, who was pregnant, died at the hospital on Nov. 3.\n\nAn investigation into the incident determined that Imotichey traveled left of center and collided with Pando's vehicle head on. At the time of the crash it was suspected that Imotichey was intoxicated, but because he was transported to the hospital as well, only a blood draw was performed.\n\nLast Friday, Pauls Valley Police say they received the final piece of evidence that indicated Imotichey was indeed intoxicated at the time of the crash. With that evidence, police were able to obtain an arrest warrant and on Thursday Imotichey was taken into custody at a home in Sulphur.\n\nImotichey was booked into the Garvin County Jail on two felony counts of first-degree manslaughter. His bond was set at $50,000.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "A Wynnewood man was charged with two counts of first-degree manslaughter after a two-car crash back in October 2013 that resulted in the deaths of a mother and her unborn child.", "author": "Matthew Nuttle", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/26396761/dui-suspect-charged-with-manslaughter-in-death-of-pregnant-pauls-valley-woman", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/4600608_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A Wynnewood man was charged with two counts of first-degree manslaughter after a two-car crash back in October 2013 that resulted in the deaths of a mother and her unborn child.", "title": "DUI Suspect Charged With Manslaughter In Death Of Pregnant Pauls Valley Woman"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/4600608_G.jpg", "description": "A Wynnewood man was charged with two counts of first-degree manslaughter after a two-car crash back in October 2013 that resulted in the deaths of a mother and her unborn child.", "card": "summary", "title": "DUI Suspect Charged With Manslaughter In Death Of Pregnant Pauls Valley Woman"}, "wnreadableurl": "dui-suspect-charged-with-manslaughter-in-death-of-pregnant-pauls-valley-woman", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "date": "2014/08/28", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "owner": "KWTV", "KEYWORDS": "oklahoma city,pauls valley,DUI,wynnewood,manslaughter,two-car,collision,pregnant,mother,matthew nuttle,kwtv,cbs,news9", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS21", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "oklahoma city,pauls valley,DUI,wynnewood,manslaughter,two-car,collision,pregnant,mother,matthew nuttle,kwtv,cbs,news9"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2b48\"", "article_summary": "On that date Pauls Valley police responded to a two-vehicle collision near Indian Meridian Rd.\nImotichey was booked into the Garvin County Jail on two felony counts of first-degree manslaughter.\nPauls Valley Police arrested 25-year-old Matthew Imotichey early Thursday morning.\nA Wynnewood man was charged with two counts of first-degree manslaughter after a two-car crash back in October 2013 that resulted in the deaths of a mother and her unborn child.\nLast Friday, Pauls Valley Police say they received the final piece of evidence that indicated Imotichey was indeed intoxicated at the time of the crash."}
