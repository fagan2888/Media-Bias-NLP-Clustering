St Helens won the match 14-6, but Flower's actions was the talking point.\n\nThe image of a defenceless man being punched in the head by another player kneeled over him left referee Phil Bentham with no option but to give Flower his marching orders. Hohaia left the field for treatment and did not return.\n\nRed card offence: Ben Flower of Wigan Warriors punches Lance Hohaia. Photo: Screengrab\n\nWith the game just 123 seconds old, viewers instantly took to social media to slam the Wales international for his brain snap and violent conduct.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRespected British boxing commentator Steve Bunce went so far to say Flower should be locked up for his actions.\n\nI'm assuming that Ben Flower likes prison food - he has to be nicked for that assault. That's a UFC inspired second punch, savage. \u2014 Steve Bunce (@bigdaddybunce) October 11, 2014\n\nMarching orders: referee Phil Bentham sends off Ben Flower of Wigan Warriors.

To do what he did is an utter disgrace. If he did it in the street he'd be on an assault charge. Utter scum\n\n\u2014 Mark Whitby (@twitspvfc) October 11, 2014\n\nJust seen the Ben Flower incident. That is assault, plain and simple. Police should be involved.\n\n\u2014 Peter Miller (@TheCricketGeek) October 11, 2014\n\nBen Flower should lose his job, and be sent to prison. But nothing will be said of him because he is a bloody rugby player\n\n\u2014 George Toner (@George_Toner) October 11, 2014\n\nRugby league commentator Andrew Voss said Flower's \"act of thuggery\" was \"as bad as I have ever seen,\" while former Canterbury Bulldogs player Steve Turner said he was \"lost for words\".\n\nThe number of fans and celebrities against Flower's actions was damning.\n\nIn China but just seen those punches in The Super League Grand Final on Twitter. First one was shocking but the second one was a disgrace.\n\n\u2014 michael owen (@themichaelowen) October 11, 2014\n\nWhen out and about tonight don't act like @WiganWarriorsRL Ben Flower or you will end up #bangedupinbarrow \u2014 Barrow Police (@barrowpolice) October 11, 2014\n\nWhat on earth was Ben Flower thinking? To punch once is daft to punch him again when he was down is horrible. \u2014 Elizabeth (@legsidelizzy) October 11, 2014\n\nHowever, many viewers have pointed out that Flower was provoked by Hohaia, which might explain his first punch on the Saints playmaker.\n\nReplays suggest Flower pushed Hohaia over while chasing for the ball after a high bomb. With a certain try on the cards, Flower then dropped the ball to which Hohaia made a hit on him in retaliation.\n\nSome Twitter users have suggested Hohaia deserved a square up of sorts.\n\nI'm not defending Ben Flower at all. Just saying he did cop a beauty of an elbow right in the mush just before he threw the 1st dig.\n\n\u2014 Joseph Barton (@Joey7Barton) October 11, 2014\n\nHow can people call Ben Flower scum, don't get me wrong the guy didn't deserve the 2nd bang but he was gonna get an elbow in his chops \u2014 AlfMan (@alfieedunn) October 11, 2014", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "League News", "application-name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "og": {"site_name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "description": "One of the most violent acts seen&amp;#160;on a football field has left fans venting their disgust on social media.&amp;#160;", "title": "'He has to be nicked for that assault': commentators, celebrities and fans condemn Ben Flower for sickening punch in Super League Grand Final", "url": "http://www.smh.com.au/rugby-league/league-news/he-has-to-be-nicked-for-that-assault-commentators-celebrities-and-fans-condemn-ben-flower-for-sickening-punch-in-super-league-grand-final-20141012-114vv4.html", "image": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/3/h/u/5/2/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.114vv4.png/1413123931967.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/3/h/u/5/2/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.114vv4.png/1413123931967.jpg"}, "title": "'He has to be nicked for that assault': commentators, celebrities and fans condemn Ben Flower for sickening punch in Super League Grand Final", "description": "One of the most violent acts seen&#160;on a football field has left fans venting their disgust on social media.&#160;", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@smh"}, "robots": "ACAP allow-present prohibited-modification=annotation", "msapplication-tooltip": "Open The Sydney Morning Herald", "fb": {"app_id": 193677504039845}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.smh.com.au", "msapplication-task": "name=Weather;action-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/weather;icon-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/favicon.ico;", "description": "One of the most violent acts seen&#160;on a football field has left fans venting their disgust on social media.&#160;"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdff31\"", "article_summary": "\u2014 michael owen (@themichaelowen) October 11, 2014When out and about tonight don't act like @WiganWarriorsRL Ben Flower or you will end up #bangedupinbarrow \u2014 Barrow Police (@barrowpolice) October 11, 2014What on earth was Ben Flower thinking?\nI'm assuming that Ben Flower likes prison food - he has to be nicked for that assault.\nI'm not defending Ben Flower at all.\nRed card offence: Ben Flower of Wigan Warriors punches Lance Hohaia.\n\u2014 Steve Bunce (@bigdaddybunce) October 11, 2014Marching orders: referee Phil Bentham sends off Ben Flower of Wigan Warriors."}
