It was signed into law July 30, 1965 -- the crowning achievement of Lyndon Johnson's Great Society. It's more popular than ever.\n\nYet Medicare continues to be blamed for America's present and future budget problems.\n\nA few days ago Jeb Bush even suggested phasing it out. Seniors already receiving benefits should continue to receive them, he said, but \"we need to figure out a way to phase out this program for others and move to a new system that allows them to have something, because they're not going to have anything.\"\n\nBush praised Rep. Paul Ryan's plan to give seniors vouchers instead. What Bush didn't say was that Ryan's vouchers wouldn't keep up with increases in medical costs -- leaving seniors with less coverage.\n\nMedicare isn't the problem. In fact, it's the solution.\n\nIts costs are being pushed upward by the rising costs of health care overall -- which have slowed somewhat since the Affordable Care Act was introduced but are still rising faster than inflation.\n\nMedicare costs are also rising because of the growing ranks of boomers becoming eligible for Medicare.\n\nMedicare offers a way to reduce these underlying costs -- if Washington would let it.\n\nLet me explain.\n\nAmericans spend more on health care per person than any other advanced nation and get less for our money. Yearly public and private healthcare spending is almost two and a half times the average of other advanced nations.\n\nYet the typical American lives 78.1 years -- less than the average 80.1 years in other advanced nations. And we have the highest rate of infant mortality of all advanced nations.\n\nMedical costs continue to rise because doctors and hospitals still spend too much money on unnecessary tests, drugs, and procedures.\n\nConsider lower back pain, one of the most common ailments of our sedentary society. Almost 95% of it can be relieved through physical therapy.\n\nBut doctors and hospitals often do expensive MRI's, and then refer patients to orthopedic surgeons for costly surgery. Why? Physical therapy doesn't generate much revenue.\n\nOr say your diabetes, asthma, or heart condition is acting up. If you seek treatment in a hospital, 20 percent of the time you're back within a month.\n\nIt would be far less costly if a nurse visited you at home to make sure you were taking your medications, a common practice in other advanced nations. But nurses don't do home visits to Americans with acute conditions because hospitals aren't paid for them.\n\nAmerica still spends about over $19 billion a year fixing medical errors, the worst rate among advanced countries. Such errors are the third major cause of hospital deaths.\n\nOne big reason is we keep patient records on computers that can't share the data. Patient records are continuously re-written and then re-entered into different computers. That leads to lots of mistakes.\n\nMeanwhile, administrative costs account for 15 to 30 percent of all health care spending in the United States, twice the rate of most other advanced nations.\n\nMost of this is to collect money: Doctors collecting from hospitals and insurers, hospitals collecting from insurers, insurers collecting from companies or policy holders. A third of nursing hours are devoted to documenting what's done so that insurers have proof.\n\nCutting back Medicare won't affect any of this. It will just funnel more money into the hands of for-profit insurers while limiting the amount of care seniors receive.\n\nThe answer isn't to shrink Medicare. It's to grow it -- allowing anyone at any age to join.\n\nMedicare's administrative costs are in the range of 3 percent.\n\nThat's well below the 5 to 10 percent costs borne by large companies that self-insure. It's even further below the administrative costs of companies in the small-group market (amounting to 25 to 27 percent of premiums).\n\nAnd it's way, way lower than the administrative costs of individual insurance (40 percent). It's even far below the 11 percent costs of private plans under Medicare Advantage, the current private-insurance option under Medicare.\n\nMeanwhile, as for-profit insurance companies merge into giant behemoths that reduce consumer choice still further, it's doubly important to make Medicare available to all.\n\nMedicare should also be allowed to use its huge bargaining leverage to negotiate lower rates with pharmaceutical companies -- which Obamacare barred in order to get Big Insurance to go along with the legislation.\n\nThese moves would give more Americans quality health care, slow rising healthcare costs, help reduce federal budget deficit, and keep Medicare going.\n\nLet me say it again: Medicare isn't the problem. It's the solution.\n\nROBERT B. REICH's film \"Inequality for All\" is now available on DVD and blu-ray, and on Netflix.
