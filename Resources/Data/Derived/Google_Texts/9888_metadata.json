At 7% off its peak, its flat base is intact as shares continue to find support at its 50-day moving average.\n\nMolina has been shaping a flat base over the past five weeks, with a potential buy point of 74.08. The stock has advanced more than 28% this year. A 1.8 up-down volume ratio implies solid demand for shares. The number of mutual funds owning shares rose to 444 as of June 30, up from 360 in the same quarter a year earlier.\n\nThe Long Beach, Calif.-based company provides managed health care services to low-income families under the Medicaid and Medicare programs and via state insurance marketplaces. It serves over 3 million members through locally operated health plans in 11 states.\n\nIt owns the second-best Composite Rating, 97, in the 13-stock managed care industry group. Molina\u2019s 97 Earnings Per Share Rating is tops in the group, helped by a five-year earnings growth rate of 31% and triple-digit profit gains the past two quarters.\n\nBut its five-year Earnings Stability Factor is 95 on a scale of 0 (most stable) to 99 (most volatile). Analysts expect earnings to fall 16% this year, then rise 36% the next.\n\nRevenue growth continues to hold steady in the double digits. The consensus estimate calls for a 47% jump this year and 14% in 2016. The health care service provider will report Q2 results after hours on July 30. On June 30 after the close, Molina joined the S&P MidCap 400.\n\nManaged care providers spent much of June in the spotlight along with hospitals and other health care stocks ahead of a June 25 ruling on ObamaCare. The Supreme Court\u2019s decision to uphold taxpayer-funded subsidies lifted those stocks.\n\nThe managed care group rallied 3% that day. It\u2019s edged lower since but still outperforms at No. 8 in Tuesday\u2019s issue.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Though some managed care stocks have fallen more than 10% from their 52-week highs, Molina Healthcare is staying healthy.
