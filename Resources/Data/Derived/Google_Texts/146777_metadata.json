The president used the occasion to reflect on the triumphs of his presidency, and celebrate his achievements: The Affordable Care Act, the non-collapse of the economy, the historic climate deal agreement in Paris, and others.\n\nHe also spent some time discussing his hopes for the future, as he prepares to hand off the office to somebody else.\n\nAnd he used his time to offer us guidance on how to deal with those people who, still, think that political correctness is just a way of curbing people\u2019s right to free speech. It\u2019s not. As Obama explains:\n\nWe need to reject any politics that targets people because of race or religion. This isn\u2019t a matter of political correctness. It\u2019s a matter of understanding what makes us strong. The world respects us not just for our arsenal; it respects us for our diversity and our openness and the way we respect everything.\n\nAnd he cited someone else you may have heard of who agrees that speaking respectfully about each other is key:\n\nHis Holiness, Pope Francis, told this body from the very spot I stand tonight that \u201cto imitate the hatred and violence of tyrants and murderers is the best way to take their place.\u201d When politicians insult Muslims, when a mosque is vandalized, or a kid bullied, that doesn\u2019t make us safer.\n\n\u2026 and then he really brought it home:\n\nThat\u2019s not telling it like it is. It\u2019s just wrong. It diminishes us in the eyes of the world. It makes it harder to achieve our goals. And it betrays who we are as a country.\n\nWe hope you\u2019re listening, Mr. Trump.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://fusion.net/wp-content/themes/fusion-theme/assets/images/favicons/browserconfig.xml?v=1462067892199", "msapplication-TileColor": "#da532c", "description": "Here's how Obama shot down anyone who unfairly labeled political policies \"politically correct.\"", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Fusion", "description": "On Tuesday night, President Obama delivered his eighth and final State of the Union address to congress.", "title": "President Obama Had the Perfect Response to People Who Complain About Political Correctness", "url": "http://fusion.net/story/254893/sotu-political-correctness-perfect-response/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://i1.wp.com/fusion.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/obama.jpg?resize=1200%2C630&quality=80&strip=all", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "On Tuesday night, President Obama delivered his eighth and final State of the Union address to congress.", "title": "President Obama had the perfect response to people who complain about", "url": "http://fusion.net/story/254893/sotu-political-correctness-perfect-response/", "image": "http://i1.wp.com/fusion.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/obama.jpg?resize=560%2C294&quality=80&strip=all", "site": "@fusion", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Fusion.net", "pocket-site-verification": "81a5587d6c56043280b2554922f43d", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6a5260d31ead375c331934cb6df4833"}, "fb": {"app_id": 796694167041552}, "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://fusion.net/wp-content/themes/fusion-theme/assets/images/favicons/mstile-144x144.png?v=1462067892199", "application-name": "Fusion.net", "msvalidate.01": "0EABD001D404EA9DDE2025E9E4F14CAF", "google-site-verification": "BKw_9qDU04u2w1WoNF53fplAwWXVK_DJ1b6rZDR5u-M", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "state of the union, SOTU, political correctness, Obama SOTU, SOTU obama, obama state of the union, state of the union obama, sotu 2016, obama political correctness, obama politically correct"}, "article_summary": "On Tuesday night, President Obama delivered his eighth and final State of the Union address to congress.\nThe world respects us not just for our arsenal; it respects us for our diversity and our openness and the way we respect everything.\nAs Obama explains:We need to reject any politics that targets people because of race or religion.\nHe also spent some time discussing his hopes for the future, as he prepares to hand off the office to somebody else.\nThe president used the occasion to reflect on the triumphs of his presidency, and celebrate his achievements: The Affordable Care Act, the non-collapse of the economy, the historic climate deal agreement in Paris, and others."}
