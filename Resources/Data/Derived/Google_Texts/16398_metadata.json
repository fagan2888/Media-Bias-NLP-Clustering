Sixty-four percent of Americans owned a laptop at the beginning of last year, according to a Gallup poll, and 62 percent owned a smartphone. That\u2019s a lot of people who are most likely listening to music for hours each day, and it doesn\u2019t even include the music people listen to on home systems or in their cars. That\u2019s a lot of noise pollution, and it only accounts for people in the U.S. All told, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates in a new report that as many as a billion young people worldwide might be at risk of hearing loss due to all that listening.\n\n\u201cAs they go about their daily lives doing what they enjoy, more and more young people are placing themselves at risk of hearing loss,\u201d said Dr. Etienne Krug, WHO director of the Department for Management of Noncommunicable Diseases, Disability, Violence and Injury Prevention, in a press release. \u201cThey should be aware that once you lose your hearing, it won\u2019t come back. Taking simple preventive actions will allow people to continue to enjoy themselves without putting their hearing at risk.\u201d\n\nAlmost 50 percent of young people aged 12 to 35 who live in middle- and high-income countries put themselves at risk of hearing loss while listening to music on their personal devices, WHO found. But the risk isn\u2019t only limited to smartphones and the like; about 40 percent of people also risk hearing loss when they go to concerts, clubs, bars, sporting events, and even fitness classes. What\u2019s more, rates of hearing loss have risen \u2014 presumably with more widespread use of technology \u2014 from 3.5 percent of teens aged 12 to 19 in 1994 to 5.3 percent in 2006.\n\nCommon sounds like that of an airplane, thunder, and even a hair dryer are all louder than 85 decibels (dB) \u2014 as sounds get louder than this, the duration of time we can safely listen to them quickly decreases. Clubs, bars, and other venues often play music over 100 dB and most people who use personal audio devices listen to them at a range between 75 and 105 dB. People \u201cmay expose themselves to the same level of loudness in 15 minutes of music at 100 dB that an industrial worker gets in an 8-hour day at 85 dB,\u201d the report said.\n\nBy limiting our exposure to these noises, WHO says we can avoid joining the ranks of the 43 million young people with hearing loss. Wearing earplugs to venues, limiting personal audio device usage to only an hour, and using noise-cancelling headphones to hear music clearly at a low volume are all ways to reduce the risk of irreversible hearing loss.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s not easy to limit exposure that much; some of us just can\u2019t resist hearing good tunes throughout the day. Therefore it\u2019s important to be aware of the signs of hearing loss, which include tinnitus; being unable to hear high-pitched sounds like doorbells, telephones, and alarm clocks; understanding conversations over the phone, and following one in noisy environments. If any of these issues begin to emerge, it\u2019s time to see a doctor.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "1, billion, people, risk, hearing, loss, because, they, listen, music, too, loud, other, sounds", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The World Health Organization says as many as one billion people risk hearing loss due to loud music and concerts, among other ways to listen to music.", "title": "Loud Music, Concerts Put 1 Billion People At Risk Of Hearing Loss", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/1-billion-people-risk-hearing-loss-because-they-listen-music-too-loud-other-sounds-323972", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/03/01/hearing-loss.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The World Health Organization says as many as one billion people risk hearing loss due to loud music and concerts, among other ways to listen to music.", "title": "Loud Music, Concerts Put 1 Billion People At Risk Of Hearing Loss", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/1-billion-people-risk-hearing-loss-because-they-listen-music-too-loud-other-sounds-323972", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/03/01/hearing-loss.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/03/01/hearing-loss.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-03-01T14:05:59-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-01T14:08:23-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The World Health Organization says as many as one billion people risk hearing loss due to loud music and concerts, among other ways to listen to music."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd15a5\"", "article_summary": "But the risk isn\u2019t only limited to smartphones and the like; about 40 percent of people also risk hearing loss when they go to concerts, clubs, bars, sporting events, and even fitness classes.\nBy limiting our exposure to these noises, WHO says we can avoid joining the ranks of the 43 million young people with hearing loss.\nWhat\u2019s more, rates of hearing loss have risen \u2014 presumably with more widespread use of technology \u2014 from 3.5 percent of teens aged 12 to 19 in 1994 to 5.3 percent in 2006.\nThat\u2019s a lot of people who are most likely listening to music for hours each day, and it doesn\u2019t even include the music people listen to on home systems or in their cars.\nTherefore it\u2019s important to be aware of the signs of hearing loss, which include tinnitus; being unable to hear high-pitched sounds like doorbells, telephones, and alarm clocks; understanding conversations over the phone, and following one in noisy environments."}
