Judis\u2019s argument in favor of an \u201cemerging Democratic majority\u201d was a compelling one.\n\nThe theory held that a rising coalition of Democratic voters and shifts in the nation\u2019s demographic makeup would create the conditions in which Democrats would find it easier to win statewide and national office. For a time, this prediction appeared prescient.\n\nWriting in The Atlantic on the ten year anniversary of The Emerging Democratic Majority\u2019s publication, Teixeira highlighted a paragraph that summed up their theory. He posited that the Democrats\u2019 winning coalition was evident as long ago as 1972, a year in which the party suffered a crippling national loss to Republicans and President Richard Nixon.\n\nWhat did it matter if McGovern won Alameda County and San Francisco but decisively lost Los Angeles and San Diego? Or that he did better among working women than men, and among professionals than blue collar workers, but still lost a majority of all these voters? Thirty years later, however, these anomalies loom larger. Women are still voting more Democratic than men, but they are also voting much more Democratic than Republican, particularly women who now work outside the home, single women and women with college degrees. Minorities, once about ten percent of the voting electorate, now constitute nineteen percent\u2026They, too, are continuing to vote Democratic. Democrats are winning even more decisively in college towns, and these towns and their schools have become linked to entire regions like Silicon Valley and North Carolina\u2019s Research Triangle. And, skilled professionals have become a much larger and a dependably Democratic voting group.\n\nIt is important to note what Judis and Teixeira do not argue. \u201cJudis and Teixeira don\u2019t argue, for instance, that Democrats are predestined to hold a permanent majority for several decades,\u201d The New York Times analyst Nate Cohen wrote for The New Republic. \u201cNor do they contend that Democrats can abandon white working-class voters.\u201d The EDM thesis rests on the notion that the coalition of voters that Democrats have built over the decades will be able to withstand the occasional bad election cycle and remain largely stable.\n\nBut, while taking a victory lap in the wake of President Barack Obama\u2019s 2012 reelection victory, Teixeira inadvertently identified the fatal flaw in his and Judis\u2019s theory: Voters expected results from the party in which they had vested new authority.\n\nToday\u2019s Americans\u2026want government to play an active and responsible role in American life, guaranteeing a reasonable level of economic security to Americans rather than leaving them at the mercy of the market and the business cycle. They want to preserve and strengthen Social Security and Medicare, rather than privatize them. They want to modernize and upgrade public education, not abandon it. They want to exploit new bio-technologies and computer technologies in order to improve the quality of life. They do not want science held hostage to a religious or ideological agenda. And they want the social gains of the sixties consolidated, not rolled back; the wounds of race healed, not inflamed.\n\nMuch of this analysis is a product of its period. After six years of Democratic governance, Americans are no longer confident that Democrats can deliver economic security. They are skeptical of the long-term viability of the welfare state. They are deeply suspicious of the institution of public education and its ability to provide a future for their children. And they have no illusions about the Democratic Party\u2019s commitment to healing racial divisions.\n\nFollowing two consecutive disastrous midterm elections into the Obama-era, the Democratic Party is in its worst position in 90 years. Democrats have lost majorities in the House and the Senate \u2013 in the former, Republicans hold a majority that is the largest it has been since Al Smith ran a quixotic campaign for the White House as an urban progressive reformer and lost 40 states. On the legislative level, Republicans now control 69 of 99 state-level chambers; the Democratic Party\u2019s \u201cfarm team\u201d has been decimated. A whole generation of aspiring Democratic officeholders saw their careers cut short under Obama\u2019s tenure in the Oval Office.\n\nIt\u2019s long past time to revisit the \u201cemerging Democratic majority\u201d theory and, in the pages of National Journal this month, Judis did just that. He noted that the Democratic Party has continued to \u201chemorrhage\u201d white working-class voters at a pace that seems to have accelerated in the 13 years that have elapsed since EDM\u2019s publication. What\u2019s more, Republicans have surprised Judis by proving quite competitive among formerly disaffected Democratic voters in blue-collar and \u201clower-income service\u201d occupations. \u201cCall them middle-class Americans,\u201d Judis postulated.\n\nHe added that issues like the size of government and taxes have become key factors for voters in once reliably Democratic states like Maryland. \u201cSome Democrats tried to attribute [former Lt. Gov. Anthony] Brown\u2019s defeat to racism, but Brown was a bland technocrat in the mold of former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick,\u201d Judis noted. \u201cInstead, it appears that the [Maryland gubernatorial] election hinged on taxes and the size of government\u2014the questions to which middle-class voters so often seem to return.\u201d\n\nAfter the 2008 election, I thought Obama could create an enduring Democratic majority by responding aggressively to the Great Recession in the same way that Franklin Roosevelt had responded in 1933 to the Great Depression. Obama, I believed, would finally bury the Reagan Republican majority of 1980 and inaugurate a new period of Democratic domination. In retrospect, that analogy was clearly flawed. Roosevelt took power after four years of the Great Depression, with Republicans and business thoroughly discredited, and with the public (who lacked any safety net) ready to try virtually anything to revive the economy. Obama\u2019s situation was very different. Business was still powerful enough to threaten him if he went too far in trying to tame it. Much of the middle class and working class were still employed, and they saw Obama\u2019s stimulus program\u2014which was utterly necessary to stem the Great Recession\u2014as an expansion of government at their expense.\n\n\u2026\n\nIt now appears that, in some form, the Republican era which began in 1980 is still with us. Reagan Republicanism\u2014rooted in the long-standing American distrust of government, but perhaps with its roughest theocratic and insurrectionary edges sanded off for a national audience\u2014is still the default position of many of those Americans who regularly go to the polls. It can be effectively challenged when Republicans become identified with economic mismanagement or with military defeat. But after the memory of such disasters has faded, the GOP coalition has reemerged\u2014surprisingly intact and ready for battle.\n\n\u201cCoalitions are like water balloons,\u201d Real Clear Politics analyst Sean Trende wrote in 2013. \u201cYou push down on one side, and another side pops up.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe actions of the GOP might hurt it with some groups, but good analysis acknowledges that the same is true for Democrats,\u201d he continued. Trende has argued that American political coalitions come together and break apart regularly, and there is no such thing as a permanent anything in American politics. In The National Journal, Judis argues that Republicans are the beneficiaries of an \u201cemerging\u201d electoral \u201cadvantage.\u201d Republicans would be well-advised not to take Judis\u2019s word for it.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Nothing lasts forever.", "title": "John Judis: About that \u201cemerging Democratic majority\u2019 thing\u2026 yeah\u2026", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2015/02/02/john-judis-about-that-emerging-democratic-majority-thing-yeah/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@JazzShaw"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-02T15:31:30+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-02T15:10:30+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdde8\"", "article_summary": "John Judis: About that \u201cemerging Democratic majority\u2019 thing\u2026 yeah\u2026posted at 10:31 am on February 2, 2015 by Noah RothmanIn the 2002 book co-authored with Ruy Teixeira, John B.
