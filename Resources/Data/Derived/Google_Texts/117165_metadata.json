In comparison, less than 11 percent of the total legislation passed during the 1999-2000 Congress was confined to the lame-duck session, according to the data.\n\nDuring the most recent lame-duck, Congress passed the $1.1 trillion \"cromnibus\" spending bill to avert a government shutdown, pushed ahead a $585 billion defense policy bill and extended a slew of tax breaks, among other activities.\n\nIn total, the 113th Congress passed 296 laws: 13 more than the 112th Congress but fewer than each of the six previous legislative bodies, according to Pew.\n\nPew also found that the share of the total number of laws deemed \"substantive\" \u2014 legislation excluding ceremonial laws such as renaming buildings \u2014 has fallen to 64 percent, its lowest in 14 years.\n\nThe recently finished Congress was also historically unpopular, averaging 15 percent approval in 2014, according to Gallup, just 1 point above last year's all-time low set by the same Congress.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Lame-duck session saves outgoing Congress from ignominious fate.", "description": "Lame-duck session saves outgoing Congress from ignominious fate.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Jesse Byrnes", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Lame-duck session saves outgoing Congress from ignominious fate.", "title": "113th Congress avoids 'least productive' tag \u2014 but only barely", "url": "http://thehill.com/homenews/228177-113th-congress-barely-avoids-least-productive-tag", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:59:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:59-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/homenews/228177-113th-congress-barely-avoids-least-productive-tag", "dcterms.date": "2014-12-29T11:39-05:00", "dcterms.creator": "Niall Stanage", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "113th Congress, Gridlock,,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-29T11:39:34-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:59:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/homenews/228177-113th-congress-barely-avoids-least-productive-tag", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Lame-duck session saves outgoing Congress from ignominious fate.", "card": "summary", "title": "113th Congress avoids 'least productive' tag \u2014 but only barely"}, "dcterms.title": "113th Congress avoids 'least productive' tag \u2014 but only barely"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe303c\"", "article_summary": "In total, the 113th Congress passed 296 laws: 13 more than the 112th Congress but fewer than each of the six previous legislative bodies, according to Pew.\nADVERTISEMENTPew's final calculation , released Monday, found that the 113th Congress passed 38 percent of its laws, and 34 percent of so-called substantive legislation, during that period.\nThe 113th Congress narrowly avoided becoming the least productive in more than a decade by completing a rush of work at the last minute, according to the Pew Research Center.\nIn comparison, less than 11 percent of the total legislation passed during the 1999-2000 Congress was confined to the lame-duck session, according to the data.\nDuring the most recent lame-duck, Congress passed the $1.1 trillion \"cromnibus\" spending bill to avert a government shutdown, pushed ahead a $585 billion defense policy bill and extended a slew of tax breaks, among other activities."}
