The goal is to help institutions provide more services and treat more patients \u2014 particularly vulnerable populations \u2014 during an era of limited government funding.\n\n\u201cAs is the case with many administrative approaches, the initial intent of 340B was meritorious and would help offset the cost of hospital-based care of populations of patients who often have great needs and consume considerable resources,\u201d Donald L. Trump, MD, FACP, president and CEO of Roswell Park Cancer Institute and HemOnc Today\u2019s associate editor for medical oncology, said in an interview.\n\nSandra M. Swain\n\n\n\nWithout 340B, MedStar Washington Hospital Center would not have its cancer center, Sandra M. Swain, MD, FACP, medical director of Washington Cancer Institute at MedStar Washington Hospital Center and past president of ASCO, told HemOnc Today.\n\n\u201cThis is a very meaningful charity care policy that helps us offset our uncompensated care, the costs of which are pretty high here,\u201d Swain said. \u201cWe\u2019re able to take care of more patients because of the program.\u201d\n\nThe 340B program does not require participating facilities to pass along reduced drug prices to patients.\n\nSafety Net Hospitals for Pharmaceutical Access (SNHPA), a nonprofit organization that advocates for more than 1,000 health systems and hospitals that participate in the 340B program, conducted a survey of its members in February 2011. Sixty percent of SNHPA members responded to the survey.\n\nResults showed 74% of member safety net hospitals used the discounts to reduce drugs prices in their outpatient pharmacies. All of the hospitals surveyed reported that the savings derived from the 340B program were important to their operations, and 83% of respondents indicated the savings helped maintain broader operations, including nonpharmaceutical services. The hospitals surveyed saved an average of $5.2 million in 2010 with 340B.\n\nHospitals should have to declare how much money they made through the 340B Drug Pricing Program and what they have done to provide services to benefit underinsured and uninsured patients, said Jeffery C. Ward, MD, medical oncologist at Swedish Cancer Institute Edmonds. Source: Photo courtesy of Jeffery C. Ward, MD\n\nHowever, many physicians question whether the benefits derived by hospitals surpass 340B\u2019s original intentions.\n\n\u201cThe program was initially developed, depending on who you talk to, to either help pay for the care of the indigent patient, or to help the hospital that takes care of a lot of indigent patients be able to provide services,\u201d Jeffery C. Ward, MD, medical oncologist at Swedish Cancer Institute Edmonds, said in an interview. \u201cThat is a sticking point between hospitals and pharma.\u201d\n\nOthers say hospital-based benefits are an integral part of the 340B program.\n\n\u201cIt was created by a bipartisan Congress to help hospitals and other safety net providers that serve large numbers of low-income, vulnerable patients stretch their resources to help their vulnerable patient population,\u201d Robert A. Chapman, MD, director of the Josephine Ford Cancer Institute of the Henry Ford Health System in Detroit, told HemOnc Today. \u201cIt was never intended solely as a pass-through to the uninsured. To limit the program in this way would effectively kill it.\u201d\n\nCritics, however, suggest the financial benefits are a key contributor to the rapidly rising popularity of 340B. The number of participating hospitals nearly tripled in the past decade, increasing from 591 in 2005 to 1,673 \u2014 or one-third of all US hospitals \u2014 in 2011, according to ASCO\u2019s policy statement on 340B.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act (ACA) also expanded the definition of 340B-eligible entities to include free-standing cancer, community and critical access hospitals on the basis of their disproportionate share hospital (DSH) percentage. The total number of covered entities reached 16,572 in 2011, a twofold increase from 2001.\n\nDue to the ACA\u2019s expanded Medicaid rolls in certain states \u2014 a factor in the DSH percentage \u2014 many more hospitals might meet eligibility criteria.\n\n\u201cThere will be fewer uninsured patients to take care of, and more qualifying hospitals to reap rewards based on their Medicaid DSH percentage,\u201d said Ward, who chaired ASCO\u2019s Payment Reform Workgroup when ASCO developed its 340B statement. \u201cIn theory, there will be less need for 340B, and more hospitals that qualify.\u201d\n\nMergers and acquisitions\n\nThe availability of 340B drug discounts has dramatically altered oncology care in the United States.\n\n\u201cOncologists work in a myriad of settings, including national oncology practices, private practices, hospital-based practices and academia,\u201d Ward said. \u201cSome oncologists are able to work because of 340B, and some of them feel very threatened by 340B. But the real battle brewing is between qualifying hospitals and pharma, and it\u2019s a battle over big money.\u201d\n\nHospitals that participate in 340B often acquire community-based cancer centers to extend their discounts within these sites.\n\nA report published by Berkley Research Group, a consulting firm for pharmaceutical companies, indicated the number of physician-based oncology practices acquired by 340B hospitals and registered to the Office of Pharmacy Affairs database increased from 79 in 2009 to 166 in 2012.\n\n\u201cSome hospital systems have used 340B for the acquisition of practices in order to make money on the margin from this pricing program,\u201d Samuel M. Silver, MD, PhD, MACP, FASCO, professor of internal medicine at the University of Michigan and HemOnc Today\u2019s Health Policy and Value of Care section editor, said in an interview. \u201cIt was a business opportunity, and it is certainly an attractive economic driver for practice acquisitions that continues today.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Berkley report, 340B chargebacks for oncology-related products increased 250% between 2009 and 2012 due to acquisitions, new covered entity enrollments and increased prices. Further, 89% of acquired sites were located in areas with higher median income than the 340B hospital.\n\nThese data have prompted some to question whether acquiring hospitals are looking for profit.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think 340B hospitals by and large are poaching practices,\u201d Ward said. \u201cHospitals are not deliberately seeking out oncology practices in wealthy communities to buy. Those practices had already chosen to be in wealthy areas. You don\u2019t find private oncology practices in low-income and distressed communities. You find them where the practice would do well.\u201d\n\nThere may be positives on both sides of the equation, Diaz said.\n\nPhysician-based practices face financial strain due to lower reimbursements from the Medicare Modernization Act (MMA), cuts from CMS based on reductions in physician fee schedules, and sequestration.", "article_metadata": {"site_name": "healiotwo", "description": "Hemonc Today | The 340B Drug Pricing Program makes life-saving treatments available to low-income, uninsured and underinsured patients at extreme discounts.", "og": {"image": "http://i3.wyanokecdn.com/healio_safe_image.png"}, "designators": "perspective", "designator": "perspective", "PostedDate": "2014-08-25", "msvalidate.01": "AB0F11E889D663098DB556BB5ACBB719", "page_type": "Document", "content_type": "News Article", "google-site-verification": "TCYGZWR7Qscjc3GO_imiutAfXMSCFLpchm8rXzIk-5M", "VIcurrentDateTime": 635997884780402741, "content_version": 3, "pageid": "{BAFC7C5D-E4CF-43CD-882F-C3C42CC020E0}", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ModifiedDate": "2014-10-07"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb82a\"", "article_summary": "\u201cOncologists work in a myriad of settings, including national oncology practices, private practices, hospital-based practices and academia,\u201d Ward said.\n\u201cThat is a sticking point between hospitals and pharma.\u201dOthers say hospital-based benefits are an integral part of the 340B program.\nProponents contend the program \u2014 created as part of the 1992 Public Health Service Act \u2014 greatly improved access to comprehensive cancer care.\nCover Story PerspectiveThe 340B Drug Pricing Program makes life-saving treatments available to low-income, uninsured and underinsured patients at extreme discounts.\n\u201cWe\u2019re able to take care of more patients because of the program.\u201dThe 340B program does not require participating facilities to pass along reduced drug prices to patients."}
