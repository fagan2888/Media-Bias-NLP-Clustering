Geoff Duncan was host of the event at the Coal Mountain Park Community Building. District 25 state Rep. Mike Dudgeon, who led the first session, moderated.\n\nWhile many in the audience questioned the benefits the proposed city, tentatively called Sharon Springs, would bring to those not within its limits, they also suggested other options.\n\nThose included how residents elect the county commission, its makeup and potentially consolidating the governments of Cumming and Forsyth.\n\nBoth legislators made their opinions clear about a yes or no vote for Sharon Springs \u2014 they can\u2019t make one yet.\n\nThe point of these town hall meetings, Duncan said, is to foster discussion among residents, commissioners and elected officials. His legislative district includes parts of the proposed second city and north Forsyth.\n\n\u201cThis gives us an opportunity to really hear what people want to say, whether they\u2019re for or against [an issue],\u201d Duncan said.\n\nWhat is Sharon Springs?\n\nEric Crump, co-founder of the Sharon Springs Alliance, said the new municipality would be a \u201ccity light,\u201d meaning it would provide just three services \u2014 planning and zoning, code enforcement and solid waste disposal. That\u2019s the minimum number of services required by the Georgia Constitution.\n\nThe goal of the city, Crump said, would be to alleviate concerns that south Forsyth is growing at a faster rate and into a different lifestyle than the county\u2019s north end.\n\nBut the goal of the alliance, according to Crump, is not to push the immediate formation of Sharon Springs. The nonprofit is focused instead on research and raising funds to support a third-party feasibility study to determine the costs, practicality and benefits of a new city.\n\nThe study, for which the alliance is close to its fundraising goal, would be conducted by the Carl Vinson Institute of the University of Georgia, one of the two groups endorsed by the Georgia Assembly.\n\nThe proposed map for Sharon Springs follows the southern boundaries of the Fulton-Forsyth line and western boundaries to Ga. 400 from the Fulton County line to Cumming city limits.\n\nThe new city would reach north to Cumming, following Ga. 20 south to Samples Road and continuing along Haw Creek Road to the Chattahoochee River. Eastern boundaries follow the river to meet the southern border.\n\nThe approximate area, according to an alliance map, totals 44 square miles, or 27,900 acres. There is one fire station within the proposed area, with three others near the border.\n\nProvided services and borders could entirely change, Duncan noted. The study should show what\u2019s best, whether that\u2019s a different version or no Sharon Springs at all.\n\nConcerns aired from opponents included a tax increase, duplication of services, lost revenue from the county that would be funneled into the city and a sliding scale leading to more small cities.\n\nHow should we vote for commissioners?\n\nOther options brought up included the potential consolidation of Cumming and Forsyth into a single government, modeled after the success of similar efforts in Athens-Clarke County and Macon.\n\nHowever, Duncan pointed out, this change would require a vote by the residents of the proposed city, as well as a vote by the county. Residents in the cities that have consolidated were motivated by a bad economic situation, which Cumming does not have.\n\nWith or without a merge, how residents vote for their county commissioners was a concern.\n\nAlthough Forsyth voters chose in 2008 to elect commissioners by district-only balloting, many south Forsyth residents are unhappy that commissioners they cannot vote for have the power to decide matters in any district.\n\nDudgeon, whose district would fall almost entirely within the Sharon Springs\u2019 boundaries, said the makeup of Forsyth is unlike any other county in the state with a population of at least 150,000. That makeup is five district-elected commissioners, five city councilmen and one mayor of a small city municipality.\n\nTravis Jarrard, a government teacher at North Forsyth High School, said he likes the fact that only he and others in his district can vote for their commissioner.\n\nThe minority \u2014 north Forsyth \u2014 still has representation within the current system, even if it\u2019s just one vote. With countywide voting, he said, the majority \u2014 south Forsyth \u2014 would have unequal pull.\n\nThe third and final town hall meeting will take place Nov. 18. Incoming state Sen. Michael Williams will serve as host.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.forsythnews.com/archives/26085/", "image": "http://media.morristechnology.com/webmedia/upload/forsythnews/article/2014/11/07/town.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "NORTH FORSYTH \u2014 A second town hall meeting on Forsyth County\u2019s future and government structure attracted a smaller crowd whose geographic makeup was starkly different yet no less engaged.", "title": "Second town hall talk on government draws crowd in north Forsyth"}, "robots": "noarchive", "title": "Second town hall talk on government draws crowd in north Forsyth"}, "article_summary": "NORTH FORSYTH \u2014 A second town hall meeting on Forsyth County\u2019s future and government structure attracted a smaller crowd whose geographic makeup was starkly different yet no less engaged.\nResidents of north Forsyth gathered Wednesday night to discuss issues with the possibility of forming a new city, what would be the county\u2019s second, in south Forsyth.\nHis legislative district includes parts of the proposed second city and north Forsyth.\nThe minority \u2014 north Forsyth \u2014 still has representation within the current system, even if it\u2019s just one vote.\nBoth legislators made their opinions clear about a yes or no vote for Sharon Springs \u2014 they can\u2019t make one yet."}
