Bob Menendez, D-N.J., has pushed back against the White House\u2019s criticism of lawmakers who are pursuing additional sanctions against Iran. In an interview with NPR last week, he said comments by White House Press Secretary Jay Carney that additional sanctions were a \u201cmarch to war\u201d were \u201cover the top\u201d and \u201cfear mongering.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs one of the architects of the sanctions regime we've had on Iran, this is exactly the process that has brought Iran to the negotiating table,\u201d Menendez said on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d Sunday, elaborating on his comments. He said putting sanctions in place six months after the enactment of the deal would create \u201cflexibility for diplomacy\u201d and send the message to Iran \u201cthat there is a consequence\u201d for failing to reach a longer-term deal to end their nuclear weapons ambitions.\n\n\u201cCreating a sanctions regime that is an insurance policy and also creates leverage for us is incredibly important,\u201d Menendez said. Among his concerns with the deal are a failure to define what a \u201cmutually-agreeable enrichment program\u201d is, and softening from with the U.N. Security Council Resolutions that call on Iran to cease its enrichment entirely.\n\n\u201cThose are real concerns,\u201d Menendez said. \u201cI hope the deal can be successfully. Obviously, diplomacy is something we want to see work. But we need to be ready to move forward.\u201d\n\nThe top ranking Republican member on the committee, Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., discussed his own concerns about the deal, including the fact that it does not require Iran to dismantle any centrifuges in the next six months.\n\n\n\n\u201cI'm very concerned, especially with this interim deal, how we get to a place where Iran is not enriching constantly or where they're right on the verge, always, of being able to break out and create a nuclear weapon. I have strong concerns about the proliferation that's going to occur in the area,\u201d he said.\n\nAllowing Iran to continue enriching uranium \u201creally throws into disarray\u201d other nuclear agreements the U.S. is negotiating around the world, Corker said, adding \u201cThat is something that cannot exist.\u201d\n\nCorker said that he and Menendez will be working on a Congressional response to the deal, but that it will be up to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., to decide whether it goes anywhere. Reid has said Congress will be looking at whether the deal is a \u201cgood enough first step.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s clear many lawmakers are frustrated.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is a total victory from their standpoint,\u201d Corker said in reference to Iran. \u201cI think they're going to be good actors over the next six months. Because they see an administration who led this negotiation, an administration that has already given tilt to allowing them to do the things that the world community, through the U.N. Security Council, has already said they cannot do. So I'm very discouraged.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The top lawmakers on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee are worried about Iran&#039;s potential to keep enriching uranium", "og": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/sens-menendez-corker-express-strong-reservations-about-iran-deal/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/12/01/9d65f506-6911-4647-a81b-f37dd9717786/thumbnail/1200x630/f08ebd15ea8fe72592784e46368734c3/FTN_Menendez_121.jpg", "height": 630}, "type": "article", "description": "The top lawmakers on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee are worried about Iran's potential to keep enriching uranium", "title": "Sens.
