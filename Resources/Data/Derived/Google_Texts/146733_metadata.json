And how does a freelancing \"newbie\" sign up for Obamacare on the website without a steady, weekly paycheck as documentation?\n\nThe Huffington Post has offered a short list of steps that might prove very beneficial for the new surge in the American freelancing community. Since the Healthcare.gov website was not implemented with the utmost efficiency in the early days of the rollout, the signup process has been severely hampered. The original estimate by the Obama Administration was for 3 million enrollees by Jan 1, instead of the 2 million that they have received. Luckily, this gives the novice freelancer a bit more time to weigh their options.\n\nAccording to Allena Tapia of the Huffington Post, freelancing professionals may not need to sign up through the Obamacare website at all. Each state has a network of healthcare insurance brokers and agents who might be better able to provide freelancers with an even lower rate. Other freelancing professionals may be exempt from the new law entirely. Subsidies and financial assistance are also available, but Tapia warns to pay close attention to freelancing fluctuations in income during 2014 in order to remain eligible.\n\nAs many Americans begin their first freelancing business, learning how to manage numerous social media sites, multiple email addresses, cumbersome budgeting spreadsheets, and strange new invoicing software, they are also faced with the challenges of taxes and healthcare.
