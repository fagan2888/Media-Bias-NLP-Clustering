Moments before he started chemotherapy at a local health facility, however, he was informed that his insurance wouldn't cover the costs of his cancer treatment because of an existing heart condition.\n\n\"One of the workers came and said, 'I need to talk to you,' and so I went and talked to her and she says, 'We found out that your insurance does not include chemo,'\" Angran told WHO TV.\n\nSince then, Angran and his wife, Diana, have had to pay for the cancer treatment out of their pockets and are now $50,000 in debt.\n\nThe couple said they signed up for health insurance under Obamacare but they are now worried about the $850 a month price tag, which they say they cannot afford and won't become effective until April.\n\nPastor Angran said he is now afraid for his wife.\n\n\"We ask for prayer. You know, prayer is the most powerful thing I think anyone can have,\" Angran said.\n\nHe also decried Obamacare, arguing that there is no compassion in the healthcare law.\n\n\"I'm sitting here with Stage 3 esophageal cancer and they're taking me to the finance person and saying, 'How are you going to pay for this?'\" he said.\n\nThe Christian Post reached out to Angran's church for comment on their pastor's condition Wednesday, but there was no response.\n\nIn the meantime, he reportedly can no longer swallow. He eats through a feeding tube and is unable to take essential heart medication due to his condition.\n\nObamacare requires most Americans to acquire some form of health insurance by March 31, according to CNBC. Failure to abide by the requirements of the law can attract a penalty of up-to 1 percent of total taxable income.\n\nWHO TV", "article_metadata": {"Description": "An Iowa pastor diagnosed with Stage 3 esophageal cancer in January is now asking for prayers to help pay for his new $850 a month health insurance he signed up for under Obamacare.", "Copyright": "2016 Christian Post", "Title": "Iowa Pastor Suffering From Cancer Finds $850 a Month Obamacare Health Insurance Difficult to Pay; Asks for Prayers", "og": {"site_name": "Christian Post", "description": "An Iowa pastor diagnosed with Stage 3 esophageal cancer in January is now asking for prayers to help pay for his new $850 a month health insurance he signed up for under Obamacare.", "title": "Iowa Pastor Suffering From Cancer Finds $850 a Month Obamacare Health Insurance Difficult to Pay; Asks for Prayers", "url": "http://www.christianpost.com/news/iowa-pastor-suffering-from-cancer-finds-850-a-month-obamacare-health-insurance-difficult-to-pay-asks-for-prayers-116400/", "image": "http://images.christianpost.com/full/70602/tony-angran.png", "author": "Leonardo Blair", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ChristianPost", "image": "http://images.christianpost.com/full/70602/tony-angran.png", "description": "An Iowa pastor diagnosed with Stage 3 esophageal cancer in January is now asking for prayers to help pay for his new $850 a month health insurance he signed up for under Obamacare.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Iowa Pastor Suffering From Cancer Finds $850 a Month Obamacare Health Insurance Difficult to Pay; Asks for Prayers"}, "syndication-source": "http://www.christianpost.com/news/iowa-pastor-suffering-from-cancer-finds-850-a-month-obamacare-health-insurance-difficult-to-pay-asks-for-prayers-116400/", "robots": "index, follow", "bt": {"keywords": "Obamacare,Health&20Insurance,Solid&20Rock&20Church&20of&20God,Esophageal&20Cancer,Iowa,christian&20news,christianity,evangelical", "pubDate": "2014-03-19T12:13:19-04:00", "modDate": "2014-03-19T12:13:19-04:00"}, "msvalidate.01": "29BD7F6D752EB52F5F8F8ACEF4AC6689", "fb": {"page_id": 41093998634, "app_id": 968308226558745}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "Googlebot-news": "index, follow", "Keywords": "Obamacare, Health Insurance, Solid Rock Church of God, Esophageal Cancer, Iowa,christian news,christianity,evangelical", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0d59\"", "article_summary": "Obamacare requires most Americans to acquire some form of health insurance by March 31, according to CNBC.\nThe Christian Post reached out to Angran's church for comment on their pastor's condition Wednesday, but there was no response.\nThe couple said they signed up for health insurance under Obamacare but they are now worried about the $850 a month price tag, which they say they cannot afford and won't become effective until April.\n, Christian Post Reporter By Leonardo Blair Christian Post Reporter(Photo: Screen Grab via WHO TV)An Iowa pastor diagnosed with Stage 3 esophageal cancer in January is now asking for prayers to help pay for his new $850 a month health insurance he signed up for under Obamacare.\nSince then, Angran and his wife, Diana, have had to pay for the cancer treatment out of their pockets and are now $50,000 in debt."}
