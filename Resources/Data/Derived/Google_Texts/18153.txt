The Ohio attorney general says an investigation has found that aborted fetuses from Planned Parenthood facilities are ultimately disposed of in landfills.

“The vast majority of the documents showed they were going to landfills,” Dan Tierney, a spokesman for Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine’s office, told The Blaze. “Planned Parenthood cooperated with the investigation, and that is what the findings revealed.

“Basically what the disagreement is whether disposing of fetuses is humane or not,” he added. “The law requires that fetuses be disposed in a humane manner. Attorney General DeWine believes that putting a fetus in a landfill is not humane.”

Stephanie Kight, president and chief executive officer of Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio, refuted the claim, The Blaze reported.

“Planned Parenthood contracts with vendors to handle fetal tissue in a respectful manner and in accordance with the law. It is irresponsible for the AG to say otherwise,” she said.

Mr. DeWine announced the investigation in July after the Center for Medical Progress released a series of undercover videos they said showed Planned Parenthood executives negotiating the sale of fetal organs. He said the investigation found no evidence that Planned Parenthood made money from aborted fetuses, The Associated Press reported.
