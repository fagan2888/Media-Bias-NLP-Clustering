But the impact will not be major.\n\nMicroTek CEO Anne Paradis said the company was able to renew its health coverage for January and offer the same two plans it has previously. The new rates are not unusually high.\n\n\u201cEvery year when we renew our health insurance, it goes up. This year was no different,\u201d Paradis said. \u201cIt was a manageable amount that we could absorb between asking employees to contribute a bit more and having the company contributing a bit more.\u201d\n\nNew data from the Associated Industries of Massachusetts, a business trade group, indicates MicroTek\u2019s experience is not unusual. Many businesses are seeing only small increases or even decreases in their premiums.\n\n\n\nOthers, however, are not so fortunate. The preliminary data from AIM, one of the earliest indicators of the impact of the Affordable Care Act on actual insurance premiums being offered to businesses, show the Affordable Care Act has caused significant variability in premiums.\n\nWhile some businesses will actually see a small decrease in premiums, a greater number of businesses are seeing their premiums rise by 10 to 29 percent, and a few are seeing even greater spikes.\n\n\u201cThese numbers are pretty much in line with what we\u2019ve been expecting and certainly with what the health insurance companies developed in their modeling,\u201d said Christopher Geehern, a spokesman for AIM.\n\nAIM is conducting a survey of its members to determine the effect of the Affordable Care Act on insurance premiums for those businesses that must renew their plans in January, the first time parts of the the new law will be in effect. The group will conduct an additional survey in March, since many small businesses renew their premiums in April.\n\nSo far, the group has received 101 responses from businesses buying insurance in the small group market. Although the number is too small for a scientific sample, it does provide some early indication of what businesses will see going forward.\n\nOf those, Geehern said, 59 percent of businesses are seeing their premiums increase, 27 percent are seeing their premiums decrease and 14 percent are seeing their premiums remain flat. Since health insurance premiums typically increase every year, the most notable thing about the results is how variable those changes are.\n\nAll of those who saw their premiums decrease saw drops of less than 9 percent, Geehern said. The increases were more variable.\n\nAmong all respondents, 27 percent saw their premiums increase by less than 9 percent; 17 percent increased between 10 and 19 percent; 13 percent increased between 20 and 29 percent; and 2 percent increased between 30 and 49 percent.\n\n\n\nThe variability worries businesses who will not get renewal notices until later this year.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re expecting the worst,\u201d said Kate Putnam, president of Package Machinery in Holyoke. \u201cAs a small employer with older employees, it\u2019s not going to look pretty, and we\u2019ve heard the rumors that there could be a 50 percent increase in insurance rates.\u201d\n\nAmong those survey respondents who will see increases, 40 percent said they plan to make changes to their health-insurance offerings. Of those, 30 percent will increase deductibles or co-pays and 18 percent plan to drop coverage altogether, according to AIM. (The option of dropping coverage will become more difficult in 2015 once the employer mandate kicks in.)\n\nThe basic cost of an average Massachusetts health plan is not rising significantly in 2014. According to information released in August by the state Division of Insurance, the average base rate for health-insurance premiums in the individual and small group market will increase by just 1.9 percent in the first quarter of 2014.\n\nHowever, the base rate only reflects the actual cost of health care, plus fees and taxes. Insurance premiums also reflect factors unique to the person or group buying insurance \u2013 things like age, family composition and the number of people in an insurance pool.\n\nIt is in those additional factors where the Affordable Care Act will affect different businesses in different ways. Business groups have warned for months that changes in the way insurers use \u201crating factors\u201d to calculate premiums will cause rate swings, similar to what AIM is seeing in its survey.\n\nMassachusetts\u2019 2007 health-care reform let insurers use 11 rating factors when determining the cost of a health plan for an individual or small group \u2014 things like age, industry, participation in a wellness plan, the size of the group insured by the plan and the use of a group purchasing cooperative. The Affordable Care Act requires insurers to use just four factors: age, geography, tobacco use and family composition. The state asked for a waiver from the change, but was only granted a three-year transition period.\n\nState insurance commissioner Joseph Murphy said Massachusetts has not done a formal survey to collect information about final premium prices. So there is no comprehensive data available yet about prices for Massachusetts insurance plans in 2014.\n\nMurphy said, however, premiums will vary based on the characteristics of the group, including factors such as age, size and how the group was rated in the past. He said smaller businesses, those with one to five employees, are likely to see rates decrease, while companies with 25 to 50 employees could see increases.\n\nMurphy said businesses that see increases, or are worried about increases, should shop around. \u201cIf they saw a modest premium increase, they can always talk to their broker or go to the exchange and look at whatever options might be available to them to mitigate potential increases,\u201d Murphy said.\n\nGeehern said the ratings factors are \u201cthe largest single part\u201d of the variability.\n\nJim Kessler, general counsel at Health New England in Springfield, said another factor impacting premiums is \u201clist billing.\u201d Previously, Health New England would base insurance rates on the average age of a company\u2019s employees. It would estimate that every family had two and a fraction children.\n\nNow, the Affordable Care Act requires insurers to calculate every individual\u2019s premium based on actual age and family size and base a company\u2019s premiums on that.\n\nSo, for example, a small company with lots of large families will see higher premiums.\n\n\u201cThe change in rating methodology means there are winners and losers,\u201d Kessler said. \u201cIt\u2019s what we expected going in and what we\u2019ve seen as rates have come out.\u201d\n\nJeffrey Ciuffreda, president of the Affiliated Chambers of Commerce of Greater Springfield, said the chamber is hearing anecdotally from brokers similar results to what AIM found. The Springfield chamber was one of 25 business groups which recently asked the Massachusetts congressional delegation for a waiver from the ratings factor change.\n\nCiuffreda said he believes some of the increases are also due to a provision in the law that requires insurers to set rates annually, rather than quarterly, as Massachusetts has been doing, causing insurers to be more conservative with their cost estimates.\n\nCiuffreda said the most difficult part is not the rate increases, with many businesses seeing small increases or decreases, but the uncertainty facing businesses that do not know what costs will be.\n\n\u201cWe had a system that was working, and now we\u2019re going into a different system and we\u2019re not sure it\u2019s going to work or not,\u201d Ciuffreda said. \u201cThat makes it very difficult for businesses to do a five-year plan.\u201d\n\nDave Ratner, owner of Agawam-based Dave's Soda and Pet City, which has 130 employees, said he worries rates will \u201cgo sky high\u201d when the company renews its plan in September due to the rating factor change because small businesses will no longer be able to use buying cooperatives to stay competitive with big businesses.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen is all the good work that the state has done in the last seven years since Romneycare\u2019s been in is going to come unraveled,\u201d Ratner said.\n\nDeputy insurance commissioner Kevin Beagan said the state understands that some businesses may look at self-insuring their companies or other means to cut costs.\n\n\u201cObviously, the result we\u2019re not looking for is for people to drop coverage,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to find ways keep it as affordable as possible.\u201d\n\nBeagan pointed to the state\u2019s request for a waiver from the ratings factor change and to additional tools, such as participation in wellness programs, that are available to help mitigate cost increases.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "affordable-care-act, associated-industries-of-massachusetts, boston, business-monday, chris-geehern, dave-ratner, health-care, health-insurance, kate-putnam, obamacare, news", "title": "Associated Industries of Massachusetts survey finds huge variability in health insurance premium changes under 'Obamacare'", "og": {"site_name": "masslive.com", "description": "The Associated Industries of Massachusetts surveyed 101 small businesses.
