A World War II veteran and Arvada resident was presented Monday with a medal commemorating his time as a prisoner of war.

In December 1944, Technical Sgt. Frank Dechant was serving in an Army infantry unit when he was captured by Nazi forces during the Battle of the Bulge.

Dechant’s son, Dave, said his father was “greatly humbled” by the award.

“He is a man who never sought the spotlight, so it was great for the family to see him recognized in this way,” Dave Dechant said.

Dechant, like many who have experienced the horrors of war, kept his tales to himself, his son said. The family always knew he was a hero, and they were proud to see him honored, he said.

Dechant, now 91, was held in Stalag VIII-A, in what is now Poland, and was forced to march to an unknown location in Germany.

He was liberated in April 1945, weighing less than 100 pounds. He served in the Army until February 1946.

Dechant has received numerous medals and commendations, including the Bronze Star, the Good Conduct Medal, the American Campaign Medal, the European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal with three bronze service stars, the World War II Victory Medal and the Combat Infantryman Badge.

The ceremony, before family and friends, was held at the office of U.S. Rep. Ed Perlmutter. Perlmutter’s office was contacted by Dechant’s nephew for assistance in obtaining the POW medal.

Perlmutter and retired Air Force Lt. Col. Jerry Stecklein — Dechant’s nephew — presented the POW medal to the technical sergeant.

“Sgt. Dechant is a hero who courageously served our nation,” Perlmutter said. “It’s a special privilege to be with his family today to honor him and present him with this medal to recognize his sacrifice and service in defense of our freedom.”
