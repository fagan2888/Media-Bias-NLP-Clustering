Athena Orchard was not even a teen when she was diagnosed with an aggressive form of osteosarcoma, a commmon type of bone cancer and the sixth most common cancer found in children, which killed her when she was just 13. Although her family experienced overwhelming sadness throughout her illness, it was only when her parents, Dean and Caroline Orchard, began to sort through her belongings that they felt the deepest pain. As The Telegraph reported, it was only then they discovered the true thoughts and feelings of their sweet girl. She\u2019d secretly been writing a 3,000-word message to her family on the back of her bedroom mirror.\n\n\u201cLove is like the wind. You can feel it, but you can't see it. I\u2019m waiting to fall in love with someone I can open my heart to.\u201d -Athena Orchard\n\nHer stay-at-home mother described her daughter to the Daily Mirror as \u201cbeautiful and athletic\u201d and \u201cthe bravest person I know.\u201d \u201cWe knew that Athena loved to write, that was part of who she was, it made her happy,\u201d her mother Caroline, 37, explained to The Telegraph. \u201cWe\u2019re keeping the mirror forever, it is a part of her we can keep in the house, it will always be in her room.\u201d\n\n\u201cLife is only bad if you make it bad.\u201d -Athena Orchard\n\nHer father, Dean, 33, is the one who discovered the secret message along with a box full of songs Athena had written in her bedroom at their house in Leicester, England. \u201cIt was a stand-up mirror in her room, and it was always lent up against the wall so we never saw behind it,\u201d Dean told The Telegraph. \u201cWhen I moved the mirror after she died I couldn\u2019t believe it, I saw all this writing\u2026 I started reading it, but before long I had to stop because it was too much. It was heartbreaking.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe it's not about the happy ending, maybe it's about the story.\u201d -Athena OrchardJust before Christmas, Athena had collapsed in the kitchen of her family\u2019s home. Rushed to the hospital, an emergency seven-and-a-half hour operation removed a tumor on her spine. This was followed by months of chemotherapy targeting the disease which had spread to her shoulder and head. Eventually, she lost her hair and a great deal of strength. Her family said the one she never lost was her positive outlook. Reading her words, it is clear the world is less bright for the passing of this gentle spirit.\n\n\u201cPeople gonna hate you, rate you, break you, but how strong you stand, that\u2019s what makes you\u2026 you!\u201d -Athena Orchard", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "osteosarcoma, athena orchard, bone cancer, childhood cancer, secret message", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Athena Orchard, 13, who recently died of bone cancer, left a hopeful message behind for her heartbroken family.", "title": "The Wisdom Of This 13-Year-Old Probably Surpasses Your Own", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/teen-who-died-osteosarcoma-leaves-behind-hopeful-message-her-family-286972", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/06/athena-orchard.JPG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Athena Orchard, 13, who recently died of bone cancer, left a hopeful message behind for her heartbroken family.", "title": "The Wisdom Of This 13-Year-Old Probably Surpasses Your Own", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/teen-who-died-osteosarcoma-leaves-behind-hopeful-message-her-family-286972", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/06/athena-orchard.JPG", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/06/athena-orchard.JPG"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Conditions", "published_time": "2014-06-06T17:18:35-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-06T17:18:34-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Athena Orchard, 13, who recently died of bone cancer, left a hopeful message behind for her heartbroken family."}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5b8b\"", "article_summary": "\u201cPeople gonna hate you, rate you, break you, but how strong you stand, that\u2019s what makes you\u2026 you!\u201d -Athena Orchard\nShe\u2019d secretly been writing a 3,000-word message to her family on the back of her bedroom mirror.\nAthena Orchard was not even a teen when she was diagnosed with an aggressive form of osteosarcoma, a commmon type of bone cancer and the sixth most common cancer found in children, which killed her when she was just 13.\nAs The Telegraph reported, it was only then they discovered the true thoughts and feelings of their sweet girl.\n\u201cHappiness is a direction, not a destination.\u201dWhat could be more sad than a child facing down a terminal illness?"}
