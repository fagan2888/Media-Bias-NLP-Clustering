Have you ever given a dollar to a beggar? You remember, I’m sure. You were walking downtown and this bedraggled old man shuffled up to you with his hand out. You could have said “No” and walked away, but you didn’t. You reached into your pocket or your purse and you gave him a five dollar bill. That’s called charity.
