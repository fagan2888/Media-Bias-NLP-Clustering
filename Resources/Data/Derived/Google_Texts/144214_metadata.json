Carr ran just once for a 2-yard loss and he didn't return.\n\nLindsay hurt his ribs, but kept playing. Powell finished with 58 yards on 15 carries.\n\nMacIntyre said it's too early to tell the severity of the injuries to Adkins and Carr.\n\nGillam out\n\nBuffs linebacker Addison Gillam missed the game with a knee injury. The junior was injured during the Sept. 12 game against Massachusetts, and the Buffs expect him to miss at least one more game.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We're shooting for Arizona State (on Oct. 10) or Oregon (on Oct. 3),\" MacIntyre said of Gillam's potential return. \"He had his knee scoped and hopefully he'll be back in two more weeks.\"\n\nAlthough Gillam dealt with some minor injuries in 2014, this is just the second time in his career he's missed a game, and the first he missed because of injury. He missed one game last year with an illness.\n\nFirst TD\n\nReceiver Devin Ross got the first touchdown of his career, catching a 24-yard pass from quarterback Sefo Liufau early in the third quarter.\n\n\"It was only one of the best feelings of my life. For real,\" Ross said. \"I really loved that moment and wish I could relive it again right now. It was just so amazing. I'm just glad we got that win. It was the best game I've ever played in my life. It was just fun and exciting.\"\n\nNotable\n\nCU improved to 6-7 all-time in overtime games and snapped a three-game skid in overtime games.
