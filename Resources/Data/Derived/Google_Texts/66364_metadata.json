Kansas Judicial Branch\n\nThe Kansas Senate just passed a bill that would give the state\u2019s judicial branch $2 million in additional funding for the year. But the legislation contains some interesting fine print.\n\nBill Raftery, who blogs at Gavel to Gavel, notes that embedded in the bill are several policy changes that would give local courts more control over drafting their budgets and picking chief judges for their districts, shifting power away from the state\u2019s supreme court. The bill would also allow judicial vacancies to remain open for weeks longer than current law permits.\n\nAnd not only that, the bill contains a non-severability clause that would invalidate the entire measure \u2014 including the funding \u2014 if \u201cany provision of this act is stayed or is held to be invalid or unconstitutional.\u201d\n\nIn other words, writes Mr. Raftery, \u201cIf the state supreme court were to strike down as unconstitutional ANY provision of supplemental funding bill HB 2338 (such as those removing the supreme court\u2019s power over budgeting or appointing chief judges in the state) the funding would be eliminated.\u201d\n\nThe legislation passed the Senate on Thursday by a vote of 23 to 12. The lower chamber has yet to take it up.\n\nLaw Blog reached out to the main Senate sponsor of the bill for comment.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "The Kansas Senate just passed a bill that would give the state's judicial branch $2 million in additional funding for the year.
