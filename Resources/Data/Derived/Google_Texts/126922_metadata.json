The 49-year-old Republican from California, who was elected today, will occupy far more of the political spotlight than previously, in this midterm election year and in the lead-up to 2016.\n\nMcCarthy, currently serving his fourth term in Congress, is \u201ca Californian of moderate temperament who is likely to be more of a preserver of the status quo\u2026 than the conservative firebrand many from the party\u2019s right flank had hoped to promote,\u201d The New York Times reported this afternoon.\n\nRelated: Meet David Brat, The New Tea Party Giant-Killer\n\nHe steps into the leadership role occupied by Cantor, who in a dramatic upset lost his seat last week in the GOP primary in Virginia to Tea Party loyalist David Brat, an economics professor. Brat spent just over $200,000 to score the upset.\n\nClose friends with Cantor, McCarthy is said to have a \u201cdeep network of supporters and deputy whips,\u201d according to The Washington Post, which also refers to him as \u201ca strong fundraiser with a tireless work ethic.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you finally sit down across the table and deal with Democrats, it's a political deal, not a policy debate or discussion that one side persuades the other,\" Rep. Tom Cole (R-OK) told The Wall Street Journal. \"It's who can put together a compromise. Kevin is very, very good at those sorts of things.\"\n\nHere are a few other insights into McCarthy:\n\nHe\u2019s the first Republican in his immediate family and a fourth-generation resident of Kern County, in the southern end of California\u2019s Central Valley.\n\nHe won $5,000 in a scratch-off lottery in California as a teenager.\n\nUsing that money, he opened his first business, Kevin O\u2019s Deli, and ended up selling it to attend California State University in Bakersfield.\n\nHe earned a B.S. degree in marketing in 1989 and an MBA in 1994.\n\nHe and his wife, Judy, have two children, Connor and Meghan, and live in Bakersfield.\n\nAs a freshman congressman, he was appointed to the GOP Steering Committee, and in 2008, John Boehner appointed him chair of the GOP Platform Committee, which produced the Republican Party\u2019s platform for 2008.\n\nHe was one of three founding members of the GOP's so-called Young Guns (along with Eric Cantor and Paul Ryan), created to chart the GOP's future.\n\nHe served as the GOP\u2019s House chief deputy whip from Jan. 2009 to Jan. 2011.\n\nHe served as House majority whip from Jan. 2011 to June 2014.\n\nHe ranks \u201cin the lowest fifth among House members in terms of wealth, according to his financial disclosure statements and an analysis by the Center for Responsive Politics,\u201d AP reported late last week. \u201cHis 2012 disclosure showed his net worth between $78,000 and $296,000, with his $174,000 congressional salary supplemented from dividends from a variety of mutual and money market funds.\u201d\n\nSources: The New York Times, The Washington Post, AP, Wikipedia, The Wall Street Journal.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Who is Kevin McCarthy, the guy who replaced Eric Cantor as majority leader of the Hous", "title": "Kevin McCarthy: 10 Things You Didn\u2019t Know About Him", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/06/19/Kevin-McCarthy-10-Things-You-Didn-t-Know-About-Him", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/06192014_Kevin_Mccarthy.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/06/19/Kevin-McCarthy-10-Things-You-Didn-t-Know-About-Him", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/06192014_Kevin_Mccarthy.jpg", "creator": "@maurmack", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Who is Kevin McCarthy, the guy who replaced Eric Cantor as majority leader of the Hous", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Who is Kevin McCarthy, the guy who replaced Eric Cantor as majority leader of the House of Representatives?\nHe served as the GOP\u2019s House chief deputy whip from Jan. 2009 to Jan. 2011.\nUsing that money, he opened his first business, Kevin O\u2019s Deli, and ended up selling it to attend California State University in Bakersfield.\nKevin is very, very good at those sorts of things.\"\nThe 49-year-old Republican from California, who was elected today, will occupy far more of the political spotlight than previously, in this midterm election year and in the lead-up to 2016."}
