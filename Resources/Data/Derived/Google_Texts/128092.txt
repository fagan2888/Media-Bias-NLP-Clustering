After a multiple sclerosis diagnosis caused Bill MacNally to retire early from his position as an Allina Health senior vice president, he realized something.

“I’ve been given the gift of time that most people aren’t,” MacNally said.

MacNally, 65, of Blaine, volunteered with a number of organizations even before his retirement in 2003, but dearest to his heart is his work with the National Multiple Sclerosis Society.

Last month, the society bestowed upon MacNally its highest honor: the National Volunteer of the Year Award.

MacNally accepted the award at the National MS Society’s National Leadership Conference in Fort Worth, Texas, Nov. 6.

His wife, Janet, and son, Andrew, were along to see MacNally recognized.

“I was very moved by it,” MacNally said. “I don’t do this work because I want to be honored or achieve some kind of recognition – I do it because I care about the people and the cause.”

MacNally has been highly involved with the National MS Society since shortly after his MS diagnosis at age 46 in 1996.

He sits on the MS Society’s Board of Trustees as the Government Relations Committee chairperson, leveraging his experience as a hospital administrator to really dive into policy.

Recently, MacNally recalls lobbying for Medicare expansion, implementation of the Affordable Care Act, legalization of marijuana, additional transportation options, improved access to neurologists and MS specialists and more.

He strives to work at all MS fundraising events and programs in Minnesota, including walks, bike rides and MuckFest.

“When it comes to volunteer engagement, Bill truly leads the way,” said Holly Anderson, president of the National MS Society Upper Midwest Chapter. “His passion and dedication is evident in everything he does. There is no doubt that Bill’s contagious enthusiasm has surely brought us closer to a world free of the disease.”

MS affects approximately 2.3 million people worldwide, 400,000 in the United States. The disease affects the central nervous system, disrupting communication between the body’s nerves and the brain.

Several forms of MS exist and vary in their severity. MacNally has relapsing-remitting MS, one of the more mild manifestations of the disease.

MacNally experiences numbness and tingling in his limbs. He has double vision and experiences foot drop, causing him to wear customized braces on both legs. He doesn’t tolerate heat well and fights fatigue daily.

No cure for MS exists, and when MacNally was diagnosed, there was nothing available to treat the disease.

In the late 1990s, the first drugs hit the market.

MacNally takes three shots weekly to manage his MS.

“We’ve made fantastic progress,” he said. “It’s terrible to have MS, but it’s a great time to have it.”

Researchers are hard at work developing drugs for individuals with more debilitating forms of the disease – secondary-progressive and primary-progressive.

MacNally will continue his work with the National MS Society.

“It means a great deal to me,” he said.
