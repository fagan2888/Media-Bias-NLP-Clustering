First, he asserted that, henceforth, the Court, not executive agencies, will get the decisive say in construing provisions of \u201cdeep economic and political significance ... central to ... statutory scheme[s].\u201d Surprised experts read this as a \u201cpower-grab,\u201d shelving a longstanding rule of deference to \u201creasonable\u201d agency interpretations of Congress\u2019s intent. Given the Court\u2019s 5-4 conservative majority, this self-empowerment might portend ominous consequences for progressive programs.\n\nYet the chief justice also laid down two additional, interrelated markers that, if followed, could mitigate such concerns\u2014in particular, anxiety that the Court will let stand the Fifth Circuit majority\u2019s dispatch of DAPA. Conspicuously, he accentuated a design to ward off perceptions that the Court is becoming politicized by signaling inhospitality to future \u201cimplausible\u201d cases fabricated to urge courts not to \u201crespect the role of the Legislature\u201d and \u201cundo what it has done.\u201d In addition, Roberts unsheathed what Yale law professor Abbe Gluck termed a \u201cgame-changing\u201d and generous approach to interpreting major laws\u2014i.e., to focus on Congress\u2019s overall \u201clegislative plan,\u201d rather than discrete textual words or phrases in isolation.\n\nAs I have written, Roberts\u2019s thinly veiled warnings against political attacks dressed up as legal claims follow from his concern, broached in a November 2014 speech, that \u201cpolarization\u201d in the political branches could \u201cspill over and affect\u201d the Court. Of course, that spillover perception has already reached epidemic levels. For the first time since the 1930s, the likely 2016 Democratic presidential nominee has made Supreme Court appointments a major issue, warning that \u201cconservatives are wholeheartedly relying on Republican-appointed judges to undo progressive achievements.\u201d Republican candidates vow litmus tests that would preclude any nominee who, like Roberts or Justice Anthony Kennedy, might in some cases decline to rubber-stamp the political agenda of the party\u2019s right-wing. Mainstream media accounts now frequently view even the lower federal courts through the lens of the party affiliation of individual judges\u2019 nominating presidents.\n\nIf Roberts stays focused on shielding the judiciary from such perceptions, the Court\u2019s response to the Fifth Circuit\u2019s DAPA decision should be straightforward. It will accept review and dismiss the case on the ground that the party that filed it, the state of Texas (on behalf of 25 similarly Republican-led states), has asserted no injury that gives it legal \u201cstanding\u201d to get its grievance into court. The alleged injury on which the lower court judges relied to allow Texas to challenge DAPA is that, under Texas law, recipients of deferred action status may obtain state-subsidized drivers\u2019 licenses, costing the state $130.89 each.\n\nTo be sure, state governments have standing to vindicate genuinely \u201csovereign\u201d interests in court, and appropriately so. But, as numerous experts have noted, well-established doctrine bars state or local entities from seeking judicial redress simply for incidental, self-engineered (Texas is free to repeal its subsidy) monetary loss from a federal policy change, certainly not on such a trivial scale. From the standpoint of defusing perceptions of politicization, retaining barriers to standing for Texas\u2019s DAPA challenge will have a more systematic\u2014and consequential\u2014impact than the rejection of last term\u2019s attempt to cripple the ACA. Ruling otherwise will license state or local politicians to put virtually any beef with the feds, however politically driven, on the docket of a convenient lower federal court, and, ultimately, the Supreme Court. Government programs at all levels could be threatened with gridlock\u2014just as national immigration enforcement policy is gridlocked by this lawsuit.\n\nAs Texas\u2019s own governor, Greg Abbott, recently the state\u2019s attorney general, said of his approach to his former job, \u201cI go into the office, I sue the federal government, and then I go home.\u201d Abbott\u2019s serene confidence in the efficacy of simply filing a complaint rested, no doubt, on the reputation of the Fifth Circuit, which covers cases originating in Texas, as the nation\u2019s most right-leaning appellate court. This was candidly acknowledged by Edward Blum, peripatetic architect of challenges to legal protections for racial minorities, who said, \u201cAdvocates [seeking] high-profile, conservative outcomes [have] incentive to go the Fifth Circuit.\u201d\n\nIn the pending case, Abbott\u2019s forum-shopping paid off big-time, producing favorable decisions by Fifth Circuit judges well-known for their hostility to immigration and to President Obama himself. In effect, they empowered Abbott to shut down national immigration policies not only in Texas, but nationwide, including multiple jurisdictions that have filed friend-of-the-court briefs strongly supporting DAPA and outlining its benefits for their economies.\n\nIf the Court relaxes current standing strictures and reaches the merits of Texas\u2019s claim, the administration\u2019s defense of DAPA\u2019s legality will also be reinforced by Roberts\u2019s King v. Burwell opinion\u2014specifically, his linchpin holding that \u201ca fair reading of legislation demands a fair understanding of the legislative plan.\u201d Implicitly, though pointedly, this focus on Congress\u2019s \u201cplan\u201d sidelined the hyper-literalist brand of \u201ctextualism\u201d long touted by Justice Antonin Scalia and conservative allies\u2014frequently used to justify narrowly reading individual words or phrases out of context (as they did in King v. Burwell itself).\n\nIn the case of the immigration laws, the crux of that legislative plan, pervasively manifest throughout federal immigration statutes, is to delegate broad discretion to the executive branch as to how to tailor enforcement priorities to funding resources, as limited by Congress, sufficient to remove only a fraction of the total number of undocumented immigrants (400,000 annually, out of a total of more than 11 million). As recently as 2009, a House of Representatives Committee Report specifically confirmed Congress\u2019s direction to the Department of Homeland Security not to \u201csimply round up as many illegal immigrants as possible,\u201d but to ensure \u201cthat the government\u2019s huge investments in immigration enforcement are producing the maximum return in actually making our country safer.\u201d\n\nThe DAPA directive simply sets out guidelines for conferring \u201cdeferred action\u201d treatment in accord with enforcement priorities perfectly matching that instruction. Authorization for such deferred action recipients to work and receive work-related benefits arises, not from DAPA, but from longstanding regulations (promulgated by the Reagan Administration) and statutory provisions\u2014a fact recognized two decades ago by the Supreme Court, and flatly ignored by the lower court judges who have made this work-authorization consequence the nub of their argument for halting DAPA in its tracks.\n\nThree and a half years ago, the Court outlined\u2014and endorsed\u2014the conceptual framework undergirding the administration\u2019s interpretation of its immigration enforcement authority. A 5-3 decision in 2012, in an opinion written by Justice Kennedy and joined by Chief Justice Roberts, emphasized that \u201cbroad discretion\u201d for \u201cimmigration officials [is] a principal feature of the removal system, [including] whether it makes sense to pursue removal at all,\u201d based on, among multiple factors, \u201cimmediate human concerns\u201d and \u201cforeign policy.\u201d If the Court takes, as its lodestar for evaluating DAPA, the plan manifest over decades of legislating and administering the immigration laws, it is unlikely that votes will be found to invalidate it\u2014in the (also unlikely) event that a majority will grant standing and reach the merits of Texas\u2019 case.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "description": "The court's past rulings on Obamacare could prove decisive in a case that is up for consideration this week.", "og": {"site_name": "New Republic", "description": "The court's past rulings on Obamacare could prove decisive in a case that is up for consideration this week.", "title": "Next up at the Supreme Court: Obama\u2019s Immigration Policy", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/f8100d1e4da3e1c4f2aff742b2473942a8972758.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "url": "https://newrepublic.com/article/127504/next-supreme-court-obamas-immigration-policy", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/f8100d1e4da3e1c4f2aff742b2473942a8972758.jpeg?w=1024&h=512&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "description": "The court's past rulings on Obamacare could prove decisive in a case that is up for consideration this week.", "site": "@newrepublic", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Next up at the Supreme Court: Obama\u2019s Immigration Policy"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "parsely-metadata": "{\"thumb_image\":\"http://images.newrepublic.com/f8100d1e4da3e1c4f2aff742b2473942a8972758.jpeg\"}", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Next up at the Supreme Court: Obama\u2019s Immigration Policy\",\"link\":\"https://newrepublic.com/article/127504/next-supreme-court-obamas-immigration-policy\",\"section\":\"Politics\",\"pub_date\":\"2016-01-13T13:00:00.000Z\",\"post_id\":127504,\"author\":\"Simon Lazarus\",\"type\":\"post\",\"tags\":[\"Politics\",\"Supreme Court\",\"Immigration\",\"Barack Obama\",\"John Roberts\",\"Anthony Kennedy\",\"Greg Abbott\",\"-type_article\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 4404589, "pages": 161419311535, "app_id": 1675346479369918}, "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thenewrepublic", "tag": "Politics", "published_time": "2016-01-13"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Three and a half years ago, the Court outlined\u2014and endorsed\u2014the conceptual framework undergirding the administration\u2019s interpretation of its immigration enforcement authority.\nGovernment programs at all levels could be threatened with gridlock\u2014just as national immigration enforcement policy is gridlocked by this lawsuit.\nTo be sure, state governments have standing to vindicate genuinely \u201csovereign\u201d interests in court, and appropriately so.\nRuling otherwise will license state or local politicians to put virtually any beef with the feds, however politically driven, on the docket of a convenient lower federal court, and, ultimately, the Supreme Court.\nIf Roberts stays focused on shielding the judiciary from such perceptions, the Court\u2019s response to the Fifth Circuit\u2019s DAPA decision should be straightforward."}
