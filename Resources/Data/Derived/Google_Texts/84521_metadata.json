(WTHI) \u2013 A Democrat state lawmaker says a movement by his party to raise Indiana\u2019s minimum wage is dead for this session.\n\nWhile Hoosiers probably won\u2019t be getting a pay raise this year, the debate continues.\n\nMany question, could it do more harm than good?\n\nNews 10 spoke with local representatives who weigh out the pros and cons.\n\n\u201cI will issue an executive order requiring federal contractors to pay their federally funded employees a fair wage of at least $10.10 an hour.\u201d\n\nThose are the words of President Obama, during his State of the Union Address, that ignited a nationwide debate, and now many Indiana legislators are making the same plea for all workers.\n\nAn amendment to raise the state\u2019s minimum wage by $1 was recently voted down.\n\n\u201cRight now its $7.25 and we would like to raise it to $8.25 that came up as an amendment on a bill in the House. It didn\u2019t go. It didn\u2019t get enough support from the other side,\u201d says Representative Clyde Kersey, District 43.\n\nKersey believes the raise would be a big step towards helping Hoosier families who are struggling under the current wage.\n\n\u201cIf we can elevate those people so they have more money to spend that it will create additional spending, and create more demand for products, and help our economy,\u201d says Kersey.\n\nThose who oppose the hike fear just the opposite would happen, resulting in higher price tags and even job loss.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a trade off and an off set. I certainly think that people deserve to make more money, but I think we need to take a look at the impact too. I think there are a lot of people who might be out of work as a result of increasing it,\u201d says Representative Timothy Skinner, District 38.\n\nKersey agrees businesses would have to make changes, but he doesn\u2019t see the impact as a negative one.\n\n\u201cIf they have to raise the minimum wage they will probably raise their prices. Some people don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea. I think it is, because in the end every dollar that we spend creates additional dollars in buying power,\u201d says Kersey.\n\nFor now the question remains, what is the solution to remedy the growing number of people living below the poverty line?\n\nSkinner says he\u2019s still on the fence as to whether or not raising minimum wage is the answer.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the biggest issues that should be out there and that we should be dealing with that were not dealing with because the answers are just so darn tough,\u201d says Skinner.\n\nKersey added the issue will be brought up again next year.\n\nHe says the attention minimum wage is receiving from the federal level this year may affect the issue in 2015.\n\n\u201cStates generally tend to follow what the federal government does, and now since the federal government is now pushing to raise the minimum wage, I think there will be more support for it next year than this year,\u201d Kersey said.\n\nLast month, the President signed an executive order raising the minimum wage for federally contracted employees to $10.10.", "article_metadata": {"Description": "Leading the Way in Terre Haute and the Wabash Valley with the most accurate and reliable news, weather, and sports coverage, along with the latest breaking news and severe weather coverage.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=488538858", "og": {"site_name": "WTHITV.com", "description": "TERRE HAUTE, Ind.
