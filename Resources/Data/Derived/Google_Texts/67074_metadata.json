Vista Pointe homes range from $329,00 to $865,000, according to the listings.\n\nThe issue is \u201d a microcosm of a heated debate that is engrossing all of Colorado and its residents,\u201d Vista Ridge resident Parker McMannes said in an e-mail.\n\nAt the planning board\u2019s July meeting, Vista Ridge residents said the board must decide whether Erie is a suburban area or an industrial area, according to press reports.\n\nEncana has been developing the site under a memorandum of understanding it signed with the town in 2012.\n\nThe binding agreement requires higher operating standards than state rules in drilling, hydrofracturing or fracking, and in ongoing operations.\n\nStill, some residents in the developments say they were surprised .\n\n\u201cWe made an honest attempt at outreach,\u201d said Encana\u2019s Wiedenbeck.\n\nThe proposed wells are aligned with existing wells at the site \u2014 as recommended by state rules, Wiedenbeck said.\n\nThe closest wells to residences are about 770 feet from a Vista Ridge property line and 1,000 feet from a Vista Pointe property line, according to Encana. The state\u2019s minimum setback is 500 feet.\n\nLast week, the oil and gas company held one meeting at Vista Ridge and one at Vista Pointe.\n\n\u201cSome people listened and had questions,\u201d Wiedenbeck said. \u201cSome just wanted to know what it would take for us to go away.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd585\"", "article_summary": "Last week, the oil and gas company held one meeting at Vista Ridge and one at Vista Pointe.\nUnder the plan, Encana would sink 13 wells from two drilling pads on private land between the Vista Pointe and Vista Ridge developments.\nVista Ridge, which bills itself as being \u201clike a five-star resort,\u201d has homes for sale on listing services in the $400,000 to $500,000 range.\nThe issue is \u201d a microcosm of a heated debate that is engrossing all of Colorado and its residents,\u201d Vista Ridge resident Parker McMannes said in an e-mail.\nVista Pointe homes range from $329,00 to $865,000, according to the listings."}
