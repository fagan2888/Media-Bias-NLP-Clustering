Chris Coons, D-Del., as he was getting out of his car. \u201cAs the co-founder of the Human Rights Caucus in the Senate, I do think we need to pay attention to human rights all over the world, regardless of where human rights violations arise,\u201d he said.\n\nI asked if he would comment specifically on Saudi Arabia. Coons ignored me and continued walking into the building, even though a staff member accompanying him had just informed the senator that he had \u201cplenty of time\u201d before his speech. The staff member offered to exchange contact information for a lengthier comment later. I emailed and did not hear back.\n\nSen. Mark Warner, D-Va., stopped briefly to chat. \u201cObviously I\u2019m concerned in particular with some of the indiscriminate bombing in Yemen and, as we think about the increasing responsibilities that all of the Gulf states have in the challenge against ISIL, it shows that one, they need to step up and they need to step up with more focus than the kind of indiscriminate bombing, frankly.\u201d\n\nI asked Warner if that meant there needed to be a pause in the bombing in Yemen. \u201cThat\u2019s the comment I\u2019ve made,\u201d Warner replied, turning to leave the building.\n\nSen. John McCain, R-Ariz., spent the most time discussing the issue with me. But his answers were perplexing.\n\n\u201cThey may be bombing civilians, which is actually not true,\u201d McCain said, when asked about civilian casualties in Yemen.\n\n\u201cCivilians aren\u2019t dying?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cNo, they\u2019re not,\u201d the senator replied. \u201cOh, I\u2019m sure civilians die in war. Not nearly as many as the Houthis have executed,\u201d McCain continued, referring to the Shiite militia waging an insurgency against the Sunni government in Yemen.\n\nAsked about the recent reports of Saudi forces bombing a wedding party in Yemen, McCain said, \u201cI\u2019m sure in wars terrible things happen and the Houthis however are an extremist group backed by the Iranians who are slaughtering Yemenis.\u201d\n\nThe U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights has reported that more than 2,300 civilians have been killed in the Yemen conflict, and that both Houthi rebels and the Saudi-led forces share responsibility for the deaths. The UNHCHR spokesperson has told reporters, however, that the Saudi-led bombing campaign has caused most of the deaths.\n\nI tried to ask McCain, who serves as chairman of the International Republican Institute, a U.S. government-backed human rights and democracy promotion nonprofit, if he had an opinion on the spate of executions in Saudi Arabia, which have averaged at a rate of one execution every two days.\n\n\u201cOf course I have always stood for human rights and will continue to keep standing for human rights,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u201cObviously I\u2019m concerned in particular with some of the indiscriminate bombing in Yemen and, as we think about the increasing responsibilities that all of the Gulf states have in the challenge against ISIL, it shows that one, they need to step up and they need to step up with more focus than the kind of indiscriminate bombing, frankly.\u201d, Human Rights, Saudi Arabia, U.S., Yemen,", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "The Intercept", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "\u201cObviously I\u2019m concerned in particular with some of the indiscriminate bombing in Yemen and, as we think about the increasing responsibilities that all of the Gulf states have in the challenge against ISIL, it shows that one, they need to step up and they need to step up with more focus than the kind of indiscriminate bombing, frankly.\u201d, Human Rights, Saudi Arabia, U.S., Yemen,", "title": "U.S. Senators Hem And Haw On Saudi Arabia\u2019s Human Rights Abuses", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/u-s-senators-hem-and-haw-on-saudi-arabias-human-rights-abuses/210063/", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/March30thstrikeinAden-1000x500.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-10-02T19:58:47-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\u201cObviously I\u2019m concerned in particular with some of the indiscriminate bombing in Yemen and, as we think about the increasing responsibilities that all of the Gulf states have in the challenge against ISIL, it shows that one, they need to step up and they need to step up with more focus than the kind of indiscriminate bombing, frankly.\u201d, Human Rights, Saudi Arabia, U.S., Yemen,", "creator": "@MintPressNews", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/March30thstrikeinAden-1000x500.jpg", "title": "U.S. Senators Hem And Haw On Saudi Arabia\u2019s Human Rights Abuses", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Daily Digest", "tag": "Yemen", "published_time": "2015-10-03T05:00:18-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-02T19:58:47-05:00"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdff56\"", "article_summary": "\u201cOf course I have always stood for human rights and will continue to keep standing for human rights,\u201d he said.\n\u201cAs the co-founder of the Human Rights Caucus in the Senate, I do think we need to pay attention to human rights all over the world, regardless of where human rights violations arise,\u201d he said.\nThe UNHCHR spokesperson has told reporters, however, that the Saudi-led bombing campaign has caused most of the deaths.\n\u201cThey may be bombing civilians, which is actually not true,\u201d McCain said, when asked about civilian casualties in Yemen.\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsorFormer Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney smiled and repeatedly said, \u201cNice to see you,\u201d when I asked if he had any concerns about the Saudi-led bombing campaign in Yemen."}
