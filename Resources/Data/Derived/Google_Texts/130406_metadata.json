One function sends users offers for businesses nearby when location services are enabled, and there is also a fan wall where users can post photos and write about their experiences.\n\nThe app is an extension of the Foothills Adventure Map, a tourism brochure of businesses and activities in the area. Trilk said the chamber is working on its third edition of the map for next year and is applying for a tourism grant to help get it into more tourist destinations across the Front Range. The app will help with that, Trilk said, as well as get more businesses and community members involved in promotion of the area.\n\n\u201cAnd really promote our area as a place to g,o because we are only 20 minutes from Denver and we have so much to do,\u201d she added.\n\nThe Conifer Recreation Coalition, while separate from the chamber and its mobile app, has been reaching out to the community since November for input for a master plan its calling Project PLACE to help direct fundraising and grant applications for the area.\n\nThe Conifer Area Council also recently launched a survey to get community input for Jefferson County\u2019s Conifer community plan, which is being rewritten this year.\n\nThey are all efforts to build cohesion, direction and branding among the area\u2019s community and businesses.\n\nTrilk said the Conifer Area Council is doing its best to get community members more involved, and the chamber\u2019s app is one way of doing that.\n\nShe added: \u201cWe really think that the more people get active and involved, the more they feel like they have a voice, and the better our whole community develops.\u201d\n\nJosie Klemaier: 303-954-2465, jklemaier@denverpost.com\n\n285 tourism app:\n\nOn Apple iTunes\n\nGoogle Play for Android\n\nMobile Website", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Conifer group launches mobile app 285 Tourism to collect area info", "title": "Conifer group launches mobile app 285 Tourism to collect area info", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/07/16/conifer-group-launches-mobile-app-285-tourism-to-collect-area-info/", "image": {"width": 436, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140716__285_appp1.jpg", "height": 654}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140716__285_appp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-16T15:23:47+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T05:44:52+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The Conifer Area Council also recently launched a survey to get community input for Jefferson County\u2019s Conifer community plan, which is being rewritten this year.\nThe 285 Tourism app was developed by Indiana-based developer My Mobile Fans and lists businesses, events, emergency information and maps of both Jefferson and Park counties.\nA new mobile application launched by the Conifer Area and Platte Canyon chambers of commerce for the areas surrounding the U.S. 285 corridor features maps, event listings, emergency sites and more.\nThe app is an extension of the Foothills Adventure Map, a tourism brochure of businesses and activities in the area.\nTrilk said the Conifer Area Council is doing its best to get community members more involved, and the chamber\u2019s app is one way of doing that."}
