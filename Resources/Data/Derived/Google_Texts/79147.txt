It has been a strange week for mixing gay right, media, and politics. Texas Governor Rick Perry surprised a San Francisco audience when he said, "I may have the genetic coding that I'm inclined to be an alcoholic, but I have the desire not to do that, and I look at homosexual issues the same way." Anderson Cooper had an edgy conversation with a Texas -- what is it about Texas? -- state rep who supports the so-called "conversion therapy."

But it was the seven-minute duel between NPR's Terry Gross and Hillary Clinton about the latter's long, slow evolution on gay marriage that really grabbed our attention. We say more about that this hour, along with a plan being hatched, right under our noses, to stage Wagner's Ring Cycle here in Connecticut with a digital orchestra has ignited a national, and maybe international outcry.
