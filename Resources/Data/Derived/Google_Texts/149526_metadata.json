To succeed, Chu and her allies in the entertainment industry need to win the public back.\n\nThe aggressive opposition of Wikipedia and Google, two major proponents of a free and open Internet, helped sink the bill Chu co-sponsored. They propagated the idea that SOPA would end the Internet as we know it.\n\n\u201cThe American public doesn\u2019t understand the consequences to piracy,\u201d Chu told TheWrap. \u201cThere are large segments of it that even think it\u2019s okay.\u201d\n\nAlso read: Ron Burgundy Advises Audiences Against Film Piracy in New \u2018Anchorman 2\u2019 Spot (Video)\n\nChu, who represents a swath of northeastern Los Angeles that includes Pasadena, Monterey Park and much of the San Gabriel Valley, stopped by the American Film Market over the weekend to talk with members of the film industry about the enduring problem.\n\nShe believes piracy poses a grave threat to the financiers and sales agents in attendance, and they are eager to have an ally in Washington D.C.\n\nTheWrap spoke with Chu about what she learned from SOPA, whether Google has done enough to stop piracy and how to bring production back to the United States.\n\nTheWrap: What brought you to AFM?\n\nJean Prewitt invited me. She helped me with the Creative Rights Caucus, which is something I started after the defeat of SOPA. There needed to be a way to tell the stories of filmmakers and musicians and songwriters who make a living by creating these works of art.\n\nWhat did you learn from the failure of SOPA?\n\nThe American public doesn\u2019t understand the consequences to piracy. There are large segments of it that even think it\u2019s okay. They thought SOPA would shut down the Internet. There has to be a better way of doing outreach to the American public.\n\nAlso read: MPAA: Google Gets a Failing Grade for Anti-Piracy Efforts (Updated)\n\nWhat do you want them to know?\n\nThey may have the misperception that they are just affecting big studios. They are not thinking about the every day person, the people who live in my district \u2013 set designers, lighting technicians. There are hundreds of thousands of people being affected. People need to see their face and their story.\n\nWhat stories did you hear from executives at AFM?\n\nThey told me about their problems with piracy and how it\u2019s affected what they do. It\u2019s created greater difficulties in terms of pre-selling movies. It affects them every day.\n\nHow so?\n\nThe most drastic is in pre-selling. It has made the market much less lucrative. They can\u2019t get financing. It\u2019s different from the major motion picture studios. They finance movies through pre-sales, and with the drop in the DVD market they can\u2019t make what they did before.\n\nBut pre-selling is about foreign territories. Is piracy a larger issues overseas than in the United States?\n\nIt\u2019s just as big an issue here. There are some countries that have absolutely no enforcement where it\u2019s particularly bad. Spain is a country where piracy is rampant. But we still have the same problem here \u2013 no enforcement.\n\nAlso read: \u2018Breaking Bad\u2019 Creator Vince Gilligan: Piracy Helped My Meth Series\n\nHow do you remedy that?\n\nWe need to have a greater understanding of [piracy] by the American public. Piracy affects one of the main American exports. It\u2019s a huge industry for the United States, and Americans have to understand it is not right to pirate information.\n\nThe MPAA just did a study on how people get pirated content. 74 percent said they first were introduced to infringing content through search engines.\n\nHow often do you talk to Google about this? They are obviously the biggest player out there.\n\nWe want to have roundtable with them. Google did talk to us about their own voluntary program to make pirated sites appear lower in search.\n\nThe MPAA has found it hasn\u2019t had much effect thus far.\n\nWhy wasn\u2019t it successful?\n\nJust look at the results. Pirated sites still come up on the first page in search.\n\nWould you introduce another bill?\n\nWe need to go as far as we can with voluntary effort and cooperation before we put out another bill.\n\nWe are not so far apart. With Google\u2019s voluntary effort, at least they recognize there\u2019s a problem. The question is whether it\u2019s effective. If we can make the program more effective, that would be a great step forward. We need to develop a better system for fighting piracy than a whack-a- mole project.\n\nWhat other topics came up in conversation with the folks at AFM? Was it only piracy?\n\nPiracy is the dominant issue, but we also talked about film tax credits. The federal film tax credit expires at the end of December. This is another issue I am concerned about. \u201cIron Man 3\u201d already filmed abroad. There is no excuse for that.\n\nAre you only pushing for credits at the federal level, or the state level too?\n\nBoth, but we need to make sure the federal tax credit continues so we have as much incentive as possible for films to stay in the U.S.\n\nWould you want to increase the subsidies?\n\nI would like to do that, but at this point it would be a major accomplishment just to get it extended. It should be permanent so it doesn\u2019t have to be renewed every so often.\n\nWhy is it such a struggle?\n\nHave you heard of our government shutdown?\n\nIt\u2019s been unavoidable.\n\nThere are some people in our Congress who want to shut down nearly every aspect of government. It\u2019s hard to get any budget agreement going on \u2013 particularly with tax credits.\n\nDoes it come up a lot in budget negotiations?\n\nLet\u2019s just say we want to be a little subtle about it so it doesn\u2019t come up as a point of controversy.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/JudyChu-150x150.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Lucas Shaw", "description": "Chu spoke with TheWrap about what she learned from SOPA and why we need a permanent federal tax credit.", "generator": "WooFramework 6.2.0", "og": {"site_name": "TheWrap", "description": "Chu spoke with TheWrap about what she learned from SOPA and why we need a permanent federal tax credit.", "title": "Congresswoman Judy Chu: Too Many Americans Think Piracy is OK", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 618, "identifier": "http://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/JudyChu.jpg", "height": 434}, "updated_time": "2014-07-10T20:17:10+00:00", "url": "http://www.thewrap.com/congresswoman-judy-chu-many-americans-think-piracy-okay/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Chu spoke with TheWrap about what she learned from SOPA and why we need a permanent federal tax credit.", "creator": "@lucas_shaw", "url": "http://www.thewrap.com/congresswoman-judy-chu-many-americans-think-piracy-okay/", "image": {"src": "http://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/JudyChu-340x300.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/JudyChu-340x300.jpg"}, "title": "Congresswoman Judy Chu: Too Many Americans Think Piracy is OK", "site": "@thewrap", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-11-10T00:32:00+00:00", "sailthru.title": "Congresswoman Judy Chu: Too Many Americans Think Piracy is OK", "wp-parsely_version": "1.6", "fb": {"app_id": 228236404181023}, "google-site-verification": "-PpFSIrGHybVDxbndrL6MCngw3j6BXdy0xDVBVVOacI", "article": {"publisher": "http://facebook.com/thewrap", "section": "Media", "published_time": "2013-11-09T16:32:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-10T20:17:10+00:00"}, "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Congresswoman Judy Chu: Too Many Americans Think Piracy is OK\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/www.thewrap.com\\/congresswoman-judy-chu-many-americans-think-piracy-okay\\/\",\"image_url\":\"http:\\/\\/www.thewrap.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2013\\/11\\/JudyChu-150x150.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"179238\",\"pub_date\":\"2013-11-10T00:32:00Z\",\"section\":\"Media\",\"author\":\"Lucas Shaw\",\"tags\":[]}", "sailthru.category": "media,movies", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/JudyChu.jpg", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=6.0, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe American public doesn\u2019t understand the consequences to piracy,\u201d Chu told TheWrap.\nSince the defeat of the Stop Online Piracy Act, better known as SOPA, congresswoman Judy Chu has intensified her efforts to eradicate piracy.\nThe American public doesn\u2019t understand the consequences to piracy.\nThe federal film tax credit expires at the end of December.\nThere has to be a better way of doing outreach to the American public."}
