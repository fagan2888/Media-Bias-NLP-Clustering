Getting out of federally funded testing programs and grassroots opposition were described as two important ways to roll back Common Core.\n\nDespite Common Core\u2019s unpopularity, conservatives are struggling to get the educational standards repealed. Many states had to adopt the standards in order to receive a waiver from now-impossible provisions of the old No Child Left Behind law from President Obama\u2019s Department of Education.\n\nMost states altered their education systems to accommodate Common Core before public opinion turned against the standards. Many states joined one of the two federally-funded testing consortia, the Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers and the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium. But dropouts have now left only 29 states as full members of either consortium.\n\n\u201cIf you can get out of the tests, and your state can run your own tests, then for all intents and purposes you can begin to reclaim control of your state\u2019s education system,\u201d Neal McCluskey, an educational scholar at the libertarian Cato Institute, said on the panel.\n\nStay abreast of the latest developments from nation's capital and beyond with curated News Alerts from the Washington Examiner news desk and delivered to your inbox.

Obama\u2019s method of persuading states to join Common Core was even more effective as education funding was scarce during the recession. McCluskey compared this method of persuasion to mugging.\n\n\u201cPeople say \u2018states voluntarily adopted the Common Core.\u2019 And you can only say \u2018voluntary\u2019 if you\u2019re also willing to say if somebody mugged you and said \u2018Well if you\u2019d like your money back all you have to do is give me your car.\u2019 And if you voluntarily give them your car, then you can say it\u2019s voluntary.\u201d\n\nThe other panelist was Emmett McGroarty, who leads on education policy at the American Principles Project. \u201cThis is a movement led by grassroots activists ... and they\u2019re going to war against anything that interferes with their right to have a say in what their children learn,\u201d McGroarty said. \u201cThat includes Republicans in Congress, that includes Democrats in Congress, that includes the current attempt to try to re-authorize No Child Left Behind.\u201d\n\nMcGroarty was staunchly opposed to Common Core, saying it \u201cblocks children into an inferior, low-quality education.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Common Core came under attack on Thursday at the Conservative Political Action Conference, as a panel of two education experts outlined their issues with the educational standards.
