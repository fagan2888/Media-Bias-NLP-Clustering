Many are crucial to the success of the health care law.\n\nThe IRS is responsible for enforcing the individual mandate, which requires everyone to have health coverage or pay a penalty. It\u2019s also in charge of the premium tax credit, which is given to people who get federal subsidies under the health care law. These, along with the employer mandate, will be a trial run for the IRS. Will it be prepared to play such a huge role in the implementation of Obamacare?\n\nRelated: Get Ready for the Most Miserable Tax Filing Season Ever\n\nThe agency\u2019s new responsibilities come just as Congress slashed its budget by $346 million this year. The IRS\u2019s budget\u2014which is no stranger to cuts\u2014is now at about $10.9 billion--$1 billion less than it was five years ago.\n\nIRS officials have constantly warned lawmakers that cutting the agency\u2019s budget will result in a hellish filing season for taxpayers. IRS Taxpayer Advocate Nina Olson estimated that the cuts and staffing reductions mean IRS agents will only be able to answer 43 percent of the calls the agency receives from taxpayers this year, she said in her annual report.\n\nIRS Commissioner John Koskinen also warned that the agency will likely face furloughs this year because of the cuts. But on top of its usual responsibilities, the agency will now have to be prepared for its new role policing Obamacare penalties and subsidies.\n\nThe White House, meanwhile, is asking Congress, to beef up the IRS\u2019s budget. In the president\u2019s $4 trillion budget proposal for 2016, he requests $13.9 billion for the IRS---roughly $3 billion more than this year\u2014in order to help the agency take on its new responsibilities.\n\nRelated: Why the Cash-Strapped IRS Isn\u2019t Ready for Obamacare\n\nSo, what changes for taxpayers this year? When filing taxes this year, taxpayers will be required to check a box identifying whether or not they have health coverage to comply with the health law\u2019s individual mandate. Those filing for exemptions will have to fill out a separate form. There are at least 33 exemptions that people can claim and file for and the IRS will need to verify every single one.\n\nThen there are the penalties. People who did not have coverage and do not apply for exemptions will need to pay the penalty\u2014which is 1 percent of their annual income or $95\u2014whichever is greater. To pay the penalty, people will need to fill out a form, which identifies when they were without coverage. The penalty will either be added to a person\u2019s tax bill, or deducted from their refund.\n\nDon\u2019t forget about the subsidies. People receiving insurance subsidies for health coverage will also need to fill out new forms and answer questions about their current income, since the amount of subsidies they received this year was determined based off of their 2013 tax return\u2014meaning their income could be different. If they made less than before, they may receive a larger subsidy included in this year\u2019s tax return, but if their income has increased since they applied and qualified for subsidies, they might end up owing the government money\u2014the IRS is in charge of processing all of that.\n\nIndeed, there is plenty for the IRS to do, not to mention it\u2019s normal enforcement and collections responsibilities. So it\u2019s not hard to understand why the agency is begging Congress to increase its budget. At the same time, the GOP-controlled Congress is hesitant to give the agency more money, especially after the agency targeted conservative groups last summer and spent millions on lavish conferences.\n\nStill, Koskinen, who was not at the agency during that time, has vowed to get back in Congress\u2019s good graces\u2026though it doesn\u2019t appear to be happening anytime soon.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The White House is gearing up for what\u2019s likely to be the most headache-inducing tax s", "title": "Underfunded IRS Begins Crucial Obamacare Test", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/06/Underfunded-IRS-Begins-Crucial-Obamacare-Test", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/07312013_Medical_Costs_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/06/Underfunded-IRS-Begins-Crucial-Obamacare-Test", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/07312013_Medical_Costs_article.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The White House is gearing up for what\u2019s likely to be the most headache-inducing tax s", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "The IRS is responsible for enforcing the individual mandate, which requires everyone to have health coverage or pay a penalty.\nIRS officials have constantly warned lawmakers that cutting the agency\u2019s budget will result in a hellish filing season for taxpayers.\nThere are at least 33 exemptions that people can claim and file for and the IRS will need to verify every single one.\nIRS Commissioner John Koskinen also warned that the agency will likely face furloughs this year because of the cuts.\nIt\u2019s also in charge of the premium tax credit, which is given to people who get federal subsidies under the health care law."}
