What we\u2019re focusing on are really the wellness and \u2026 preventive health services.\u201d\n\nProviders will also be able to offer immunizations for children, smoking cessation counseling, colorectal cancer screenings and postpartum care.\n\nThe truck cost about $300,000 to retrofit and the program will cost about $500,000 annually to operate. But Gray said Highmark officials are hopeful that it will pay for itself by reducing the need for emergency room visits and serious medical interventions.\n\n\u201cIt is definitely a new trend to see that insurers are doing this,\u201d said Elizabeth Wallace, executive director of the Mobile Health Clinics Association. \u201cKaiser Permanente does have several vehicles in California as well as a few other states, and now United Healthcare has done it in Las Vegas, but it\u2019s definitely a new model. The majority of our members are nonprofit hospitals, federal qualified health centers and clinics.\u201d\n\nWallace estimated there are about 2,000 mobile health clinics nationwide, which run the gamut from HIV or blood pressure testing units to full doctor\u2019s offices on wheels, like Highmark\u2019s.\n\nGray said mobile clinic appointments will begin in June in West Virginia.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health", "description": "Health insurer Highmark is launching a new mobile health clinic in an attempt to bring care to those who find it difficult to get to the doctor\u2019s office.", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://wesa.fm/post/trip-doctor-takes-new-meaning-mobile-health-clinic", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wesa/files/styles/medium/public/201605/mobile_clinic.JPG", "type": "article", "description": "Health insurer Highmark is launching a new mobile health clinic in an attempt to bring care to those who find it difficult to get to the doctor\u2019s office.", "title": "A Trip To The Doctor Takes New Meaning With Mobile Health Clinic"}, "story_id": 477604358, "twitter": {"site": "@905wesa", "card": "summary", "creator": "@WESALiz"}, "author": "Liz Reid", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "A Trip To The Doctor Takes New Meaning With Mobile Health Clinic"}, "nid": 65222, "datePublished": "2016-05-11", "keywords": "Highmark, mobile health clinic, health care", "wordCount": 425, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Health insurer Highmark is launching a new mobile health clinic in an attempt to bring care to those who find it difficult to get to the doctor\u2019s office.\nHighmark will contact those members individually to set up appointments at a central location where the mobile health clinic will be stationed.\n\u201cIt is definitely a new trend to see that insurers are doing this,\u201d said Elizabeth Wallace, executive director of the Mobile Health Clinics Association.\nGray said mobile clinic appointments will begin in June in West Virginia.\nDubbed Healthcare on the Go, the RV-like facility will travel throughout Pennsylvania and West Virginia and will be staffed by local physicians and nurses in rural and other hard-to-reach communities."}
