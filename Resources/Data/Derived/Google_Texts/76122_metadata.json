Republicans have had a lock on Kansas\u2019 two Senate seats since 1939. After the Democratic nominee, Chad Taylor, said he would step aside, national Republicans moved to take control of the Roberts campaign, sending in a longtime troubleshooter to bolster it.\n\n\u201cI understand some partisan Democrats will falsely claim that I am acting out of party loyalty,\u201d Mr. Kobach said in a telephone interview Thursday evening, \u201cbut the law is clear.\u201d\n\nMr. Taylor, who had been trailing, sent a letter on Sept. 3 to Mr. Kobach, saying that he was withdrawing. Several prominent Democrats are said to have been instrumental in nudging him to do so to clear the way for the independent, Greg Orman, who has been leading Mr. Roberts in some recent polls. Mr. Kobach, who is a member of Mr. Roberts\u2019s honorary campaign committee, said that Mr. Taylor had failed to meet the requirements for removing his name from the ballot. Kansas law says candidates can be removed from the ballot if they die or declare that they are unable to complete the duties of office.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Taylor petitioned the state Supreme Court, and in an opinion Thursday afternoon, the court, which is dominated by Democratic appointees, ruled unanimously that Mr. Kobach had erred in refusing to accept Mr. Taylor\u2019s letter and ordered that his name be removed before ballots are mailed to overseas military personnel, a process that was scheduled to begin Saturday.\n\nMr. Kobach said Thursday that he would require the Democrats to select a replacement, a step he insisted was required by law. Mr. Kobach said he would extend the deadline to mail those ballots so the Democrats could pick someone else. If the party refuses to do so by noon next Friday, Mr. Kobach said he would \u201creview our legal options.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for the Kansas Democratic Party, did not respond Thursday to questions about whether his party would name a new candidate. But in a statement, the state Democratic Party chairwoman, Joan Wagnon, praised the ruling and said \u201cdemocracy is threatened\u201d with Mr. Kobach as secretary of state.\n\nMr. Orman, a 45-year-old former energy entrepreneur, has notably refused to commit to caucusing with the Democrats if he wins.\n\nHis campaign manager, Jim Jonas, said Thursday, \u201cNo matter who\u2019s on or off the ballot, Greg Orman is running as an independent against the broken system in Washington that has failed Kansas and failed America.\u201d\n\nThe court\u2019s decision prompted loud criticism from Kansas conservatives and enthusiastic praise from Democrats, including Mr. Kobach\u2019s opponent in his re-election campaign, who issued a statement calling his effort to block the withdrawal a \u201ccircus.\u201d\n\n\u201cKris Kobach attempted to control this situation single-handedly so that it would work for his personal agenda,\u201d said Jean Schodorf, the Democratic candidate for secretary of state. \u201cHe unilaterally bypassed the standard practice of allowing the challenge of a contested election issue to be reviewed by the several members of the State Elections Board so that he alone could rule on what is legal and what is not.\u201d\n\nMr. Roberts\u2019s campaign manager, Corry Bliss, issued a statement saying the court\u2019s decision \u201cdisenfranchised\u201d voters in the Democratic primary.\n\n\u201cThis is not only a travesty to Kansas voters, but it\u2019s a travesty to the judicial system and our electoral process,\u201d Mr. Bliss said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe race is one of at least three that Republican incumbents could lose this year in Kansas, where conservatives often win by wide margins. The governor, Sam Brownback, is considered vulnerable after many criticized his tax-cutting regimen. Mr. Kobach himself, who has become a national figure in efforts to require voter identification and to identify unauthorized immigrants, is in a close race with Ms. Schodorf.", "article_metadata":
