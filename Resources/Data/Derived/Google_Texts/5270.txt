The nation’s largest lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) civil rights group has announced it will honor singer-actress Jennifer Lopez with the 2013 Ally for Equality Award next month for her “commitment to better the lives of LGBT people.”

“Jennifer Lopez embodies the spirit of an ally to the LGBT community and we are thrilled to present her the Ally for Equality at our National Dinner in October,” Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin said in a statement.

The award is meant for “allies” outside the LGBT community who stand up on behalf of equality for all Americans, a press release stated.

“For years, Jennifer Lopez has been vocal about her love for the LGBT community, from her outspoken support for marriage equality, to the millions of dollars she’s raised for HIV/AIDS research and her efforts on behalf of bullying and youth anti-violence causes,” the press release reads.

Miss Lopez currently produces the ABC Family channel’s hit TV series “The Fosters,” about a multiethnic family mix of foster and biological children being raised by two moms.

“Throughout her career, Jennifer Lopez has always stood for fairness, justice and equality, and that’s what being an ally is all about,” Mr. Griffin added.

This year’s HRC dinner is a sold-out event for about 3,400 guests on Oct. 5 at the Washington Convention Center.

Several plaintiffs and attorneys from the Proposition 8 and Defense of Marriage Act cases earlier this year will be attendance, and singer Sara Bareilles will perform her hit song “Brave.”
