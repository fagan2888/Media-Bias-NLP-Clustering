Tom Heinsohn is being inducted as a coach after already being enshrined as a player, and will be joined by former coaches George Raveling and Australia\u2019s Lindsay Gaze, as well as ABA star Louis Dampier and early African-American player John Isaacs.\n\nCurrent NBA stars such as LeBron James and Kevin Durant will probably be here one day \u2014 and will owe a debt of gratitude to Haywood.\n\nHis battle with the NBA that went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1970 knocked down the age requirement that required players to be four years removed from high school. Once in the league, he went on to play 12 seasons, make four all-star teams and win a championship.\n\n\u201cRemember, guys, I had game,\u201d Haywood said. \u201cIt was not like I just did this Supreme Court thing. I had some serious game.\u201d\n\nSo did Mutombo, a fierce defender and shot blocker for 18 seasons. He said he was proud to have been the third African to play in the NBA, \u201cto come to the U.S. with nothing and now I\u2019m part of the NBA history.\u201d\n\nAnd he\u2019s giving back, opening a hospital in his homeland of Congo that he said has served 140,000 people. He twice won the NBA\u2019s J. Walter Kennedy Citizenship Award and now works for the league as a global ambassador.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Dikembe Mutombo, Spencer Haywood inducted into Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame", "title": "Dikembe Mutombo, Spencer Haywood inducted into Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/09/11/dikembe-mutombo-spencer-haywood-inducted-into-naismith-memorial-basketball-hall-of-fame/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-12T01:04:01+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-12T01:04:01+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd4bb\"", "article_summary": "\u2014 Spencer Haywood and Dikembe Mutombo were great players who accomplished as much or more off the court.\nHaywood, a former ABA Denver Rocket, and Mutombo, a former Nugget, were enshrined in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, part of a class of 11 players, coaches and referees.\nOnce in the league, he went on to play 12 seasons, make four all-star teams and win a championship.\nKentucky coach John Calipari was to be the last member of the class to speak at Symphony Hall.\nHe twice won the NBA\u2019s J.
