This year, it didn't.\n\nHere's why \u2013 and what's at stake.\n\nWhat is the battle about?\n\nIt all comes down to Medicaid expansion. Right now, Medicaid is only available in Florida for adults far below the federal poverty level, with a more generous sliding scale for children. Part of the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, calls for states to offer it to individuals and families who earn up to a third more than poverty level. But the Supreme Court said the federal government couldn't force states to participate.\n\nWhat does this have to do with Florida's budget?\n\nThe Florida Senate proposed an $80 billion budget that would include a version of Medicaid expansion more in keeping with the largely Republican legislature's free market ideals. If the feds accept the Senate's program, Florida stands to gain more than $60 billion over the next decade to fund it.\n\nThe Florida House wants nothing to do with Medicaid expansion \u2013 or the federal dollars that come with it -- and its budget is set at $76 billion. That $4 billion difference has created the impasse.\n\nWhy does the Senate want to expand Medicaid?\n\nThe Senate would offer a program through private insurers. Recipients would pay a small premium and prove they are employed or going to school. If the federal government accepts the program \u2013 a pretty big \"if\" \u2013 then the state would receive billions in federal money over the next decade. Some 800,000 Floridians would gain access to health care. A study by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Urban Institute, both of which support Obamacare, found that if Florida does not expand Medicaid, it will lose out on $66.1 billion over the next decade.\n\nSo why not set up a program that brings tax money back to Florida?\n\nThere's no such thing as free money. The federal government would pay for the entire program for the first three years, with the state picking up a little more of the cost each year afterward. In 10 years, the state would be responsible for 10 percent of the cost, where it would max out. That may be a small percentage of the total cost, but it's still new spending. And that means new taxes or cuts to other programs.\n\nDon't poor people get free health care at hospitals anyway?\n\nThere's no such thing as free health care. Hospitals that treat many low-income people who can't pay medical bills get paid for their services through a program called the Low Income Pool, or LIP.\n\nSo what's LIP got to do with it?\n\nThe LIP program, in place since 2006, matches local tax dollars that are used to pay hospitals that treat the poor. Last year, the feds matched $1.3 billion. But a year ago, they told Florida the LIP program would have to change. The House initially included the usual LIP funding in its budget anyway, but the feds linked LIP funding to Medicaid expansion. Just before they left Tallahassee early, House leaders offered the Senate a budget with $200 million in hospital funding \u2013 still far lower than the billions in LIP money. The Senate did not appear to take that proposal seriously.\n\nWhat if we lose LIP?\n\nThe couple billion dollars lost would devastate hospitals \u2013 according to hospitals. But Gov. Rick Scott isn't so sure, and created a Commission on Healthcare and Hospital Funding. \"The commission will examine how taxpayer money supports hospitals, health care and insurance plans in Florida and what health care outcomes those entities provide for Floridians in return,\" Scott said. The group will look at hospital funding over the next few weeks to see just how much money Florida needs to refund hospitals for charity work.\n\nSo we don't have a budget. What now?\n\nIt has to happen by July 1. And that means all legislators will probably be back in Tallahassee in June, when the in-fighting over Medicaid and LIP will resume. On Thursday, Senate President Andy Gardiner proposed a special session June 1-20. So far, there has been no response from the House or the governor.\n\nWhat happens if they can't agree by July 1?\n\nThe state government shuts down. The state budget funds schools, universities, hospitals \u2013 even federal programs like Medicaid and Medicare are administered through the state. Many agencies could operate on reserves in the short term, though for just how long is hard to say because this has never happened before.\n\nSo, did lawmakers just waste 60 days doing nothing?\n\nNo. This year, they passed more than 200 laws. Many were resolutions or technical fixes to laws already on the books, but there were some significant changes, such as a waiting period for abortions and the legalization of 64-ounce bottles of beer. So, progress.
