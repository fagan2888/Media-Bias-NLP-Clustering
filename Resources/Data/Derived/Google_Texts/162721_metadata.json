Its team surveyed 1,100 people\u2014U.S. residents, ranging in age from 18 to 45\u2014asking them about the terms they use to describe some of the most common objects and actions of digital life. And about the way they pronounce those terms when they're discussing them IRL, which is pronounced I-R-L. The team, a representative told me, started by issuing a round of questions to 200 people, asking for open-ended answers; once they got a selection of three or four common terms\u2014\"remote,\" for example, as well as \"remote control,\" \"clicker,\" and \"controller\"\u2014they polled the entire group to get a sense of the popularity of each term.\n\nTheir findings? \"Remote,\" it turns out, is much more commonly used than \"clicker.\" But there were more surprising findings, as well. For example: More than 30 percent of eBay's respondents pronounce the word \"meme\" as \"me-me,\" which is as fun to say as it is incorrect. And nearly 43 percent of those respondents pronounce \"data\" as \"dah-tuh,\" eBay said\u2014a nod to the original Latin, maybe, but also a snub to certain androids.\n\nAnd the whole \"gif\" vs. \"jif\" thing? Nearly 54 percent of respondents use the hard-g version, compared to nearly 41 percent who use the soft. And more than 5 percent use another pronunciation entirely\u2014which makes you wonder whether there's a group of Americans going to Buzzfeed, scrolling down, and remarking to themselves about all the animated jeefs.\n\nHere are more of their findings:\n\nGif vs. Jif\n\neBay Deals\n\nMeme\n\neBay Deals\n\nMobile Phone\n\neBay Deals\n\nFlash Drive\n\neBay Deals\n\nTrolling\n\neBay Deals\n\nRemote Control\n\neBay Deals\n\nHashtag\n\neBay Deals\n\nBooting Up\n\neBay Deals\n\nAvatar\n\neBay Deals\n\nOnline Search\n\neBay Deals\n\n'Data'\n\neBay Deals\n\n'Wifi'", "article_metadata": {"description": "More than 30 percent of us say \"meme\" as \"me-me\" ... and other findings from a new survey", "author": "Megan Garber", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "More than 30 percent of us say \"meme\" as \"me-me\" ... and other findings from a new survey", "title": "Only 5 Percent of Americans Call It a 'Mobile Phone'", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2014/06/Screen_Shot_2014_06_23_at_8.07.22_AM/lead_large.png", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/06/why-fi-or-wiffy-how-americans-pronounce-techs-most-common-terms/373082/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "For example: More than 30 percent of eBay's respondents pronounce the word \"meme\" as \"me-me,\" which is as fun to say as it is incorrect.\nHere are more of their findings:Gif vs. JifeBay DealsMemeeBay DealsMobile PhoneeBay DealsFlash DriveeBay DealsTrollingeBay DealsRemote ControleBay DealsHashtageBay DealsBooting UpeBay DealsAvatareBay DealsOnline SearcheBay Deals'Data'eBay Deals'Wifi'\nAnd about the way they pronounce those terms when they're discussing them IRL, which is pronounced I-R-L.\nAnd nearly 43 percent of those respondents pronounce \"data\" as \"dah-tuh,\" eBay said\u2014a nod to the original Latin, maybe, but also a snub to certain androids.\nresidents, ranging in age from 18 to 45\u2014asking them about the terms they use to describe some of the most common objects and actions of digital life."}
