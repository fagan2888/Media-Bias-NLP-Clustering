He is a reporter for USA Today.\n\nSo, what were the numbers? What were the women saying happened?\n\nTOM VANDEN BROOK, USA Today: Well, Hari, of those reporting sexual assault in the military among the ranks, it was 62 percent of the women said that they had received some form of retaliation after making those reports.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: So, in \u2014 then, to put this in context, the number of reported cases has gone down, right?\n\nTOM VANDEN BROOK: That\u2019s right.\n\nI mean, the \u2014 well, actually, the prevalence of cases, so the ones that they estimate has gone down to about 20,000. And that is a 27 percent decrease from 2012.\n\nThe actual folks coming forward and reporting, that has gone up in this year about 11 percent to 6,000 cases.\n\nThe military perceives that to be progress, in that people feel comfortable enough to come forward and make a report of a sexual assault.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: So, the Pentagon did take steps over the last year to try to make it easier to report.\n\nBut if women come forward through these easier channels, but still face retaliation at higher rates, would that have maybe a chilling effect?\n\nTOM VANDEN BROOK: You would think so. I think that would be a major problem for them.\n\nAgain, if you are talking about 6,000 reports and an estimate of 20,000 instances of this, you are still having less than a third of the people reporting the crime.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: Are there any protections in place, like whistle-blower protections?\n\nIf this was to happen in the private sector, and if you turned in your boss for illegal activities or sexual harassment, there are pretty tried-and-true ways where you could be protected.\n\nIs that also the case in the military?\n\nTOM VANDEN BROOK: Well, sure, there are plenty of protections, but you still \u2014 some women \u2014 the majority of people reporting that they have been retaliated against, it is a \u2014 it\u2019s a social problem.\n\nThey are being excluded from activities, from parties, things that may seem somewhat trivial when I mention them, but not really, because, if you are excluded from this sort of thing, it can hurt your advancement.\n\nAnd it certainly can make the workplace hostile.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: And there was also some information that came out in one of these reports about men who were \u2014 who had sort of harassment or sexual assault happen to them, but how they perceived it was very different. Explain that.\n\nTOM VANDEN BROOK: That\u2019s a big problem for them, Hari.\n\nThey \u2014 they \u2014 a lot of the men don\u2019t perceive what has happened to them, which is truly a sexual assault, as \u2014 as an assault or a crime.\n\nMost often, they view it as some sort of strange initiation right or harassment, so they are not reporting it. And that is a big issue for the military.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: So, what does the Pentagon do about all this?\n\nTOM VANDEN BROOK: More and more education, I guess. That\u2019s the main thing that they are trying to do, to get this across that these sorts of things are, you know, no longer acceptable, not that they ever really were.\n\nI talked a to a Marine officer this week who said, this is not acceptable in any \u2014 in any sense, but they need to drive the point home to their \u2014 their young soldiers and Marines.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: All right. Tom Vanden Brook of USA Today, thanks so much.\n\nTOM VANDEN BROOK: Thank you, Hari.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: Take an in-depth look at the findings of the Pentagon report on sexual assault in the military.
