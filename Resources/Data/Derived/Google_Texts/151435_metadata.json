However, instead of rewarding online customers by giving them a discount for making the switch to electronic billing they simply devised this new fee for the service of getting paper bills in the mail. Valued by some estimates at over $700 million annually, this fee especially targets seniors, immigrants, those with disabilities, folks with little access to the internet and people on a fixed income \u2014 in other words, some of Canada's most vulnerable citizens.\n\nIn the summer of 2012, a retired constituent complained to me that some companies were charging him an extra $2 to receive bills in the mail. He didn't have a computer, so online billing was not an option. Soon others began raising the issue with me, including those who managed their elderly parents' finances. They felt ripped off and powerless.\n\nOn the face of it, the fight against fees for paper bills may seem like an unlikely campaign to showcase the power of grassroots democracy. But when a micro ripoff reaps mega bucks for some of Canada's most powerful companies, while our federal government stands idly by, maybe it's a test case.\n\nBetween the lines is a search for something counter to the narrative that all is broken in our political process. Indeed a lot may be broken, but when people find ways to make tangible change it is worth considering how they did it.\n\nHaving been in rock and roll bands for 25 years, people often ask me now about my job as a politician: \u201cAndrew isn\u2019t it frustrating? Can you really get anything done?\u201d\n\nBased on constituent concern and the galling unfairness of it all, my office decided to launch a petition campaign in Davenport to pressure the Harper government.\n\nNow, you may be surprised to hear that there are similarities between politics and rock and roll. For both, when you mount a project, the first thing you need is a good name. We asked one of our volunteers, Wyatt Shorter, who at the time was a high school student, if he had any ideas that would best describe this ripoff. \u201cHow about pay to pay,\u201d he suggested, \u201cbecause you have to pay a fee to pay your bill.\u201d That was it!\n\nWith the help of another remarkable young Portuguese-speaking volunteer, Sara Marques, we met with immigrant seniors' groups in the area who wanted action. Aided by years of solid reporting on the issue, primarily by the Star, consumer and seniors advocates gave their support, and within days of its posting thousands had signed our petition online.\n\nStill the government sat on its hands, claiming that a volunteer code of conduct was enough to protect Canadians from unfair billing practices. But as the pressure mounted, with the petition soon surpassing 10,000 signatures from people across the country, a shift began to take hold. The CRTC, Canada\u2019s telecom and broadcast regulator, was initially dismissive but later sent a letter asking Bell to stop charging the fee to seniors. Other companies began considering exemptions.\n\nHowever these were ineffectual measures and the government signalled in its Speech from the Throne last October that a ban was on the way. I laughed out loud in the lobby of the House of Commons when I heard the Governor General say the words \u201cpay to pay,\u201d doubtless the Queen's representative in Canada had no idea he was using a phrase coined by a high school student in Davenport.\n\nNext the CRTC launched an exhaustive study, finding that some companies were charging up to $5.95 for a paper bill. After failing again to get companies to voluntarily do the right thing, the government was forced to announce this summer that it would finally table legislation to ban pay-to-pay fees outright.\n\nOf course with the Harper government the devil is in the details and we will wait to see what, if any, legislation comes forward. However after the announcement I immediately thought of Wyatt, Sarah, the Portuguese seniors and the many other volunteers with whom I knocked on doors. This was their victory.\n\nDoes it spell the end of customers getting fleeced? Nope. Does it signal that this government is capable of standing up to those fleecing us? Likely not. Is it good for democracy that people fought back and won against some of the largest, most profitable corporations in Canada and forced their government to finally act? Absolutely!\n\nAndrew Cash is the Member of Parliament for Davenport.", "article_metadata": {"description": "What began as a small grassroots campaign against 'pay-to-pay' bills now seems to be on the verge of changing federal law.
