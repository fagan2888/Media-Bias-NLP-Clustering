Lindsey Graham thinks the people of the United States need to be very afraid of ISIS. But do they need to be afraid of Caitlyn Jenner? Not so much, says Graham.\n\nIn an interview with CNN\u2019s Dana Bash that aired on Sunday morning, the South Carolina Republican flouted the conventions of his party\u2019s social conservatives by referring to Caitlyn Jenner, the former Olympian and later reality television star Bruce Jenner, by her chosen name and pointedly used the pronoun \u201cshe\u201d while saying that Jenner is welcome in his Republican Party.\n\nRelated: Lindsey Graham \u2013 Prudent or Paranoid Over ISIS\n\n\u201cIf Caitlyn Jenner wants to be safe and have a prosperous economy, vote for me,\u201d Graham said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m into addition. I haven\u2019t walked in...\u201d here Graham paused, before saying, with slight emphasis, \u201cher shoes. I don\u2019t have all the answers to the mysteries of life. I can only imagine the torment that Bruce Jenner went through. I hope he\u2014\u201d then quickly correcting himself, \u201cI hope she\u2014has found peace. I\u2019m a pro-life, traditional marriage kind of guy, but I am running to be president of the United States. If Caitlyn Jenner wants to be a Republican, she is welcome in my Party.\u201d\n\nIn the pre-recorded interview, Graham sat with Bash in Iowa, at an event held by freshman Republican Sen. Joni Ernst, which attracted many GOP candidates to the early primary state.\n\nBash, who had begun the line of questioning by quoting a conservative Iowa Republican talk radio host who said that if the GOP did not stand up for traditional gender identification it would lose voters, then asked, \u201cSo Republicans should reach out to people like her? To transgender Americans?\u201d\n\nRelated: The GOP Hunger Games \u2013 Who Will Make the Debate Cut?\n\nGraham replied, \u201cUnderstand what you\u2019re getting in Lindsey Graham. I\u2019m pro-life, pro-marriage, without animosity. The courts are going to rule probably in June about traditional marriage. I will accept the court\u2019s decision.\u201d\n\nMoving back to Jenner, he said, \u201cHere\u2019s what I would say to the talk show host: In the eyes of radical Islam, they hate you just as much as they hate Caitlyn Jenner. They hate us all because we won\u2019t agree to their view of religion. So America, we are all in this together.\u201d\n\nGraham\u2019s willingness to accept Jenner as female rather than male stands in stark contrast to the party\u2019s religious conservatives, who vary between condemning and mocking those who identify as transgendered.\n\nLast week, for instance, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, also running for the Republican nomination, faced criticism when a recording of a speech he gave earlier this year was uncovered. In it, he appeared to belittle people with non-traditional gender identities.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "As a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, Sen.", "title": "Lindsey Graham: Caitlyn Jenner \u2018Welcome\u2019 in My GOP", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/06/07/Lindsey-Graham-Caitlyn-Jenner-Welcome-My-GOP", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Caitlin%20Jenner.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/06/07/Lindsey-Graham-Caitlyn-Jenner-Welcome-My-GOP", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Caitlin%20Jenner.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "As a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, Sen.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe242c\"", "article_summary": "Related: Lindsey Graham \u2013 Prudent or Paranoid Over ISIS\u201cIf Caitlyn Jenner wants to be safe and have a prosperous economy, vote for me,\u201d Graham said.\nGraham replied, \u201cUnderstand what you\u2019re getting in Lindsey Graham.\nBut do they need to be afraid of Caitlyn Jenner?\nAs a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, Sen.
