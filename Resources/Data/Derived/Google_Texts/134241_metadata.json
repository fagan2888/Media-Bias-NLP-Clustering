Flood insurance premiums have been rising, too, as the National Flood Insurance Program deals with a massive deficit of about $24 billion and raises rates to better reflect the risks.\n\nFor anyone who owns a home or business, or is thinking about buying one, this is becoming an increasingly important financial issue. As flood insurance costs rise, so does the expense of owning property that\u2019s in a flood zone. And as the cost of ownership rises, the value of some properties could be hurt.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just about waterfront property. Consider that 60 percent of the homes built in Charleston County in the years just before the recession were built in the flood plain. There\u2019s not a great deal of high ground in the Lowcountry.\n\nThere are plenty of Charleston area neighborhoods and subdivisions where some homes are in a flood zone and others are not. Outside a flood zone, flood insurance is optional and far less expensive. Within a flood zone, insurance would be required for owners with a mortage, and that could add hundreds of dollars, or even more, to the monthly cost of ownership.\n\nFor those who aren\u2019t in a flood zone, or don\u2019t have a mortgage, flood insurance becomes a question of weighing risks and costs \u2014 the bottom line with any insurance decision. In a state where 24-hour rainfall records have exceeded a foot of water in some counties, in a coastal area where the storm surge from a Hugo-sized hurricane could exceed 20 feet, there\u2019s a lot of risk to consider.\n\nOne important financial factor to remember is South Carolina\u2019s income tax credit for homeowners with excessive insurance costs. It\u2019s not complicated and can ease the financial pain of high home insurance costs, but it\u2019s clear from the number of people who have claimed the tax credit that it\u2019s not well-known.\n\nHere\u2019s how the state\u2019s Excess Insurance Premium Tax Credit works: If the cost of insuring your primary residence exceeds 5 percent of your federal adjusted gross income, the state will cover the difference, up to $1,250 yearly, as a credit on your state income tax return. The tax credit reduces the income tax you owe the state, dollar for dollar.\n\nSo once the cost of insuring your home hits 5 percent of your income, the state will essentially pay the next $1,250 in premiums. However, if you don\u2019t owe income tax to the state \u2014 as is the case for many retired people \u2014 then you can\u2019t take advantage of the tax credit.\n\nFlooding is a risk for renters, too, and it\u2019s important to remember that renters insurance typically does not cover damage from flooding (other than flooding caused by a pipe bursting in the rented structure). Renters, like owners, can get flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance Program.\n\nRenters should not rely on a landlord\u2019s assurance that a property doesn\u2019t flood, or hasn\u2019t flooded in the past, but should check a property\u2019s flood map rating. Any property can escape flooding for years, yet still face a relatively high risk.\n\nFor example, a 1 percent annual chance of flooding doesn\u2019t sound like much chance at all, but that\u2019s the definition of a 100-year flood risk, and defines the federal high-risk \u201cAE\u201d flood zone. The Charlestowne Village Mobile Home Park off Dorchester Road, where flooding caused extensive damage, is in such a zone according to Federal Emergency Management Agency maps.\n\nWant to get some idea of your risk? You can visit floodsmart.gov and type in your address to check. It\u2019s the official website of the National Flood Insurance Program.\n\nWant more details? Visit FEMA\u2019s Flood Map Service Center online at msc.fema.gov and see the flood plain maps. The maps can be tricky to navigate online, but instead of just getting a general idea of your property\u2019s flood risk, you can see the boundaries of different flood zones and get a better idea of where you stand.\n\nNote that federal flood maps are being updated, so the high-risk flood areas could change. To see when the flood map for your community will be updated, click the \u201cnew flood maps\u201d option on the floodsmart.gov website. Many of those new maps are scheduled to take effect, for flood insurance rates, late next year.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Recent deluge illustrates widespread risk of flooding across the Charleston area, Business-Local, \r\nBusiness-LocalReal Estate, \r\nFP LatestNews, \r\nDavid Slade, \r\nDavid Slade, David Slade,flood insurance,flooding,personal finance", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "The past week\u2019s deluge across the Greater Charleston area brought tales of hours-long commutes, people being rescued from water-logged neighborhoods by boat, and the now-routine photos of cars stuck on flooded streets and people kayaking in un", "title": "Recent deluge illustrates widespread risk of flooding across the Charleston area", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20150906/150909739/recent-deluge-illustrates-widespread-risk-of-flooding-across-the-charleston-area", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150906/PC05/150909739/AR/0/AR-150909739.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150906/PC05/150909739/AR/0/AR-150909739.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The past week\u2019s deluge across the Greater Charleston area brought tales of hours-long commutes, people being rescued from water-logged neighborhoods by boat, and the now-routine photos of cars stuck on flooded streets and people kayaking in un", "title": "Recent deluge illustrates widespread risk of flooding across the Charleston area", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150906/PC05/150909739/AR/0/AR-150909739.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 150909739}}, "keywords": "Recent deluge illustrates widespread risk of flooding across the Charleston area , Business-Local, \r\nBusiness-LocalReal Estate, \r\nFP LatestNews, \r\nDavid Slade, \r\nDavid Slade, David Slade,flood insurance,flooding,personal finance", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-06T09:00:00Z", "modified_time": "2015-09-04T13:20:00Z", "author": "David Slade"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "The past week\u2019s deluge across the Greater Charleston area brought tales of hours-long commutes, people being rescued from water-logged neighborhoods by boat, and the now-routine photos of cars stuck on flooded streets and people kayaking in un"}, "article_summary": "Renters, like owners, can get flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance Program.\nFlood insurance premiums have been rising, too, as the National Flood Insurance Program deals with a massive deficit of about $24 billion and raises rates to better reflect the risks.\nOutside a flood zone, flood insurance is optional and far less expensive.\nAs flood insurance costs rise, so does the expense of owning property that\u2019s in a flood zone.\nThere are plenty of Charleston area neighborhoods and subdivisions where some homes are in a flood zone and others are not."}
