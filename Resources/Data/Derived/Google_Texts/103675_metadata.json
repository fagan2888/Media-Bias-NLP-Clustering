Lewis, the Christian icon and author of classics such as \u201cMere Christianity\u201d and \u201cThe Chronicles of Narnia.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s tempting to remember Lewis only as the self-assured defender of Christianity who never met an argument he couldn't demolish. His death 50 years ago, on November 22, 1963, was overshadowed by the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. He has since become a patron saint of American evangelicals.\n\nBut the actual man whom friends called \u201cJack\u201d had a \u201chorrible\u201d personal life, thought he had failed as a defender of Christianity and spent so much time in pubs that his publishers initially struggled selling him to a religious audience, scholars say.\n\n\u201cAmerican publishers worried about offending their more puritanical readers because it seemed impossible to get a dust jacket picture of Jack without a pint or a cigarette,\u201d says Michael Tomko, a literature professor at Villanova University in Pennsylvania.\n\nThere are three other parts of Lewis\u2019 life that clash with his image as well:\n\n1. His religious books made him poor\n\nNo modern Christian author sells like Lewis. The cumulative sales of his Christian books for adults - not including the Christian allegory and children's fantasy \"The Chronicles of Narnia\" - now approach 10 million copies, according to HarperOne publishers. \u201cMere Christianity\u201d sold more than 150,000 copies over the past year alone. Perhaps the only publishing parallel to Lewis' works would be \u201cThe Lord of the Rings\u201d trilogy, a mythology written by Lewis\u2019 close friend and fellow Christian J.R.R. Tolkien.\n\nBut Lewis never got rich from his Christian classics, says Michael Maudlin, executive editor at HarperOne.\n\n\u201cHis books left him poor,\u201d Maudlin said. \u201cHe had all of this money coming in, but he didn\u2019t take those royalties.\u201d\n\nLewis vowed to donate all the money he made from his books on Christianity, Maudlin says. He got big tax bills for his Christian books but struggled to pay them because he had given the money away.\n\nLewis refused to renounce his vow even though his money worries persisted throughout his life, Maudlin says.\n\n\u201cHe is a man whose number one anxiety in life was poverty,\u201d Maudlin said. \u201cBecause his dad overspent, money was always a worry. He didn\u2019t fix things in his home because he and his brother worried about poverty.\u201d\n\nLewis\u2019 financial worries stalked him until the end, says Alister McGrath, author of the acclaimed new book \u201cC.S. Lewis: A Life.\u201d\n\nLewis\u2019 health began to fail near the end of his life, so he wanted to hire a private secretary to help tend to his affairs. His income, though, was so spotty that he told his potential secretary that he didn\u2019t know whether he could pay him, McGrath writes.\n\nLewis was more worried about losing his teaching salary from the University of Cambridge than his book royalties, says McGrath, a professor at King's College London.\n\n\u201cLewis was convinced that his books would cease to be popular and thus generate little in the way of income,\u201d McGrath said.\n\n2. He felt like a failure as a Christian communicator\n\n\"Brilliant\" is one of the most common words used to describe Lewis. He seemed to have read everything, and he could easily write in several genres: children\u2019s fantasy, science fiction, Christian apologetics and autobiography.\n\n\u201cHe had an almost photographic memory,\u201d Maudlin said. \u201cHe could recite the passage and page of a line from a book on medieval poetry.\u201d\n\nLewis was not so adept in the ordinary world. He never learned to drive or type because he was too clumsy. And he was a shabby dresser who lived in a house that was falling apart.\n\nHe even began to doubt his ability to defend Christianity.\n\nLewis' breakthrough came as a Christian apologist, one who publicly defends and explains Christianity by invoking logic. He delivered a series of talks on Christianity for BBC radio during World War II that made him famous (you can hear some of those talks on YouTube). His fame crossed the Atlantic in 1947 when he made the cover of Time magazine.\n\nBut just as his fame peaked in the 1940s, Lewis began to doubt his persuasive powers, McGrath says.\n\nDebating Christianity in public became \u201cdraining\u201d for Lewis, McGrath says. At a 1945 lecture on Christian apologetics, according to McGrath, Lewis said, \u201cNothing is more dangerous to one\u2019s own faith than the work of an apologist. No doctrine of that faith seems to me so spectral, so unreal as one that I have just successfully defended in a public debate.\u201d\n\nLewis then lost a highly publicized debate to Elizabeth Anscombe, a young Catholic philosopher who pointed out inconsistencies in his reasoning. They clashed over passages in his book \u201cMiracles,\u201d which he later revised. Lewis\u2019 confidence was shaken further when he realized that his argumentative powers had little effect on some of his closest friends and relatives, who remained hostile to Christianity, McGrath says.\n\nLewis thought that he had \u201cfailed as an apologist towards those who were closest to him,\u201d McGrath writes. \u201cHow could Lewis maintain a profile as a public apologist with any integrity in the light of such private failures?\u201d\n\nWhen the BBC asked Lewis to participate in a discussion on the evidence of religious faith, he declined: \u201cLike the old fangless snake in 'The Jungle Book,' I\u2019ve largely lost my dialectical power.\u201d\n\nSome contend that even Lewis\u2019 faith failed him.\n\nHe lost love not long after finding it late in his life: Joy Davidman was an American writer who befriended Lewis by letter and eventually became his wife. She died of cancer at 45 with Lewis at her bedside. Their love affair was depicted in the 1993 film \u201cShadowlands.\u201d\n\nLewis had written about God and suffering in a book entitled \u201cThe Problem of Pain.\u201d But when he wrote about losing his wife in \u201cA Grief Observed,\u201d he was a different man, says Ivan Strenski, a religious studies professor at the University of California, Riverside.\n\n\u201cThe cocky self-confidence is totally destroyed,\u201d Strenski said. \u201cThe confident, modern interpreter of Christianity is gone. He\u2019s really a shattered Christian.\u201d\n\n3. He had a \"horrible\" personal life\n\nWhen the University of St. Andrews in Scotland awarded Lewis an honorary degree in 1945, Lewis gloomily joked that he preferred getting a \u201ccase of Scotch whiskey.\u201d\n\nLewis needed some escape at the time. His personal life was a wreck. The man who seemed like the embodiment of self-control and virtue in his books had a personal life complicated by dysfunction and deceit.\n\nLewis\u2019 personal struggles began early. His beloved mother, Flora, died when he was 9; he never really got along with his father, Albert; and he was sent away to a miserable boarding school where a schoolmaster was literally declared insane.\n\n\u201cIt was horrible,\" Maudlin said of Lewis\u2019 personal life.\n\nThen Lewis experienced another horror \u2013 trench warfare in World War I - but he rarely talked about the experience. Nor did he talk much about the promise he made during the war to his fellow soldier and friend Paddy Moore.\n\nLewis assured Moore that he would take care of his mother if Paddy didn\u2019t survive the war. Moore was killed, and Lewis fulfilled his vow after returning home. Lewis moved in with Paddy\u2019s mother, Janie Moore, and helped raise her daughter, Maureen.\n\nLewis\u2019 relationship with Janie Moore is still mystery. Some scholars say they became lovers; others say she was more like his mother. Lewis, though, hid the relationship from his father and his colleagues at Oxford University.\n\n\u201cThere was an attraction between the two of them from the very beginning,\u201d said Warren Rochelle, an English professor at the University of Mary Washington in Virginia.\n\n\u201cWhen he first met her, she was 45, almost the exact age when Lewis\u2019 mother died, and it\u2019s clear from correspondence that they found each other attractive and engaging,\u201d Rochelle said.\n\nLewis had another complicated relationship at home with his brother Warren, or \u201cWarnie,\" an alcoholic who moved in with Lewis and Janie Moore. Warnie couldn\u2019t stand her.\n\nAs Janie Moore grew older, she lapsed into dementia. The demands of caring for an alcoholic brother and a disabled woman proved so difficult for Lewis that he was hospitalized for exhaustion at one point. Yet Lewis took care of Janie Moore and her daughter even as she presumably stopped being his lover, scholars say.\n\n\u201cShe gave him stability, a family and a mother figure,\u201d Rochelle said. \u201cShe gave him a lover for a while, but no one can prove it.\u201d\n\nLewis\u2019 sexual proclivities also clash with the images of the reserved Englishman who touted the virtues of abstinence before marriage in \u201cMere Christianity.\u201d\n\nLewis displayed an interest in sadomasochism during his youth. He read the writings of the Marquis de Sade; once became drunk at a party and begged people to allow him to whip them; and signed three letters to friend Arthur Greeves with the closing \u201clover of the whip,\u201d according to McGrath\u2019s biography.\n\nLewis befriended Greeves during childhood, and the two remained close throughout his life. Greeves was gay, but that didn\u2019t seem to bother Lewis.\n\n\u201cLewis was aware of Greeves\u2019 homosexuality and made it clear that this would not be a problem within their friendship,\u201d McGrath said. \u201cHe also made it clear that he didn\u2019t share Greeves\u2019 orientation.\u201d\n\nDespite Lewis' personal hardships, those who've studied him say his kindness was as impressive as his intellect.\n\nLewis didn\u2019t try to hide from a public that sought his counsel after he became famous. He made no attempt to conceal his phone number. He rose at daybreak to answer letters from people seeking spiritual advice.\n\nHe even made personal visits. A priest once wrote Lewis that he didn\u2019t know whether he believed in a loving God anymore. Lewis met the man and spent an afternoon talking to him about his problem, wrote A.N. Wilson, author of, \u201cC.S. Lewis: A Biography.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe priest, who had expected the author of 'The Problem of Pain' to look pale and ethereal, was astonished by the red-faced pork butcher in shabby tweeds whom he actually encountered,\u201d Wilson wrote.\n\nLewis is still surprising people 50 years later. His ability to reach people long after his death is astonishing, some say.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s odd that someone has been so popular for so long,\u201d Maudlin said. \u201cLewis\u2019 books are still in front of the bookstore. We grew up with him, so we lose touch with how unusual that is.\u201d\n\nThe Christian icon whose image we see in bookstores may first seem distant. He spoke and dressed like a prim Englishman from another time. But his life was messy, contradictory and tarnished by thwarted dreams.\n\nPerhaps Lewis still speaks to us because we when we look closer at his life, he\u2019s really not that unusual.\n\nWe see ourselves.", "article_metadata": {"description": "By John Blake, CNN (CNN) -- He looked like a \u201cred-faced pork butcher in shabby tweeds,\u201d lived secretly with a woman for years and was so turned on by S&amp;M that he once asked people at a party whether he could spank them.
