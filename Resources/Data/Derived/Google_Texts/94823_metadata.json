Ted Cruz compared the glitches plaguing the website for President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health care law to the methodologies of \u201cNigerian email scammers.\u201d\n\nThe Tea Party favorite received a rousing ovation during a rally of more than 1,000 supporters Monday in Houston while speaking out about the Affordable Care Act, known also as Obamacare.\n\n\u201cYou may have noticed that all the Nigerian email scammers have become a lot less active lately,\u201d Cruz said, according to the Houston Chronicle. \u201cThey all have been hired to run the Obamacare website.\u201d\n\nCruz told supporters that he\u2019s working for them and not for D.C. \u201cparty bosses.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople are saying mean things about me,\u201d Cruz said, according to the Chronicle. \u201cWho cares? At the end of the day, I don\u2019t work for the party bosses in Washington. I work for each and every one of you. What they don\u2019t understand is that we\u2019re standing here together. We\u2019ve got a problem in Washington. They\u2019re not listening to the American people.\u201d\n\nCruz staged a quasi-filibuster for over 21 hours in the Senate late last month, helping spark a budget fight in the Republican-led House that partially shuttered the government in an attempt to sever funding for the nation\u2019s new health care law.\n\nThen, with the country facing a debt default, leaders in the Democratic-led Senate brokered a deal to end the standoff \u2014 which Cruz dismissed as \u201cselling the American people down the river.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t win a fight when your own team is firing cannons at the people who are standing up and leading, which are the House Republicans,\u201d he said.\n\nThe deal sets up the potential for another budget showdown in January. Senate GOP leaders, however, have suggested that there won\u2019t be a repeat of the shutdown or a potential default crisis like in recent weeks.\n\nSome political observers now see Cruz as Texas\u2019 most popular Republican. But his approval ratings across the country may be slipping.\n\nNational polls have shown that while Americans in general don\u2019t love the health care law, they oppose defunding it \u2014 especially if it means shutting down the government. And many of Cruz\u2019s Senate colleagues have bemoaned the shutdown for tarnishing the GOP\u2019s image.\n\n(TM and \u00a9 Copyright 2013 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.
