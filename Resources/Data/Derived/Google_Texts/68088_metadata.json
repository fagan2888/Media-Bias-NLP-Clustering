Supporters of Maness, however, called Cassidy a \u201cducker\u201d and blew duck calls as they waited for the debate to begin.\n\nLandrieu and Maness sparred over Obamacare and illegal immigration, though Landrieu made a point of expressing her gratitude to Maness, a retired Air Force colonel, for his service to the country. Strategically, Landrieu benefits from a strong performance by Maness in the \u201cjungle primary,\u201d since every new vote for Maness probably is taken from Cassidy and inches Landrieu towards the magical \u201cno run-off\u201d 50%.\n\nLandrieu asserted, \u201c[t]he Affordable Care Act is not perfect, but it is working in many important ways.\u201d\n\nManess, appearing in his first political debate ever, countered, \u201cObamacare is an abomination. One of my top priorities,\u201d he added,\u201dis not to repeal or defund it, but pull it out by the roots because it\u2019s a job killer.\u201d\n\nOn immigration, Landrieu, who voted for the 2013 \u201cGang of Eight\u201d immigration reform bill many conservatives have characterized as pro-amnesty, said that \u201c[i]t\u2019s important that we have a legal pathway to citizenship.\u201d\n\nManess, who has signed the FAIR pledge opposing amnesty, hit back, noting that his opposition was based on the fact that \u201cI respect American citizens and their need for jobs.\u201d\n\nManess also took advantage of Cassidy\u2019s absence by making a claim that Cassidy would almost certainly have disputed had he been in attendance. \u201cBoth of my opponents support either amnesty for illegal aliens or a pathway to citizenship for illegal aliens,\u201d he said.\n\nCassidy, who chose to attend his own campaign event in Alexandria instead of the debate, is scheduled to participate in a debate with both Landrieu and Maness that will be broadcast live on public television next week.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Mary Landrieu Defends Obamacare at Louisiana Senate Debate: 'Working in Many Important Ways'", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Mary Landrieu Defends Obamacare at Louisiana Senate Debate: 'Working in Many Important Ways'", "title": "Mary Landrieu Defends Obamacare at Louisiana Senate Debate: 'Working in Many Important Ways' - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2014/Congress/Senate-Democrats/mary-landrieu-thumbs-up-ap.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2014/10/10/landrieu-and-maness-attack-no-show-cassidy-at-louisiana-senate-debate/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Mary Landrieu Defends Obamacare at Louisiana Senate Debate: 'Working in Many Important Ways'", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2014/Congress/Senate-Democrats/mary-landrieu-thumbs-up-ap.jpg", "title": "Mary Landrieu Defends Obamacare at Louisiana Senate Debate: 'Working in Many Important Ways' - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Mary Landrieu, Politico, Senate,Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "Senate", "published_time": "2014-10-10T18:02:00-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe16a5\"", "article_summary": "Most polls show Landrieu and Cassidy neck and neck in this November\u2019s \u201cjungle primary,\u201d with Maness a distant third.\nLandrieu and Maness sparred over Obamacare and illegal immigration, though Landrieu made a point of expressing her gratitude to Maness, a retired Air Force colonel, for his service to the country.\nLandrieu asserted, \u201c[t]he Affordable Care Act is not perfect, but it is working in many important ways.\u201dManess, appearing in his first political debate ever, countered, \u201cObamacare is an abomination.\nSupporters of Maness, however, called Cassidy a \u201cducker\u201d and blew duck calls as they waited for the debate to begin.\n\u201cBoth of my opponents support either amnesty for illegal aliens or a pathway to citizenship for illegal aliens,\u201d he said."}
