As a small business owner in New York City, you also know how frustrating dealing with health insurance can be. Given all the changes, this is a mine field to figure out. As a result, while some small business owners have found secure coverage, many have opted out and offer no coverage for their employees, instead sending their employees to the individual market place.\n\nWhat a lot of small businesses don\u2019t know (but should) is that The Affordable Care Act also introduced the Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP), also known as the Small Business Marketplace in New York. It was created specifically for small businesses with employer tax credits not offered through the individual exchange.\n\nTo help make it easier EmblemHealth launched a Health Care Reform Hub offering everything a small business owner needs to know about SHOP and offers a Tax Calculator to help business owners determine the tax credits that their business might be eligible for.\n\n\n\nKey Points:\n\n1. Easy Enrollment\n\nAny company that has fewer than 50 employees* and a primary business address in the state of New York is eligible for small business health insurance.\n\n2. Tax Benefits\n\nDoes your business qualify? Check!\n\n3. Ability to Control Costs.\n\nAbility to choose you plan to match your budget.\n\n4. Flexibility for Your Employees\n\nFour plan levels allow you to choose premium and out of pocket cost. Great for employees!\n\nLearn more about SHOP and the options available for your small business.\n\nThis post is provided by and paid for by Emblem Health.
