Chris Rock and Jon Stewart, two of the sharpest wits out there, both seemed, at once, out-of-touch with the evening\u2019s mood and slightly neutered. Hugh Jackman\u2019s song-and-dance act was well-executed but light on jokes.\n\nBut jokes can be risky, too! Billy Crystal, fondly remembered for his many stints in the 1990s and early 2000s, came to rescue the 2012 ceremony after Eddie Murphy quit and got pilloried for blackface humor that might have been a little more widely accepted in the \u201990s, or the \u201920s. Crystal\u2019s booking had been a reaction against the previous year\u2019s show, when the academy had been trying to court a younger audience with hosts James Franco and Anne Hathaway (you may recall how that turned out); the year after Crystal, the academy tried to go young again with host Seth MacFarlane, whose tasteless humor seemed a deeply poor fit for the room.\n\nThis year\u2019s host is unlikely to reprise MacFarlane\u2019s \u201cWe Saw Your Boobs\u201d number \u2014 it\u2019s Ellen DeGeneres, the amiable daytime host who last had the gig in 2007. Oscar hosts are usually asked back, if they\u2019re going to be, within only a couple of years, and it seemed a fair presumption that Ellen would keep dancing on daytime TV exclusively. But the seven years since DeGeneres\u2019 perfectly competent gig have seen enough host-related tsuris that, finally, \u201cperfectly competent\u201d seems good enough.\n\nIn her first hosting turn, DeGeneres offended no one, though she did nothing exceptional. Her 2007 opening monologue had more truisms about what the Oscars are generally like than it did specific references to any of the year\u2019s nominees, and as such felt both offensive to no one, and sort of soft. It perfectly matched DeGeneres\u2019 real-life persona, one so familiar that it\u2019s weird to call her \u201cDeGeneres\u201d instead of plain old \u201cEllen.\u201d The talk-show host\u2019s monologues lightly touch on the absurdities of life, and her interviews are even softer than her awards-show jokes. Her Twitter feed, which has some 25 million followers, is mainly her saying hi to celebrities or making wince-inducing puns like \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful (Daniel) Day (Lewis)! Only 3 more until the Oscars.\u201d\n\nDeGeneres has styled herself as the safest thing going: She\u2019s not abrasive to the more sensitive of sensibilities, like Rock, Stewart or MacFarlane. She\u2019s not liable to offend anyone as would Goldberg or Crystal. She\u2019s very good at telling jokes, but those jokes are so inclusive as to be amiably unspecific.\n\nBut that may be exactly what the Oscars need. Even the most successful of awards-show hosts at other ceremonies \u2014 which is to say, the Golden Globes\u2019 Tina Fey-Amy Poehler pairing \u2014 would likely seem mean-spirited on the Oscars\u2019 stage. Whether the viewer takes the ceremony seriously or not, the ceremony takes itself seriously, and the pomp of the whole thing isn\u2019t the sort that can be deflated by a sassy or snarky host. Instead, it tends to eat whole those hosts who don\u2019t pay sufficient tribute to their surroundings. Whatever one may think of the Oscars, the ceremony is some eight decades old and has honored everything from \u201cCasablanca\u201d to \u201cAll About Eve\u201d to \u201cThe Godfather.\u201d You don\u2019t have to like it, but to mock it from beneath the proscenium is a good way to look unimpressive by comparison.", "article_metadata": {"description": "At the second most-watched TV event of the year, there's no shame in being a crowd-pleaser VIDEO", "title": "Why Ellen is the perfect Oscar host", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "At the second most-watched TV event of the year, there's no shame in being a crowd-pleaser VIDEO", "title": "Why Ellen is the perfect Oscar host", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/03/03/why_ellen_is_the_perfect_oscar_host/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/ellen_degeneres2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "At the second most-watched TV event of the year, there's no shame in being a crowd-pleaser VIDEO", "title": "Why Ellen is the perfect Oscar host", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/ellen_degeneres2.jpg", "creator": "@dpd_", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Daniel D'Addario", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Academy Awards, Billy Crystal, Editor's Picks, ellen degeneres, Oscar hosts, Oscars, Oscars 2014, Seth MacFarlane, TV, Video", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc4c0\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Academy Awards, Billy Crystal, Editor's Picks, ellen degeneres, Oscar hosts, Oscars, Oscars 2014, Seth MacFarlane, TV, Video, Entertainment NewsUp there with the vice-presidency, the job of Oscar host is one of the world\u2019s most thankless.\nThis year\u2019s host is unlikely to reprise MacFarlane\u2019s \u201cWe Saw Your Boobs\u201d number \u2014 it\u2019s Ellen DeGeneres, the amiable daytime host who last had the gig in 2007.\nBut the seven years since DeGeneres\u2019 perfectly competent gig have seen enough host-related tsuris that, finally, \u201cperfectly competent\u201d seems good enough.\nOscar hosts are usually asked back, if they\u2019re going to be, within only a couple of years, and it seemed a fair presumption that Ellen would keep dancing on daytime TV exclusively.\nShe\u2019s very good at telling jokes, but those jokes are so inclusive as to be amiably unspecific."}
