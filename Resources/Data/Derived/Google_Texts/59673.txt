Although retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson snagged a spot in the first Republican presidential debate, he didn't think he was getting much love from the Fox News moderators compared to the other heavy hitters onstage.

Carson took the second question but was not called on again for more than half an hour. When host Megyn Kelly called on him for a second question, roughly 40 minutes into the debate, Carson marked that neglect with humor.

"I wasn't sure I was going to get to talk again," he quipped, drawing laughter from the crowd.

Carson then went on to field the question on enhanced interrogation techniques, his second question focused on foreign policy and national security, seen as his weak points.

On whether he would approve of using enhanced interrogation techniques on suspected terrorists, Carson took a hawkish line.

"What we do to get the information we need is our business. I wouldn't be broadcasting to everybody what we're going to do," he said, drawing audience applause.

He added, "There is no such thing as a politically correct war."

"We want to utilize the tremendous intellect we have in the military to win wars," he said. "If we gave them the mission ... they would be able to carry it out."
