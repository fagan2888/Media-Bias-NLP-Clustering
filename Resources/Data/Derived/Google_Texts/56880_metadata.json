The American people are standing up to protect Social Security and Medicare. A Sen. Sanders (I-VT) led coalition is flexing its muscle with a petition drive that has collected almost 500,000 signatures already.\n\nIn a statement, Sen. Sanders said, \u201cThe success of this petition drive makes it very clear to me that the American people want deficit reduction to be done in a way that is fair and not by cutting programs such as Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. At a time when the number of people living in poverty in our country is at an all-time high, we must not cut programs which provide basic security to tens of millions of our people who are struggling economically.\u201d\n\nTo put into context how successful this petition drive has been, it took months and a national television advertising campaign for Ted Cruz\u2019s defund Obamacare petition to get to 2 million signatures.\n\nBernie Sanders and a coalition of groups that includes CREDO, Daily Kos, Campaign for America\u2019s Future, Social Security Works, Democracy for America, Progressives United, MoveOn, Other98, USAction and the Alliance for Retired Americans have gotten to a nearly a quarter of Cruz\u2019s total number of signatures in about 1/10th of the time.\n\nThe movement that Bernie Sanders is leading won\u2019t be spending millions of dollars on television ads. They don\u2019t have shadowy billionaires writing big checks in the background. What Bernie Sanders and the left have is popular support on the issues. They don\u2019t have to buy their support. They are a real people\u2019s movement.\n\nTed Cruz and the tea party are Astro-Turf. They are a \u201cmovement\u201d which has been designed to raise money, and carry out the agenda of a few billionaires and special interests. They don\u2019t have popular support for their positions on the issues, so they have spend millions of dollars constructing illusions of strength.\n\nThe left\u2019s grassroots are strong and well organized. The grassroots left has had success in recent years with various protests, boycotts, and petitions. If the media really wanted to know what is going on at the grassroots level in this country, they would ignore Cruz and the tea party and spend their time talking to Sanders and the left.\n\nThe reality is that what took Ted Cruz and his allies millions of dollars and months to accomplish, Bernie Sanders and the left have a chance of accomplishing in three more weeks. Nothing would make the point about protecting Social Security and Medicare clearer than blowing Ted Cruz\u2019s defund Obamacare petition out of the water. In order for that to happen, people have to keep sharing and signing the petition. (You can sign a MoveOn version of the petition here.)\n\nThis is about making Congress and the president pay attention to your voice. Social Security and Medicare are beloved programs, and you can save them from getting caught up in Washington budget hysteria.
