A man was struck and killed early Saturday while he was walking on the highway after his car broke down in Arlington, police said.

The man, who has not been identified, was struck by a pickup truck shortly after 12 a.m. on U.S. 287 near Turner Warnell Road. He was walking on one of the southbound highway lanes when he was hit, police said. It appeared that his vehicle broke down about a quarter mile away from where he was hit, police said.

The truck driver stopped after hitting the man and called 911. Police said he is unlikely to face criminal charges for the incident.
