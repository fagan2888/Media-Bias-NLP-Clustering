A national transportation research group says Connecticut’s deteriorating roads are costing state drivers more than $4 billion a year.

TRIP evaluates the conditions of roads and bridges around the country.

TRIP’s Rocky Moretti said their new report finds deficient roadways in Connecticut costing state drivers on average nearly $2,000 a year. "This is the cost of driving on rough roads that beats up your vehicle," he said, "[and] the value of the time lost stuck in traffic, because of traffic congestion, and the economic cost of serious and fatal crashes."

Moretti said that more than half the roads between Stamford and Bridgeport are in poor condition.

TRIP is sponsored by insurance companies, smart growth advocates, businesses, and unions involved in the repair of infrastructure. Their report, called Connecticut Transportation by the Numbers, also found that more than a third of Connecticut’s bridges are structurally deficient.
