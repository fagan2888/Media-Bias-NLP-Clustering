But what if employees don't want to?\n\nOne can trace the United Auto Workers's defeat in Chattanooga last month to a factory in Elkhart, Indiana. Two decades ago, employees at Electromation Inc.\u2019s Elkhart plant opposed plans to change their attendance bonuses. Surprised, Electromation formed joint worker-management \u201caction committees\u201d to solve workplace problems. The company committed to implementing committee solutions that did not cost too much. This gave workers a meaningful voice on the job while management fixed problems it didn\u2019t know it had. Everyone was happy\u2014except the government. The National Labor Relations Board stepped in and disbanded the committees. The National Labor Relations Act prohibits companies from \u201cdominat[ing] or interfer[ing] with the formation or administration of any labor organization.\u201d Congress wanted to prevent businesses from setting up fake \u201ccompany unions\u201d to fend off organizing drives. But that broad prohibition also proscribed Electromation\u2019s action committees. In fact, it prohibits almost any formal employee voice on the job outside of collective bargaining with a union.\n\nThe law gives workers an all-or-nothing choice. If they want a formal voice with management, they need to unionize. Otherwise, they must remain silent. The government will shut down other non-union forms of employee representation. This no longer makes sense. Employers have little reason to create fake unions today\u2014few feel they need them to fend off organizing drives. Union membership has dropped below 7 percent in the private sector. Employers have little reason to create fake unions today\u2014few feel they need them to fend off organizing drives. Union membership has dropped below 7 percent in the private sector. But many companies do want to hear their employees\u2019 concerns. Rank-and-file workers know things that senior management does not. And businesses want to attract and retain quality employees. The entire \u201chuman resource\u201d philosophy emphasizes the fact that workers are a company\u2019s most valuable asset. Most employers want to keep their employees happy if they can. Employee participation programs can improve morale and working conditions. This explains why Volkswagen\u2019s management wanted employees at their Chattanooga plant to unionize. Volkswagen has work councils in all of its German factories. With work councils, employee representatives formally discuss concerns with management representatives. They enable companies to get input and consult their workers before making changes. German work councils often help plants to operate safely and productively. Volkswagen has found its plants run better with work councils, so management wanted one in Chattanooga. Yet Volkswagen could not simply create one. As Electromation learned the hard way, that violates the NLRA. To form a works council, the workers first needed to unionize. So Volkswagen\u2019s management invited the UAW in. The company gave union organizers free run of the plant. Management held meetings\u2014on the clock\u2014for union representatives to make their pitch. The company did everything but roll out a red carpet for the UAW. Yet on election day, in the privacy of the voting booth, a majority of workers voted against unionizing.", "article_metadata": {"description": "An federal law from eight decades ago dictates that companies like Volkswagen can&#39;t create work councils unless\u00a0employees unionize.
