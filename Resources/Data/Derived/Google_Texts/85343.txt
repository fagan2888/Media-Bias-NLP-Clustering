Some Florida firefighters have headed west to fight raging forest fires and earn some extra money.

The Miami Herald reports that more than 470 Florida Fire fighters have spent part of their summer fighting fires in western states.

Tommy Price is a Valrico firefighter and president of the Florida State Fire Service Association. He just returned from fighting fires in Alaska. He says the extra money will help him get through lean times.

Price says most firefighters make a little over $20,000 each year in take-home pay.

Florida Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam oversees the state's firefighters. He pushed the Legislature to raise firefighter pay this year, but his proposal was rejected.

Putnam says the firefighters are "selfless public servants," who deserve a raise.
