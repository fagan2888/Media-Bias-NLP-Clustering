Thus, this RFI focuses on obtaining input on measures that address these aspects of interoperability for the specified populations.\n\nHowever, the division of the Department of Health & Human Services (CMS) is seeking comment on whether this limitation is sufficient.\n\nOn the subject of available data sources and potential measures, ONC touches on the information currently available for assessing interoperability nationally:\n\nnational survey data from key stakeholder organizations and federal entities CMS\u2019s Medicare and Medicaid EHR Incentive Programs data\n\n\"ONC recognizes that its currently available data sources might not be sufficient to fully measure and determine whether the goal of widespread exchange of health information through interoperable certified EHR technology has been achieved,\" the RFI reads.\n\nIn the RFI, ONC lays out several measures currently under consideration:\n\n\u2022 Proportion of health care providers who are electronically sending, receiving, finding, and easily integrating key health information, such as summary of care records. This can be a composite measure (engaging in all four aspects of interoperable exchange) or separate, individual measures. \u2022 Proportion of health care providers who use the information that they electronically receive from outside providers and sources for clinical decision-making. \u2022 Proportion of health care providers who electronically perform reconciliation of clinical information (e.g. medications).\n\nDespite its dependence on meaningful use data, ONC points out potential limitations in the information.\n\n\"One primary limitation is that differences exist in how CMS currently receives performance data from each of the Medicare and Medicaid EHR Incentive Programs,\" the document states. \"Currently, Medicare collects and reports on performance data for each individual eligible professional, eligible hospital, and CAH. However, performance data is not available for each individual Medicaid eligible professional, eligible hospital, or CAH as the Medicaid EHR Incentive Program is operated by the states.\"\n\nThose limitations aside, ONC is considering the following measures based on meaningful use data:\n\n\u2022 Proportion of transitions of care or referrals where a summary of care record was created using certified EHR technology and exchanged or transmitted electronically. \u2022 For 2017 and subsequent years, the proportion of transitions or referrals and patient encounters in which the health care provider is the recipient of a transition or referral or has never before encountered the patient, and where the health care provider (e.g., eligible professional, eligible hospital, or CAH) receives, requests or queries for an electronic summary of care document to incorporate into the patient's record. \u2022 Proportion of transitions of care where medication reconciliation is performed. \u2022 For 2017 and subsequent years, the proportion of transitions or referrals received and patient encounters in which the health care provider is the recipient of a transition or referral or has never before encountered the patient, and the health care provider performs clinical information reconciliation for medications, medication allergies, and problem lists.\n\nAs for other data sources for measuring interoperability, the federal agency is considering Medicare Fee-For-Service (FFS) claims data as well as electronically-generated data from CEHRT and other health IT systems for exchanging health information.\n\n\"ONC recognizes this will require collaboration and coordination with federal entities and stakeholders across the ecosystem including entities that enable exchange and interoperable health information use, such as technology developers, Health Information Organizations (HIOs) and Health Information Service Providers (HISPs),\" ONC states.\n\nComments are due by close of business on June 3, 2016.", "article_metadata": {"description": "ONC seeks comment on interoperability metrics for MACRA largely based on meaningful use data.", "author": "EHRIntelligence", "og": {"url": "https://ehrintelligence.com/news/onc-seeks-input-on-measuring-interoperability-under-macra", "site_name": "EHRIntelligence", "image": "https://ehrintelligence.com/images/site/articles/2015-09-03-onc-star.png", "type": "article", "title": "ONC Seeks Input on Measuring Interoperability under MACRA"}, "twitter": {"description": "ONC seeks comment on interoperability metrics for MACRA largely based on meaningful use data.", "creator": "@", "image": {"src": "https://ehrintelligence.com/images/site/articles/2015-09-03-onc-star.png"}, "title": "ONC Seeks Input on Measuring Interoperability under MACRA", "site": "@", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "msvalidate.01": "A4BC83422766F1B550D1E340B290BAC0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "\"ONC recognizes this will require collaboration and coordination with federal entities and stakeholders across the ecosystem including entities that enable exchange and interoperable health information use, such as technology developers, Health Information Organizations (HIOs) and Health Information Service Providers (HISPs),\" ONC states.\n\"The Secretary of HHS will delegate authority to carry out the provisions of section 106(b)(1) of the MACRA to the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC),\" the RFI states.\"\n\u2022 Proportion of health care providers who use the information that they electronically receive from outside providers and sources for clinical decision-making.\nDespite its dependence on meaningful use data, ONC points out potential limitations in the information.\nAs for other data sources for measuring interoperability, the federal agency is considering Medicare Fee-For-Service (FFS) claims data as well as electronically-generated data from CEHRT and other health IT systems for exchanging health information."}
