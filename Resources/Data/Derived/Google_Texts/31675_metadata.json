(AP) - Thomas Ravenel wants to talk about ideas in his independent run for U.S. Senate. But his felony drug conviction sometimes gets in the way.\n\nRavenel is serious about this run. In the months since he presented his 16,500 signatures to get on the November ballot, Ravenel has met voters at Irmo\u2019s Okra Strut and Beaufort\u2019s Water Festival. He\u2019s given speeches at a gay pride parade in Columbia and to tea party groups in Laurens, Sumter and elsewhere.\n\nThe television crew taping the second season of his reality show \u201cSouthern Charm\u201d doesn\u2019t follow him all the time. At a recent event it was just Ravenel and his campaign manager. \u201cIt\u2019s my money, I tell them when I want them,\u201d he said of the crews, now taping the show\u2019s second season.\n\nBut his bid to take out a man he holds in contempt - Republican U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham - is stalled. A Winthrop University poll from last week had placed him at 8 percent of likely voters, with Graham at 46 percent and Democratic challenger Brad Hutto at 28 percent.\n\nRavenel recently said he is reassessing his campaign after the poll. He has spent about $300,000 so far - mostly from his own pocket. The businessman isn\u2019t sure if it is a good investment to spend a whole lot more, even if he knows millions in television advertising is his only possible path to victory.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s obviously a situation where if we can\u2019t win I\u2019m not going to waste a lot of money,\u201d Ravenel said Thursday, speaking with The Associated Press before an appearance before the West Ashley Rotary Club in Charleston. \u201cBut I want to make a good showing and get my issues out there.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a far cry from Ravenel\u2019s first Senate race in 2004, his first political race ever. The seat was open thanks to the retirement of Ernest \u201cFritz\u201d Hollings. Ravenel, a handsome and TV-savvy Republican whose star was rising, poured $3 million of his real estate developing fortune into a massive TV blitz. He was just 4,500 votes shy of beating Jim DeMint for second place and making a runoff that DeMint won.\n\nRavenel would become state Treasurer two years later. But then came a 2007 arrest on a cocaine charge that haunts him today. Ravenel pleaded guilty to the felony and served 10 months behind bars for buying cocaine for himself and his friends. He also pleaded guilty to driving under the influence in Long Island, New York, earlier this year and had his license suspended for six months.\n\nAfter getting out of jail on the cocaine charge, he wrote on Facebook that he no longer wanted to be an American citizen and he owed this country nothing because it destroyed his reputation, confiscated his wealth and took his freedom. Ravenel later said that was satire.\n\nThen he became the star of a reality TV show \u201cSouthern Charm,\u201d where there was plenty of drinking and debauchery. He got a co-star less than half his age pregnant. Ravenel, 52, has moved in with her and is helping to raise their infant daughter.\n\nAt the Rotary Club meeting, Ravenel spoke about his ideas of limited government and personal liberties, linking Graham and New Deal policies to U.S. problems today. He opened the floor to questions. The first person asked about term limits. The second said he was going to address the elephant in the room. Ravenel let out a sigh and took a drink of water as he was asked why anyone who voted for him before all his problems should vote for him again.\n\n\u201cMy personal life has been my Achilles heel,\u201d Ravenel said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve been very strong in business I think I\u2019m right on the issues. Like Meatloaf said in that song in the 70s - two out of three ain\u2019t bad.\u201d\n\nIt didn\u2019t satisfy the crowd, which kept asking questions and pointing out Ravenel\u2019s private problems could become public problems again if he\u2019s elected. Ravenel insisted he had learned his lesson.\n\nRavenel could barely hold in his disdain for Graham, calling him a \u201cwhore for military industrial complex.\u201d Ravenel said Graham\u2019s support for surveillance erodes personal liberties and the senator\u2019s love for military intervention and bipartisan politics will destroy America and that\u2019s why he decided to run.\n\nHe even said Hutto would be a better U.S. senator for solidly Republican South Carolina than Graham because when Democrats \u201cwant to grow government, take away our freedom, they need bipartisanship. Graham is the indispensable Republican.\u201d\n\nGraham dismisses Ravenel too. His campaign refuses to talk about him, referring any questions from reporters to the state Republican party. Graham debated his challengers in almost every primary and general election in his career, but turned down an invitation for a statewide televised debate on Oct. 13 that would have included Hutto and Ravenel.\n\n___\n\nFollow Jeffrey Collins on Twitter at http://twitter.com/JSCollinsAP", "article_metadata": {"description": "Thomas Ravenel wants to talk about ideas in his independent run for U.S. Senate.
