In just showing the successes, a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 \u2014 or CV \u2014 actually reflects only a tiny slice of one's experience \u2014 and perhaps not even the most important part.\n\nThat's the idea behind a recent \"CV of failures,\" published by Johannes Haushofer, a professor who teaches psychology and public affairs at Princeton. Haushofer's CV of failures, which he published online for all to see, includes degree programs he didn't get into, research funding he didn't receive and paper rejections from academic journals.\n\n\"Most of what I try fails, but these failures are often invisible, while the successes are visible,\" Haushofer writes. \"I have noticed that this sometimes gives others the impression that most things work out for me. As a result, they are more likely to attribute their own failures to themselves, rather than the fact that the world is stochastic, applications are crapshoots, and selection committees and referees have bad days.\"\n\nThe original idea for a CV of failures comes from an article published in the journal Nature, which argued that creating a visible record of failures is a powerful way to help other people deal with their own shortcomings. Whereas we're intimately familiar with both our professional successes and our failures, other people just see a string of accomplishments \u2014 and that can be discouraging.\n\nMany famous business people, including Henry Ford and W.H. Macy, went broke repeatedly before hitting it big. And it seems as though almost every famous writer or musician was rejected dozens of times before achieving success. The real tragedy isn't these failures \u2014 it's when these failures convince people to stop trying.\n\nAna Swanson, Washington Post\n\nIn an oral history in 2002 with NASA, the late Sally Ride, who became the first American woman in space in 1983, recounted some of the confusion her gender caused the male-dominated engineering corps a generation ago. Here she explains.\n\nThe engineers at NASA, in their infinite wisdom, decided that women astronauts would want makeup \u2014 so they designed a makeup kit. A makeup kit brought to you by NASA engineers. (Laughter) So, \"What?\" You can just imagine the discussions amongst the predominantly male engineers about what should go in a makeup kit. So they came to me, figuring that I could give them advice. It was about the last thing in the world that I wanted to be spending my time in training on. So I didn't spend much time on it at all.\n\nBut there were a couple of other female astronauts, who were given the job of determining what should go in the makeup kit, and how many tampons should fly as part of a flight kit. I remember the engineers trying to decide how many tampons should fly on a one-week flight; they asked, \"Is 100 the right number?\" \"No. That would not be the right number.\" They said, \"Well, we want to be safe.\" I said, \"Well, you can cut that in half with no problem at all.\" (She laughs.)\n\nAnd there were probably some other, similar sorts of issues, just because they had never thought about what just kind of personal equipment a female astronaut would take. They knew that a man might want a shaving kit, but they didn't know what a woman would carry. Most of these were male engineers, so this was totally new and different to them.\n\nPresident Barack Obama's health-care reform law made government health insurance available to more people living in poverty or near poverty by expanding Medicaid. The hope was to improve people's physical health, but new research shows an important effect on financial health: The law has helped many poor Americans pay off the collection agent.\n\nThe analysis, conducted by a team of university researchers and members of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, estimates that those who signed up for Medicaid under the law reduced their collection balances by $600 to $1,000 each.\n\nThe financial benefits of Obamacare for the poor are an \"underappreciated\" aspect of the law, said economist Robert Kaestner of the University of Illinois at Chicago, who is one of the authors of the new study. \"Health insurance, like any type of insurance, is first and foremost a form of financial protection,\" he said. \"It is a real benefit.\"\n\nKaestner, working with colleagues at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and the University of Michigan, showed that people who benefited from the expansion used the money they saved on health care to pay down their other debts.\n\nMax Ehrenfreund, Washington Post\n\nGlobal warming has mostly made the weather more pleasant for Americans over the last 40 years, which may explain why much of the public doesn't rank climate change as big a threat as do scientists and the rest of the world, a new study suggests. But that perceived benefit of global warming \u2014 mostly milder winters \u2014 will soon be outweighed by more oppressive summer heat, according to a study in the journal Nature that's dividing the scientific community.\n\n\"Americans are getting the wrong signal from year-round weather about whether they should be concerned about climate change,\" said study lead author Patrick Egan, a public policy professor at New York University. \"They're getting the good parts and haven't had to pay the price of the bad part.\"\n\nAt least, not yet. If heat-trapping gases aren't controlled, nearly nine out of 10 Americans will have noticeably worse weather \u2014 not better \u2014 by the end of the century, especially in the summer, the study found.\n\nSeth Borenstein, Associated Press\n\nThe water in your glass might be older than the sun. It's a mystery how the world became awash in it. But one clue to the riddle may be found in \"heavy water\" containing hydrogen's chunky twin, deuterium, which contains a neutron in its nucleus. Deuterium-rich water may have formed in an interstellar \"cloud\" billions of years ago, scientists say, before our sun was set ablaze more than 4.6 billion years ago. That may be the origin of as much as half of all the water on Earth, which means the same liquid we drink and that fills the oceans may be millions of years older than the solar system itself. A recent paper showed that these ice molecules could have survived the solar system's violent beginnings, eventually to be deposited on Earth, the moon, comets \u2014 even in your water bottle.\n\nNicholas St. Fleur, New York Times\n\n\n\nIf you could read between the lines of the many successes that are recorded in a r\u00e9sum\u00e9, you would probably see far more failures: schools people didn't get into; scholarship essays that were toiled over and rejected; job applications that now seem harebrained.
