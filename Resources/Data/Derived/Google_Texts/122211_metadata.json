A large gaggle of stressed, frustrated journalists. Awkward teenage boys in the Beltway uniform of triple-pleated khakis, oversize blue blazers, and unusually wide ties.\n\nBut with all the people and conversations and exhibitions and presentations\u2014which ran the gamut of conservative concerns and characters\u2014there was one thing missing: a meaningful effort at minority outreach.\n\nI add \u201cmeaningful\u201d because there was something of an effort at trying to address the Republican Party\u2019s problem with race. To wit, the main attraction for Thursday afternoon was a panel on outreach to \u201cnontraditional voting blocs,\u201d featuring Ed Gillespie, the former RNC head turned Senate candidate in Virginia, and two black conservatives: Robert Woodson, president of the Center for Neighborhood Enterprise, and Elroy Sailor, a close partner of former Rep. J.C. Watts.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a bad lineup. But there were two big problems. First, no one cared. The event\u2014held on the main stage of the conference\u2014was nearly empty. The CPAC crowd, it seemed, had better things to do than think about its relationship with black and brown Americans.\n\nAnd second? Judging from the description, the panel was designed for disappointment. Billed as a discussion on \u201chow to bring conservative ideas of liberty, opportunity, and prosperity to nontraditional voting blocs and teach party and movement leaders how to embrace them,\u201d the hourlong panel was a rote restatement of the GOP boilerplate on outreach.\n\nFor instance, when moderator Jason Roe, a Revolvis Consulting partner, asked whether, to \u201cdo better with minority voters,\u201d Republicans should \u201cmoderate our policies\u201d or \u201crenew our commitment to communicating how our policies will help,\u201d no one jumped at the former approach. Instead, the panel focused on the latter, as if blacks and Latinos have never heard the supply-side gospel of Saint Reagan, or the Good News of \u201cindividual responsibility\u201d and personal \u201cuplift.\u201d\n\nTo his credit, Woodson pushed Republicans to go into communities and provide funds and services for talented young people, so they can live up to their potential. In general, however, the panelists had nothing new or novel to say.\n\n\u201cThe Democrats, using nonprofits and going into these communities, have lots of goodies,\u201d explained Roe, echoing Mitt Romney\u2019s comments to supporters after the 2012 election. \u201cAnd our guys aren\u2019t exactly in the offering-goodies business. So it\u2019s harder for us to go in and do the same kind of thing.\u201d \u201cAbortion has been worse on the African-American community than the slave trade or Jim Crow,\u201d said Sailor, entering the fray with a tired piece of conservative dogma.\n\nIf this were just one piece in a wide array of outreach efforts at CPAC, it wouldn\u2019t weigh as much on my impressions. But, if you were to look around at the conference in toto, you would (correctly) assume a conservative world that, at best, is indifferent to winning minority voters. The exhibition hall, for example, was filled with booths devoted to the problems of debt, comparing it to\u2014among other things\u2014a brutal jungle war (complete with a trio of camouflage-clad athletic twentysomethings).\n\nBy contrast, you had to hunt for the two booths devoted to some form of minority outreach. One was manned by Dwayne Carson, a young-ish advocate who runs the Center for American Racial Equality, and who\u2014from a distance and up close\u2014looks like the Ben Reilly to Cory Booker\u2019s Peter Parker. As Carson enthusiastically tells it, CARE exists to spread the message of \u201cfree markets and economic opportunity\u201d to minority communities. Which is to say, it\u2019s the same kind of outreach pushed by most conservatives. The problem is that this kind of \u201copportunity\u201d is hard to find in places where jobs are nonexistent; why open a grocery store when no one can afford to shop there? \u201cThe jobs are out there,\u201d Carson explained, \u201cLook at taking a trade. There\u2019s nothing wrong with being a plumber.\u201d\n\nThere was another booth with another Carson\u2014Dr. Ben Carson, who has emerged as a Great Black Hope for conservatives who want to win black voters. The \u201cDraft Carson\u201d campaign is run by Vernon Robinson, a former city councilman from North Carolina who thinks the widely lauded physician could pull huge numbers of black voters from Democrats in a national election. We spoke about his effort, after he paused to take a few pictures with a man in a Darth Vader costume. \u201cDr. Carson was a legend for a generation of black parents who wanted their children to be like him,\u201d said Robinson, \u201cHe is the only candidate who can get 17 percent of the black vote and beat Hillary Clinton.\u201d\n\nBeyond that, explained Robinson, Carson was able to \u201ccalmly articulate conservative principles.\u201d The problem with GOP outreach to minorities wasn\u2019t that the product was bad, he said, echoing every other conservative speaker on the subject; the problem is that the \u201cRepublican brand has been destroyed\u201d and that black voters rely on Democrats to know what the GOP \u201cstands for.\u201d In short, they\u2019ve been fooled.\n\nWe condemn Allen West for attacking black voters as \u201cslaves\u201d on the \u201cDemocratic plantation,\u201d but that\u2019s just a superheated version of the GOP\u2019s argument on minority outreach. Republicans don\u2019t need to change their policies or their approach\u2014they just need to talk louder to voters who just don\u2019t understand that the Republican Party is good for them.\n\nBut this is nonsense. As one attendee\u2014a black graduate student at Regent University\u2014said to me, \u201cThe GOP needs to rethink what it\u2019s selling. For people who believe in free markets, they should see that the public doesn\u2019t want what they have to offer. [With black voters], Republicans need to speak to real and legitimate concerns.\u201d\n\nI should say that there are a few conservatives\u2014in the libertarian wing of the GOP\u2014who are beginning to do just that. In the back of the exhibition hall were two booths: One for Right on Crime and the other for Families Against Mandatory Minimums. Both were there to \u201cbring the message of criminal-justice reform to conservatives,\u201d and both agreed that this was an area where coalitions between racial and ideological groups were possible.\n\nThat is, if the Republican Party can cure itself of its worst racial impulses, which go beyond condescending language into outright race baiting. Indeed, the last month saw a relentless, Willie Horton-style campaign against Debo Adegbile, President Obama\u2019s nominee to lead the civil-rights division in the Justice Department. On conservative blogs, in conservative media, and at CPAC, Adegbile\u2014an African American\u2014was condemned as a \u201ccop killer\u201d for defending the right to a fair trial for Mumia Abu-Jamal. And that\u2019s on top of the regular attacks on civil-rights law from the GOP, which sees anti-racism as worse than actual discrimination against minorities.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "@jbouie"}, "keywords": "u.s. poli", "publicationDate": 201403072048, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "description": "For all the urgency in the 2012 post-mortem\u2019s directive to reach out to minority voters, the GOP\u2019s vanguard still isn\u2019t offering them anything new\u2014not that anyone\u2019s listening anyway.", "pageNum": 1, "title": "At CPAC, Slim Pickings in Minority Outreach", "tags": "topic:politics", "environment": "dev", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "type": "house", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"At CPAC, Slim Pickings in \u2018Minority Outreach\u2019 \",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/03/07/at-cpac-slim-pickings-in-minority-outreach.html\",\"image_url\":\"http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/03/07/at-cpac-slim-pickings-in-minority-outreach/jcr:content/image.crop.410.273.jpg/46474214.cached.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/03/07/at-cpac-slim-pickings-in-minority-outreach\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-03-07T20:48:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"Politics\",\"author\":\"Jamelle Bouie\",\"tags\":[\"politics\"]}", "news_keywords": "US Politics", "sectionTaxanomies": "politics", "fb": {"admins": "1703087,30000737,1117577220,1276800108,931159,514915512", "app_id": 189930913679}, "authors": "Jamelle Bouie", "article": {"section": "politics", "published_time": "2014-03-07T20:48:00.000Z", "author": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/jamelle-bouiehtml"}, "resourceType": "dailybeast2/components/pages/article", "contentpath": "/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/03/07/at-cpac-slim-pickings-in-minority-outreach", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "For all the urgency in the 2012 post-mortem\u2019s directive to reach out to minority voters, the GOP\u2019s vanguard still isn\u2019t offering them anything new\u2014not that anyone\u2019s listening anyway.", "title": "At CPAC, Slim Pickings in \u2018Minority Outreach\u2019", "url": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/03/07/at-cpac-slim-pickings-in-minority-outreach.html", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/03/07/at-cpac-slim-pickings-in-minority-outreach/jcr:content/image.img.2000.jpg/1394226441651.cached.jpg", "type": "article"}, "authorIds": "/etc/authors/j/jamelle-bouie", "content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfa9c\"", "article_summary": "By contrast, you had to hunt for the two booths devoted to some form of minority outreach.\nWe condemn Allen West for attacking black voters as \u201cslaves\u201d on the \u201cDemocratic plantation,\u201d but that\u2019s just a superheated version of the GOP\u2019s argument on minority outreach.\nBut with all the people and conversations and exhibitions and presentations\u2014which ran the gamut of conservative concerns and characters\u2014there was one thing missing: a meaningful effort at minority outreach.\nSame Old SongFor all the urgency in the 2012 post-mortem\u2019s directive to reach out to minority voters, the GOP\u2019s vanguard still isn\u2019t offering them anything new\u2014not that anyone\u2019s listening anyway.\nBen Carson, who has emerged as a Great Black Hope for conservatives who want to win black voters."}
