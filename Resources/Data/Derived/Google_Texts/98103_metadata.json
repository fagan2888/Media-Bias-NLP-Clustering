United States, a case that my colleague Elizabeth Wydra has described as \u201ca constitutional dispute wrapped in a sad soap opera\u201d \u2013 with an extramarital affair, a child born out of wedlock, and a spurned spouse seeking revenge.\n\nAfter placing toxic chemicals on various surfaces on or around the home of her husband\u2019s mistress, Carol Anne Bond was prosecuted and convicted under a federal law passed to implement an international chemical weapons treaty. Ms. Bond\u2019s case is scheduled for argument before the Supreme Court tomorrow, with her side being pressed by conservative super-lawyer Paul Clement.\n\nColorful facts aside, in the conservatives\u2019 rendering of Bond, the very fabric of the Republic is at stake. George Will has called it the Term\u2019s \u201cmost momentous case,\u201d arguing that the Roberts Court must step in to check a \u201cgovernment run amok.\u201d The Heritage Foundation warns that the case challenges a key lesson that \u201cAmericans are taught from a young age\u201d \u2013 that \u201cour government is a government of limited powers.\u201d And Ted Cruz frames the legal issue as follows: whether the \u201cTreaty Clause is a trump card that defeats all of the remaining structural limitations on the federal government.\u201d A scary proposition, indeed . . .\n\nBut will the Court even get this far? Ms. Bond\u2019s primary argument is that the chemical weapons treaty and its implementing statute should be read to exclude her conduct \u2013 a question of statutory interpretation and hardly the stuff of Tenthers\u2019 dreams. If the Court decides the case on those grounds, Ms. Bond could very well prevail, while the ruling itself could be rather minor. The main reason that this case may prove \u201cmomentous\u201d is that leading conservative academics, advocates, and legal groups are pushing the Roberts Court to turn this case from an interesting-but-far-from-historic statutory case into a monumental constitutional one.\n\nRelated Stories: Seeking a middle ground in Bond v.

United States\n\nWhile the Court denied a request from Professor Nicholas Rosenkranz and the Cato Institute \u2013 the main proponents of the treaty-power-as-dangerous-trump-card theory \u2013 for time to press their argument during tomorrow\u2019s hearing, the Court generally rejects such requests from amicus curiae, so we can\u2019t read too much into that. And, following other recent cases addressing the scope of federal power \u2013 including, most prominently, the Affordable Care Act case \u2013 there is every reason to believe that the Court may wade into the important constitutional issues lurking just beneath the surface in Bond.\n\nThe primary constitutional issue in the case involves the scope of the federal government\u2019s treaty power \u2013 a power that was of central interest to George Washington and his Founding-era colleagues \u2013 and, in turn, Congress\u2019s power under the Necessary and Proper Clause to pass laws to implement validly enacted treaties. However, in Bond, conservative legal groups have proceeded to turn the Constitution\u2019s text and history on their head, arguing that the Constitution itself requires a ruling that sharply limits federal power and overturns nearly a century\u2019s worth of precedent \u2013 dating back to a 1920 ruling by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes. Indeed, Bond is just one of several cases this Term featuring an aggressive call by conservatives to overturn well-established precedent. Furthermore, a broad ruling by the Court\u2019s conservatives could significantly limit Congress\u2019s power to enact laws under the Necessary and Proper Clause, generally, opening up new challenges to various government programs and regulations.\n\nIn the past, the right\u2019s constitutional arguments may have gone unanswered. However, increasingly, leading progressive academics and practitioners have begun to stake their own claim to the Constitution\u2019s text and history \u2013 the tired battle between the progressive community\u2019s \u201cliving Constitution\u201d and Justice Scalia\u2019s \u201cdead Constitution\u201d replaced by new battles between the left and the right over the Constitution\u2019s meaning. Bond is a clear example of this new dynamic.\n\nRather than ceding the Constitution\u2019s text and history to conservative legal groups, progressives have fought back in Bond with originalist arguments of their own in briefs authored by some of the progressive community\u2019s leading lights, including Walter Dellinger, Marty Lederman, and Oona Hathaway. These briefs \u2013 as well as one filed by my organization, Constitutional Accountability Center \u2013 remind the Court that, in ditching the dysfunctional Articles of Confederation, the Founders sought to create a strong national government with the power to negotiate treaties with foreign nations, pass laws to fulfill those treaty obligations, and, in turn, enhance the young nation\u2019s international reputation.\n\nWith progressives fully engaged in the battle over the Constitution\u2019s meaning, the question facing the Court in important constitutional cases is now less about whether the Constitution\u2019s text and history should prevail and more about which side\u2019s version rings truer.\n\nTom Donnelly is the Constitutional Accountability Center\u2019s Message Director and Counsel.
