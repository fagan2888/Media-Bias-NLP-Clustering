I didn't think to load my gun. It's loaded now.\"\n\nShe witnessed the murder and even fell victim to the violence. The intruders punched her, knocked her to the ground and stole her wallet.\n\nDovie believes the men shot and killed her grandson and beat her up out of revenge for St. Clair.\n\n\"It is kind of upsetting to know she has gone free, when she is the one that started the whole mess,\" Dovie said.\n\n3/29/2014 Related Story: Family Of Norman Murder Victim Speaks Out\n\nCleveland County prosecutors dismissed the murder charge against St. Clair, Thursday, due to insufficient evidence.\n\nOne of the state's key witnesses, Jason Harris, refused to testify against St.Clair in her preliminary hearing, despite the plea agreement he previously made with prosecutors.\n\nHarris pled guilty to murder, burglary and robbery and is serving 25 years of a life sentence in exchange for his testimony.\n\nNo word on what will happen with Harris' case given the change.\n\nMeanwhile, St. Clair has been released from the Cleveland County Detention Center.\n\n\"She was thrilled,\" St. Clair's attorney Dan Murdock said.\n\nMurdock said the couple had a contentious relationship, but St. Clair has always maintained her innocence.\n\n3/27/2014 Related Story: Norman Man Dies After Being Shot During Home Invasion\n\n\"She was not involved in it and did not have anything to do with it,\" Murdock added.\n\nDovie is still hopeful investigators will find a way to bring charges against St. Clair again in the future.\n\nUntil then, she is keeping an eye out.\n\n\"I'm not frightened anymore,\" said Dovie. \"I got my gun loaded, and it will go eight times (laughs).
