Another way of looking at it is that the entire economy grew at one thousandth \u2014 not much to cheer about for voters paying higher taxes than they did when he arrived in office.\n\nThursday's numbers suggest yet again that Obama will end eight years in office without presiding over a thriving economy of the sort America enjoyed in the past. It also suggests that even the mediocre growth of recent years depended on high oil prices, which have collapsed by more than half.\n\nThis is the bitter fruit of creationist economics, the erroneous belief that government activity can somehow conjure new wealth and value.\n\nObama clings to the belief he brought with him into office, that he can legislate and regulate economic activity into existence. He promoted and signed a much-touted stimulus law that gave taxpayers' money to items on a Democratic wish list and to well-connected businesses, while doling out microscopic tax refunds to some workers. Beyond that, Obama's economic policy has consisted of imposing greater burdens on business in the form of labor rulings, environmental regulations, and mandates that increase the cost of job creation.\n\nHigher minimum wages, new mandatory health costs, obligatory paid leave, and new powers for corrupt labor unions all hamper economic growth. For workers to get a larger piece of pie, the pie must grow. And right now, it is growing by only five thousandths per year.\n\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Clinton email scandal gets super boring codename from State Dept. The State Department gave two public briefings this week on Hillary Clinton's email scandal, and then did as much as it could to downplay the discussion in the transcripts of those briefings. The email scandal exploded Tuesday, when the State Department's Office of Inspector General released a report saying Clinton failed to ask permission to use a private email when she led the department. It also said permission would have been denied even if she asked. Reporters asked dozens of questions about the IG report at the State Department's Wednesday and Thursday briefings. But finding those discussions is a bit of a chore, as the index to each briefing makes no mention of \"Clinton\" or \"email\" or \"scandal,\" and doesn't use", "article_metadata": {"description": "When President Obama was asked recently what he wants to be remembered for, he quickly answered that it would be as the savior of the American and global economies.\nThere are things I'm proud of, he said, citing Obamacare, then added, Saving the world economy from a Great Depression, that was pretty good.\nThe economy was in free fall when he took office, and he's been boasting for seven years that it isn't any more.
