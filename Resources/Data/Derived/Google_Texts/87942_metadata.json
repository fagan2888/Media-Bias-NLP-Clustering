(AP) \u2014 Donald Trump insults and exaggerates.\n\nHe dismisses the need for public policy ideas, gets confused about world affairs and sometimes says things that flat-out aren\u2019t true.\n\nAnd the cheers from his supporters only grow louder.\n\nBy the standard that voters typically use to judge presidential candidates, Trump probably should not have survived his first day in the 2016 race.\n\nYet as the summer draws to a close and the initial votes in the nominating calendar appear on the horizon, Trump has established himself as the Republican front-runner.\n\nListen to these voters:\n\n-\u201cIt\u2019s totally refreshing. He\u2019s not politically correct. He has a backbone and he cannot be bought,\u201d said Leigh Ann Crouse, 55, of Dubuque, Iowa.\n\n-\u201cThis country needs a businessman just like him to put us back on track, to make us stop being the laughing stock of this world,\u201d said Ken Brand, 56, of Derry, New Hampshire.\n\n-\u201cHe says everything that I would like to say, but I\u2019m afraid to say. What comes out of his mouth is not what he thinks I want to hear,\u201d said Janet Boyden, 67, of Chester, Massachusetts.\n\nThey are among the dozens of voters interviewed in the past two weeks by The Associated Press to understand how Trump has defied the laws of political gravity.\n\nUniting them is a deep-rooted anger and frustration with the nation\u2019s political leaders \u2013 President Barack Obama as well as conservative Republicans who, these voters say, haven\u2019t sufficiently stood up to his Democratic administration.\n\nSome haven\u2019t voted in years, or ever, and may not next year. But at this moment, they are entranced by Trump\u2019s combination of utter self-assurance, record of business success and a promise that his bank account is big enough to remain insulated from the forces they believe have poisoned Washington.\n\nBy the way, they say it\u2019s not that they are willing to look past Trump\u2019s flaws to fix what they believe ills the country. It\u2019s that those flaws are exactly what makes him the leader America needs.\n\n\u201cAt least we know where he stands,\u201d said Kurt Esche, 49, an independent who was at Trump\u2019s recent rally outside Boston. \u201cThese other guys, I don\u2019t trust anything that comes out of their mouths. They\u2019re lying to get elected. This guy\u2019s at least saying what he believes.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe may have started as a joke,\u201d Esche said, \u201cbut he may be the real deal.\u201d\n\n\u2014\n\nCrouse is a merchandise processor at a retail distributor outside Dubuque, the Mississippi River town where Trump tossed Univision anchor Jorge Ramos from a news conference.\n\nA political independent who has never participated in Iowa\u2019s leadoff presidential caucuses, Crouse said she began following Trump from the moment he referred to Mexican immigrants as criminals during his campaign kickoff.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just attracting people who are frustrated, and as you can see, there are a lot of us,\u201d she said.\n\nIllegal immigration is the perfect summation of Trump\u2019s unorthodox campaign.\n\nHe claims it\u2019s an issue the GOP would not be discussing if not for his presence in the race, even though the topic has been at the center of political debate for years.\n\nIt\u2019s the only one on which he has made a concrete proposal; his rivals, by comparison, have rolled out lots of ideas on a range of issues.\n\nHere\u2019s Trump\u2019s pitch: deport millions of people who are living in the United States illegally and build a border wall. Critics deride this approach as na\u00efve, but his supporters say it\u2019s the obvious solution.\n\n\u201cAs crazy as it might be, I think he\u2019s addressing something that needs to be heard,\u201d said Randy Thomas, 40, of Bedford, New Hampshire. \u201cI think he\u2019s saying something that everybody thinks always has to be addressed. If you have a country of laws, you have to abide by the laws.\u201d\n\nRepublican pollster Frank Luntz, who recently held a discussion with a group of nearly 30 Trump backers in Virginia, said such support is emblematic of Trump\u2019s popularity. It stems less from their love for the candidate and more from a belief those in power have failed.\n\n\u201cHe activates the anger and frustration they have toward Washington and Wall Street,\u201d Luntz said.\n\n\u2014\n\nFor many, Trump\u2019s rise is a reaction to Obama, long criticized by opponents as a weak leader who appeases America\u2019s enemies rather than asserting U.S. dominance on the global stage.\n\nThe voters interviewed by AP said much of Trump\u2019s appeal stems from their belief he is a decisive and forceful leader who never backs down or apologizes, even when maybe he should.\n\nMany appear convinced that the sheer force of Trump\u2019s personality can reverse decades of global realignment, and that his pledges to rid the country of people living in the U.S. illegally and penalize imported goods will restore manufacturing jobs lost to China and boost an economy still scarred by the recession.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just so weak. We\u2019re not respected anymore,\u201d said Jerry Welshoff, 56, of Franklin, Massachusetts. He arrived at a recent Trump event near Boston unsure about the candidate; he emerged sold on the candidate.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve appeased everything. We can\u2019t negotiate. I would want Donald Trump to sit across a table from (Russian President Vladimir) Putin or Iran or the Mexican prime minister to cut a deal because he\u2019s done it his whole life,\u201d he said.\n\nThe frustration among voters isn\u2019t limited to their feelings about Obama.\n\nWelshoff said the Republican Party has done nothing but acquiesce to Obama despite taking control of Congress in 2014.\n\nIt\u2019s the same complaint heard from Duane Ernster, 57, of Dubuque. He is disappointed by the few accomplishments of tea party candidates elected to Congress in 2010.\n\n\u201cThings just didn\u2019t happen. It just hasn\u2019t happened the way we\u2019d hoped,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe we need a warrior instead of a politician. People compare Mr. Trump to Putin. There\u2019s something to be said about the man, who takes care of the Russian people.\u201d\n\nOthers are simply blown away by Trump\u2019s wealth and his promise to pay for his campaign out of his own pocket. \u201cHe won\u2019t owe anybody,\u201d said Susan Sager, 57, of Aiken, South Carolina.\n\nThis is an important point of distinction with both Democratic front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who began the campaign viewed as the GOP front-runner due in no small part to his ability to raise huge amounts of money.\n\n\u201cRemember this. They have total control over Jeb and Hillary and everybody else that takes that money,\u201d Trump said this past week, adding: \u201cI will tell you this. Nobody\u2019s putting up millions of dollars for me. I\u2019m putting up my own money.\u201d\n\nThe argument that Trump is uncorruptible is powerful.\n\n\u201cI just think he\u2019s doing it for all the right reasons,\u201d said Nancy Adam, 60, at the rally near Boston. \u201cIt\u2019s not about the money. It\u2019s not about the political power. He\u2019s already got everything. He has nothing to lose by doing this.\u201d\n\n\u2014\n\nTrump\u2019s uncanny ability to stumble without consequence has befuddled his rivals.\n\nThe latest misstep for Trump came Thursday. After pledging only to run as a Republican, he fumbled a series of foreign policy questions from radio host Hugh Hewitt. Trump confused the Quds Force, an elite Iranian military unit, and the Kurds, an ethnic group of more than 30 million people.\n\nHe said the line of inquiry amounted to a \u201cgotcha question.\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean, you know, when you\u2019re asking me about who\u2019s running this, this this, that\u2019s not, that is not,\u201d Trump said, \u201cI will be so good at the military, your head will spin.\u201d\n\nSuch an answer would invariably be attacked as disqualifying if offered by anyone other than Trump. His rivals have yet to figure out how to challenge an unpredictable opponent who appears immune to such gaffes.\n\n\u201cHe just keeps repeating things over and over again. And you all just accept it for the truth, and it\u2019s not,\u201d Bush told reporters in New Hampshire on Thursday.\n\nIndeed, Trump\u2019s foibles often appear to make him stronger.\n\nDuring his recent discussion with Trump supporters, Luntz played several video clips of the billionaire\u2019s least flattering moments.\n\nOne was Trump\u2019s rejection of Arizona Sen. John McCain\u2019s status as a war hero \u2013 \u201cI like people that weren\u2019t captured, OK?\u201d Another was his complimenting daughter Ivanka\u2019s figure and saying that if she \u201cweren\u2019t my daughter, perhaps I\u2019d be dating her.\u201d\n\nInstead of being rattled, the participants ate up Trump\u2019s comments and left the meeting feeling even more confident in their support for him than when they had arrived.\n\n\u201cI think the Trump candidacy is here to stay and I think Republicans need to figure out how to deal with it,\u201d Luntz said. He said there is little the party establishment, journalists or his rivals with a background in politics can do to knock Trump down, because the candidate\u2019s supporters distrust those groups so strongly.\n\n\u201cIn essence, he\u2019s Teflon because the people most able to take him down can\u2019t because of the very jobs that they do,\u201d he said.\n\nIt\u2019s for that reason that Herman Cain, the former chief executive of Godfather\u2019s Pizza who rose to the top of the polls in the fall of 2011, only to see his fortunes derailed by allegations of sexual harassment, said he believes that Trump can succeed.\n\n\u201cIt is a totally new paradigm for how the race for president is unfolding,\u201d said Cain, making the case that Trump, as well as two other Republican candidates, former Hewlett-Packard chief executive Carly Fiorina and former neurosurgeon Ben Carson, had tapped into a portion of the electorate that is typically disengaged from the political process.\n\n\u2014\n\nMany of the Trump supporters interviewed by AP said there was a chance they might change their minds before voting next year or sit the contest out. Trump\u2019s campaign operation lacks the sophistication of many of his rivals, who in some cases have years of experience in politics and the business of getting out the vote.\n\nFor all of Trump\u2019s success so far, he\u2019s yet to drive any candidate from the race.\n\nThere are several debates still to come and five months until the Iowa caucuses \u2013 enough time for a rival to build a winning coalition of voters such as Marvin Smith, a Republican from Independence, Kentucky, who said Trump \u201cscares the hell out of me.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s appealing to some base emotions. But my worry is that he splinters the Republican Party,\u201d Smith said. \u201cHe\u2019s saying the message people want to hear, but I don\u2019t like the way he\u2019s saying it.\u201d\n\nBut anyone who has bet against Trump so far in this campaign has come up \u2013 as Trump would say \u2013 a loser.\n\nPaul Demerjian, a 55-year-old small business owner from Stoneham, Massachusetts, said he isn\u2019t much into politics. But there he was at a recent Trump rally outside Boston, mobbing Trump\u2019s SUV as he made his exit.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t been passionate about a politician running for office since Ronald Reagan,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "[anvplayer video=\"650327\"] NORWOOD, Mass.
