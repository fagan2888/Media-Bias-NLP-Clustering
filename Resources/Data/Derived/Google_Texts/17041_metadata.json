That\u2019s partly because we\u2019ve failed to update overtime regulations for years \u2014 and an exemption meant for highly paid, white collar employees now leaves out workers making as little as $23,660 a year \u2014 no matter how many hours they work.\u201d\n\nProponents say the threshold, designed to exempt highly paid white-collar workers, hasn\u2019t seen significant change for more than 40 years.\n\nEmployers say they will be saddled with more costs while the nation is trying add jobs to an economy that is still feeling the after-effects of a recession that officially ended in 2009.\n\nAnd while unemployment in the United States dropped to 5.3 percent in June compared with a high of 10 percent in October 2007, much can be explained because many people stopped looking for work.\n\nThe June figures \u201ccapture the persistently uneven nature of \u201cthe job market\u2019s recovery from the Great Recession,\u201d the Associated Press reported, adding that \u201cflat wage growth suggested that many employers may see no need to raise pay to attract or retain qualified workers.\u201d\n\nMississippi\u2019s unemployment rate crept up to 6.7 percent in May, 46th in the nation, from 6.6 percent in April, ending five straight months of falling joblessness rates.\n\nThe overtime proposal was posted Monday in the Federal Registry, kicking off a 60-day comment period. Comments can be posted at www.regulations.gov until Sept. 4.\n\nPepper Crutcher of the Balch and Bingham firm in Jackson, who says he practiced management law for more than 30 years until switching to Affordable Care Act compliance, believes there will be no clear winners and losers in the application of the new rules.\n\nCrutcher broke it down along political lines.\n\n\u201cThe Democrats have a built-in incentive to exaggerate the aggregate wage gains that will be created by this heightened salary requirement,\u201d and resulting demand that will jump-start the economy.\n\nRepublicans, on the other hand, say the plan is a business killer and at best it will result in passing costs along to consumers, \u201cwhich will actually depress the economy.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m saying is that this is like squeezing a balloon. Does it get bigger, does it get smaller? No, it just changes shape.\u201d\n\n\u201cEmployers look for work-arounds,\u201d he said. A manager now being paid a $35,000 or $40,000 is going to have a lot more hassle at work because his employer is going to be paying a lot more attention to what he does with his time.\u201d\n\nAnother option \u2014 \u201cand this is not without legal risks\u201d \u2014 is to convert the salary rate into the equivalent hourly rate.\n\nEmployers will look for places to trim their labor-cost budgets. That can mean shifting insurance costs to employees, cutting back on vacations and holidays and holding off on hiring. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to go to profits to get the money till they exhausted all other avenues.\u201d\n\nBlake Wilson, president and chief executive of the Mississippi Economic Council, the state chamber of commerce, agrees that businesses will manage their costs.\n\nBut they will be pushed toward a \u201cpunch-clock,\u201d \u201cwidget-making\u201d mentality that will not fit well, especially with the millennial generation.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re talking about young managers moving up, primarily. Millennials, who are used to having a lot of flexibility in their time, are going to end up in a punch-clock environment. Businesses are going to manage their costs. They\u2019re not going to have overtime; they\u2019re going to limit it. And the end of the day this is going to be a zero-sum game\u201d in which neither side wins.\n\nJennifer Hall of the Jackson office of Baker Donelson, which operates in 19 cities, said the law firm held a webinar on Monday that attracted 360 firms.\n\nThe Mississippi Employment Security Department said it could offer no information on the number of people who might be affected by the change.\n\nOne of Hall\u2019s clients, a chain of gas stations that is based in Tennessee but has a significant presence in Mississippi, has about 800 employees whose pay and duties would qualify them for the rules change.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Mississippi Business Journal", "description": "By JACK WEATHERLY\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe U.S. Department of Labor is planning to more than double the pay threshold...", "title": "Overtime policy plan for salaried workers draws mixed reviews", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://msbusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/overtime-620x330.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-05-22T16:43:51-05:00", "url": "http://msbusiness.com/2015/07/overtime-policy-plan-for-salaried-workers-draws-mixed-reviews/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/mbjournal", "section": "Govt/Politics", "tag": "Pepper Crutcher", "published_time": "2015-07-09T14:44:23-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-22T16:43:51-05:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "By JACK WEATHERLY\u00a0 The U.S. Department of Labor is planning to more than double the pay threshold to $50,440 from $23,660 for salaried workers who are exempt from overtime.
