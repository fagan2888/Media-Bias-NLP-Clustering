A new website aims to educate Americans about which plans under Obamacare cover abortion, providing detailed information about the current parameters for insurance carriers.

Created by the Family Research Council and the Charlotte Lozier Institute — two pro-life organizations — the Abortion in Obamacare website offers an interactive map that provides detailed content about how abortion is dealt with by plans in each state, according to Live Action News.

The map and website launched as Obamacare’s open enrollment period, which began November 15, is underway; it will continue through Feb. 15, 2015. The website also comes following a report that taxpayer dollars are being used to potentially fund abortion.

“During this time Americans can sign up for Obamacare plans and many will receive taxpayer-funded subsidies to help pay for these plans,” reads a description on the Abortion in Obamacare website. “The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has found that 1,036 of Obamacare plans sold in 2014 included abortion on demand.”

The website and interactive map pledge to help Americans dig deeper to discern whether abortion is covered in prospective plans they are considering — a task that the Family Research Council and the Charlotte Lozier Institute claim is currently difficult due to a lack of transparency.

“This is critical information since individuals purchasing plans that include abortion are required to pay a hidden abortion surcharge,” the website reads. “Through the surcharge, a portion of each individual’s insurance premium goes into a fund used to pay for abortion on demand.”

The organizations do caution that the information presented is limited, but that they are scouring the Internet and contacting insurance companies in an effort to provide comprehensive data.
