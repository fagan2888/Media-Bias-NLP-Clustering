Cole Yoos, a chaplain aboard George Washington. \u201cAs we think about our Navy, it\u2019s the diversity and everyone coming together as a team that make us so strong. These events help us celebrate the diversity aboard our ship and throughout the Navy.\u201d\n\nThis year\u2019s theme of celebrating Native pride and spirit yesterday, today and forever encouraged all crew members to reflect on Native American impacts throughout U.S. history.\n\nAccording to the Naval History and Heritage Command, there are currently more than 15,000 Sailors and 1,280 civilians of Native American and Alaska Native heritage serving in or working in direct support of the U.S. Navy.\n\n\u201cFor Natives, serving in the military has always been a noble and honored tradition,\u201d said Aviation Boatswain\u2019s Mate (Fuel) Airman Recruit Johnathan Hernandez, the keynote speaker, from San Carlos, Arizona.\n\n\u201cMore than 44,000 Indians served in World War II, and during the Pacific campaign, Navajo code talkers transmitted secret messages in their own language, saving countless lives. It\u2019s important that we take days like today to recognize all the groups of Native Americans that contributed to the U.S.\u201d\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Interior\u2019s Bureau of Indian Affairs, there are 4.5 million American Indian and Alaska Natives among 565 federally recognized tribes, which represent 1.5 percent of the nation\u2019s population.\n\nAccording to Hernandez, Native Americans have served in key roles through every major U.S. military engagement both on land and at sea. Native American seamen served on continental and state vessels during the War of Independence, and 20,000 Native Americans contributed to both Union and Confederate forces during the Civil War as auxiliary troops.\n\n\u201cNot a lot of people are familiar with Native American history, so being able to scratch the surface and talk about the proud histories of our tribes means a lot to me,\u201d said Interior Communications Electrician Seaman Meghan Kennedy, the event\u2019s master of ceremonies, from Johnsburg, Illinois. \u201cYou open people\u2019s eyes to things they never thought about with celebrations like this and give a little back story into Native American history.\u201d\n\nGeorge Washington and its embarked air wing, Carrier Air Wing (CVW) 5, provide a combat-ready force that protects and defends the collective maritime interests of the U.S. and its allies and partners in the Indo-Asia-Pacific region.\n\nChris Cavagnaro is a Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class working for USS George Washington Public Affairs.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Those aboard the USS George Washington recently celebrated Native American Heritage Month to honor more than 200 years of Native military service.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/11/28/celebrating-heritage-month-uss-george-washington-157999", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/uss-george-washington-heritage-month.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Celebrating Heritage Month on the USS George Washington"}, "abstract": "Those aboard the USS George Washington recently celebrated Native American Heritage Month to honor more than 200 years of Native military service.", "dc": {"title": "Celebrating Heritage Month on the USS George Washington"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/11/28/celebrating-heritage-month-uss-george-washington-157999", "dcterms.creator": "leeanne", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Native American Heritage Month, American Indian veterans, Navajo Code Talkers, Native American History", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.date": "2014-11-28T15:00-05:00", "dcterms.title": "Celebrating Heritage Month on the USS George Washington"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf305\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIt\u2019s important for us to not only recognize Native American Heritage Month, but all cultural heritage events,\u201d said Lt. j.g.\nChris Cavagnaro is a Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class working for USS George Washington Public Affairs.\nWATERS SOUTH OF JAPAN\u2014Sailors aboard Nimitz-class aircraft carrier USS George Washington (CVN 73) celebrated Native American Heritage Month on the ship\u2019s mess decks during a ceremony hosted by the ship\u2019s multicultural committee, November 24.\nCole Yoos, a chaplain aboard George Washington.\nAccording to the Naval History and Heritage Command, there are currently more than 15,000 Sailors and 1,280 civilians of Native American and Alaska Native heritage serving in or working in direct support of the U.S. Navy."}
