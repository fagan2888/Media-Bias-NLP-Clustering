But these debates can be important \u2013 as is the case with one proposal that is gaining traction.\n\nI\u2019m talking about the suggestion by the Equity Capital Formation Task Force to try and spur more trading in small-company stocks by moving away from \u201cdecimalization\u201d \u2013 having stocks trade in one-penny increments on exchanges \u2013 and going back to the days when the spreads between the bid and ask prices was wider.\n\nUp until the late 1990s, trading was pretty straightforward \u2013 you\u2019d want to buy 100 shares of XYZ, and you\u2019d be quoted a figure of perhaps $37 1/4, or $37 3/8; if you wanted to sell, the price might be $37 or $37 1/8. The idea is pretty familiar to anyone who\u2019s ever changed their greenbacks for a foreign currency while on holiday: Not only do you pay a commission, but your rate is set up in such a way that you\u2019ll have to buy high and sell low.\n\nIn the late 1990s, the SEC added trading in sixteenths \u2013 or \u201cteenies,\u201d as they instantly were dubbed by trading floor denizens \u2013 and then, in 2001, came decimalization, with the idea being that a smaller \u201cspread\u201d between the bid and the asked prices would make trading more efficient and less costly.\n\nRelated: PNC Bank\u2019s Chairman Opens Mouth, Inserts Wingtip\n\nDecimalization always had its detractors, although it\u2019s hard to draw a definite link between the pricing change and the problems that critics identify. Yes, price points move more rapidly, meaning that to capture the benefit of low costs, some investors may have to trade more frequently than they did before. But is that frequent movement in prices the result of the change in market structure or the arrival of new players in the trading universe, such as high-frequency trading firms?\n\nMoreover, even if someone has to trade a few more times to complete the purchase or sale of a block of shares, the fact remains that those trades are likely to have less of an impact on the market, meaning that they can complete the trade before the price gets ahead of them. With a minimum spread of 12.5 cents, for instance, purchasing a big block of shares might have been simpler but more costly, showing up immediately in the price. When a price can only go up or down by a penny, there are opportunities for others to jump in along the way.\n\nThere\u2019s no such thing as a perfect market structure, and there are plenty of problems and unresolved questions about the way stock trading functions today. We\u2019ve got dark pools and high-frequency trading, which are in the midst of reshaping the market environment in ways we don\u2019t yet understand. \"Connectivity issues\" that spark trading shutdowns have become frequent enough to spark jokes in the Twitterverse about rogue squirrels nibbling away on cables. Then there are big snafus, such as the one that wreaked havoc during Twitter\u2019s IPO debut.\n\nRegulators aren\u2019t keeping up. Years after the Dodd-Frank Act was passed, it remains unclear how the new rules banning proprietary trading by banks will affect such grey areas as market making, in which financial institutions take positions so that they can accommodate current and future trading needs of their clients.\n\nNonetheless, for the Equity Capital Formation Task Force the market structure issue on which we all should be focusing our attention remains the minimum \u201ctick size,\u201d or the spread between the bid and asked price.\n\nThis is the organization that has been behind some other initiatives, including crowdfunding start-up companies, that it believes will help spark capital formation. By changing the market structure for smaller companies, the group expects that trading activity will increase, market-makers will return to the business of buying and selling smaller stocks (because it will be more profitable) and the enhanced liquidity will attract more coverage from research analysts. That chain of events would make it easier overall for small companies to raise capital in the public markets, or so the argument goes.\n\nNow, I\u2019m not suggesting that there aren\u2019t obstacles confronting smaller companies that want to be public. Yes, it\u2019s hard to get research coverage and to convince a trading firm to make a market in your stock. But I\u2019m not sure that changing the market structure is the way to address them. The problem is far more fundamental.\n\n\u201cIf there was money to be made trading old sneakers, Wall Street would be involved,\u201d points out Mike Driscoll, a veteran of Wall Street trading floors, who has seen the evolution of trading from eighths to \u201cteenies\u201d to pennies. \u201cProviding research coverage and making money for those [smaller] companies just doesn\u2019t make money for big banks, and smaller institutions are so lean right now that they can\u2019t afford it.\u201d Nor, he argues, will changing the spreads alter that fact.\n\nIndeed, what Driscoll, now teaching finance at Adelphi University and completing his PhD at the University of Pennsylvania, witnessed firsthand on the trading floor was that decimalization made it easier for his clients \u2013 including the mutual funds that the Equity Capital Formation Task Force claims suffered most \u2013 to accumulate or sell large positions in small stocks. \u201cThe markets were tighter and more liquid.\u201d\n\nRelated: JPMorgan Deal Won\u2019t Close the Books on Mortgage Fraud\n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with trying out new trading systems to see if they\u2019ll work, but the reality is that top-down initiatives rarely do work when it comes to the financial markets \u2013 and this is one area in which that kind of top-down intervention isn\u2019t really called for, since we\u2019re not talking about protecting the investor or the integrity of capital markets.\n\nThe Equity Capital Formation Task Force might be better off focusing on the broader challenges to economic growth (which make businesses and investors risk averse) or to ensuring that new market regulations are structured in as predictable and rational way as possible, to minimize uncertainty among the firms that have the resources to step into the void and commit resources to the world of small and micro-cap companies.\n\nUltimately, if both the buy side and the sell side on Wall Street don\u2019t think that they\u2019re likely to make money from this space, they won\u2019t commit resources to it. Citigroup (NYSE: C) is interested in test-driving a system under which the tick size of less liquid stocks would be increased, but it will surely lose interest if the pilot program doesn\u2019t prove profitable. (In particular, Citi won\u2019t continue doing so if it finds itself at war with high-frequency traders trying to insist on their right to trade in pennies or even fractions of a penny.)\n\nAt some point, if a real gap emerges and there is a strong demand for a better service, someone on a trading desk somewhere will spot it. That person will set up his or her own firm to exploit the opportunity by making markets in illiquid stocks. It has happened before, and it will happen again. That\u2019s what groups like the Equity Capital Formation Task Force should be looking for and supporting.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Market structure debates can sometimes feel so arcane that you\u2019d be forgiven if you preferred to train your attention instead on watching paint dry.
