On the one hand, he has vehemently denounced the evils of global capitalism, calling it \u201ca new tyranny.\u201d However, as pontiff, he heads the Catholic Church, which has been characterized as \u201cprobably the wealthiest institution in the entire world.\u201d And, although the pope has championed the importance of women in the Catholic Church, saying in an interview, \u201cThe woman is essential for the church. ... The feminine genius is needed whenever we make important decisions,\u201d he continues to oppose as strongly as any pope before him the ordination of women, and considers abortion to be evil. How do we make sense of Pope Francis\u2019 views?\n\nIt turns out that his critique of capitalism is actually nothing new. According to human rights activist Blase Bonpane, a former Maryknoll priest and adherent of \u201cliberation theology,\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s been going on for a long time. If we take the 19th century, we had Pope Leo XIII who gave us the encyclical \u2018Rerum Novarum,\u2019 which followed directly from \u2018The Communist Manifesto.\u2019 The pope agreed with practically everything in the \u2018Manifesto\u2019 by talking about how people go into the factories and are ruined, whereas materials come out of the factory ennobled. And that was followed by another encyclical by Pius XI called \u2018Quadragesimo Anno\u2019 in the 1930s, 40 years after Leo XIII\u2019s encyclical. These were anti-capitalist documents.\u201d In fact, according to Bonpane, \u201cPius XI called for a living wage and defined it very well as \u2018one worker in the family, time for vacation, an ability to save money, to have a decent life, to pay for all of your needs.\u2019 So we have not always complied with what the popes are talking about but they have had many anti-capitalist statements going back to John the Baptist who said, \u2018If someone has two pairs of shoes, give one to someone who doesn\u2019t have any.\u2019 So [this sentiment] has been in the history of the church despite its opulence.\u201d\n\nIn that sense, Pope Francis represents a break not from the long-term tradition of the church, but from his immediate predecessors. Bonpane said, \u201cI think it\u2019s a dramatic change for him to focus on the liberation theology elements [of Catholicism], which is to downplay dogma.\u201d In addition to his recent statements denouncing the ills of modern global capitalism, there are reports of the pope quietly stepping out of the halls of the Vatican at night to help poor and homeless people. If that\u2019s not enough to cement his progressive economic policy credentials, Pope Francis has also provoked the ire of right-wing shock jock Rush Limbaugh, who accused him of \u201cripping capitalism\u201d and being a Marxist.\n\nStill, there remains the question of the Vatican\u2019s vast and shady financial empire, estimated to value in the billions of dollars and plagued by allegations of money laundering. If the pope is so interested in redistribution of wealth, why doesn\u2019t he just give it all away? Bonpane chuckled, \u201cThat would be a great idea! I think it would help the church immensely if [the Vatican] became a huge museum complex. Jesus didn\u2019t call for a Vatican. He didn\u2019t even call for a building! He was on the street. He didn\u2019t talk about rigid dogmatic compliance. He talked about serving the poor and realizing that whatever we do for those in need is our connection to the Almighty.\u201d So even though, according to Pope Francis, we \u201chave to say \u2018thou shalt not\u2019 to an economy of exclusion and inequality,\u201d and that \u201cSuch an economy kills,\u201d it does not appear as though he will redistribute Vatican wealth anytime soon.\n\nThe pope also has a complex relationship with social issues such as women\u2019s rights and the role of the LGBT community in the Catholic Church. In an interview earlier this year, he said, \u201cWomen are asking deep questions that must be addressed. The church cannot be herself without the woman and her role.\u201d Jon O\u2019Brien, president of Catholics for Choice, is cautiously heartened. He told me in an interview, \u201cAs someone who really cares about issues that are central to women, I have to say that I welcomed what Pope Francis [has] said. Because he basically called for the Catholic Church to be home for all and not just a small chapel focused on very narrow interpretations of what the moral issues really are of the day. And that message resonates with so many Catholics because it reflects our personal experience that Catholics are gay and lesbian, Catholics use birth control, Catholics have abortions.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Square, Site wide\n\nThe pope has also said that the church has expended too much effort being fixated on contraception and abortion. O\u2019Brien said he believes it is a good thing for the church to pull back its focus on those issues, \u201cbecause if you look at what the Conference of Catholic Bishops here in the United States has been saying and the amount of time they spent telling us we shouldn\u2019t be using contraception, 98 percent of women in the United States use a method of contraception the bishops don\u2019t like. It does get a bit laborious when we see them up on Capitol Hill lobbying against President Obama\u2019s coverage of contraception as part of the Affordable Care Act. So the idea that we\u2019d hear church hierarchy speak less about it, is a good thing.\u201d\n\nBut the pope draws the line at abortion. O\u2019Brien cited how the pontiff made it clear to a group of gynecologists gathered at the Vatican that \u201che would expect them, in his opinion, to continue to not provide abortions and that they should refuse to provide women with the right to choose.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "blase bonpane, capitalism, catholic church, communism, hypocrisy, liberation theology, pope francis, reform", "og": {"site_name": "Truthdig", "description": "It turns out that the pope\u2019s critique of capitalism is actually nothing new.\n - 2013/12/12", "title": "Reformer or Hypocrite?
