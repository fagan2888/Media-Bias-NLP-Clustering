A lifetime hot rodder, Bruce Meyer of Beverly Hills dreamed of roaring across the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah.

He finally got his wish, managing to hit 204 miles per hour in a 1929 Ford hot rod.

Yes, a 1929 Ford, but actually the outside was really kind of a "shell" of a body, as Meyer describes it. The engine underneath came out of a Chevrolet and been hopped up to about 1,000 horsepower.

Meyer, who collects cars, said he had his share of fear about the experience, but recommends it to everyone who loves hot rods. We imagine he calmed down and managed to smile once the car's parachute deployed after its high-speed run.
