Some hospitals, such as Cleveland Clinic, MedStar and Salt Lake City's Intermountain Healthcare, address these problems in partnership with the National Research Corporation, deriving ratings directly from Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) data, according to the article.\n\nIntermountain began posting online reviews from its 22 hospitals and 185 clinics in late July, according to HealthcareDive. It bases the reviews on a third-party assessment derived from HCAHPS, which it translates to a star rating. The system posts positive feedback immediately but flags negative reviews, warning the physician involved. After the physician is notified, the organization posts these unedited reviews unless they contain obscene language or potential privacy violations.\n\nThe University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) has announced an almost identical initiative, the first medical center in the state to do so, according to the Associated Press.\n\nThe increasingly comprehensive nature of hospital efforts to share patient feedback is cause for optimism, writes Ibbotson. \"Changing the way you do business to meet the rise of healthcare consumerism might be as simple as dusting off the data you already collect and using it to equip people with the information they have come to expect when searching for new products and services.\"\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the Executive Insight article\n\n- here's the Healthcare Dive article\n\n- check out the AP article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nYelp expands its hospital reviews: ER wait times, doc communication now available to consumers\n\nHospitals develop online ratings strategy in quest for patient satisfaction\n\nOnline ratings don't help patients determine best hospitals\n\nFive-star hospitals double in quarterly Hospital Compare update\n\nCMS rolls out five-star scale to rank hospitals on patient experience\n\nRegulatory watchdog calls for more transparency on CMS star-rating methodology\n\nBest and worst hospital rankings often conflict, confuse consumers\n\nCMS to update Hospital Compare rankings with critical access data\n\nHospital Compare scores unlikely to improve outcomes", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hospitals are increasingly incorporating online reviews into their patient satisfaction efforts, but despite their efforts so far, they have considerable work to do to provide patients with meaningful information, according to Executive Insight.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Hospitals are increasingly incorporating online reviews into their patient satisfaction efforts, but despite their efforts so far, they have considerable work to do to provide patients with meaningful information, according to Executive Insight.", "title": "Online patient reviews often lack numbers, substance", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/online-patient-reviews-often-lack-numbers-substance/2015-10-05", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Care Delivery,data transparency,Hospital Consumer Assessment of Health Providers and Systems (HCAHPS),Intermountain Health Care System,online reviews,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes,patient feedback,patient satisfaction,The Cleveland Clinic", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "article_summary": "Intermountain began posting online reviews from its 22 hospitals and 185 clinics in late July, according to HealthcareDive.\nHospitals are increasingly incorporating online reviews into their patient satisfaction efforts, but despite their efforts so far, they have considerable work to do to provide patients with meaningful information, according to Executive Insight.\nAfter the physician is notified, the organization posts these unedited reviews unless they contain obscene language or potential privacy violations.\nThe increasingly comprehensive nature of hospital efforts to share patient feedback is cause for optimism, writes Ibbotson.\nIt bases the reviews on a third-party assessment derived from HCAHPS, which it translates to a star rating."}
