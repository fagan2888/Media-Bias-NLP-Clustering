Austin is the final leg in his three city trip before returning to Washington. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)\n\nPresident Obama delivered a speech on the economy on Thursday at the Paramount Theatre. Below is a full transcript of his remarks:\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Hello, Austin! (Applause.) Hey! Hello, Austin! (Applause.) All right, everybody have a seat, have a seat.\n\nIt\u2019s good to be in Austin, Texas. (Applause.) Can everybody please give Kinsey a big round of applause for the great introduction? (Applause.)\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: We love you!\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: That\u2019s because I love you. (Applause.) Everybody knows I love Austin, Texas. (Applause.) Every time I come here I tell you how much I love you. I love Austin. I love the people. I love the barbecue \u2014 which I will get right after this. (Laughter.) I like the music. (Applause.) I\u2019ve got good memories here, I\u2019ve got good friends.\n\nI was telling somebody the last time I walked a real walk where I was kind of left alone was in Austin, Texas. (Applause.) Right before the debate here during the primary in 2007? 2008? It must have been 2008. And I was walking along the river and nobody noticed me, and I felt great. (Laughter.) And then on the way back somebody did notice me and Secret Service started coming around and \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 but that first walk was really good. So let\u2019s face it, I just love Austin. (Applause.) Love the people of Austin.\n\nI want to thank a proud Texan, Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, for being here today. We appreciate her. (Applause.)\n\nIt is great to play at the Paramount. I think I finally made it. I finally arrived. (Applause.) I\u2019ve enjoyed the last couple of days, just getting out of Washington. And we started in Colorado, in Denver, and then went to Dallas and then came down here. And at each stop I\u2019ve been able to just meet people and talk about people\u2019s lives \u2014 their hopes, their dreams.\n\nI just had some coffee, as Kinsey may have mentioned, at the Magnolia Caf\u00e9, which is very nice. (Applause.) It was fun, too, because I had a chance to \u2014 there were a bunch of folks there and some EMT folks were there on their break after the shift, and there were a group of high school kids who were getting together \u2014 they were about to go on a two-weeklong service trip to Peru \u2014 which, by the way, reminds you, you should be optimistic whenever you meet young people because they\u2019re full of energy and idealism. And so they were going to do this service trip and they were going to go for two days, then, to Machu Picchu \u2014 the old Inca ruins in Peru. And I said, I always wanted to go there. And they said, well, you can come with us if you want. (Laughter.) And I said, I\u2019m really tempted, but I think there are some things I\u2019ve got to do. (Laughter.)\n\nBut I got them \u2014 in exchange for a selfie with them, they promised that they would send me a picture of them when they get there. So I\u2019m going to hold them to it. We got their email and if I don\u2019t get it I\u2019ll be upset. (Laughter.)\n\nAnyway, so I was talking to Kinsey because she wrote me a letter and I wanted to reply in person. Because, as some of you may know, every day, we get tens of thousands of letters or correspondence, emails at the White House. And ever since the first day I was in office, what I\u2019ve asked our Correspondence Office to do is to select 10 of them for me to read every night. And in these letters, people tell me their stories. They talk about losing a job, or finding a job. They talk about trying to finance a college education. They talk about challenges because maybe they\u2019re the children of immigrants and they\u2019re worried about their status. They talk about the hardships they\u2019re going through, successes they\u2019ve had, things they hope for, things that they\u2019re afraid of when it comes to the future and their lives.\n\nSometimes people say thank you for something I\u2019ve done or a position I\u2019ve taken, and some people say, \u201cYou\u2019re an idiot.\u201d (Laughter.) And that\u2019s how I know that I\u2019m getting a good representative sampling because \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 half the letters are less than impressed with me.\n\nSo Kinsey wrote me to tell me about her family. Her mom was a preschool teacher, her dad was an engineer. Together, obviously, they worked really hard, raised a family. They were responsible, did all the right things, were able to put their kids through college. Then they lost their jobs. And because they lost their jobs as mid-career persons, a lot of their resumes didn\u2019t get answered. And their savings started to dwindle. And Kinsey works to pay for school, but it\u2019s not enough.\n\nAnd she told me that she\u2019s always been passionate about politics and the issues of the day, but after last year\u2019s government shutdown, all this stuff that\u2019s happened with her family, it doesn\u2019t seem like anybody in Washington is thinking about them. She wrote, \u201cI became a disgruntled citizen. I felt as if my government, my beloved government that\u2019s supposed to look out for the needs of all Americans had failed me. My parents have always supported my siblings and me,\u201d she wrote, \u201cnow it\u2019s my turn to help them. I want to be involved. President Obama, what can I do?\u201d\n\nSo I wanted to meet with Kinsey to let her know that I had heard her, that I listened to what was happening with her family, and I was thinking about her parents and I was thinking about her and her sisters. And I\u2019m here today because of Kinsey. And I\u2019m here today because of every American who is working their tail off and does everything right and who believes in the American Dream and just wants a chance to build a decent life for themselves and their families.\n\nAnd you and folks like Kinsey are the reason I ran for President in the first place \u2014 (applause) \u2014 because your lives are the lives that I lived. When I listen to Kinsey I think about me and Michelle trying to finance our college education. When I think about somebody who didn\u2019t have health care, I think about my mom when she had cancer that would ultimately end her life at about the age I am now. When I think about equal pay, I think about my grandmother working her way up at a bank with nothing but a high school education and becoming the vice president of the bank, but always being kind of passed over for the next stage by men who were less qualified than she was.\n\nSo the stories that I hear in these letters, they\u2019re my story, and they\u2019re Michelle\u2019s story, and they\u2019re the story that we had before I became senator \u2014 worrying about child care, trying to figure out how to have a balanced life so that if Malia or Sasha got sick we could take time off, and how do you manage all that.\n\nSo that\u2019s why these letters are so important to me. And that\u2019s why whenever I\u2019m out of Washington, part of what I want to do is just to remember and to connect with your stories so that you know that what I\u2019m trying to do every single day is based on that experience.\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you! (Applause.)\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: And when you see the trajectory of Kinsey\u2019s family, in some ways, it\u2019s a little bit a story of what\u2019s happened to America.\n\nThe crisis in 2008 hurt us all badly \u2014 worse financial crisis since the Great Depression. But you think about the progress we\u2019ve made. Today, our businesses have added nearly 10 million new jobs over the past 52 months. (Applause.) Our housing is rebounding. Our auto industry is booming. Manufacturing is adding more jobs than any time since the 1990s. The unemployment rate is the lowest point it\u2019s been since September of 2008. (Applause.) Kinsey\u2019s dad found a new job that he loves in the field he was trained for. (Applause.) So a lot of this was because of the resilience and hard work of the American people. That\u2019s what happens \u2014 Americans bounce back.\n\nBut some of it had to do with decisions we made to build our economy on a new foundation. And those decisions are paying off. We\u2019re more energy independent. For the first time in nearly 20 years, we produce more oil here at home than we buy from abroad. (Applause.) The world\u2019s largest oil and gas producer isn\u2019t Russia; it\u2019s not Saudi Arabia \u2014 it\u2019s the United States of America. (Applause.)\n\nAt the same time, we\u2019ve reduced our total carbon pollution over the past eight years more than any country on Earth. (Applause.) We\u2019ve tripled the amount of electricity we generate from wind. We\u2019ve increased the amount of solar energy we have by 10 times. We\u2019re creating jobs across the country in clean energy. (Applause.)\n\nIn education, our high school graduation rate is at a record high; the Latino dropout rate has been cut in half since 2000. (Applause.) More young people are graduating from college than ever before.\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Si se puede!\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Si se peude. (Laughter.)\n\nThe Affordable Care Act has given millions more families peace of mind. They won\u2019t go broke just because they get sick. (Applause.) Our deficits have been cut by more than half.\n\nWe have come farther and recovered faster, thanks to you, than just about any other nation on Earth. (Applause.) And so we\u2019ve got a lot to be encouraged by, just as the story of Kinsey\u2019s family makes us feel more encouraged. For the first time in a decade, business leaders around the world have said the number-one place to invest is not China, it\u2019s the United States of America. So we\u2019re actually seeing companies bring jobs back. (Applause.) So there\u2019s no doubt that we are making progress. By almost every measure, we are better off now than we were when I took office. (Applause.)\n\nBut the fact is we\u2019ve still got a long way to go. We\u2019ve still got a long way to go, because while we\u2019re creating more jobs faster these first six months of this year than any time since 1999, we know there are still a lot of folks out there who are looking for work or looking for more full-time work or looking for a better-paying job. Corporate profits are higher than ever. CEOs make more than ever. But you\u2019re working harder than ever just to get by and pay the bills.\n\nSo, as a whole, the country is doing better. But the problem is, is that so much of the improved productivity and profits have gone to the folks at the very top, and the average person, their wages and incomes haven\u2019t really gone up at all, and in some cases, haven\u2019t kept up with the rising cost of health care or college or all the basic necessities that people need.\n\nAnd so, Austin, I\u2019m here to say that this country is not going to succeed if just a few are doing well. This country succeeds when everybody has got a shot. (Applause.) The country does better when the middle class does better, and when there are more ladders of opportunity into the middle class. (Applause.) That\u2019s the kind of economy that works here in America. And that\u2019s what\u2019s at stake right now.\n\nNow, that\u2019s why we\u2019re fighting for an opportunity agenda that creates more good jobs and creates more good wages \u2014 jobs in American manufacturing, jobs in construction. We should be rebuilding infrastructure all across America, putting people back to work rebuilding roads and bridges and schools, creating a smart grid to transmit clean energy across the country more efficiently. (Applause.)\n\nWe can create good jobs in American energy \u2014 (sneezes) \u2014 bless me \u2014 and innovation. (Laughter.) I\u2019m okay, just haven\u2019t had enough sleep. (Laughter.)\n\nWe\u2019re fighting for an opportunity agenda that trains more workers with the skills to fill the jobs that are being created. I was talking to some folks from a community college before I came out here. We\u2019ve learned that if we reach out to businesses and help them design the training programs in the community colleges, then when somebody finishes that training, they know they can get a job right away. (Applause.)\n\nWe\u2019re fighting for an opportunity agenda that guarantees every child a world-class education from the time that they are three until the time that they graduate from college.\n\nWe\u2019re fighting for an opportunity agenda that makes sure your hard work pays off with higher wages and equal pay for equal work, and workplace flexibility, and the overtime pay you\u2019ve earned. (Applause.)\n\nWe\u2019re fighting for opportunity for all and the idea that no matter who you are and what you look like and where you come from and who you love, if you work hard in America, if you work hard in Austin, if you work hard in Texas, you can make it here. (Applause.) You can make it. (Applause.)\n\nSo that\u2019s what we\u2019re working for. And the good news is, is that the things that we need to do are well within our capabilities, our grasp. We know we can \u2014 we know how to build roads. We know how to put people back to work on infrastructure. We know that if we invest in early childhood education, every dollar we put in, we get seven dollars back, and fewer dropouts and fewer teen pregnancies, and fewer folks going into the criminal justice system. (Applause.)\n\nWe know that if we do some basic things, if we make some basic changes, we\u2019ll see more jobs, faster economic growth, lift more incomes, strengthen the middle class. They are common-sense things. They\u2019re not that radical. We know it\u2019s what we should be doing. And what drives me nuts \u2014 and I know drives you nuts \u2014 is Washington isn\u2019t doing it. (Applause.)\n\nAnd let me be clear about why Washington is broken, because sometimes everybody says, well, you know what, all politicians are the same, he parties \u2014 the Democrats, Republicans, it doesn\u2019t matter. Look, Democrats are not perfect, I promise you. I know a lot of them. (Laughter.) And, yes, every member of Congress, they\u2019re thinking about, I\u2019d like to be reelected and I\u2019d like to keep my job. That\u2019s human nature. We all understand that. But let me be clear. On the common-sense agenda that would help middle-class families, the overwhelming number of Democrats are in favor of these things.\n\nThey\u2019re in favor of minimum wage. They\u2019re in favor of equal pay. (Applause.) They\u2019re in favor of extending unemployment benefits. They\u2019re in favor of infrastructure. They\u2019re in favor of investing in research and development. They\u2019re in favor of making college more affordable. They\u2019ve got specific proposals. They\u2019re willing to compromise. They\u2019re prepared to go forward.\n\nSo when folks say they\u2019re frustrated with Congress, let\u2019s be clear about what the problem is. (Applause.) I\u2019m just telling the truth now. I don\u2019t have to run for office again, so I can just let her rip. (Applause.) And I want to assure you, I\u2019m really not that partisan of a guy. My favorite President is the first Republican President, a guy named Abraham Lincoln. You look at our history, and we had great Republican Presidents who \u2014 like Teddy Roosevelt started the National Park System, and Dwight Eisenhower built the Interstate Highway System, and Richard Nixon started the EPA.\n\nThe statement I\u2019m making is not a partisan statement, it is a statement of fact. (Applause.) So far this year, Republicans in Congress have blocked or voted down every serious idea to strengthen the middle class. They have said no \u2014\n\nAUDIENCE: Booo!\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Don\u2019t boo now, because what I want you to do is vote. (Applause.)\n\nThey\u2019ve said no to raising the minimum wage. They\u2019ve said no to fair pay. They said no to unemployment insurance for hardworking folks like Kinsey\u2019s parents who have paid taxes all their lives and never depended on anything and just needed a little help to get over a hump. They said no to fixing our broken immigration system that we know would strengthen our borders and our businesses and help families. (Applause.)\n\nInstead of investing in education that helps working families, they voted to give another massive tax cut to the wealthiest Americans. Instead of creating jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our ports that help every business, they\u2019ve decided to protect tax loopholes for companies that are shifting jobs overseas and profits overseas.\n\nThe best thing you can say about this Congress \u2014 the Republicans in Congress, and particularly the House of Representatives \u2014 the best you can say for them this year is that so far they have not shut down the government \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 or threatened to have America welch on our obligations and ruin our credit rating. That\u2019s the best you can say. But of course, it\u2019s only July \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 so who knows what they may cook up in the next few months.\n\nSo even as they\u2019re blocking policies that would help middle-class families, they keep on offering these theories of the economy that have failed over and over again. They say, well, if we give more tax breaks to folks at the top that\u2019s going to be good. If we make fewer investments in things like education, everything will work out. If we loosen the rules for big banks and credit card companies and polluters and insurers, somehow that\u2019s going to make the economy better. If we shrink the safety net and cut Medicaid and cut food stamps, and make sure that folks who are vulnerable and trying to get back on their suffer more hardship, somehow that\u2019s going to improve the economy.\n\nNow, they believe these things \u2014 sincerely, I assume \u2014 that if they \u2014 if we do these things, if we just take care of folks at the top, or at least if we don\u2019t empower our government to be able to help anybody, that somehow jobs and prosperity will trickle down and we\u2019ll all be better off.\n\nAnd that may work just fine for folks at the top. It worked fine for me. I don\u2019t need government. (Laughter.) Michelle and I now are in a position where we can pretty much finance Malia and Sasha\u2019s college education. But I remember when Michelle\u2019s parents couldn\u2019t, they needed help. And I don\u2019t know about you, but I don\u2019t believe in pulling up the ladder once I\u2019m up. I believe in extending it down and making sure that everybody has a chance to climb up. (Applause.)\n\nThe status quo certainly works for the special interests in Washington who like things just as they are. They\u2019ll be fine whether Congress ever passes a bill again or not. But it doesn\u2019t help you. It doesn\u2019t help your neighbors. It doesn\u2019t help your friends. It doesn\u2019t help your communities.\n\nAnd what it does, is it just feeds people\u2019s cynicism about Washington. It just makes people think, well, nothing can happen, and people start feeling hopeless. And we have to understand, in the face of all evidence to the contrary in Washington, we can do better than we\u2019re doing right now. (Applause.) We can do better than what we\u2019re doing right now.\n\nWe know from our history, our economy does not grow from the top down, it grows from the middle up. It grows from a rising, thriving middle class. It grows when we got ladders of opportunity for everybody, and every young person in America is feeling hopeful and has a chance to do what they can with the God-given talents that they have. That\u2019s what we\u2019re fighting for. That is what you should be fighting for. (Applause.)\n\nAnd I will always look \u2014 I\u2019ll always look for ways to get Republicans and Democrats together in this effort. But I\u2019m not \u2014 I can\u2019t stand by with partisan gridlock that\u2019s the result of cynical political games that threaten the hard work of millions of Americans. I\u2019m not just going to stand by and say, okay, that\u2019s \u2014 I guess that\u2019s the way it is. Whenever and wherever I have the power, the legal authority to help families like yours, even if Congress is not doing anything, I will take that opportunity. I will try to make something happen. (Applause.)\n\nAnd that\u2019s the reason \u2014 that\u2019s the reason why my administration has taken more than 40 different actions just this year to help working Americans \u2014 because Congress won\u2019t.\n\nCongress won\u2019t act to make sure a woman gets equal pay for equal work. So I made sure more women have the protections they need to fight for fair pay in the workplace \u2014 because I think when women succeed America succeeds. So we went ahead and did that. (Applause.)\n\nCongress won\u2019t act to create jobs in manufacturing or construction. Well, I went ahead and speeded up permits for big projects. We launched a new hub to attract more high-tech manufacturing jobs to America. I want to make sure the next revolution in manufacturing is right here in America; it\u2019s an American revolution, not a German or a Chinese revolution. I want it happening right here in Austin, Texas. (Applause.)\n\nCongress so far hasn\u2019t acted to help more young people manage their student loan debt. So I acted with my lawful authority to give nearly 5 million Americans the chance to cap their student loan payments at 10 percent of their income so they can manage it better, so that if they go into teaching, or they go into social work, or they\u2019re doing something at a non-for-profit, that they\u2019re not encumbered by mountains of debt. I don\u2019t want our future leaders saddled with debt before they start out in life. (Applause.)\n\nAnd Republicans in Congress so far have refused to raise workers\u2019 wages with a higher minimum wage. So I acted to require that federal contractors pay their employees a fair wage of at least $10.10 an hour \u2014 (applause) \u2014 which would give hundreds of thousands of workers a raise. I asked business owners and governors and mayors and state legislators \u2014 anybody I could work with \u2014 do what you can on your own, I told them.\n\nSince the first time I asked Congress to raise the minimum wage, Congress hasn\u2019t done anything, but 13 states have gone ahead and raised theirs. (Applause.) And, by the way \u2014 this is important to remember just because folks are always trying to run the okey doke on you \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 the states that have increased their minimum wages this year have seen higher job growth than the states that have not increased their minimum wage. (Applause.) And more and more business owners are choosing to lift the wages for their workers because they understand that it\u2019s going to be good to have productive workers, loyal workers, invested workers.\n\nJust yesterday, before I came down to Texas, when I was in Denver, I met with Carolyn Reed. She owns six Silver Mine sub shops. She started her own business. She was working at UPS and decided she wanted to be a business owner, got her first franchise. Her and her husband mortgaged their house. Eventually, they got an SBA loan. Now, she\u2019s got six stores. A wonderful woman. And today, she decided to raise her hourly employees\u2019 wages to a minimum of $10.10 an hour. (Applause.) She just went ahead and did it on her own, because she realized that she\u2019ll have less turnover and she\u2019s going to have more productive workers.\n\nAs long as Congress will not increase wages for workers, I will go and talk to every business in America if I have to. (Applause.) There\u2019s no denying a simple truth: America deserves a raise, and if you work full-time in this country, you shouldn\u2019t live in poverty. That\u2019s something that we all believe. (Applause.)\n\nNow, here\u2019s where it gets interesting. There are a number of Republicans, including a number in the Texas delegation, who are mad at me for taking these actions. They actually plan to sue me. (Laughter.) Now, I don\u2019t know which things they find most offensive \u2014 me helping to create jobs, or me raising wages, or me easing the student loan burdens, or me making sure women can find out whether they\u2019re getting paid the same as men for doing the same job. I don\u2019t know which of these actions really bug them. (Laughter.)\n\nThe truth is, even with all the actions I\u2019ve taken this year, I\u2019m issuing executive orders at the lowest rate in more than 100 years. So it\u2019s not clear how it is that Republicans didn\u2019t seem to mind when President Bush took more executive actions than I did. (Applause.) Maybe it\u2019s just me they don\u2019t like. I don\u2019t know. Maybe there\u2019s some principle out there that I haven\u2019t discerned, that I haven\u2019t figure out. (Laughter.) You hear some of them \u2014 \u201csue him,\u201d \u201cimpeach him.\u201d Really? (Laughter.) Really? For what? (Applause.) You\u2019re going to sue me for doing my job? Okay. (Applause.)\n\nI mean, think about that. You\u2019re going to use taxpayer money to sue me for doing my job \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 while you don\u2019t do your job. (Applause.)\n\nThere\u2019s a great movie called \u201cThe Departed\u201d \u2014 a little violent for kids. But there\u2019s a scene in the movie where Mark Wahlberg \u2014 they\u2019re on a stakeout and somehow the guy loses the guy that they\u2019re tracking. And Wahlberg is all upset and yelling at the guy. And the guy looks up and he says, \u201cWell, who are you?\u201d And Wahlberg says, \u201cI\u2019m the guy doing my job. You must be the other guy.\u201d (Laughter and applause.) Sometimes, I feel like saying to these guys, I\u2019m the guy doing my job, you must be the other guy. (Applause.)\n\nSo rather than wage another political stunt that wastes time, wastes taxpayers\u2019 money, I\u2019ve got a better idea: Do something. (Applause.) If you\u2019re mad at me for helping people on my own, let\u2019s team up. Let\u2019s pass some bills. Let\u2019s help America together. (Applause.)\n\nIt is lonely, me just doing stuff. I\u2019d love if the Republicans did stuff, too. (Laughter.) On immigration issues, we\u2019ve got \u2014 and to their credit, there are some Republicans in the Senate who actually worked with Democrats, passed a bill, would strengthen the borders, would help make the system more fair and more just. But the House Republicans, they haven\u2019t even called the bill. They won\u2019t even take a vote on the bill. They don\u2019t have enough energy or organization or I don\u2019t know what to just even vote no on the bill. (Laughter.) And then they\u2019re made at me for trying to do some things to make the immigration system work better. So it doesn\u2019t make sense.\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.)\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: I\u2019m sorry, what are you yelling about now? Sit down, guys. I\u2019m almost done. Come on, sit down. I\u2019ll talk to you afterwards, I promise. I\u2019ll bring you back. I\u2019m wrapping things up here.\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.)\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: I understand. See, everybody is going to start \u2014 I\u2019m on your side, man. Sit down, guys, we\u2019ll talk about it later, I promise.\n\nSo, look, here\u2019s what we could do. We could do so much more \u2014 you don\u2019t have to escort them out. They\u2019ll sit down. I promise, I\u2019ll talk to you afterwards.\n\nWe could do so much more if Republicans in Congress would focus less on stacking the deck for those on the top and focus more on creating opportunity for everybody. And I want to work with them. I don\u2019t expect them to agree with me on everything, but at least agree with me on the things that you used to say you were for before I was for them. (Applause.)\n\nYou used to be for building roads and infrastructure. Nothing has changed. Let\u2019s go ahead and do it. (Applause.) Ronald Reagan passed immigration reform, and you love Ronald Reagan. Let\u2019s go ahead and do it. (Applause.)\n\nI mean, what changed? I\u2019m just saying. (Laughter.) That\u2019s what made our country great, a sense of common purpose, a sense we\u2019re all in it together as one nation, as one people. We can debate the issues, we can have our differences, but let\u2019s do something. (Applause.) Let\u2019s rally around an economic patriotism that says, instead of giving more tax breaks to millionaires, let\u2019s give tax breaks to working families to help pay for child care or college.\n\nInstead of protecting tax loopholes that let corporations keep their profits overseas, let\u2019s put some of that money to work right here in the United States rebuilding America. (Applause.) We can rebuild our airports, create the next generation of good manufacturing jobs, make sure those are made in America.\n\nLet\u2019s rally around a patriotism that says we\u2019re stronger as a nation when we cultivate the ingenuity and talent of every American, and give every 4-year-old in America access to high-quality education \u2014 good-quality preschool. (Applause.) Let\u2019s redesign our high schools to make them more relevant to the 21st century economy. Let\u2019s make college more affordable. Let\u2019s make sure every worker, if you lose your job, you can get a good job training that gives you an even better job. (Applause.)\n\nLet\u2019s embrace the patriotism that says it\u2019s a good thing when our fellow citizens have health care. It\u2019s not a bad thing. (Applause.) That\u2019s not a bad thing. It\u2019s a good thing when women earn what men do for the same work. That\u2019s an all-American principle. (Applause.) Everybody has got a mom out there or a wife out there or a daughter out there. They don\u2019t want them to not get treated fairly. Why would you be against that?\n\nIt\u2019s a good thing when parents can take a day off to care for a sick child without losing their job or losing pay and they can\u2019t pay their bills at the end of the month. It\u2019s a good thing when nobody who works full-time is living in poverty. That is not radical. It\u2019s not un-American. It\u2019s not socialist. That\u2019s how we built this country. It\u2019s what America is all about, us working together. (Applause.)\n\nSo let me just wrap up by saying this: The hardest thing to change in politics is a stubborn status quo. Our democracy is designed where folks who have power, who have clout \u2014 they can block stuff, they can keep things as they are. It\u2019s hard. It\u2019s even harder when Washington seems focused on everything but your concerns, Kinsey\u2019s concerns.\n\nThere are plenty of people who count on you getting cynical and count on you not getting involved so that you don\u2019t vote, so you give up. And you can\u2019t give into that. America is making progress, despite what the cynics say. (Applause.) Despite unyielding opposition and a Congress that can\u2019t seem to do anything, there are workers with jobs who didn\u2019t have them before; there are families with health insurance who didn\u2019t have them before; there are students in college who couldn\u2019t afford it before; there are troops who served tour after tour who are home with their families today. (Applause.)\n\nCynicism is popular. Cynicism is popular these days. It\u2019s what passes off as wisdom. But cynics didn\u2019t put a man on the moon. Cynics never won a war. Cynics didn\u2019t cure a disease, or start a business, or feed a young mind. Cynicism didn\u2019t bring about the right for women to vote, or the right for African Americans to be full citizens. Cynicism is a choice.\n\nHope is a better choice. Hope is what gave young soldiers the courage to storm a beach. Hope is what gave young people the strength to march for women\u2019s rights and civil rights and voting rights and gay rights and immigrant rights. (Applause.)\n\nHope is what compelled Kinsey to sit down and pick up a pen, and ask \u201cwhat can I do,\u201d and actually think maybe the President might read that story and it might make a difference. (Applause.) And her voice rang out here in the Paramount Theatre. And it\u2019s her voice and your voice that\u2019s going to change this country. That\u2019s how we\u2019re going to make sure that we remain the greatest nation on Earth \u2014 not by asking what we can do for ourselves, but what we can do for each other and what we can do for our country.\n\nAnd so, as President, I\u2019m going to keep a promise that I made when I first ran: Every day, I will keep asking the same question, and that is, how can I help you? And I\u2019ll keep treating your cares and your concerns as my own. And I will keep fighting to restore the American Dream for everybody who\u2019s willing to work for it.\n\nAnd I am going to need you to be right there with me. (Applause.) Do not get cynical. Hope is the better choice.\n\nThank you, Texas. Thank you, Austin. God bless you.
