Great news, Arizona.

Our leaders are marching ever closer to declaring our independence from the United States of America.

Or at least, from its government.

This afternoon, the Arizona House approved House Bill 2368, declaring that henceforth the sovereign state of Arizona will not enforce any executive orders issued by the president of the United States or any policy directives from the Department of Justice unless they are affirmed by Congress and signed into law.

The bill, sponsored by none other than Rep. Bob Thorpe, R-Flagstaff, is one of a series of kooky measures aimed at declaring our independence from federal gun laws, from the Affordable Care Act, from the Environmental Protection Agency, from the Department of Justice, from Barack Obama and from just about anything else associated with the state's most detested f-word.

Federal, that is.

Apparently, House Bill 2368 isn't even controversial. The only one to speak about it on the House floor, was Rep. Bruce Wheeler, D-Tucson, who noted that presidents throughout our nation's history have used executive orders.

He may as well as saved his breath.

The bill passed on a party line 36-24 vote.
