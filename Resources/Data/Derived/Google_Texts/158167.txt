Sioux Falls, SD

The Paint the Plows program had 29 schools and organizations add a little color to the blades of the Sioux Falls snowplows.

The plows were on displayed for the second straight year in the Empire Mall parking lot today. Each plow that has been painted will be clearing the streets around the area of the school that decorated it. The program has been such a success that cities from around the state are looking to adopt it.

“I'm starting to take calls of South Dakota from street managers around there trying to incorporate it into their city. I think it's been really well received. It's fun, we enjoy it and I see us continuing to do this,” Galynn Huber of the Sioux Falls Street Department said.

For people that want to see the work in action three of the plows will be on display during the parade of lights the Friday after Thanksgiving.
