Ted Cruz may be one of President Barack Obama\u2019s biggest detractors, but he is also an admirer of the president. The Texas Republican is a staunch opponent of anything Obama-related, but even he admitted the nation's chief executive is an admirable man.\n\nOn NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday, Cruz did not hold back on his views about recent U.S. Supreme Court decisions on same-sex marriage and the Affordable Care Act, both of which he called \u201can assault on democracy.\u201d He claimed that the court justices involved in both majority opinions had \u201cput on an Obama jersey\u201d and forced their rulings on 320 million Americans.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Cruz -- who has declared his candidacy for the GOP's presidential nomination in 2016, infamously spearheaded a nationwide campaign to discredit Obamacare and played a key role in leading a government shutdown in 2013 -- criticized the incumbent administration\u2019s policies. He said Obama\u2019s ideas are \u201cprofoundly dangerous,\u201d and are taking away jobs and opportunities from millions of Americans.\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\n\u201cBut I admire that he stands and fights for his principles,\u201d Cruz conceded. He admitted that although he doesn\u2019t believe in Obama\u2019s programs, he respects the president for his determination. \u201cI think he believes in all of his heart in his principles. I think he fights for them relentlessly, and if I were a leftist, I would love Barack Obama because he has advanced the left-wing progressive agenda more than any president in history.\u201d\n\nIn addition to running for president, the 44-year-old Cruz is promoting his new book \u201cA Time for Truth.\u201d In the same interview, he confessed he was an \u201carrogant little snob\u201d when he was young and applying for a position on George W. Bush\u2019s presidential campaign in 2000.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nHe wanted to be like Canadian actor Michael J. Fox in the 1995 political drama \u201cThe American President,\u201d but it became clear that he wasn\u2019t going to realize his dreams because he had burned too many bridges at that time. Fox played an assistant to the president (Michael Douglas) in the critically lauded film.\n\nAt the moment, Cruz\u2019s presidential chances appear to be slim. According to a Huffington Post poll of GOP candidates, he is in eighth place with support from 4.7 percent of likely voters, behind former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee. Businessman Donald Trump leads the Republican field, followed by former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. Cruz is also behind in CNN\u2019s poll, averaging support from just 3 percent of voters.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://s2.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "ted cruz, barack obama, texas, presidential campaign, a time for truth, the american president, gop, michael j. fox, the american president, same-sex marriage, obamacare", "og": {"site_name": "International Business Times", "description": "The Texas Republican said he disagrees with the president on policy, but still admires him.", "title": "President Barack Obama 'Fights For His Principles': US Sen Ted Cruz", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.com/president-barack-obama-fights-his-principles-us-sen-ted-cruz-1996398", "image": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2015/07/04/ted-cruz-unhrc.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Texas Republican said he disagrees with the president on policy, but still admires him.", "title": "President Barack Obama 'Fights For His Principles': US Sen Ted Cruz", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.com/president-barack-obama-fights-his-principles-us-sen-ted-cruz-1996398", "image": {"src": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2015/07/04/ted-cruz-unhrc.jpg", "identifier": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2015/07/04/ted-cruz-unhrc.jpg"}, "site": "@IBTimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "fb": {"app_id": 263851690471857, "pages": 128026713884051}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/IBTimes", "section": "World", "published_time": "2015-07-06T15:25:21-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-06T15:25:21-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The Texas Republican said he disagrees with the president on policy, but still admires him."}, "article_summary": "Photo: Getty Images\u201cBut I admire that he stands and fights for his principles,\u201d Cruz conceded.\nU.S. Sen.
