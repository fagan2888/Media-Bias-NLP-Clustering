But here is where the wonder of modern medicine comes in \u2014 even though his arm was so destroyed his hand could not be immediately attached, docs were able to come up with a smooth alternative. They simply sewed the hand onto the guy\u2019s ankle so that his leg\u2019s blood supply could keep it alive while they fixed his arm.\n\nAfter a month, they were able to successfully reattach his hand to his arm, WTKR reported. No word on whether he could move it while it was on his leg.\n\nDrug Giant Stops Paying Docs to Endorse Meds\n\nGlaxoSmithKline, a British drug maker, announced on Monday two groundbreaking decisions \u2014 they\u2019ll no longer pay doctors to endorse their drugs, and their sales reps will no longer be compensated based the number of prescriptions docs write, the New York Times reports. These changes, long called for by critics of the drug industry, is a first, but it may not be coming simply from Glaxo\u2019s desire to do right in the world. The company has been investigated for bribery in China, though the company\u2019s chief executive denied a connection. Another suspect cause of the change of heart? The companies have to make these payments public starting next year, thanks to the Affordable Care Act.\n\nWhatever the reason, medical experts are rejoicing at the news, and are hopeful that it could help prevent an onslaught of unnecessary medical prescriptions. Glaxo\u2019s decision, as one of the world\u2019s largest drug companies, may even motivate others to follow suit.\n\n\u201cAs a physician, I periodically meet with these sales reps and they usually come in armed with information about me that I don\u2019t even know,\u201d Raed Dweik, MD, of the Cleveland Clinic told the Times. \u201cI feel that\u2019s not really a comfortable interaction to have.\u201d\n\nJust Stop With the Vitamin Studies Already\n\nDo you take a daily multivitamin? Well, you might as well stop, according to recent research from Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, USA Today reports. The journal published two new studies on vitamins, along with an opinion piece arguing that because studies done on vitamins have consistently shown that they do not help and may in fact harm, it\u2019s time to throw in the towel \u2014 on vitamins and on research.\n\nThe research found that vitamins neither prevented cognitive decline nor did they have any effect on the progression of heart disease. But still, 53 percent of consumers pay $28 billion a year for their vitamins and supplements. Everyday Health will be discussing this in a #HealthTalk on Friday, from 3-4 pm, and you can check out our own list of what vitamins and supplements to skip here.\n\nSkip the Wine in Jail\n\nIn jail, a wine connoisseur is someone who\u2019s made something vaguely resembling the substance from juice and canned fruit, mixed together in a plastic bag and stored until it ferments. Unfortunately, for some inmates of a Utah prison, one of these guys decided to get a little fancy and add in a potato \u2014 isn\u2019t that where vodka comes from, after all? Unfortunately, in this circumstance, the potato addition lead to a nasty spread of botulism, an infection that causes the person to lose control of their muscles, ABC news reported.\n\n-Susan E.
