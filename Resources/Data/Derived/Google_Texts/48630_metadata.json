In fact, Galveston County is said to be one of the most solidly red counties in the State. The hard work of the county\u2019s Republicans was helped along by the anger towards the policies of President Barack Obama. Breitbart Texas previously reported on another blue Texas county that also became red.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nThe Reconstruction Era is the period of time that followed the Civil War. It ended in 1865. Democrats in Galveston County have dominated political offices since that time. The first Republican Constable was elected in the 1980\u2019s but he was the lone Republican in the county.\n\nIn the late 1990\u2019s, Ken Clark, won a Commissioner seat but the vote on Commissioner\u2019s Court was 4-1 for years. Although Republicans won a district court bench, and the County Treasurer seat in 2002, the first big GOP sweep was in 2010. Republicans who ran in 2006 lost by a margin of 48 to 50 percent. One of those Republicans was Barbara Meeks who ran for County Clerk. Meeks now serves as the Galveston County GOP Chair. Meeks was appointed to that position in 2011 when there was a vacancy.\n\nBreitbart Texas talked to Meeks about her work in Galveston County and the history of the county, and the recent victories there.\n\nIn 2010, the Galveston County GOP ran a candidate in every race with the exception of two district court seats. One of those benches was held by the County Democratic Party\u2019s daughter, Susan Criss. Because of the efforts of Republicans in the county, even Criss would have lost that year if she had been opposed. The Galveston County GOP had victories in the District Attorney, County Judge, District and County Clerk, and the judge races.\n\nMeeks told Breitbart Texas that \u201cObama helped in 2010 because people were disgusted nationally and in Galveston County.\u201d The GOP in the County had more money to spend on billboards and mailings and the demographics had changed since Hurricane Ike and September 2008. She attributes people\u2019s \u201canger with Obama and the terrific Republican candidates the GOP had in the County that year.\u201d\n\nIn 2010, Commissioner Ken Clark paid for one hundred 4\u2019 X 8\u2019 signs made of yellow plastic sporting red font. If the plastic and color selection were not attention-grabbing enough, they were hung portrait style and were 8\u2019 feet tall by 4\u2019 wide. The caption \u2013 \u201cStop Obama. Vote the R\u201d.\n\nMeeks said the candidates in 2010 \u201cran as a Pack\u201d and block-walked and did meet-and-greets every weekend starting in August. She said Galveston is a \u201cbedroom community\u201d and people do not have a lot of extra time on their hands. The GOP \u201ctook it where they are\u201d onto people\u2019s porches and driveways.\n\nMeeks \u201cwanted to keep the momentum\u201d in 2012. She said they continued to do meet-and-greets and to block walk, and this time they had money for three mailings for independents and \u201cweaker\u201d Republicans. A Republican Sheriff was elected and Commissioner\u2019s Court became a 4-1 GOP voting bloc. In less than six years, the Court had a complete 4-1 flip. Ken Clark had been the lone Republican Commissioner on Commissioner\u2019s Court for six years. The County GOP also picked up three district court benches, and all constables and justice of the peace races. Incumbent Congressman Nick Lampson was defeated by Randy Weber.\n\nAlthough Galveston County is only populated by 300,000 people, it has 8 constables and 9 justices of the peace. When asked about these numbers, Meeks says \u201cthis is symptomatic of what Democrats do.\u201d She contrasted Republicans in Galveston County who are \u201cdoing exactly what they were elected to do.\u201d She told Breitbart Texas that County Judge Mark Henry, and the Republicans on Commissioners Court, are \u201creducing the size of government, eliminating waste, and cutting the tax rate while increasing county services.\u201d Meeks told Breitbart Texas that there was a Tai-Chi instructor and a golf cart driver on the county payroll prior to Republicans taking control. Although it has not been without controversy, the number of justices of the peace and constables will be reduced by 50 percent after next year.\n\nRepublicans in Galveston County have done what they promised to do, and they swept county-wide in 2014. The County GOP reminded voters what they had done, and they contrasted it to the Obama administration. They urged voters to vote straight-ticket Republican.\n\nThe County Party put out signs and billboards with slogans of \u201cSave America, Vote Republican,\u201d and \u201cDefend Freedom, Vote Republican.\u201d Their sign \u201cStop Socialism, Vote Straight Republican\u201d is what caused this writer to call the County Chair. She said \u201cGovernment is invading in our daily lives and is expanding, everything that goes against Republican principles. This was a pretty strong message.\u201d\n\nThe biggest contest in the county in November was the HD23 race between Wayne Faircloth and Susan Criss of the Democrat Criss dynasty. Meeks told Breitbart Texas \u201cFaircloth ran in 2012 and he knew what he needed.\u201d The political breakdown in that district is close to 49.5 and 50.5, and Faircloth knew he needed 47 percent in the county. Senator Ted Cruz, the Republican Party of Texas, and others came out strong to support Faircloth. Faircloth carried Republican Chambers County in the upper 80 percent range and this helped him win by almost 3,000 votes.\n\nCommissioner Clark, whose district runs 72% Republican, won with almost 77% of the vote. Clark told Breitbart Texas \u201cIt has been rewarding what we have accomplished [in Galveston County], and it has been a fulfillment of a long-time dream.\u201d The Commissioner said it was difficult to find the words to really describe the feeling of accomplishment.\n\nThe Galveston County Chair said she and other Republicans in Galveston County \u201care not going to rest on our laurels.\u201d She said they are already thinking about 2016. They know they will engage in many of the same strategies, including block-walking.\n\nMeeks made sure to mention those before her who had worked against all odds to turn the Blue county Red. She talked about Kris Anne Vogelpohl.\n\nVogelpohl put up a lemonade and ice tea stand on the seawall promoting George Herbert Walker Bush in the 1960s. Meeks said Vogelpohl is probably the only resident in Galveston County who can say that a former President slept on her couch. Meeks said Vogelpohl had phone banks in her home when it was \u201cdangerous to do so.\u201d\n\nMeeks said it \u201ctook stalwart Republicans, and wonderful role models like Kris Anne Vogelpohl, and that kind of strength and determination to keep going.\u201d Meeks asked \u201chow do you keep that spirit going when you keep losing?\u201d\n\nMrs. Vogelpohl, Republicans in Galveston County and elsewhere would like to say thank you.\n\nLana Shadwick is a contributing writer and legal analyst for Breitbart Texas.
