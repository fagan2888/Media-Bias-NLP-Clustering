It\u2019s our responsibility to get that going.\u201d\n\nFlorida hired the former Alabama offensive coordinator and Colorado State head coach nicknamed \u201cMac\u201d on Thursday to get the Gators back to prominence \u2014 maybe even relevance \u2014 in the SEC East. His top priority is revamping an offense that has grown stagnant since former Heisman Trophy winner Tim Tebow left school in 2009.\n\nMcElwain declined to specify whether he plans to install a spread scheme, which he had success with at Colorado State and Fresno State, or a pro-style scheme, which he used to help get Alabama to the top of the league.\n\nHe also said no decisions have been made about whether to keep some of Florida\u2019s current staff. Speculation has centered on retaining defensive coordinator D.J. Durkin and recruiting ace Travaris Robinson.\n\nSo McElwain provided no real news Saturday, but drew plenty of laughs from a crowded room that included reporters, fans, boosters, his boss, university employees and his wife and three children.\n\n\u201cPeople like being around him,\u201d athletic director Jeremy Foley said. \u201cYou can see he\u2019s very comfortable, has a good sense of humor.\u201d\n\nThat was evident Saturday. Here are some of the highlights:\n\n\u2022 When asked to identify some of his offensive influences, McElwain responded, \u201cWho are you? Well, here\u2019s who I am: I\u2019m that dog that\u2019s dropped off down at the humane society and he has about a little bit of every breed in it, and whatever the situation is, you try to bring that breed out that helps success. \u2026\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not been one (offense) that I\u2019ve invented. All right? A lot of the guys in this business think they\u2019ve invented it. Right? It\u2019s been done.\u201d\n\n\u2022 When asked whether he wants to reinvent the \u201cFun \u2018n\u2019 Gun,\u201d the nickname given to former coach Steve Spurrier\u2019s high-scoring offense in the 1990s, he said, \u201cUm, I don\u2019t know what you call it, but it will be a blast.\u201d A few seconds later, he added, \u201cHow about the Humane Society?\u201d\n\n\u2022 When asked about his first recruiting trip to Florida, he stumbled to come up with the year and then eventually took a dig at his alma mater, Eastern Washington. \u201cI\u2019m not real good on math,\u201d he said. \u201cEastern Washington education. Sorry.\u201d\n\n\u2022 He took an even bigger jab at the Raiders, where he spent the 2006 season as quarterbacks coach. Coach Art Shell and his staff were fired after a 2-14 season.\n\n\u201cSome people would have said I didn\u2019t coach in the National Football League,\u201d he quipped. \u201cI coached with the Raiders. But I\u2019ve got to tell you what a great experience that was.\u201d\n\nThe Gators are counting on McElwain to provide a better experience than the Will Muschamp era and get back in the hunt in the East.\n\nFlorida went 28-21 under Muschamp, including 10-13 the past two seasons. The offense was the main problem, ranking no higher than 90th in total yards during Muschamp\u2019s four seasons.\n\nMuschamp failed repeatedly to improve things on that side of the ball despite three offensive coordinators, three offensive line coaches, four receivers coaches and a number of quarterbacks. Foley fired him Nov. 16 and identified McElwain as the top target a week later because of his head-coaching experience, ties to the SEC and the Sunshine State and his history of offensive success.\n\nMcElwain wanted the job so badly that he agreed to pay $2 million of a $5 million buyout. The Gators will pay the rest and also will guarantee Colorado State another $2 million for playing a game in Gainesville between 2017 and 2020.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s only a couple of these in the United States of America, and one of those is the Florida Gators, and to be able to have that opportunity is something I\u2019m not sure I could have lived with,\u201d said McElwain, who signed a six-year deal that will average $3.5 million annually. \u201cGiven that opportunity and letting it pass by, I\u2019m not one to ever let things pass by.\n\n\u201cI kind of roll up my sleeves and go get it done.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Florida introduces football coach Jim McElwain", "title": "Florida introduces football coach Jim McElwain", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/12/06/florida-introduces-football-coach-jim-mcelwain/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141206_021757_jim-mcelwain.jpg", "height": 467}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141206_021757_jim-mcelwain.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-06T14:15:52+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T10:55:43+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd72d8\"", "article_summary": "GAINESVILLE, Fla. \u2014 Florida coach Jim McElwain took playful shots at his alma mater, the Oakland Raiders and himself.\nHere are some of the highlights:\u2022 When asked to identify some of his offensive influences, McElwain responded, \u201cWho are you?\nSorry.\u201d\u2022 He took an even bigger jab at the Raiders, where he spent the 2006 season as quarterbacks coach.\nMcElwain wanted the job so badly that he agreed to pay $2 million of a $5 million buyout.\n\u201cSome people would have said I didn\u2019t coach in the National Football League,\u201d he quipped."}
