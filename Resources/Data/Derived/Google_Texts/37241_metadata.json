Chuck Schumer are the two most influential Democratic voices on Capitol Hill.\n\nThey find themselves on opposite sides when it comes to support for President Obama\u2019s Iran deal. Pelosi backs the accord. Schumer announced -- during Fox News Channel\u2019s prime-time GOP presidential debate -- that he would oppose the agreement.\n\nAnd regardless of where Pelosi, California, and Schumer, New York, stand on Iran, that might not make any difference to rank-and-file lawmakers struggling with their decision.\n\nThat\u2019s because these sorts of votes are special to lawmakers. They are legacy votes. And often, a lawmaker simply has to come to terms with which way to go on their own. They look inside themselves. They seek counsel. They pray. And then they vote.\n\nAt the end of the day, it\u2019s just about them.\n\nNot only are Pelosi and Schumer the most prominent figures in the House and Senate Democratic caucuses, but they are both the odds-on favorites to be the Democrats\u2019 top leaders on Capitol Hill when the 115th Congress convenes in January 2017 -- whether Democrats hold the majority or minority in either body.\n\nPelosi\u2019s served as minority leader or House speaker since 2003. The retirement of Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid thrust Schumer to the top of the ladder as the heir apparent to the Nevada Democrat.\n\nSchumer seemingly vaulted Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., for the post. Schumer has deeper ties to rank-and-file Democratic members and is a prolific fundraiser.\n\nBut that didn\u2019t stop allies of President Obama and other Democratic activists from lighting up Schumer, questioning whether his opposition may be a disqualifying factor for him to emerge as the Senate\u2019s leading Democrat.\n\n\u201cSenator Schumer siding with the GOP against Obama, Clinton, and most Democrats will make it hard for him to lead the Dems in '16,\u201d brutally tweeted former longtime, senior White House adviser Dan Pfeiffer. \u201cThe base won't support a leader who thought Obamacare was a mistake and wants War with Iran.\u201d\n\nFormer Obama speechwriter Jon Favreau tweeted: \u201cThis is our next Senate leader?\u201d\n\nAnd then this sidewinder missile from MoveOn.org Political Action Executive Director Ilya Sheyman.\n\n\u201cOur country doesn\u2019t need another Joe Lieberman in the Senate, and it certainly doesn\u2019t need him as Democratic leader,\u201d said Sheyman. \u201cNo real Democratic leader does this.\u201d\n\nSheyman\u2019s remark references former Independent Connecticut Sen. Joe Lieberman, who lost the Democratic primary in 2006, sided with GOPers on many issues, endorsed Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., for president in 2008, spoke at the Republican convention that year and came close to getting kicked out of the Senate Democratic Caucus.\n\nIs this enough to imperil Schumer\u2019s otherwise unchallenged bid to succeed Reid? Hard to say. Lots of time between now and that closed-door Democratic Caucus meeting just before Thanksgiving in November 2016.\n\nAfter Reid announced his intention to retire, Schumer worked the phones and lined-up the necessary support to follow Reid within hours. Durbin certainly had interest but not the votes and wound up publicly backing Schumer for the gig. There are quarters of the Democratic Party that would like to see a woman in leadership, such as Sens. Patty Murray, Washington, and Elizabeth Warren, Massachusetts.\n\nLiberals in the party would rejoice seeing Warren matriculate.\n\nLeadership elections are often determined by what we\u2019ll call \u201cparticle politics,\u201d a series of small, infinitesimal factors at the subatomic political level.\n\nA failure to support the Iran nuclear deal could develop as a contributing factor that moves the political electrons and protons when selecting the next Senate Democratic leader. Most importantly, there\u2019s a lot of time between now and November of 2016. The nation will have already taken its vote for president before Senate Democrats huddle to choose Reid\u2019s successor the fall after next.\n\nWhen asked if Schumer\u2019s defection could cast a pall on his leadership prospects, White House spokesman Josh Earnest noted it \u201cis a question for Democratic senators.\u201d\n\nHe added that the administration wouldn\u2019t weigh-in on a leadership election. But Earnest cryptically added he \u201cwouldn\u2019t be surprised if members of the Democratic caucus would consider (Schumer\u2019s) voting record.\n\nSchumer was part of the 98-0 vote in 2001 that launched the U.S. war in Afghanistan following 9/11.\n\nBut more notably, Schumer was one of 77 \u201cyeas\u201d on the October 2002 roll call vote that authorized the war in Iraq. That particular vote for war has grown more toxic by the year -- infuriating the left and surfacing as an argument against Hillary Clinton\u2019s fitness to become the potential Democratic flag bearer in 2016.\n\nMany lawmakers of both parties now regret that vote - considering the morass that swallowed Iraq and the creation of ISIL.\n\nDurbin and Murray were \u201cnoes\u201d on the 2002 Iraq vote. Warren didn\u2019t join the Senate until 2013.\n\nNow back to the macro politics of the Iran deal and what Schumer\u2019s decision means for congressional Democrats.\n\nSome may perceive Schumer\u2019s maneuver as an effort to provide air cover for Democrats who want to buck the deal. In other words, if one of the most-powerful Democrats in Congress is a no, then they can oppose Obama too and face few repercussions.\n\nCertainly that phenomenon played out when just moments after Schumer\u2019s declaration, New York Rep. Eliot Engel, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, also announced his opposition.\n\nBut don\u2019t read too much into this idea of Schumer running interference. Schumer was skeptical of the agreement from the start. He\u2019s a Jewish, a New York Democrat from Brooklyn with a large Jewish constituency and is a staunch supporter of Israel.\n\nHis decision to buck Obama on Iran is newsworthy, but not a surprise.\n\nThe same with Engel. He\u2019s long expressed reservations about the Iran package. And again, like Schumer, Engel is a Jewish, a New York Democrat who represents lots of Jewish voters and a longtime ally of Israel.\n\nAnd other pro-Israel lawmakers with substantial Jewish voting blocs didn\u2019t require Schumer\u2019s inter-positioning to announce their opposition, too.\n\nRep. Steve Israel (D-NY) is the top-ranking Jewish lawmaker in the House, a member of the leadership and a lieutenant of Pelosi\u2019s. He announced this week he\u2019s opposed. Same with New York Rep. Nita Lowey, the top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee.\n\nRep. Ted Deutch, D-Fla., followed suit. New York Democratic Reps. Grace Meng and Kathleen Rice will not support the president in this venture, either.\n\nWhile Republicans are in lockstep in opposition to the agreement, Democrats are all over the map. Does this signal an ebb in support for Obama? Remember the president flopped earlier this year when he tried to convince Democrats to back a framework for a major trade treaty with 12 Asian nations.\n\nObama made extraordinary personal entreaties with lawmakers at the Capitol and the congressional baseball game on the eve of one vote -- only to suffer defeat.\n\nHe later succeeded.\n\nIt\u2019s practically a foregone conclusion that both bodies of Congress will command the votes to reject the Iran pact and the president will veto that measure. What\u2019s unclear is whether at least one body of Congress can sustain a veto. Overriding a veto requires a two-thirds vote of both houses of Congress -- 290 votes in the 435-seat House and 67 votes in the 100-seat Senate. A failure to override the veto means Congress didn\u2019t demonstrate the sufficient legislative resolve to halt the package. The deal then goes through.\n\nBut overriding Obama\u2019s veto would be an embarrassment of incalculable dimension on the world stage. The handicapping now is that the president\u2019s firewall guarding against a veto override should hold. But it might be close.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not particularly surprising,\u201d said Earnest of Schumer\u2019s decision, also calling it \u201cdisappointing.\u201d But Earnest didn\u2019t think Schumer\u2019s position would prevent Obama from mobilizing support to sustain the veto.\n\nTwo weeks ago, New York Rep. Jerry Nadler huddled with the president for about a half-hour prior to a session with him and fellow House Democrats about the Iran proposal. Nadler said Obama warned them about the potential geopolitical implications of rejecting the plan.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to greatly lessen our credibility in dealing with anything in the future because people are going to say for a long time: \u2018You can\u2019t deal with (Washington) because who knows what they\u2019re going to do.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThat argument will resonate with some Democrats. The question remains will it be enough.\n\nAnd that\u2019s where Pelosi comes in.\n\nRemember it was Pelosi -- who for good or ill -- engineered passage of The Affordable Care Act. Detractors may call it \u201cObamaCare.\u201d But it was Pelosi\u2019s acumen and pinpoint vote-counting that lugged that measure to passage in the House.\n\nThe nascent congressional leadership may be split now on this issue. Schumer one way. Pelosi the other. Earlier this year, Pelosi cast votes against the international trade agreement, bringing scores of Democrats with her to rebuff the administration\u2019s desires. Pelosi could ultimately take the helm on this one for the administration.\n\nBut it might not make any difference.\n\nThe votes for or against the Iran deal are likely the most-pivotal decisions in Congress since the vote to raise the debt ceiling in the summer of 2011. It\u2019s right up there with the financial rescue package in the fall of 2008. It will rival the vote to go to war in Iraq in 2002.\n\nThese are votes of conscience. They\u2019re very personal. And sometimes it doesn\u2019t matter who says what to lawmakers about how they should vote. They\u2019re the only ones with a voting card. They just have to get to yes or no on their own.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.modified": "2015-08-08 11:56:14 EDT", "dcterms.abstract": "House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Sen.
