Kennedy Special Warfare School at Fort Bragg is a mentally and physically demanding field exercise called \u201cRobin Sage.\u201d\n\nThe student \u201calpha teams\u201d are inserted (by parachute, mule, helicopter or on foot) in the North Carolina pine forest to reach a mock guerrilla\u201d camp. Their mission is to earn the guerrillas\u2019 trust and begin to train them in our ways of war.\n\nAt some point, each team is faced with being compelled by circumstance or ordered to participate in a war crime. The few who do never get a green beret. Donald Trump couldn\u2019t pass that test.\n\nBefore the Dec. 15 debate, Mr. Trump said, \u201cThe other thing with the terrorists is you have to take out their families, when you get these terrorists, you have to take out their families. They care about their lives, don\u2019t kid yourself. When they say they don\u2019t care about their lives, you have to take out their families.\u201d He said it again during the debate, so it wasn\u2019t a slip of the tongue.\n\nThere\u2019s a fundamental problem with Mr. Trump\u2019s idea: What he advocated \u2014 twice \u2014 would be a war crime. The intentional killing of noncombatants obviously violates the Geneva Conventions and the Uniform Code of Military Justice. If any U.S. soldier \u2014 officer or enlisted \u2014 were ordered to do it he or she would be duty-bound and legally required to refuse to obey.\n\nMilitary orders that require a violation of U.S. laws or treaties such as the Geneva Conventions are illegal. Soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines are trained to know where they \u2014 personally \u2014 have to draw the line between a legal order and an illegal one. What Mr. Trump said obviously crosses the line and disqualifies him from being commander in chief.\n\nThough it\u2019s easy to see that Mr. Trump\u2019s idea is far beyond the pale, there are other less-obvious instances of illegal orders. President Obama is intent on emptying the terrorist detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, in order to close it. In his year-end press conference he promised to present a plan to close Gitmo to Congress and hinted that he would take executive action if congress fails authorize his plan.\n\nOn Nov. 23, Republican Rep. Mike Pompeo of Kansas and 15 other members of the House wrote to the Joint Chiefs of Staff concerning Mr. Obama\u2019s possible action. The letter said that if Mr. Obama were to order the transfer of any Gitmo inmates to prisons in the United States, that action would conflict with U.S. law, and the president\u2019s orders would thus be illegal.\n\nFor several years, the National Defense Authorization Act has prohibited the president from transferring any Gitmo inmates to any prison in the United States. Last month, U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch admitted to the House Judiciary Committee that transferring Gitmo inmates to U.S. prisons would violate the ban. The new National Defense Authorization Act for 2016, signed by Mr. Obama, continues the ban and extends the restrictions on where the inmates can be sent abroad.\n\nMr. Pompeo\u2019s letter points out that Mr. Obama has previously tried to transfer Gitmo inmates to prisons in Illinois and Michigan. The 16 congressmen who signed it write, perhaps too mildly, that if Mr. Obama orders any Gitmo inmate transferred to the United States under his new plan, the order would be illegal. Putting the Joint Chiefs on notice may appear redundant, but remember that the five Taliban leaders swapped for Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl were released in violation of the law which, at the time, required that Congress be notified 30 days in advance of any such release.\n\nTransferring Gitmo inmates to America wouldn\u2019t be as serious as a war crime, but it would be a violation of the law. Any officer who, despite the law, ordered his subordinates to follow an Obama order to transfer the terrorists to U.S. prisons would be guilty of obeying an illegal order and would be subject to court martial.\n\nEven if that were not the case, the Joint Chiefs must realize that the president\u2019s rationale for closing Gitmo is entirely spurious.\n\nBefore he was president, and on many occasions since he was elected, Mr. Obama had insisted that America had to close Gitmo. He has claimed that Gitmo robs our war efforts of legitimacy. He says that Gitmo is a danger to our national security because it is a symbol of American misdeeds that helps terrorist networks like al Qaeda and ISIS to recruit their jihadists.\n\nThe simple truth is that it doesn\u2019t matter where we imprison terrorists: Those still at large \u2014 and the left\u2019s anti-anti-terrorists \u2014 will continue to insist on Mr. Obama\u2019s narrative. They will never be satisfied until we hold no terrorist prisoners anywhere for any length of time.\n\nGitmo should not just be kept open. Its population should be increased by every terrorist we capture. They should be held there as long as we need to so we can milk them for whatever intelligence information may be in their heads and for as long as it may take to ensure they\u2019re no longer a danger to us. Too many \u2014 roughly 30 percent \u2014 of those released from Gitmo have either been confirmed to have returned to terrorism or are suspected of having done so.\n\nIf Mr. Obama orders the military to move Gitmo\u2019s inmates to U.S. prisons, the order will be illegal and \u2014 under the law \u2014 must be disobeyed.\n\n\u2022 Jed Babbin served as a deputy undersecretary of defense in the George H.W.
