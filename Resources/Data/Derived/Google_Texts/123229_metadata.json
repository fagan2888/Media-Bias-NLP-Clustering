Some have suggested a \"quadruple aim\" with physician job satisfaction as the fourth target. To kick off the Health is Primary city tour in Seattle on March 19, the group brought together family physicians in private practice and from academia to discuss how they are helping revolutionize health care delivery in the state of Washington. The tour is scheduled to visit Raleigh, N.C., on April 16, Chicago on May 19, Denver on Oct. 2 and Detroit on Oct. 21. \"Family Medicine for America's Health has come together with one mission: to improve health in America,\" said Glen Stream, M.D., board chair for the group. \"Our nation is facing a health crisis. We have the most expensive health care system in the world, yet we rank almost last in industrial countries in the health of our people. We believe the solution to many, if not all, of our health care problems can be found in primary care.\"\n\nStory highlights The Health is Primary city tour kicked off in Seattle March 19 featuring family physicians discussing how they are revolutionizing health care in the state of Washington.\n\n\n\nThe roundtable event asked panelists about their successes with direct primary care, integrated care teams, innovative payment solutions, reaching underserved populations and expanding the family medicine pipeline.\n\n\n\nPanelist Thomas Norris, M.D., chair of the University of Washington Department of Family Medicine, said there are encouraging signs across the country of efforts to improve primary care recruitment.\n\n\n\nThe roundtable event was moderated by author, documentary filmmaker and reporter T.R. Reid, who asked panel members to discuss their successes in areas including direct primary care, integrated care teams, innovative payment solutions, reaching underserved populations and expanding the family medicine pipeline.\n\nPatient-centered Care Panelist Erika Bliss, M.D., president and CEO of Qliance, a health care group that uses the direct primary care model, said her cousin and Qliance founder Garrison Bliss, M.D., had become discouraged by the fee-for-service, insurance-based system that drove him to see more patients with less value placed on the physician-patient relationship. So he started a practice charging a flat monthly fee and stopped billing insurance. He then was able to see a smaller number of patients and more intensively address their needs.\n\nSeven years later, he launched Qliance as a way to spread the model across the country. The goal was to focus on the triple aim, and even the quadruple aim. Bliss, speaking on the panel, said patients have responded dramatically to that approach. \"They say, 'Wow, I can't believe how well my provider listened to me or how much time and attention they spent to help me.'\" Bliss said people don't want to be sick but they don't want health care, either. \"They don't want what we have to offer, but they need it,\" she said. \"So we start with, 'If I was going to do something I didn't want to do, wouldn't I want it to be a pleasant, comforting experience?' That is what we have focused on as our primary foundation.\"\n\nPanelist Erika Bliss, M.D., (right) president and CEO of Qliance, said her cousin Garrison Bliss, M.D., founded the company after becoming discouraged by the fee-for-service, insurance-based system. He started a practice that charged a flat monthly fee and stopped billing insurance.\n\nSince October, panelist Carroll Haymon, M.D., has been the medical director at a clinic for Iora Primary Care that serves a patient population that is age 65 or older and on Medicare. One reason she moved from a previous job as a residency director was that her students were taking jobs and then calling her to express frustration in their new positions. Students would say, \"I can't get a job where I can provide care to the level that I should be offering,\" she said. She thought she could create a clinic where those students could practice after their residency and find deep satisfaction while providing a high level of patient care. Patient-centered care at Haymon's practice means promoting a culture of service, she said, which led the staff to read up on service industry best practices to provide \"deep, abiding service\" to their patients. She called it \"restoring humanity to health care.\" \"Patients are not a list of problems; they are individual human beings who are complicated,\" Haymon said. \"They need time, energy of devotion and love from us.\" She said to achieve that level of service, the facility built a health care team including nurses, social workers and \"health coaches.\" And sometimes the physician isn't the best provider of service to patients. \"Patients don't always need medical care,\" she said. \"They might need someone to sit down and help them fill out their Medicare application. That is patient centered.\"\n\n\n\nPatient-centered integrated care includes behavioral health, said panelist Russell Maier, M.D., director of the Central Washington Family Medicine Residency program, which trains doctors at a federally qualified health center to eventually practice in rural and other underserved areas. Within the past year, Maier said, the group of four clinics has gone from one part-time behavioral health provider to six full-time positions and also added community health workers. Following that change in care model, data showed a 10-percent drop in the number of patients the clinics sent to hospitals for in-patient care, he added. Return on Investment Iora Primary Care does not use a fee-for-service model. That means payer partners must share the organization's mission to properly fund primary care and let the team do its work, which leads to an overall reduction in health care costs, Haymon said. \"My feeling is if we can show the payers that health care savings can happen for our older adult/Medicare patients who are poorly served by the current system -- now, we're playing ball,\" she said. Bliss at Qliance said that working with Medicaid on direct primary care payment finally dispelled the myths about concierge medicine -- \"That we were only out for our own best interests and didn't care about the public,\" she said. \"We're now getting calls from other payers saying, 'This sounds interesting' and, 'We are interested in working with you.'\"\n\nPanelist Richard Kovar, M.D., (left) medical director for Country Doctor Community Health Centers, said, \"I truly believe that health disparities are at the heart of every family physician in this country. It is what we do; it is what we went into this professional for.\"", "article_metadata": {"category": "AAFP News", "description": "The Health is Primary city tour from Family Medicine for America's Health kicked off in Seattle March 19 with family physicians discussing how they are revolutionizing health care in Washington State.", "pubdate": "2015-03-23", "author": "Chris Crawford", "og": {"image": "http://www.aafp.org/content/dam/AAFP/images/logos_internal/og/AAFP-capital-RGB2_1024x512B.png", "description": "The Health is Primary city tour from Family Medicine for America's Health kicked off in Seattle March 19 with family physicians discussing how they are revolutionizing health care in Washington State.", "title": "Health is Primary Tour Kickoff Highlights Washington State Innovators"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.aafp.org/content/dam/AAFP/images/ann/2015-March/nc-Health%20is%20Pimary_General.jpg", "description": "The Health is Primary city tour from Family Medicine for America's Health kicked off in Seattle March 19 with family physicians discussing how they are revolutionizing health care in Washington State.", "site": "@aafp", "card": "summary", "title": "Health is Primary Tour Kickoff Highlights Washington State Innovators"}, "lastreviewdate": "2015-03-23", "news-category": "Practice & Professional Issues", "nav-title": "Health is Primary Tour Kickoff Highlights Washington State Innovators", "image": "http://www.aafp.org/content/dam/AAFP/images/ann/2015-March/nc-Health%20is%20Pimary_General.jpg.daijpg.90.jpg", "keywords": "Health is Primary, Family Medicine for America's Health, direct primary care, integrated care, payment, students", "content-type": "news-article", "archive": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "subcategory": "Practice & Professional Issues"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3f29\"", "article_summary": "We believe the solution to many, if not all, of our health care problems can be found in primary care.\"\nStory highlights The Health is Primary city tour kicked off in Seattle March 19 featuring family physicians discussing how they are revolutionizing health care in the state of Washington.\nWe have the most expensive health care system in the world, yet we rank almost last in industrial countries in the health of our people.\nShe said to achieve that level of service, the facility built a health care team including nurses, social workers and \"health coaches.\"\nThe Health is Primary city tour kicked off in Seattle March 19 with family physicians in private practice and from academia discussing how they are revolutionizing health care in Washington state."}
