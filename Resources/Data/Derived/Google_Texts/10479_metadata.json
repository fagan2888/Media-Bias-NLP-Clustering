Some have evolved to emphasize their weaponry, such as antlers or canine teeth, to fight off other males, while other species possess qualities that allow them to fertilize the most eggs \u2014 big testes and a high sperm count. A new study finds the traits male animals develop depend on the level of male-to-male competition for the females among them and also how easily each male can dominate a female in order to continue mating. \u201cUnderstanding the ways animals reproduce is important as it helps us understand how species evolve and can prove important for conservation,\u201d said Syracuse University's Dr. Stefan L\u00fcpold, a co-author of the study, which appears in Nature Communications.\n\nSexual Competition\n\nMale animals are faced with a decision that can make or break their chances at reproducing and thus surviving: Does it pay to be a lover or a fighter? The answer to this question occurs primarily on a species level and has evolved over time, with males of each species having developed the traits that help them fight off other males or conversely traits that help them spread their sperm. In an effort to understand this more deeply, a team of researchers from the University of Manchester, Syracuse University, and the University of Western Australia analyzed the sexual behaviors of over 300 species of males, including mammals, birds, fish, insects, and flatworms. \u201cWe set out to see why some species show trade-offs in sexual traits and others do not,\u201d said John Fitzpatrick, a lecturer in animal evolution at the University of Manchester and senior author of the research.\n\nIt is well known, for instance, that some animals appear to invest maximally in \u201cexpensive\u201d sexual traits, while others are more frugal. (Sexual traits are deemed expensive because personal, immediate survival often requires fighting off predators so it always pays, so to speak, to put more time into developing armor.) \u201cWe know animals try to get females in a couple of ways. When they fight for them they sometimes evolve weaponry \u2014 such as antlers or a really big body size or big teeth,\u201d Fitzgerald explained in a press release. Other animals though, don\u2019t seem to bother with any pre-copulation battles; instead, they simply attempt to fertilize the most eggs. What scientists don\u2019t know is why different species choose different paths.\n\nAfter analyzing their research, the team discovered that the males traded-off an investment in weaponry only when they were sure their females wouldn\u2019t fool around with another male behind their backs. The main driver, then, for how males evolved was the ability to dominate a female for continued mating. Elephant seals, for example, appear to have discovered that fighting for the right to mate brings greater control of the females so they invest more in weapons and less in testes size. Males are almost five times the size of the females, so they easily dominate their partners.\n\n\u201cIt is quite costly to invest in everything,\u201d L\u00fcpold explained. \u201cYou don\u2019t get something for nothing in evolution, so we wanted to see which species invested in weapons over testes.\u201d Yet some species do invest in both. In those species, fighting is not just the first step in sexual relations; they must also fight after mating. These species also show large testes and a high sperm count. Pheasants, minnows, and bush crickets, for example, all display traits that help them fight as well as love. The researchers remain mystified as to why some species invest in both, nevertheless they are continuing along the trail. \"We will now look at whether maximising investment in sexual traits means you pay the price in some other aspect of life,\u201d Lupold stated. Perhaps the human species might be included in that study.\n\nSource: Lupold S, Tomkins JL, Simmons LW, Fitzpatrick JL.
