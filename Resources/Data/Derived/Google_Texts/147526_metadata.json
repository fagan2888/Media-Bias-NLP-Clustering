Once enrolled, their health plan covers basic care \u2013 doctor\u2019s visits, physicals and hospital stays. The average cost for health insurance is $80 a month.\n\n\u201cThe great news in North Carolina is that 93 percent of the people that enrolled get that financial assistance to help pay for it,\u201d Metzguer said.\n\nFor Montoya, he says having health insurance gives him peace of mind while doing \u201chard, hot\u201d work.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;polling-uri=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=1;polling-uri2=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=2;polling-uri3=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=3;polling-uri4=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=4;polling-uri5=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=5;cycle=1", "dcterms.created": "2015-07-12 18:52:00", "description": "Migrant workers were able to sign up for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act at an event in Dunn on Sunday.", "application-name": "WRAL.com", "dcterms.modified": "2015-07-12 22:21:36", "outbrain": {"ob_desc": "id_asset=14769136|asset_type=story"}, "twitter": {"description": "Migrant workers were able to sign up for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act at an event in Dunn on Sunday.", "title": "ACA event helps migrant workers sign up for health insurance :: WRAL.com", "url": "http://www.wral.com/aca-event-helps-migrant-workers-sign-up-for-health-insurance/14769136/", "image": "http://wwwcache.wral.com/asset/news/state/nccapitol/2013/02/27/12161579/12161579-1436754013-160x120.jpg", "site": "@wral", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#041E30", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "robots": "index,follow", "pinterest": "nohover", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/favicons/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"app_id": 334167666672300}, "author": "WRAL", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-12T18:52:00-04:00"}, "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "og": {"site_name": "WRAL.com", "description": "Migrant workers were able to sign up for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act at an event in Dunn on Sunday.", "title": "ACA event helps migrant workers sign up for health insurance :: WRAL.com", "url": "http://www.wral.com/aca-event-helps-migrant-workers-sign-up-for-health-insurance/14769136/", "image": "http://wwwcache.wral.com/asset/news/state/nccapitol/2013/02/27/12161579/4022-bruce1-720x540.jpg", "type": "article"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msapplication-TileImage": "/favicons/mstile-144x144.png"}, "article_summary": "The average cost for health insurance is $80 a month.\nFor Montoya, he says having health insurance gives him peace of mind while doing \u201chard, hot\u201d work.\nWorkers must sign up within 60 days of arriving in North Carolina.\nThough the ACA open enrollment period has passed, those experiencing certain life events \u2013 including marriage, moving or a change in immigration status \u2013 may be eligible for a special enrollment period.\nThose like Montoya, who enter the United States on an agricultural work visa, are eligible under the special enrollment period."}
