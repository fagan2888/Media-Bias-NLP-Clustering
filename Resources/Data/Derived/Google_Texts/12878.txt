A strong community spirit often comes through the work of Longmont artist Linda Gleitz.

Several years ago, the downtown gallery Rabid Rabits Galeria displayed an integrated set of Gleitz paintings that came together to form the image of a swallow. The pieces were sent off with various patrons who agreed to send them back after a year, when they would be joined together again in a new exhibit. The mechanics of the work, inspired by the migrating cliff swallows of the famous mission of San Juan Capistrano, depended not just on Gleitz as the artist but on a set of participants.

Gleitz is back with "Capistrano III," a follow-up to her previous "Capistrano" projects, which also requires the involvement of multiple people. The community spirit of the work is reinforced by its permanent placement at the Salud Family Health Center, whose mission is to improve access to health care to all members of the community.

The work is a series of painted birds hanging from the ceiling in the medical area of the Salud facility at 220 E. Rogers Road. It was partly inspired by cut-outs that Gleitz saw her friend, Longmont artist Stephanie Hilvitz, create a couple years ago, Gleitz said. She cut out bird shapes and invited other artists to paint them.

"I was looking for a project specifically to collaborate on with other artists," Gleitz said in an email. "I wanted each artist to bring his/her own unique vision to the shape of the bird. They turned out pretty fabulous."

The other artists included Louis Trujillo, Paula Peacock, Ana Maria Botero, Tracy Russell, Deedee Hampton and Shelley Saxton.

The work was supported by a grant from the Longmont Council for the Arts.
