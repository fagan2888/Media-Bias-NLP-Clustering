There's an on-air feud brewing, and it looks like it just got turned up a notch.

Ed Schultz cranked up the heat on his current feud with Fox News host Sean Hannity on Monday, a week after Hannity rejected Schultz's offer to an on-air debate about Obamacare. In his response statement, Hannity called Schultz a "total buffoon" and wrote, "I really have better things to do with my time."

“While I understand little Eddie desperately needs attention, he unfortunately does not have the intelligence, wit, humor or debating skills," Hannity said.

But on Monday's segment of "Pretenders," the MSNBC host immediately called Hannity's bluff, claiming that he "doesn't have the guts to go head to head" in an on-air debate.

"Now he says he doesn't have any time for me, yet he sure as hell loves playing me on his show," Schultz said.

Schultz also made sure to show Hannity just how much "wit" and "humor" he really has, featuring Hannity dressed as a cowardly lion and referring to him as "The Cowardly Liar."

"Hannity claims that I’m looking for attention? Excuse me? I’ve been in this business for 35 years. I’ve got all the attention I want,” Schultz said. "Hannity uses his TV show as a means to twist the facts about Obamacare because he hates the president. If Sean Hannity wants to pretend he’s not a coward on debating me or correcting his mistakes, he can keep on pretending."
