It creates an in-store experience that drives traffic and consumer loyalty, while delivering incremental sales to the top line.\n\n\n\nOn Sunday GMDC provided the how.\n\n\n\nDuring Sunday\u2019s Business Session here at GMDC Health Beauty Wellness 2015, GMDC announced an investment the association has made on behalf of its members, subsidizing the cost of a crucial analytics tool provided through RetailNet Group that sets the stage for the kind of collaborative conversations that J&J and Wakefern presented.\n\n\n\n\u201cGMDC is subsidizing for all of our members an opportunity to acquire these really profound and compelling insights at a fraction of the typical price you would pay for an RNG subscription,\u201d noted Patrick Spear, GMDC president and CEO. \u201cSimply put, we value it enough that we\u2019re investing on your behalf. This data enables the opportunity to create a comprehensive deep-dive in support of customer meetings.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe new GMDC/RNG Insights Portal provides GMDC members three perspectives that will enhance conversations between suppliers and their retail partners. \u201cThis is just a really useful framework to help organize the thinking around: Where are the changes happening in retail? What are the major drivers outside of my business that I have to consider as I walk in and have to build plans?\u201d Michael Rogosa, director client services at RNG, said. \u201cThe first step is understanding what\u2019s going on with their business and does your product help them tell a better story?\u201d\n\n\n\nThose three perspectives include:\n\nRetailer planning and competitor analysis. Members can align with trends impacting retailers and their strategic initiatives, and forecast growth \u2014 sales, stores, comps.\n\nMembers can align with trends impacting retailers and their strategic initiatives, and forecast growth \u2014 sales, stores, comps. Initiative/trend exploration, which explains the trend, impact on shoppers and what retailers are doing to respond.\n\nwhich explains the trend, impact on shoppers and what retailers are doing to respond. Market planning and opportunity analysis. Members can use this tool to understand the biggest trends happening and identify where to align assets \u2014 winning channels and retailers.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s really what our Insights Portal is designed to do,\u201d Rogosa said. \u201cIt is to help both brands and retailers, and wholesalers as well, understand where the growth is coming from. How do I better partner? Where should I align my assets? And then what are those major drivers, major capabilities, that I need to invest in?\u201d\n\n\n\nRNG\u2019s Insights Panel reaches beyond both the U.S. and Canadian retail theaters and into 180 countries worldwide, Rogosa said, and not only provides insights into categories across the entire front-end, but also across the entire spectrum of retail channels. \u201cThat includes the largest collection and information set about digital e-commerce as well,\u201d Rogosa added.\n\n\n\nAll told, RNG\u2019s full offering includes a full bank of photos of retail prototypes across the world delineated by geographic location, retail channel, product category and merchandising trend. Also there are in-depth profiles of each retailer that provides a snapshot into what\u2019s driving their business and where they\u2019re headed strategically. And there is category data that can feed analysis on the front-end trends impacting retail.\n\n\n\n\u201cData is power. More information is better than less,\u201d Spear added. \u201cIf you\u2019re a first-time attendee here and you want to punch above your weight class, there\u2019s probably an opportunity within the Insights Portal. If you\u2019re managing a global brand, but you\u2019re not getting the actionable insights you need to help you prepare for your meetings around the world or whatever country you\u2019re operating in, perhaps this is the way to do it.\u201d\n\n\n\nSpear closed with a no-risk offer for attendees of GMDC HBW 2015 \u2014 a password to access the RNG site that will be good through Friday. \u201cIf you want to tour around the site [and] use it for the next couple of days, we can get it done for you at no cost or risk. We believe in it that strongly.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.drugstorenews.com/sites/drugstorenews.com/files/field_thumbnail_image/10-2015/BusinessSession2_3867.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Michael Johnsen", "description": "During Sundays Business Session at GMDC Health Beauty Wellness 2015, GMDC announced an investment the association has made on behalf of its members, subsidizing the cost of a crucial analytics tool provided through RetailNet Group.", "og": {"image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://www.drugstorenews.com/sites/drugstorenews.com/files/field_medium_image/10-2015/BusinessSession2_3867.jpg", "height": 200}, "type": "article", "title": "GMDC partners with RetailNet Group on analytics solution"}, "twitter": {"description": "During Sunday\u2019s Business Session at GMDC Health Beauty Wellness 2015, GMDC announced an investment the association has made on behalf of its members, subsidizing the cost of a crucial analytics tool provided through RetailNet Group.", "title": "GMDC partners with RetailNet Group on analytics solution", "url": "http://www.drugstorenews.com/article/gmdc-partners-retailnetgroup-unlock-data", "image": "http://www.drugstorenews.com/sites/drugstorenews.com/files/field_main_image/2015-10/BusinessSession2_3867.jpg", "site": "@drugstorenews", "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-10-04 01:01:00", "sailthru.title": "GMDC partners with RetailNet Group on analytics solution", "keywords": "gmdc, RetailNet Group, data, health, beauty, wellness", "google-site-verification": "qD-DLdnS9RBbjYJ-MITi4cSvUByohsoX4WClEJJuv7I", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.drugstorenews.com/sites/drugstorenews.com/files/field_main_image/2015-10/BusinessSession2_3867.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd007\"", "article_summary": "This data enables the opportunity to create a comprehensive deep-dive in support of customer meetings.\u201dThe new GMDC/RNG Insights Portal provides GMDC members three perspectives that will enhance conversations between suppliers and their retail partners.\nMembers can align with trends impacting retailers and their strategic initiatives, and forecast growth \u2014 sales, stores, comps.\n\u201cThis is just a really useful framework to help organize the thinking around: Where are the changes happening in retail?\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a first-time attendee here and you want to punch above your weight class, there\u2019s probably an opportunity within the Insights Portal.\nMembers can use this tool to understand the biggest trends happening and identify where to align assets \u2014 winning channels and retailers."}
