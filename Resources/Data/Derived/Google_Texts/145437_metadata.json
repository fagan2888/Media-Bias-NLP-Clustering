As Naomi Klein says, \u201cClimate change isn\u2019t just a disaster. It\u2019s also our best chance to demand and build a better world.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s what makes this march important. To paraphrase Bill McKibben, it\u2019s not so much about changing light bulbs as it is about changing the system that\u2019s powering our destruction.\n\nKlein, whose new book, \u201cThis Changes Everything,\u201d is the workbook for this new, more assertive, more powerful environmental movement (and the subtitle of which, \u201cCapitalism vs. The Climate,\u201d sums things up neatly), argues convincingly that \u201cour economic system and our planetary system are now at war \u2026 there are policies that can lower emissions quickly, and successful models all over the world for doing so. The biggest problem is that we have governments that don\u2019t believe in governing.\u201d\n\nIf government believes that energy assets cannot possibly be stranded and capital must be allowed to pursue its interests no matter how harmful, there\u2019s only one strategy for slowing the temperature rise that will eventually cripple the earth for 1,000 years. Unless you want to leave it to the very corporations that have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo and fighting change, which isn\u2019t much of a strategy. Remember that Exxon Mobil remains in the world\u2019s top three most profitable corporations. Why would it want anything to change?\n\nNo, the only choice is for people to fight climate change ourselves, by confronting the fossil fuel industry and fighting plutocracy. And while marches rarely change things immediately, they do demonstrate potential power. Sometimes, marches and associated activities \u2014 in recent times, most notably against the Vietnam War and for civil rights \u2014 have made a difference in moving history in the right direction.\n\nCapitalism needs to expand in order to survive, Exxon Mobil is not going to willingly give up its stranded assets, and government will not force it to. And yet corporate sacrifice is in order. Chris Hayes convincingly compares the essential losses that fossil fuel companies face if we are to reduce the impact of climate change \u2014 somewhere between $10 and $20 trillion, according to his estimates \u2014 with the costs to slaveholders at the end of the Civil War. This was within government\u2019s power, and can be again, but not this day.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat\u2019s why so many centrists, liberals and progressives are depressed into inaction; they see no way of winning this struggle, no matter how critical. This defeatism, in turn, leads to Obama-style compromises in which the importance of working to limit the catastrophic effects of climate change are acknowledged but action is mostly limited to adaptation to those effects, adaptation that cannot possibly succeed in the long run without complementary mitigation. The fact is we must burn fewer fossil fuels.\n\nWe\u2019ll continue to burn carbon short-term, but we don\u2019t need the added risk of projects like the Tar Sands and fracking. Rather, we need policies that scale renewable energy sources up quickly. Klein cites the example of Germany, which reached a goal of making about 25 percent of its energy clean and renewable within 15 years, not through nuclear energy or massive hydroelectric projects but with bold national policies that systematically encouraged small players like municipalities and co-ops. (The parallels to agriculture are obvious, appealing, and relevant, but you can draw those conclusions yourself here.) \u201cIf,\u201d says Klein, \u201cyou believe that because this is a big problem you need mega solutions \u2014 well, that\u2019s not true. The most successful approach is decentralized and small, not, \u2018me and my friends will start an energy co-op,\u2019 but well-designed government policies that support small, clean, local energy generators.\u201d\n\nNone of this will be easy, of course, but climate change provides us with an opportunity to remake our society in an image that comes closer to its rhetoric. \u201cIf we are to have any hope of making the kind of civilizational leap required of this fateful decade\u2026\u201d writes Klein, we need \u201ca robust social movement [that will] demand (and create) political leadership that is not only committed to making polluters pay for a climate-ready public sphere, but willing to revive two lost arts: long-term public planning, and saying no to powerful corporations.\u201d\n\nWe can change what seems inevitable; it will just take sacrifice and hard work, what Klein calls \u201cMarshall Plan levels of response.\u201d We are nowhere near that now, though we can point to thus-far successful opposition to destructive projects like the Keystone XL pipeline and the ongoing moratorium on fracking in New York State, or support for the success of the divestment movement. These are important, but compared to the scope of the threat they are not nearly enough.\n\nWe have to think bigger, and we have that opportunity. The same things that can fix climate can fix many other problems \u2014 agriculture, health care, inequality, campaign finance \u2014 because to be successful the climate movement must be a pro-democracy movement.
