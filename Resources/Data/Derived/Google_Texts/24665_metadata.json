But previously tribal police didn\u2019t have access to this database.\n\n\"Tribal governments are responsible for law enforcement and the maintenance of good order within their Indian country,\u201d the FBI writes in a notice to be published in Thursday\u2019s edition of the Federal Register. \"Some tribes have for years issued firearm permits authorizing persons in their territories to possess and to carry concealed firearms. If a tribe chooses to access (the criminal background check system) pursuant to this rule, it will improve that tribe\u2019s ability to prevent and reduce illegal gun possession in its jurisdiction.\u201d\n\nWhile the FBI is granting tribal law enforcement agencies access to the database, they will not be required to run background checks on American Indians who are looking to buy guns.\n\n\"This rule does not, in any way, preempt tribal law,\u201d the FBI wrote. \u201cAccess is wholly discretionary on the part of the tribes. This rule does not in any way mandate tribal government action.\u201d\n\nThe FBI estimates it takes about two to three minutes to conduct a background check.\n\nThe FBI originally proposed giving tribal law enforcement agencies access to the criminal background check system in January 2013.\n\nThe changes will go into effect in 60 days, after the final rule is published Thursday.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.title": "FBI expands background checks on tribal land", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:59-05:00", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "title": "FBI expands background checks on tribal land", "url": "http://thehill.com/regulation/224773-fbi-expands-background-checks-on-tribal-land", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:59:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "author": "Tim Devaney", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/regulation/224773-fbi-expands-background-checks-on-tribal-land", "dcterms.date": "2014-11-19T18:07-05:00", "dcterms.creator": "Ben Goad", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-19T18:07:07-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:59:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/regulation/224773-fbi-expands-background-checks-on-tribal-land", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "card": "summary", "title": "FBI expands background checks on tribal land"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcaff6\"", "article_summary": "The FBI originally proposed giving tribal law enforcement agencies access to the criminal background check system in January 2013.\nUnder new regulations, tribal law enforcement agencies will be allowed, though not required, to access the FBI\u2019s criminal background check system before issuing gun licenses on reservations.\nThis rule does not in any way mandate tribal government action.\u201dThe FBI estimates it takes about two to three minutes to conduct a background check.\n\"This rule does not, in any way, preempt tribal law,\u201d the FBI wrote.\nThe FBI\u2019s National Instant Criminal Background Check System, created by the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, gives law enforcement agencies information about criminals who are prohibited from owning guns."}
