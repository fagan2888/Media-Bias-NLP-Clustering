POLITICO Pro Obama faces port politics\n\nPresident Barack Obama may have to intervene directly in the West Coast ports dispute, becoming the first Democratic president since Jimmy Carter to impose a resolution on a private labor-management conflict.\n\nThe slowdown in shipping comes at an especially awkward time for Obama, who is trying to push through a global trade deal largely opposed by organized labor.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nOn Sunday, Obama sent Labor Secretary Tom Perez to San Francisco to press both sides toward agreement. A federal mediator previously sent to the West Coast had failed to resolve the matter.\n\nLabor and management both know that, should Perez also fail and the stalemate continue, the next logical step would be for the president to declare a national emergency under the 1947 Taft-Hartley Act and force a solution. The last president to take such action was George W. Bush in 2002. In that instance, as in this one, the conflict concerned the 29 West Coast ports.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a fairly significant risk here,\u201d a former Obama administration official said. \u201cOne, that the secretary\u2019s not going to be able to get a settlement. And two, if he doesn\u2019t get a settlement, what\u2019s the next step for the president?\u201d\n\nThe dispute is simple enough: shipowners and the longshoremen who load and off-load cargo have failed to reach a new contract over a variety of terms and conditions of employment, from wages to health and benefits to the shipowners\u2019 use of contractors for work typically performed by longshoremen.\n\nBut \u201cif in the midst of a very significant labor dispute the president intervenes with an injunction in order to keep trade flowing, there\u2019s a risk that that will become emblematic of an anti-labor stance,\u201d the former administration official said.\n\nThe Obama administration has been on a pro-labor streak lately. In December, its National Labor Relations Board took a number of notably pro-labor actions, including issuance of a rule preventing management from delaying union elections through litigation. In January, the president proposed a number of labor-friendly policies focused on \u201cmiddle-class economics,\u201d including mandatory paid sick leave and free community college. And in his State of the Union address he voiced support for \u201claws that strengthen rather than weaken unions, and give American workers a voice,\u201d a sentiment he repeated in a recent interview with Vox.\n\nBut the president\u2019s advocacy for the Trans-Pacific Partnership is an irritant to labor unions that were just getting over being placed largely on hold during Obama\u2019s first term, when he declined to spend political capital on the Employee Free Choice Act \u201ccard check\u201d bill and refused to grant unions exemptions to the Affordable Care Act\u2019s tax on \u201cCadillac\u201d health insurance plans.\n\nNow the accumulating economic damage from the ports crisis puts Obama in a bind.\n\n\u201cAnything that drives down growth, anything that slows down job creation, anything that hurts workers\u2019 wages, is going to be viewed as a negative by the administration,\u201d said Seth Harris, distinguished scholar at Cornell University\u2019s School of Industrial and Labor Relations who served as deputy secretary of labor in 2013. \u201cSo they can tolerate some amount of slowdown on the West Coast ports, but they can\u2019t tolerate an extended period of delay in solving this problem.\u201d\n\nThe problem is compounded by increased competition from other international ports \u2014 something none of Obama\u2019s predecessors had to worry about.\n\n\u201cWe have new competition from a widened Panama Canal coming online, from an improved port in Vancouver, from the Chinese wanting to build a port in Nicaragua,\u201d said Mickey Kantor, President Bill Clinton\u2019s former U.S. trade representative and secretary of commerce, who now consults for the Retail Industry Leaders Association. \u201cI mean, a lot is going on here, and it goes way beyond just the interest, frankly, of either side on the West Coast.\u201d\n\nEnding labor-management conflicts by executive fiat typically favors management\u2019s interest over labor\u2019s, something no Democratic president is ever eager to do. Carter felt compelled in 1978 to halt a coalminers\u2019 strike in the midst of the energy crisis. Ronald Reagan, by contrast, lost no sleep over invoking Taft-Hartley to end the 1981 air traffic controllers strike, firing the striking controllers in the process. (He could do that because they were federal, not private-sector, workers.)\n\nBefore Carter, the most recent Taft-Hartley presidential intervention in a private labor-management dispute had occurred in 1971 under Richard M. Nixon \u2014 like Bush and Reagan, a Republican. For Nixon, as for Bush (and now Obama), the standoff occurred at the West Coast ports.\n\nThe rancorous current disagreement between the shipowners, represented by the Pacific Maritime Association, and the dockworkers, represented by the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, has often blurred the lines between fact and public relations fiction. The PMA has accused the longshoremen of slowing down their work to provoke a crisis, while the workers claim the PMA is, in some instances, deliberately locking them out from their work. Both accusations are, as best as an outsider can determine, at least partly true. Both sides have recently agreed to stop discussing the negotiations with the press.\n\nBlame for the gridlock may be difficult to assign with any precision, but its effects are not. Dozens of ships lie anchored off the West Coast awaiting off-loading. California citrus growers can\u2019t export their goods quickly, and auto manufacturers are reducing output. On Tuesday, Honda said it would slow down its production at U.S. manufacturing facilities, citing reduced access to cheap parts imports.\n\nTensions came to a head over Presidents Day weekend when the PMA shut down the West Coast ports to incoming cargo to avoid paying holiday and overtime rates to dockworkers who they claimed were involved in a slowdown. That prompted Obama to send Perez. Retailers and manufacturers had been urging Obama to intervene for months, but this marked the administration\u2019s first significant involvement in the dispute.\n\nReportedly, the parties have been near a deal for at least a week or two. But they\u2019re stalled on deciding how to negotiate grievances after a new contract is signed, discord that is reportedly focused on a single arbitrator who is seen as unfairly pro-business. If that\u2019s still the case, a speedy agreement is possible, and the president can score a quick political victory.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got a lot of economic and political pressures that have built up and you\u2019ve got the president\u2019s attentions, \u201c said Harley Shaiken, a labor specialist at Berkeley. \u201cAll that speaks to the secretary of labor achieving the compromise sooner, perhaps much sooner, rather than later.\u201d\n\nBut if Perez should fail, Obama may have to enter the dispute himself, by either mounting the bully pulpit or exercising his executive authority \u2014 all at the same time he\u2019s trying to push through fast-track for TPP.\n\nWest Coast dockworkers are highly paid (about $30-$50 per hour for senior longshoremen), partly because of the ILWU\u2019s aggressive bargaining culture and partly because these workers inhabit an enviable choke point in an import-hungry U.S. economy. About 50 percent of all container cargo entering the United States is off-loaded at West Coast ports. That often prompts ire from business groups dependent on uninterrupted trade and politicians keen on accelerating economic growth.\n\n\u201cThis is a small union, 20,000 members, with very strong power given where they\u2019re located,\u201d Shaiken said. \u201cBut that power is so extensive the union can\u2019t fully use it without provoking federal intervention.\u201d\n\nThe ambiguities of the West Coast standoff somewhat complicate the situation. Obama has executive authority to intervene to halt a lockout by management or a strike by labor, but neither is occurring in any overt form. It seems likelier that the PMA would provoke executive intervention by imposing an unambiguous lockout, because intervention would likely favor PMA. Such a move might force Obama\u2019s hand. Far preferable, from his point of view, would be for Perez to clear any obstacles that lie in the path of a quick agreement.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "He may have to intervene directly in a labor dispute.", "title": "Obama faces port politics", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/02/president-obama-port-politics-115277.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/02/17/150217_west_coast_port_dispute_ap_1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "trade,Tom Perez,barack obama,ports,department of labor", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "He may have to intervene directly in a labor dispute.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9c5b\"", "article_summary": "POLITICO Pro Obama faces port politicsPresident Barack Obama may have to intervene directly in the West Coast ports dispute, becoming the first Democratic president since Jimmy Carter to impose a resolution on a private labor-management conflict.\nIn that instance, as in this one, the conflict concerned the 29 West Coast ports.\nFor Nixon, as for Bush (and now Obama), the standoff occurred at the West Coast ports.\nAbout 50 percent of all container cargo entering the United States is off-loaded at West Coast ports.\nLoaded container trucks line-up at a gate at the Port of Seattle on Tuesday after seaports on the West Coast that were all but shut over the weekend."}
