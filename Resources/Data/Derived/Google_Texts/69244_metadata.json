With his poll numbers in decline, Jeb is rolling out endorsements and assuring reporters that he\u2019s meeting fundraising targets and will have plenty of money to take the Jeb 2016 machine all the way through the primary season. The arc of Jeb\u2019s campaign is following a very Bush-like trajectory \u2013 he started the nominating contest with a \u201cshock and awe\u201d strategy of winning the primary early by scaring off all other pretenders; now he\u2019s fighting off an unexpectedly resilient insurgency and promising that everything will work out in the end because he\u2019s prepared to, ahem, stay the course.\n\nTo justify Jeb\u2019s continued presence in the race, his campaign is making the argument that Bush\u2019s path to victory is to wait for all the other candidates to fade or implode, which will clear the way for him to win the nomination through attrition:\n\nBut Bush\u2019s financial team and strategists argue that he should now be judged by a different benchmark. Their mantra: He\u2019s built to last. Using phrases like \u201cgo the distance,\u201d \u201dmarathon\u201d and \u201clong haul,\u201d they argue that the former Florida governor is uniquely positioned to outlast other candidates, regardless of the fundraising number he posts for the third quarter.\n\nIt\u2019s not the worst strategy ever devised \u2013 that\u2019s basically how Mitt Romney won the nomination in 2012. But Romney had the benefit of running in a field stuffed with dopes and jokers who had no business running for president. He could outlast people like Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum because they were unserious candidates who never really posed any threat to Romney\u2019s establishment support. Jeb doesn\u2019t have that luxury. Right now he\u2019s digging up oppo on two candidates who could conceivably siphon away his donors and establishment backers: Marco Rubio and John Kasich. And while Romney was viewed as \u201cgood enough\u201d by conservatives, those same voters have made it pretty clear they have little respect or patience for another Bush.\n\nThat helps explain why Jeb, in the latest poll out from Pew, pulls in an absurdly low 4 percent of the Republican vote. That\u2019s a worrisome enough sign for Jeb\u2019s campaign, but when you dig into the poll\u2019s internals, you start to see just how much trouble Jeb is in.\n\nLet\u2019s start with comparing Jeb\u2019s numbers to those of front-runner Donald Trump. The Donald is pulling down 25 percent of the Republican vote, powered in large part by the anti-immigrant sentiment that is dominating the Republican electorate. According to Pew, 66 percent of Republican voters say immigration is \u201cvery important\u201d when deciding whom they\u2019ll vote for in 2016, and 43 percent of Republican voters are more likely to support a candidate who promises to deport every undocumented immigrant in the country. Trump \u2013 who has made immigrant-bashing the hot, angry core of his campaign \u2013 is the runaway favorite among those voters. Jeb, who is a relative moderate on the issue and preaches tolerance for immigrants, barely registers among this group.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Team Bush argues they're built to go the distance in the primary, but that won't matter if Jeb has nothing to offer", "author": "Simon Maloy", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Team Bush argues they're built to go the distance in the primary, but that won't matter if Jeb has nothing to offer", "title": "Jeb is cooked: Why megadonors\u2019 millions (probably) aren\u2019t going to save Bush\u2019s disastrous campaign", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/10/05/jeb_is_cooked_why_megadonors_millions_probably_arent_going_to_save_bushs_disastrous_campaign/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/09/jeb_bush14.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Team Bush argues they're built to go the distance in the primary, but that won't matter if Jeb has nothing to offer", "creator": "@SimonMaloy", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/09/jeb_bush14.jpg", "title": "Jeb is cooked: Why megadonors\u2019 millions (probably) aren\u2019t going to save Bush\u2019s disastrous campaign", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Jeb is cooked: Why megadonors\u2019 millions (probably) aren\u2019t going to save Bush\u2019s disastrous campaign", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2016 GOP primary, 2016 Republican primary, Conservatives, Donald Trump, Jeb Bush, John Kasich, Marco Rubio, republican voters, Republicans", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: 2016 GOP primary, 2016 Republican primary, Conservatives, Donald Trump, Jeb Bush, John Kasich, Marco Rubio, republican voters, Republicans, Elections News, Politics NewsThe Jeb Bush \u201cDon\u2019t Panic, Everything Is Fine\u201d campaign is up and running.\nThe Donald is pulling down 25 percent of the Republican vote, powered in large part by the anti-immigrant sentiment that is dominating the Republican electorate.\nThat helps explain why Jeb, in the latest poll out from Pew, pulls in an absurdly low 4 percent of the Republican vote.\nThat\u2019s a worrisome enough sign for Jeb\u2019s campaign, but when you dig into the poll\u2019s internals, you start to see just how much trouble Jeb is in.\nTrump \u2013 who has made immigrant-bashing the hot, angry core of his campaign \u2013 is the runaway favorite among those voters."}
