Cain has previously attended Berkeley council meetings on behalf of the No Berkeley Beverage Tax campaign.\n\nTax opponents had also argued that ballot language that says the tax would be paid by distributors, not by consumers, is misleading because they believe distributors would pass on the extra cost to consumers.\n\nBut Grillo ruled against tax opponents on that issue, saying they failed to provide clear and convincing evidence based on the ballot statement that the tax won\u2019t be paid by consumers is misleading or partial.\n\nThe judge said tax opponents \u201conly speculate that it is like that such cost will be passed down to consumers, but it is unknown at this point whether or not any of the tax will eventually be passed down to consumers.\u201d\n\nGrillo said the city correctly pointed out that distributors and retailers could choose to absorb the cost of the tax in order to better compete with other businesses.\n\nBerkeley school board member Joshua Daniels, who is co-chair of the campaign in favor of Measure D, said Grillo\u2019s order that the ballot language be changed is only a \u201crelatively minor\u201d development and \u201cdoesn\u2019t concern us at all\u201d because \u201ceveryone knows that the measure is focused on preventing diabetes,\u201d and he thinks it will still be approved.\n\nDaniels said that overall Grillo\u2019s ruling is \u201ca victory\u201d for Measure D supporters.\n\nGrillo\u2019s ruling came one day before the deadline on Wednesday for the Alameda County Registrar of Voters Office to send ballot arguments to the printer so that voters can receive them well in advance of the election on Nov. 4.\n\nOriginal Post July 2, 2014\n\nBy Charles Siler, Berkeleyside\n\nBerkeley City Council voted unanimously Tuesday night to include a proposal that would tax distributors of sugar-sweetened beverages on the November ballot.\n\nVoters will decide on penny-per-ounce tax on soda and other sugar-sweetened beverages.\n\nThe measure, which proposes a one-cent-per-ounce charge at the distributor level, would be the first such tax passed in the country. Richmond tried to pass a similar tax in 2012, but it was voted down after a $2.7 million campaign by the soda industry.\n\nSupporters of the tax point to studies linking sugary drinks to childhood obesity and diabetes. Members of community organization Berkeley vs. Big Soda gathered on the steps of city hall before the Tuesday night meeting to voice their support of the tax.\n\n\u201cWe want to support our kids. We don\u2019t want our kids to be sick with diabetes,\u201d said Dr. Vicki Alexander, co-chair of the Berkeley Healthy Child Foundation, at the council meeting. \u201cWe know that we can change that trend.\u201d\n\nOpponents of the tax said the measure would prove ineffective.\n\n\u201cI agree that diabetes and childhood obesity are big issues. I just don\u2019t necessarily agree that taxation on sweetened beverages or soda is the best way to deal with that,\u201d said Jennifer Skidmore of J&J Vending. \u201cStatistics show that purchasing of sweetened beverages is already on the decline, without taxation.\u201d\n\nSupporters also say the tax is a social justice issue, pointing to the higher rates of obesity in black and Latino communities.\n\n\u201cResearch shows diabetes rates in Latino, African-American communities have reached epidemic proportions,\u201d said Xavier Morales, executive director of the Latino Coalition for a Healthy California. \u201cThat\u2019s not an exaggeration.\u201d\n\n\u201cBig Soda will claim that we are attacking a product that is beloved by low-income folks,\u201d said Councilmember Laurie Capitelli, \u201cbut those are the people who are coming to us and asking us to put this on the ballot.\u201d\n\nTed Mundorff, CEO and president of Landmark Theaters, which owns both the Shattuck Cinemas and the California Theater, said revenue from the tax would not be earmarked for any healthy initiatives.\n\n\u201cIf we could solve obesity and diabetes with a one-cent tax I\u2019d say bring it on, let\u2019s do two cents,\u201d Mundorff said. \u201cBut the reality is that this cent is going into the general fund, and it is not earmarked to do anything, except to hurt business.\u201d\n\nBecause the measure proposes a general tax, as opposed to a special tax, revenue from the tax would go into the general fund and cannot be reserved for any special purpose. With a special tax, the money could be designated for anti-obesity initiatives, such as nutrition programs in schools \u2014 but a special tax requires a two-thirds majority vote, while a general tax requires only 50 percent plus one.\n\nThe sugar tax on San Francisco\u2019s November ballot is a special tax, and so will require a two-thirds majority to pass, unlike the Berkeley proposal. The San Francisco measure also proposes a tax of two cents per ounce, rather than Berkeley\u2019s one.\n\nBerkeley\u2019s November ballot will read: \u201cShall an ordinance imposing a 1\u00a2 per ounce general tax on the distribution of high-calorie, sugary drinks (e.g., sodas, energy drinks, presweetened teas) and sweeteners used to sweeten such drinks, but exempting: (1) sweeteners (e.g., sugar, honey,syrups) typically used by consumers and distributed to grocery stores; (2) drinks and sweeteners distributed to very small retailers; (3) diet drinks, milk products, 100% juice, baby formula, alcohol, or drinks taken for medical reasons, be adopted?\u201d Councilmember Linda Maio proposed the new, slightly different language at the Tuesday meeting.\n\nSupporters of the tax acknowledged that in the coming months, the soda industry will likely campaign heavily against the tax measure in Berkeley and in San Francisco.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think even if they spent a million dollars they could confuse the people of Berkeley. So I\u2019m not really worried about how much money they spend,\u201d said Councilmember Kriss Worthington. \u201cThe people of Berkeley are too smart to be confused.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to be a lot of opposition, there\u2019s going to be lot of lies,\u201d said Mayor Tom Bates. \u201cThey\u2019re going to be sending people door to door with distortions, with misinformation, and it\u2019s going to be tough. So we all need to work. This is the beginning, this is not the end.\u201d\n\nKQED News Associate Berkeleyside is an independently owned news website based in Berkeley, Calif.
