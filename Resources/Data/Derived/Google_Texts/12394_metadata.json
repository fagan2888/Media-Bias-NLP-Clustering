(Photo: Courtesy of Skylands Photography) Story Highlights The French Alliance Ball on May 16 benefited the historic Jacobus Vanderveer House in Bedminster, which played a pivotal role in the American Revolutionary War.\n\nHonored guests arrived at the elegant event by horse and carriage met by actors dressed as Gen. Henry Knox and Gen. George Washington, who greeted and danced with guests.\n\nHonored guests included Col. Jack Jacobs, Medal of Honor recipient, and Consul General Deputy of France in New York Bernard Faro.\n\nThe ball's ultimate purpose was to kick off the organization's capital campaign to expand and add gardens to the historic home.\n\nThe crystal glistened, the candles flickered, the canons roared, and even Mother Nature conspired to add drama to the French Alliance Ball on May 16 to benefit the historic Jacobus Vanderveer House in Bedminster, which played a pivotal role in the American Revolutionary War.\n\nHonored guests arrived at the elegant event by horse and carriage met by actors dressed as Gen. Henry Knox and Gen. George Washington who greeted and danced with guests \u2014 twirling around the dance floor in the stately mansion at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster.\n\nHosted by the Friends of the Jacobus Vanderveer House (JVH), honored guests included Col. Jack Jacobs, Medal of Honor recipient, military analyst for NBC/MSNBC News and a resident of Far Hills who attended with his wife, Susan, and Consul General Deputy of France in New York Bernard Faro and Mrs. Faro.\n\nWith the ultimate purpose of kicking off the organization's capital campaign to expand and add gardens to the historic home, the Friends of the JVH also wanted their guests to have a chance to step back in time.\n\n\"We wanted guests to experience a taste of the Grand Alliance Ball held in 1779, hosted by George and Martha Washington, to celebrate the newly established alliance with France and the birth of our freedom,\" said Robin Ray, president of the Friends of the JVH Board of Trustees.\n\nWhile the British may not have been on the horizon at the French Alliance Ball, Mother Nature added an element of drama when the horizon turned dark bluish purple at approximately 7:45 p.m. just as the carriage was arriving with honored guests and the canon display was about to begin. The Club's warning sirens blared to warn of an impending storm \u2014 which guests soon found out was a tornado warning.\n\nFortunately, the storm passed and the portended tornado never formed, and guests were able to enjoy safe passage into the world of yesterday.\n\nValue of history\n\nFor Jacobs, the value of history cannot be ignored.\n\nQuoting the philosopher George Santayana, Jacobs, said, \"Those who ignore history are doomed to repeat it.\"\n\nJacobs also said the preservation of historic sites is important because they also embody the essence of who we are, and once they are gone, they are gone forever.\n\nJane Alcoff, a resident of Whippany and a member of the Washington Association, said she was thrilled with the opportunity to attend the French Alliance Ball, not only because she loves dancing, but at a very early age developed a love of history \u2014 particularly the Revolutionary War era.\n\nLeslie Reith, a resident of Berkeley Heights who is an accomplished ballerina and competitive ballroom dancer, dances at the French Alliance Ball.

Henry Knox and Gen. George Washington; Elan Artists, a Julliard trained quartet; Four-In-Hand Carriage; The Scott Ragsdale Orchestra; and Garden State Fireworks.\n\nAn opening waltz was performed by Sergei Bedroznov, a Russian champion dancer, national competitive judge and proprietor of Ballroom Dance of New Jersey, and Leslie Reith, a resident of Berkeley Heights who is an accomplished ballerina and competitive ballroom dancer.\n\nA future vision of the past\n\nRay said the capital campaign will support the next step in realizing the Friends' mission to establish a small but important museum complex with outbuildings and walkways that complement the restored house.\n\nThe Guest of Honor at the French Alliance Ball was Col. Jack Jacobs, Medal of Honor recipient, military analyst for NBC/MSNBC News and a resident of Far Hills, who attended with his wife, Susan.

Kellogg Foundation \u2014 to implement Phase II of the Friends' long-range strategic plan that would include the building of a kitchen garden, historic walkways, an orchard and several 18th-century-style outbuildings.\n\nRay said, \"The plan will include a large Dutch Colonial barn and barnyard that will provide much-needed space for our rapidly growing education and leadership programs.\"\n\nFor more information about the Jacobus Vanderveer House, visit: www.jvanderveerhouse.org.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://mycj.co/1S8gukD", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "The crystal glistened, the candles flickered, the canons roared, and even Mother Nature conspired to add drama to the French Alliance Ball held May 16 to benefit the historic Jacobus Vanderveer House in Bedminster which played a pivotal role in the American Revolutionary War.", "og": {"site_name": "MY CENTRAL JERSEY", "description": "The crystal glistened, the candles flickered, the canons roared, and even Mother Nature conspired to add drama to the French Alliance Ball held May 16 to benefit the historic Jacobus Vanderveer House in Bedminster which played a pivotal role in the American Revolutionary War.", "title": "Stepping back in time at French Alliance Ball", "url": "http://www.mycentraljersey.com/story/news/local/somerset-county/2015/05/19/french-alliance-ball/27593101/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/mycentraljersey.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The crystal glistened, the candles flickered, the canons roared, and even Mother Nature conspired to add drama to the French Alliance Ball held May 16 to benefit the historic Jacobus Vanderveer House in Bedminster which played a pivotal role in the American Revolutionary War.", "title": "Stepping back in time at French Alliance Ball", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d4e3bab70c397294872c2a5f5df4cdd626961f4a/c=0-30-511-541&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/05/19/Bridgewater/B9317408863Z.1_20150519144725_000_G65AR81CB.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@MyCentralJersey", "site": "@MyCentralJersey", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=859380356", "fb": {"app_id": 177893718898560}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "French Alliance Ball, Jacobus Vanderveer House, American Revolutionary War"}, "article_summary": "Leslie Reith, a resident of Berkeley Heights who is an accomplished ballerina and competitive ballroom dancer, dances at the French Alliance Ball.\n(Photo: Courtesy of Skylands Photography) Story Highlights The French Alliance Ball on May 16 benefited the historic Jacobus Vanderveer House in Bedminster, which played a pivotal role in the American Revolutionary War.\nThe Guest of Honor at the French Alliance Ball was Col.
