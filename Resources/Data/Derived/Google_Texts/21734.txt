Officials say a man was killed in an early morning crash Sunday in east Louisville after the car he was driving slammed into a tree.

The man, who has not yet been identified publicly, was driving his white Chevrolet Silverado pickup eastbound on Old Heady Road around 4:20 a.m. when he swerved into the westbound lane, nearly striking the vehicle of an off-duty Louisville Metro Police officer, said LMPD spokesman Dwight Mitchell.

Mitchell said the man, a white male in his 40s, continued driving eastbound before striking a tree in the 5800 block of Old Heady Road near the cross street of Hopewell Road and close to Fisherman's Park. He was pronounced dead at the scene, Mitchell said.

LMPD's traffic unit is investigating the crash, Mitchell said. He said alcohol and drugs have not been ruled out and said speed may also have been a factor in the crash.

Mitchell said the department's Public Integrity Unit is also looking into the situation because the off-duty officer was "trying to affect a traffic stop" at the time of the crash.
