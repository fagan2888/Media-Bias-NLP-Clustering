Title I of the ADA specifically prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities, and that prohibition extends to medical conditions.\n\nConfusion reigns\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, however, encourages employee wellness programs, and the EEOC\u2019s view of these programs has confused and frustrated the managers who design and implement them.\n\nEarly 2015 could be eventful for EEOC oversight of employee wellness programs if, as some expect, the commission finally clarifies how Title I applies. Employers are concerned that guidance so far has been both vague and inconsistent with HIPAA and ACA regulations.\n\nWellness programs have been shown in some studies to reduce medical costs for health insurance plans and employers. Although there have been some questions raised about its findings, an often-cited study published in the January 2010 issue of Health Affairs found that medical costs fell more than $3.27 for every dollar spent on wellness programs and that absenteeism costs fell by about as much. The first author of that study, Katherine Baicker, PhD, has noted, though, that the findings come with many qualifiers.\n\nThe hang-up with the EEOC is the word voluntary. The ADA forbids employers from requiring employees or their dependents to submit to medical testing or screening unless they are job-related and consistent with business necessity. In October 2014, the EEOC filed a preliminary injunction aimed at preventing Honeywell from moving forward with biometric testing, a medical exam that assesses a person\u2019s risk for diabetes, heart disease, and other conditions. In its complaint against Honeywell, the EEOC asserted that the wellness program wasn\u2019t voluntary because it would penalize employees if they or their spouses do not get biometric screening because, according to the EEOC, they\u2019d stand to lose up to $4,000 in the form of surcharges and lost health savings account contributions. The federal court\u2019s denial of the injunction effectively ended the litigation, but the commission says it is continuing to investigate the Honeywell wellness program.\n\nThe Honeywell action was the latest in a spate of suits the Chicago EEOC office brought late last year against Midwestern employers over wellness programs, the first such actions the commission had taken under the ADA. The first lawsuit involves an employee of a Wisconsin energy company who refused to participate in the health screening. The company allegedly told the employee she would have to pay the full cost of her health insurance as a result, then fired her shortly thereafter. The second targets a Wisconsin plastics company that, the complaint says, canceled an employee\u2019s health insurance after he missed a scheduled health screening because he was out on medical leave.\n\nAre incentives mandatory?\n\nThese two cases appear to be more clear cut because employers are alleged to have fired or denied health insurance coverage to employees who refused or were unable to participate in wellness programs, according to employment lawyer Leslie Silverman, a former EEOC commissioner appointed by George W. Bush. The Honeywell case is more troubling for employers, she says, because it pivots on the definition of voluntary and the use of incentives as they apply to wellness programs.\n\nThe question as to what constitutes voluntary medical tests and screenings for workplace wellness programs goes back to the early 2000s, says Silverman, when the EEOC declared that employers were permitted to make disability-related inquiries or conduct medical examinations that are part of a voluntary wellness program without having to meet the job-related or business-necessity standard.\n\nReading from a Q&A in the EEOC\u2019s 2000 enforcement guidance on disability-related inquiries and medical examinations of employees under the ADA, Silverman highlights the last line: \u201cA wellness program is voluntary as long as an employer neither requires participation nor penalizes employees who do not participate.\u201d\n\nACA changes the game\n\nSince 2000, HIPAA regulations have been revised to limit employee incentives for participation in a wellness program. The adoption of the ACA raised that incentive level to 30%. Silverman says during this period the EEOC has never said what kind of an incentive or penalty would render it involuntary \u2014 and the commissioners have been asked.\n\nNancy Hammer, a lawyer at the Society of Human Resources Management, an international organization for human resources executives and administrators, was at a May 2013 meeting with business leaders at which the commission was asked.\n\n\u201cEven then, there were representatives expressing the employer viewpoint that we really need you to promulgate some kind of guidance for employers so they know where the bright lines are because that\u2019s the most important thing for structuring plans and for employers to know that they are complying with the law,\u201d she recalls.\n\n\u201cWe need to figure this out,\u201d says Nancy Hammer of the Society of Human Resources Management. Employers want to know whether they are complying with the law.\n\nFor members of her organization, Hammer says getting clarity on the EEOC\u2019s approach to wellness plans is important.\n\nWhen the members were surveyed on what changes they plan to make in 2015 in light of the ACA, one in four said they plan to implement or increase wellness offerings. Hammer says, \u201cWe need to figure this out.\u201d\n\nSpeaking with people at employer and business associations in Washington, you get the sense that the EEOC is an outlier among federal agencies regulating those benefits.\n\n\u201cThe administration has generally been supportive of these kinds of programs, and this is the only provision implemented under the Affordable Care Act that has bipartisan support,\u201d says Kathryn Wilber, senior health policy counsel to the American Benefits Council.\n\nEven the Obama administration seems to be trying to distance itself from the EEOC\u2019s attitude toward wellness programs.
