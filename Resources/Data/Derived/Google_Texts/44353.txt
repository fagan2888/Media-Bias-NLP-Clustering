Netflix has released the first teaser for their Bill Murray Christmas special “A Very Murray Christmas,” directed by “Lost in Translation’s” Sofia Coppola. The special has been described as “an homage to the classic variety show” and features Murray, as himself, worrying that “no one will show up to his TV show due to a terrible snow storm in New York City.
