President Obama announced his own plan today to revise those regulations. It could mean higher pay for millions of workers, but some businesses are worried about the costs.\n\nRELATED LINKS\n\nHari Sreenivasan has the story.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nPRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Thank you. Thank you.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: For the president, it\u2019s a new attempt to address pay equity without going through Congress, where his economic agenda is largely stalled. He\u2019s directing the Labor Department to update overtime pay rules for an estimated five million workers.\n\nPRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Today, I\u2019m going to use my pen to give more Americans the chance to earn the overtime pay that they deserve. Now, overtime\u2019s a pretty simple idea. If you have to work more, you should get paid more.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: The focus is on salaried workers, including shift leaders and managers at fast food restaurants and stores who are designated as supervisory and make at least $455 a week. The president wants to raise that salary threshold and change the definition of supervisor.\n\nPRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: It doesn\u2019t make sense that, in some cases, this rule actually makes it possible for salaried workers to be paid less than the minimum wage. It\u2019s not right when business owners who treat their employees fairly can be undercut by competitors who aren\u2019t treating their employees right. If you\u2019re working hard, you\u2019re barely making ends meet, you should be paid overtime, period.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has rejected the plan. It issued a statement that said, in part: \u201cChanging the rules for overtime eligibility will, just like increasing the minimum wage, make employees more expensive and will force employers to look for ways to cover these increased costs.\u201d\n\nRepublicans also protested, the Obama plan will cost jobs.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner:\n\nREP. JOHN BOEHNER, R-Ohio, Speaker of the House: If you don\u2019t have a job, you don\u2019t qualify for overtime. So what do you get out of it? You get nothing. The president\u2019s policies are making it difficult for employers to expand employment. And until the president\u2019s policies get out of the way, employers are going to continue to sit on their hands.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: The president is leaving it to the Labor Department to work out the details, and any proposed rule will be subject to public comment. That means a new overtime standard might take effect some time in 2015.\n\nWe get views from two camps deeply immersed in the debate.\n\nJared Bernstein is a former chief economist to Vice President Biden. He\u2019s written on this and is a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. And Dan Bosch is the manager of regulatory policy at the National Federation of Independent Business, a trade group opposed to the move.\n\nSo, Dan, let me start with you.\n\nWhy is reforming overtime going cost to jobs? How does it hurt small businesses?\n\nDAN BOSCH, National Federation of Independent Business: Well, for small businesses, this is just the latest in a long line of government mandates that have been coming out of Washington lately. This is on top of a proposed minimum wage increase, rising health care cost, and a tidal wave of government regulation. These burdens are disproportionately troubling to small businesses.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: What about this idea that this is just part of a larger onslaught that small businesses are feeling?\n\nJARED BERNSTEIN, Center on Budget and Policy Priorities: I don\u2019t think so.\n\nAnd, in fact, in this case, it\u2019s uniquely different from some of the other policies that Dan mentioned. For example, if an employer doesn\u2019t want to pay overtime to someone, that is time-and-a-half to a worker, they can hire a worker at a straight time wage, and that does two things. It actually saves the employer overtime costs and it creates more jobs, which is something that we could use about now.\n\nAnd that was actually one of the motivations for the overtime rules originally in the Fair Labor Standards Act that is now about 75 years old.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: Is that a possibility, that actually straight time workers or non-overtime employee could actually put a dent into this unemployment range or problem that everyone is trying to tackle?\n\nDAN BOSCH: Well, I think the smallest businesses, which is who I represent, usually around five to 10 employees per business, they\u2019re not going to have the capital to be able to bring on a new employee.\n\nWhat is going to happen is, the business owner will take on the added responsibility of the worker who should potentially be getting overtime now. And they will cap the overtime worker at 40 hours.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: So, is there a way that this could backfire?\n\nJARED BERNSTEIN: Well, I don\u2019t really understand the logic that Dan is espousing there, because the capital is actually \u2014 the capital, the labor cost has actually diminished.\n\nRemember, you would have to pay time-and-a-half for your overtime worker newly covered by this idea. And, remember, let\u2019s not lose the fact that we\u2019re talking about adjusting a threshold for inflation that hasn\u2019t been adjusted for 10 years. That threshold, below which you automatically get overtime right now, is about equal to the poverty level for a family of four.\n\nSo I think President Obama has a case when he talks about making this more fair for people who are working long hours. And, again, employers can avoid higher labor cost. That\u2019s not the same as with the minimum wage.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: And what about this idea that the threshold hasn\u2019t been adjusted for inflation even in the last nine years, that it\u2019s been flat?\n\nDAN BOSCH: Well, small businesses today, they\u2019re not rolling around in cash.\n\nOur small business optimism index that we release monthly shows small businesses see the economy at a recessionary level or a subpar growth level, so they are not in a position right now to be increasing their labor costs.\n\nJARED BERNSTEIN: Let me say something about that. The reason you work someone for overtime, the reason you have somebody work overtime is because the demand for the goods and services that you are providing is very strong.\n\nAnd you can\u2019t meet that based on simply straight time pay. If the story that Dan is telling is true \u2014 and I certainly believe him \u2014 then you\u2019re not seeing the kinds of pressures in terms of demand for what it is these small business folks are providing that they would need to use overtime.\n\nAnd if they don\u2019t need to use overtime, this doesn\u2019t affect them. If they do need to use overtime workers and they don\u2019t want to, they can hire someone at straight time and save themselves some salary there.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: Is that true, that if you\u2019re having to\u2026\n\nDAN BOSCH: I think the only point I would make there is, I don\u2019t know that the smallest businesses are going to bring on additional people.\n\nI think the small business owner will try to take over that additional work that needs to be done his or her self.\n\nJARED BERNSTEIN: So, here\u2019s the thing. Any time you get into this kind of discussion about what a mandate would do, you have to look back at the empirical evidence.\n\nAnd what it showed time and again, whether you\u2019re talking about minimum wages or even overtime rules, because we have raised this threshold in the past, businesses small and large, they hire when they need to, and they don\u2019t hire when they don\u2019t need to. And when we have increased this overtime threshold in the past, we haven\u2019t seen anything like the kinds of disemployment or job loss effects that Dan is suggesting we would.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: Dan, what about this idea that there are supervisors in name only, that perhaps some small employers are cheating the system by saying, hey, you know what, you are a supervisor, you are not eligible for overtime, even though they might not be making that much money?\n\nDAN BOSCH: I can\u2019t speak to whether or not companies are actually doing that. I\u2019m sure it happens somewhere. I don\u2019t know how prevalent it is.\n\nBut I would say that something that we have seen as a possible element that might come out of this proposal is that small businesses would have to calculate a percentage of what task you perform as an employee or supervisor and what you aren\u2019t. That, if that comes to fruition, is going to be extremely burdensome on small businesses. That is a very complicated calculation to have to make for every employee every week, every year.\n\nJARED BERNSTEIN: Well, in fact, that has always been part of the law. Part of the \u2014 this part of \u2014 this white-collar part of the Fair Labor Standards Act has always asked employers, how much of your time does your employee spend in a supervisory position?\n\nAnd that\u2019s \u2014 so there is nothing new about that. What is different here is that the way the law was changed in 2004, to the detriment \u2014 to the detriment of overtime workers, is that if you \u2014 if 95 percent of your time is spent doing the type of work that would be covered by overtime pay, and then for an hour a week, you supervise someone else, you can be exempted from overtime pay just based on that one little chunk of your week.\n\nAnd that\u2019s wrong. What you could end up with \u2014 in the current situation, what we have that is too many of these workers don\u2019t look like executives, managers, professional supervisors at all, but are treated that way under this law, and, therefore, don\u2019t get the overtime pay they should.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: Now, one of your concerns is, going forward, that this creates a climate of uncertainty for small businesses. Explain.\n\nDAN BOSCH: Well, this process is not going to just, you know, happen this week or even, you know, in a couple of weeks or months, what have you.\n\nThis is going to be an extremely lengthy process. And I actually think, personally, that I think you said in your piece that 2015 might be the time frame for this. I think that is extremely advanced. I don\u2019t know that this can happen that quickly, if the Department of Labor goes through the proper processes that it\u2019s supposed to.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: Can the administration get this done by the time they\u2019re out of office?\n\nJARED BERNSTEIN: Yes. I mean, this could be done in a matter of months.\n\nThere is a comment period where the administration, I think very justifiably, asks stakeholders to weigh in, what they think. And then \u2014 then the administration will step in and change the rules, much as we have been discussing so far.\n\nSo I can see this happening in a matter of months. In fact, if you go back to the 2004 changes, I think they took about six months, as I recall.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: All right.\n\nJared Bernstein from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, Dan Bosch from the Business \u2014 Federation of Independent Business, thanks so much for joining me.\n\nDAN BOSCH: Thank you.\n\nJARED BERNSTEIN: Thank you.", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama has ordered an update to overtime pay rules for an estimated 5 million workers.
