(whitehouse.gov)\n\nThe most well-known version of the 1863 speech is known as the \"Bliss Copy,\" displayed on the wall of the Lincoln Memorial, which refers to \"this nation, under God.\"\n\nInstead, Obama read from the \"Nicolay copy\" of the speech, that omits a mention of the Almighty.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Jay Carney said Tuesday that the President read the copy of the speech provided by the filmmaker.\n\nThrongs of guests attended a ceremony commemorating the 150th anniversary of address at the Soldiers' National Cemetery in Gettysburg, Penn. (Matt Rourke/AP)\n\n\"I think Ken Burns is a noted Civil War scholar,\" Carney said.\n\nllarson@nydailynews.com\n\nOn a mobile device?
