Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, retired Navy and NASA Space Shuttle pilot Mark Kelly, spoke at USC on March 8. Photo courtesy of USC Casden Institute\n\nInvoking a commitment to public service as an example of tikkun olam, or \u201crepairing the world,\u201d former astronaut and U.S. Navy Capt. Mark Kelly told a large, captivated audience at USC about the journey he and his wife, retired U.S. Rep. Gabrielle \u201cGabby\u201d Giffords (D-Ariz.), have been on since a 2011 assassination attempt on Giffords thrust them into the center of the gun-control movement.\n\nAnd Giffords, who has limited speaking ability, used the few words she offered to encourage the crowd: \u201cI\u2019m still fighting to make the world a better place, and you can, too. Get involved with your community. Be a leader, set an example. Be passionate, be courageous, be your best.\u201d\n\nPrior to representing Arizona\u2019s 8th Congressional District, Giffords, who is Jewish through her father\u2019s Lithuanian heritage, helmed her family\u2019s automotive business and served in the state legislature. A moderate Democrat, Giffords pushed Congress to provide further protection for her state\u2019s southern border and was a vocal supporter of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAlthough Giffords spoke briefly on March 8 at the 14th annual Carmen and Louis Warschaw Distinguished Lecture Series, organized by The Casden Institute for the Study of the Jewish Role in American Life at USC, she left most of the talking to her husband, Kelly, who is Catholic. A naval pilot during Operation Desert Storm who later joined NASA as a Space Shuttle pilot, he participated in and commanded numerous missions on Space Shuttles Endeavour and Discovery.\n\n\u201cWhen Gabby entered Congress in 2007, I thought I had the risky job,\u201d Kelly said during his remarks. \u201cI had flown 39 combat missions. I had flown two flights into space already by that point in my career. But as it turned out, Gabby was the one who would nearly lose her life serving her country. And what happened that day would certainly become the biggest challenge \u2014 for both of us, I think, personal challenge \u2014 that we would ever face.\u201d\n\nDuring a public event at an Arizona supermarket in January 2011, Jared Loughner approached Giffords and shot her in the left side of her forehead with a 9 mm pistol, before opening fire on the attending crowd \u2014 ultimately killing six people and injuring 12 others. Giffords was left partially paralyzed, and with limited speaking ability.\n\nIn a speech full of stories and personal parables on faith, fate and patience, Kelly recalled the two shocking phone calls he had with one of his wife\u2019s aides in the moments after the shooting. Kelly and his daughters immediately flew to Arizona from Texas, where he had been training for a mission.\n\nJust three months after being shot in the head, Giffords traveled to Florida to watch Kelly take off on a mission to the International Space Station. Although Kelly had initially backed out of the mission after the shooting, his family encouraged him to go. It was his last trip to space, and the last for the Space Shuttle Endeavor.\n\n\u201cMy wife, Gabby, could not be there for the landing. She was there for the liftoff, but while I was in space she had to have her final brain surgery, and that was to replace the piece of skull \u2014 which is about the size of my hand \u2014 with a prosthetic,\u201d Kelly said.\n\n\u201cAnd if any of you guys were to come to our house in Tucson, one of the first things Gabby may do if you haven\u2019t been there before is take you over to the freezer and pull out the blue Tupperware where she keeps the real skull. It\u2019s pretty incredible,\u201d he added. \u201cBut it shows you Gabby\u2019s attitude about this, and the fact when bad things happen to good people, you can get past them. And it was Gabby\u2019s strength that she drew from her Jewish values that allowed her to do this.\u201d\n\nIn August 2011, Giffords returned to Congress for the first time to vote to raise the federal debt ceiling. Still feeble, she received a standing ovation from her colleagues. Giffords officially resigned from Congress in January 2012 to focus on her recovery.\n\nJust over a year later, as the country reeled from the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut, Giffords and Kelly founded Americans for Responsible Solutions, a nonprofit and super PAC. It advocates for gun reforms, such as requiring background checks at gun shows and making it easier for law enforcement to go after gun traffickers. However, both Giffords and Kelly remain strong supporters of the Second Amendment, and they are both gun owners, Kelly said.\n\nIn April 2013, their organization helped bring a bipartisan bill to expand background checks to a vote in the Senate. It failed by six votes. A few days prior to speaking at USC, Giffords and Kelly returned to Congress to introduce a similar measure in the House, where they hope it will have a better chance of passing.\n\nPart of the problem, Kelly admitted in an interview with the Journal prior to his speech, is that members of both parties worry they may be targeted by gun rights advocates in their next election if they were to support such a measure. One of Americans for Responsible Solutions\u2019 goals, Kelly said, \u201cis to convince members of Congress that they can vote for this stuff and not lose their next election. The power of the gun lobby, while it\u2019s significant, it\u2019s not insurmountable.\u201d\n\nThis work, Kelly said, gives purpose to the horrific events his family has experienced.\n\n\u201cBefore all of this happened to us, while Gabby and I are people of faith, especially Gabby with her Jewish faith, I wasn\u2019t a big believer in fate. I just thought the world spins, and the clock ticks, and things did not happen for any particular reason,\u201d Kelly said. Now, he added, he feels something like providence in events.\n\nOf course, gun reform is just one of the things that Giffords is working on at the moment. She\u2019s focused on trying to repair herself as well.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m working on lots of therapy \u2014 speech therapy, physical therapy and yoga, too,\u201d she told the crowd. \u201cBut my spirit is as strong as ever.\u201d\n\nCOMMENTS\n\nView our privacy policy and terms of service.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.jewishjournal.com/lifestyle/article/giffords_finds_strength_direction_in_judaism", "site_name": "Jewish Journal", "image": "http://www.jewishjournal.com/images/featured/com-giffords-kelly_031315.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Giffords finds strength, direction in Judaism | Lifestyle"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 23102350, "title": "Giffords finds strength, direction in Judaism | Lifestyle", "url": "http://www.jewishjournal.com/lifestyle/article/giffords_finds_strength_direction_in_judaism", "image": "http://www.jewishjournal.com/images/featured/com-giffords-kelly_031315.jpg", "site": "@jewishjournal", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "Jewish Journal, news, jewish, israel, los angeles, Tribe Media Corp, Hollywood, Israel, jewish, judaism, world, nation", "fb": {"app_id": 216180581861512}, "msvalidate.01": "1439B350A4269424970C93B18CEAF6FB", "verify-v1": "5CqSOVc2kyARWwZMAxu3QCpMoZGbB5Nu6xIPWK5MXvQ="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1023\"", "article_summary": "However, both Giffords and Kelly remain strong supporters of the Second Amendment, and they are both gun owners, Kelly said.\nOf course, gun reform is just one of the things that Giffords is working on at the moment.\nA moderate Democrat, Giffords pushed Congress to provide further protection for her state\u2019s southern border and was a vocal supporter of the Affordable Care Act.\nFormer U.S. Rep.
