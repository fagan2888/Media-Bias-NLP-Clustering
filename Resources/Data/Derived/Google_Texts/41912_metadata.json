I just had a lengthy and very heated discussion with both my daughters\u2014at the same time, mind you. My eldest daughter and I went back and forth about nursing school and all the expenses associated with that. And the youngest wants my permission (and signature) to get her driver\u2019s license, even though she is nowhere near ready to do so.\n\nYep, I\u2019m tired from all this bickering. But mostly, my cramped fingers need a rest.\n\nSee, I don\u2019t have actual, face-to-face conversations with my daughters anymore. Oh, no\u2014those days are long gone, Grandma! Nowadays, I parent by way of text messaging.\n\nIt\u2019s a sad, sad state of affairs, this new age of \u201cParenting by Texting.\u201d\n\nTrust me. I resisted texting as long as I could. When I first heard about this texting business, I couldn\u2019t believe that people never really talked on the phone anymore, and I refused to give in to this ridiculous fad.\n\nI mean, what could possibly replace hearing another person\u2019s voice on the other end of the phone? You know, REAL human interaction?\n\nI even asked my daughter\u2014who developed an entire romantic relationship with a boy long-distance by texting with him every day\u2014why teenagers don\u2019t like to talk to their friends on the phone, and she said, \u201cThere are just so many awkward silences. And you don\u2019t get that with texting.\u201d\n\nAwkward silences? That\u2019s what real conversations are about, for goodness sakes! Two people dancing together, and around each other, through words, nuances and timbre. Laughter, sarcasm, fear, anger, doubt, admiration, love, desire \u2026 all these beautiful emotions you can hear in someone\u2019s voice vanish with a typed message. There\u2019s just no soul behind it.\n\nSo I tried to stand defiantly and heroically in front of this oncoming texting train. (Any parents with me on this?) Problem was, the only way I could actually communicate with my children was through the damn text messages. Whenever I tried to call them, the call immediately went to voicemail. But when I sent a text\u2014voila!\u2014like magic, I would get an instant response.\n\n\u201cOh, look! My teenagers are actually talking to me!\u201d I would be giddy with disbelief. Getting a response, any response, from them sure felt good. And soon, like Pavlov\u2019s dog, I was conditioned into becoming a full-time texting mama.\n\nI\u2019ll admit, it is a rather convenient medium. Type a few words, boom, communication accomplished. But I feel so compromised\u2014especially as a writer and an editor. I have spent the majority of my professional life self-righteously cleaning up other people\u2019s writing, punctuation and grammar. Now, like every other texting literate, I just try to find shortcuts and the quickest way to respond. \u201cYou\u201d has become \u201cU;\u201d \u201cTo\u201d and \u201cfor\u201d have morphed into numbers. And \u201cSee you later\u201d has been replaced by \u201cC Ya!\u201d\n\nAnd while it is sometimes easier and less confrontational to flex your parenting muscle through your fingertips, text messages from our children have left many of us parents bewildered and confused. With face-to-face interactions, you know when your kids are being disrespectful to you because you can hear it in their voices. With texting, you don\u2019t know what\u2019s punishable or not.\n\n\u201cDid she accidentally send that text to me in all uppercase letters, or is she sassing back?\u201d\n\nThis new age of text-messaging has weakened our authority as parents. The stern warning of a parent\u2019s booming voice, \u201cDon\u2019t you talk to me in that tone, young lady!\u201d has now been replaced with the texting version: \u201cDON\u2019T YOU GET ALL UPPERCASE-Y WITH ME!\u201d Somehow, it just doesn\u2019t pack the same punch.\n\nIt took me a while to wise up, but I am happy to report that I\u2019ve solved the texting/communication problem with my daughters. I\u2019ve regained some dignity, respect and parental control. How? Well, whenever I\u2019ve had enough of all the back-and-forth texting nonsense, I simply type back two words: \u201cCall me.\u201d\n\nIf my phone doesn\u2019t ring within the time that it takes to text a response (well, I do allow a few extra seconds for the old-fashioned switchboard operator to connect the line), I let my daughters have it!\n\nWith a text message, of course\u2014IN ALL UPPERCASE LETTERS!\n\nLynn Armitage is an enrolled member of the Oneida Tribe of Indians of Wisconsin, who has developed a nasty case of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome in her right forefinger.", "article_metadata": {"description": "I\u2019m exhausted.
