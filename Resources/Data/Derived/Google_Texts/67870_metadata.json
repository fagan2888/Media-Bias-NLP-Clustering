Chang\u2019s Rock and Roll Marathon, I thought of \u201cT\u201d and \u201cG.\u201d \u201cT\u201d, an 18-year-old Apache/African American woman, was raised in a foster home. Her wrists tell a sad tale, desecrated from years of cutting, a form of self-injury. \u201cT\u201d responded to years of bullying by getting into fights and landed in and out of juvenile jail.\n\n\u201cGirls threw trash at me and called me names,\u201d she said when I last saw her. She appeared happy at a ceremony last year where she received a certificate for completing a unit toward obtaining a GED Her older foster brother sat in the audience grinning from ear to ear. They later posed for pictures. \u201cT\u201d let me take a photo of her arms when I promised not to reveal her name.\n\n\u201cG\u201d, 25, Apache and father of two young children, is someone I\u2019d never met. His face visible on a program sits on the desk of a co-worker. \u201cG\u201d committed suicide earlier this year. The program is from his funeral. My heart breaks as I read his obituary.\n\n\u201cHe enjoyed playing the drums, fishing, hunting, firefighting and traditional singing.\u201d The stories of \u201cG\u201d and \u201cT\u201d are not unique. There are countless others who are crying out for help but help may not be easily accessible.\n\n\u201cT\u201d says she often sought counseling while in jail. When she\u2019s not incarcerated, she must find a way to get to a mental health center, some 7 miles away from her home. Without reliable transportation, \u201cT\u201d goes without. It\u2019s unknown whether \u201cG\u201d sought help. Either way, the mental health center was an hour\u2019s drive from where he lived. Proper diagnosis of any mental disorders and treatment may have made a world of difference early in their young lives.\n\nThus the reason I dedicated 26.2 miles to Native youth. The longer I run, the more I push beyond what I believe I\u2019m capable of.\n\nNot just for the \u201cT\u2019s\u201d and \u201cG\u2019s\u201d but also for those who have overcome adversity and are doing amazingly well like Tyler Owens, 19, of the Gila River Indian Community and Nataannii Hatathlie, 19, Navajo. The two are Native youth leaders and college students, who were invited last November to take part in the White House Tribal Nations Conference and met President Barack Obama. Owens told him she wanted to be president just like him.\n\nThe night before the marathon, I listened to a speech by Rick Baker, the legendary cross-country coach at Hopi High School, who boasts a 24-year winning record of state championships. Baker spoke at a spaghetti dinner for Native runners about his legacy of inspiring young runners to dream and visualize victory. He talked about his own running career in the late 1970s at then Haskell Indian Junior College, now a university. \u201cTrust your training,\u201d he said. After 20 miles, months of training didn\u2019t stop my legs from feeling like spaghetti.\n\nMy pain didn\u2019t matter. I focused on the pain of others. As I ran, I prayed. I prayed for the many \u201cT\u2019s\u201d and \u201cG\u2019s\u201d who have hopes and dreams but have lost hope and no longer dream. Statistics on the National Indian Child Welfare Association website show American Indian children have the highest rates of poverty, suicide, mental health and alcohol use disorders.\n\nThanks to organizations like United National Indian Tribal Youth, Inc. (UNITY) that offer life-changing programs, Native youth are empowered to overcome obstacles and take charge of their lives. When they are empowered, they learn to make a difference in the lives of their families and communities. Owens and Hatathlie serve as officers on the National UNITY Council, made up of a network of 137 Native youth councils in 35 states. I used the marathon to raise $10,000 for UNITY.\n\nThis was my second marathon in four years. The first time, I had no agenda. I simply wanted to join the ranks of family marathoners. It is fitting during the last two grueling miles of this race; two teenage nephews served as support runners for me and my sister Millie, who ran her first marathon.\n\n\u201cYou can do it auntie. Come on. You can do it!\u201d said Isaac Stiffaarm, 18. Those simple encouraging words gave me the lift I needed. After I crossed the finish line, four siblings, all White Mountain Apache, and all under the age of 15 greeted me with hugs. Their mother asked me to pose for a picture with them. Seeing their faces full of life were worth that last push to the finish line.\n\nMonths after I took the photo of \u201cT\u201d and her foster brother, her foster brother committed suicide. \u201cT\u201d took it hard but went on to earn her G.E.D. and is out of the juvenile justice system. She\u2019s homeless and is now trying to run her own life marathon. \u201cT\u201d pledges to push beyond what she believes she\u2019s capable of. It won\u2019t be easy, but with the right interventions and encouraging words, young people like \u201cT\u201d will survive and persevere.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Mary Kim Titla, executive director of the United National Indian Tribal Youth, ran a 26.2 mile marathon to raise $10,000 to help Native American youth", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/02/19/running-native-youth-153629", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/mary-kim-title-pf-changs-banner.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Running for Native Youth"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dc": {"title": "Running for Native Youth"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/02/19/running-native-youth-153629", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.creator": "leeanne", "dcterms.date": "2014-02-19T15:00-05:00", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "United National Indian Tribal Youth, UNITY, Running, Native Youth, American Indian Suicide, White House Tribal Nations Conference, Marathon", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.title": "Running for Native Youth"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fced5a\"", "article_summary": "Thanks to organizations like United National Indian Tribal Youth, Inc.
