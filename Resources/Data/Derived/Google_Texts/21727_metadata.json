Again, that latter sentiment is driven by Republicans: Independents think they will be solved by 50-48; moderates by 55-43. By contrast, Republicans overwhelmingly believe they won\u2019t be solved by 72-27. Crucially, young Americans \u2014 who are important to the law\u2019s success \u2013 overwhelmingly believe the problems will be solved (71 percent). Part of the campaign by Republicans to persuade Americans that the law\u2019s doom is inevitable is about dissuading people from enrolling, to turn that into a self fulfilling prophesy.\n\nRepublicans are convinced the law is already a failure. And why wouldn't they? The Fox News bubble has been telling them that for months. But the rest of the country is willing to give it a chance and thinks its problems will probably be solved. When they are, support will go up even higher.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Mother Jones Magazine", "og": {"site_name": "Mother Jones", "description": "Everyone else thinks is still willing to give it a chance.", "title": "Only Republicans believe Obamacare is doomed", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2013/11/only-republicans-believe-obamacare-doomed", "image": "http://www.motherjones.com/files/blog_cnn_poll_obamacare_2013_11_27_0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Only Republicans believe Obamacare is doomed", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2013/11/only-republicans-believe-obamacare-doomed", "image": {"src": "http://www.motherjones.com/files/blog_cnn_poll_obamacare_2013_11_27_0.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.motherjones.com/files/blog_cnn_poll_obamacare_2013_11_27_0.jpg"}, "creator": "kdrum", "site": "@MotherJones", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"admins": "13301307,670317733,1198876232,38509772,106892,2907757,306289,602422192,4101301,513450539"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "Health+Care,Obama", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-150x150.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcab49\"", "article_summary": "By contrast, Republicans overwhelmingly believe they won\u2019t be solved by 72-27.\nCrucially, young Americans \u2014 who are important to the law\u2019s success \u2013 overwhelmingly believe the problems will be solved (71 percent).\nAgain, that latter sentiment is driven by Republicans: Independents think they will be solved by 50-48; moderates by 55-43.\nRepublicans are convinced the law is already a failure.\nBut the rest of the country is willing to give it a chance and thinks its problems will probably be solved."}
