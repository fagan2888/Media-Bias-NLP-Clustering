The Obama administration will pay the Navajo Nation a $554 million settlement, the largest ever, after the U.S. government mishandled the Indian tribe’s natural resources for decades. The deal represents the largest monetary settlement with a single tribe in history.

The settlement will be signed at a ceremony on Friday in the tribe’s capital, Window Rock, Arizona.

Reuters’ Steve Gorman reports:

The deal stems from litigation accusing the government of mismanaging Navajo trust accounts and resources on more than 14 million acres (5.7 million hectares) of land held in trust for the tribe and leased for such purposes as farming, energy development, logging and mining. In return for $554 million, the Navajo agreed to dismiss its lawsuit and forego further litigation over previous U.S. management of Navajo funds and resources held in trust by the federal government. The deal does not preclude the tribe from pursuing future trust claims, or any separate claims over water and uranium pollution on its reservation, Navajo Attorney General Harrison Tsosie said.
