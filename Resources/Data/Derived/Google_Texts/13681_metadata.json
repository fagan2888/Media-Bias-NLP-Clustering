Plus, Nancy Pelosi reveals to First Draft the origins of her love of dark chocolate.\n\nThe 113th Congress on Monday heads into what most lawmakers hope is its final week, but there is plenty to do before it can be relegated to the history books.\n\nMost important, the House and the Senate must find a way to keep the government open past Thursday. A huge spending package funding most of the government is set to become public as early as Monday evening, sending members of Congress and watchdog groups scurrying to find out exactly what it holds. House Republican leaders, undeterred by objections from conservatives, hope to pass the measure by Wednesday and push a fight over President Obama\u2018s new immigration policy into next year.\n\nAt the same time, the Senate needs to take action on a major Pentagon policy measure already passed by the House and a one-year extension of popular tax breaks. Then the question becomes whether Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader, is serious about keeping the Senate around to consider nominations before handing over control to Republicans.\n\nBesides the must-pass bills, Congress has other big issues on its plate.\n\nThe special House committee on the Benghazi, Libya, attacks will hold a hearing on Wednesday on efforts to secure embassy facilities, calling two State Department officials as witnesses. Though a recent report by the House Intelligence Committee found that the C.I.A. and the military acted properly in their response to the attacks, Republicans have indicated they expect to pursue the issue at least through 2015.\n\nSecretary of State John Kerry is scheduled to testify on Tuesday before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the push to authorize using force against the Islamic State. Democratic members of the Senate Intelligence Committee are poised to release a summary of their review of C.I.A. torture of terrorism detainees, if they can overcome final objections from the Obama administration. And Senate Republicans will meet on Tuesday to discuss whether to reverse a Democratic change in filibuster rules.\n\nWith all that in the air, Congress also will find time to litigate the Affordable Care Act. The House Oversight Committee is convening a Tuesday hearing on the health care law, calling Jonathan Gruber, a former administration health care consultant, to grill him about comments he made suggesting that \u201cstupid\u201d voters and government secrecy helped pass the law.\n\nThen Christmas break can begin.\n\nThere\u2019s a new phrase finding its way into the remarks of Speaker John A. Boehner and fellow Republican leaders when they talk about next year: the \u201cnew American Congress.\u201d\n\nMr. Boehner said it at least twice last week, and others have uttered variations. It was notable since the typical formulation would simply be the new Congress or new Republican Congress.\n\nAnd, of course, Congress is always American.\n\nRepublicans say the phrasing is deliberate and is meant to convey the message that the incoming Congress with both the House and the Senate under Republican control will be more responsive to the concerns and priorities of everyday Americans. But they say they don\u2019t expect it to become a frequent element of the speaker\u2019s talking points and won\u2019t rival \u201cwhere are the jobs,\u201d for instance.\n\n\u2014 Carl Hulse\n\nNo Republican has yet made a formal presidential announcement, but American Bridge is not waiting.\n\nThe liberal group is releasing a bound book on Monday of opposition research on the potential Republican presidential field. Covering 20 would-be contenders, the \u201c2016 Scouting Report\u201d is a 194-page compilation of innocuous biographical information alongside unflattering pictures and potentially damaging anecdotes and issue positions. Nearly a third of the tome is endnotes, a signal to reporters who may use the information that it is all sourced.\n\nBrad Woodhouse, the president of American Bridge, called the book \u201cthe most comprehensive early look at a presidential field that has ever been assembled.\u201d\n\nAside from the many period pictures \u2013 a young John R. Kasich with Richard M. Nixon, Nikki R. Haley with Strom Thurmond \u2013 this is mostly \u201cvotes and quotes\u201d information, gleaned from the public record and news media accounts.\n\nIt is also, Mr. Woodhouse notes, only the start. The online version of the book will be continually updated on American Bridge\u2019s website.\n\n\u2014 Jonathan Martin\n\nThere will be no shortage of star power on display on Monday when Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, meets with Hillary Rodham Clinton and Chelsea Clinton for a wildlife conservation reception at the British consul\u2019s residence in New York.\n\nWhile the Clintons are sometimes seen as American royalty, it\u2019s not every day that they mix with the real thing.\n\nOf course, Mrs. Clinton and the duke are not strangers. She had a close relationship with his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales.\n\nAfter Diana\u2019s death in 1997, Mrs. Clinton was chosen to represent the United States in an unofficial capacity at the princess\u2019s funeral. Since it was not a state function, President Bill Clinton did not attend, and there was no official American delegation.\n\nBut Mrs. Clinton was not sent without some political calculation. According to documents released by the Clinton Library last March, Robert A. Bradtke, deputy chief at the American Embassy in London at the time, was concerned about Mrs. Clinton speaking to reporters on her trip.\n\nCalling her the most prominent guest at the funeral, he advised that she make a short statement but take no questions to avoid entanglement in \u201cincreasingly nasty palace politics.\u201d\n\nAs for the duke and his wife, Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, they are expected to avoid the fray of American politics and focus on conservation, the arts and youth education programs on their visit.\n\n\u2014 Alan Rappeport\n\nHillary Rodham Clinton is not the only one meeting with the visiting British royalty. President Obama hosts Prince William at the White House in the morning before heading to George Washington University to be interviewed by the satirist Stephen Colbert for one of the final episodes of \u201cThe Colbert Report.\u201d\n\nSecretary of State John Kerry delivers remarks summarizing a new report on the results of the United States\u2019 conventional weapons destruction program at 10 a.m.\n\nThe Supreme Court hears arguments on a case about whether Amtrak can team with the Federal Railroad Administration to make rules that private railroads must follow.\n\nCocoa prices might be surging, but there\u2019s little doubt about what Representative Nancy Pelosi of California would like for the holidays, or what she\u2019ll be giving.\n\nChocolate. Very dark chocolate.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t \u201ceat chocolate once per day, but constantly,\u201d Ms. Pelosi told First Draft. \u201cIt\u2019s an ongoing thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf there were one food I would have in life, it would be very dark chocolate ice cream,\u201d she said. \u201cIf it were not invented, I would have had to invent it.\u201d\n\nMs. Pelosi, a Democrat, has loved chocolate since her childhood in the Little Italy neighborhood of Baltimore, where she enjoyed parfaits at the corner store and, of course, gelato. At age 5, she tried to dispose a tub of vanilla ice cream \u2014 a gift from her brother. \u201cIt clogged the drains,\u201d she said.\n\nBen and Jerry\u2019s New York Super Fudge Chunk ice cream is her clear favorite. She also keeps on hand Ghirardelli squares \u2014 a home-state product \u2014 and See\u2019s Candies are a go-to for gifts.\n\n\u201cIn the desk, in the purse, readily available at hand,\u201d she said of her stash. \u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful thing.\u201d\n\nShe also believes in chocolate diplomacy. Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio \u201chas given me plenty of delicious chocolate from his district,\u201d she said, noting that she\u2019s a fan of Graeter\u2019s chocolates in Cincinnati.\n\nIn return? \u201cI\u2019ve sent him a number of things.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Alan Rappeport\n\nFar from humbled by a midterm election beating, President Obama is focusing remorselessly on governing objectives and not hiding his derision for Congress.\n\nSome groups at the liberal end of the Democratic Party are worried that the Obama administration\u2019s net neutrality plan will harm for minorities communities by stifling investment in underserved areas.\n\nMayor Bill de Blasio of New York is walking a fine line between empathizing with protesters responding to the Eric Garner case and showing respect for his Police Department.\n\nThe precipitous fall of Bill Cosby is hitting people hard in his hometown, Philadelphia.\n\nThe Times-Picayune of New Orleans reports that Senator Mary L. Landrieu is not ready to retire and speculates that she may run a children\u2019s advocacy group, become a lobbyist or join the Obama administration.\n\nBloomberg News calculates that half of the senators who voted to support the Affordable Care Act will be gone in 2015.\n\nChris Hughes, owner of The New Republic, writes in The Washington Post that he regrets the exodus of writers and editors from the magazine but defended his vision for its future.\n\nGina McCarthy, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, defended the landmark climate deal that the United States reached with China in an interview with The Financial Times.\n\nFormer President George W. Bush told CNN that former President Bill Clinton is his \u201cbrother from another mother,\u201d making Hillary Rodham Clinton like his sister-in-law.", "article_metadata": {"BN": "first-draft", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/first-draft/2014/12/08", "PT": "Blogs", "SCG": "First Draft", "CG": "Politics", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us/politics/firstdraft", "robots": "noodp", "sourceApp": "blogs", "live_stream_endpoint": "http://static01.nyt.com/live-coverage/first-draft/live-stream-endpoint-12082014.jsonp", "keywords": "politics, congress, midterms, elections, 2014, 2016, house, senate, advertising, political advertising, campaign finance, senator, Obama, Boehner, Clinton, Hillary, Hillary Clinton, Reid, McConnell, Christie, Paul, Washington, capitol", "ad_sensitivity": "noxxl", "article": {"section": "Politics"}, "nyt_active_day": 0, "twitter": {"description": "Political News, Now.", "title": "First Draft", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2014/12/08/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/nytdesign/2014/politics/logo-flag-150.png", "site": "@NYTPolitics", "card": "summary"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9f69\"", "article_summary": "It was notable since the typical formulation would simply be the new Congress or new Republican Congress.\nPlus, Nancy Pelosi reveals to First Draft the origins of her love of dark chocolate.\nShe doesn\u2019t \u201ceat chocolate once per day, but constantly,\u201d Ms. Pelosi told First Draft.\nSince it was not a state function, President Bill Clinton did not attend, and there was no official American delegation.\nSecretary of State John Kerry is scheduled to testify on Tuesday before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the push to authorize using force against the Islamic State."}
