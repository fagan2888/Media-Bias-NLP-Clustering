Which, ironically, was sort of a stupid thing to say on camera.\n\nBy now there are so many tapes of Gruber explaining how Obamacare fooled stupid Americans that they\u2019re being released as a boxed set in time for Christmas.\n\nGruber, who will hereafter be known as \u201cthe architect of Obamacare,\u201d said:\n\n\u201cIf you had a law which said that healthy people are going to pay in \u2014 if you made it explicit that healthy people pay in and sick people get money, it would not have passed. \u2026 Lack of transparency is a huge political advantage. And basically, call it the stupidity of the American voter or whatever, but basically that was really, really critical to getting the thing to pass.\u201d\n\nThe Downing Street memo consisted of minutes from a July 2002 meeting of British labor, defense and intelligence officials during the run-up to the Iraq War, in which the MI6 head, Richard Dearlove, reportedly said that \u201cBush wanted to remove Saddam Hussein, through military action, justified by the conjunction of terrorism and WMD. But the intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy.\u201d\n\nThese notes from a British cabinet meeting were called the smoking gun of Bush\u2019s lying his way into war.\n\nThe Downing Street memo was written about in dozens of New York Times articles \u2014 including six hysterical Frank Rich op-eds. It has been mentioned more than a hundred times in The Washington Post. It was covered on ABC\u2019s \u201cNightline,\u201d by George Stephanopoulos on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d \u2014 even on the \u201cToday\u201d show. It was discussed nightly on MSNBC, where Keith Olbermann covered it like it was Kim Kardashian and he was the E! Network.\n\nBy contrast, this week, NBC\u2019s Chuck Todd dismissed the Gruber tapes as \u201ca political story\u201d and The New York Times said of Gruber: \u201cIn truth, his role was limited.\u201d (NYT, March 28, 2012: \u201cMr. Gruber helped the administration put together the basic principles of the proposal, (then) the White House lent him to Capitol Hill to help congressional staff members draft the specifics of the legislation.\u201d)\n\nBut when the Downing Street memo came out, conservatives weren\u2019t allowed to say, Yeah, well, the British memo writer didn\u2019t have anything to do with the president\u2019s decision to go to war \u2014 even though that guy really didn\u2019t have anything to do with it.\n\nThose weren\u2019t Tony Blair\u2019s notes. They were a secretary\u2019s interpretation of the MI6 chief\u2019s interpretation of the Bush administration\u2019s argument to the United Nations. It\u2019s like a movie review, written by someone who knew someone who had seen the movie.\n\nThe memo writer also wasn\u2019t being paid $400,000 by the Bush administration to make Iraq War policy. Jonathan Gruber was paid that much \u2014 plus another several million from the states \u2014 to design Obamacare.\n\nYou don\u2019t pay a half-million dollars to someone who is only peripherally involved in making policy. (Unless we\u2019re talking about Obama himself.)\n\nThere was no tape of Bush and Blair running around saying: Trust this guy \u2014 the memo writer is our guide! But that\u2019s what Obama, Nancy Pelosi, then-Sen. John Kerry and other Democrats said about Gruber.\n\n\u2014 Kerry on Oct. 1, 2009: \u201c(Gruber) has been our guide on a lot of this \u2026\u201d\n\n\u2014 Pelosi on Nov. 5, 2009: \u201cOur bill brings down rates \u2014 I don\u2019t know if you have seen Jonathan Gruber\u2019s MIT analysis \u2026\u201d\n\n\u2014 Obama\u2019s Organizing for Action website, until the tapes surfaced: \u201cJon Gruber, who helped write Obamacare \u2026\u201d\n\nGruber had more than a dozen meetings at the White House during the drafting of Obamacare. The Downing Street memo writer had no meetings at the Bush White House.
