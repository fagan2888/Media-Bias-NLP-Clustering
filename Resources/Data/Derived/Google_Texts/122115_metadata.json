And according to The Weekly Standard\u2019s Jim Swift, such programs are just like the \u201cbriefcase at the end of \u2018Dumb and Dumber'\u201d \u2014 full of IOUs.\n\nSwift, an assistant editor at The Weekly Standard, talked about how entitlements \u2014 and their dwindling trust funds \u2014 affect Millennials during an appearance on Fox Business Network\u2019s \u201cThe Independents\u201d on Friday. Though young people are contributing to entitlement programs, Swift warned that most are vastly unaware of the state of such funds, from social security to Medicare.\n\n\u201cMost Millennials understand that these programs are not solvent, that they\u2019re not hunky dory,\u201d he said. \u201cBut what they don\u2019t understand is that the trust fund is like the briefcase at the end of \u2018Dumb and Dumber.'\u201d\n\nExperts warn that the social security trust fund will run out by 2033 \u2014 long before most Millennials will be eligible to receive the benefit. The Medicare hospital fund, however, is expected to diminish by 2026, an annual report from the federal government found.\n\nSince social security was reformed 30 years ago, the program has been operating on auto pilot, adjusting for inflation and the cost of living.\n\nCongress has taken little action to reform these entitlement programs, and with the Obamacare now thrown into the mix, Millennials are going to continue subsidizing things like healthcare for the elderly.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a present-day a** biter,\u201d Lisa Kennedy Montgomery, host of \u201cThe Independents,\u201d said.\n\nAnd Swift concurred. But, he noted that watching the cost of premiums increase \u2014 as they have under the Affordable Care Act \u2014 may direct Millennials\u2019 attention toward entitlements.\n\n\u201cThey now, when they get off their parents\u2019 insurance at age 26, have to go out and get their own, assuming they can get it through their employer,\u201d Swift said. \u201cAnd now they have to see how they pay for this on their own and this may be a later entry into adulthood.\u201d\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, young people pay more for premiums to subsidize the cost of healthcare for the elderly. And their participation is crucial to the law\u2019s success.\n\nWatch Swift talk entitlements and Millennials below.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "As young Americans grapple with an entitlement system poised for bankruptcy, Obamacare serves as another fund Millennials contribute substantially to.
