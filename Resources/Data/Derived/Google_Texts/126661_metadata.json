Barack Obama just minutes before he delivered the keynote address at the 2004 Democratic National Convention in Boston:\n\nAfter Obama and I slipped through a security checkpoint and he momentarily broke free from the entourage, I sidled up to him and told him that he seemed to be impressing many people of influence in this rarefied atmosphere. Obama, his gaze fixed directly ahead, never broke his stride. \u201cI'm LeBron, baby,\u201d he replied, referring to LeBron James, the phenomenally talented teenager who at the time was shooting the lights out in the National Basketball Association. \u201cI can play on this level. I got some game.\u201d\n\nObama was right. He had some game, delivering a breakthrough speech that, in an analysis by David Bernstein, senior editor at Chicago magazine, \u201ccaptured the nation's attention and opened the way for a run at the presidency.\u201d\n\nPrior to that speech, \u201cthe idea of Obama running for president would have been laughable; he was a lowly state senator from Chicago's Hyde Park,\u201d wrote Bernstein. \u201cAfter the speech, observers from across the political world hailed the address as an instant classic, and Obama was drawing comparisons (deservedly or not) to Martin Luther King Jr. and John F. Kennedy.\u201d\n\nValerie Jarrett, longtime Obama friend and currently a senior adviser to the president, said of Obama's 2004 convention speech: \u201cIt changed his life.\u201d\n\nDavid Remnick, editor of The New Yorker, quotes Jarrett in his biography of Obama, The Bridge: The Life and Rise of Barack Obama, published in 2010. \u201c\u2018I think Barack knew that he had God-given talents that were extraordinary,' stated Jarrett. 'He knows exactly how smart he is.... He knows how perceptive he is. He knows what a good reader of people he is. And he knows that he has the ability \u2014 the extraordinary, uncanny ability \u2014 to take a thousand different perspectives, digest them and make sense out of them, and I think that he has never been challenged intellectually.... He's been bored to death his whole life. He's just too talented to do what ordinary people do.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhat's the meaning of Jarrett's analysis, aside from providing insight into how adoration may be linked to attaining employment?\n\nObama claimed he didn't know about the bugging of German Chancellor Angela Merkel, or about the National Security Agency snooping on other allied leaders and tens of millions of foreign citizens, or about the Fast and Furious gun-running debacle, or about the facts surrounding the attack on the American outpost in Benghazi, or about the flaws with the ObamaCare website, or about the IRS holding up tax-exempt applications of tea party groups prior to the 2012 election.\n\nPerhaps Obama \u2014 perennially \u201cbored to death\u201d and with talents so \u201cextraordinary\u201d that he has \u201cnever been challenged intellectually\u201d \u2014 found all of the above issues cerebrally unchallenging and intrinsically boring. Said Obama, regarding the IRS' targeting of tea party groups, \u201cI first learned about it from the same news reports that I think most people learned about this.\u201d\n\nThe German periodical Bild am Sonntag, citing U.S. intelligence sources, reported that the NSA chief, Army Gen. Keith Alexander, briefed Obama on the Merkel wiretaps in 2010. Obama can't recall the briefing. Perhaps he was \u201cbored to death\u201d and/or inadequately \u201cchallenged intellectually\u201d by Gen. Alexander's briefing.\n\n\n\nRalph R.
