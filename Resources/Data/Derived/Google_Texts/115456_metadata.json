In that case, you'll have to file Form 8965, which allows you to claim an exemption from the requirement to have insurance or calculate your penalty for the months that you weren't covered.\n\nOn page 2 of the instructions for Form 8965 you'll see a lengthy list of the coverage exemptions for which you may qualify. If your income is below the filing threshold ($10,150 for an individual in 2014), for example, you're exempt. Likewise if coverage was unaffordable because it would have cost more than 8 percent of your household income or you had a short coverage gap of less than three consecutive months.\n\nSome of the exemptions have to be granted by the health insurance marketplace, but many can be claimed right on your tax return. The tax form instructions spell out where to claim each type of exemption.\n\nIf you do have to go to the marketplace to get an exemption, be aware that it may take two weeks or more to process the application. Act promptly if you want to avoid bumping up against the April 15 filing deadline, says Timothy Jost, a professor and specialist in health law at Washington and Lee University who is an expert on the health law.\n\nIf you don't qualify for a coverage exemption\n\nIf none of the exemptions apply to you, you'll owe a penalty of either $95 or 1 percent of your income above the tax filing threshold, whichever is greater. The penalty will be prorated if you had coverage for at least part of the year. The instructions for Form 8965 include a worksheet to calculate the amount of your penalty.\n\nIf you received a premium tax credit for a marketplace plan\n\nUnder the health law, people with incomes between 100 and 400 percent of the federal poverty level ($11,490 to $45,960 for an individual in 2013) could qualify for premium tax credits for 2014 coverage bought on the exchanges.\n\nThe marketplace determined the amount of premium tax credit people were eligible for based on their estimated income. At tax time those estimates will be reconciled against actual income. People whose income was lower than they estimated may have received too little in advance premium tax credits. They can claim the amount they're owed as a tax refund.\n\nPeople whose income was higher than estimated and received too much in advance premium tax credits will generally have to pay back some or all of it.\n\nIf you bought a plan on the marketplace, you'll receive a Form 1095-A from your state marketplace by Jan. 31 that spells out how much your insurer received in advance premium tax credits. You'll use that information to complete Form 8962.\n\nAssuming the information on the form is correct, \"It should be easy to reconcile,\" says Judith Solomon, vice president for health policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Tax software programs and tax preparers also should know how to make the calculations, she said.\n\nMany lower income consumers and seniors can get free tax preparation assistance through the IRS Volunteer Income Tax Assistance and the Tax Counseling for the Elderly programs\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "NPR Health", "description": "In addition to the normal thrills and chills of the income tax filing season, this year people will have the added excitement of figuring out how the", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://health.wusf.usf.edu/post/tax-time-gets-new-ritual-proof-health-insurance", "type": "article", "description": "In addition to the normal thrills and chills of the income tax filing season, this year people will have the added excitement of figuring out how the", "title": "Tax Time Gets New Ritual: Proof Of Health Insurance"}, "org_id": 105043435, "twitter": {"site": "@HealthNewsFL", "card": "summary"}, "author": "Michelle Andrews", "wordCount": 796, "dc": {"title": "Tax Time Gets New Ritual: Proof Of Health Insurance"}, "nid": 9197, "datePublished": "2015-01-13", "story_id": 376783972, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Many lower income consumers and seniors can get free tax preparation assistance through the IRS Volunteer Income Tax Assistance and the Tax Counseling for the Elderly programs\nThe tax form instructions spell out where to claim each type of exemption.\nSome of the exemptions have to be granted by the health insurance marketplace, but many can be claimed right on your tax return.\nThe marketplace determined the amount of premium tax credit people were eligible for based on their estimated income.\nIn addition to the normal thrills and chills of the income tax filing season, this year people will have the added excitement of figuring out how the health law figures in their 2014 taxes."}
