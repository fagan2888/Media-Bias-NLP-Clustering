While parody and criticism are textbook examples of fair use, they are not the only ones. The statute explicitly includes research and educational uses, which simply use the original without altering or necessarily commenting upon it. Other established fair uses, like making home recordings off the television, do not require any commentary to be lawful.\n\nThe complex and intricate rules of copyright law increasingly become a trap for the unwary, now that computers automatically make copies (often just temporarily) of all the data they process, from DVDs to MP3s to web pages. (A reader viewing this letter on nytimes.com is making a reproduction of this copyrighted work.)\n\nFair use is, among other things, an essential safety valve that prevents the law from making infringers of us all. A handful of cases decided against photographers might at most suggest the need for them to appeal those cases, not rework a fundamental piece of the law that protects millions from unjust liability.\n\nSHERWIN SIY\n\nWashington, Feb. 22, 2014\n\nThe writer is vice president, legal affairs, for Public Knowledge, which works to preserve the openness of the Internet.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20140304194632, "twitter": {"description": "A lawyer discusses legal issues surrounding the use of copyrighted art.", "title": "How to Define \u2018Fair Use\u2019", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/05/opinion/how-to-define-fair-use.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002749426"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/05/opinion/how-to-define-fair-use.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002749426", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/05/opinion/how-to-define-fair-use.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion", "hdl_p": "How to Define \u2018Fair Use\u2019", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "March 4, 2014", "edt": "The New York Times on the Web", "keywords": "Copyrights and Copyright Violations,Photography,Law and Legislation,United States", "news_keywords": "Photography", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "A lawyer discusses legal issues surrounding the use of copyrighted art.", "tom": "Letter", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "description": "A lawyer discusses legal issues surrounding the use of copyrighted art.", "CG": "opinion", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "March 4, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Letter", "article": {"section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/opinion/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified": "2014-03-05", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "United States", "published": "2014-03-04", "section-taxonomy-id": "AD8090D7-4137-4D71-84C8-70DA3BD89778"}, "geo": "United States", "slug": "lweb05fair", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140305030203, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/05/opinion/how-to-define-fair-use.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article", "description": "A lawyer discusses legal issues surrounding the use of copyrighted art.", "title": "How to Define \u2018Fair Use\u2019"}, "pdate": 20140304, "des": "Law and Legislation", "articleid": 100000002749426, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "How to Define \u2018Fair Use\u2019", "col": "Letter", "PST": "Letter"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9001\"", "article_summary": "Other established fair uses, like making home recordings off the television, do not require any commentary to be lawful.\nTo the Editor:In \u201cPhotographers Band Together to Protect Work in \u2018Fair Use\u2019 Cases\u201d (Arts pages, Feb. 22), you mention an appeals court\u2019s holding that under \u201cfair use,\u201d a new work does not need to comment directly on the original work, and photographers\u2019 worries that this expands fair use beyond its original bounds.\nFair use is, among other things, an essential safety valve that prevents the law from making infringers of us all.\nFair use has, from its beginnings, never required the use to be a commentary, criticism or parody.\nWhile parody and criticism are textbook examples of fair use, they are not the only ones."}
