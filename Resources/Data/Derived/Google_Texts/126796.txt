Obama supporters continue to find out the hard way that the reality of Obamacare stands in stark contrast to the rhetorical promises of Obamacare.

Case in point: Obama supporter Catherine Keefe. On Wednesday, the Washington Post published an essay by Keefe lamenting the ways “Obamacare has hurt my family.” Keefe says her husband Jim was recovering from open-heart surgery when Obama was elected and that she was “elated” that Obama’s promise of health care reform would benefit she and her husband–a hope that never came to fruition.

First came the cancellation of both Keefe and her husband’s insurance plans, a pain experienced by nearly 5 million Americans whose plans were canceled by Obamacare. Keefe says Obama’s now-infamous broken promise–“If you like your plan, you can keep your plan”–was her and her husband’s “biggest disappointment.”

Next came the realization that another Obama promise–“If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor”–was also untrue.

Finally, Keefe says the endless hassles, higher premiums, and bureaucratic hoop jumping leaves her and her husband with nagging doubts and worries about what the future portends.

“What Obamacare hasn’t eliminated is worry: We’re deeply concerned about our ability to get quality medical care from doctors we trust,” writes Keefe. “The day may soon come when we can’t afford the plans our doctors accept.”

According to the RealClearPolitics average of polls, just 38% of Americans support Obamacare.
