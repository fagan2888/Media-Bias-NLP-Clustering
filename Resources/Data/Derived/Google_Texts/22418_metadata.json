But long before the cast is ready to come off, you lose your health insurance, ending your ability to pay for doctor\u2019s visits.\n\nYou hobble around in an attempt to resume your normal activities, but without consistent care, you push yourself too hard and compromise your recovery, sidelining you from daily life once again. And so the cycle continues.\n\nA similar problem \u2014 less visible but crippling in a different way \u2014 is faced by millions of vulnerable Americans every day. Inmates with a history of mental health problems \u2013 and that\u2019s almost 65 percent of them \u2013 or another long-term medical problem, like substance abuse, receive care on a regular basis while incarcerated. But upon release, which is often after just a few months of jail time, their connection to treatment vanishes.\n\nWhat happens next? Without regular care, they are far more likely to wind up back where they started: in jail. Indeed, nearly a quarter of all inmates with mental health problems have been in jail more than three times, compared to about 20 percent among those without those health issues. Once these inmates are no longer covered by the health care within the jail system, it is difficult for them to resume treatment, especially since it is uncommon for local jails to have strong collaborative relationships with health organizations in the community.\n\nThis is why inmate health care reform advocates stress the importance of \u201ccontinuity of care.\u201d If jails and their surrounding communities could work together to improve communication and help former inmates receive needed care, some argue that recidivism would drop and overall health care costs would go down. For example, a 2008 study by the Justice Policy Institute suggests that a strong system of community-based substance abuse treatment lowers both crime rates and corrections costs.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, which went into effect at the beginning of 2014, may spark a move toward reform. In an essay published in the March issue of Health Affairs, George Washington University professors Marsha Regenstein and Sara Rosenbaum argue that new policies enacted by that law may create incentives for communities and jails to improve the quality and consistency of care for incarcerated individuals, those previously incarcerated or those about to enter jail.\n\nRegenstein and Rosenbaum write that the expansion of Medicaid and increased health insurance coverage will allow more former inmates to get the medical care they need. With these new policies, a number of solutions to health care challenges become more viable, such as increased collaboration between jails and communities, a transition to electronic record-keeping and information exchanges and better health coverage opportunities for former inmates.\n\n\u201cThere is evidence that \u2026 if someone leaves jail and goes right into a stable health care situation, that recidivism is lower, that overall costs are lower, that individuals are using health services more efficiently.\u201d Regenstein said. \u201cSo it\u2019s kind of a win-win-win for all the parties involved.\u201d\n\nRegenstein sat down with PBS NewsHour last week to discuss the implications that the Affordable Care Act will have on health care in America\u2019s jails.\n\nNEWSHOUR: Your paper explores how the Affordable Care Act will affect people in jail. Can you explain the results of your study?\n\nMARSHA REGENSTEIN: The Affordable Care Act includes several provisions that should have a profound and very positive impact on individuals who have spent some time in jail. So there are more than 10 million people who spend some amount of time in jail, usually for a short period of time, and the vast majority of those individuals are poor and have had very hard times getting health insurance. And they\u2019re also, as a group, disproportionately likely to have chronic conditions, especially mental health and substance abuse problems.\n\nPrior to the ACA, (Medicaid) did not cover individuals who are adults without dependent children, regardless of how poor they were, unless they qualified as having a disability. There are some states that have some small programs for so-called childless adults. But the ACA really made drastic changes in this area by getting rid of any of the categorical requirements.\n\nCoverage for Medicaid, if you are in an expansion state, is based on a couple of things, like residency \u2013 you have to be a legal resident of the state, and you have to be a citizen or a legal resident who has been in this country for more than five years to qualify for Medicaid\u2026. And with Medicaid comes access to a range of benefits \u2013 primary care, specialty, etc. \u2013 but the ACA also requires public and private insurance to cover certain essential benefits, including mental health and substance abuse benefits.\n\nSo it\u2019s like a double-win for a lot of the population who have spent some time in jail, have mental health or substance abuse problems, have never had health insurance and have never had access to these services. That\u2019s on the Medicaid side.\n\nAnd on the private insurance side, it also makes available participation in state health insurance exchanges, the marketplaces, for people who qualify who are not eligible for Medicaid, but whose income will allow them to qualify to purchase health insurance, often subsidized. So the coverage opportunities and access to a whole range of health services is really a huge benefit.\n\nNEWSHOUR: Can you explain how Medicaid, both before and after the Affordable Care Act, doesn\u2019t cover people who are currently in jail?\n\nMARSHA REGENSTEIN: People who have been in jail have always been eligible for Medicaid or Medicare if they fell into other eligibility categories. So there\u2019s never been a prohibition for someone who spent time in jail, but in jail there is an exclusion where there are no federal benefits that can accrue to the individual while in jail or prison, and that doesn\u2019t change.\n\nThe difference is there\u2019s now an incentive on the part of communities as a whole, and jails as part of those communities, who have an obligation to provide health services to those inmates. But (the jails) really were never set up to be health service organizations.\n\nIf someone comes into a jail with prior health arrangements, and then can leave the jail going back to certain health arrangements, there\u2019s a greater incentive on the part of the jail to get that person\u2019s health records, to maintain them \u2026 to try to maintain their health care while they\u2019re in jail, which is the responsibility of the jail, and then to do some coordinated discharge planning to make sure that they get into those stable arrangements so the care is coordinated.\n\nThere is evidence that if that happens \u2013 if someone leaves jail and goes right into a stable health care situation \u2013 that recidivism is lower, that overall costs are lower, that individuals are using health services more efficiently. So it\u2019s kind of a win-win-win for all the parties involved.\n\nJails sometimes will cut off someone\u2019s Medicaid if they (are incarcerated), and they\u2019re there for more than, let\u2019s say, a month. But there\u2019s an incentive \u2013 and (Centers for Medicaid & Medicare Services) has supported this and encouraged this \u2013 for jails to just suspend Medicaid so that the very moment someone gets out, their Medicaid is reactivated, and they can go right back into a good, stable relationship with a health care provider.\n\nNEWSHOUR: What specifically do the communities have to gain by easing this transition, by creating a better infrastructure?\n\nMARSHA REGENSTEIN: There\u2019s every reason for a community to want people who have physical health problems, mental health problems or substance abuse problems, to be able to be in care and getting good treatment.\n\nA lot of people who are arrested and going to jail are, at the time of arrest, using alcohol or drugs. And there\u2019s a certainly a relationship between alcohol and drug use and mental health problems and repeat incarcerations. So if communities and the health care systems can get people into coordinated arrangements, it\u2019s a much more efficient use of health services, it\u2019s better for the individual and it\u2019s a safer environment.\n\nWhen I say \u201cincentives,\u201d there aren\u2019t direct financial incentives for the jail to do this. It\u2019s been a very frustrating and difficult process for jails to find effective health care arrangements for people leaving jail, and many have started doing discharge planning. But if there\u2019s no health coverage for that person when they leave jail, it\u2019s just a very hard situation to try to manage that transition.\n\nNEWSHOUR: Up until this point, why has in-jail health care been so self-contained?\n\nMARSHA REGENSTEIN: There\u2019s very little known about really what\u2019s happening in jails in terms of the quality of health care that\u2019s delivered. There are no systems of reporting that are required to sort of take the pulse on what people are getting, how quickly they\u2019re getting care, what the quality of the care is \u2013 certainly no system nationally. There are Bureau of Justice periodic surveys of inmates, but they\u2019re very dated. The latest one was in 2002. It gathered quite a bit of information about the experiences of individuals \u2013 why they ended up in jail \u2013 and very little about the health profiles of the people in jail.\n\nIn terms of really understanding the quality of health care in jails, it\u2019s a pretty highly charged area. There are issues around inmates\u2019 rights, I think, that maybe make it more difficult to find out what\u2019s going on. There are, I guess, liability issues wrapped up in this. But much more information needs to be known about exactly what the health care is in jails.\n\nWhen a lot of mental health institutions closed in the last several decades, and community mental health services were thought to be the replacement, the investment in those community health services was never robust enough to really become the provider that it needed to be to handle mental health and substance abuse services. And so a lot of the large prisons and jails in this country are essentially housing the highest number of patients with mental health and substance abuse problems, without really understanding whether they\u2019re the services that are necessary to take care of them. And clearly, it does not appear to be sufficient. That\u2019s probably an understatement. The quality of health care in many, many jails is just abysmal.\n\nNEWSHOUR: Are you optimistic that this reform will eventually become widespread?\n\nMARSHA REGENSTEIN: I think it\u2019s going to be hard. It\u2019s always hard when you change a system of care, right? \u2026 But I think slowly communities will move in that direction. Counties and county criminal justice departments are aware of this. And there\u2019s so much on everybody\u2019s plate in terms of health care reform that it may take a while for this to happen. Like I said, jails are not designed to be health care organizations. They\u2019ve been saddled, too, with the responsibility, and some are really trying to meet that, and some are woefully behind. So I think there\u2019ll be some innovators, as there usually are in the field, and they may be able to develop some systems that other jails around the country can use as models. But I think it will be challenging.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Inmates with a history of mental illness or substance abuse receive care on a regular basis while incarcerated.
