But they disagree on how to proceed. Some want to trigger what would amount to a game of chicken that could lead to another federal government shutdown. But most do not want to let Obama\u2019s move drastically affect what they\u2019ll do, fearing overreach that could plummet views of the party ahead of the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThen there are some who think the GOP response should be as extreme as Obama\u2019s unilateral action. Here are seven of the more outlandish GOP reactions to Obama\u2019s actions:\n\nMike Huckabee, former Arkansas governor and potential 2016 presidential candidate\n\nHuckabee offered this colorful metaphor in a tweet reacting to the speech:\n\nIllegal immigrants had watch parties for Obama\u2019s speech. Considering he thinks he\u2019s Caesar, wouldn\u2019t toga parties be more appropriate? \u2014 Gov. Mike Huckabee (@GovMikeHuckabee) November 21, 2014\n\nSen. Tom Coburn (R-Oklahoma)\n\nIn an interview with USA Today on Wednesday, Coburn invoked protests in Ferguson and warned of potential violence in response to Obama\u2019s announcement.\n\n\u201cThe country\u2019s going to go nuts, because they\u2019re going to see it as a move outside the authority of the president, and it\u2019s going to be a very serious situation,\u201d Coburn told the paper. \u201cYou\u2019re going to see \u2014 hopefully not \u2014 but you could see instances of anarchy. \u2026 You could see violence.\u201d\n\nRep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minnesota)\n\nBachmann, who is retiring at the end of this Congress, speculated on Wednesday that Obama was hatching a plot to enroll millions of new Democratic voters \u2014 and called undocumented immigrants \u201cilliterate.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe president has a very single-minded vision. He\u2019s looking at new voters for 2016,\u201d Bachmann said. \u201c\u2026 People do vote without being a citizen. It\u2019s a wink and a nod, we all know it\u2019s going to happen.\u201d\n\nRep. Mo Brooks (R-Alabama)\n\nBrooks told Slate\u2019s Betsy Woodruff that Obama should perhaps face impeachment, or even jail time.\n\n\u201cAt some point, you have to evaluate whether the president\u2019s conduct aids or abets, encourages, or entices foreigners to unlawfully cross into the United States of America,\u201d he continued. \u201cThat has a five-year in-jail penalty associated with it.\u201d\n\nRep. Steve King (R-Iowa)\n\nKing, famous for his eyebrow-raising statements about undocumented immigrants, also said Republicans shouldn\u2019t rule out impeachment, but said it should be considered only as a \u201clast option.\u201d\n\nSteve Kobach, Kansas Secretary of State\n\nKobach suggested on his weekly radio show that Obama\u2019s general lawlessness could lead to what he called \u201cethnic cleansing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat protects us in America from any kind of ethnic cleansing is the rule of law, of course,\u201d Kobach said. \u201cAnd the rule of law used to be unassailable, used to be taken for granted in America. And now, of course, we have a president who disregards the law when it suits his interests. So, while I normally would answer that by saying, \u2018Steve, of course we have the rule of law, that could never happen in America,\u2019 I wonder what could happen. I still don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to happen in America, but I have to admit, things are strange and they are happening.\u201d\n\nNewt Gingrich, former presidential candidate and House Speaker\n\nAppearing on CNN immediately after Obama\u2019s speech, Gingrich called Obama\u2019s announcement a \u201cGruber speech,\u201d referencing a controversy involving one of the architects of the Affordable Care Act that has popped up in headlines recently. The ties between Obama\u2019s actions and the comments of the architect, Jonathan Gruber, weren\u2019t immediately clear.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://fusion.net/wp-content/themes/fusion-theme/assets/images/favicons/browserconfig.xml?v=1462067892199", "msapplication-TileColor": "#da532c", "pocket-site-verification": "81a5587d6c56043280b2554922f43d", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Fusion", "description": "Republicans are still plotting a response strategy to President Barack Obama\u2019s executive actions to make changes to the nation\u2019s immigration system.", "title": "7 Outlandish Freakouts to Obama\u2019s Immigration Order", "url": "http://fusion.net/story/29021/obama-immigration-executive-action-republican-reaction/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://i1.wp.com/fusion.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/gty_king_130719_wmain.jpg?resize=1200%2C630&quality=80&strip=all", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Republicans are still plotting a response strategy to President Barack Obama\u2019s executive actions to make changes to the nation\u2019s immigration system.", "title": "7 outlandish freakouts to Obama\u2019s immigration order", "url": "http://fusion.net/story/29021/obama-immigration-executive-action-republican-reaction/", "image": "http://i1.wp.com/fusion.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/gty_king_130719_wmain.jpg?resize=560%2C294&quality=80&strip=all", "site": "@fusion", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Fusion.net", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6a5260d31ead375c331934cb6df4833"}, "fb": {"app_id": 796694167041552}, "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://fusion.net/wp-content/themes/fusion-theme/assets/images/favicons/mstile-144x144.png?v=1462067892199", "application-name": "Fusion.net", "msvalidate.01": "0EABD001D404EA9DDE2025E9E4F14CAF", "google-site-verification": "BKw_9qDU04u2w1WoNF53fplAwWXVK_DJ1b6rZDR5u-M", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Republicans are still plotting a response strategy to President Barack Obama\u2019s executive actions to make changes to the nation\u2019s immigration system."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcae11\"", "article_summary": "Republicans are still plotting a response strategy to President Barack Obama\u2019s executive actions to make changes to the nation\u2019s immigration system.\nHere are seven of the more outlandish GOP reactions to Obama\u2019s actions:Mike Huckabee, former Arkansas governor and potential 2016 presidential candidateHuckabee offered this colorful metaphor in a tweet reacting to the speech:Illegal immigrants had watch parties for Obama\u2019s speech.\nThen there are some who think the GOP response should be as extreme as Obama\u2019s unilateral action.\nThe ties between Obama\u2019s actions and the comments of the architect, Jonathan Gruber, weren\u2019t immediately clear.\nSome want to trigger what would amount to a game of chicken that could lead to another federal government shutdown."}
