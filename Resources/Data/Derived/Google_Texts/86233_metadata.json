The video argues that she beat Ohio Governor John Kasich and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie in Iowa, and that she is tied with establishment darling Jeb Bush in delegates. A portion of the video declares she takes on Democratic party presidential candidate Hillary Clinton \u201clike nobody else can,\u201d perhaps a reference to Fiorina\u2019s status as the only woman in the race for the GOP nomination.\n\nUsing Disney references, the video says, \u201cWe\u2019ve FROZEN Carly Out.\u201d The ABC logo later appears with a Disney Mickey Mouse hat and the word \u201cRigged,\u201d with a narrator saying, \u201cAll part of our Mickey Mouse operation.\u201d\n\nThe video ends with the hashtag #LetCarlyDebate.\n\nCARLY for America Executive Director Stephen DeMaura said upon the release of the video:\n\nWe made a parody of ABC and Disney just like they made a parody out of our debate process. The arbitrary standards set by ABC lack grounding or knowledge of the political process or respect for the role New Hampshire voters play in the First in the Nation Primary. Despite not being included in the last debate Carly beat two establishment favorites and she will do so again on Tuesday. The standards set by Disney\u2019s ABC are so arbitrary and nonsensical, one is left to believe they must be purposeful to protect Hillary Clinton from her most effective critic. The Manhattan media executives need to swallow their pride and do what is right by voters. Disney, ABC, and the RNC need to stop rigging the game and must listen to voters and include Carly.\n\nFollow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana.", "article_metadata": {"description": "CARLY for America makes a last-minute\u00a0parody video pitch to get Carly Fiorina on the main stage for ABC's debate by releasing\u00a0an \u201cAnybody but Carly\u201d promo.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "CARLY for America makes a last-minute\u00a0parody video pitch to get Carly Fiorina on the main stage for ABC's debate by releasing\u00a0an \u201cAnybody but Carly\u201d promo.", "title": "Watch: \u2018Anybody but Carly\u2019 Fiorina Parody Video: Last-Minute Attempt at New Hampshire Debate Main Stage - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 475, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/02/Let-Carly-Debate-Twitter.jpg", "height": 356}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/02/06/fiorina-launches-anybody-but-carly-parody-video-in-last-minute-attempt-at-debate-mainstage/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "CARLY for America makes a last-minute\u00a0parody video pitch to get Carly Fiorina on the main stage for ABC's debate by releasing\u00a0an \u201cAnybody but Carly\u201d promo.", "title": "Watch: \u2018Anybody but Carly\u2019 Fiorina Parody Video: Last-Minute Attempt at New Hampshire Debate Main Stage - Breitbart", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/02/Let-Carly-Debate-Twitter.jpg", "creator": "@michellediana", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "#LetCarlyDebate, 2016, Carly Fiorina, Carly for America, Chris Christie, John Kasich, New Hampshire, republican debate,2016 Presidential Race, Big Government,Fiorina", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2016-02-06T11:11:33-07:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/michdimoo", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "republican debate", "categories": "Big Government,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "Despite not being included in the last debate Carly beat two establishment favorites and she will do so again on Tuesday.\n\u201cOn Anybody but Carly, we rig the game.\u201dSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERAnybody but Carly from CARLY for America on Vimeo.\nDisney, ABC, and the RNC need to stop rigging the game and must listen to voters and include Carly.\nFiorina has been fighting for a position on the main debate stage since early in the race for the GOP nomination.\n\u201cTune in as we exclude Carly Fiorina, but include people she beat,\u201d begins the video."}
