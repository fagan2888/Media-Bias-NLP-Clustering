As a partner at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers (KPCB), she\u2019s helped develop companies that led to some pretty sizable exits, and we\u2019re thrilled to announce that Seidenberg will be talking with us about her journey, Silicon Valley and her take on medical biotech startups at Disrupt SF 2015.\n\nSince Seidenberg joined KPCB in 2005, she\u2019s incubated five companies and served as the founding CEO of two. Perhaps most notably, she navigated the exit of biotech company Flexus Biosciences, which was acquired by Bristol-Myers Squibb in February for $1.25 billion. Her other exits include Arresto Biosciences (acquired for $225 million), Atara Biotherapeutics (IPO in October 2014), Tesaro (IPO in 2012), and iPierian (acquired by Bristol-Myers Squibb in 2014 for $725 million).\n\nShe also serves on the board of 9 companies, including 3-V Biosciences, Armo Biosciences, Atara, Auxogyn, Breathe Technologies, Epizyme, iPierian, Redbrick Health and TESARO, all of which keeps her pretty busy while staying abreast of everything happening in the healthcare arena.\n\nNeedless to say, Dr. Seidenberg provides a valuable skill set to KPCB and we\u2019re lucky to have her speak at Disrupt SF.\n\nSeidenberg has a lot to say about the current state of the healthcare system, the tech industry\u2019s love \u2013 hate relationship with the Food and Drug Administration, and how the healthcare startup landscape is changing in light of President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act. And she\u2019s playing a central role in that change. At KPCB, Seidenberg focuses on life science, investing in digital health and biotech companies who drive to improve health and the treatment of patients.\n\nBefore KPCB, Seidenberg was senior vice president of development and chief medical officer of Amgen, Inc. Prior to that, she was a senior executive in research and development at Bristol-Myers Squibb as well as Merck & Co., Inc. She received her M.D. degree from the University of Miami, and did post-graduate training at Johns Hopkins University, George Washington University and the National Institutes of Health.\n\nCome hear what insights Seidenberg has to share at Disrupt SF 2015, which takes place September 21 \u2013 23 at San Francisco\u2019s historic Pier 70.
