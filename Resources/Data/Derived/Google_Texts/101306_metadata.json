Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., is going up against one of his closest friends in the U.S. Senate for the plum post of Budget Committee chairman \u2014 a matchup that could determine, in part, the policy agenda as Republicans take control of the upper chamber next month.\n\nSessions, the ranking minority member of the Budget Committee, was seen as the natural successor to head the Senate panel.\n\nHowever, the budget hawk \u2014 also a passionate opponent of amnesty for illegal immigrants \u2014 faces a challenge from Sen. Mike Enzi, R-Wyo. His friend is the more senior member, albeit by the luck of the draw.\n\nSessions, 67, and Enzi, 70, both were elected to the Senate in 1996. Because neither had been a member of the House of Representatives or a governor, they and other freshman senators lacking those credentials pulled names from a hat to determine seniority.\n\nEnzi fared better than Sessions and so officially ranks higher than his Alabama colleague on the Budget Committee. Because of his seniority, Enzi has standing to challenge Sessions.\n\nTwo years ago, Enzi chose not to assert his seniority on the committee, allowing Sessions to become Republicans\u2019 ranking member.\n\nNow, however, the Wyoming Republican is using that seniority to make a play for the chairmanship.\n\nCommittee members will vote on a new chairman in a secret ballot next month.\n\nDaniel Head, Enzi\u2019s press secretary, declined comment and directed The Daily Signal to a prepared statement that the senator issued last month. It reads:\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s overreach on immigration is one example of abuse of power. I have always opposed amnesty and will continue to. Unfortunately, it\u2019s not the only example. If we are going to replace Obamacare, reform our tax code and stop wasting money on programs that don\u2019t work, the Senate Budget Committee and Senate Finance Committee are going to play a major role.\n\n>>> Where John McCain Stands on Thwarting Obama\u2019s Amnesty\n\nSessions\u2019 office did not return multiple requests for comment from The Daily Signal.\n\nThe senators and their wives maintain close relationships, and both Republicans have remained relatively quiet about their contest for the chair.\n\nSome reports argue Sessions\u2019 outspoken opposition to President Obama\u2019s ideas for immigration reform is part of the reason his future as Budget Committee chairman is in jeopardy.\n\nObama last month took executive action and announced that he would allow up to 5 million illegal immigrants to remain in the United States and apply for work permits without fear of deportation. The president said his plan was not \u201camnesty,\u201d though many conservatives consider it that.\n\nSessions, who has opposed both legislative and executive amnesty for illegal immigrants, wasted no time in responding to Obama\u2019s remarks. In a speech at The Heritage Foundation the next day, the Alabama Republican said the president\u2019s move was an abuse of power that ultimately would hurt current citizens and those following the legal process to become citizens.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for us to stand up for the American worker,\u201d he said.\n\n>>> Conservatives Push Short-Term Funding to Block Obama on Illegal Immigrants\n\nSessions has used his perch as the top Republican on the Budget Committee to \u201cchange the dynamics\u201d of the debate over how to fix the immigration system.. He has explained the impact policies such as amnesty would have on everyday Americans, a former Republican Senate staffer told The Daily Signal.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not in a crisis of finding enough workers,\u201d Sessions said in his speech at Heritage. \u201cWe\u2019re in a crisis of a lack of jobs.\u201d\n\nThat outspokenness, though, could stall his ascent.\n\nGaston Mooney, executive director of the Conservative Review, a center-right organization that scores and ranks GOP lawmakers, said Enzi\u2019s attempt to beat Sessions and head the Budget Committee is a way for establishment Republicans to \u201cpunish\u201d conservatives:\n\nThese latest efforts to punish conservatives are designed to undermine the influence of those who intend to stand up to executive amnesty and President Obama. The latest target, Sen. Sessions, has done a superb job serving as the ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee, and he has made it clear he plans to stop Obama\u2019s executive amnesty. This illustrates the disconnect between establishment Republicans and the voters. Why bench your all-star for a walk on?\n\nThe former Senate staffer said the Budget Committee could become one of the most influential in the next Congress because the chairman \u2014 along with his counterpart on Finance \u2014 will be instrumental in setting the Senate\u2019s policy agenda on fiscal issues.\n\nAlthough Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, set to become majority leader next month, has not intervened in the race, the staffer said Enzi would be a boon to leadership. The former staffer said:\n\nIt\u2019s in their best interest to have their troops on the board in all of the key stops. Having your own guy chairing the Budget Committee is really important to stopping headaches for leadership.\n\nSince Sessions has advocated repealing Obamacare and pushed back on Democrats\u2019 support for amnesty, a loss for the Alabama Republican could signal the GOP\u2019s prevailing perspective in the Senate.\n\n\u201cIt shows that if Sessions doesn\u2019t get the Budget chairmanship, there\u2019s less support for him and his agenda, whether it\u2019s being fiscally responsible or on immigration,\u201d the former staffer said.\n\n>>> House Approves \u2018Purely Symbolic\u2019 Bill to Block Obama\u2019s Immigration Actions", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Jeff Sessions, Budget Committee, 114th Congress, MIke Enzi, Conservative Review, Gaston Mooney, Mitch McConnell, Heritage Foundation", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Sen.
