Nearly 100 members of the Pakistani-American Association of Connecticut held a vigil at the Connecticut State Capitol last Friday.\n\n\u201cTerrorism has no religion at all. It is un-Islamic and it is tragic. It was an act of desperation and an act of cowardly intentions,\u201d said Zaheer Sharaff, president of PAACT.\n\nMany students at the gathering held placards with messages such as \u201cEnough,\u201d \u201cProtect Our Children,\u201d and \u201cWe Demand an Anti-Terror Strategy.\u201d Their immigrant parents were deeply concerned for the safety of loved ones in Pakistan.\n\nMian Arshad of Waterbury lost a relative in the attack. \u201cHe was around 13 years old, and it was really devastating,\u201d Arshad said. \u201cAs a matter of fact, my whole family is there -- my mother; my brothers. All we can do is pray that everybody will be safe.\u201d\n\nThe community is rallying around to pitch in. Aleena Raza, a senior at Glastonbury High School, is organizing a fundraiser to help rebuild the Peshawar school. \u201cI can\u2019t believe that innocent, defenseless children were brutally massacred for nothing,\u201d she said, tearing up.\n\nAccording to Saud Anwar, Mayor of South Windsor, \u201cThere is a state of war within Islam. The victims of these extremists and terrorists -- the number one group of people they have murdered are Muslims. And it becomes critical for Muslims all over the world to unite against them.\u201d\n\nThe attack at the army-run school left 132 children dead. The Taliban claimed it retaliated the killing of its members by Pakistani authorities.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics", "description": "The Pakistani community in Connecticut strongly condemned the massacre of scores of school children by Taliban gunmen in Pakistan on December 16.
