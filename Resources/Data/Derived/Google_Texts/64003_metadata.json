At our house in the Maryland suburbs of Washington, D.C., we\u2019ve caught a bit of a break. Not because the temperatures haven\u2019t been below freezing \u2013 they certainly have, and for many days on end. But we\u2019ve been able to offset high heating bills somewhat because when we built our house in 1985, we designed it intentionally to save as much energy as possible, and to use the sun to supplement our furnace.\n\nBuying Our Home\n\nIt started with our decision to build a house in the first place. We knew where we wanted to live: in a city called Takoma Park, known for its participatory politics, collegial neighborhoods, and \u2013 most importantly to us \u2013 easy access to the subway stop that would soon be opening. Both my husband and I were working in downtown D.C., and being able to use mass transit to commute to work was a top priority. Climate change was already an issue we cared a lot about, and we wanted to do our part to reduce our carbon footprint at home too.\n\nFortunately for us, thirty years ago, land was still not only available, but affordable in the neighborhood where we eventually bought. We acquired a parcel full of trees about a block from the Metro and the design process got underway.\n\nTrees : Should They Stay or Should They Go?\n\nThe next big decision was what to do with all those trees! If we cut them down, we could put solar collectors on the roof and use the sun to heat hot water and generate electricity. But if we left them intact, the leaves would filter our air, shade our home in the hot summer, and still allow us some \u201csolar gain\u201d in winter when the leaves dropped. Plus, we loved a landscape full of trees and all the birds that flew onto their branches. So, rather than install an \u201cactive\u201d solar system with photovoltaic cells on our roof, we opted for a \u201cpassive\u201d system that would keep the trees and maximize energy efficiency and the amount of sunlight entering our home in the winter.\n\nTo take advantage of that sunlight, we sited our home so that it faced south, allowing it to capture solar energy as the sun moved from east to west throughout the day. We then put abundant windows on the house\u2019s south side to let as much sunlight in as possible. We were building in a historic district with a strongly Victorian character, so we couldn\u2019t actually put a greenhouse-type structure on the front, even though that would have captured the most sun. But with two sets of French doors, an atrium, a large picture window, and several smaller windows, we were still able to capture significant amounts of solar energy.\n\nSmart Energy Conservation Moves\n\nNo matter how much energy we\u2019d get from the sun, we knew it made sense to use as little energy as possible in the first place. To that end, we insulated the walls, attic and crawlspaces to the maximum \u201cR\u201d Value recommended by the U.S. Department of Energy. We also installed double-pane windows throughout. These days, triple-panes save the most energy. But in 1985, double-panes were the gold standard, and that\u2019s what we went with, covering them with energy-saving double-celled window shades to boot. We insulated exterior wall plugs, and added extra weather stripping to the entryway doors. We also installed storm doors to reduce additional loss of heated (or cooled) air.\n\nWhile we were at it, we put compact fluorescent light bulbs in pretty much every lighting fixture in the house. During the day, however, we found that we didn\u2019t need to use electric lights at all, given how much daylight all the windows let in!\n\nWe also bought highly energy-efficient appliances (which we\u2019ve since updated) and an energy-efficient heat pump and water heater, and signed up for our utility company\u2019s program to let them manage peak energy demand in the summer by cycling our air conditioning system on and off as needed.\n\nHow Much Energy Did We Actually Save?\n\nAfter the house was built, we asked our utility company to come out and do an energy audit for us. They determined that, as a result of the energy-conscious steps we took, our house was using about 73 percent less energy than other houses of about the same size!\n\nEven though that was almost thirty years ago, those efficiencies have held up. Today, no matter how cold it is outside, it never drops below 64 or 65 degrees inside the house during the day, and is regularly a toasty 70 degrees when the sun is shining. When we go to bed at night, even when the thermometer outdoors dips close to zero, I actually turn the heat off. The house cools down but generally never gets below 60 or 62 degrees. It heats back up quickly in the morning when we rise for school and work, and then when we come home at the end of the day.\n\nOur system helps in the summer, too. Our house is usually ten degrees cooler inside than it is outside, thanks to the shady, leafy canopy overhead and the insulation that prevents hot air from getting in and cooled air from getting out.\n\nSome day, I\u2019ll calculate how much money we\u2019ve actually saved on energy bills and how much climate changing carbon dioxide we haven\u2019t emitted thanks to the design and efficiency measures we\u2019ve taken. For now, I\u2019m working with Moms Clean Air Force to spread the word that energy efficiency really makes a difference! Even if you\u2019re not building a new house, you can improve the efficiency of your existing one significantly. Let us know if you do!\n\narticle by DIANE MACEACHERN\n\nPhotos: Diane MacEachern, Big Green Purse\n\nTELL EPA YOU SUPPORT NEW LIMITS ON CARBON POLLUTION\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://dingo.care2.com/pictures/greenliving/1304/1303075.large.jpg"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "34d24671362965e0c3942e7b3b484ea7"}, "fb": {"app_id": 83187307959}, "viewport": "width=device-width,user-scalable=no,initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd84af\"", "article_summary": "During the day, however, we found that we didn\u2019t need to use electric lights at all, given how much daylight all the windows let in!\nAnyone who\u2019s lived through this past harsh winter has learned the hard way what it costs to heat a home.\nTo take advantage of that sunlight, we sited our home so that it faced south, allowing it to capture solar energy as the sun moved from east to west throughout the day.\nBut with two sets of French doors, an atrium, a large picture window, and several smaller windows, we were still able to capture significant amounts of solar energy.\nFor now, I\u2019m working with Moms Clean Air Force to spread the word that energy efficiency really makes a difference!"}
