Two young cousins were struck by an SUV Saturday afternoon after getting ice cream from an ice cream truck.

It happened in the area of North 69th Avenue and Osborn Road in Phoenix.

The 8-year-old male and 7-year-old female had just bought ice cream from an ice cream truck and were crossing the street in front of the truck when they were hit.

Both children have been transported to Phoenix Children's Hospital in critical condition.

Police say the SUV was traveling at a moderate rate of speed. The driver remained at the scene.

The passenger in the SUV told us that they didnâ€™t know what happened; they thought they had hit a speed bump. He said both he and the driver are 19 years old.

Police say the driver is not facing any charges in this accident. But he was reportedly arrested at the scene on unrelated charges.

Family members tell us they are praying for the kids' recovery.
