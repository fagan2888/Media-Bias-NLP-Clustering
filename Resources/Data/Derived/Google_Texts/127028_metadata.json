First, it would delay to the law\u2019s reinsurance fee, a provision requiring employers to pay into a pool that would support insurers if too few healthy people obtained coverage through the exchanges. This fee is opposed by labor unions, so the move would be considered a plus for Democrats. Second, it would put in place a stricter procedure for verifying the income of people applying for government subsidies to buy insurance, which Republicans could claim as a win.\n\nBoth parties would get something out of the bill.\n\nFor Democrats, the date of the funding bill would give them a chance to renegotiate sequestration, which is set to kick in with another round of cuts on January 15. Under another term of the deal, agencies would also be granted more flexibility in implementing sequester cuts if they aren\u2019t replaced by a new budget deal.\n\nRepublicans could say they won at least some changes to the health care law and that they forced President Obama to play ball despite his refusal to negotiate under threat of shutdown and default. Democrats could say they stuck to Obama\u2019s pledge not to pay a \u201cransom\u201d for GOP votes, since they packaged two ACA provisions of corresponding value.\n\n\u201cFundamentally, we said we wanted a clean CR and a clean debt ceiling increase, and we got both,\u201d the senior Democratic aide told MSNBC. \u201cThe income verification/reinsurance trade is consistent with the principle that Rs don\u2019t get anything in exchange for the debt ceiling.\u201d\n\nBut no matter how you spin it, the Senate plan would represent a humiliating retreat for the conservative Republican lawmakers who refused to keep the government open unless Democrats either defunded or significantly disrupted the president\u2019s health care law. Monday\u2019s negotiations took place amid a flurry of polls showing the GOP at record lows in the public approval, a drop clearly attributable to the hardline strategy that produced the shutdown. That dynamic is likely to influence how each side views the deal.\n\nTexas Senator Ted Cruz, a leader of the \u201cdefund Obamacare\u201d effort, pointedly refused to discuss the emerging deal on Monday, telling reporters he wanted to \u201cwait to see what the details are\u201d in response to nine straight questions on the topic.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Senate leaders get down to business cutting a deal.", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/congress-goes-quiet-and-its-good-news", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "Senate leaders get down to business cutting a deal.", "title": "Congress goes quiet -- and it's good news", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/congress-goes-quiet-and-its-good-news", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/183653260.jpg?itok=g10WYeBQ", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/congress-goes-quiet-and-its-good-news", "image": {"width": 830, "identifier": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/183653260.jpg?itok=uemh4LMx", "height": 553}, "title": "Congress goes quiet -- and it's good news", "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Senate leaders get down to business cutting a deal."}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2013-10-14T21:47:33-04:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "nv": {"author": "fb-benjysarlin", "title": "Congress goes quiet -- and it's good news", "contentId": "http://tv.msnbc.com/2013/10/14/congress-goes-quiet-and-its-good-news/", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/congress-goes-quiet-and-its-good-news", "published": 1, "date": "10/14/2013 21:47:33 EDT"}, "article": {"author": "http://www.facebook.com/msnbc"}, "abstract": "Senate leaders get down to business cutting a deal.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "After weeks of partisan screeching over the shutdown and debt ceiling, things have gotten quiet in Congress \u2013 and that\u2019s a good sign.\n\u201c[We] had a good day yesterday, had a good day today,\u201d McConnell added.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made tremendous progress, but we\u2019re not there yet,\u201d Reid said in a brief floor speech before the Senate went home Monday night.\nDemocrats could say they stuck to Obama\u2019s pledge not to pay a \u201cransom\u201d for GOP votes, since they packaged two ACA provisions of corresponding value.\nDemocratic Majority Leader Harry Reid and Republican Minority Leader Mitch McConnell spent Monday huddled in private negotiations that both sides say have the potential to produce a deal."}
