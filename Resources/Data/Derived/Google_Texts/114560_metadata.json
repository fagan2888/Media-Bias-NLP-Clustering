Tour groups chatter in Chinese and Russian. The rumble of a jet arcing into the cloudless sky from Reagan National Airport dulls the conversation on the eve of Veterans Day.\n\nThe name is deeper.\n\nA swirl of wind sends leaves scratching along the path. The sweet smell of late fall mixes with cigarette smoke and wiped-away tears. There is a wreath from West Point\u2019s class of 1956. A map of the Ia Drang Valley. Red, white and blue poppies.\n\nOne middle-aged woman stretches upward to make a rubbing of a name.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s from a little town not even on the map,\u201d she says.\n\nA yellow-shirted volunteer reminds the woman to treat the rubbing with hairspray or cooking spray to avoid smears.\n\nGo further, until the wall towers over your head. The trees coated in deep red and yellow and pumpkin orange disappear. The sun is so bright that you can almost see your reflection against the names.\n\nA bunch of wilted red roses rest at the base of panel 8W. So does a white rose wrapped in plastic. Beads of condensation fill the inside. Thirty-eight rows down is James R. Kalsu.\n\nAmong the sea of names, among the stories, among the lives cut short is the lone active NFL player to die in Vietnam.\n\nStand on your toes and you can just run your fingers across the 11 letters of his name.\n\nMen in jean jackets with \u201cRolling Thunder\u201d emblazoned on the back walk past others wearing hats with the names of long-ago units.\n\nA mortar shell took Bob Kalsu\u2019s life on July 21, 1970, at FSB Ripcord in Thua Thien, Vietnam. The former All-America offensive lineman at the University of Oklahoma played 14 games for the Bills in 1968. A year later, he was in Vietnam with the 101st Airborne.\n\nBy the time the 23-day battle around the base ended, Kalsu was among 75 American dead. He lived 25 years.\n\nThe sacrifice is as real as the black granite another yellow-shirted volunteer polishes as visitors walk past.\n\nThis is a world away from the pseudo-military ethos that swarms through football today where nothing is more glorified, no compliment higher than a player as a warrior. Play through pain. Risk your health. Battle. Fight. Attack.\n\nWhere in a few days Northwestern University will wear Under Armour-designed uniforms against the University of Michigan that are \u201cinspired\u201d by a distressed American flag, but, instead, look as if blood splattered over the helmet, gloves and shoulders. When flags age, they don\u2019t look as if they\u2019ve been covered in blood. No, they fade. All this is supposed to support the Wounded Warrior Project. Supposed to honor veterans. Hyper-patriotic splatters.\n\nWhere well-intentioned special-edition adidas cleats autographed by Robert Griffin III to benefit the Operation Renewed Hope Foundation come with a dog tag and are packaged in a replica of an ammo can.\n\nWhere players tuck in camouflage towels the same way they tucked in pink ones last month to remind us about breast cancer.\n\nWhere salutes, instead of dance moves of questionable taste, celebrate touchdowns.\n\nWhere the NFL boasts an \u201cofficial military appreciation sponsor.\u201d\n\nThe message isn\u2019t subtle: This is much more than a mere game.\n\n\u201cOur cultures are similar in so many ways,\u201d NFL commissioner Roger Goodell told a group of West Point cadets last year.\n\nThe wall tells another story. Games end. They are a diversion, an escape. The wall swallows you.\n\nDown the way from Kalsu\u2019s name, a white-haired man in baggy black slacks and a windbreaker strains to start a rubbing.\n\n\u201cLet me get that for you, sir,\u201d a volunteer says.\n\n\u201cThis is my list,\u201d the man says, holding a palm-sized piece of paper covered with names. \u201cThis is all of us.\u201d\n\nTears start.\n\n\u201cI get all choked up,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t know why.\u201d\n\nThe man flicks open a knife to sharpen his pencil.\n\nThe volunteer pats his back. She tells him the tears are normal. They are good.\n\nNearby, a wrinkled piece of paper leans against the wall. The wind can\u2019t seem to move the scrap.\n\n\u201cIn the end,\u201d the paper says, \u201cthere is only the memory of the dead and the sound of old soldiers weeping.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A mortar shell took Bob Kalsu's life on July 21, 1970, at FSB Ripcord in Thua Thien, Vietnam.
