Advocates for the impending switch to ICD-10 medical classification codes, which would bring U.S. healthcare in line with international coding standards, have been swarming on Twitter, using the hashtag #ICD10Matters to build awareness and support for the changeover.

Viral hashtag campaigns aren’t new, but it’s not often you see groundswell campaigns about healthcare management topics.

Advocates for the impending switch to ICD-10 medical classification codes, which would bring U.S. healthcare in line with international coding standards, have been swarming on Twitter, using the hashtag #ICD10Matters to build awareness and support for the changeover. The movement, which is a few months old, recently flared up again to counter a campaign by the Texas branch of the American Medical Association asking members to lobby Congress to delay the deadline for ICD-10 compliance, currently set for Oct. 1, 2015.

The tweets, mostly backed by members of the American Health Information Management Association, highlight information about ICD-10, and why supporters feel the switchover is important to improve patient tracking and accurate billing. In some cases, advocates have shared detailed infographics about the ICD-10 impact, including its importance related to the Ebola outbreak. However, in some cases, posters have gotten far more creative, taking pages from the more trivial social memes found everyday online. Ryan Gosling and ICD-10? Believe it.
