(Nasdaq:BJRI) today announced that its Board of Directors approved a $100 million increase to the Company's share repurchase program first announced on April 22, 2014. The total authorized repurchase amount under the program is now $150 million. After giving effect to approximately $48 million in repurchases made since the plan was first authorized on April 22, 2014, approximately $102 million of repurchase authorization remains available on the newly expanded plan.\n\nThe Company also announced that it is working to finalize the expansion of its current unsecured revolving credit facility from $75 million to $150 million. The amendment and expansion of the credit facility is subject to final terms and customary documentation. As of this date, the Company has $25 million in funded borrowings under its current credit facility, and also has an additional $11.5 million of standby letters of credit outstanding under the facility that support the Company's insurance arrangements.\n\n\"Reflecting the continued progress on our strategic initiatives to reignite sales, coupled with our strong operating cash flow and solid balance sheet, we believe BJ's is well positioned to continue executing our restaurant expansion plan while simultaneously and opportunistically returning capital to shareholders,\" commented Greg Trojan, President and Chief Executive Officer. \"In addition, we are making steady progress with identifying and implementing certain productivity and cost-savings initiatives and remain focused on restoring our restaurant-level cash flow margins to at least 19% on a sustainable basis. Considering these factors, the Board and management believe an expansion of our existing authorization is a prudent use of capital and demonstrates our continued confidence in BJ's strategy.\"\n\nTrojan added, \"Importantly, we remain fully committed to our long-term growth strategy of increasing restaurant operating weeks by at least 10% annually. To date, in 2014 we have opened six new restaurants with plans to open five more restaurants by year-end. Our current restaurant development pipeline is in excellent shape and we expect to open at least 15 new restaurants in fiscal 2015. With only 151 restaurants open as of today, and with estimated room domestically for at least 425 BJ's restaurants, we have many years of solid expansion opportunities ahead.\"\n\nPursuant to the share repurchase authorization, purchases may be made from time to time through various methods in accordance with applicable securities laws, including open market transactions, block trades, accelerated share repurchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, certain of which may be effected pursuant to a trading plan adopted in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The timing and actual amount of shares to be purchased will be subject to management's evaluation of market conditions, applicable legal requirements, the Company's ongoing evaluation of its capital position and capital requirements and other factors. The Company is not obligated to purchase any additional shares under its expanded repurchase program, and repurchases may be suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice.\n\nBJ's Restaurants, Inc. currently owns and operates 151 casual dining restaurants under the BJ's Restaurant & Brewery\u00ae, BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse\u00ae, BJ's Pizza & Grill\u00ae and BJ's Grill\u00ae brand names.
