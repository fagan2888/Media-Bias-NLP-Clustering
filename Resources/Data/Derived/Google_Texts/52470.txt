Louisville, KY

41 South Dakota FFA members received the gold American Key Degree, the highest degree awarded by the organization. The award is given to about one and a half percent of the total national membership.

Receiving the degree is the final step in the system which promotes an agricultural career.

The students demonstrated leadership abilities and outstanding achievements in the agricultural business, production, processing and service programs.

Those who received the degree must have earned $7,500 through a supervised agricultural experience program and productively invested those earnings.

Those who received the degree were honored today at the National FFA Convention in Louisville, KY.
