The health insurer laid off about 30 workers from its health plan operations.\n\nThe reductions total about 0.5 percent of Highmark's 20,000 employees and were spread across offices in Pennsylvania, Delaware and West Virginia.\n\nMost laid-off employees will be given the chance to apply for other jobs at Highmark or with other companies working with HM Health Solutions, Seay said.\n\nHighmark's market share in Western Pennsylvania dropped to 60 percent in January, down from 63 percent a year earlier, the insurer reported this month. The decline was driven by a loss of 150,000 employer-group members who were concerned about keeping discounted access to UPMC's huge network of 20 hospitals and more than 3,500 doctors.\n\nIt lost Medicare Advantage members but gained individual subscribers through HealthCare.gov, the federal government's online marketplace for buying coverage under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nHighmark Inc. is the health insurance division of Highmark Health, which also owns the Allegheny Health Network system of hospitals and doctors.\n\nAlex Nixon is a staff writer for Trib Total Media.
