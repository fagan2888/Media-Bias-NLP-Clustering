That translates to nearly $71,000 per household, according to CNSNews.com, relying on U.S. Treasury and Census Bureau data.\n\nFederal debt held by the public has increased from 39.3 percent of GDP in 2008 to 73.6 percent, an \u201calready high level,\u201d CBO notes. CBO expects that to continue to rise to 75.6 percent this year (\u201chigher than it has been since the years immediately following World War II\u201d) and on up to 86 percent by 2026.\n\nAs we have warned many times, federal borrowing for our sizable debt places an unfair burden on future generations, crowds out private savings and suppresses economic growth and innovation. This will only be exacerbated once the Federal Reserve allows interest rates to rise from their historic and artificially low levels, thereby substantially increasing our debt service costs.\n\nPaying down debt may not be as sexy a presidential campaign issue as buying votes with a new spending program, but we need responsible adults who will tackle the issue, lest we wake up one day and discover that we are Greece.", "article_metadata": {"geo.placename": "Santa Ana", "geo.region": "US-CA", "content_section": "commentary", "description": "Opinion: CBO: Federal budget deficit, national debt to soar | debt, percent, federal, budget, cbo, trillion, spending, years, deficit, national", "geo.position": "33.745573;-117.867834", "og": {"site_name": "The Orange County Register", "description": "The omnibus budget deal and accompanying tax breaks for businesses and individuals that Congress agreed to in December will put a greater strain on the national debt, according to the Congressional Budget Office\u2019s latest budget and economic outlook for 2016-2026.", "title": "CBO: Federal budget deficit, national debt to soar", "url": "http://www.ocregister.com/articles/debt-702025-percent-federal.html", "image": "http://www.ocregister.com/images/ocregister_facebooksharer.png", "locale": "en-US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ocregister", "image": {"src": "http://www.ocregister.com/images/ocregister_facebooksharer.png"}, "description": "The omnibus budget deal and accompanying tax breaks for businesses and individuals that Congress agreed to in December will put a greater strain on the national debt, according to the Congressional Bu", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "CBO: Federal budget deficit, national debt to soar"}, "fb": {"app_id": 107698536003308}, "content_type": "article", "ICBM": "33.745573, -117.867834", "Keywords": "debt, percent, federal, budget, cbo, trillion, spending, years, deficit, national", "publication_date": "2016-01-29", "access-type": "paid", "section": "commentary", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "content_title": "CBO: Federal budget deficit, national debt to soar"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1c58\"", "article_summary": "Federal debt held by the public has increased from 39.3 percent of GDP in 2008 to 73.6 percent, an \u201calready high level,\u201d CBO notes.\nDuring the first seven years of President Barack Obama\u2019s tenure, the national debt has increased $8.3 trillion (78 percent), and stands at $19 trillion.\nThe omnibus budget deal and accompanying tax breaks for businesses and individuals that Congress agreed to in December will put a greater strain on the national debt, according to the Congressional Budget Office\u2019s latest budget and economic outlook for 2016-2026.\nThis will only be exacerbated once the Federal Reserve allows interest rates to rise from their historic and artificially low levels, thereby substantially increasing our debt service costs.\nAs we have warned many times, federal borrowing for our sizable debt places an unfair burden on future generations, crowds out private savings and suppresses economic growth and innovation."}
