In October 2015, DNC. chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., reportedly huddled with dozens of lobbyists to plan the convention in Philadelphia, and provided the influence peddlers involved with a menu of offerings in exchange for donations. In February, news reports revealed that the DNC. had quietly lifted the Obama-era ban on federal lobbyist donations to the party and convention committee.\n\nAnna Adams-Sarthou, the communications director for the Philadelphia 2016 Host Committee, wrote in an email to The Intercept that she has \u201cno concerns\u201d about lobbyists participating in the effort, because \u201cthe Host Committee is a nonprofit entity that does not lobby.\u201d\n\nThe Host Committee, however, is deeply involved in planning events for the delegates, fundraising, and handling media relations, among other responsibilities.\n\n\u201cOur Host Committee is made up a diverse group of civic leaders that have led efforts like this in the past, many of whom were integrally involved in the bid for Philadelphia to host the Convention,\u201d Adams-Sarthou wrote.\n\n\u2026\n\nDavid Cohen is the Special Advisor to the Host Committee, and serves as the Executive Vice President of Comcast, overseeing the company\u2019s lobbying and regulatory strategy. In addition to being a \u201cHillblazer\u201d \u2014 one of Hillary Clinton\u2019s bundlers who has raised $100,000 or more \u2014 Cohen has been a particularly bitter and duplicitous leading opponent of the rules regarding net neutrality, the principle that all Internet traffic must be treated equally. And despite hosting fundraisers for Clinton at his home last summer, Cohen has spent heavily to help elect a Republican Congress, including recent donations to the NRCC; Sen. Toomey; Sen. Scott; Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H.; as well as $33,400 to the NRSC, a committee for helping elect GOP members to the Senate.\n\nThe Philadelphia Host Committee chairman, former Gov. Ed Rendell, headed for Wall Street as soon as he left office, and has since represented a number of controversial special interests. In 2011, as New York was debating regulations on fracking, Rendell wrote a pro-fracking opinion column in the New York Daily News, while failing to disclose that he was a paid consultant at a private equity firm that had investments in the industry.\n\nThat same year, Rendell started providing paid speeches on behalf of the Mujahideen-e Khalq (MEK), a fringe Iranian exile group that was considered a terrorist organization by the State Department at the time (it was delisted in 2012).", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "comcast, democratic party, dnc, lee fang, obamacare, republican donors, zaid jilani", "og": {"site_name": "Truthdig", "description": "Lobbyists and corporate executives working to undermine Obamacare and net neutrality will welcome Democrats to the July convention.\n - 2016/05/11", "title": "Republican Donors and Anti-Obamacare Lobbyists to Host Democrats\u2019 Nominating Convention", "url": "http://www.truthdig.com/eartotheground/item/republican_donors_and_anti-obamacare_lobbyists_to_host_20160511", "image": {"width": 360, "identifier": "http://www.truthdig.com/images/eartothegrounduploads/4994523865_08b8f74378_b_copy.jpg", "height": 254}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Lobbyists and corporate executives working to undermine Obamacare and net neutrality will welcome Democrats to the July convention.", "creator": "@truthdig", "url": "http://www.truthdig.com/eartotheground/item/republican_donors_and_anti-obamacare_lobbyists_to_host_20160511/", "image": {"width": 360, "identifier": "http://www.truthdig.com/images/eartothegrounduploads/4994523865_08b8f74378_b_copy.jpg", "height": 254}, "title": "Republican Donors and Anti-Obamacare Lobbyists to Host Democrats\u2019 Nominating Convention | Truthdig: Drilling Beneath the Headlines", "site": "@truthdig"}, "fb": {"app_id": 319814091404244}, "keywords": "Truthdig, Republican Donors and Anti-Obamacare Lobbyists to Host Democrats\u2019 Nominating Convention, comcast, democratic party, dnc, lee fang, obamacare, republican donors, zaid jilani", "article": {"tag": "comcast, democratic party, dnc, lee fang, obamacare, republican donors, zaid jilani", "published_time": "2016-05-11T08:56:03-08:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-11T10:12:04-08:00"}, "description": "Lobbyists and corporate executives working to undermine Obamacare and net neutrality will welcome Democrats to the July convention.\n - 2016/05/11"}, "article_summary": "The Philadelphia Host Committee chairman, former Gov.\nhad quietly lifted the Obama-era ban on federal lobbyist donations to the party and convention committee.\n\u2026David Cohen is the Special Advisor to the Host Committee, and serves as the Executive Vice President of Comcast, overseeing the company\u2019s lobbying and regulatory strategy.\n\u201cOur Host Committee is made up a diverse group of civic leaders that have led efforts like this in the past, many of whom were integrally involved in the bid for Philadelphia to host the Convention,\u201d Adams-Sarthou wrote.\nchair Rep.
