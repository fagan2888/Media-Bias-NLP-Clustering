To be fair to Brooks, this has been a good business opportunity afforded by the \u201cDo as I say, not as I do\u201d public hypocrisy of the modern conservative movement and its 24/7 mouthpiece, Fox News.\n\nAn obvious example includes screaming ad nauseam about runaway deficits as the biggest threat to our nation in a craven effort to destroy the social safety net. Yet those deficit concerns suddenly vanish when old white men with itchy trigger fingers salivate over defense spending. Or how about the sanctity of life?\n\nNothing is more important than controlling a woman\u2019s right to choose, because morality. Yet once the babies are born, those takers are on their own, especially if they\u2019re brown. And the nearly 5,000 American soldiers who have died in Iraq, a conflict of choice predicated upon manufactured GOP intelligence? That\u2019s not a waste of human life at all. No moral peccadillo whatsoever.\n\nWe\u2019ve all become inured to the right\u2019s insincere pearl clutching over \u201ccontroversies\u201d such as Benghazi, Obamacare and more while the middle and lower classes continue to lose socioeconomic stability. It\u2019s hard to muster more than listlessness at the endless, disingenuous analysis of the moral failings of the suffering. Because if you\u2019re rich, successful and healthy, it\u2019s not because you\u2019ve benefitted from a scale tipped in your favor according to the GOP. Nope. If you rise to the top of economic pile, it can only be because you\u2019re more deserving. That\u2019s how they pretend the system works, and if something is repeated often enough, it becomes conventional platform wisdom.\n\nDavid Brooks never tires of trying to inculcate us unrestrained liberals with his party\u2019s morality dogma. But this week, in a column entitled The Campus Crusaders, he takes the blame game a step further, arguing that today\u2019s weak and infantilized college students result in idea-free academic zones. In a logical fallacy of impressive dimensions, the younger generation\u2019s growing fatigue with the same old conservative conversations translates into:\n\n\u201cThey are going after people for simply failing to show sufficient deference to and respect for the etiquette they hold dear. They sometimes conflate ideas with actions and regard controversial ideas as forms of violence.\u201d\n\nSo conservative is the new liberal among today\u2019s kids, is that right Brooks? Pupils intolerant of ignorance and backward-looking policies that make true opportunistic equality impossible are ethically bankrupt. And Brooks is qualified to make this judgment because he\u2019s a Professor at Yale, thus often in proximity to students.\n\nLet\u2019s call this what it really is \u2013 pretensions to osmotic cultural anthropology couched in culture war sour grapes. And while we\u2019re justifiably impugning Brooks\u2019 snarky brand of faux academia, let\u2019s also review some of the \u201csources\u201d the longtime columnist leverages in constructing his argument.\n\nThe Silencing: How the Left is Killing Free Speech, by Kirsten Powers\n\nOn the Regnery Publishing website, the book is summarized as evaluating \u201ca growing intolerance from the left side of the political spectrum [] threatening Americans\u2019 ability to freely express beliefs without fear of retaliation.\u201d You may be shocked (shocked!) to learn that Powers is a Fox New contributor.\n\nBrooks misappropriates the March 21, 2015 work of his Times colleague Judith Shulevitz to tie issue-based sensitivity around sexual assault and rape culture on college campuses to a liberal \u201cform of zealotry.\u201d\n\nBy linking to this website in a general way, rather than to a specific topic, Brooks appears to hope that readers will connect the site\u2019s mission to \u201cdefend and sustain individual rights at America\u2019s colleges and universities\u201d with a conservative agenda. Brooks takes the lazy route to serving up specific examples of imperiled free speech in academia, and fails completely to correlate the content with liberal moral infirmity.\n\nIn the meat and potatoes of his column, David Brooks writes of today\u2019s morally challenged student movement as one \u201cled by students forced to live with the legacy of sexism, with the threat, and sometimes the experience, of sexual assault. It is led by students whose lives have been marred by racism and bigotry. It is led by people who want to secure equal rights for gays, lesbians and other historically marginalized groups.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s a thought I\u2019d like to contribute to Brooks\u2019 \u201cidea-free\u201d liberal debate. If the majority of today\u2019s students refuse to create \u201csafe space\u201d for the continued subjugation of anyone not wealthy, white and male, perhaps the moral failing belongs to you and your fellow conservatives for expecting to be accommodated. Many a belief and notion throughout history has been popularly shunted aside, not from moral corruption, but rather a modern inability to serve rational, progressive society.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "america, conservatism, Conservatism in the United States, David Brooks, Republican Party, United States", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Becky Sarwate", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "In a post-9/11 world, self-styled \"moderate\" conservative and New York Times Op-Ed columnist David Brooks has carved out a cottage industry conflating morality with anti-liberal politics.
