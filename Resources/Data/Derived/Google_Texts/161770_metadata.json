Frank/Reuters)\n\n\u201cPresident Obama told the American people that under Obamacare the average family\u2019s premium would drop $2,500. In fact, the average family\u2019s premiums have risen $3,000. Now, Chris [Wallace], if you\u2019re a single mom, if you\u2019re struggling to feed your kids, $5,500, that is real money that you can\u2019t provide for your family.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), interview on Fox News Sunday, Jan. 31, 2016\n\nOh my, this tired old talking point again. A version of this claim was first made in the 2012 campaign. And yet it keeps popping up, presumably because it sounds like such a delicious talking point.\n\nBut four years later, it still isn\u2019t right. So, once again, here\u2019s why this is nonsense math.\n\nThe Facts\n\nThis story starts with a misleading claim made by then-Sen. Barack Obama, campaigning for the presidency in 2008 \u2014 which should be a lesson to today\u2019s would-be presidents about making false statements during a campaign.\n\nAt least 19 times during the 2008 campaign, according to a video circulated by GOP lawmakers, Obama claimed that his health-care plan would reduce \u201cpremiums by as much as $2,500 per family.\u201d\n\nThe specifics were laid out in an Obama campaign memo, which called the $2,500 figure a \u201cbest-guess\u201d assumption.\n\nBut Obama\u2019s pledge came with a very large asterisk: He was not saying premiums would fall by $2,500, but that health-care costs per family would be that much lower than anticipated. In other words, if overall costs \u2014 not just premiums \u2014 were expected to rise by $5,000 by 2012, they would only rise by $2,500. We should note that Obama was not especially clear about that aspect of the estimate \u2014 and as shown in the video, he frequently misstated it.\n\nWhen Obama made this claim in 2008, he was quickly called out by fact checkers. The Fact Checker awarded Obama Two Pinocchios for the pledge, saying that it was based on shaky assumptions (such as a Rand Corp. study that was criticized by the Congressional Budget Office). Moreover, there was no guarantee that any cost savings would be passed on to consumers; it could just be pocketed by insurance companies.\n\nBut apparently no one ever forgets these pledges.\n\nThe health-care plan that emerged from Congress was significantly different from Obama\u2019s campaign proposal. Yet the White House in 2011 offered a reestimate that the plan would yield $2,000 in savings by 2019. In 2014, Obama even began to claim that \u201cthe average premium for family coverage today would be $1,800 higher\u201d if not for his health-care plan \u2014 a statement that also yielded Pinocchios. (It is very difficult, even at this date, to determine how much a slowdown in health-care costs is attributable to the Affordable Care Act. The Great Recession resulted in a general slowdown in health-care costs around the globe.)\n\nOkay, we have stipulated that Obama started this with his bogus, asterisk-laden pledge. But then Cruz, as many other Republicans before him, compares that pledge to the growth in employer-based premiums, derived from a Kaiser Family Foundation survey.\n\nThe 2015 survey shows that the average annual premium for family coverage was $17,545 in 2015. Premiums thus have gone up $3,775 since 2010 \u2014 when the law was passed \u2014 or $1,800 since 2012, when the Affordable Care Act was fully implemented. Cruz says $3,000, which may have been an old talking point. (In 2013, the GOP claim was that premiums had gone up $3,000 since Obama took office.)\n\nBut a key point of the Kaiser report is that average premiums have risen at a remarkably low rate \u2014 4 percent in 2015 \u2014 in recent years. \u201cEven with these new requirements [from the Affordable Care Act], most market fundamentals have stayed consistent with prior trends, suggesting that the implementation [of the law] has not caused significant disruption for most market participants,\u201d the report said.\n\nStill, the report makes the case that while premium growth has slowed, the cost of deductibles has soared.\n\nFinally, Cruz then combines both the Obama \u201cpromise\u201d and the increase in premiums to suggest that a \u201csingle mom\u201d is struggling under a burden of $5,500 that the law has taken away from her \u2014 which is quite a non sequitur.\n\nThe Cruz campaign did not respond to queries.\n\nThe Pinocchio Test\n\nWe realize the temptation is great for Republicans to keep citing this ridiculous Obama promise \u2014 even though the pledge was imprecisely stated and called out by fact checkers at the time. Moreover, the law that emerged from Congress was different from the Obama campaign plan. Note that Cruz says \u201cPresident Obama told the American people.\u201d But in reality, it was not a pledge made during his presidency.\n\nBut it\u2019s doubly absurd to combine the old campaign pledge with increases in health-care premiums \u2014which overall have grown at historically low rates during Obama\u2019s presidency. Whether that is because of the law is certainly subject to debate, but creating an imaginary burden is not.\n\nThree Pinocchios\n\n\n\n\n\n(About our rating scale)\n\nVoting is closed on this poll User Poll Results: How would you rate Ted Cruz's claim about Obamacare? 20% 20% 20% 20% 20% Pardon the interruption!
