Medical officials were providing information that later turned out to be wrong. Guidance to local health teams was not adequate. It was unclear which Ebola patients belonged in which threat categories.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not tight,\u201d a visibly angry Mr. Obama said of the response, according to people briefed on the meeting. He told aides they needed to get ahead of events and demanded a more hands-on approach, particularly from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \u201cHe was not satisfied with the response,\u201d a senior official said.\n\nThe Times obviously doesn\u2019t know the difference between \u201cseething\u201d and \u201cimpotent rage.\u201d\n\nThis ongoing public relations effort by the Times and the rest of the media is as laughable as it is transparent. The Times wants us to believe everyone let Obama down so we forget how he serially lets the American people down, and does so with a toxic mix of indifference, incompetence, and arrogance.\n\nObama has been a sitting United States President for nearly six years. He is the most powerful man in the world, and the people at the CDC (and elsewhere) are the people he wants there.\n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget that the same media currently embarrassing itself with these stories is the same media that mercilessly attacked anyone as racist who questioned Obama\u2019s lack of experience and fitness to lead. On the shoulder of a cheering media, Obama entered the Oval Office with zero executive experience. And now we know after 6 years that he is incapable of learning on the job.\n\nThis \u201cseething\u201d meme is the media attempting to justify its own unforgivable mistake as much as Obama\u2019s.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC", "article_metadata": {"description": "New York Times: 'Seething' Obama Has Been Let Down by CDC", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "New York Times: 'Seething' Obama Has Been Let Down by CDC", "title": "New York Times: 'Seething' Obama Has Been Let Down by CDC - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2014/10/09/Obama-827png.png", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2014/10/18/new-york-times-seething-obama-let-down-by-cdc/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "New York Times: 'Seething' Obama Has Been Let Down by CDC", "title": "New York Times: 'Seething' Obama Has Been Let Down by CDC - Breitbart", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2014/10/09/Obama-827png.png", "creator": "@noltenc", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Mainstream Media, New York Times, Twitter,Big Journalism,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Journalism", "tag": "Twitter", "published_time": "2014-10-18T07:41:00-07:00", "categories": "Big Journalism"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddda9\"", "article_summary": "On the shoulder of a cheering media, Obama entered the Oval Office with zero executive experience.\nThe Times wants us to believe everyone let Obama down so we forget how he serially lets the American people down, and does so with a toxic mix of indifference, incompetence, and arrogance.\nThis \u201cseething\u201d meme is the media attempting to justify its own unforgivable mistake as much as Obama\u2019s.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not tight,\u201d a visibly angry Mr. Obama said of the response, according to people briefed on the meeting.\nThose frustrations spilled over when Mr. Obama convened his top aides in the Cabinet room after canceling his schedule on Wednesday."}
