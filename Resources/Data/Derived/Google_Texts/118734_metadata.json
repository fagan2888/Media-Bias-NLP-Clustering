Has anyone here woken up to the fact that we are always the last ones to be considered in the equation of change?\"Yet there were doctors who said they wanted to see a single-payer system.\"We need a single-payer system that provides better coordination of care, reduces overhead and management costs, reduces complexity of reimbursements, provides a single formulary,\" one doctor argued.\"We also need federal tort reform to reduce the cost of medicine.\"Still another doctor scolded:\"Trust doctors to do the job we are trained to do. Stop treating our profession as if we are all ex-cons who need constant monitoring lest we commit fraud or some other crime.\"", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "doctors, Obamacare, failing, grades", "pubdate": "2014-09-17T20:09:56", "og": {"site_name": "Newsmax", "description": "Demoralized U.S. doctors who are down on Obamacare, and on an increasingly burdensome bureaucracy, are giving the president's signature healthcare law mostly failing grades, says a new survey released Wednesday.", "title": "Poll: Almost Half of Doctors Give Obamacare 'D' or 'F' Grade", "url": "http://www.newsmax.com/US/doctors-Obamacare-failing-grades/2014/09/17/id/595323/", "type": "article", "image": "http://www.newsmax.com/App_Themes/Newsmax/images/facebook/newsmaxFBLogo.gif", "page_id": 85452072376}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.newsmax.com/US/doctors-Obamacare-failing-grades/2014/09/17/id/595323/", "title": "Poll: Almost Half of Doctors Give Obamacare 'D' or 'F' Grade", "description": "Demoralized U.S. doctors who are down on Obamacare, and on an increasingly burdensome bureaucracy, are giving the president's signature healthcare law mostly failing grades, says a new survey released Wednesday.", "site": "Newsmax"}, "fb": {"admins": 100002083767056, "app_id": 323020797885219}, "msvalidate.01": "FAF1322EC761685A5DD9344A1C19E82A", "epoch": 1410984596, "google-site-verification": "Jt2HUKgzJJw9VwIQJv31ETytuvNNm5ypTWN6j0nYvHM", "keywords": "doctors, Obamacare, failing, grades", "article": {"section": "US", "published_time": "2014-09-17T20:09:56"}, "original-source": "http://www.newsmax.com/US/doctors-Obamacare-failing-grades/2014/09/17/id/595323/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "description": "Demoralized U.S. doctors who are down on Obamacare, and on an increasingly burdensome bureaucracy, are giving the president's signature healthcare law mostly failing grades, says a new survey released Wednesday."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd376d\"", "article_summary": "\"Get government OUT of healthcare,\" one doctor wrote in an anonymous comment, the Washington Examiner noted.Another wrote, \"Repeal Obamacare.\n\"Thirty-nine percent of the doctors surveyed said they're planning to fast-track retirement plans because of changes in the healthcare system.\n\"\"I'm a Canadian physician practicing in the United States,\" yet another doctor wrote.\n\"Still another doctor scolded:\"Trust doctors to do the job we are trained to do.\n\"Yet there were doctors who said they wanted to see a single-payer system."}
