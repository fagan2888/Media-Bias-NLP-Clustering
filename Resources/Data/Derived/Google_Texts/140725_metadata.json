We don't yet have a complete strategy because it requires commitments on the part of the Iraqis as well: about how the improvement takes place, how that training takes place. And so, the details of that are not yet worked out.\n\nBerman then stated: \u201cI want to talk more about this\u201d because \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s more notable -- that the U.S. doesn\u2019t have a strategy, or a complete strategy, to train Iraqi forces to battle ISIS in Iraq or that the president used those words again -- \u2018no complete strategy\u2019 -- because this is something he was roundly criticized for\u201d last year.\n\n\u201cWe are all these months later, and there\u2019s still no strategy?\u201d he asked.\n\nGuest Fareed Zakaria, the host of CNN's flagship foreign affairs program, had a quick response. \u201cI think that the problem is this: We think of this as a technocratic problem. Why can't we train these troops faster? Why can't we get them more arms? Why can't we, you know, ramp up the readiness?\u201d\n\nInstead, \u201cthe problem is political,\u201d Zakaria noted. \u201cThe Iraqi army represents a government that is seen as a Shiite government by the Sunnis. Remember, the Sunnis are the guys that ISIS draws its recruits from.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo if you don\u2019t change the composition of the army, if you don\u2019t \u2026 make concessions to the Sunnis, bring them into the government, then you\u2019re building up what is going to be seen by the Sunnis as a Shiite army,\u201d the host of Fareed Zakaria GPS asserted.\n\n\u201cThe fact that you\u2019re training them and equipping them, all great,\u201d Zakaria stated. \u201cBut when they go in there, the Sunnis are going to say \u2018We prefer ISIS to this,\u2019 and that\u2019s what\u2019s been happening for the last year or two.\u201d\n\nBolduan joined the discussion by defending Obama:\n\nRight away, I\u2019m sure president Obama even knew himself that if he -- whatever -- what he was trying to say, he did not say it correctly. By saying \u2018We do not have a complete strategy,\u2019 he is really opening himself up to criticism, especially when you see, in light of the continued gains by ISIS, and the president continuing to say that we have temporary setbacks, but we will be ultimately successful. How, if you at this point, this far in, don\u2019t have a complete strategy?\u201d\n\nZakaria then stated that the U.S. government has to be careful not to criticize the Iraqis too much.\n\n\u201cRemember that Ash Carter, when he was the secretary of defense, when asked why Ramadi fell, he said: 'Well, let's face it. The Iraqi army -- which vastly outnumbered ISIS -- just didn't have the will to fight.'\u201d\n\nAgain stressing the political aspect of the situation, Zakaria noted: \u201cYou have an army that is not seen as representative of the whole country. The Sunnis don't want to fight with it. Probably, many of them want to fight against it.\u201d\n\nBerman concluded the segment by noting: \u201cThe president did say, in fact, there's more capacity to train Iraqi troops right now than are actually being taken advantage of by the Iraqis themselves.\u201d\n\nAs NewsBusters previously reported, Obama said that \u201cwe don't have a strategy yet\u201d during a news conference in late August.\n\nDuring the following day's edition of MSNBC's Morning Joe program, co-host Joe Scarborough defended the president's comment as a strategy that \u201cwhen you were weak, you make your enemies think you were strong. When you were strong, you make your enemies think you were weak.\u201d\n\nAlso leaping to Obama's defense was Josh Gerstein of the Politico website, who claimed that \u201cWe don\u2019t have a strategy yet\u201d was just an \"awkward choice of words\" and an \"inartful phrase.\"\n\nSoon after, NBC chief foreign correspondent Richard Engel ripped into the concept that Obama has no strategy to combat ISIS terrorists, calling that notion \u201cquite ridiculous.\"\n\nSomeone apparently forgot to tell Berman and Bolduan that the \u201cno strategy yet\u201d comment was merely an \u201cinartful phrase\u201d and \u201cquite ridiculous.\u201d We can only guess what Obama's defenders would say if a Republican president did the same thing.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "NewsBusters", "description": "During Monday's edition of the Cable News Network program At This Hour With Berman and Bolduan, anchors John Berman and Kate Bolduan played a clip of Barack Obama admitting that he still has no complete strategy to defeat ISIS, the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria.
