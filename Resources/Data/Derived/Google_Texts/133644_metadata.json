But Pittsburgh fell to Baltimore on Saturday night, setting up a preferred scenario for Denver.\n\nLed by Manning, the Broncos defeated the Colts, 31-24, in their season-opener at Sports Authority Field in September. The Broncos\u2019 quarterback threw a trio of first-half touchdown passes, all to Julius Thomas, and staved off a late rally by Luck and the Colts to preserve the victory.\n\nPretty? No. A blueprint for their playoff matchup? Definitely not.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the same Broncos team that opened the season. This isn\u2019t the same Manning-led offense that so many have become accustomed to seeing.\n\nIn his first two seasons in Denver, the passing game accounted for nearly 75 percent of the Broncos\u2019 total offense and 77.7 percent of their touchdowns. But since November, the Broncos have relied heavily on their their running game, thanks to C.J. Anderson.\n\nDenver compiled 753 rushing yards (3.66 per game) in its first seven games of the season; it racked up 1,032 (4.35) in its final eight. Anderson, the AFC player of the week in the final week of the regular season, ranked No. 10 among NFL rushers in yards per attempt (4.7) and tied for No. 8 in rushing touchdowns (eight).\n\nMeanwhile, Manning \u2014 who at this point last year had just capped a historic season with 5,477 passing yards and 55 touchdowns \u2014 has slowed a bit this season (4,727 yards, 39 touchdowns). In the Broncos\u2019 penultimate regular-season game, against the Bengals in Cincinnati, Manning threw four interceptions, the last of which was returned for a touchdown to seal the Bengals\u2019 victory.\n\nBut while much has been made of the Broncos\u2019 shifts on offense, a lot can be said about its changes on defense. The shaky defense the Colts saw in Week 1 blossomed into the league\u2019s third-best defense in net yards allowed per game (305.2) and second-best against the run (79.8 per game), a stark improvement over last season\u2019s No. 19 ranking in total defense.\n\nAnd with a vintage Von Miller lining up alongside DeMarcus Ware, the Broncos boast a sack duo that together totaled 24 sacks (14 from Miller, 10 from Ware), short of their preseason goal of 32, but enough to rank them both among the NFL\u2019s top 15.\n\nTheir jobs won\u2019t be easy Sunday. Luck ranks No. 3 in total passing yards (4.761), behind veterans Drew Brees and Ben Roethlisberger. Per Pro Football Focus, Luck graded out as the ninth-best starting QB on the season,one place above Manning.\n\nA lot has changed for the Broncos. And Manning. And the Colts. But Sunday\u2019s playoff game will, again, be a must-see.\n\nNicki Jhabvala: njhabvala@denverpost.com or a twitter.com/nickijhabvala", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Next up for Broncos: Peyton Manning\u2019s former team", "title": "Next up for Broncos: Peyton Manning\u2019s former team", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/01/04/next-up-for-broncos-peyton-mannings-former-team/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150104__colts-broncosp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150104__colts-broncosp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-04T14:14:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T05:06:45+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddcca\"", "article_summary": "Twenty-seven completions in 33 attempts, 458 passing yards, four passing touchdowns, one rushing touchdown and a 145.7 rating.\n3 in total passing yards (4.761), behind veterans Drew Brees and Ben Roethlisberger.\nBut Sunday\u2019s playoff game will, again, be a must-see.\nIn his first two seasons in Denver, the passing game accounted for nearly 75 percent of the Broncos\u2019 total offense and 77.7 percent of their touchdowns.\nLed by Manning, the Broncos defeated the Colts, 31-24, in their season-opener at Sports Authority Field in September."}
