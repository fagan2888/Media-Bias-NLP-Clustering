Panama reduced the size of ships allowed through the Panama Canal. Low water-levels have threatened hydroelectric power generation across the region. El Salvador and the Dominican Republic are experiencing periodic blackouts.\n\nThe regions\u2019 dry conditions from May through September appear to have damaged roughly half of the corn and a significant amount of the bean harvests. The prices of basic food staples rose 40 percent in some areas in 2014.\n\nPoor climate conditions and high prices have left hundreds of thousands of families across the region without access to basic food necessities. Many subsistence farmers in Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, do not have the money to buy food. The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization estimated that nearly 1 million people in Guatemala do not have sufficient food. The longer the drought lasts, the greater the humanitarian disaster will become.\n\nThe northern migration may already have begun.\n\nIn 2014, President Barack Obama let roughly 130,000 Central Americans into the United States. Despite tougher security by Mexican police, another 25,000 have since been let through the U.S. border by Obama\u2019s lax border policies.\n\nIn late 2014 and early 2015, despite strong pressure from voters, GOP leaders in Congress made only a half-hearted effort to tighten Obama\u2019s lax enforcement of migration rules. The lax enforcement rules are backed by the GOP\u2019s business donors, which gains extra customers and lower-wage workers.\n\nFederal data on illegal migration is vague and months behind current events. But the D.C.-based Center for Immigration Studies estimates the population of foreign migrants in the United States grew by 790,000 since the beginning of 2014. That inflow is up sharply from the prior annual inflow of roughly 350,000 migrants per year.\n\nDuring 2014, migrants from Central America overtook Mexico as the largest contributor of U.S. border apprehensions.\n\nBecause of El Ni\u00f1o, sea surface temperature \u201cwere near or greater than +2.0oC across the eastern half of the tropical Pacific\u201d in August 2015, according to the NWS. Large subsurface temperature anomalies persisted in the central and east-central equatorial Pacific with the largest exceeding 6oC. The normal wind pattern was interrupted by \u201cenhanced convection over the central and eastern equatorial Pacific that could cause a full reversal of the weather pattern and torrential rains to the West Coast. All models predict El Ni\u00f1o gaining strength.\n\nThe weather pattern shift has already started a drought in Central America and the Caribbean that are impacting Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Hispaniola and Cuba according to Stratfor Global Intelligence. Agricultural output is shriveling at a time when the area is still suffering from \u201ca recent outbreak of coffee rust.\u201d The scale of the drought in Central America has also led to higher homicide rates and drug-related violence.\n\nDuring the 1997 and 1998 El Nino, fires that raged through Central America as the vegetation dried up. The smoke impacted the U.S. as far north as Oklahoma.\n\nThree years later, the shortages of basic grains and vegetables were the worst since similar conditions 1,000 years ago led to the collapse of the 20 million population of the Mayan civilization that inhabited Guatemala, Belize and southern Mexico. Archeological evidence reveals massive deforestation during the period.\n\nThe dry season for Central America and the Caribbean runs from January through August.\n\nEl Nino will bring a better economic recovery to the U.S. West Coast over the next two years, but will increasingly devastate Central Americans. Facing starvation, millions of impoverished peasants may soon be headed for the United States.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Growing El Ni\u00f1o May Launch Huge Latino Migration to U.S.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Growing El Ni\u00f1o May Launch Huge Latino Migration to U.S.", "title": "Growing El Ni\u00f1o May Launch Huge Latino Migration to U.S.", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/09/El-Nino.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2015-09-12T13:20:52-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/09/12/growing-el-nino-may-launch-huge-latino-migration-to-u-s/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Growing El Ni\u00f1o May Launch Huge Latino Migration to U.S.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/09/El-Nino.jpg", "title": "Growing El Ni\u00f1o May Launch Huge Latino Migration to U.S.", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Central American immigration, El Ni\u00f1o, immigration tsunami,2016 Presidential Race, Big Government, Breitbart California,Migration", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-09-12T12:18:31-07:00", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "modified_time": "2015-09-12T13:20:52-07:00", "tag": "immigration tsunami", "categories": "Big Government,Breitbart California,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0ea7\"", "article_summary": "All models predict El Ni\u00f1o gaining strength.\nThe dry season for Central America and the Caribbean runs from January through August.\nDuring the 1997 and 1998 El Nino, fires that raged through Central America as the vegetation dried up.\nDuring 2014, migrants from Central America overtook Mexico as the largest contributor of U.S. border apprehensions.\nBecause of El Ni\u00f1o, sea surface temperature \u201cwere near or greater than +2.0oC across the eastern half of the tropical Pacific\u201d in August 2015, according to the NWS."}
