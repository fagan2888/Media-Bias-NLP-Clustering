Annual price growth is far more likely to remain below 2% over the next half decade than above it, Kocherlakota said.\n\n\"We need to do better,\" the central banker said, of the Fed's fight to heat up economic growth and inflation.\n\nKocherlakota is firmly in the camp of Fed chair Janet Yellen, who has strongly advocated maintaining economic stimulus for as long as needed to ensure the economy can hold its own before completely phasing out the easy-money policies.\n\nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT\n\nKocherlakota did not offer a forecast in his prepared remarks as to when he believes interest rates should be raised from their current near-zero level.\n\nLacker, a long-time vocal inflation hawk, cautioned in a speech that the Fed needs to be vigilant toward inflation.\n\n\u201cInflation, meanwhile, remains well-behaved, but maintaining that good performance will require withdrawing monetary stimulus at an appropriate time to prevent the emergence of inflationary pressures,\u201d Lacker said.\n\nWhile raising the notion of higher rates, Lacker also gave no timetable for when rates might move higher.\n\nKocherlakota and Lacker also offered differing views on U.S. labor markets. The U.S. added 288,000 jobs in June and the unemployment rate now stands at 6.1%, a six-year low.\n\nYet Kocherlakota reiterated the doves\u2019 position that labor markets aren\u2019t as strong as the monthly numbers suggest: \u201cThe good news is that the labor market has improved since the end of the Great Recession. The bad news is that the rate of improvement over the past four-plus years has been painfully slow,\u201d he said.\n\nLacker said there\u2019s less \u201cslack\u201d in labor markets than has been suggested by doves.\n\nInflation doves have advocated keeping interest rates low for the foreseeable future to stimulate the economy because \u201cslack\u201d in labor markets has prevented millions of Americans from finding well-paying, full-time jobs.\n\nHawks believe keeping rates too low for too long will push prices higher and lead to runaway inflation.", "article_metadata":
