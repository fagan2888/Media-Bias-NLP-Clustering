So if the Obama administration ultimately loses \u2014 and the federal payments that reduce consumers\u2019 outlays are blocked \u2014 it would be a major financial challenge to insurers. \u2026 Some insurers such as UnitedHealthGroup Inc. have already said they are withdrawing from the exchange marketplace because of financial losses, and that trend would likely accelerate if the decision stands.\u201d\n\nUndoubtedly, the decision will ultimately be settled in the Supreme Court, where Antonin Scalia\u2019s chair remains empty. It\u2019s pivotal Mr. Trump wins the White House so he can make a conservative pick to uphold this ruling, not to mention the other vacancies on the high court that may come up in four years.\n\nFor not only is the executive branch up for grabs this election cycle \u2014 so are the powers of the legislative branch. If Federal Judge Rosemary Collyer\u2019s decision is overturned, then the president\u2019s powers and policies won\u2019t be bound by the purse strings of Congress \u2014 which was our Founding Fathers\u2019 intention.\n\nThose who don\u2019t trust Mr. Trump\u2019s conservative values on all policy issues surely see what\u2019s at stake here \u2014 the upholding of our Constitutional values. Although some may question the quality of the judges he recommends, one thing is certain: They\u2019ll be better than if Hillary Clinton were choosing.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Donald Trump is the Republican Party's only hope for dismantling Obamacare.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Donald Trump is the Republican Party\u2019s only hope for dismantling Obamacare.", "title": "The only way to get rid of Obamacare is to vote for Donald Trump", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/may/13/only-way-get-rid-obamacare-vote-donald-trump/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/05/13/GOP_2016_Trump.JPEG-0454d.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/05/13/GOP_2016_Trump.JPEG-0454d.jpg", "description": "Donald Trump is the Republican Party's only hope for dismantling Obamacare.", "card": "summary", "title": "The only way to get rid of Obamacare is to vote for Donald Trump"}, "Author": "Kelly Riddell", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Donald Trump"}, "article_summary": "ANALYSIS/OPINION:Donald Trump is the Republican Party\u2019s only hope for dismantling Obamacare.\nSo if the Obama administration ultimately loses \u2014 and the federal payments that reduce consumers\u2019 outlays are blocked \u2014 it would be a major financial challenge to insurers.\nFor not only is the executive branch up for grabs this election cycle \u2014 so are the powers of the legislative branch.\nThose who don\u2019t trust Mr. Trump\u2019s conservative values on all policy issues surely see what\u2019s at stake here \u2014 the upholding of our Constitutional values.\nAlthough some may question the quality of the judges he recommends, one thing is certain: They\u2019ll be better than if Hillary Clinton were choosing."}
