There is little doubt that it was President Obama and his administration\u2019s failures that condemned the Democrats to a crushing defeat in both the congressional and gubernatorial contests last week. In particular, the president\u2019s fumbling foreign policy played a key part, in defiance of former House Speaker Tip O\u2019Neill\u2019s rule that \u201call politics is local.\u201d\n\nIn a New York Times/CBS poll conducted in September, 58 percent of voters expressed disapproval of Obama\u2019s foreign policy. The previous month, a majority said they thought the president was \u201cnot tough enough\u201d abroad. And an October Pew poll showed the Republicans doubling their lead over the Democrats on foreign policy compared with 2010.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter a period of Iraq-induced \u201cwar weariness,\u2019\u2019 the public mood has changed. Clearly, recent events in the Middle East \u2014 including the rise of ISIS and its hideous decapitations of two American citizens \u2014 have disabused voters of the fantasy that the United States could somehow walk away from the problems of that region with impunity.\n\nWatching disaster unfold in Syria and Iraq, as well as Ukraine, people have woken up to the fact that this president is, as Foreign Policy\u2019s David Rothkopf has written, a man whose \u201cpolitical and policy narcissism\u201d is \u201cbad for America and its role in the world.\u201d\n\nRELATED | Editorial: What the GOP victory means for Obama\u2019s foreign policy\n\nIn their 2012 presidential debate on foreign policy, Obama mocked then-rival Mitt Romney with the carefully crafted line: \u201cThe 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back.\u201d Who would not now welcome a return to the foreign policy of the 1980s? The 25th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall on Sunday was a reminder of just how successful it was.\n\n\u201cWhere Did Obama Go Wrong?\u201d asked the Washington Post\u2019s Juliet Eilperin and David Nakamura ahead of the midterms. Their answer was a litany of second-term failures at home as well as abroad. Gee, who could possibly have predicted that?\n\nWell, in August 2012 I wrote an article for Newsweek arguing against giving Obama a second term. It brought the wrath of the blogosphere down upon my head. Paul Krugman accused me of \u201cmultiple errors and misrepresentations,\u201d though he specified only one. James Fallows of the Atlantic pompously apologized on behalf of Harvard alumni. His colleague Matthew O\u2019Brien claimed to have found as many as a dozen factual errors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere was indeed one error in the piece: I was wrong to suggest that the Affordable Care Act would add to the deficit. But the other alleged errors were, on close inspection, differences of opinion at best. In any case, my argument wasn\u2019t about the mediocre performance of the US economy, which \u2014 as I said \u2014 could hardly all be blamed on the president. It was about the president\u2019s style of leadership.\n\nThe reason the public has lost its illusions about Obama is that he has proved to be as bumbling an executive as he was beguiling as a campaigner.\n\nThe president gave Congress a more or less free hand to design his flagship legislation \u2014 the stimulus, health care reform, financial regulation. The results were three giant messes. Worse, he has consistently failed to think through the implications of three major challenges to American power: the continuing spread of Islamic extremism, the military threat posed by an aggressive Russia, and the rise of Asia\u2019s new economic superpower, China.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a strategy yet,\u201d the president told reporters Sept. 4. He was referring to the specific challenge posed by ISIS. But those words pretty much sum up his foreign policy since 2009.\n\nRELATED | Opinion: Words matter in \u2018ISIS\u2019 war, so use \u2018Daesh\u2019\n\nThe perfect illustration is the president\u2019s 180-degree turn on Iraq. Elected as the man who could get the United States out of George W. Bush\u2019s war, he withdrew US forces far too hurriedly and \u2014 as predicted \u2014 has now been forced to send them back in to try to quell the resulting maelstrom.\n\nToday, of all days, this strategic ineptitude really rankles. Try telling the families of the brave servicemen and women who died serving their country over the past 11 years that America\u2019s new foreign policy doctrine is \u201cDon\u2019t do stupid sh**.\u2019\u2019\n\n(Oh, and for the record: I was just as critical of George W. Bush at the same stage in his presidency. Criticizing Obama\u2019s foreign policy doesn\u2019t equate to defending Bush\u2019s.)\n\nThe president\u2019s fumbling foreign policy played a key part in the Democrats\u2019 defeat.\n\nOf course, I don\u2019t expect my critics to admit I was right, much less to apologize. Last month, writing in Rolling Stone, Krugman insisted that Obama is \u201cone of the most consequential and, yes, successful presidents in American history.\u201d Fact-check this: \u201cMost analyses [of the midterms] suggest that control of the Senate is in doubt, with Democrats doing considerably better than they were supposed to. This isn\u2019t what you\u2019d expect to see if a failing president were dragging his party down.\u201d\n\nEr, no. Tuesday\u2019s thrashing of the Dems was exactly \u201cwhat you\u2019d expect to see if a failing president were dragging his party down.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "4.0.262212662", "eomportal-id": 870316, "description": "Sometimes politics isn\u2019t all local.
