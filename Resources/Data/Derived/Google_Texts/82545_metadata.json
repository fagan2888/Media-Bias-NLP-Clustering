Gazzaley and other brain experts said bigger studies were needed to assess whether the game could actually help people function in their everyday lives. He\u2019s co-founder of a company that aims to develop a product from the research.\n\nSpecialized video games might one day be able to boost mental abilities not only for healthy adults of middle age or older, but also children with attention deficit disorder, people with post-traumatic stress disorder or brain injury and older adults with depression or dementia, he said in an interview.\n\nThe work is the latest indication that people can help preserve their brainpower as they age through mental activity. There are \u201cbrain training\u201d games on the market and books devoted to the topic. Gazzaley stressed that claims should be backed up by evidence, and also that his results don\u2019t mean any commercial video game can help mental performance. His game was designed to exercise specific abilities, he said.\n\nThe game, called NeuroRacer, involves doing two things simultaneously. A player uses a joystick to guide a car along a hilly, twisting road, steering it and controlling its speed. At the same time, a series of signs \u2014 actually colored shapes \u2014 appears on the screen. The player is supposed to push a button only when a particular kind of sign appears. Players were scored on how quickly and accurately they reacted to the right signs.\n\nThe game progresses to harder levels as a player improves, to keep it challenging.\n\n\u201cYou really had to focus,\u201d said one study participant, Ann Linsley, 65, of Berkeley, Calif. \u201cI went through 22 levels. By the end, we were really cooking along.\u201d\n\nIn a separate experiment with 174 volunteers between the ages of 20 and 79, the researchers found that as people age, driving the car interferes more and more with performance on reacting to the signs.\n\nBut for 14 of the 16 participants who played the game at home for a total of 12 hours over a month, the training decreased the amount of interference. In fact, on this measure they did better than a group of 20-year-olds who played the game for the first time.\n\nThe improvements were still apparent six months after the training stopped.\n\nResearchers also found changes in brain wave activity that correlated with how well the improvement persisted at six months, as well as performance on a test of sustained attention for a boring task.\n\nBrain experts unconnected with the study said previous research has shown that older people can improve on mental skills such as multitasking if they are trained. But the training in past multitasking studies was \u201cboring as all get-go,\u201d said Elizabeth Zelinski, a professor of gerontology and psychology at the University of Southern California. Presenting an appealing game like NeuroRacer instead could help people stick with it, she said.\n\nLinsley certainly enjoyed the game. \u201cI looked forward to doing it,\u201d she said. When she had to give the laptop with the game back to the researchers, \u201cI kind of missed it.\u201d\n\nArt Kramer, a neuroscientist at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, called the work a promising first step toward a possible therapy. Scientists still have to demonstrate the results will hold up with larger groups of test subjects, he said.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Video game helps elderly stay sharp", "title": "Video game helps elderly stay sharp", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/09/05/video-game-helps-elderly-stay-sharp/", "image": {"width": 1000, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130906__7182730b-eb46-4a42-855f-e221ee111a3bp1.jpg", "height": 667}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130906__7182730b-eb46-4a42-855f-e221ee111a3bp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-06T04:59:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-29T11:38:39+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde8bd\"", "article_summary": "Gazzaley stressed that claims should be backed up by evidence, and also that his results don\u2019t mean any commercial video game can help mental performance.\nIt probably won\u2019t become as popular as \u201cGrand Theft Auto,\u201d but a specialized video game may help older people boost mental skills like handling multiple tasks at once.\nThere are \u201cbrain training\u201d games on the market and books devoted to the topic.\nThe study was small, with only 16 volunteers training on the specially designed game.\nGazzaley and other brain experts said bigger studies were needed to assess whether the game could actually help people function in their everyday lives."}
