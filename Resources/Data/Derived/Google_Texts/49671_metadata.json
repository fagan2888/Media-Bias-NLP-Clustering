We checked back.\n\nPendleton says there\u2019s still a problem and it\u2019s only getting worse. An internist, Pendleton begins most days by picking up the trash which litters his office lawn.\n\nIt\u2019s an odd job for a medical doctor but Pendleton says it\u2019s just a part of the daily routine. Hundreds still come to his office each week, prompting critics to argue Pendleton is cutting corners.\n\nBut Pendleton says he is meeting a need left by a healthcare vacuum created by these three factors:\n\na growing uninsured or underinsured population\n\nfunding shortfalls which shift the burden of care to County Health Districts\n\nlow reimbursement rates for physicians\n\nWe asked where Pendleton\u2019s patients \u2013 who number in the hundreds each week and who are mostly adult with either chronic illnesses or injuries \u2013 where they would go if he chose not to see them.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d was his reply. And then, \u201c I think the large need for primary care, does drive that engine.\"\n\nDr. Mary Dahlen Peterson of the Nueces County Medical Society, agrees. \u201cI think we do have a shortage of primary care physicians. Especially, adult primary care.\"\n\nPeterson also noted another trend: With stroke and mental health needs on the rise, Corpus Christi is increasingly short on Neurologists and Psychiatrists, too.\n\nAnd the Texas Medical Association tells us that about 6 million Texans are not insured. That\u2019s the highest in the nation.\n\nCombine that with Texas\u2019 decision to opt-out of Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act and, according to a TMA board member, and it puts a \u201csevere economic burden to the state as well as these patients.\u201d\n\nNot to mention, Medicaid reimbursement rates are so low some doctors cannot afford to care for Medicaid patients. Pendleton says any primary care doctor or internist must choose another motivation for staying in business.\n\n\u201c(They) may not get the glory but they will get some satisfaction. And it'll help the community.\"", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "6 Investigates introduced you\u00a0to Dr. Michael Pendleton last year when we found people sleeping on the ground outside his Weber Road practice.\u00a0We checked back.
