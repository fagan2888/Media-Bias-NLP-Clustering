Chuck Schumer (D-NY) in protest, one of the bill\u2019s principal sponsors.\n\nThe mind boggles at the thought that Congress would let a foreign government decide when America goes to war, so here is the language (PDF):\n\nIf the government of Israel is compelled to take military action in legitimate self-defense against Iran\u2019s nuclear weapon program, the United States Government should stand with Israel and provide, in accordance with the law of the United States and the constitutional responsibility of Congress to authorize the use of military force, diplomatic, military and economic support to the Government of Israel in its defense of its territory, people and existence.\n\nThis section is legally nonbinding, but given the clout of the bill\u2019s chief supporter outside of Congress \u2014 the American-Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC [PDF]), leader of the pro-Israel lobby \u2014 that is a mere formality.\n\nSince AIPAC wants this bill passed, it follows that so does the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who opposes American negotiations with Iran and has repeatedly threatened to attack the Islamic Republic. Against all evidence, Netanyahu insists the purpose of Iran\u2019s nuclear program is to build a weapon with which to attack Israel. Iran says its facilities, which are routinely inspected, are for peaceful civilian purposes: the generation of electricity and the production of medical isotopes.\n\nThe bill, whose other principal sponsors are Sen. Robert Menendez (D-NJ) and Sen. Mark Kirk (R-IL), has a total of 26 Senate cosponsors. If it passes when the Senate reconvenes in January, it could provoke a historic conflict between Congress and President Obama, whose administration is engaged in negotiations with Iran at this time. Aside from declaring that the U.S. government should assist Israel if it attacks Iran, the bill would also impose new economic sanctions on the Iranian people. Obama has asked the Senate not to impose additional sanctions while his administration and five other governments are negotiating with Iran on a permanent settlement of the nuclear issue.\n\nA six-month interim agreement is now in force, one provision of which prohibits new sanctions on Iran. \u201cThe [Menendez-Schumer-Kirk] bill allows Obama to waive the new sanctions during the current talks by certifying every 30 days that Iran is complying with the Geneva deal and negotiating in good faith on a final agreement,\u201d Ali Gharib writes at Foreign Policy magazine. That would effectively give Congress the power to undermine negotiations. As Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Javad Zarif, told Time magazine, if Congress imposes new sanctions, even if they are delayed for six months, \u201cThe entire deal is dead. We do not like to negotiate under duress.\u201d\n\nClearly, the bill is designed to destroy the talks with Iran, which is bending over backward to demonstrate that its nuclear program has no military aims.\n\nNetanyahu and Israel\u2019s American supporters in and out of Congress loathe the prospect of an American-Iranian rapprochement after 34 years of U.S.-Israeli covert and proxy war against Iran, whose 1979 Islamic revolution followed a quarter-century of brutality at the hands of a U.S.-backed monarch. The Israeli government, AIPAC, and the Republicans and Democrats who do their bidding in Congress are on record opposing any agreement that would leave intact Iran\u2019s ability to enrich uranium, even at low levels for peaceful civilian purposes. But insisting that Iran cease all enrichment of uranium is equivalent to obliterating any chance of a peaceful settlement with Iran and making war more likely. That\u2019s what this bill is all about.\n\nAmericans should refuse to let Congress give Israel the power to drag the United States into war. American and Israeli intelligence agencies say repeatedly that Iran has no nuclear-weapons program. Though Iran champions the Palestinians, who live under Israeli occupation, it has not threatened Israel, which, remember, is itself a nuclear power.\n\nBut even if Iran were a threat to Israel, that would not warrant letting any foreign government dictate when we go to war.\n\nThis column originally appeared on the Future of Freedom Foundation.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "The American people should know that a pending bill could commit the United States to go to war against Iran.", "title": "Don't Let Other Countries Declare War For America", "url": "http://reason.com/archives/2013/12/27/dont-let-other-countries-declare-war-for", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/13880783888315.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@reason", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/13880783888315.jpg", "description": "The American people should know that pending right now in\nCongress is a bipartisan bill that would virtually commit the\nUnited States to go to war against Iran if Israel attacks the\nIslamic Republic. \u201cThe bill outsources any decision about resort to\nmilitary action to the government of Israel,\u201d Columbia University\nIran expert Gary Sick&nbsp;wrote&nbsp;to\nSen.
