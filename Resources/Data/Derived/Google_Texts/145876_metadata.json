It included action items such as freezing the maximum Pell Grant award amount for the 10-year budget window, as well as repealing the Affordable Care Act, more commonly referred to as Obamacare.\n\nPell Grants are direct grants awarded to students with financial need who have not received a bachelor\u2019s or professional degree, according to the Free Application for Federal Student Aid website. The current maximum award amount for the 2015-16 award year is $5,775, according to the website.\n\nCalifornia Rep. Eric Swalwell said freezing Pell Grants hit home for him during a college media call Wednesday. Swalwell said he was only able to finish school through the use of financial aid and still holds $100,000 in student loan debt.\n\n\u201cPresident Obama and House Democrats have expanded Pell Grants in the past, but the GOP budget is going to freeze them in place so they don\u2019t expand with the cost of living,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to the House of Representatives Budget Committee, the freezing of Pell Grants makes the program \u201cpermanently sustainable so that it is able to serve students today and in the future.\u201d\n\nThe budget also repeals the ACA, which young Americans should take personally, said Natasha McKenzie, president of College Democrats of America.\n\n\u201cThe ability to know that I can stay on my parents\u2019 insurance and then go out into the world and take risks is something I need in my early career to ensure I have a chance to get ahead like everybody else,\u201d McKenzie said on the call. \u201cThat is why the GOP\u2019s budget is devastating to young people like me.\u201d\n\nMcKenzie said 5.7 million young Americans have health insurance through the ACA and another 2.3 million have the ability to stay on their parents\u2019 insurance.\n\nJames Alford, a fourth-year in international studies and psychology and the former president of the OSU College Democrats, said he thinks many students benefit from the ACA.\n\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act is extremely popular among young people,\u201d he said. \u201cBeing able to stay on parents\u2019 health insurance until 26 has made college a more affordable reality for many Americans.\u201d\n\nThe House of Representatives Budget Committee noted repealing the ACA would save $2 trillion.\n\nLevi Cramer, a second-year in political science and a spokesman for the OSU College Republicans, said he believes keeping the ACA would hurt students more if it were kept than if it was repealed.\n\n\u201cWhen looking to repealing the Affordable Care Act, it\u2019s important to realize that that doesn\u2019t automatically mean a college student is going to be dropped from their parent\u2019s coverage,\u201d he said. \u201cBefore the days of Obamacare, many plans allowed parents to keep their children on their plan, so long as they were at least part-time students.\u201d\n\nDuring the call, DNC Chairwoman and Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz referred to a budget as a moral document.\n\n\u201cA budget is a document that really lays out where your priorities are,\u201d Wasserman-Shultz said. \u201cIn this case, it is abundantly clear where the GOP has laid theirs. In exchange for tax cuts for the wealthy and big corporations, they want to throw young people off their health insurance and gut Pell Grants for low and middle income families.\u201d\n\nAlford, of the OSU College Democrats, said he sees the Republicans\u2019 actions as harmful to college students.\n\n\u201cThe attack on Pell Grants obviously makes it more difficult for college students to pay for college, which is already extremely expensive,\u201d Alford said. \u201cIt\u2019s an attack on both students\u2019 rights and students\u2019 abilities to educate themselves. Everyone knows that a successful Western economy runs best with well-educated people and it\u2019s just really sad to see this sort of deterioration.\u201d\n\nBut Cramer said he thinks the plan will fiscally benefit Americans.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a good thing that we are seeing a balanced budget be proposed,\u201d he said. \u201cToo often, Congress spends more than they have in an attempt to create an ideal world, when (in) reality, we need to be sure that we\u2019re cutting back our spending to meet the revenues they\u2019re taking in.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"specificfeeds-verification-code-dG1NZUVtOXBuSXdvOCttbDlIVTZtRDRXMVZySzN6aVdrdVB0Uys1QjVDYnBZY0ZVWFhkYm5aRXprL2ZRS2dHYWRhRXNoZjFaWklXUFBTWnZaR1dFRHU5dXZPT1dDMnU4WFlGdjljblJmT2MzYVhJV09GZ3J0L0JHK3gwTWtSWUt8NmpBM0JZdmJhMXkwYmd3aFpEY28xWmdVbnFCM1dwdXBlcHpQYTEyc3FZYz0=": "ypqULRFCFZdhvCllgQBq", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde791\"", "article_summary": "\u201cPresident Obama and House Democrats have expanded Pell Grants in the past, but the GOP budget is going to freeze them in place so they don\u2019t expand with the cost of living,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe attack on Pell Grants obviously makes it more difficult for college students to pay for college, which is already extremely expensive,\u201d Alford said.\nCalifornia Rep.
