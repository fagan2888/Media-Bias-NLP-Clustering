Agence France Presse/Getty Images\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping is set to unveil a $46 billion infrastructure spending plan in Pakistan that is a centerpiece of Beijing\u2019s ambitions to open new trade and transport routes across Asia and challenge the U.S. as the dominant regional power.\n\nThe plan, known as the China Pakistan Economic Corridor, draws on a newly expansive Chinese foreign policy and pressing economic and security concerns at home for Mr. Xi, who is expected to arrive in Pakistan on Monday. Many details had yet to be announced publicly.\n\n\u201cThis is going to be a game-changer for Pakistan,\u201d said Ahsan Iqbal, Pakistan\u2019s planning minister, who said his country could link China with markets in Central Asia and South Asia.\n\n\u201cIf we become the bridge between these three engines of growth, we will be able to carve out a large economic bloc of about 3 billion living in this part of the world\u2026nearly half the planet.\u201d\n\nBeijing\u2019s primary concern is that instability in neighboring Pakistan and Afghanistan is spilling into China\u2019s predominantly Muslim northwest, and could grow worse with the withdrawal of U.S. troops from the region.\n\nWSJ Frontiers Newsletter Enter your email to sign up for WSJ Frontiers\u2019 weekly newsletter\n\nChina sees a historic opportunity to redraw the geopolitical map by succeeding where the U.S. has largely failed, building critical infrastructure that could kick-start economic growth and open new trade routes between China and Central and South Asia. A cornerstone of the project will be to develop the Pakistani port of Gwadar, a warm-water port run by the Chinese on the doorstep of the Middle East.\n\nIf realized, the plan would be China\u2019s biggest splurge on economic development in another country to date. It aims over 15 years to create a 2,000-mile economic corridor between Gwadar and northwest China, with roads, rail links and pipelines crossing Pakistan.\n\nThe network ultimately will link to other countries as well, potentially creating a regional trading boom, Pakistani and Chinese officials say.\n\nContinue reading at wsj.com.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Beijing aims to succeed where the U.S. has largely failed, spending $46 billion on infrastructure projects in Pakistan.", "title": "China to Unveil Billions of Dollars in Pakistan Spending", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/frontiers/2015/04/16/china-to-unveil-billions-of-dollars-in-pakistan-spending/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-HX620_PAKCHI_P_20150416134012.jpg"}, "site": "frontiermarkets", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "China to Unveil Billions of Dollars in Pakistan Spending", "description": "Beijing aims to succeed where the U.S. has largely failed, spending $46 billion on infrastructure projects in Pakistan.", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Saeed Shah and Jeremy Page", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "Frontier Markets Blog", "page.subsection": "Frontier Markets", "article.summary": "Beijing aims to succeed where the U.S. has largely failed, spending $46 billion on infrastructure projects in Pakistan.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2015-04-16T21:37:03-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-141", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/frontiers/2015/04/16/china-to-unveil-billions-of-dollars-in-pakistan-spending/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-265B-1801", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Beijing aims to succeed where the U.S. has largely failed, spending $46 billion on infrastructure projects in Pakistan.", "title": "China to Unveil Billions of Dollars in Pakistan Spending", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/frontiers/2015/04/16/china-to-unveil-billions-of-dollars-in-pakistan-spending/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-HX620_PAKCHI_P_20150416134012.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Frontier Markets", "article.id": "BL-265B-1801", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-04-16T21:37:26-04:00"}, "article_summary": "The plan, known as the China Pakistan Economic Corridor, draws on a newly expansive Chinese foreign policy and pressing economic and security concerns at home for Mr. Xi, who is expected to arrive in Pakistan on Monday.\nA cornerstone of the Chinese investment project will be to develop the Pakistani port of Gwadar, on the doorstep of the Middle East.\nIt aims over 15 years to create a 2,000-mile economic corridor between Gwadar and northwest China, with roads, rail links and pipelines crossing Pakistan.\nThe network ultimately will link to other countries as well, potentially creating a regional trading boom, Pakistani and Chinese officials say.\nA cornerstone of the project will be to develop the Pakistani port of Gwadar, a warm-water port run by the Chinese on the doorstep of the Middle East."}
