really cannot afford the unpleasant surprises she has faced this year concerning which doctors are in her health plan\u2019s network \u2014 and she wonders if insurers have any obligations to keep their provider lists updated.\n\n\u201cThis is shameful on the industry,\u201d Smith said. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about people\u2019s lives.\u201d\n\nYes, federal officials said when The Palm Beach Post asked about a question she raised \u2014 an insurer\u2019s provider directory is supposed to be updated no less than once a month.\n\n\u201cWhile changes are typical between a health plan and their network, there are specific regulations and communication requirements to make sure enrollees have access to benefits,\u201d said a statement provided by the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services. \u201cWe work with states to make sure health plans are fully compliant with the rules and regulations.\u201d\n\nFederal officials did not address a question on penalties, but said they are working to further strengthen network adequacy requirements.\n\nBeginning in 2017, U.S. officials \u201cwill require the issuer to provide written notice to all enrollees who are patients seen on a regular basis by the provider or receive primary care from the provider of discontinuation of a provider 30 days prior to the effective date of the change or otherwise as soon as practicable.\u201d\n\nIn cases where a provider is terminated without cause, officials \u201cwill require issuers to allow enrollees in active treatment to continue treatment until the treatment is complete or for 90 days (whichever is shorter) at in-network cost-sharing rates.\u201d\n\nAs The Post reported, consumers say they checked on which doctors were in network for Florida Blue, or Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Florida, before signing up for 2016 Obamacare coverage \u2014 only to find those doctors were not necessarily in the plan in the early months of the year.\n\nCompany officials have apologized and said they are working hard to solve these problems in Palm Beach County, among other places.\n\nSmith said these are not minor issues for people with conditions like cancer.\n\n\u201cBeside the fact I want to cry and punch the wall, I\u2019m petrified,\u201d Smith said.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Protecting Your Pocket", "generator":
