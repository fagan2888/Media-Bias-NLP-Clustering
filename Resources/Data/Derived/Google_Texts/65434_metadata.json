(The city is now known as Luxor.)\n\nAs archaeologists excavated the site earlier this month, they found remnants of bodies covered in a thick layer of lime. The lime was significant, as it was used in the ancient world as a form of disinfectant to prevent contamination.\n\nNearby, there was evidence of an enormous bonfire, used to incinerate the remains of plague victims, and three kilns used for lime production.\n\nPottery located in the kilns enabled the scientists to date the discovery to the middle of the third century, the time of a gruesome epidemic known as the \u201cplague of Cyprian.\u201d\n\nCyprian, the mid-third century bishop of Carthage, provides us with the most detailed description of the plague\u2019s terrible effects. In his essay \u201cDe mortalitate\u201d (\"On Mortality\"), Cyprian wrote:\n\n\u201cThe intestines are shaken with a continual vomiting; the eyes are on fire with the infected blood; that in some cases the feet or some parts of the limbs are taken off by the contagion of diseased putrefaction.\u201d\n\nIn many cases, Cyprian went on to say, blindness and deafness would ensue.\n\nAt its height the epidemic is estimated to have killed 5,000 people a day in the city of Rome alone. Among them were two Roman emperors: Hostilian and Claudius II Gothicus.\n\nThe effects were just as extreme elsewhere in the empire. Sociologist Rodney Stark writes that as much as two-thirds of the population in Alexandria, Egypt, died.\n\nModern scientists may believe that the disease was smallpox, but to Cyprian it was a portent of the end of the world. Interestingly, this belief may have actually helped the spread of Christianity.\n\nCyprian noted that Christians were also dying from the plague, but suggested that only non-Christians had anything to fear.\n\nHis compatriot Dionysius, bishop of Alexandria - one of the most hard-hit areas - wrote that it was a period of unimaginable joy for Christians.\n\nThe fact that even Roman emperors were dying and pagan priests had no way to explain or prevent the plague only strengthened the Christian position.\n\nThe experience of widespread disease and death and the high probability that they themselves might die made Christians more willing to embrace martyrdom.\n\nAnd that, somewhat paradoxically, helped the faith thrive, providing early publicity that Christianity is worth dying for.\n\nAdd to this the fact that the epidemic coincided with the first Roman legislation affecting Christians, and martyrdom became both a possibility and a more reasonable option: When death is always around the corner, why not make yours count?\n\nAs the martyr Apollonius is reported to have said at his trial, \u201cIt is often possible for dysentery and fever to kill; so I will consider that I am being destroyed by one of these.\u201d\n\nThe harrowing images of putrefying bodies and burning pyres of corpses also influenced early Christian descriptions of hell and the afterlife, which were already filled with fire and brimstone.\n\nWith the spread of the plague, these threats seemed increasingly real. Now that hell had become a place on earth, Christians were increasingly eager to avoid it in the afterlife.\n\nThe epidemic that seemed like the end of the world actually promoted the spread of Christianity.\n\nCandida Moss is a professor of New Testament and early Christianity at the University of Notre Dame and author of \"The Myth of Persecution.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "By Candida Moss, special to CNN (CNN)\u00a0-- Archaeologists in Egypt have unearthed relics from an apocalyptic plague that some Christians believed heralded\u00a0the end of the world -- an idea that likely helped spread the faith centuries ago.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "title": "How an apocalyptic plague helped spread Christianity", "og": {"url": "http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2014/06/23/how-an-apocalyptic-plague-helped-christianity/", "image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/140623090755-plague-of-cyprian-0623-story-top.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "By Candida Moss, special to CNN\r\n\r\n(CNN)\u00a0-- Archaeologists in Egypt have unearthed relics from an apocalyptic plague that some Christians believed heralded\u00a0the end of the world -- an idea that likely helped spread the faith centuries ago.", "title": "How an apocalyptic plague helped spread Christianity"}, "msvalidate.01": "DE341CAC7D45B696ED1776216C18054C", "fb": {"admins": 690014395, "app_id": 80401312489}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CNN Belief Blog", "keywords": "archaeology, christianity, death, egypt, end times, cyprian, early christianity, egypt, plague of cyprian", "google-site-verification": "mFBa4OnyEDU23vgVJ6rtX_4izud7FIi9JiscfVsWaKk", "original-source": "http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2014/06/23/how-an-apocalyptic-plague-helped-christianity/", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico"}, "article_summary": "Interestingly, this belief may have actually helped the spread of Christianity.\nThe epidemic that seemed like the end of the world actually promoted the spread of Christianity.\nBy Candida Moss, special to CNN(CNN) - Archaeologists in Egypt have unearthed relics from an apocalyptic plague that some Christians believed heralded the end of the world - an idea that likely helped spread the faith centuries ago.\nNearby, there was evidence of an enormous bonfire, used to incinerate the remains of plague victims, and three kilns used for lime production.\nThe lime was significant, as it was used in the ancient world as a form of disinfectant to prevent contamination."}
