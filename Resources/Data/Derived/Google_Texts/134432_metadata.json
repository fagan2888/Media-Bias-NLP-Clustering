John Hickenlooper\u2019s flurry of activity to siphon funds from the hospital provider \u201cfee\u201d in order to feed a larger general fund, we\u2019ve stood firm. Why? Because enterprising this fund would be an end run around our Taxpayer Bill of Rights and deny Coloradans the tax refunds we deserve to put back in our pockets.\n\nTABOR is a state constitutional amendment protecting Colorado taxpayers against unnecessary tax increases and runaway government spending. First, state tax increases must be put to the voters, which we have voted down by huge margins in recent years. And second, the state must issue tax refunds when total revenues for a given year exceed inflation and population growth. Thanks to this provision, Coloradans are set to recoup $154 million of our hard-earned money as a tax refund this year, with even more to come in years ahead.\n\nWhen the governor found out that our activists were against his strategy to circumvent TABOR, he suggested that we give him some ideas on other ways to increase state revenues. Well, Gov. Hickenlooper, we reject the premise of this challenge and instead suggest that the state tighten its belt.\n\nHere\u2019s how. Start spending our money more wisely and efficiently. We already pay plenty of money to the government. In fact, revenues from taxes and fees have grown 43 percent in recent years \u2014 from $8.6 billion in 2010 to a projected $12.3 billion last year.\n\nRevenues aren\u2019t the problem. The problem, as Colorado Senate President Bill Cadman wisely points out, is Colorado lawmakers\u2019 \u201cspending addiction.\u201d State government spending grew 38 percent faster in 2014 than it did throughout the 1990s, according to the Independence Institute.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just how much money lawmakers spend, but also where which causes budgetary problems.\n\nThe expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act stands out as an example. Colorado\u2019s state Medicaid spending and related programs grew 64 percent between 2013 and 2015. That includes our notoriously costly state insurance exchange, Colorado Connect, currently running a $13.3 million deficit. In fact, Medicaid now takes up over 30 percent of general fund spending. That leaves increasingly less money to spend on other needs.\n\nAnother example is the cost incurred by our bloated state pension system. Colorado\u2019s Public Employees Retirement Association has $23 billion in unfunded liabilities \u2014 promises we have no current means of paying for. In an attempt to prop up this failed pension system, schools are forced to pay a rate of nearly 20 percent into PERA \u2014 meaning less education money actually gets into the classroom. Reforming PERA\u2019s crisis\u2013in\u2013waiting is essential to protecting Colorado\u2019s economy and fiscal stability.\n\nIn addition, the Independence Institute has identified numerous other reforms that legislators could enact, without changing the state constitution, which could save the state hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nNo one ever said making these tough budget decisions would be easy, but circumventing our Taxpayer Bill of Rights and taking more money out of every Coloradan\u2019s pocket is inexcusable.\n\nWhen Gov. Hickenlooper was asked why his proposal wasn\u2019t being sent to the people for a vote as required by TABOR, he told the Denver Post he thinks it \u201cwouldn\u2019t win approval\u201d because Coloradans \u201cdon\u2019t want to give any more money, in any way, to government.\u201d He added, \u201cI don\u2019t think that necessarily means that\u2019s the best thing for the state.\u201d\n\nWell, we happen to trust Coloradans to know if it is prudent and necessary to send more of their hard-earned money to fund expanded government programs. The governor should too.\n\nMichael Fields is the state director of Americans for Prosperity-Colorado.\n\nThis article has been corrected from an earlier version, which misstated how much schools are required to pay into PERA.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Colorado Statesman", "description": "Amid Gov.
