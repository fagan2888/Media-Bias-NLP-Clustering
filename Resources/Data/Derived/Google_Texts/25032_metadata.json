They're thrilled. Everybody's got a job, everybody's in school. Everybody's good. So we're very happy about that,\" said Theresa Donatiello Neidich, FISH Hospitality Program Inc. executive director and social worker. \"It's wonderful.\"\n\nDonatiello Neidich said it makes her feel good.\n\n\"It's why we do what we do,\" said Donatiello Neidich, who has asked the woman to write a guest's corner letter for the organization's monthly newsletter.\n\nFISH Hospitality Program Inc. allows guests to stay in the emergency shelter for 60 days during which time Donatiello Neidich works with them to get food stamps, and other assistance, such as jobs, social services and resume preparation.\n\nLast spring, FISH Hospitality Program Inc. opened a new day center, down the street at St. Francis Episcopal Church in neighboring Dunellen. The Middlesex church that housed the former day center was sold and the center had been housed on an interim basis at the Rose of Sharon Community Church in Plainfield for more than a year, she said.\n\nSt. Francis Episcopal Church had supported one of the program's host churches in the past and now the church supports Christ United Methodist Church in Piscataway when guests are housed there.\n\n\"Literally you can walk, it's that close. They are wonderful,\" said Donatiello Neidich, who works out of an office on New Market Road in a building upstairs from Fish, Inc - Dunellen Area, a separate volunteer organization offering a food bank, clothing, blankets, bedding, holiday meals, and Christmas toys.\n\nDonatiello Neidich said the day center is for guests who are not working, or have a day off from work, perhaps due to illness. The church offered its facilities rent free, and a business cell phone is available for guests to use.\n\nA new computer for job search\n\nShe said community donations from the Needy Cases Fund last year were used to get a new computer at the day center for guests to use, especially since most job ads are online. She said a new printer is needed for the day center and her assistant needs a new computer.\n\nThe program currently has 13 guests, all of whom are working.\n\n\"We had a mass exodus. Everyone left at once in the last group. So we brought in everybody in the month of September and everyone has one kid. One parent has two children, the rest have one,\" she said.\n\nThe program has a waiting list of 132 family units \u2014 a sign the need is as great as ever. As of October, the program has seen an increase of about 84 calls from last year, 32 more from Middlesex County and 26 more from Union County. From Somerset County, the number of calls has doubled from 12 last year to 26 this year. Eight family units from Somerset County have been served this year, including one with a man as the head of the household. Last year only one family from Somerset County were program guests.\n\n\"In Somerset County they only serve people who are on welfare in their shelters so they have to have a voucher from the Board of Social Services. We take the working poor, we don't require them to have a voucher,\" said Donatiello Neidich, who feels welfare recipients are eligible for other forms of assistance.\n\n\"We can only serve 14 people at a time,\" said Donatiello Neidich, adding people are not just out of work, they are under employed. She said homeless people are not just those living on the street or in shelters, homeless people also are \"couch surfing\" with friends and relatives for a few weeks at a time.\n\nFish Hospitality Program Inc is connected with Family Promise, a program with about 186 affiliates including several in New Jersey.\n\nAs part of that affiliation Donatiello Neidich said FISH Hospitality Program Inc. will conduct a April 18, 2015 Box City fundraiser in which people can sponsor teens sleeping overnight in decorated cardboard boxes, symbolizing homelessness, on the lawn of The Presbyterian Church in Westfield.\n\nIt was through Family Promise that Donatiello Neidich learned about Recycled Rides, a National Auto Body Council community service program in which insurers, collision repair shops, paint suppliers, parts vendors and others collaborate to repair and donate salvaged vehicles to needy individuals, families or service organizations.\n\nBuy Photo Theresa Donatiello Neidich, is the FISH Hospitality Program executive director.

We get them what they need to start. If they leave with a cushion, they are OK,\" said Donatiello Neidich, who has a graduate student from Rutgers who is doing a management and administration internship with her.\n\n\"We have eight people ready to move but can't move because they don't have enough money to move out. I really need like $6,000 immediately. The individual donations are not coming in like they use to,\" she said.\n\nDonatiello Neidich added that the program lost a Plainfield hosting church in 2012.\n\n\"They were doing five weeks a year. We've been scrambling and stretching our churches to do more weeks,\" said Donatiello Neidich, adding with 52 weeks a year and 13 host churches, not all of them can do five or six weeks a year. Each church can only do 14 days in a row. \"We have five weeks open in our (2015) schedule. Ideally we need two more churches.\"\n\nIf your church would like take part in the program, contact Donatiello Neidich directly at 732-968-5957.\n\nStaff Writer Suzanne Russell: 732-565-7335; srussell@mycentraljersey.com\n\nGet engaged, take action\n\nFrom Nov. 30 to Dec. 7, we are highlighting the stories of eight organizations helped by the Needy Cases Fund.
