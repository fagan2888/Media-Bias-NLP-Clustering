The survey was sent to over 80 percent of doctors in all active patient care, or some 650,000 physicians, to reveal their perspectives on the healthcare system.\n\nSpecialists, whose practices have traditionally thrived under fee-for-service rules, said patients in rural areas may have trouble finding specialists under the new reimbursement protocols. Only 35 percent of physicians described their practices as independent, down from 62 percent just seven years ago, the survey reported.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re really losing ready access in many parts of the country that are rural,\u201d Bruce Sigsbee, a neurologist who works for a hospital system in Rockport, ME and immediate past president of the American Academy of Neurology, told Bloomberg Business. \u201cThere does seem to be a perceived push for people to leave independent practice by these policies.\u201d\n\n\u201cAvoid single payer without a private alternative,\u201d commented one physician in the survey. \u201cAnd stop this silly talk about doing away with fee-for-service. It will only increase the movement of physicians becoming clock-watching salarymen.\u201d\n\nAs Healthcare Dive points out, there is a deep generational divide among physicians revealed by the survey. Whereas 90 percent of new physicians are participating in ACOs \u2013 as opposed to opening up or working in independent practices \u2013 older physicians are still clinging tightly to the independent model.\n\n\u201cWhile some physicians have elected to participate in new delivery models such as ACOs, and while most have adopted electronic medical records, many are dubious about the benefits of these models and systems and do not believe they will achieve cost or quality gains,\u201d the survey states. \u201cThough one-third of physicians participate in state or federal exchanges/marketplaces established by the Affordable Care Act, close to the same number have no plans to do so. Almost half of physicians give the ACA a low to failing grade, while only one quarter give it a positive to excellent grade, though opinions of the ACA and many other topics vary among 'new guard' and 'old guard' physicians.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. health secretary, Sylvia Mathews Burwell, announced Jan. 26 she wants at least 30 percent of Medicare\u2019s $362 billion in fee-for-service payments moved, by 2017, into new programs that demand accountability from doctors and hospitals and in some cases penalize them if their care doesn\u2019t meet quality and efficiency standards. The fraction would rise to 50 percent by 2019.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"description": "<p>Specialists may be forced to close or merge as a result of Medicare&rsquo;s value-based approach. <em>By Christine Kern, contributing writer</em></p>", "creator": "Christine Kern", "image": {"src": "http://vertassets.blob.core.windows.net/image/83e8605b/83e8605b-1377-4c17-9287-d7db1b644e6a/hto_keyboard_with_pay_button.jpg"}, "title": "Value-Based Payments Hurting Specialists", "site": "HITOutcomes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "Specialists may be forced to close or merge as a result of Medicare&rsquo;s value-based approach.
