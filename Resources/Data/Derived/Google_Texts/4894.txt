House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., takes questions from reporters about the stunning primary defeat of House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., by an underfunded and unknown tea party challenger, during a news conference at the Capitol in Washington, Thursday, June 12, 2014. The California Democrat said she’s hopeful that the House can still move on issues like an immigration overhaul, despite concerns that Cantor’s departure could drive House Republicans further to the right, possibly making compromise less likely.

LOS ANGELES (KOIN 6) — Nancy Pelosi: House minority leader, Affordable Care Act advocate and…reality television judge?

It appears so, as Congresswoman Pelosi (D-Calif) announced Monday via Twitter she’d been invited to be a guest judge on TLC’s “Next Great Baker.” And Pelosi, more than familiar with casting important votes, has apparently already crossed pastry lines.

“Look fwd to tomorrow’s show!” she tweeted.

For all those politically interested, baked good-lovers out there, “Next Great Baker” airs Tuesdays at 9 p.m. ET.
