Companies surveyed included responses from executives at middle-market companies with revenue ranging from $10 million to $1 billion.\n\nAbility to maintain margins, grow revenue and the cost of doing business were the topmost concerns among survey participants, especially among post-acute care providers, says Anil Joseph, managing director with GE Capital\u2019s Healthcare Financial Services.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s some pressure on utilization broadly speaking, however, service providers are optimistic over the long-term,\u201d Joseph told SHN. \u201cMost view the Affordable Care Act as long-term positive, but the expectation is going to be continued pressure on reimbursements.\u201d\n\nThe majority of healthcare services firms expect commercial reimbursement rates to remain flat over the next six to 12 months, while only 29% expect a modest increase, according to GE Capital\u2019s analysis of the surveyed responses.\n\nGiven these expectations, 65% of respondents indicated they anticipate capital spending will remain flat, while 30% expect a modest spending increase in the range of 1% to 5%. Areas where capital spending is likely to focus include replacement of existing equipment, maintenance of infrastructure and new equipment purchases.\n\nFragmentation across many sectors\u2014senior living and home health care included\u2014is triggering more consolidation, while simultaneously forcing others to diversify their service offerings.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing massive consolidation within sectors,\u201d Joseph said. \u201cMost of the sectors are extremely fragmented and we\u2019re seeing more diversification.\u201d\n\nBut whether it\u2019s home health providers acquiring hospice agencies, or skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) and long-term care companies looking to move downstream in the post-acute care continuum, more consolidation has been taking place in recent years among various providers, Joseph added.\n\n\u201cWith reimbursements dropping, providers are going to have to take on more risks,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a lot of providers with goals of building a post-acute care platform in the market and negotiating with payers to provide services for all of them.\u201d\n\nNationally prominent providers like Brookdale Senior Living (NYSE:BKD) and Kindred Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:KND), are among those that have been diversifying, either by providing ancillary services or by trying to build all of the pieces of the post-acute care network together, noted Paul Nevala, vice president of Investment Research Group with GE Capital\u2019s Healthcare Financial Services.\n\nDuring the JMP Securities Financial Services Real Estate Conference last October, Brookdale executives indicated the company sees expansion among its ancillary businesses, particularly in home care and hospice.\n\nThe company\u2019s acquisition earlier this year of Emeritus, which bought Florida-based home health provider Nurse On Call for $102 million in November 2012, adds to Brookdale\u2019s home health offerings.\n\n\u201cWhen looking at a big provider like Brookdale, it can service its independent living residents with its own home health entities,\u201d Nevala said. \u201cWhen managed care plans catch on, it comes down to who can be the best, biggest consolidated players to serve patients.\u201d\n\nWritten by Jason Oliva", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "brookdale senior living, ge capital healthcare financial services, kindred healthcare, business, finance, real estate, senior housing", "og": {"site_name": "Senior Housing News", "description": "Just as reimbursement pressures may spur short-term consolidation within the home health sector, the same may be the case for the senior living and broader healthcare industry as well.
