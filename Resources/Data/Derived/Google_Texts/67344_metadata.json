Richard Hanna (R-NY)\n\nFollowing months of Republican attacks on Planned Parenthood, one GOP congressman is speaking out against his party\u2019s push to defund the women\u2019s health organization.\n\n\u201cDo you really want women not to have access to health care?\u201d Rep. Richard Hanna (R-NY) asked rhetorically Monday during an appearance on the Keeler in the Morning radio show. \u201cAnd do you believe in a woman\u2019s right to have domain over her own body, or the government\u2019s?\u201d\n\nHanna\u2019s remarks came during a discussion about his political future in the Republican Party and the possibility he would face a primary challenge in 2016. Rather than toe the party line on Planned Parenthood, though, Hanna stuck up for what he argued was the group\u2019s mission: \u201cEducating and providing contraception and inexpensive women\u2019s health care.\u201d\n\nIf Republicans were able to successfully outlaw abortion, it would have dire consequences, Hanna warned. \u201cDo you really want it to go to back rooms?\u201d\n\nListen to it (relevant segment begins at 3:45):\n\nBack in September, Hanna was just one of three House Republicans who voted against the Defund Planned Parenthood Act of 2015, dismissing the legislation as \u201cpandering\u201d and \u201cpolitical theater.\u201d In 2014, he was the sole GOP congressman to vote against a bill that prohibited federal subsidies from being used for health insurance plans under Obamacare that covered abortion care. \u201cIndividuals should be free to make that very difficult and personal decision without heavy-handed government involvement,\u201d said in explaining his vote.\n\nHanna\u2019s recent Planned Parenthood defense comes on the heels of unrelenting Republican attacks on the women\u2019s health organization. GOPers have called Planned Parenthood \u201cworse than ISIS\u201c, drawn a connection between Planned Parenthood and \u201cNazi Germany\u201c, and suggested deploying federal troops to stop women from getting abortions. Not all the attacks have been verbal. This fall alone, Planned Parenthood clinics in California and Washington have been set on fire by arsonists, and a clinic in Colorado Springs was the scene of a grisly mass shooting that left three dead at the hands of a shooter who said he was \u201ca warrior for the babies.\u201d\n\nDuring his five years in Congress, Hanna has developed a reputation as a lonely voice speaking out against his party\u2019s excesses. In 2012, as other Republicans like former Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-MN) suggested that an aide of Hillary Clinton was tied to the Muslim Brotherhood, Hanna criticized the GOP for catering \u201cto our extremes\u201d and said that in doing so \u201cWe render ourselves incapable of governing.\u201d More recently, Hanna admitted this fall that the congressional Benghazi Committee was actually \u201cdesigned to go after\u201d Hillary Clinton, despite some Republicans\u2019 insistence otherwise.\n\nHanna has long defended women\u2019s health from other GOPers. In 2012, Hanna\u2019s support for abortion rights earned him the Planned Parenthood Federation of America\u2019s Barry Goldwater Award, which honors Republican lawmakers who stand up for reproductive health issues.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "\"And do you believe in a woman's right to have domain over her own body, or the government's?\" the congressman continued.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "\"And do you believe in a woman's right to have domain over her own body, or the government's?\" the congressman continued.", "title": "GOP Congressman Chastises His Party: \u2018Do You Really Want Women Not To Have Access To Health Care?\u2019", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2015/12/18/3733688/richard-hanna-planned-parenthood/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/14191218/AP_101102185713-600x315.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"And do you believe in a woman's right to have domain over her own body, or the government's?\" the congressman continued.", "creator": "@smkeyes", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/14191218/AP_101102185713-321x214.jpg", "title": "GOP Congressman Chastises His Party: \u2018Do You Really Want Women Not To Have Access To Health Care?\u2019", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/14191218/AP_101102185713-540x303.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/14191218/AP_101102185713-99x66.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-18T08:21:08+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Health GOP Congressman Chastises His Party: \u2018Do You Really Want Women Not To Have Access To Health Care?\u2019 CREDIT: AP Photo/Heather Ainsworth Rep.
