A third of the women going without adjuvant hormone therapy \u2013 that is a scary prospect.\u201d\n\nThe findings highlight a major problem in Appalachia, a region where cancer is a leading cause of death and access to healthcare can be a challenge.\n\n\u201cThis study was one of the first of its kind looking at this region, with not only severe socioeconomic deprivation but geographical barriers to care,\u201d Balkrishnan said. \u201cWomen often have to drive many miles to get to the nearest tertiary cancer center or the pharmacy.\u201d\n\nThe researchers found that women were more likely to stick with an older drug, tamoxifen, than with newer aromatase inhibitors. Balkrishnan said he suspects the findings speak to circumstances specific to the region.\n\n\u201cOne, the diffusion of newer technologies is much slower in Appalachia. Also, the other issue that comes to the forefront is that many of these medications have pretty severe side effects,\u201d he said. \u201cI think what is also happening here is that there are high rates of discontinuance of the medication because a lot of patients are not counseled properly on how to manage the side effects of these medications and how to take medications in conjunction with other aspects of their lifestyles and daily living.\u201d\n\nThe study looked at women living in the Appalachian counties of four states: Kentucky, Ohio, North Carolina and Pennsylvania.\n\n\u201cJust having insurance doesn\u2019t seem to be enough,\u201d Balkrishnan said. \u201cAll the women we followed had Medicare Part D insurance [covering prescription medications]. But clearly in spite of insurance, the use and continuation of these medications, which is recommended at a level of 80 percent or higher, is not there in a third of the population.\u201d\n\nResearchers noted that the study used data collected before the implementation of the federal Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cWe need to see if policies which are being put in place to increase affordability and access to care are actually making a difference,\u201d he said.\n\nThe study results have been published by the scientific journal Medicine.
