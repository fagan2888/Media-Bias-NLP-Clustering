A New York vending-machine honcho claims an ObamaCare mandate to require the posting of calorie information will cost him nearly a million dollars to implement.

Butch Yamali says that fitting his 1,600 machines on Long Island and throughout the five boroughs with new calorie-conscious software will run him about $500 a pop.

“It’s insanity,” he said. “Some of these machines make $30 or $40 a week. It’s just not worth it to keep them when you get hit with something like this.”

As part of Obama’s Affordable Care Act, companies that own more than 10 machines must post calorie figures for all items offered by the end of this year.

The program allows for the installation of new software that electronically displays the information when an item is selected or paper summaries of calorie content.

But Yamali said it would be a logistical impossibility to constantly change paper lists for every machine — and that the pricey software method is the only viable choice.
