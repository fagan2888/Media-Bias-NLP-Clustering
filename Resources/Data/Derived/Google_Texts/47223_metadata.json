Four years later, the family of Agent Terry still waits for answers to not only what happened that night, but the circumstances leading up to Terry\u2019s murder that later became known as Operation Fast and Furious. Two of the guns found at the scene of Terry\u2019s murder were later traced back to the federal law enforcement program that put guns into the hands of criminals.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nBreitbart Texas spoke with Agent Terry\u2019s family about their thoughts as we move into this, the fourth anniversary of his tragic and needless death. \u201cI have been waiting four years for justice for my son Brian, which have been the worst years of my life,\u201d said Brian\u2019s mother Josephine Terry. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for me not to cry when I think I will never see his face again. The loss I feel cannot be described\u201d\n\n\u201cBrian was a truly dedicated American,\u201d Mrs. Terry continued, \u201cwho, as an American, should get the justice he deserves. The effect of Brian\u2019s death on my life is truly over whelming. I am glad I had the privilege and honor to be Brian\u2019s Mom.\u201d\n\nA Facebook event has been organized for Monday, December 15th to honor Brian and remember the sacrifice he and his family have made for our country. Brian\u2019s family would like to invite our readers to \u201cJoin\u201d the event and show your support for this great American hero.\n\n\u201cFour years ago today we lost our American Hero,\u201d said Michelle Terry-Balogh, one of Brian Terry\u2019s sisters. \u201cBrian was killed protecting each and every one of us.\n\n\u201cNot a day goes by that I do not think of him, or wonder why this has happened to our family,\u201d she continued. \u201dBut we are strong and will continue to fight for the justice and truth he deserves. Let\u2019s not morn his death but celebrate who he was, a true American Hero, an all-American Patriot who spent his adult life doing what he loved to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cTake this day and say thank you to those who protect us and serve this country every day. Pay it forward to those who protect us. Make a difference in Brian\u2019s name,\u201d Michelle concluded.\n\nEarlier this year, Kent Terry spoke out about the federal government\u2019s failure to hold those responsible for getting the guns into the hands of the bandits who killed his brother. Breitbart\u2019s Matthew Boyle published a letter from Kent Terry to U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder in Big Government. \u201cI am not pleased with your behavior as America\u2019s Attorney General,\u201d Kent Terry wrote. \u201cSimply denying that you had no knowledge about Operation Fast and Furious is troubling in itself, but for you to not comply with Congress is even more troubling. It is shocking to know that the Attorney General of the United States had no knowledge or was not made aware of Fast and Furious until after the death of my brother, Brian Terry.\u201d\n\nWhile more documents about the Fast and Furious scandal have finally been disclosed to the Congressional oversight committees, Brian Terry\u2019s family still must deal with their pain brought on by the lack of answers. The family, however, has remained strong and positive in the face of the disrespect they have received from Eric Holder and the White House. They choose instead to honor Brian and the excellence he stood for.\n\n\u201cI wanted to take a minute and thank everyone who supports the Terry family in getting justice for Brian,\u201d Kent Terry said to this writer. \u201cIt means a lot to me and my family. It is greatly appreciated.\u201d\n\n\u201cBrian wrote a poem that described how he lived his life. It is titled, \u2018If Today is to be the Day\u2026 So Be It.\u2019 It saddens me that we still don\u2019t have answers for, or accountability for, Brian\u2019s senseless death,\u201d Kent continued, \u201dA death caused by the ATF and other agencies.\u201d\n\n\u201cBrian deserves better,\u201d he stated. \u201cHe did spill his blood on this soil protecting Americans. Now that documents are out, I expect Congress to follow Brian\u2019s poem and let \u2018Today be the Day\u2019 they respect him and give him answers he so well deserves.\u201d\n\nBrian Terry\u2019s poem is read in this tribute video:\n\nIn an effort to keep Brian\u2019s memories alive and to help other Border Patrol families who have lost an agent in the line of duty, the Terry family established the Brian Terry Foundation. During the Fall, a Michigan businessman Erik \u201cTrek\u201d Utrecht conducted a fundraising event for the foundation. He raised money by getting people to sponsor him on a 2,000 mile bicycle ride from Detroit Michigan to the Brian Terry Border Patrol Station in Bisbee, Arizona. The trip took approximately 23 days to complete. In March 2015, the Foundation will host a golf tournament in the Fort Worth, Texas area. More information will be available about the tournament in a future article.\n\n\u201cIt has been four years but still feels like four days,\u201d Kelly Terry-Willis told this writer about her brother\u2019s death. \u201cOur family is still seeking justice and until that happens we do not have closure.\u201d\n\n\u201cBrian was an amazing man who lived for the red, white and blue,\u201d she said proudly. \u201cWe need not to forget him and his beautiful soul. Our family is very thankful for all the tremendous support given by family, friends and those we have never met. We will keep fighting!\u201d\n\nAnd fighting is exactly what this family has been forced to do. This writer first wrote about the Terry murder on the day he died \u2013 December 15th, 2010. While looking into the circumstances surrounding his murder, it became apparent very quickly that something was wrong. The government was clearly behaving differently than it had other cases this writer had investigated. After writing more articles, along with several other bloggers, the mainstream media eventually picked up the story. The now former CBS reporter, Sharyl Attkisson, blew the story wide open with a CBS Evening News report on an ATF investigation called \u201cProject Gunrunner.\u201d This eventually evolved into the larger scandal called \u201cOperation Fast and Furious.\u201d\n\nWhile Attorney General Eric Holder has been held in contempt of Congress for failing to answer questions and supply documents subpoenaed by Congress, no one in the Obama Administration has been held accountable for this disastrous operation. Operation Fast and Furious appears to have contributed to the deaths of Brian Terry, ICE Agent Jaime Zapata, and perhaps thousands of Mexican nationals.\n\nBob Price is a senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas and a member of the original Breitbart Texas team.
