She handed off the tails to her best friend from college and ducked out.\n\n\u201cThen I was back, and I ran the pi\u00f1ata line,\u201d the Office of Management and Budget director recalled in an interview, adding that the budget impasse coincided with her 4-year-old son\u2019s birthday as well.\n\nFor Nancy-Ann DeParle, the moment came when her oldest son asked her not to serve as White House deputy chief of staff after she had spent nearly two years overseeing health-care policy. After mentioning it to President Obama aboard the Marine One helicopter, the nation\u2019s chief executive invited the 12-year-old into the Oval Office to explain why Obama needed his mom for a little while longer.\n\nAnd last Tuesday, a senior economist on the Council of Economic Advisers was briefing his boss, Jason Furman, and others on college costs when the meeting ran past 5:15 p.m., the time the economist was supposed to head to his daughter\u2019s day care. An assistant passed Furman a note. \u201cYou have to leave,\u201d Furman, who has two young children himself, told the economist. \u201cI got what I need. We can always follow up tomorrow.\u201d\n\nEven as Democrats tout family-friendly policies as a top priority, those within 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. continue to wrestle with the fact that their own workplace often falls short of those ideals. Obama announced last week that he would host a White House Summit on Working Families on June 23, in part to ease \u201cthe burdens\u201d working women face.\n\nThe United States and European nations announced sanctions against Russian officials over Crimea's vote to break away from Ukraine.

Tobey/The Washington Post)\n\nMore than five years into the administration, the White House has taken several steps to make one of the most demanding offices in America more manageable for working parents. It has expanded paid parental leave, installed more nursing rooms within the complex and provides a low-cost, emergency day-care service. A few of its highest-ranking women \u2014 including Burwell, national security adviser Susan E. Rice and U.N. ambassador Samantha Power \u2014 have kids at home.\n\nAides acknowledge that the benefits offered to the well-paid, white-collar employees at the White House are far better than those available to most low- and middle-income Americans, who often have little time with their children because they are working long hours. But White House officials say they still struggle to reconcile their professional duties with familial duties.\n\nThe majority of top White House aides have grown children, no children or a stay-at-home spouse. That last category includes Burwell and Rice, whose husbands have taken breaks from full-time jobs as a lawyer and journalist, respectively. Senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer has publicly vowed to seek a better work-life balance after he ended up in the hospital twice last year, returning to work the day after being released after treatment for a mini-stroke.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just inherently not a family-friendly place,\u201d DeParle said. \u201cThere\u2019s just no way that life in the West Wing can be, when you\u2019re leaving your house at 6:30 or 6:45 in the morning every single day and being in meetings going from 7:30 in the morning to 8:30 at night.\u201d\n\nSixteen current and former White House officials said in interviews that they knew what they were getting into when they accepted their jobs, and they said that high-powered positions in law and business are similarly time-consuming. Both Mona Sutphen and her husband, Clyde Williams, had served in the Clinton White House when she agreed to be Obama\u2019s deputy chief of staff for policy in 2009. At the time, they had a nearly 4-year-old daughter and a 1 \u00bd-year-old son.\n\n\u201cWe kind of knew this would sort of be a disaster on the home front,\u201d said Sutphen, who served in the post for two years while Williams worked as political director of the Democratic National Committee. \u201cI would not have been comfortable doing it for longer.\u201d\n\nSome White House aides deferred having children until they left. Camille Johnston, Michelle Obama\u2019s former communications director, is a single mother who adopted her daughter after joining Siemens in 2010. She said at a recent event sponsored by Politico that leaving the White House allowed her \u201cto start the adoption process, because I knew that I needed both more financial resources and, most likely, time.\u201d\n\nPoliticians typically stay away from ethnic jokes of any kind, except Irish jokes. In the spirit of St. Patrick's Day, here are some of their best. (JulieAnn McKellogg/The Washington Post)\n\nSenior White House officials earn anywhere from $80,000 to $172,200 a year, according to federal disclosure reports. That is higher than the average American\u2019s salary although below what many top professionals earn in Washington\u2019s private sector.\n\nThe work culture within the White House has begun to shift somewhat, driven by a president and his wife with two teenage daughters and a generation of men and women who are uncomfortable with the idea of putting their family responsibilities on hold.\n\nOn Friday, press secretary Jay Carney didn\u2019t come in until mid-morning \u2014 missing five meetings, by his own count \u2014 so he could attend a school play involving his 8-year-old daughter, who helped narrate the tale of Pocahontas and John Smith.\n\nCouncil of Economic Advisers member Betsey Stevenson spoke about the importance of keeping mothers of young children in the workforce in the White House briefing room Wednesday. She spent half of the next day at home with her sick child before going to the office.\n\nStevenson \u2014 who has a 4-year-old daughter and 1-year-old son \u2014 negotiated over how to maintain her nursing schedule after the White House asked her to come on board.\n\n\u201cWhat I would really like to convey to businesses and to the world, and what I think the White House has internalized, is that if you only choose to have the people who can be there 24-7, you\u2019re going to miss a perspective,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cYou can\u2019t staff the White House with only people have no kids, or who have grown kids, because you will miss a perspective, the range of voices you need to formulate policy that works for all people.\u201d\n\nOutside the White House, an increasing number of women with school-age children are serving in Congress or seeking office. There are at least three senators and eight House members in this category, six of whom are Republicans and five of whom are Democrats. Democrats have seven women with young children, including Michelle Nunn of Georgia, running for the House and the Senate.\n\nRep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.), who was pregnant with her third child when she first ran for Congress and also chairs the Democratic National Committee, said she\u2019s her party\u2019s \u201cchief mom recruiter, because we don\u2019t have that many of us doing that.\u201d At times, she has introduced candidates\u2019 spouses to her husband so they can discuss what it\u2019s like to manage at home during the congressional workweek.\n\nAt the White House, making some concessions to family life has become more acceptable in part because influential men within the administration want it as well. The president has repeatedly told staffers that he endorses time away from the office, aides say. Carney, who also has a 12-year-old son, said he apologized to Obama two years ago for missing a presidential trip to attend his son\u2019s play. \u201cHe just e-mailed back and said, \u2018You made the right call,\u2019 \u201d Carney said.\n\nGene B. Sperling, who just stepped down as director of the National Economic Council, was notorious for working until midnight each day during the Clinton administration. But he now has a 7-year-old daughter and a 19-year-old stepson. When his staffer Brian Deese took five weeks of paternity leave during the 2012 fiscal cliff negotiations, he gave his aides strict instructions not to e-mail or call Deese under any circumstances.\n\nThe attitude of supervisors \u201cmakes all the difference\u201d said Deese, who is now OMB\u2019s deputy director.\n\nThe Obama administration has advocated a series of proposals aimed at promoting workplace flexibility. Obama also signed the Telework Enhancement Act in 2010, making it easier for federal employees to work from home, and has pushed for measures including paid sick leave as well as a more generous child-care tax credit.\n\nLiz Watson, director of workplace justice for women at the National Women\u2019s Law Center, said it would be great if the White House could pilot \u201cthe right to request flexible workplace schedules,\u201d which is the law in countries including Britain and the Netherlands.\n\nBut even those with young children said there were limits to such policies at the White House, which Sperling described as \u201cthe ultimate on-call job.\u201d\n\nMany current officials said they were lucky to have the support of family, friends and paid child-care providers who have pitched in while they were stuck at work. And they said that technological advances have made it much easier to work remotely.\n\nThe daughter of Tina Tchen, Michelle Obama\u2019s chief of staff, was in sixth grade and her son was in college when she started in 2009; Tchen moved her nanny from Chicago to Washington.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s still with us,\u201d Tchen said. \u201cThat\u2019s the way I\u2019ve been able to do that, because I\u2019ve had resources.\u201d\n\nAnd in addition to the events to which the Obamas invite staffers\u2019 families \u2014 a Halloween party in the complex, basketball games, a fireworks viewing on the Fourth of July \u2014 there are the substantive ones that provide perspective. DeParle\u2019s husband and two sons were with her in the House gallery the day the Affordable Care Act passed, a concrete reminder of why she had put in such late nights.\n\nStill, Sperling \u2014 a consummate workaholic who left his White House job March 6 \u2014 said he marveled at his first Sunday night back home in Santa Monica, Calif. When his daughter woke up in the middle of the night and she fell back to sleep with her head on his shoulder, he said, he didn\u2019t have to leave the way he usually did.\n\n\u201cIt is the greatest feeling in the world,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cIt just hit me that for the first time in years, nothing terrible would fall through the cracks if I just stayed with her. It was the feeling of being 100 percent there.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Several Obama aides say they struggle to reconcile demands of their work with duties on the home front.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/eilperin", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Several Obama aides say they struggle to reconcile demands of their work with duties on the home front.", "title": "White House is \u2018the ultimate on-call job\u2019 for workers with children at home", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/white-house-is-the-ultimate-on-call-job-for-workers-with-children-at-home/2014/03/15/d7dde570-aab9-11e3-98f6-8e3c562f9996_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/03/13/National-Politics/Images/AP5904513539971394727252.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@eilperin"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/white-house-is-the-ultimate-on-call-job-for-workers-with-children-at-home/2014/03/15/d7dde570-aab9-11e3-98f6-8e3c562f9996_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Michelle Nunn, White House, White House family friendly, Dan Pfeiffer, Sylvia Matthews Burwell, Sylvia Burwell, Susan Rice, Gene Sperling, Betsey Stevenson, Obama women, Obama working women, Jay Carney, National women's law center, stephanie cutter, camille johnston, Samantha Power, Sam Power, Mona Sutphen, Clyde Williams, Jason Furman", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/eilperin"}, "eomportal-uuid": "d7dde570-aab9-11e3-98f6-8e3c562f9996", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Michelle Nunn, White House, White House family friendly, Dan Pfeiffer, Sylvia Matthews Burwell, Sylvia Burwell, Susan Rice, Gene Sperling, Betsey Stevenson, Obama women, Obama working women, Jay Carney, National women's law center, stephanie cutter, camille johnston, Samantha Power, Sam Power, Mona Sutphen, Clyde Williams, Jason Furman"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8a1d\"", "article_summary": "The majority of top White House aides have grown children, no children or a stay-at-home spouse.\n(JulieAnn McKellogg/The Washington Post)Senior White House officials earn anywhere from $80,000 to $172,200 a year, according to federal disclosure reports.\nStill, Sperling \u2014 a consummate workaholic who left his White House job March 6 \u2014 said he marveled at his first Sunday night back home in Santa Monica, Calif.\n\u201cI would not have been comfortable doing it for longer.\u201dSome White House aides deferred having children until they left.\nBut White House officials say they still struggle to reconcile their professional duties with familial duties."}
