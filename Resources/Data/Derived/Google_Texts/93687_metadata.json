In the first three weeks following his formal entry into the 2016 race (that\u2019s when he infamously stereotyped Mexicans who immigrate to the United States: \u201cThey\u2019re bringing drugs, they\u2019re bringing crime. They\u2019re rapists and some, I assume, are good people\u201d), both Univision and NBC told Trump that because of those remarks the Miss USA pageant, which he partly owns, would be knocked off the air.\n\nThen Macy\u2019s, apparently having taken more than two weeks to read the transcript, announced that it was \u201cdisappointed and distressed by recent remarks about immigrants from Mexico\u201d and would no longer sell Trump\u2019s line of clothing.\n\nThis campaign, up to now, has been nothing but damaging to the Trump name and bottom line.\n\nStill, let us be fair to Trump. Offensive, stupid and hateful as his words may be, he sounds an anti-immigrant theme that has a long and ugly tradition in American politics.\n\nIn the middle of the 19th century, when Catholics from famine-plagued Ireland and Germany came to this then-overwhelmingly Protestant country, they encountered suspicion, bigotry and violence. It was President John Adams who earlier had written, \u201cA free government and the Roman Catholic religion can never exist together in any nation or country.\u201d\n\nCatholic churches and convents were burned in Boston and Philadelphia. The nativist American, or \u201cKnow Nothing,\u201d party in 1854 won smashing election victories in Delaware, Kentucky, Maryland and New England, especially Massachusetts, where the Know-Nothings won every statewide office, including the governorship and both houses of the Legislature. Seventy-five members of Congress won on the anti-Catholic, anti-immigrant ticket.\n\nItalian immigrants were even more unwelcome when they arrived later in the 19th century. So, too, were arrivals from elsewhere in eastern and southern Europe. Working-class and lower-class Americans felt threatened economically by the newcomers. But, beginning around the turn of the century, the intolerance leveled against Jews from Poland and Russia was especially brutal.\n\nBy 1920, bigots, many of whom were well educated and socially prominent, could quote the report from a State Department office that categorized the 120,000 Jews who had entered the country as \u201ctwisted,\u201d \u201c\u200bunassimilable,\u201d \u201cfilthy\u201d and \u201cun-American.\u201d By then, the American Legion opposed all immigration to the United States, purportedly because it was the \u201csource of radicalism.\u201d\n\nWe now know how wrong all those loud voices of exclusion were. We know and cherish the magnificent tapestry all the people from everywhere have created in these United States.\n\nLet us honor those who dared to stand up for the oppressed outsiders, these scared newcomers who dared to travel across the ocean or the continent to a place they had never been, to live among people they had never met, to speak a language, in many cases, they had never heard.\n\nDonald Trump, please meet America.\n\n\u2014 Mark Shields is one of the most widely recognized political commentators in the United States.
