I will say this. This thing has got so crazy that the Rev. [Jeremiah] Wright lost his health care today and blamed the Jews. Listen, I don\u2019t talk about politics with my friends because, you know what? Obama \u2014 Barack Obamas are a dime a dozen \u2014 debonair grifters, man. The good friends \u2014 they\u2019re hard to come by. I will say this about Obamacare \u2014 I hope at this point Barack Obama is simply a liar because, if he is this inept, you and I are Gary Lockwood and Keir Dullea way out past Jupiter with a defective Hal 9000 unit, my friend. We are screwed, and I would like to get home, all right?\u201d\n\nHost Bill O\u2019Reilly tried to get Miller to explain why a lot of Obama\u2019s traditional allies have abandoned him on Obamacare, with the lone exception of Hollywood. Miller warned some of the president\u2019s \u201cdevotees\u201d might take it to an ugly place over Obama\u2019s failings.\n\n\u201cBilly, you have got your own thing with Hollywood,\u201d Miller replied. \u201cA lot of my best friends \u2014 a lot of my dearest people in the world to me are from Hollywood. So that\u2019s your fight to fight\u2026 I will say, this as far as the press goes and as far as Obama goes, I\u2019m kind of watching what I\u2019m saying right now because I find when zealots, pet notions crater, they get nasty about it. It\u2019s my raccoons at the recycling bin at two in the morning. This is not the time to come in and tell all these people how stupid it is. History will show how stupid it\u2019s been. I would just say this to the president in the nicest terms I can. Mr. President, if you liked your apology, you can keep it, all right? How\u2019s that? All I know is I finally started reading some of Obamacare last night to find out what it\u2019s about. I got to page 1297 \u2014 preexisting conditions and is says everything is covered except, quote: \u2018Whatever in God\u2019s name Biden has,\u2019 end quote.\u201d\n\nMiller pointed out that the president was being abandoned by his most ardent supporters.\n\n\u201cListen, man, everybody is cabbing off from this guy,\u201d he added. \u201cThe Clintons disengaged. She can\u2019t have the Hester Prynne stink on her. All the devotees are now Judas goating out of the scene. And I tell you what \u2014 I think Obamacare is an unfair name for this thing. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to the guy. I think this has to be Barack Obamacare and laid down in history. This was his genius notion and I hope he travels through time with it.\u201d\n\nFollow Jeff on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Jeff Poor", "description": "Comedian says president should have to live with the taint of his failed health care plan for the rest of history", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "On Wednesday\u2019s broadcast of FNC\u2019s \u201cThe O\u2019Reilly Factor,\u201d comedian and radio talk show host Dennis Miller reacted to the pitfalls President Barack Obama has faced in recent days due to his 20", "title": "Dennis Miller: \u2018Mr. President, if you liked your apology, you can keep it\u2019 [VIDEO]", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2013/11/13/dennis-miller-mr-president-if-you-liked-your-apology-you-can-keep-it-video/", "image": {"width": 629, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Miller1113-e1384400977843.jpg", "height": 270}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Comedian says president should have to live with his failed healthcare plan for the rest of history", "title": "Dennis Miller: \u2018Mr. President, if you liked your apology, you can keep it\u2019 [VIDEO] Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2013/11/13/dennis-miller-mr-president-if-you-liked-your-apology-you-can-keep-it-video/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Miller1113-e1384400977843.jpg"}, "creator": "@jeff_poor", "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-11-13 23:36:22", "sailthru.title": "Dennis Miller: 'Mr. President, if you liked your apology, you can keep it' [VIDEO]", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "obamacare,jeff-poor", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "obamacare", "sailthru.description": "On Wednesday\u2019s broadcast of FNC\u2019s \u201cThe O\u2019Reilly Factor,\u201d comedian and radio talk show host Dennis Miller reacted to the pitfalls President Barack Obama has faced in recent days due to his 20", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Miller1113-e1384400977843.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Obama \u2014 Barack Obamas are a dime a dozen \u2014 debonair grifters, man.\nMiller said in his view, he hoped Obama had been misleading Americans in the push for Obamacare because otherwise it would indicate a degree of ineptness.\nI think this has to be Barack Obamacare and laid down in history.\nAnd I tell you what \u2014 I think Obamacare is an unfair name for this thing.\nMr. President, if you liked your apology, you can keep it, all right?"}
