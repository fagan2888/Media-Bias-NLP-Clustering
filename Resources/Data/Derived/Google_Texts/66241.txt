Researchers also found that one-quarter of SMBs are using mobiles for work at least once each hour and that three-quarters (78%) are using mobiles while also using their computer. SMB owners are using mobiles to check texts and emails, but also to schedule appointments, talk/text with customers (56%) and creating to-do lists (30%) or banking (24%).

"Mobile technology is clearly changing the nature of small business ownership," said John Swanciger, CEO of Manta. "It's encouraging to see that small business owners are adapting and taking these seismic shifts in stride. At Manta, we're constantly evolving to support our community, developing mobile-optimized tools to help them succeed and offering resources to demystify the latest trends and technology to insure small businesses keep their competitive edge."

Other interesting findings from the Manta survey include:

• 71% say business has been good so far in 2015, 82% expect the rest of the year to be good

• 78% of SMBs are using mobiles to check in with work while on vacation, 64% say this allows them to enjoy vacations more

• 90% say the new marriage equality law will not change their business

• 13% say they'll begin offering health care to employees because of the Supreme Court stance on the Affordable Care Act; 55% already offered health care

As for the EMV switchover in October, about 28% of SMBs report they still don't know what EMV is or how it will affect their business and 16% say not enough of their customers will use the cards and so it doesn't make transitioning to the new operating systems worthwhile.
