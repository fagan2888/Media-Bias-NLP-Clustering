Today former U.S. president George H.W. Bush celebrates his 90th birthday.

He is known for his funky sock collection, but there’s much more to the former president than crazy footwear.

He doesn’t like broccoli. “I do not like broccoli,” the President said in response to questions about his “broccoli ban” aboard Air Force One, “And I haven’t liked it since I was a little kid and my mother made me eat it. And I’m President of the United States, and I’m not going to eat any more broccoli!”
