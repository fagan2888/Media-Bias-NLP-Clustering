Authorities say a 60-year-old man was killed in a ski accident at Telluride.

San Miguel County Sheriff Bill Masters tells the Telluride Daily Planet that Scott Harlow of Norwood was skiing down Pick `N Gad on Wednesday afternoon when he left the intermediate run and struck a tree.

Ski patrollers at the resort have completed their investigation and will turn the records over to the sheriff's department.

Masters believes Harlow was a fairly accomplished skier, but he was not wearing a helmet. There is no indication the man suffered some kind of medical problem before the crash.
