Bob Marley’s family is launching a marijuana brand in honor of the late reggae icon that is being hailed as the first recreational cannabis brand in the industry.

Marley Natural is set to hit the global market at the end of next year with marijuana accessories and loosely packed “heirloom Jamaican cannabis,” inspired by one of Marley’s favorite strains, NBC’s “Today” reported.

The Marley family and Seattle-based private equity firm Privateer Holdings announced the creation of Marley Natural Tuesday on the “Today” show.

“It just seems natural that Daddy should be part of this conversation,” said Marley’s eldest daughter, Cedella Marley, 47. “As Daddy would say, ‘make way for the positive day.’ “

“Herb is for the healing of the nation; herb is for the meditation; herb is for the higher vibrations,” added Marley’s son, Rohan Marley, 42, who joined his mother and sister in a taped statement to the NBC.

Marijuana, while still federally illegal, is riding a tidal wave of reform. On Nov. 4, residents in Oregon and Alaska voted to follow Colorado and Washington in allowing the recreational use of marijuana. In 2016, at least six more states are expected to consider legalization, NBC reported.

“This is what the end of prohibition looks like,” Privateer Holdings CEO Brendan Kennedy said. “Bob Marley started to push for legalization more than 50 years ago. We’re going to help him finish it.”

Marley said he burned through about a pound of marijuana a week before his death from melanoma in 1981. He considered pot use as a way to expand the senses and get closer to God.

When High Times asked whether the U.S. government would legalize marijuana, Marley once said, “I don’t know if this government will, but I know Christ’s government will,” NBC reported.
