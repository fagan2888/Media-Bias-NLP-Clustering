The tip glowed red as he inhaled.\n\nBut the pen contained no nicotine. Instead, it held 250 milligrams of cannabis oil loaded with THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana.\n\n\u201cNobody noticed,\u201d said Sadis, who owns several marijuana dispensaries in Washington state. \u201cYou pull it out of your pocket, take a hit like a cigarette, put it back, and you\u2019re done. It\u2019s so discreet.\u201d\n\nThe device, called a JuJu Joint, heralds a union that seems all but inevitable: marijuana and the e-cigarette, together at last in an e-joint. For years, people have been stuffing marijuana in various forms into portable vaporizers and into the cartridges of e-cigarettes. But the JuJu Joint is disposable, requires no charging of batteries or loading of cartridges, and comes filled with 150 hits.\n\nYou take it out of the package and put it to your lips \u2014 that\u2019s it. There is no smoke and no smell.\n\nSince their introduction in April, 75,000 JuJu Joints have been sold in Washington state, where marijuana is recreationally and medically legal.\n\nThe maker says that 500,000 will be sold this year and that there are plans to expand to Colorado and Oregon, where recreational use is legal, and to Nevada, where it is decriminalized.\n\n\u201cI wanted to eliminate every hassle that has to do with smoking marijuana,\u201d said Rick Stevens, 62, the inventor and cofounder of JuJu Joints with Marcus Charles, a Seattle entrepreneur. \u201cI wanted it to be discreet and easy for people to handle. There\u2019s no odor, matches or mess.\u201d\n\nNot everyone is so enthusiastic. Many addiction researchers fear that e-cigarettes will pave the way to reliance on actual cigarettes, especially in teenagers. And THC adversely affects the developing brain, some studies have found, impairing attention and memory in adolescents and exacerbating psychiatric problems.\n\n\u201cIn some ways, e-joints are a perfect storm of a problematic delivery system, the e-cigarette, and in addition a problematic substance, cannabis oil,\u201d said Dr. Petros Levounis, the chairman of the psychiatry department at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School.\n\nEach JuJu Joint contains 100 milligrams of THC, twice as much as a traditional joint, as well as propylene glycol, a chemical normally used to absorb water in foods and cosmetics, said Suchitra Krishnan-Sarin, an associate professor of psychiatry at Yale University School of Medicine.\n\n\u201cWe do not know the effects of inhaling constant doses of this agent,\u201d she said. \u201cWe know very little about these products and what they contain.\u201d\n\nStevens, a former marketing executive who spent 30 years in the tobacco industry, defended the device\u2019s THC content, pointing out that each inhalation is metered by the device.\n\n\u201cOur goal is not to get people stoned so they sit in the corner and vegetate,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2015/01/hfjoint20.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd21fb\"", "article_summary": "But the JuJu Joint is disposable, requires no charging of batteries or loading of cartridges, and comes filled with 150 hits.\nIt\u2019s so discreet.\u201dThe device, called a JuJu Joint, heralds a union that seems all but inevitable: marijuana and the e-cigarette, together at last in an e-joint.\nSince their introduction in April, 75,000 JuJu Joints have been sold in Washington state, where marijuana is recreationally and medically legal.\n\u201cNobody noticed,\u201d said Sadis, who owns several marijuana dispensaries in Washington state.\nInstead, it held 250 milligrams of cannabis oil loaded with THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana."}
