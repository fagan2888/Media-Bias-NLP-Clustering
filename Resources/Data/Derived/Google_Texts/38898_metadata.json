Could it be six months? When am I going back to 28 hours a week?\" he said.Frund said that his plan is to save as much money as he can \"in case this happens again.\"", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Obamacare,hours,cut,Blake Frund,Illinois", "pubdate": "2014-02-27T13:49:49", "og": {"site_name": "Newsmax", "description": "Illinois police officers are among the latest Obamacare victims, who had their hours reduced so cities wouldn't have to provide health insurance to part-time employees.", "title": "Obamacare Takes Toll on Illinois Police Department", "url": "http://www.newsmax.com/US/Obamacare-hours-cut-Blake-Frund/2014/02/27/id/555163/", "type": "article", "image": "http://www.newsmax.com/App_Themes/Newsmax/images/facebook/newsmaxFBLogo.gif", "page_id": 85452072376}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.newsmax.com/US/Obamacare-hours-cut-Blake-Frund/2014/02/27/id/555163/", "title": "Obamacare Takes Toll on Illinois Police Department", "description": "Illinois police officers are among the latest Obamacare victims, who had their hours reduced so cities wouldn't have to provide health insurance to part-time employees.", "site": "Newsmax"}, "fb": {"admins": 100002083767056, "app_id": 323020797885219}, "msvalidate.01": "FAF1322EC761685A5DD9344A1C19E82A", "epoch": 1393508989, "google-site-verification": "Jt2HUKgzJJw9VwIQJv31ETytuvNNm5ypTWN6j0nYvHM", "keywords": "Obamacare,hours,cut,Blake Frund,Illinois", "article": {"section": "US", "published_time": "2014-02-27T13:49:49"}, "original-source": "http://www.newsmax.com/US/Obamacare-hours-cut-Blake-Frund/2014/02/27/id/555163/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "description": "Illinois police officers are among the latest Obamacare victims, who had their hours reduced so cities wouldn't have to provide health insurance to part-time employees."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc4f4\"", "article_summary": "he said.Frund said that his plan is to save as much money as he can \"in case this happens again.\"\nWhen am I going back to 28 hours a week?\"\n\"Why do we need Obamacare?\"\n\"It relieved me, but OK, is it another year?\nCould it be six months?"}
