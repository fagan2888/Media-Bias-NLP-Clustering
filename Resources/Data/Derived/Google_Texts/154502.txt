A 20-year-old man on a rafting trip drowned in Clear Creek shortly after noon Saturday. His name has not been released.

The Clear Creek County Sheriff’s Department said the river trip was run by Mile-Hi Rafting. The man was pulled from the river about a mile from the western edge of Clear Creek Canyon along U.S. 6.

Emergency workers could not revive him. The drowning was characterized as accidental Saturday, but an autopsy is planned and the Clear Creek County coroner and sheriff’s deputies are investigating.

The U.S. Geological Survey said Clear Creek was running at 303 cubic feet per second Saturday afternoon, which is 130 percent of its normal median flow.
