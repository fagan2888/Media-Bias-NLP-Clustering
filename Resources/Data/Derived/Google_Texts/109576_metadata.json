In the past year alone, a cancer patient has received a 3D-printed rib cage, the Food and Drug Administration approved the first-ever 3D-printed epilepsy drug, and a baby still in the womb had its head 3D-printed to facilitate a smoother, safer delivery. Soon, we may even be able to regenerate nerves, thanks to a 3D-printed guide containing chemicals capable of stimulating nerve growth.\n\nAll of these 3D printing stories have one thing in common: They were all created inside of a lab, where teams of researchers, most of whom hold advanced degrees, worked with 3D printers worth thousands of dollars. In addition to these advanced labs, there are other labs where students, still working on their degrees, are working to revolutionize health care through affordable 3D-printed medical devices. Stony Brook University\u2019s Innovation Lab in Stony Brook, N.Y., is one of these labs.\n\nMedical Daily had the opportunity to visit the Innovation Lab, where students were creating more than just bookends and miniature replicas of their professors, known as busts. Instead, they were creating prosthetics that could help children without hands and sound amplifiers that would cost thousands of dollars less than those currently on the market. These devices were created with donated 3D printers during students\u2019 free time, with materials purchased at a local craft shop.\n\n3D-printed tech wasn\u2019t all the Innovation Lab had, however. Using the same computer that would allow for mind-controlled 3D-printed prostheses, the students also demonstrated a mind-controlled drone, which we got to see in flight.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "inside, stony, brook, universitys, innovation, lab, where, 3d, printers, are, creating, medical", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Stony Brook University's Innovation Lab lets students use 3D printers to create anything they can imagine and more.", "title": "A 3D Printing Lab Where Prostheses Are Made And Mind-Controlled Drones Fly", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/inside-stony-brook-universitys-innovation-lab-where-3d-printers-are-creating-365160", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2016/05/03/3d-printed-cube.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Stony Brook University's Innovation Lab lets students use 3D printers to create anything they can imagine and more.", "title": "A 3D Printing Lab Where Prostheses Are Made And Mind-Controlled Drones Fly", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/inside-stony-brook-universitys-innovation-lab-where-3d-printers-are-creating-365160", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2016/05/03/3d-printed-cube.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/05/03/3d-printed-cube.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Innovation", "published_time": "2015-12-14T11:18:23-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-03T15:56:29-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Stony Brook University's Innovation Lab lets students use 3D printers to create anything they can imagine and more."}, "article_summary": "Stony Brook University\u2019s Innovation Lab in Stony Brook, N.Y., is one of these labs.\nThese devices were created with donated 3D printers during students\u2019 free time, with materials purchased at a local craft shop.\n3D printing has made huge waves in the health and wellness space of late.\nMedical Daily had the opportunity to visit the Innovation Lab, where students were creating more than just bookends and miniature replicas of their professors, known as busts.\n3D-printed tech wasn\u2019t all the Innovation Lab had, however."}
