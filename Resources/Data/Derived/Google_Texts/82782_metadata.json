This page will be updated throughout the year. See the full list of 2014 midterm election contests the ABC News political team is tracking.\n\nTHE PLAYERS\n\nRep. Carol Shea-Porter\n\nDemocrat\n\nRepresented the district for three terms, only two of which were consecutive: 2007-2011 and 2013-present.\n\nAge: 61 (born 1952)\n\nFormer Rep. Frank Guinta\n\nRepublican\n\nUnseated Shea-Porter and represented the district for one term, 2011-2013. Served as mayor of Manchester, 2006-2010.\n\nAge: 43 (born: Sept. 26, 1970)\n\nDan Innis\n\nRepublican\n\nProfessor of marketing at the University of New Hampshire, served as dean of UNH\u2019s business school from 2007-2013.\n\nAge: 51 (born: April 7, 1963)\n\nTHE STAKES\n\nThe waves keep crashing into New Hampshire\u2019s 1st Congressional District. In 2006, Shea-Porter joined the Democrats\u2019 midterm wave as they took House and Senate majorities on the unpopularity of Bush\u2019s Iraq war and GOP ethics scandals. In 2008, she defended that seat as Obama\u2019s candidacy turned out Democrats nationwide. Like many of her Democratic colleagues, she lost in 2010 to a Republican challenger, Guinta. This time around, the issue looks like Obamacare and how Democrats will answer for its bungled implementation. While Guinta is expected to win the GOP primary, setting up a third-in-a-row matchup between a former and current member of Congress, it could be interesting. Giunta is a social conservative facing an openly gay opponent in a state where gay marriage is legally recognized--including the marriage of Republican business professor and former University of New Hampshire business-school dean Dan Innis, the underdog vying against Guinta for the GOP\u2019s nomination in this race. Their primary is late, and Innis could gain fundraising traction among gay Republicans nationally.\n\nTHE OUTLOOK\n\nShea-Porter leads by double digits, according to an Oct. 7-16, 2013 poll by the University of New Hampshire Survey Center which showed her besting Guinta 48 percent to 32 percent and Innis 43 percent to 32 percent. Shea-Porter could get meaningful help from the DCCC, as she\u2019s a member of its Frontline program. Two extraneous factors could play in this race: 1) Attack ads against Democratic Rep. Ann Kuster (who may or may not have known what \u201cBenghazi\u201d was when asked at a Middle East forum) from the neighboring district will be seen in NH-1, which might not matter but won\u2019t look great for Democrats, and 2) Scott Brown might run for Senate, sucking some of the air out of political discussion across the state.\n\nABC NEWS RATING\n\nToss-up\n\nKEY DATES\n\nSeptmeber 2, 2014: Primary Debate (on ABC affiliate WMUR\n\nSeptember 9, 2014: Party primaries\n\nOctober 27, 2014: Debate (on ABC affiliate WMUR\n\nNovember 4, 2014: General election", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "New Hampshire's 1st Congressional District Race 2014", "description": "New Hampshire's 1st Congressional District Race 2014", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 ABC News Internet Ventures", "author": "ABC News", "og": {"site_name": "ABC News", "description": "New Hampshire's 1st Congressional District Race 2014", "title": "New Hampshire's 1st Congressional District Race 2014", "url": "http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/hampshires-1st-congressional-district-race-2014-abc-news/story?id=22336142", "image": "http://a.abcnews.go.com/images/Politics/GTY_AP_Guinta_Innis_Shea_Porter_ml_140124_16x9_992.jpg", "type": "article"}, "Date": "2014-06-02", "twitter": {"description": "New Hampshire's 1st Congressional District Race 2014", "title": "New Hampshire's 1st Congressional District Race 2014", "url": "http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/hampshires-1st-congressional-district-race-2014-abc-news/story?id=22336142", "image": "http://a.abcnews.go.com/images/Politics/GTY_AP_Guinta_Innis_Shea_Porter_ml_140124_4x3t_240.jpg", "creator": "@c_good", "site": "@ABC", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "abcnewsipad://link/story,22336142", "iphone": "abcnewsiphone://link/story,22336142", "googleplay": "android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Politics/hampshires-1st-congressional-district-race-2014-abc-news/story?id=22336142"}, "name": {"ipad": "ABC News", "iphone": "ABC News", "googleplay": "ABC News"}, "id": {"ipad": 306934135, "iphone": 300255638, "googleplay": "com.abc.abcnews"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "index, follow", "DC.date.issued": "2014-06-02", "al": {"ipad": {"url": "abcnewsipad://link/story,22336142", "app_store_id": 380520716, "app_name": "ABC News for iPad"}, "web": {"url": "http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/hampshires-1st-congressional-district-race-2014-abc-news/story?id=22336142"}, "android": {"url": "android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Politics/hampshires-1st-congressional-district-race-2014-abc-news/story?id=22336142", "app_name": "ABC News Breaking Latest News", "package": "com.abc.abcnews"}, "iphone": {"url": "abcnewsiphone://link/story,22336142", "app_store_id": 300255638, "app_name": "ABC News - Breaking US & World News"}}, "Last-Modified": "2014-06-02 14:35:38", "fb": {"admins": 704409894, "app_id": 4942312939}, "keywords": "carol shea-porter, carol shea porter, new hampshire house race, new hampshire congressional race, frank guinta, shea porter, dan innis, politics news, election news, political news, political news articles", "article": {"author": "/author/chris_good"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "carol shea-porter, carol shea porter, new hampshire house race, new hampshire congressional race, frank guinta, shea porter, dan innis"}, "article_summary": "ABC News' \"14 For 14\" project is documenting 14 races that matter between now and November.\nAge: 51 (born: April 7, 1963)THE STAKESThe waves keep crashing into New Hampshire\u2019s 1st Congressional District.\nABC NEWS RATINGToss-upKEY DATESSeptmeber 2, 2014: Primary Debate (on ABC affiliate WMURSeptember 9, 2014: Party primariesOctober 27, 2014: Debate (on ABC affiliate WMURNovember 4, 2014: General election\nAge: 61 (born 1952)Former Rep.
