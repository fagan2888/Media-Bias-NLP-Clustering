Small businesses and Affordable Care Active Solutions Group drops company insurance plan after messy ACA launch

Once Frank Kadaf, president of Active Solutions Group Inc., lost the ability to hold onto his company's health care plan, he and his employees scrambled to find other options.



The insurer dropped the company's group policy once the Affordable Care Act went into effect on Jan. 1, 2014.



"It was kind of a mess," Kadaf said. "It put us at a disadvantage that we had to cancel what we had in place, and myself and other employees had to make other arrangements."



Active Solutions has 11 employees. The Dearborn-based company reached $1.15 million in revenue last year and is expected to exceed $1.32 million this year. The company is a supplier of voice-over-Internet phone services.



Kadaf was paying about $1,700 per month for his company's group policy before it was canceled. Comparable plans now cost about 20 percent more.
