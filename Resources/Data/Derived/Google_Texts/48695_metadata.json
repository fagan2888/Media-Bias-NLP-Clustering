More than 10,000 children have been through the Art Room program since it started.\n\nIn a study published in the journal The Arts in Psychotherapy, researchers found that children emerged from the 10-week Art Room program with less depression, fewer behavioral problems and improved self esteem.\n\nThe Art Room provides a caring and creative environment through which children can \u201clearn and achieve through art,\u201d said Melissa Cortina, a consultant research psychologist with The Art Room, which is based in Oxford, England.\n\n\u201cIt works closely with schools to support children within the school environment and help them find creative ways to bolster their self-esteem,\u201d Cortina told Reuters Health. \u201cIt works with children and young people who are having serious difficulties and may be at risk of exclusion from mainstream school.\u201d\n\nThe Art Room works with the children on social skills, education as well as therapy, and practitioners are trained with a unique methodology, Cortina told Reuters Health. The goal of the program is ultimately to help children and young people re-engage with education.\n\n\u201cOnce they realize they can achieve success in The Art Room, they can take this new-found confidence back into their schools and daily lives,\u201d she said in an email.\n\nFor the new study, Cortina and colleague Mina Fazel of Oxford University analyzed questionnaires filled out by 169 students in the program and their teachers before and after the 2012-2013 school year. Overall that year, more than 1,000 kids from 13 feeder schools attended The Art Room.\n\nBased on teacher responses, students improved in all areas. There was a 37 percent reduction in a topic called Total Difficulties, a 41 percent reduction in emotional problems, a 15 percent reduction in conduct problems, a 33 percent reduction in hyperactivity, a 41 percent reduction in problems with classmates and a 24 percent improvement in social behavior.\n\nOn the children\u2019s part, there was a notable drop in depression symptoms. Before the program, 16 students (22 percent) had been classified as depressed. After the program, less than 4 percent qualified as depressed.\n\nDebra Linesch, a professor of Marital and Family Therapy at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles, California, said that while this particular program is not available in the U.S., there are others that use art therapy in schools.\n\n\u201cThere are many places where art therapists work in schools and engage children in emotionally and academically enhancing ways that look more like the model discussed in this study than traditional psychotherapy groups,\u201d Linesch said.\n\nThe Art Room intervention is not something that parents can easily duplicate at home, Cortina said, because it needs to be done in a more structured environment with a trained instructor. It also can provide a sense of belonging at school that is different from what can be provided in the home environment.\n\nHowever, \u201cit is certainly possible for parents to adopt some of the techniques used in The Art Room for home, such as creating a positive, support environment that promotes creativity,\u201d Cortina said.\n\nWhile the focus now is in schools, Cortina notes that The Art Room (http://www.theartroom.org.uk) has a long-term vision of incorporating families and communities to extend \"the positive effects of the program.\u201d\n\nSOURCE: http://bit.ly/1u7o9ap The Arts in Psychotherapy, online December 22, 2014.\n\n(By Roxanne Nelson)", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "art, therapy, may, help, kids, behavior, problems", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "School-based art therapy in the UK is helping troubled kids get back on track, a new study suggests.", "title": "Art Therapy May Help Kids With Behavior Problems", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/art-therapy-may-help-kids-behavior-problems-318272", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/01/17/art-therapy.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "School-based art therapy in the UK is helping troubled kids get back on track, a new study suggests.", "title": "Art Therapy May Help Kids With Behavior Problems", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/art-therapy-may-help-kids-behavior-problems-318272", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/01/17/art-therapy.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/01/17/art-therapy.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Under the Hood", "published_time": "2015-01-17T11:13:14-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-17T11:13:25-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "School-based art therapy in the UK is helping troubled kids get back on track, a new study suggests."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbcc5\"", "article_summary": "(Reuters Health) - School-based art therapy in the UK is helping troubled kids get back on track, a new study suggests.\nSchool-based art therapy in the UK is helping troubled kids get back on track, a new study suggests.\nMore than 10,000 children have been through the Art Room program since it started.\nThe Art Room provides a caring and creative environment through which children can \u201clearn and achieve through art,\u201d said Melissa Cortina, a consultant research psychologist with The Art Room, which is based in Oxford, England.\nOverall that year, more than 1,000 kids from 13 feeder schools attended The Art Room."}
