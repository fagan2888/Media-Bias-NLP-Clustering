Students work at the center twice, once in their first year and again in their second year.\n\n\u0093Their perspective changes with the more schooling they get,\u0094 Foos said.\n\nServices provided include screenings for blood pressure, glucose and cholesterol, physical and occupational therapy, physical rehabilitation for daily living and nutritional coaching.\n\n\u0093Our patients, it\u0092s kind of unique, they don\u0092t need a doctor\u0092s referral to come here,\u0094 Foos said. \u0093We\u0092re what is called a direct access clinic. So anyone can be seen. They don\u0092t have to go through a doctor, some of our patients don\u0092t have a doctor.\u0094\n\nJudith Paradis, who is in her second semester studying to become a physical therapy assistant, said the program is challenging, but in a good way.\n\n\u0093For me it\u0092s completely helpful,\u0094 she said. \u0093It\u0092s exactly what I need for learning. When you\u0092re sitting in a classroom, you\u0092re just writing on paper. But here, you get to see what you\u0092re learning in action and really get to apply it. So it\u0092s worlds different than the classroom. It\u0092s amazing to apply what you\u0092re learning and see how it affects and helps the patient too.\u0094\n\nThe center also has a collaboration with Cleveland State\u0092s Doctoral Physical Therapy program and works in conjunction with Tri-C\u0092s students in the fall semester.\n\n\u0093They would do the physical therapy evaluations under supervisions and our students would help carry out the plans,\u0094 Foos said.\n\nThe Ohio College of Podiatric Medicine also comes twice a month to provide free foot screenings and in conjunction with Cuyahoga County, Tri-C offers HIV screenings at various times throughout the year.\n\nFoos said physical or occupational therapy evaluations are $10 and $5 for a follow-up visit. Bone density, cholesterol and glucose screenings are $15 total. Blood pressure screenings and nutritional coaching sessions are free.\n\nServices are offered in the fall and spring semester when classes are in session. The Metropolitan Campus\u0092 center is open on Tuesdays between 2 p.m. and 5 p.m. The Eastern Campus\u0092 center is open 2 to 5 p.m. on Thursdays.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "News, Willoughby news, OH news, US news, world news.", "title": "Tri-C offers healthy dose of low-income care, experience at Health, Wellness and Preventative Care Center", "og": {"url": "http://www.news-herald.com/article/HR/20140320/NEWS/140329965", "image": {"width": "600px", "identifier": "http://www.news-herald.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/HR/20140320/NEWS/140329965/AR/0/AR-140329965.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "405px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Tri-C offers healthy dose of low-income care, experience at Health, Wellness and Preventative Care Center"}, "twitter": {"domain": "news-herald.com", "description": "Michael Oatman suffered a stroke in January that left him without feeling in his right hand.As a playwright, writing and typing are important parts of his work but when he fir", "title": "Tri-C offers healthy dose of low-income care, experience at Health, Wellness and Preventative Care Center", "url": "http://www.news-herald.com/article/HR/20140320/NEWS/140329965", "image": {"src": "http://www.news-herald.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/HR/20140320/NEWS/140329965/AR/0/AR-140329965.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@newsheraldinoh", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id563963169", "iphone": "id520206415", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.newsherald"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "News, Willoughby news, OH news, US news, world news.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "Michael Oatman suffered a stroke in January that left him without feeling in his right hand.As a playwright, writing and typing are important parts of his work but when he fir"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf02f\"", "article_summary": "Tri-C\u0092s Health, Wellness and Preventative Care Centers have been providing low-cost health care services to uninsured and underinsured adults since 2009.\nIn addition, the service offers students studying to become medical assistants, physical therapy assistants, occupational therapy assistants and dieticians experience in a clinical settingunder the supervision of licensed health care provides.\n\u0093It\u0092s a little slower now.\u0094Oatman said he recently signed up for health care under the Affordable Care Act, but did not have insurance when he first came to Tri-C for occupational therapy.\nThe Metropolitan Campus\u0092 center is open on Tuesdays between 2 p.m. and 5 p.m.\nServices provided include screenings for blood pressure, glucose and cholesterol, physical and occupational therapy, physical rehabilitation for daily living and nutritional coaching."}
