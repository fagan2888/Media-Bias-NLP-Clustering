Balance-billing occurs when health workers who don\u2019t accept a patient\u2019s insurance try to collect the difference between their charge and the insurer\u2019s reimbursement.\n\nNew York is one of 13 states that have restrictions on out-of-network balance-billing, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Patients most often receive these surprise bills in emergency cases, when they can\u2019t choose the doctors who treat them. In California, a 2007 survey conducted before the state implemented patient protection laws found 1.8 million insured residents who visited emergency rooms over two years faced extra charges, according to the California Health Plan Association.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty good bet that if you\u2019re hospitalized or having any kind of surgery, somebody along the way who touches you or your slides or films will not be in network,\u201d said Karen Pollitz, a senior fellow at the Menlo Park, California-based Kaiser foundation.\n\nNew Yorkers previously were protected only from out-of-network ambulance bills and, for individuals in health maintenance organizations, in the ER. Under the new law, beginning next year all medical providers will have to notify patients before treatment if they don\u2019t take their insurance. If not, patients will be required to pay only a regular co-pay as if the provider was in network.\n\nBroken Leg\n\nBalance-billing happened to Abby Ives, a therapist and clinical social worker from Ossining, New York, when she fell in her front yard on June 24, 2012, and shattered a bone in her right leg.\n\nAs a health-care provider, 61-year-old Ives knew the importance of insurance.\n\n\u201cAs I was laying in the front yard, I told my husband, \u2018Honey, get the insurance card, we\u2019re going to need it,\u2019\u201d she recounted in a telephone interview.\n\nThe ambulance took her to Phelps Memorial Hospital Center in Sleepy Hollow, New York, which was covered by her insurance through Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield. Ives underwent surgery, then X-rays revealed her left leg was also broken, so she had a second surgery. During her monthlong stay in the hospital, she said she wasn\u2019t told that many of the providers treating her weren\u2019t included in her insurance plan.\n\nNot Covered\n\nIves was shocked when, after she was discharged, Empire notified her that both surgeons, the hospitalists who coordinated her care within the hospital and the cardiologists who read her electrocardiograms weren\u2019t part of her coverage plan. One surgeon sent her a bill for $13,000, the hospitalists charged $1,500, and two electrocardiograms were an additional $100 each.\n\n\u201cMy reaction is not printable,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m a provider, I see patients and bill insurance companies, I\u2019m supposed to know how this works, but how did they do that to me?\u201d\n\nTo pay the bills, Ives said she would have to reach into her and her husband\u2019s retirement funds. She appealed to the surgeon\u2019s billing staff repeatedly, she said, before the surgeon agreed to accept the insurance company\u2019s out-of-network reimbursement of $20,000 and stop pursuing Ives for the balance of $13,000.\n\nAs for the hospitalists and cardiologists, \u201cI just paid them,\u201d Ives said. \u201cI wanted to be done, for them to go away.\u201d\n\nOutrageous Bills\n\nWellPoint Inc.\u2019s Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield, Ives\u2019 insurance, supports provisions in the new law that \u201cwill help protect consumers from outrageous, unexpected medical bills,\u201d Sally Kweskin, a spokeswoman, said in an e-mail.\n\nPhelps Memorial spokeswoman Tina Dorfman said in an e-mail that the hospital \u201chas almost 500 physicians on staff, and only a fraction are employed by the hospital. The remaining physicians take various other combinations of insurance plans. Administratively it\u2019s impossible for a hospital to have current information at all times about which insurance plans every physician is accepting.\u201d\n\nThe need to protect consumers like Ives is growing as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, extends insurance to millions of Americans, said Elisabeth Benjamin, vice president of health initiatives at the Community Service Society of New York.\n\n\u2018More Chaos\u2019\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to protect the consumer now, because there\u2019s a little more chaos in the system and a lot more people,\u201d Benjamin said in a phone interview. She said balance-billing is the most-common payment problem seen at her nonprofit advocacy organization, which handled 65,000 health-care cases last year.\n\nNew York\u2019s new law creates an independent arbitration process between providers and insurers, taking patients out of the equation.\n\nSome states, including Maryland, prohibit out-of-network balance-billing for select services. While Colorado doesn\u2019t explicitly ban the practice, the state instructs insurers to \u201chold harmless\u201d the patient and take responsibility for surprise bills. In Texas, providers must disclose their network status.\n\nWhile the Affordable Care Act didn\u2019t address surprise bills, the government has imposed network adequacy requirements that prevent health plans from having too few providers, which may reduce the number of cases where patients find themselves inadvertently out-of-network.\n\n\u2018Monumental Task\u2019\n\nIves counts herself as lucky because the surgeon backed down but, she said, \u201cthe process wasn\u2019t easy and I had to appeal all the way around. It\u2019s completely overwhelming.\u201d\n\nOther patients may not be as fortunate, especially in emergency situations. In some states, ambulance services are out-of-network, notes Cheryl Fish-Parcham, private insurance program director at Families USA, a nonprofit consumer advocacy organization.\n\n\u201cWhen you call the ambulance, you\u2019re thinking about getting to the hospital fast,\u201d said Fish-Parcham in a telephone interview. Network status \u201cis the furthest question from your mind.\u201d\n\nNew York will now require doctors and hospitals to disclose their network status before treatment in non-emergency procedures. Insurers will have to update online provider directories within 15 days of a change.\n\nShifting Responsibility\n\nAndrew Kleinman, president-elect of the Medical Society of the State of New York, says he supports more transparency, but the onus to provide information should be on the insurers.\n\n\u201cA lot of doctors don\u2019t know whether they\u2019re in-network or not,\u201d Kleinman said. The Society surveyed doctors in December and found that almost 40 percent didn\u2019t know how many plans they were participating in on the New York public exchange, he said.\n\nThe American Hospital Association also pointed to the insurers. \u201cSince hospitals deal with more than 1,300 insurers, all with their own policies, insurers are in the best position to provide the information on what a patients\u2019 out of pocket cost will be,\u201d spokeswoman Marie Watteau said in an e-mail.\n\nInsurers, however, are eager to hand responsibility to doctors. Providers should know which contracts they\u2019ve signed, said Leslie Moran, vice president of the New York Health Plan Association, in a telephone interview.\n\n\u201cProbably the best thing is for patients to call their doctor and ask if they\u2019re participating,\u201d she said.\n\nEven when all parties agree that consumers should be well informed, disclosure alone may not be enough protection in emergency cases, says Georgetown University professor Kevin Lucia.\n\nLittle Choice\n\n\u201cWhen someone\u2019s having a heart attack or a baby, you can tell them someone\u2019s not covered, but can they do anything about it?\u201d Lucia said in a telephone interview. \u201cIt still puts the consumer in the awful situation of thinking about insurance when they are supposed to be focused on delivering their baby.\u201d\n\nThis means that providers and payers need to agree on a reimbursement rate in these emergency cases, which isn\u2019t an easy task.\n\nInsurers maintain networks of doctors who are paid at negotiated rates. In-network doctors benefit from promised patient volumes, while insurers typically can get a discounted rate through negotiation. Insurers say that raising out-of-network reimbursement rates would discourage doctors from joining health plans. Providers, meanwhile, don\u2019t want to settle for lower rates.\n\nWide Discrepancy\n\nData from nonprofit health-care transparency organization FAIR Health shows a wide discrepancy in reimbursement rates. For example, the median charge for anesthesia services in Manhattan is $696.67, according to FAIR Health. The charge is more than twice the common Medicare-based formula rate used for out-of-network reimbursements, which is $285.40.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an extremely complex problem,\u201d Dianne Longley, a principal at insurance consulting firm Health Management Associates, said by telephone.\n\nLongley previously worked in the Texas Department of Insurance and oversaw the advisory committee that helped come up with Texas\u2019s patient protection legislation. \u201cPolitically it\u2019s a very precarious position when the state starts mandating medical payment rates\u201d typically are set in private contracts, she said.\n\nStill, Longley encourages lawmakers to persevere. \u201cEveryone agrees it\u2019s a problem for the consumer but unfortunately, without regulation and legislation, the consumer is the one left holding the bag.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Caroline Chen", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-04-04/surprise-medical-bills-lead-to-protection-laws-health", "title": "Surprise Medical Bills Lead to Protection Laws: Health", "description": "Hospital patients in New York are the latest in the nation to gain legal protection against unexpected bills from doctors who won\u2019t accept their insurance.", "card": "summary", "site": "@business"}, "parsely-author": "Caroline Chen", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "Law,California,New York,Health", "news_keywords": "Law,California,New York,Health", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-04-04/surprise-medical-bills-lead-to-protection-laws-health", "parsely-title": "Surprise Medical Bills Lead to Protection Laws: Health", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff0000", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-04-04T04:01:00.010Z", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "Hospital patients in New York are the latest in the nation to gain legal protection against unexpected bills from doctors who won\u2019t accept their insurance.", "parsely-tags": "Law,California,New York,Health,Region: Global,Page: article", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.bwbx.io/business/public/images/favicons/mstile-144x144-bbd2101292.png", "date": "2014-04-04T04:01:00.010Z", "parsely-section": "science-energy", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "og": {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-04-04/surprise-medical-bills-lead-to-protection-laws-health", "type": "website", "site_name": "Bloomberg.com", "description": "Hospital patients in New York are the latest in the nation to gain legal protection against unexpected bills from doctors who won\u2019t accept their insurance.", "title": "Surprise Medical Bills Lead to Protection Laws: Health"}, "fb": {"status": "Hospital patients in New York are the latest in the nation to gain legal protection against unexpected bills from doctors who won\u2019t accept their insurance."}, "parsely-post-id": "N2MUMQ6JTSFA01", "format-detection": "telephone=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd17fb\"", "article_summary": "Hospital patients in New York are the latest in the nation to gain legal protection against unexpected bills from doctors who won\u2019t accept their insurance.\nNew York this week extended patient protection laws to restrict out-of-network providers from \u201cbalance-billing\u201d consumers for emergency care or when patients can\u2019t choose their doctors.\nNew Yorkers previously were protected only from out-of-network ambulance bills and, for individuals in health maintenance organizations, in the ER.\nBalance-billing occurs when health workers who don\u2019t accept a patient\u2019s insurance try to collect the difference between their charge and the insurer\u2019s reimbursement.\nProviders should know which contracts they\u2019ve signed, said Leslie Moran, vice president of the New York Health Plan Association, in a telephone interview."}
