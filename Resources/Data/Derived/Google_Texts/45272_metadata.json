The memo was both a call to arms and a battle plan for a business response to its growing legion of opponents. Powell was a corporate lawyer, a former president of the American Bar Association, and a board member of eleven corporations, including Philip Morris and the Ethyl Corporation, a company that made the lead for leaded gasoline. Powell had also represented the Tobacco Institute, the research arm of the tobacco industry, and various tobacco companies. Later that year, President Richard Nixon would nominate Powell to sit on the U.S. Supreme Court, where he served for fifteen years.\n\nPowell\u2019s memo serves as a useful starting point for understanding how the transformation of the corporate system that began in the 1970s set the stage for today\u2019s global health problems. \u201cNo thoughtful person can question that the American economic system is under broad attack,\u201d wrote Powell. \u201cThe assault on the enterprise system is broadly based and consistently pursued. It is gaining momentum and converts.\u201d \u201cOne of the bewildering paradoxes of our time,\u201d Powell continued, \u201cis the extent to which the enterprise system tolerates, if not participates in, its own destruction.\u201d He enumerated the system\u2019s enemies: well-meaning liberals, government officials intent on regulating business, news media, student activists, and an emerging environmental and consumer movement\u2014 especially its most visible leader, Ralph Nader, in Powell\u2019s view \u201cthe single most effective antagonist of American business.\u201d\n\nPowell called on business, especially the Chamber of Commerce, to end its \u201cappeasement\u201d of its critics and launch an aggressive and systematic counter-assault. The memo warned that \u201cindependent and uncoordinated activity by individual corporations, as important as this is, will not be sufficient. Strength lies in organization, in careful long-range planning and implementation, in consistency of action over an indefinite period of years . . . and in the political power available only though united action and national organizations.\u201d\n\nPowell urged new, well-funded public media campaigns to support the free enterprise system, the creation of think tanks and institutes to develop policy proposals and \u201cdirect political action\u201d in legislative and judicial arenas. \u201cIt is time,\u201d he argued, for \u201cAmerican business . . . to apply their great talents vigorously to the preservation of the system itself.\u201d Powell\u2019s \u201cconfidential\u201d memo was first circulated within the Chamber of Commerce, then released in 1972 by investigative reporter Jack Anderson during the Powell Supreme Court confirmation hearings. While the document may not have been the blueprint for the rise of the Republican right that some analysts claim, its real value is as the articulation of the corporate prescription for capitalism\u2019s ills.\n\nToday, more than forty years after business took up Powell\u2019s appeal, its success in achieving the goals he laid out makes it hard to fathom the depth of his concern. But the early 1970s were a high point for several public-interest movements that personified and amplified a growing opposition to business dominance. In addition, the recent victories of the civil rights and antiwar movements, coupled with the emergence of the women\u2019s and environmental movements, meant change was in the air. Millions of Americans had shown their willingness to protest, demonstrate, and oppose corporate consumerism, so corporate leaders were understandably worried about their future.\n\nThese fears were amplified by legislative action. Between 1960 and 1980, under three Democratic and two Republican presidents, Congress passed an astonishing forty-nine laws that gave consumers, workers, and the environment new protection. These new laws, and the agencies that implemented them, governed the practices of the auto, alcohol, firearms, food, pharmaceutical, and tobacco industries, discussed previously, as well as every other industry in America. While each law had limitations, and many were inadequately enforced, together they constituted a sea change in government and corporate relations and signaled the willingness of both Republicans and Democrats to expand the rights and protections of consumers. After 1980, new regulations were of course still promulgated, but at a much slower pace, and many of the new laws limited or rolled back those passed in the previous two decades.\n\nNew organizations, such as Common Cause and Friends of the Earth, emerged to bring middle-class opposition to harmful business practices to Washington. Ralph Nader, Powell\u2019s nemesis, founded a myriad of groups, including the Center for Auto Safety, the Corporate Accountability Project, the Center for Responsive Law, and the Public Citizen Litigation Group\u2014all to create what Mark Green, a Nader prote\u0301ge\u0301, called \u201ca government in exile\u201d that \u201cwaged a crusade against official malfeasance, consumer fraud and environmental degradation.\u201d Nader\u2019s 1965 book, Unsafe at Any Speed, an expose\u0301 of the auto industry, and Rachel Carson\u2019s 1962 Silent Spring, a critique of pesticide use, alerted millions of Americans to the harmful health consequences of certain corporate practices.\n\nPowell\u2019s memo emphasized the domestic threats to corporate America, but abroad, even more pervasive challenges to United States\u2013based corporate control were emerging. First, following the devastation of World War II, Japan and Germany had rebuilt their economies. Between 1950 and 1980, real annual per capita growth in gross national product went up by 7.4 percent in Japan and 4.9 percent in West Germany\u2014but only by 2 percent in the United States.8 Fueled by this rapid growth, Japanese, German, and other European corporations began to compete with U.S. companies for global markets and profits. In the auto industry, for example, in 1953, the United States made 70 percent of the world\u2019s motor vehicles; by 1968, this share was down to 38 percent.\n\nOver the next four decades, the increasing globalization of multinational corporations forced U.S. companies to develop new strategies for increasing profits. This globalization of capital also changed how U.S. companies interacted with the U.S. government, ultimately diminishing government influence on companies. By 2008, shortly before the start of the economic crisis, Business Week observed that, \u201cin effect, U.S. multinationals have been decoupling from the U.S. economy in the last decade. They still have their headquarters in America, they\u2019re still listed on U.S. stock exchanges and most of their shareholders are still American. But their expansion has been mainly overseas.\u201d As economic pressures forced corporate managers to let go of patriotism that may have motivated earlier decisions, their concern for the well-being of the American people and its economy declined.\n\nThe early 1970s also brought the first of several energy crises, precipitated by declines in energy production in the United States and by the growing power of oil-producing states to set energy prices. Rising oil prices contributed to a global economic downturn, ending two decades of American prosperity during which U.S. national income had nearly doubled and the size of the middle class had expanded significantly. A stock market crash in 1973\u20131974 further contributed to a global economic downturn, alarming investors and corporate owners.\n\nIt was in response to these national and international threats that corporate America devised a new game plan, designed to restore corporations\u2019 ability to advance their political and economic agendas. No single individual or organization had the power to shape this response, but Powell\u2019s memo clearly laid out a comprehensive agenda that could mobilize American business to take on its challengers.\n\nCorporations\u2019 rise to dominance: From the early years to the 1970s and 1980s\n\nResponding to changing economic and political conditions was nothing new for corporations; they had long been an essential component of American society and had learned how to adapt to modifications in the political climate. Corporations were first created in the late seventeenth century in Holland, Great Britain, and elsewhere to mobilize capital for public development projects such as railroads or shipping canals that were too big for individual investors, and for colonization. In the mid\u2013nineteenth century, they played an important role in creating the infrastructures for American industrialization, and by the late nineteenth century, they had become central players in the American economy. Later, through federal legislation, they received additional legal protections such as limited liability, constitutional protections, and extended lifespan. By the end of the twentieth century, most observers across the political spectrum agreed that corporations dominated the global economy and served as the principal agents for modern capitalism.\n\nIn some periods, corporations and their allies were more successful in achieving their business and political objectives than others. In the 1880s, for example, the \u201crobber barons\u201d\u2014the corporate leaders of the steel, oil, and railroad industries\u2014were able to win new government protection for trusts; and in the 1920s, prior to the Great Depression, business persuaded the federal government to keep taxes low, tariffs high, and regulation weak. At other times, popular movements won important victories from business, including the creation of the Food and Drug Administration in 1906, the right for workers to organize labor unions, and, during the New Deal, the creation of new regulatory agencies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Communications Commission. In 1936, campaigning for reelection, Franklin D. Roosevelt articulated this populist theme, \u201cWe now know that government by organized money is just as dangerous as government by organized mob.\u201d Even in these more populist moments, however, corporate leaders were able to play major roles in structuring reforms and government regulations to ensure that their long-term interests were not sacrificed.\n\nOn one hand, the orchestrated corporate response to the domestic and global political and economic crises of the 1970s was simply corporations taking care of business as usual. Different were the concurrent changes in the economy, technology, and politics, which gave corporations powerful new tools to bring to their counter-offensive. New discoveries in information and communications such as computers, mobile phones, and later the Internet, made it easier to plan and coordinate national and global campaigns and to move capital and production around the world. Air transport and containerized shipping created the conditions for global consumer markets. Professions such as public relations, advertising, and lobbying developed sophisticated new techniques that enabled corporations to mobilize support for their economic and political goals.\n\nAt the same time, many of the countervailing powers that had in earlier times challenged corporate advances were in decline. Changes in family structure and job opportunities allowed corporations to take over what had been family responsibilities: McDonald\u2019s replaced Mom\u2019s cooking, TV became the new baby sitter, and Hollywood and Madison Avenue taught children about food, shopping, sex, and relationships.\n\nOther institutions also lost influence to corporations. Patients learned about new drugs from advertisements rather than from their family doctor or local pharmacist. Churches and faith organizations, which had been an arena for social interactions, and sometimes offered critiques of unrestrained markets, lost parishioners to the mall, or decided to endorse wealth as the new virtue. Labor unions declined in membership and political influence. In the mid-1950s, more than a third of U.S. private sector workers belonged to labor unions; by 2005 this had declined to less than 10 percent. Political parties, in the past a limited avenue for popular participation in politics, became increasingly professionalized and subject to the influence of wealthy campaign contributors and lobbyists.\n\nThe mass media, at times a powerful critic of corporate excess, also came under the control of big business. Large media conglomerates such as Disney, National Amusements, Time Warner, Viacom, News Corp., Bertelsmann AG, Sony, and General Electric took over television, radio, book publishing, movies, music, and other media and often shared directors or owners with other companies, reducing any impetus for journalistic investigations of harmful corporate practices. Later, the Internet, increasingly dominated by big corporations and advertisers, replaced more intimate and face-to-face forms of communication.\n\nTogether, these changes helped clear the playing field for the amplified corporate voice that Lewis Powell had urged in his memo. As the public-interest movements that had alarmed Powell and his allies waned in the late 1970s and especially after the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980, big business again became the dominant voice in social and economic policy and politics, as it had been in the 1880s and 1920s.\n\nIn the short term, the Powell memo and the point of view it represented led to rapid changes. The Chamber of Commerce soon \u201cdoubled its membership, tripled its budget and stepped up its lobbying efforts\u201d in Washington, where it became the dominant corporate voice. In 1971, the National Association of Manufacturers, the voice of corporate producers, moved from Cincinnati to Washington, D.C., where it, too, played a growing role in public policy. In 1971, 175 companies had registered lobbyists in the capital; by 1982, the number had increased to almost 2,500. Between 1976 and the mid-1980s, the number of corporate political action committees (PACs) increased from 300 to more than 1,200.\n\nSeveral new business-friendly think tanks were established, including the Heritage Foundation and the Cato Institute, and during the 1970s, the American Enterprise Institute, another Washington-based business-friendly organization, increased its staff from ten to 125 and its budget from $1 million to $8 million. Business leaders also created more activist organizations designed expressly to change policy, including the Business Roundtable and the American Legislative Exchange Council. As journalist Bill Moyers wrote in 2011, these responses to Powell\u2019s call \u201ctriggered an economic transformation that would in time touch every aspect of our lives.\u201d\n\nHow economic change led to changes in health\n\nFrom their inception, the primary objective of corporations was to make money for their investors. Until the changes that began in the 1970s, however, social, political, and economic factors constrained corporations and limited their impact on people\u2019s day-to-day lives outside the factory gates. Several key developments set the stage for this transformation.\n\nShort-termism: \u201cShort-termism\u201d describes the emphasis on investors\u2019 getting a return on investment quickly\u2014in a few quarters or years rather than in decades. As capital became more mobile and companies extended their global reach, investors had more opportunities to look for higher rates of return. \u201cShareholder value\u201d became the new mantra for corporate managers, and executives who failed to meet earnings goals had their salaries docked or lost their jobs. Managers were forced to focus on cost-cutting, quarterly returns, and short-term quick fixes to boost revenues. For the corporation itself, too many disappointing quarters led to a loss of investors and fears of takeover.\n\nIn an oft-quoted 1981 speech, General Electric CEO Jack Welch laid out the principles. The questions companies need to ask during what he called \u201cslow growth\u201d periods, he told financial analysts meeting at the Pierre Hotel in New York City, were \u201chow big and how fast\u201d a company could grow. \u201cManagement and companies that hang on to losers for whatever reason, tradition, sentiment, their own management weaknesses, won\u2019t be around in 1990.\u201d \u201cNeutron Jack\u201d practiced what he preached: each year he fired the managers with the lowest returns, ensuring a sharp focus on the bottom line. This focus often had an impact on health: the Big Three auto companies chose to invest heavily in polluting SUVs because these vehicles produced windfall profits that kept investors happy\u2014 even as they contributed to the longer term decline of the auto industry. In this environment, concerns about the long-term safety of new products or the sustainability of a production practice inevitably lost precedence to profitability.\n\nFinancialization: \u201cFinancialization\u201d has been defined as a \u201cpattern of accumulation in which profit making occurs increasingly through financial channels rather than through trade and commodity production.\u201d As investor demand for profit increased, the returns on investments in mortgages, derivatives, or commodities futures were higher than for those in industries that produced goods or services. This increased the demand for short-term results in the traditional industries and contributed to rapid acquisition and selling of companies. Increased use of leveraged buyouts, junk bonds, and hedge funds were among the consequences of the increasing financialization of corporate America. Between 1990 and 2010, the financial sector\u2019s share of total corporate profits doubled in the United States, reaching as high as 44 per cent in 2002. The fast growth and high profits in this sector exacerbated the pressure on consumer corporations to match these returns or risk losing capital to these more promising investments. Over time, companies that made products to sell to consumers lost ground to companies that bought and sold risk, depending on these new financial firms for investment and loans. Maximizing shareholder value often trumped holding on to long-term customers, leading to more volatile markets and ever more urgent quests for blockbuster products that would please investors even if they harmed consumers.\n\nThe story of the leveraged buyout of RJR Nabisco, a leading tobacco and food company, told by Bryan Burrough and John Helyar in their book Barbarians at the Gate, shows how companies became more concerned with making deals than with making products. In 1988, Henry Kravis, one of the originators and a master of leveraged buyouts, took on RJR Nabisco CEO Ross Johnson in a battle for control of the corporation that had made its fortune from selling tobacco (Camel and Winston), alcohol (Heublein Spirits, maker of Smirnoff vodka and Don Q Rum) and processed food (Oreos and Mallomars). The drama featured a cast of more than a dozen other leading companies, banks, and law firms: Shearson Lehman Hutton, American Express, Dillon Read, Drexel Burnham Lambert, The First Boston Group, Forstman Little, Goldman Sachs, Lazard Fre\u0300res, Morgan Stanley, Salomon Brothers, Skadden Arps, and Wasserstein Perella. In the end, Kravis signed a $31.4 billion deal for one of America\u2019s premier companies\u2014at the time, the highest price ever paid for a corporation.\n\nSince the deal was financed with debt, it heightened the pressure on RJR to produce profits by any means necessary. In the musical-chairs game leading up to the deal, businesses involved in the negotiations included corporate giants such as Kellogg\u2019s, Pepsi, Philip Morris, and Pillsbury. During the hostile-takeover boom of the 1980s, nearly one-third of the largest U.S. manufacturers were acquired or merged. If companies were being traded like baseball cards, what executive had to worry about the long-term liability of the company\u2019s products or practices?\n\nDeregulation: \u201cDeregulation\u201d is the dismantling of existing regulations or their lax enforcement. Beginning in the 1970s, businesses argued that government regulations, not changes in the global economy, were a main cause of lower profits, and therefore these regulations should be suspended or \u201creformed.\u201d In his successful 1980 campaign for president, Ronald Reagan promised business audiences that he would \u201cturn you loose again to do the things I know you can do so well,\u201d and delivered on his promise for regulatory relief by withdrawing, relaxing, or not enforcing dozens of regulations, including many of those passed in the previous two decades. One of Reagan\u2019s contributions was to centralize regulatory oversight in the White House. As James Miller, the head of the newly created Vice President\u2019s Task Force on Regulatory Relief (and an alumnus of the business think tank the American Enterprise Institute) put it, by claiming direct oversight, the president \u201cwould not have guerrilla warfare from agencies that don\u2019t want to follow Reagan\u2019s prescription for regulatory relaxation.\u201d In other words, politics, not science, was to inform regulatory decisions.\n\nOne example of this deregulation helps explain the growth of marketing of unhealthy food to children. In 1984, the Federal Communications Commission lifted restrictions on television advertising to children that had been in place since the 1970s, opening the door to a flood of ads for fast food, soda, sweetened cereals, and candy targeting young children. That decade marked the beginning of the dramatic rise in child obesity. After the 2008 financial crisis, corporations renewed their war on regulation, charging that it (not their risky speculation) was preventing a return to economic growth.\n\nTwo other examples show how deregulation can harm health. In 1994, as a result of intense lobbying by vitamin and food supplement makers, the U.S. Congress passed the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA), which limited the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s authority to regulate supplements. Under the new Act, as long as manufacturers made no claims about their products\u2019 treating, preventing, or curing diseases, the FDA had to prove they were harmful rather than the industry having the prior obligation to prove they were safe. Consumer Reports judged that \u201cthe law has left consumers without the protections surrounding the manufacture and marketing of over-the-counter or prescription medication.\u201d Supplement manufacturers were now able to launch products without any testing at all, just by sending the FDA a copy of the language on the label. In 2010, a Government Accountability Office (GAO) report on FDA oversight of dietary supplements found that nearly all of the herbal dietary supplements that the GAO tested contained trace amounts of lead and other contaminants, and 16 of the 40 supplements tested contained pesticide residues that appeared to exceed legal limits. Among the illegal claims that supplementary makers made were that a product containing ginkgo biloba was a treatment for Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and a product containing ginseng could prevent diabetes and cancer. The deregulation instituted by DSHEA endangered the health of consumers and provided misleading and deceptive health education. This further complicated the task of nutrition educators accountable to the public rather than corporations. These educators now needed, not only to give people the facts they needed to make informed food choices, but also to counteract the better funded misinformation campaigns that industry sponsored.\n\nA study of alcohol regulation in the United Kingdom concluded that the deregulation of alcohol marketing that began in the 1960s and continues to the present has significantly increased the health-related harms caused by alcohol. Repealing laws that limited the hours and places of sales, and the pricing and marketing of beer, wine, and liquor contributed to increases in deaths from cirrhosis of the liver, hospital admissions for alcoholic liver disease and acute intoxication, and binge drinking among teenage girls. Compared to the United States, which still has more robust state and local alcohol regulations in place, the United Kingdom has higher rates of alcohol consumption, fewer alcohol abstainers, and a youth and childhood drinking rate more than twice the American rate. In 2013, bowing to pressure from the alcohol industry, the United Kingdom again missed an opportunity to remedy these problems by rejecting a proposal to institute regulations that would have used alcohol pricing to discourage excess use, a decision decried by public health advocates.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The corporate class has accumulated a staggering level of power in Washington \u2014 and we've all paid the price", "title": "McDomination: How corporations conquered America and ruined our health", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The corporate class has accumulated a staggering level of power in Washington \u2014 and we've all paid the price", "title": "McDomination: How corporations conquered America and ruined our health", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/02/23/mcdomination_how_corporations_conquered_america_and_ruined_our_health/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/mcdonalds_arches.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The corporate class has accumulated a staggering level of power in Washington \u2014 and we've all paid the price", "title": "McDomination: How corporations conquered America and ruined our health", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/mcdonalds_arches.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Nicholas Freudenberg", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Books, corporations, Deregulation, Lethal But Legal, McDonalds, public health, Regulation", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcce8d\"", "article_summary": "Between 1976 and the mid-1980s, the number of corporate political action committees (PACs) increased from 300 to more than 1,200.\n\u201cIt is time,\u201d he argued, for \u201cAmerican business .\n\u201cNo thoughtful person can question that the American economic system is under broad attack,\u201d wrote Powell.\nA stock market crash in 1973\u20131974 further contributed to a global economic downturn, alarming investors and corporate owners.\nPowell\u2019s memo emphasized the domestic threats to corporate America, but abroad, even more pervasive challenges to United States\u2013based corporate control were emerging."}
