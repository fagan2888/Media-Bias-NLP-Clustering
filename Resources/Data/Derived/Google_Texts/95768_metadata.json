My father had promised me the night before that he would tell me a new story instead of taking me to the movies, which was our usual weekend treat. That was when he first introduced me to Alice. I think he made a fair amount of it up as he went along, as I never found many of his Alice stories when I was old enough to read the books myself. But I can still remember his describing how Alice, having taken a big gulp of a special potion, began to grow smaller and smaller. \u201cAnd then,\u201d he said, \u201cshe discovered a hooka smoking caterpillar.\u201d\n\nNow I was quite familiar with caterpillars \u2014 in those days we could buy them in cocoons from street vendors with a handful of leaves and watch them turn into butterflies \u2014 and everyone had a cousin or uncle who was overfond of a hooka. But Alice, who had never seen a hooka-smoking caterpillar, quite naturally asked him, \u201cWho are you?\u201d And the caterpillar threw the question right back at her, saying: \u201cWho, Who Who are Youuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu?\u201d\n\n\u201cTow Tow Tow, Key Haaaastiiiiiiiiiiii?\u201d my father would say, mimicking the caterpillar in Persian. He repeated this several times and each time I laughed louder, with tears streaming down my face as my mother, glancing at me reproachfully, urged me to refrain from spitting out my bread. But my father was in a playful mood, and he paid no attention to my mother\u2019s protestations as he tickled me and said it again.\n\nLater on I would sit my gentle and compliant 2-year-old brother against the wall of our room and say, \u201cTow Tow Tow Key Haaastiiiii?\u201d tickling him around the navel. He smiled at me in amazement in what may have been the only time I had the privilege of actually amazing him.\n\nSince then I have read \u201cAlice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland\u201d and \u201cThrough the Looking Glass\u201d many times in many different places, carrying her with me on a journey that has had its share of unexpected encounters defying all logic and explanation.\n\n* * *\n\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d Isn\u2019t this what every book asks of us as we chase its characters, trying to find out what they are reluctant to reveal? Is it not also the one essential thing we ask ourselves as human beings, as we struggle to make the choices that will define us? I can describe myself as a mother, a wife, a friend, a teacher, a sister, a writer, a reader \u2026. So it goes. Yet none of these simple labels provides a satisfactory response. We are how we live, constantly in a state of flux. But it is essential to ask and be asked that question, one which I believe is at the heart both of the act of writing and of reading.\n\nOver the years I have often thought of Alice as my ideal reader, the one I aspire to be. Out of millions of young girls there is one who is not smug and satisfied with what she already has, who can see the world differently. She sees not just a white rabbit, but one who talks and has a watch and a waistcoat. She runs after it and jumps into a hole, \u201cnever once considering how in the world she was to get out again. \u201cBurning curiosity\u201d is what motivates her, giving her the courage of the scientist who pursues knowledge despite his inability to control the results.\n\nMore than almost any other fictional character, Alice is in constant conversation with herself and others: probing, asking, reminding me of my infant daughter who would call out for me and, when I entered the room in the dim light of early morning, point to the objects around her and ask, \u201ceeee cheyah? eee cheyah?\u201d \u201cwassdis? wassdis?\u201d\n\nEvery day we travel back and forth between reality and wonderland \u2014 being and becoming. I was a young child when reading first became a home, a place from which I felt I could evaluate the world and my position in it \u2014 a place of doubt but also a haven. Now, like Alice, every time I read a great book I leave my old self behind.\n\nThe usual word we associate with children is \u201cinnocence,\u201d but Alice is eager to shed her innocence. Curiosity motivates the child within us to search for knowledge, to refuse to remain innocent about the world. The loss of innocence is always accompanied by pain, separation and cruelty. It has ever been so, from the first sin of Adam and Eve.\n\nThroughout my life, I have come across Alice and her caterpillar in surprising places. Alice, of course, is a miraculous entity herself, more marvelous and mysterious than any of the marvelous and mysterious creatures she meets: Unlike them, she can not only live in two worlds, but she can see through each one; she has access to the voice within, the third eye of imagination.\n\nOne could say that she can afford to take risks because she is, at bottom, confident and rooted. Alice, unlike me, could always return to her actual home, the one with the kittens and lace curtains. She had a routine and a structure and clear expectations. When she finds herself lost in Wonderland, or in the Looking Glass World, she can seek help from her other life. And yet Wonderland is just as essential a lifeline when she returns home. Alice reminds us that it is not just at times of isolation, exile and danger, but also when life is stable and secure that you need wonderland. This is a lessons that has served me well over the years.\n\n\u201cAll art is the result of one\u2019s having been in danger, of having gone through an experience all the way to the end, where no one can get any further,\u201d wrote Rilke, and it is true that so many of the best novels from around the world have at their core that essential kernel of danger. This is of course true of many great works of children\u2019s fiction, where our heroes and heroines have monsters and demons and wicked stepmothers to outwit and overcome. But it is also true of the grown-up novels whose monsters and heroes are internalized and more like us.\n\n* * *\n\nWhen I last re-read \u201cAlice in Wonderland\u201d I was amazed at how British Alice is: She is such a well-behaved girl. As she falls through the hole she tries to maintain her bearings by identifying the objects she sees, and remembering her past. Having imbibed a good solid British education, she does not throw the jar of marmalade down the hole, but manages to place it on a shelf as she is falling \u2014 she needs no one to tell her to do the right thing, she is her own inner monitor.\n\nBeing prepared to see the world through the eyes of others, to be curious about them, is a characteristic I have found in a number of British novels \u2014 the novels of manners are not simply about being polite and proper in the conventional sense of the word. They are about seeing and listening, respecting others and acknowledging them. In Jane Austen\u2019s novels, characters who are open to our ridicule, the villains, are those who, like Mr. Collins, Mrs. Bennet or Lady Catherine de Burg in \u201cPride and Prejudice,\u201d are self-involved and conventional, imposing their choices and preferences on those around them.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Salon exclusive: The \"Reading Lolita in Tehran\" author on the permanent delights of reading \"Alice in Wonderland\"", "title": "Azar Nafisi: \u201cOver the years I have often thought of Alice as my ideal reader\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Salon exclusive: The \"Reading Lolita in Tehran\" author on the permanent delights of reading \"Alice in Wonderland\"", "title": "Azar Nafisi: \u201cOver the years I have often thought of Alice as my ideal reader\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/07/12/azar_nafisi_over_the_years_i_have_often_thought_of_alice_as_my_ideal_reader/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/azar_nafisi.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Salon exclusive: The \"Reading Lolita in Tehran\" author on the permanent delights of reading \"Alice in Wonderland\"", "title": "Azar Nafisi: \u201cOver the years I have often thought of Alice as my ideal reader\u201d", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/azar_nafisi.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Azar Nafisi", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Alice in Wonderland, Azar Nafisi, Books, Iran, Reading Lolita in Tehran", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2da7\"", "article_summary": "Later on I would sit my gentle and compliant 2-year-old brother against the wall of our room and say, \u201cTow Tow Tow Key Haaastiiiii?\u201d tickling him around the navel.\nBut I can still remember his describing how Alice, having taken a big gulp of a special potion, began to grow smaller and smaller.\nOver the years I have often thought of Alice as my ideal reader, the one I aspire to be.\n* * *When I last re-read \u201cAlice in Wonderland\u201d I was amazed at how British Alice is: She is such a well-behaved girl.\nTopics: Alice in Wonderland, Azar Nafisi, Books, Iran, Reading Lolita in Tehran, Entertainment NewsIt all began one Friday morning, a weekend in Iran, over breakfast."}
