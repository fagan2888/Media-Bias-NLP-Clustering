Investigative journalist Sharyl Attkisson explains the ethical debate surrounding a multiyear study of these fragile infants, in the third part of her \u201cFull Disclosure\u201dseries for The Daily Signal.\n\nSUPPORT, a study that deliberately manipulated oxygen levels assigned to extremely premature babies, was sponsored by the National Institutes of Health, a branch of the Department of Health and Human Services. The body responsible for monitoring ethics violations in such studies, the Office for Human Research Protections, is also a part of HHS.\n\nAccording to Attkisson\u2019s report, this resulted in a \u201cgovernment vs. government\u201d dispute. \u201cThe federal government funded the study, basically approved the study, [and] oversaw the study,\u201d she said in the interview. \u201cI think it\u2019s clear that the federal government, at the very least, made a mistake.\u201d\n\nThe HHS ethics body\u2019s attempts to enforce what it found to be violations of the parental consent process stalled because of \u201cpressure by the research community and by senior officials in the federal government who really didn\u2019t want this to go much further,\u201d Attkisson said. Going forward, she argues, \u201cThere needs to be something that\u2019s said at the end of all this. What did the researchers do wrong, what do they need to do to correct this and make sure the same type of thing doesn\u2019t happen again?\u201d\n\nPart 1: Did Government\u2019s Experiment on Preemies Hide Risks?\n\nPart 2: \u2018Input\u2019 Stalls Agency\u2019s Ethics Probe in Baby Oxygen Trials\n\nPart 3: Parents Fault Study for Putting Preemies in Harm\u2019s Way", "article_metadata": {"description": "Did a government-funded experiment put the lives of 1,316 premature babies at risk?
