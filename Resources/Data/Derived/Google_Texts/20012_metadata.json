People living throughout the continent have long altered their bodies to keep up with fashion trends \u2014 the latest being midriff surgeries to complement high-waisted pants \u2014 with Colombia and Brazil among the top countries to have their women under the knife. Venezuela, however, holds the title of South American country with the most procedures, with 7.6 people per 1,000 people getting some kind of plastic surgery in 2013. Now, it seems, the country has reached capacity for large-breasted women; it\u2019s facing a shortage in brand-name breast implants.\n\nThe shortage is mostly due to restrictive currency controls implemented in 2003 when Hugo Chavez was president. As a result, the Venezuelan Bolivar was largely devalued, making it difficult for local businesses to import foreign goods, including silicone gel breast implants from the U.S. With more than 85,000 implantations completed last year, thousands of women are now being forced to deal with their insecurities. \u201cThe women are complaining,\u201d Ramon Zapata, president of the Society of Plastic Surgeons, told The Associated Press. \u201cVenezuelan women are very concerned with their self-esteem.\u201d\n\nThroughout the continent, girls as young as 14 get plastic surgery, and it\u2019s not unheard of for a girl to get breast implants on her 15th birthday \u2014 her quincea\u00f1era \u2014 which is akin to a sweet 16, and celebrated in various parts of Latin America. From a young age, girls are taught more about the \u201cvalue\u201d of being beautiful than about striving to be powerful women. \u201cIt\u2019s a culture of \u2018I want to be more beautiful than you.\u2019 That\u2019s why even people who live in the slums get implants,\u201d surgeon Daniel Slobodianik told the AP.\n\nThis hypersexualization of women is widespread throughout most of South America. As NPR reported in Brazil, despite being well-represented in the workforce (the country even has a female president), women are still sexualized in programming, magazines, and the general public. They feel the pressure to conform to \u201cwhat they think men want,\u201d psychoanalyst Regina Navarro told Brazil\u2019s Glamour magazine. This mindset is further engrained through the countless mannequins with enlarged breasts, tiny waists, and disproportionately large backsides lining storefront windows. It\u2019s these factors that lead many of them to undergo cosmetic surgery, getting everything from breast implants to vaginal reconstruction.\n\nNow, with low self-esteem and very limited access to breast implants of a desired size, many of the women are turning to China, where implants can be bought for about a third the price of European-regulated implants. The implants, however, aren\u2019t subject to random government inspections or clinical studies, so their safety is questionable. \u201cI\u2019m not saying they\u2019re not safe, but I\u2019ve removed more than a few ruptured Chinese implants,\u201d Slobodianik said. \u201cI just don\u2019t feel comfortable with them.\u201d Meanwhile, others are turning to an online black market in which sellers post pictures of implants from unknown origins. We all know the dangers of those.\n\nMaybe this shortage in implants will inspire some Venezuelan women to work on building their self-esteem without the need for cosmetic surgery. Social media has already called for them to consider this, with some saying that the only shortage the country faces is values, and others joking that the country can now work on its personalities, with Twitter hashtags noting the Colombian telenovela Sin Tetas, No Hay Paraiso, or \u201cWithout Breasts, There\u2019s No Paradise.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "venezuelan, breast, implant, shortage, may, help, women, consider, enhancing, their, self", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Venezuela ranks highest when it comes to the number of cosmetic surgery procedures, but with shortages in U.S.-made breast implants, many women are starting to panic.", "title": "Panic Sweeps Venezuela Because Of A Shortage In...
