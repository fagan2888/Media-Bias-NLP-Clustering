But they add that recruiting is a year around enterprise due to steady population growth.\n\n\"We are losing some of the seasonality. We need people here largely because of (patient) volume,\" said Renee Thigpen, associate chief human resources officer with the NCH Healthcare System in Collier County. \"We believe it is the new reality, the growth of the area and the growth of the (hospital) system.\"\n\nWith a total of 716 beds at two hospital campuses and numerous outpatient medical services, NCH is at 4,100 employers and growing.\n\n\"We have hired 300 registered nurses since January,\" she said. \"We had to be creative. All over the nation, everyone is trying to find experienced R.N.'s.\"\n\nSign on bonuses range from $2,500 to $15,000 depending on the nursing specialty and the shift.\n\n\"That is about what it is everywhere. We are not unique,\" she said. A relocation allowance can be from $1,000 to $10,000, she said.\n\nThree recruiters recently went to Michigan and Ohio to conduct interviews. Jobs for some qualified candidates would be offered on the spot, Thigpen said.\n\nAt Collier's Physicians Regional Health System, \u2014 with 201 beds at two campuses and 1,500 employees \u2014 the hunt is on for employees, seasonally and beyond, hospital spokeswoman Marti Van Veen said.\n\n\"We have definitely increased hiring during season but hiring is a year round effort,\" Van Veen said. \"Our recruitment efforts begin locally. We work with several area schools. However, we also recruit nationwide, and have hired nurses from Michigan, Ohio, New York and other states.\"\n\nSign on bonuses and relocation allowances are offered for hard-to-fill positions, and they vary.\n\nAn aging population nationwide and increased number of people with insurance under the Affordable Care Act's passage has driven need for more nurses and other medical professionals. That's coupled with high numbers of nurses who are retiring, national studies show.\n\nA nursing shortage report compiled this year by NSI Nursing Solutions, which compiled data from 100 different reports, shows 118,000 registered nurses have been leaving the workforce over the last five years, coupled with 136,000 retirements in 2015 alone.\n\nFifty-eight percent of hospitals are not prepared for nurse retirements, according to the data. Worse, the projected undersupply of nurses is more than 250,000.\n\nThe Lee Memorial Health System, with a total of 1,419 beds at four acute care hospitals and a children's hospital in Lee County and numerous outpatient medical centers, has nearly 12,000 employees today and a vacancy rate of 6.8 percent for all types of employees, said Kristy Rigot, system director of recruitment and retention.\n\nHiring is done all year, but it begins in May every year for the seasonal months to have the new recruits in place by the end of November, she said.\n\nSo far, 228 seasonal nurses have been hired but Lee Memorial also hired more than 2,700 new employees last year, she said.\n\nLee Memorial offers a $10,000 relocation incentive if they are outside of the local market and a $10,000 stimulus if the nurses start before Dec. 31, she said.\n\nIt is higher than what it was in the past, which was $5,000 to $7,000 for a relocation incentive and start date incentive of $5,000.\n\n\"We also recognize the importance of rewarding our own employees' referrals,\" she said. \"We reward our staff for qualified nurses' referrals with $2,500 and $5,000 referral for critical care.\"", "article_metadata": {"title": "Nurses can write their own tickets as demand skyrockets", "og": {"url": "http://www.naplesnews.com/news/health/nurses-can-write-their-own-tickets-as-demand-skyrockets-25649cde-6244-1f1a-e053-0100007fda7b-355046421.html", "image": {"width": 1701, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/iStock_000010835304_Medium.jpg", "height": 1129}, "type": "article", "description": "Southwest Florida hospitals are scouting for experienced nurses and other medical professionals in Michigan, Ohio and elsewhere to beef up staffing for the busy seasonal months.", "title": "Nurses can write their own tickets as demand skyrockets"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ndn", "image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/iStock_000010835304_Medium.jpg", "description": "Southwest Florida hospitals are scouting for experienced nurses and other medical professionals in Michigan, Ohio and elsewhere to beef up staffing for the busy seasonal months.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Nurses can write their own tickets as demand skyrockets"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-ndn-icon-144.png", "__sync_contentCategory": "premium", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1e59\"", "article_summary": "\"We believe it is the new reality, the growth of the area and the growth of the (hospital) system.\"\nBy Liz Freeman of the Naples Daily NewsRejoice registered nurses, you're going to get plenty of attention from human resource officers, and bountiful sign-on bonuses, too.\nHowever, we also recruit nationwide, and have hired nurses from Michigan, Ohio, New York and other states.\"\n\"We have hired 300 registered nurses since January,\" she said.\nSo far, 228 seasonal nurses have been hired but Lee Memorial also hired more than 2,700 new employees last year, she said."}
