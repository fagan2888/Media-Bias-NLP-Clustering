But Iowa senator and Obamacare champion Tom Harkin serves as chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. He just returned from an official tour of Stalinist Cuba hailing its health care as \u201cquite remarkable.\u201d\n\n\u201cCuba\u2019s a poor country,\u201d he marveled. \u201cBut they have a lower child mortality rate than us\u2026.their public health system is quite remarkable.\u201d\n\nWhat Sen. Harkin actually believes to be true or \u201cquite remarkable\u201d might be (implicitly) worthy of emulation. If so, this would affect the lives of millions of Americans. After all, Sen. Harkin is still a few months away from retirement and still banging the drums deafeningly for Obamacare from his chairman\u2019s seat.\n\nIt\u2019s an old story with this senator, actually.\n\nIn April 1985 while President Ronald Reagan sought to aid Nicaragua\u2019s desperate anti-communist guerrillas, freshman Sens. Harkin and John Kerry visited Nicaragua, met with the Sandinista (communist) leaders and returned smitten with their dedication to democracy and their enmity towards the Soviets.\n\nPresident Reagan\u2019s obsession with Central American communism and his aid to the Contras was a manifestation of simple \u201cMc McCarthyism,\u201d sneered the freshman Democratic senators. The proof was in a \u201cpeace-proposal\u201d signed by Sandinista leader and Castro-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Daniel Ortega that Kerry and Harkin \u201cheld in their hands\u201d and read convincingly to Congress. Its purpose was to kill President Reagan\u2019s Contra-aid bill.\n\nIt worked like a charm. The U.S. Congress swallowed the Communist scam hook, line and sinker and killed the president\u2019s bill. Then exactly three days later a snickering Daniel Ortega was in Moscow, flouting his Soviet ties for all the world to see. The Castro-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 returned to Managua with a $200 million Soviet aid package, along with a bigger pledge of arms and Cuban advisors to crush the Contras.\n\nSo Congress, rotten egg dripping slowly off their face, reversed itself and finally approved Reagan\u2019s Contra aid. Harkin and Kerry ultimately failed\u2014but hey, it\u2019s the thought that counts. They did go the extra mile attempting to aid and comfort communists. The original Sandinista national anthem, by the way, includes the line, \u201cWe fight the Yankees \u2013 the enemy of humanity,\u201d lifted straight from a speech by Che Guevara. It\u2019s nice to know such an outfit charmed the socks off the current U.S. Secretary of State.\n\nSen. Harkin\u2019s official Cuban guides last week \u2013 forgive me for reminding some readers (and perhaps even Sen. Harkin and his staff) \u2013 were apparatchiks of a regime modeled almost perfectly on Stalin\u2019s. Most of the Soviet KGB and GRU agents and advisors who flooded Cuba from 1959-62, had actually worked for Stalin. Raul Castro had a KGB handler as early as 1954.\n\n\u201cThe solution to the world\u2019s problem lie behind the Iron Curtain,\u201d proclaimed the regime\u2019s co-founder Che Guevara, who often signed his correspondence as \u201cStalin II.\u201d\n\nIn fairness, Sen. Harkin follows in the footsteps of a long procession of (hopefully!) dupes. But in contrast, there finally came a day when most people recognized that official tours of Stalinist Russia were pure scams. The term \u201cPotemkin Tours\u201d even came into common usage (even among liberals) to describe them.\n\nAlas, such a forehead-slapping \u201crevelation\u201d about official tours of Stalinist Cuba doesn\u2019t occur to most people, for some reason.\n\nAccording to \u201cThe National Journal\u201d Sen. Harkin also marveled at \u201cthe country\u2019s (Cuba\u2019s) success in reducing smoking among citizens through public health campaigns.\u201d\n\nOh it\u2019s a \u201cgovernment campaign\u201d alright, Sen. Harkin. To wit: For the usual communist reasons a communist regime cannot stock the shelves in its stores. This \u2013 amazingly enough \u2013 decreases the consumption of those products by the communist regime\u2019s hapless and half-starved subjects!\n\n\u201cQuite remarkable\u201d how that works, Sen. Harkin!\n\nAnd it\u2019s not only for smoking. This \u201creduction\u201d also applies to eating, as in items like milk, beef and bread. In fact as fully-documented in a new book - along with infectious diseases that had been virtually eradicated in pre-Castro Cuba (Dengue-Fever, Cholera) \u2013 nutritional diseases are also rampant nowadays in the Castro family fiefdom. Marzo Fernandez, an economist who until defecting in 1996, served as Secretary General of Castro\u2019s Ministry of Nutrition could help shatter many of Sen. Harkin\u2019s illusions.\n\n\u201cThe average height of Cubans has decreased by 8 centimeters in the past 25 years,\u201d he\u2019s quoted in the book. \u201cFor the first time in Cuban history, thousands of macrocepahlic children (abnormally large heads in proportion to their bodies) due to protein (primarily milk) deficiencies have been found in the eastern provinces.\u201d\n\nNow regarding that vaunted Cuban infant-mortality rate, parroted by Harkin (among many others) some clarifications:\n\nIn 1958 (the year prior to the glorious revolution) Cuba ranked 13th from the top, worldwide with the lowest infant-mortality rate. This meant that robustly capitalist pre-Castro Cuba had the 13th lowest infant-mortality rate in the world. This put her not only at the top in Latin America but atop most of Western Europe, ahead of France, Belgium, West Germany, Israel, Japan, Austria, Italy, Spain, and Portugal. Today all of these countries leave Communist Cuba in the dust, with much lower infant mortality rates.\n\nAnd even plummeting from 13th (capitalist) to 47th (communist), Cuba\u2019s \u201cquite remarkable\u201d infant mortality rate is kept artificially low by Communist chicanery with statistics and by a truly appalling abortion rate of 0.71 abortions per live birth. This is the hemisphere\u2019s highest, by far. Any Cuban pregnancy that even hints at trouble gets \u201cterminated.\u201d\n\nIn April 2001, Dr. Juan Felipe Garc\u00eda, MD, of Jacksonville, Fla., interviewed several recent doctor defectors from Cuba. Based on what he heard, he reported the following:\n\n\u201cCuban pediatricians constantly falsify figures for the regime\u201d reveals Dr Garcia. \u201cIf an infant dies during its first year, the doctors often report he was older. Otherwise, such lapses could cost him severe penalties and his job. The official Cuban infant-mortality figure is a farce.\u201c\n\nThe late George Carlin\u2019s \u201cHippy-Dippy Weatherman\u201d had a hilarious skit: \u201cThe radar is picking up a line of thundershowers,\u201d he says points to the map\u2026 \u201cbut it\u2019s also picking up a squadron of Russian ICBMs\u2026 so I wouldn\u2019t sweat the thundershowers.\u201d\n\nIn brief, don\u2019t sweat the small stuff. Perhaps that applies here? To wit: if our very Secretary of State allowed snickering communists to play him like a fiddle, why sweat the same fiddle-playing of a middling and soon-retiring Senate Committee chairman?\n\n\u2013\n\nTheBlaze contributor channel supports an open discourse on a range of views.
