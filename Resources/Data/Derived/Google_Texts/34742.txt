The West Philly woman accused of leaving her quadriplegic son to die in a wooded area is back in Philly and has formally been charged in the incident.

Nyia Parler, 41, was picked up by the Southwest Detectives Fugitive Task Force this morning at the Montgomery County Correctional Facility in Boyds, Md., according to Lt. John Walker, of Southwest Detectives.

Parler had waived her right to extradition at a hearing Tuesday.

She was formally charged this morning with attempted murder, simple assault, aggravated assault, unlawful restraint, kidnapping and related offenses after she allegedly abandoned her son, Daequan Norman, April 6 in a tree-lined area on 59th Street near Cobbs Creek, police said.

Investigators tracked her to Silver Spring, Md., where she had traveled to visit her boyfriend. Police say she left Norman, 21, in the woods wrapped in a blanket, with nothing but his wheelchair and a bible. Parler was arrested in Maryland on April 10, and allegedly provided a confession to police.

Norman, who has cerebral palsy, remains at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, and will be placed in a residential care facility after he's discharged.
