The trade magazine Modern Healthcare asked its readers -- as it does on an annual basis -- who the most influential people are in the business. Some are industry executives with multimillion-dollar compensation packages while others are politicians, like President Barack Obama, with relatively paltry salaries.

Modern Healthcare took in more than 31,000 ballots, which accounted for 50% of the score, while the ratings of its senior editors comprised the other half, and came up with 100 names. Here, we give you the top 10, along with the magazine’s findings on their compensation packages.
