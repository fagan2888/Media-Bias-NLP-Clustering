Optimization of procurement and procedures, coupled with increased insurance coverage, means hospitals are more profitable and record fewer losses from treating uninsured patients.\n\nIBISWorld expects average profitability among hospital managers to rise to 9.1% in the next five years from the current level of 8.8%. But the Affordable Care Act shifts patients away from higher cost settings like hospitals, to lower cost settings such as hospice and palliative centers, upending a traditional profit model that relied heavily on filling hospital beds.\n\n\u201cThe intense regulatory scrutiny around hospitals that are merging is driving many hospitals to create partnerships or joint ventures,\u201d said Jeff Black, a partner in the health-care vertical at \u200bconsultant \u200bMercer LLC. \u201cWe anticipate this trend to continue, creating an additional challenge for PE investors looking to enter the hospital space.\u201d\n\nDr. Ralph de la Torre, founder, chairman and chief executive of Steward Health Care System LLC, which was launched in 2010 with backing from Cerberus Capital Management, said ACA presents an opportunity for hospital operators \u201cto change the game, [by changing] the payment model, not just in isolated hospitals, but for entire health systems.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis requires new expertise from integration to care management to IT, and may be difficult to fund in the debt market,\u201d he said.\n\nStill, Apollo isn\u2019t daunted. \u201cHospitals did not trade up to the same degree as other segments of health-care services,\u201d said Apollo Partner Matthew Nord. \u201cThe sector had traded up after the Affordable Care Act was passed, but more recently, stocks have corrected when people realized their assumptions were too aggressive.\u201d\n\nThe contrarian investor in RegionalCare said hospital investors need to put \u201creal capital\u201d behind hospital deals to facilitate purchases in periphery service providers and build an integrated health-care system. Armed with fresh capital from the $18.4 billion Apollo Investment Fund VIII LP, raised in 2014, Apollo plans to do exactly that.\n\nWrite to Amy Or at amy.or@wsj.com.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Private equity investors have avoided traditional hospital deals despite the sector's size.", "title": "PE Firms Shy Away From Traditional Hospital Deals, Despite Sector\u2019s Size", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2016/01/27/pe-firms-shy-away-from-traditional-hospital-deals-despite-sectors-size/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-MH354_Genera_P_20160126161520.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "PE Firms Shy Away From Traditional Hospital Deals, Despite Sector\u2019s Size", "description": "Private equity investors have avoided traditional hospital deals despite the sector's size.", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Amy Or", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Private Equity Beat Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Private Equity Beat", "article.summary": "Private equity investors have avoided traditional hospital deals despite the sector's size.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2016-01-27T12:00:03-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-210", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2016/01/27/pe-firms-shy-away-from-traditional-hospital-deals-despite-sectors-size/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-PEBB-19486", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Private equity investors have avoided traditional hospital deals despite the sector's size.", "title": "PE Firms Shy Away From Traditional Hospital Deals, Despite Sector\u2019s Size", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2016/01/27/pe-firms-shy-away-from-traditional-hospital-deals-despite-sectors-size/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-MH354_Genera_P_20160126161520.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Private Equity Beat", "article.id": "BL-PEBB-19486", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2016-01-27T17:23:38-05:00"}, "article_summary": "Hospital operations are undergoing a sea change under the Affordable Care Act, which seeks better quality of care at a lower cost.\niStockphoto.com/Peter SpiroApollo Global Management\u2019s investment in community hospital operator RegionalCare Hospital Partners Inc. may have broken a dry spell for private equity investments in large for-profit hospital deals.\nBut private equity investors say the transaction is unlikely to unleash a flood of new deals in the space.\n\u201cHospitals did not trade up to the same degree as other segments of health-care services,\u201d said Apollo Partner Matthew Nord.\nArmed with fresh capital from the $18.4 billion Apollo Investment Fund VIII LP, raised in 2014, Apollo plans to do exactly that."}
