On Sunday, Brandi defended herself against the accusation that she\u2019s lying about it.\n\nBrandi tweeted that she has no reason to lie about filming another show. She added that details on the show will be announced soon and that she only started filming last Friday.\n\n\u201cWhy the F*** would I be lying about doing a new show? Ive not lied before & Im not now. It will be announced soon,as I started it last friday.\u201d\n\nTo prove her point, Brandi even posted a short video of one her sons saying that his mom doesn\u2019t lie.\n\nI don't lie!!! #MyBoyKnows #YouTellEm A video posted by Brandi Glanville (@thebrandiglanville) on Nov 8, 2015 at 10:28am PST\n\nLast Friday, Brandi tweeted that she was up early because of filming.\n\nFilming!\n\nIt seems that Brandi\u2019s new show will not be on Bravo, but on E!. The day prior, in response to a fan who asked when they\u2019ll be hearing more about the show on E!, Brandi promised details would be released soon.\n\nSoon! I promise! \u2764\ufe0f https://t.co/Y7eUho83Z0 \u2014 Brandi Glanville (@BrandiGlanville) November 5, 2015\n\nWhile it may be a while until Brandi Glanville\u2019s fans see her on this new show, since it just started filming, they\u2019ll soon be watching her on The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills. On Thursday, Bravo released the trailer for the sixth season. While Brandi isn\u2019t a starring or recurring housewife on the new season, she will be seen in at least one episode.\n\nIt seems that one storyline viewers will watch unfold in Season 6 is some of the other housewives questioning the existence and/or severity of Yolanda Foster\u2019s Lyme disease. The trailer shows Yolanda going through some scary-looking treatments. Yolanda says that she\u2019s willing to try anything to find a cure, even if means ripping her teeth out. In one scene with her children and mom, Yolanda tells them about her will and says that if anything happens to her, she wants her children to take care of her mom.\n\nLisa Rinna, in a scene with Kyle Richards and Lisa Vanderpump, reads from her phone information about Munchausen Syndrome and Kyle says that it\u2019s confusing for a lot of people. Brandi Glanville is then shown in a scene with Yolanda Foster. Brandi tells Yolanda that she\u2019s being preyed upon.\n\n\u201cThey like to prey on the weak. You\u2019re sick so let\u2019s go after you.\u201d\n\nLater on in the trailer, Yolanda seemingly tells Kyle Richards that she\u2019s \u201cholding a lot in the vault.\u201d To which, Kyle asks, \u201cAre you threatening me?\u201d In another scene, new housewife Erika Jayne accuses Lisa Rinna of talking about or participating in gossip about Yolanda.\n\n\u201cIf you have some balls tell me you said it.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, Yolanda tweeted that people not suffering from Lyme disease simply don\u2019t understand it. Perhaps, Yolanda\u2019s tweet was in reference to what was shown in the trailer in terms of others questioning her disease?\n\n\u2764\ufe0fYou don't get it until YOU GET IT\u2026\u2026. #LymeDiseaseAwareness #WeMustFundACure \u2014 YOLANDA (@YolandaHFoster) November 7, 2015\n\nBy the end of the fifth season, Brandi was at odds with all of the housewives with the exception of Yolanda and Kim Richards. At the reunion show, Lisa Vanderpump said that Yolanda continuously makes excuses for Brandi. Host Andy Cohen said that it seems Yolanda has taken the position as the show\u2019s peacemaker. Yolanda replied that the other women shouldn\u2019t be so judgmental of Brandi, and that she won\u2019t let Brandi push her aside.\n\n\u201cWell I don\u2019t think I give her a pass. I think I don\u2019t make excuses for her. I think it\u2019s very easy for all of us to just kick her to the curb like a bag of trash and move on with life and pretend we\u2019re all so perfect and great. But none of us are great. I just, in my heart, feel that she needs all of us and I will not allow her to push me to the side because that\u2019s what everybody does.\u201d\n\nAs previously reported by the Inquisitr, Yolanda Foster, Brandi Glanville and Kim Richards, who also appeared on the Season 6 trailer, got together in September to celebrate Kim\u2019s 51st birthday.\n\nBirthday lunch for my friend @KimRichards11 with the strong & Amazing @YolandaHFoster #realfriends\n\nPerhaps that birthday get together will be shown on the upcoming season? The sixth season of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills premieres on Tuesday, December 1.\n\n[Photo by Andrew H.
