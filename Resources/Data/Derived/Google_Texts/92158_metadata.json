Sinai CEO about cost disclosure.\n\nAlmost a year and a half ago, Mt. Sinai Medical Center CEO Steve Sonenreich pledged on WLRN to make public what insurance companies pay his hospital.\n\nHe later told us that because of non-disclosure agreements between the hospital and the region\u2019s insurance companies, he legally couldn\u2019t share that information after all.\n\nLISTEN: Steve Sonenreich pledges to release information about the amounts insurers pay his hospital.\n\nIt turns out these secrecy agreements are standard practice between South Florida insurers and hospitals.\n\nSo how can consumers understand the true cost of their health care? And what does it mean for employers and employees who face rising costs for coverage every year?\n\nIn this Power of Price special hour, we examine the limits of transparency around health care costs and what that means for our region.\n\nJoin us at 9 a.m. and again at 7 p.m. as we explore how the secrecy of health care pricing reverberates through the industry and on to the consumer.\n\nSee all our Power of Price coverage at WLRN.org/price and see the Miami Herald's Power of Price series here.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Radio", "description": "Almost a year and a half ago, Mt.
