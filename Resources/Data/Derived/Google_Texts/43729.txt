It’s been 13 days since our last earthquake — a 2.2-magnitude temblor in Irving that was hardly noticed. Time to reset the days-since calendar.

The U.S. Geological Survey confirms what many folks felt at 9:09 tonight, a small quake not far from the old Texas Stadium site. Tonight’s was a 2.4-magnitude quake off 183, just south of the Four Seasons Resort. This was our 88th in the past year, give or take.

According to the USGS it was felt in Irving and Dallas. Many folks likely thought it was just thunder.

Severe weather’s expected tomorrow night. Stay strong.
