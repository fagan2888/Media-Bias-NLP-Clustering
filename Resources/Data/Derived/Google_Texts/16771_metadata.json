In addition to maintaining road closures, Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) crews are beginning to assess the damage and review the structural integrity of state roads and bridges.\n\nCDOT is advising motorists to exercise extra caution when traveling across the Front Range, as some highways may appear structurally sound but could have been damaged by water, rocks, or debris. In addition to driving carefully, motorists should not pull over to view flood damage or water flows because it creates a safety hazard on the highways.\n\nMotorists also are reminded that the route that opened to Estes Park last night is only for emergency personnel, Estes Park residents, delivery vehicles, and other essential visitors. CDOT is enforcing checkpoints at varying locations to ensure only those with critical missions can enter and exit the town until more permanent repairs can be made. Rocky Mountain National Park remains closed to tourists.\n\nMany highways and bridges remain closed until further notice as a precaution until crews can evaluate whether or not they are safe for travel.\n\nStatus of Highways:\n\nNOW OPEN\n\n*I-25 between U.S. 34 & Wyoming State Line\n\n*U.S. 34 between Granby & Estes Park (Trail Ridge Road) \u2013 Essential travel only\n\n*I-25 northbound /southbound ramps to State Highway 119 open \u2013 travel only allowed east of interchange due to SH 119 closure west of I-25\n\nNEW CLOSURES\n\n*SH 144 between U.S. 34 & SH 39 in Goodrich\n\n*SH 39 between I-76 in Wiggins & Goodrich\n\nONGOING CLOSURES/NORTHERN COLORADO\n\n*SH 119 between County Line Road & I-25\n\n*SH 119 between Boulder & Nederland (Boulder Canyon)\n\n*SH 170 between SH 93 & Eldorado Canyon State Park\n\n*U.S. 34 between Glade Road & Estes Park\n\n*U.S. 36 between Boulder & Estes Park\n\n*U.S. 34 between mile 114 (east of Greeley) & Wiggins (I-76)\n\n*U.S. 85 between SH 52 & County Road 49 in Greeley\n\n*U.S. 85 between 42nd in Evans & County Road 44 in LaSalle\n\n*U.S. 287 at Big Thompson River in Loveland between SH 402 & 5th Street\n\n*U.S. 287 between MP 307 (Isabella) & MP 310 (SH 52)\n\n*SH 7 between Lyons & Estes Park\n\n*SH 14 between Ted's Place & Walden\n\n*SH 60 at CR 46\n\nSH 66 between 53rd Street (Longmont) & Lyons\n\n*SH 66 between CR 13 & CR 19\n\n*SH 257 between SH 60/Milliken & U.S. 34\n\n*SH 392 between I-25 (CR 5) & 17th Street in Windsor\n\nDENVER AREA CLOSURES\n\n* I-70 eastbound off-ramp to Quebec Street\n\n*SH 72 (Indiana Street) between 72nd & 80th avenues\n\n*SH 72 between SH 93 & SH 119 (Coal Creek Canyon);\n\n*SH 83 (Parker Road) between Florida & Jewell avenues\n\nPlease note that the above listed closures are only for state highways; additional road and bridge closures should be expected in cities, counties, and towns.\n\nCurrently CDOT\u2019s www.cotrip.org website is experiencing technical difficulties.
