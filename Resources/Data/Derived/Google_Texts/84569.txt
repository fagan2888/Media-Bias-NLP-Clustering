â€” A 55-year-old store clerk was shot and killed late Monday at a gas station on Raleigh Road in Henderson, police said.

According to investigators, Ahmed Shahit, of Henderson, was shot after two men entered the Best Bet Food Mart and demanded money at about 10:30 p.m. The men left the store on foot, police said.

Shahit was pronounced dead at the scene.

Friends said Shahit was from Yemen, where his wife and children live. He had no family in the area. He worked at the store for three years and walked there from a nearby duplex where he lived.

Customer Furman Jackson said Shahit had moved to the U.S., hoping for a better life.



"It's bad when you've got to kill a person to obtain the money he's worked for," Jackson said. "He had no idea when he walked out of that store, his life would be (taken) from him."



Anyone with information about the shooting should call the Henderson Police Department at 252-438-4141 or Henderson-Vance Crime Stoppers at 252-492-1925.

Crime Stoppers will pay rewards of up to $2,000 for information leading to arrests in felony cases.
