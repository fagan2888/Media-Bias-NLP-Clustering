Private health insurance is not generally available throughout the year, insurers say, with most carriers restricting their \u201copen enrollment\u201d period to a few months a year.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act includes a fine of $95 or 1 percent of income for anyone who was eligible for health insurance yet did not purchase a policy. In Washington-speak, it\u2019s called a \u201cfee,\u201d or the \u201cindividual shared responsibility payment.\u201d\n\nAs explained by U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius at a recent New Jersey appearance, the fee was imposed because people who decide to forgo health insurance can sometimes end up in a hospital emergency room. Once there, they will receive \u201ccharity\u201d care, or care the hospital is able to provide by charging all of its patients a bit more.\n\nIt\u2019s only right, then, that those people contribute a little something toward the cost of their free care, she said. The fine starts small but will grow in subsequent years.\n\n\u201cWhen someone without health coverage gets urgent \u2014 often expensive \u2014 medical care but doesn\u2019t pay the bill, everyone else ends up paying the price,\u201d states the federal website, healthcare.gov.\n\nIt is up to the IRS to ultimately collect the fine when next year\u2019s taxes are filed.\n\nThat punishment was vastly watered down as the Affordable Care Act went through Congress, noted Michael Tanner of the Cato Institute, the libertarian think tank.\n\nAfraid of looking punitive, the law\u2019s sponsors not only included great latitude in letting people avoid the fine, he said, but also declawed the IRS in enforcing the requirement to get insured.\n\nIf you didn\u2019t buy health insurance and are owed a refund when you file your taxes next year, the federal government can collect the fine out of your refund.\n\nBut if you didn\u2019t withhold enough for your taxes and end up owing the government, the IRS has no easy way to get the additional fee from you, Tanner said. IRS regulations state the agency is prohibited from using liens or levies to collect the payments owed by the uninsured.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a minimal effort to enforce it, and that\u2019s on purpose,\u201d Tanner said. \u201cThe chances of them coming after you is slim.\u201d\n\nThe new law recognizes that sometimes life doesn\u2019t go smoothly, and offers a number of ways to claim a \u201chardship\u201d exemption from the fine:\n\n\u2022 The federal website, healthcare.gov, mentions being homeless, filing for bankruptcy, being a recent victim of domestic violence, or having been evicted in the past six months, as sufficient reason to have neglected to purchase health insurance.\n\n\u2022 One broad category of people who won\u2019t be fined is people who cannot afford coverage, even with a subsidy. This applies to people whose payment for insurance, whether purchased directly or through the federal marketplace, eats up more than 8 percent of household income.\n\n\u2022 Another big category is people who make so little they don\u2019t need to file a tax return.\n\n\u2022 If you\u2019re a member of a federally recognized Indian tribe, you needn\u2019t prove you\u2019ve purchased a policy. The Federal Register maintains a list of federally recognized Indian tribes.\n\n\u2022 You don\u2019t have to pay the fine if you a member of certain religious groups. Certain denominations, such as the Amish and Mennonites, are among those that neither pay into Social Security nor receive any benefit from it. To qualify, a religion must be \u201cconscientiously opposed to acceptance of the benefits of any private or public insurance which makes payments in the event of death, disability, old age, or retirement.\u201d\n\nThe IRS says only those religions that have been around since Dec. 31, 1950, can qualify.\n\n\u2022 If you had only a short gap in coverage of under three months, you won\u2019t be fined, according to an explanation on the IRS website.\n\n\u2022 If you are here illegally (and thus can\u2019t buy insurance on the federal website), you won\u2019t be charged a fine for being uninsured.\n\nTo claim the religious conscience exemption and most hardship exemptions, you must make your case on healthcare.gov. Most of the other exemptions are claimed when you fill out your income tax filing, according to the IRS.\n\nTanner said he expects IRS enforcement of the fee component of Obamacare to be quite light, mostly because the Obama administration didn\u2019t want to look as if they were punishing poor people.\n\nHe asked this hypothetical question to explain their political quandary: \u201cAre they going to track down a homeless person and ask him about his health insurance?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "'health-news'", "title": "Still uninsured?
