BOISE, Idaho -- Rep. Mike Simpson has prevailed in the Republican primary for Idaho's 2nd Congressional District, fending off a conservative challenger who drew early support from anti-tax advocates.

U.S. Sen. Jim Risch and Rep. Raul Labrador from the 1st Congressional District also won their respective GOP primaries Tuesday night.

Simpson's opponent, Idaho Falls attorney Bryan Smith, got an endorsement from the Club for Growth. Smith had said Simpson was too liberal for Idaho, citing his October 2013 decision to end the 16-day partial government shutdown Republicans attempted to use to force an end to the federal Affordable Care Act.

Simpson says he has a strong conservative voting record in his eight terms in office.

Simpson will face Democrat Richard Stallings in November. Stallings, a former four-term congressman from Idaho, ran unopposed in the primary.

Risch will now face Democratic challenger Nels Mitchell in November's general election. Mitchell defeated Williams Bryk in the Democratic primary election. Labrador will likely face Democratic state Rep. Shirley Ringo in the 1st District in the November election.

With its strong Republican leanings, Simpson, Labrador and Risch are not expected to be seriously threatened by Democrats in the fall.
