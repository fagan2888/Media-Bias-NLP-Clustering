She leads support groups and prepares meals for her mostly homeless clients. It\u2019s hardly glamorous work, but Ford says this is her dream job. \u201cI know that I\u2019m where I\u2019m supposed to be \u2014 and doing what I\u2019m supposed to be doing,\u201d she says.\n\nEmployees had to scour the state, looking for a vacant psychiatric bed. \u201cThen it\u2019s another 2 to 3 hour drive.\u201d\n\nBut Ford, 71, hasn\u2019t always been so content. She had a traumatic childhood and many bouts of depression. As a younger adult adult she often felt suicidal. She recalls being dragged away to the hospital in Lake County, where she says she felt like she was dumped. There was no psychiatrist or therapist; no peer support or services of any kind.\n\nFord was often forced to wait in the emergency room for hours for an evaluation, suffering all the while. \u201cFirst of all, you hate feeling the way you\u2019re feeling \u2014 horrible, and you can\u2019t face life.\u201d She adds, \u201cYou\u2019re there, waiting, sort of alone in your emotions. It definitely added to my anxiety.\u201d\n\nBy the time county behavioral health workers arrived for evaluations, Ford was often so upset that she was perceived to be in danger of hurting herself. So crisis workers ordered her to be hospitalized \u2014 more than once \u2014 without her consent for a three-day hold. Ford says it was the last thing she wanted. But it wasn\u2019t a matter of admitting her to the hospital affiliated with the emergency room. That hospital had no beds for psychiatric patients. Employees had to scour the state, looking for a vacant psychiatric bed. \u201cThen it\u2019s usually like another 2 to 3 hour drive,\u201d says Ford. \u201cWaiting, you\u2019re in limbo.\u201d\n\nFinally, Ford says, she would be dropped off, frightened and alone, at some unfamiliar place several counties away. \u201cThe door is locked behind you and here you are, surrounded by a bunch of strangers,\u201d says Ford. \u201cIt was horrifying.\u201d\n\nShortage of Acute Psych Beds\n\nThe guiding principle of medicine is to do no harm. Yet, advocates for people with mental illness say they go through this sort of ordeal all the time. Some lawmakers concede there\u2019s a problem. \u201cThere are still significant holes in the system and at or near the top of the list is the shortage of acute psychiatric beds,\u201d says Darrel Steinberg, the President Pro Tem of the California Senate.\n\nSteinberg, the author of the Mental Health Services Act, and other key legislative reforms, says it wasn\u2019t supposed to be this way.\n\nAdvocates for reform wanted to move mental health treatment from locked hospitals to less restrictive, and less costly, community settings. The reform movement goes back to the 60s. People with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder who were once locked away in state asylums now often live with their illnesses in the community. But that reform movement may have gone too far too fast, some advocates say. Over the last 15 years, psychiatric facilities have closed in record numbers. California lost one in three hospital beds once reserved for behavioral health emergencies. At the same time funding shifted from inpatient to outpatient treatment, the system of community care never got fully built.\n\nA wave of corporate hospital closures and county budget cuts resulted in California losing about 4,000 hospital beds once reserved for psychiatric emergencies. Some areas were hit harder than others. Most of the rural northern and Sierra counties have no inpatient mental health services at all.\n\n\u201cWe Do Medical Care Here\u201d\n\nAt Sutter Lakeside Hospital, in the county seat of Lakeport, you can have back surgery, or give birth, but chief administrator Siri Nelson says if you\u2019re hallucinating or suicidal, then you\u2019re out of luck. \u201cWe\u2019re not a psychiatric facility,\u201d says Nelson. \u201cWe do medical care here.\u201d\n\nSerious mental illness is a brain disorder which also requires proper medical care. But Nelson says there simply isn\u2019t enough demand in this small county of 65,000 people to make a psychiatric unit profitable. And that calculation affects a wide array of other county services.\n\nBecause there are no local beds, last year Fire Chief Willie Sapeta had to transport 200 patients out of Lake County for psychiatric treatment. \u201cThose transports can be a four-hour turnaround time to as much as a 10- or 12-hour turnaround,\u201d he says, \u201cwhen we\u2019ve had to go to Salinas or up into Humboldt or Del Norte County.\u201d\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just paramedics who are affected. If the patient is considered potentially dangerous, then law enforcement has to step in. Sheriff\u2019s deputies have had to monitor patients in the emergency department for 10 to 12 hours at a time before a county behavioral health worker arrives.\n\nLt. Chris Chwialkowski, with the Lake County Sheriff\u2019s Department, says the wait is a hardship for the patient, but also for his department. \u201cIf that deputy is on overtime, you\u2019re talking about time-and-a-half,\u201d says Chwialkowski. \u201cIf that deputy\u2019s not on overtime, then you\u2019re taking a deputy off the street.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a bad situation all around, says Kristy Kelly, behavioral health director for Lake County. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult for law enforcement because they may have to stand by to make sure that it\u2019s safe,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult for the ER because that\u2019s their patient and they want to move their patients on. It\u2019s difficult for the Mental Health Department because we\u2019re trying to find a placement and we\u2019re calling and calling and calling and calling, and we\u2019re getting a lot of nos.\n\nWith the scarcity of beds, the moment one patient is discharged from a psychiatric bed, another is moved in. So the timing has to be just right for Kelly\u2019s people to find a vacant bed. \u201cWe just keep calling until we get a yes,\u201d says Kelly.\n\nBack at The Bridge, Ford described how she found peace. About 15 years ago, she reached out to self-help groups and embarked on what she calls a spiritual path. She is much more settled now and says it\u2019s been years since she was hospitalized.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This is the first of three stories about psychiatric inpatient services airing this week on The California Report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In the small town of Clearlake, about a hundred miles north of San Francisco, Carole Ford, a great-grandmother with a mane of silver-gray hair, runs a community", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Sharp Drop in Psychiatric Beds Leaves Severely Mentally Ill With Few Places to Go\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2013\\/12\\/16\\/sharp-drop-in-psychiatric-beds-leaves-severely-mentally-ill-with-few-places-to-go\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2013-12-16 01:05:19\",\"mod_date\":\"2013-12-18 10:57:35\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":16701,\"author_id\":\"8344\",\"author_name\":\"State of Health\",\"author_display_name\":\"State of Health\",\"tags\":[\"Hospitals\",\"Mental Health\"],\"categories\":[\"Community Health\",\"Policy\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2013\\/12\\/Carole-Ford_Korry-e1386982312190.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "In  the small town of Clearlake, about a hundred miles north of San Francisco, Carole Ford, a great-grandmother with a mane of silver-gray hair, runs a community mental health center called The Bridge.
