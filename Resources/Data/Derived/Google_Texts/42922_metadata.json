In addition, Stride Health will alert users if they qualify for government discounts, helping them maximize their healthcare savings, and Stride provides users with access to year-round support through its in-house health insurance experts.\n\n\"Affordable healthcare shouldn't be reserved for those with access to employer-provided plans,\" said Noah Lang, CEO of Stride Health. \"Our goal is to help all workers understand the healthcare options available to them, and make the right decisions to protect their health -- and their wallets. We are thrilled to partner with Work Market and provide its extensive user base with easy access to the healthcare solutions they need.\"\n\nThe Open Enrollment Period for individual health insurance started November 1st, and Work Market's partnership with Stride Health provides freelancers with a timely solution to attain affordable coverage.
