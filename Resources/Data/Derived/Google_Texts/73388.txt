Sen. Rand Paul, Kentucky Republican, managed to tease former Rep. Anthony Weiner and slam former IRS official Lois Lerner in one zinger while speaking to an audience in New Hampshire on Thursday.

The onetime New York congressman was brought down by a phone sexting scandal, while Ms. Lerner’s famously missing emails are at the center of the congressional probe into the tax agency’s conservative targeting scandal.

“How many people here have a cellphone?” Mr. Paul asked the audience, according to Breitbart News, “How many people think it’s none of the government’s damn business what you have on your cellphone?”

“I’ve been thinking that’s true,” Mr. Paul continued. “But I’m really, really worried about Anthony Weiner. Because you know he likes to take his selfies, and he’s had trouble finding a place to put them where the government can’t find them. So I’m thinking maybe Anthony Weiner should put his selfie in Lois Lerner’s emails.”

Mr. Paul was in New Hampshire, site of the nation’s first presidential primary, for political events Thursday and Friday, only fueling speculation he is considering a 2016 White House run. The Kentucky Republican has said he will formally decide whether to run early next year, but admitted to local reporters that he “hasn’t discouraged” the presidential speculation.
