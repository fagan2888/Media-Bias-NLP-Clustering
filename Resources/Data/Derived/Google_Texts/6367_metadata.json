There was a strong turnout... especially for a county better known for its left leaning constituents. The main event was Congressman Cory Gardner, who\u2019s taking on Democratic incumbent Mark Udall.\n\nAs the hallway leading into the ballroom fills, dinner hasn\u2019t started yet, and longtime Republican Sabrina Stratford is enjoying a drink. It\u2019s her first political event in the Roaring Fork Valley\n\n\u201cJust moved up from Denver a couple of years ago, course voted last year, but haven\u2019t been really plugged into the political scene. So now getting more and more concerned about issues, I kind of want to start showing up.\u201d\n\nStratford lives in the Woody Creek area, and says one motivator is fracking.\n\n\u201cAnd I think that we can be responsible conservative Republicans and still take care of the planet, so I\u2019m really interested to see how we approach that from a middle of the road space.\u201d\n\nEddie Kessler, of Aspen, is frustrated with what he believes is a trend toward over- regulation. Red tape is getting in the way of creating jobs.\n\n\u201cAnd the middle class is suffering. Most of the people in this room are not suffering, but the middle class, and the poor people, are the people really stuck between a rock and a hard place, due to economic policies.\u201d\n\nAs dinner begins, featured speakers repeat those worries about a hamstrung economy. But they\u2019re also nearly ecstatic about how many Republicans are in the room\u2026 a testament to how the Pitkin County contingent has grown in the last few years. To the enthusiastic crowd, a range of GOP candidates make their case for donations. Right in the middle is Don Suppes. He\u2019s running for the Colorado State Senate seat that includes Pitkin County.\n\n\u201cSenate District Five, is this state\u2019s best chance for Republican majority in the State Senate. We are one seat shy from taking away the majority, from the Democrats. One seat.\u201d\n\nThere are a few attacks on Democrats and their policies, mostly about the Affordable Care Act\u2026 otherwise known as Obamacare.\n\nSpecial guest and U.S. Senate candidate Cory Gardner goes last. Silver haired and baby faced, the thirty nine year old is bursting with energy\u2026 largely about improving the economy.\n\n\u201cBut we have another task before us, as Republicans. We must refuse to be the party of no. But instead be the party that is committed to getting government out of the way, and letting America work.\u201d\n\nGardner has galvanized the party, showing a good shot at beating incumbent Democrat Mark Udall. It\u2019s had an effect nationally, with the race part of a larger GOP game plan to retake the US Senate. After the official talk, someone brings up the elephant in the room. Senator Udall\u2019s TV advertisements have followed a Democratic blueprint, attacking Gardner for his views on abortion, rape, and other issues dubbed \u201cThe War on Women.\u201d Republicans argue some of the ads are patently wrong. Tonight, Gardner clearly doesn\u2019t want to go there, instead choosing a side blow.\n\n\u201cNo one has suffered more in this economy than women around this state and country. Because of the lack and jobs and good opportunities. That\u2019s the war on women.\u201d\n\nGardiner also doesn\u2019t address his change of heart on personhood, which legally recognizes a fertilized egg as a person. That could severely restrict abortion and some forms of birth control. In an interview earlier Saturday, Gardner says he changed his stance after learning more about the issue.\n\nAnd with dessert finished, Lincoln Dinner attendees start trickling out. Lynnette Marie Lacerda shakes her head about The War on Women. It feels, she says, like a manufactured issue; a distraction. She believes its up to voters to dig deeper.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not enough to just vote any more. We need to get involved, we need to do our homework, it doesn\u2019t matter whether they\u2019re Republican, Independent or Democrat. Find their voting records and try to sift through and find the authenticity of the person that we\u2019re giving the responsibility to.\u201d\n\nThe November election is now, just three months away.", "article_metadata": {"category": "APR Local News", "description": "Pitkin County Republicans gathered at the Hotel Jerome on Saturday to rally around a long list of local, state and national candidates running for election", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://aspenpublicradio.org/post/gardner-wows-republicans-lincoln-dinner", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/kajx/files/styles/medium/public/201408/Gardner_speaking.JPG", "type": "article", "description": "Pitkin County Republicans gathered at the Hotel Jerome on Saturday to rally around a long list of local, state and national candidates running for election", "title": "Gardner Wows Republicans At Lincoln Dinner"}, "story_id": 339409240, "twitter": {"site": "@aspenpubradio", "card": "summary", "creator": "@aspenpubradio"}, "author": "Elise Thatcher", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Gardner Wows Republicans At Lincoln Dinner"}, "nid": 22847, "datePublished": "2014-08-10", "keywords": "Pitkin County Republicans, republicans, Pitkin County Democrats, democrats, Senator Mark Udall, Elise Thatcher, Midterm Elections 2014", "wordCount": 896, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "He\u2019s running for the Colorado State Senate seat that includes Pitkin County.\n\u201cSenate District Five, is this state\u2019s best chance for Republican majority in the State Senate.\nAs the hallway leading into the ballroom fills, dinner hasn\u2019t started yet, and longtime Republican Sabrina Stratford is enjoying a drink.\nSenator Udall\u2019s TV advertisements have followed a Democratic blueprint, attacking Gardner for his views on abortion, rape, and other issues dubbed \u201cThe War on Women.\u201d Republicans argue some of the ads are patently wrong.\nIn an interview earlier Saturday, Gardner says he changed his stance after learning more about the issue."}
