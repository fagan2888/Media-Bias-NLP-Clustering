San Miguel County authorities are searching for an Egnar man who has repeatedly called law enforcement dispatch in the past 48 hours threatening to kill county deputies.

Eldon Dick, 55, is considered armed and dangerous and mentally unstable, sheriff’s officials said.

Deputies were contacted this week by a family renting a modular home on Dick’s Egnar property who reported that they had been experiencing escalating problems with Dick for weeks. They said he had discharged a firearm at imaginary persons and harassed them.

Deputies executed a search warrant at Dick’s home Thursday and found an estimated $5,500 worth of alleged stolen property, the sheriff’s office said.

San Miguel County Court issued a felony warrant for Dick’s arrest Friday on charges of first-degree felony criminal trespass, felony theft, child abuse, prohibited use of a weapon, harassment and criminal mischief.

On Friday, Dick began calling law enforcement agencies threatening to kill any officers who attempt to approach him, the sheriff’s office said. He screamed that he didn’t care how many officers he took with him and warned authorities to “come with body bags.”
