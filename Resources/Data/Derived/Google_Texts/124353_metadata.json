The federal government is paying for the program that has helped states like Washington dramatically cuts the ranks of the uninsured.\n\nKreidler notes that in states that did not expand Medicaid, the working poor who aren\u2019t insured at work have to choose between paying a federal fine or buying insurance they can\u2019t really afford.\n\nOn Monday, the people who run the state insurance exchange reported 200,000 people signed up for insurance during the open enrollment period that ended Sunday. That\u2019s about 35,000 more people than exchange officials expected.\n\nMore than 150,000 who didn\u2019t have insurance before the Affordable Care Act took effect have likely bought insurance in the individual market outside the exchange, Kreidler said. The rest of the newly insured in Washington state have signed up for Medicaid.\n\nKreidler credits several aspects of the Affordable Care Act for nearly cutting Washington\u2019s uninsured in half: the Medicaid expansion, the provision allowing parents to keep young people on their plans until age 26 and the states\u2019 insurance exchange.\n\nKreidler believes the remaining half a million people will need more help and assistance to sign up for health insurance. Health insurance is still too expensive for low income people who make too much to qualify for Medicaid. And some are still confused about the process.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to take work,\u201d Kreidler acknowledged.\n\nOfficials say the Washington residents still without health insurance are mostly between the ages of 18 and 34, earn lower incomes, are less educated and are mostly white or Hispanic.\n\nKreidler expects the numbers of uninsured people will continue to drop as the federal penalties for being uninsured continue to rise.\n\nAdults who don\u2019t have insurance this year- through work or Medicaid or the individual market - will face penalties of at least $695. Families could be asked to pay more than $2,000 in fines.\n\nProgress has been made in every Washington county, with the biggest changes in Adams, Yakima and Grays Harbor counties, Kreidler said, but the latest figures his department has to show this are from 2014.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The number of uninsured people in Washington state has been cut in half since health care reform took effect, but there are still about half a million uninsured people in the state, the insurance commissioner's office reported Wednesday.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/feb/3/number-of-uninsured-people-in-washington-state-cut/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "The number of uninsured people in Washington state has been cut in half since health care reform took effect, but there are still about half a million uninsured people in the state, the insurance commissioner\u2019s office reported Wednesday.", "title": "Number of uninsured people in Washington state cut in half"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "description": "The number of uninsured people in Washington state has been cut in half since health care reform took effect, but there are still about half a million uninsured people in the state, the insurance comm", "card": "summary", "title": "Number of uninsured people in Washington state cut in half"}, "Author": "DONNA GORDON BLANKINSHIP", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "SEATTLE (AP) - The number of uninsured people in Washington state has been cut in half since health care reform took effect, but there are still about half a million uninsured people in the state, the insurance commissioner\u2019s office reported Wednesday.\nOn Monday, the people who run the state insurance exchange reported 200,000 people signed up for insurance during the open enrollment period that ended Sunday.\nThe rest of the newly insured in Washington state have signed up for Medicaid.\nThe federal government is paying for the program that has helped states like Washington dramatically cuts the ranks of the uninsured.\nKreidler believes the remaining half a million people will need more help and assistance to sign up for health insurance."}
