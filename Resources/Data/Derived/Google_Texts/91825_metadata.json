Mike Pence says the Obama administration has chosen a biased source to evaluate the state\u2019s alternative Medicaid program.\n\nIn a letter sent Thursday to Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell, Pence asks that the federal review be dropped as the state has contracted with an independent evaluator.\n\n\u201cI do not believe (the Healthy Indiana Plan) will be objectively assessed by the chosen contractors,\u201d Pence wrote. \u201cI ask that you intervene in this matter immediately to terminate the second federal evaluation.\u201d\n\nIndiana is one of a handful of states that received permission to not follow some federal rules when expanding Medicaid coverage under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIndiana\u2019s permission runs through Jan. 31, 2018.\n\nOne of the conditions of such waivers is that the demonstration program be evaluated to see whether it\u2019s meeting the expected result. Indiana must submit an interim evaluation of the program by mid-2016.\n\nFor example, Indiana is testing whether requiring recipients to pay reduced monthly contributions if they use less health care will discourage unnecessary care.\n\nSuch aspect is based on high-deductible insurance plans with health savings accounts that are becoming increasingly common in private insurance coverage.\n\nBut Pence argues that the Urban Institute, one of the evaluators chosen by the federal government to assess Indiana\u2019s plan, has previously been skeptical of using the health savings account model for Medicaid recipients.\n\nIn a May report on alternative Medicaid programs issued by the Urban Institute and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the authors wrote that \u201cusing HSA principles in Medicaid seems dubious.\u201d The report also said that the health accounts are probably a weak deterrent to unnecessary care and the cost of administering the accounts could outweigh the benefits.\n\nJohn Holahan, one of the Urban Institute's researchers who wrote the report, said it pointed out both positive and negative aspects of alternative Medicaid programs that are worth exploring further.\n\nBut neither he, nor any of the other report authors, will be conducting the evaluation of Indiana\u2019s program, he said.\n\n\u201cWe can certainly be impartial evaluators and have done it many, many times,\u201d Holahan said of the institute\u2019s contract with HHS.\n\nPence also says it\u2019s extremely rare for the federal government to hire its own contractors to evaluate a Medicaid demonstration project.\n\nIndiana has already contracted with the Lewin Group, an independent consultant.\n\nHaving a second evaluation, Pence wrote, \u201chas the potential to create contentious outcomes which can impede fair, impartial, and empirical analysis of demonstration projections.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for Burwell said the secretary will respond directly to Pence.\n\nA spokeswoman for one of the advocacy groups that pushed hard for Pence to expand Medicaid said she\u2019s not concerned about anything an evaluation would find.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been very pleased with the rollout of HIP so far,\u201d said Caitlin Priest, director of policy and communication for Covering Kids and Families of Indiana. \u201cWe feel like anything that would turn up in an evaluation would be positive, or would give us constructive feedback about how to improve the program going forward.\u201d\n\nThe state says more than 355,000 Hoosiers are participating in the Healthy Indiana Plan, including 170,000 who were transferred from a pilot program and from Indiana\u2019s traditional Medicaid program.\n\nBefore the expansion, Indiana had one of the most restrictive programs. Other than pregnant women, parents generally could only earn up to 24 percent of poverty to quality for coverage. And childless adults without a disability were not eligible at all, unless they could get into a pilot version of HIP, which had been available for a limited number of Hoosiers since 2008.The 2010 Affordable Care Act expanded Medicaid eligibility to those earning up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level. That's about $16,243 for one person and $33,465 for a family of four.\n\nThe Supreme Court left the expansion decision up to states, and Pence said he would only participate if he could do it through HIP.\n\nParticipants in the approved version Pence called HIP 2.0 are required to make monthly contributions ranging from $1 to $25. A Hoosier in poverty who doesn't contribute is put in a \"basic\" plan that has fewer benefits and requires co-payments for care.\n\nThe state says nearly 70 percent of participants are making the monthly payments to give them better benefits. And nearly nine in 10 of those contributing monthly earn less than the poverty level.\n\nIndiana was the first state to get permission to bar some adults from re-enrolling for a period of time if they don\u2019t pay the monthly fees. Indiana also got approval to charge higher cost-sharing for non-emergency use of an emergency room and to make coverage effective when the first payment is made, instead of when a person applies.\n\nContact Maureen Groppe at mgroppe@gannett.com or follow her on Twitter: @mgroppe.\n\nAspects of Indiana's alternative Medicaid program that will be evaluated:\n\nWhether requiring participants to make monthly contributions to a health account that can be rolled over if not used for health care reduces the use of unnecessary care.\n\nWhether reducing required contributions for participants who receive preventive care services improves a participant's health and reduces overall health care costs.\n\nWhether the required monthly contributions affect enrollment and the use of preventive and other health care services.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://indy.st/1XKKTWj", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Gov.
