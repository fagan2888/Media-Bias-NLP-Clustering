How about the fact that signing up for health insurance through Healthcare.gov or any of the State-run insurance websites is likely to compound your chances of being targeted for an audit by the Internal Revenue Service?\n\nThanks to the Affordable Care Act\u2019s reliance on the IRS to enforce Americans\u2019 compliance with its insurance mandate, the agency has hired 2,000 additional agents to pore over individual filing statements. And, unlike IRS audits of the past, they will have access to more non-financial information about their targets than ever before \u2014 thanks to Obamacare.\n\nIn particular, qualifying for a government subsidy to bolster your insurance premium payments places you under significantly greater scrutiny. In a report released last month titled \u201c5 Ways The IRS Will Enter Your Life Under Obamacare,\u201d the Foundation for Government Accountability examined how Obamacare will introduce unprecedented government intrusions into Americans\u2019 private lives.\n\nHere\u2019s just a sampling:\n\nEnrolling in an exchange plan and taking the Obamacare tax credit leaves you even more vulnerable to an audit by a newly-empowered IRS. Similar high-dollar tax credits have resulted in a greater likelihood of being targeted for an IRS audit. For example, almost 70 percent of the families that have participated in the adoption tax credit have been subject to an IRS audit. These audits routinely last years and can be costly. The IRS\u2019s own national taxpayer advocate, Nina Olson, highlighted serious problems in how the IRS ran its audit process for the adoption credits. She also warned that the risk and harm to citizens as a result of that program will pale in comparison to the potential impact on your finances during administration of the ObamaCare tax credits. Ms. Olson has publicly stated that she is concerned the IRS will not be able to \u201cadminister the new health care credits and penalty taxes in a fair and compassionate way.\u201d\n\nContinuing with the adoption credit comparison, Olson predicted Obamacare will necessarily expand the size and scope of the IRS, if there\u2019s to be any hope the agency doesn\u2019t repeat previous mistakes in enforcing the adoption code.\n\n\u201c[T]he IRS\u2019 implementation of the expanded adoption credit does not bode well for its implementation of the premium tax credit\u2026.If the IRS does not take the time to learn from its adoption credit experience and be thoughtful about how it administers future refundable credits, it may face problems with the [Obamacare] Premium Tax Credit \u2014 including high examination rates \u2014 that will overwhelm IRS resources and severely burden taxpayers,\u201d she wrote.\n\nIf an actual IRS employee is that concerned about the agency\u2019s own ability to keep pace with Obamacare \u2014 to say nothing whatsoever of enrollees\u2019 actual concerns about privacy and security \u2014 it\u2019s no wonder the Foundation for Government Accountability advises potential enrollees to think twice.\n\n\u201cIndividuals must be fully aware of the relationship they are entering into with the IRS before they enroll in an exchange plan,\u201d the report concludes. \u201cTime will tell if the IRS\u2019s troubling history of implementing other tax credits will resurface under the massive health insurance tax credit program.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: If you have bought or tried to buy health insurance through the Obamacare exchange, we want to hear from you.
