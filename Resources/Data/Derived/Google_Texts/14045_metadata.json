And if he does, it figures to be long after the first round \u2013 with its guaranteed contacts \u2013 has come and gone.\n\nIt\u2019s a situation that had many questioning the junior forward\u2019s decision to leave North Carolina with one year of eligibility still remaining.\n\nAmong the most surprised when McAdoo made the announcement back in April was his now-former Tar Heel teammate Brice Johnson.\n\n\u201cI thought he was going to return and I\u2019d be able to play one more year with him,\u201d Johnson said during a summer session with the media Wednesday afternoon. \u201cHe had to do what he had to do and I wish him the best.\n\n\u201cIt was a little shocking because I thought he was going to be one of the ones to come back. But he didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nMcAdoo was UNC\u2019s second-leading scorer at 14.2 points per game while leading the team in rebounding at 6.8 per game.\n\nAs much as Johnson will miss playing along side his friend this season, the 6-foot-9 rising junior figures to benefit from McAdoo\u2019s early departure because of the opportunity it will allow him to move over to his natural power forward position.\n\nJohnson spent the better part of his first two college seasons playing as an undersized center.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sick of playing people that are 280 and 290 (pounds) all the time,\u201d said Johnson, who is still slender at 217 pounds, even after an offseason program designed to help him gain more weight. \u201cSomebody sent me an article about how me and Kennedy (Meeks) would be fighting for a position and I was like, um, I\u2019m not a five. I\u2019m a natural four.\n\n\u201cI had to go in there (as a center). I could hold my ground sometimes, but eventually when I get tired they\u2019re going to bully me over. I\u2019d rather play the four.\u201d\n\nJohnson averaged 10.3 points and 6.1 rebounds per game mostly off the bench as a sophomore in 2013-14. Although he made significant strides offensively as the season went on, he said he still has work to do with both his defense and consistency.\n\nHe also realizes that his newly expanded role will increase the amount pressure he\u2019ll be under to perform.\n\n\u201cIt means I have to be that person that steps up next year because I\u2019m one of the best scorers in the post on this team,\u201d he said. \u201cI just have to step up and be ready to play.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"app_id": 124987614282599}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9ff5\"", "article_summary": "Among the most surprised when McAdoo made the announcement back in April was his now-former Tar Heel teammate Brice Johnson.\n\u201cIt was a little shocking because I thought he was going to be one of the ones to come back.\nJohnson spent the better part of his first two college seasons playing as an undersized center.\nIt\u2019s a situation that had many questioning the junior forward\u2019s decision to leave North Carolina with one year of eligibility still remaining.\nAnd if he does, it figures to be long after the first round \u2013 with its guaranteed contacts \u2013 has come and gone."}
