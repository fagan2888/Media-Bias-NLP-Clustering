A pregnant giant Flemish rabbit named Dolly Parton is now back at Wheeler Historic Farm after disappearing Wednesday.

Like a magic hat trick, a large rabbit named Dolly Parton who disappeared from a Salt Lake County farm has suddenly reappeared.

KSL-TV of Salt Lake City reports Wheeler Historic Farm announced Dolly's return Sunday morning.

Employees at the working public farm discovered the rabbit missing around noon Wednesday. Murray police say the lock on Dolly's cage had been cut, leading investigators to believe the bunny-napping was premeditated.

Program coordinator Raegan Scharman said Sunday a farmer found Dolly hopping around in her cage. The rabbit appeared to be in good condition.

Farm officials say they don't know how or when she was returned. But they're thankful to whoever brought her back.

Dolly is one of three Flemish giant rabbits at the farm.
