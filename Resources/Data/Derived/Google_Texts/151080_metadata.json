But he\u2019s depicted it.\n\n\u201cCertain tribes, particularly the Muscogee (Creek), believe that certain people have the ability to turn themselves into owls. \u2026 It\u2019s the Five Civilized Tribes that mostly believe that. That\u2019s what he\u2019s doing here,\u201d Haney told the paper about the figure he sculpted, which was exhibited at the Red Earth Native American Cultural Festival on June 5 in Remington Park in Oklahoma City.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never had the experience, but I\u2019m assuming it would be pretty excruciating to go through that expression, that feeling, of this owl just kind of busting through the body,\u201d he said.\n\nHaney crafted the 2-foot-tall American Indian warrior that changes into a bird, which is called \u201cOwl Transformation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe most difficult thing for me about art is developing the concept. Once I get the concept, then the painting, sculpting, is easy. \u2026 The way I function and I see other artists, if we can see an image here, it goes down and travels down our fingertips and it creates in front of us what we have in here,\u201d he said, tapping his temple, according to the paper.\n\nThe former state legislator, and principal chief of the Seminole Nation of Oklahoma, was named Ambassador of the Year for the 28th annual festival. The honor goes to someone who has depicted positive images of American Indians. Natives and non-Natives have earned the title. Kevin Costner, Tony Hillerman and Billy Mills were past recipients.\n\nHaney\u2019s sculpting of \u201cThe Guardian,\u201d a 22-foot-tall bronze warrior that sits atop the Oklahoma State Capitol, is the 73-year-old\u2019s most recognized work.\n\n\u201c\u2018The Guardian\u2019 from start to finish took me 10 months \u2026 but with \u2018Chickasaw Horse and Warrior,\u2019 that was a whole different thing. I\u2019ve ridden horses and had some, but I\u2019d never really done anything like that. So it took me two full years to complete that project. And to me, that\u2019s the best project I have to date. I\u2019m looking forward to having better ones,\u201d Haney said.\n\nYou can read more about Haney\u2019s sculpting story at NewsOK.com.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Enoch Kelly Haney, Seminole/Creek, told The Oklahoman that he could not imagine what it would feel like for an owl to", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "rcjohnson", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/06/11/prolific-sculptor-honored-2014-red-earth-festival-155260", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/enoch_kelly_haney.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Prolific Sculptor Honored at 2014 Red Earth Festival"}, "dcterms.date": "2014-06-11T15:07-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/06/11/prolific-sculptor-honored-2014-red-earth-festival-155260", "dc": {"title": "Prolific Sculptor Honored at 2014 Red Earth Festival"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 2}, "dcterms.title": "Prolific Sculptor Honored at 2014 Red Earth Festival"}, "article_summary": "That\u2019s what he\u2019s doing here,\u201d Haney told the paper about the figure he sculpted, which was exhibited at the Red Earth Native American Cultural Festival on June 5 in Remington Park in Oklahoma City.\n\u201cCertain tribes, particularly the Muscogee (Creek), believe that certain people have the ability to turn themselves into owls.\nThe former state legislator, and principal chief of the Seminole Nation of Oklahoma, was named Ambassador of the Year for the 28th annual festival.\nHaney\u2019s sculpting of \u201cThe Guardian,\u201d a 22-foot-tall bronze warrior that sits atop the Oklahoma State Capitol, is the 73-year-old\u2019s most recognized work.\nEnoch Kelly Haney, Seminole/Creek, told The Oklahoman that he could not imagine what it would feel like for an owl to burst through a person\u2019s body."}
