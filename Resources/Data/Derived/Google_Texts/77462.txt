Del. Jeion Ward got spirited and repeated applause Monday when she announced to the House of Delegates that, "I am back."

Ward, a Hampton Democrat who has multiple sclerosis, missed last week's sessions with a flare up. She didn't miss any major floor votes. The legislature is just picking up steam, eight days now into session.

"Four years ago I stood here on this floor in about four-inch-high heel shoes and said, 'I may have MS, but MS shall never have me,'" Ward told the body, again to applause.

"My message is a little bit different this year," she said. "MS does whatever MS wants to do. But with the good health insurance that we have ... I have been able to receive what I need to pull myself through this flare up."

Ward, like many legislators, gets health insurance through her part-time job in the legislature. She has argued, many times, for the state to expand Medicaid to cover the working poor in Virginia, as contemplated in the Affordable Care Act.

General Assembly Republicans, of course, have blocked the move, citing cost concerns.

Ward said today is MS awareness day, and activists had planned to lobby the legislature in person. The snow precluded that, and their outreach effort has moved online, Ward said.

More than 2.3 million people around the world have MS, Ward said. In Virginia it's 12,000* - 12,001, including her, she said.

"All though MS did what it wanted to do last week, this week I am back," Ward said. "And I am going to do what I am supposed to do."

Ward's colleagues applauded again. As the sound died, Speaker of the House William Howell added a kicker.

"MS is messing with the wrong person," he told the chamber.
