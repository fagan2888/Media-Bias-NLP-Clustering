If so, then you\u2019re not alone. For years now, the Gallup polling firm has repeatedly concluded that a majority of Americans, sometimes as many as 85%, feel that Christmas has become too commercialized.\n\nNonetheless, Americans\u2019 yearly griping over the Christmas season\u2019s transformation from solemn observance of the birthday of Christ into an orgiastic sacrifice to the pagan retail gods hasn\u2019t exactly expunged commercialism from the season. Year after year, Christmastime provides an excuse for thousands of parka-clad citizens to pitch a post-Thanksgiving Black Friday tent on retail pavement in their materialistic quest to get their greasy digits on the latest crappily made electronic hardware put together in questionable conditions overseas.\n\nThe fear of Christmas\u2019 commercialization is also connected to concurrent fears that the holiday is being thoroughly secularized by angry hoards of lawsuit-wielding atheists, liberals and, apparently, Radio Shack. Catholics (but not all Catholics) and evangelicals alike fear that the commercialization of Christmas is a form of secularization that dilutes the holiday\u2019s Christian meanings. Hence, religious conservatives have turned their notion of a \u201cWar on Christmas\u201d into an annual ritual through which they can express their endlessly expanding persecution complex. The Fox News Network, a 24-hour media dispensary of white conservative outrage, has for years made the idea of a \u201cWar on Christmas\u201d an integral part of their attempt to score high ratings from lily-white reactionaries petrified by the thought of American culture shifting its focus away from \u201cLeave it to Beaver\u201d land. Heck, one of Fox News\u2019 former anchors, John Gibson, even wrote a book on the \u201cliberal plot\u201d to destroy Christmas (for a hearty laugh, read the book\u2019s Amazon reviews).\n\nNever one to miss the chance to part conservatives from their cash, former Fox News commentator, half-term governor of Alaska, and perennial punch line Sarah Palin recently published her own \u201cWar on Christmas\u201d screed, in which she defiantly reclaims Christmas\u2019 Christian heritage from the angry claws of a host of boilerplate boogeymen, especially atheists and liberals, who, according to Palin, are interchangeable. Palin\u2019s book is also available in a four-hour audio format read by the former governor herself, which should give U.S. agents at Guantanamo Bay a new tool to coax information out of would-be terrorists. Despite the heavy marketing campaign that accompanied Palin\u2019s book, it debuted to reviews as chilly as the winter air and flopped on release, suggesting that perhaps there yet remains some last shred of karma in the universe. Whether Palin recognizes the irony of complaining about the commercialization of Christmas while also trying to capitalize on that commercialization via book sales remains to be seen, but don\u2019t hold your breath.\n\nSo, has Christmas really been unmoored from its truly sacred origins and recast as a cash-register-feeding tribute to the gods of the marketplace? The short answer is \u201cno.\u201d In an American context, Christmas has always been a decidedly commercial holiday, and it was created as such by Americans who sought to reconcile paradoxical feelings that framed capitalism as a system that reduced human virtues to a series of vacuous commodity exchanges, but also facilitated the economic and social freedoms that eventually defined American culture.\n\nAs historian Stephen Nissenbaum writes in his book, \u201cThe Battle for Christmas: A Cultural History of America\u2019s Most Cherished Holiday,\u201d Christmas\u2019 commercial trappings date all the way back to the 1500s via old European traditions that cast the winter season as a time of excessive celebration and symbolic inversion of traditional social orders.\n\nIn agricultural societies, December was the only time of the year when fresh meat was available after the slaughter, and the lack of refrigeration meant that meat had to be consumed quickly. Meat consumption, when combined with the end-of-the year availability of alcohol, turned the Christmas season into a season of excess. \u201cChristmas was a season of \u2018misrule,'\u201d Nissenbaum writes, \u201ca time when ordinary behavioral restraint could be violated with impunity.\u201d Servants could act as masters and the rich would bow to the poor, and such \u201cmisrule\u201d and inversion of social orders entailed all types of debauchery, from binge-drinking, to gluttony, to sexual deviancy. It\u2019s no wonder that early American Puritans rejected Christmas as an anti-Christian, pagan-influenced, immoral booze-fest.\n\nThe association of Christmastime with \u201cexcess\u201d survived into the 19th century, an era that forever fused the Christmas season with excessive luxury via capitalist consumerism in the collective American psyche. As Nissenbaum notes, 19th-century Americans lived in a transitional time, during which old seasonal rhythms were losing their influence over social behavior. \u201cUrbanization and capitalism were liberating people from the constraints of an agricultural cycle and making larger quantities of goods available for more extended periods of time,\u201d Nissenbaum observes. But the memory of old seasonal rhythms, with their emphasis on excess and celebration, died hard, and these old memories helped assuage the fears of a growing 19th-century American middle class that capitalism would supplant traditional virtues of frugality and citizenship with the hollow calls of luxury and excess.\n\nIn the midst of the great 19th-century Market Revolution, buying luxury goods became more possible, but remained suspect among Americans who had not yet fully equated consumer capitalism with civic duty. But, as Nissenbaum describes:\n\nChristmas came to the rescue. For this was one time of the year when the lingering reluctance of middle-class Americans to purchase frivolous gifts for their children was overwhelmed by their equally lingering predisposition to abandon ordinary behavioral constraints. Christmas helped intensify and legitimize a commercial kind of consumerism.\n\nIn 19th century America, a new urban middle class developed along with a transformation within the American home. Domestic spheres became nurturing havens of refuge from the increasingly commercialized and heartless capitalist public marketplace. Yet, even as middle-class Americans criticized the growth of a consumer society, they couldn\u2019t escape the fact that it was that very society that gave them steady incomes and the purchasable middle-class comforts that turned homes into shelters from the commercial world.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Christmas isn't under attack -- and it's always been commercial", "title": "The real history of the \u201cwar on Christmas\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Christmas isn't under attack -- and it's always been commercial", "title": "The real history of the \u201cwar on Christmas\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/12/24/the_real_history_of_the_war_on_christmas/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/11/palin_christmas.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Christmas isn't under attack -- and it's always been commercial", "title": "The real history of the \u201cwar on Christmas\u201d", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/11/palin_christmas.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Jarret Ruminski", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Christmas, Editor's Picks, History, War on Christmas", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd030\"", "article_summary": "Meat consumption, when combined with the end-of-the year availability of alcohol, turned the Christmas season into a season of excess.\nHence, religious conservatives have turned their notion of a \u201cWar on Christmas\u201d into an annual ritual through which they can express their endlessly expanding persecution complex.\nTopics: Christmas, Editor's Picks, History, War on Christmas, Life News, Politics NewsDo you ever feel that Christmas, the most celebrated and supposedly sacred holiday on the American calendar, has long since lost its spiritual core and become little more than a soulless annual sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord for the consumer capitalist giant?\nThe association of Christmastime with \u201cexcess\u201d survived into the 19th century, an era that forever fused the Christmas season with excessive luxury via capitalist consumerism in the collective American psyche.\nIt\u2019s no wonder that early American Puritans rejected Christmas as an anti-Christian, pagan-influenced, immoral booze-fest."}
