But if you go back just a little further in time, you can find Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., railing against then-President George W. Bush\u2019s Medicare Part D program, and sounding eerily familiar to today\u2019s Tea Party \u201cextremists:\u201d\n\nI think it\u2019s a complete embarrassment to the Bush administration to have a piece of legislation out there that is so confusing, they can\u2019t even explain it to anyone themselves.\n\nOh really? This from Nancy \u201cpass the bill to find out what\u2019s in it\u201d Pelosi?!\n\n\u2026 where the compliance of it is so difficult that they cannot help people to do it.\n\nMaybe if the Bush administration had put out a handy chart like the this one for Obamacare:\n\nThis chart on the functionality of Obamacare exchanges will make your head hurt. pic.twitter.com/GnjkoM69bL \u2014 Lachlan Markay (@lachlan) July 9, 2013\n\nPelosi continued:\n\nDemocrats want to replace it, they want to give an extension, so they are not penalized for not understanding something that\u2019s incomprehensible to even the Bush administration.\n\nBut didn\u2019t Nancy realize that once a bill is passed, \u201cIt\u2019s. The. Law.\u201d? Also replacing laws is racist, and extensions are definitely racist.\n\nAmazing how your words can come back to bite you in the Pelosi.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "title": "Flashback: Nancy Pelosi berates George W.
