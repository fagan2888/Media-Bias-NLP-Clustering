Gross domestic product has rebounded from a recession low of $14.4 trillion and should surpass $17 trillion for the first time this year. Even adjusting for inflation, GDP has grown by about $1.3 trillion, or roughly 9 percent, from 2009 to 2013. It grew at a healthy annual rate of 4.2 percent in the second quarter and economists generally expect more solid growth ahead.\n\nRelated: The Job Market\u2019s Hot Streak Is Over\u2026\n\nYet in poll after poll, many Americans say they don\u2019t think the recession ever ended, or that the economy has permanently changed for the worse. The two charts below, released today by the Census Bureau as part of its annual report on income, poverty and health insurance, go a long way toward explaining why. The real median household income last year was $51,939, about the same as in 2012 \u2014 and about 8 percent lower than it was in 2007. The recession began in December of that year.\n\nEven at the 95th percentile, real income is stagnant since the early 2000s. When families that close to the very top of the pyramid see no growth over the course of a decade, there is no wonder that the polls consistently show Americans dissatisfied with the U.S. economy.\n\nTop Read from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "It\u2019s been six years since Lehman Brothers collapsed into bankruptcy in the midst of th", "title": "Why So Many Americans Believe the Recession Never Ended", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/09/16/Heres-Why-So-Many-Americans-Believe-Recession-Never-Ended", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/09082014_Slow_Business_Snail_Money_Coins.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/09/16/Heres-Why-So-Many-Americans-Believe-Recession-Never-Ended", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/09082014_Slow_Business_Snail_Money_Coins.jpg", "creator": "@yuvalrosenberg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "It\u2019s been six years since Lehman Brothers collapsed into bankruptcy in the midst of th", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdba4b\"", "article_summary": "Even at the 95th percentile, real income is stagnant since the early 2000s.\nRelated: The Job Market\u2019s Hot Streak Is Over\u2026Yet in poll after poll, many Americans say they don\u2019t think the recession ever ended, or that the economy has permanently changed for the worse.\nGross domestic product has rebounded from a recession low of $14.4 trillion and should surpass $17 trillion for the first time this year.\nIt\u2019s been more than five years since the U.S. officially emerged from the Great Recession.\nEven adjusting for inflation, GDP has grown by about $1.3 trillion, or roughly 9 percent, from 2009 to 2013."}
