The Hauppauge, New York-based target has three manufacturing facilities.

The two targets have a combined revenue of about $225 miilion, for the 12 months ended June 30.\n\nPharmaceutical companies have been going after generic drug manufacturers so they can keep their pipelines fresh and keep up with competition. For instance, earlier in September, Lannett Co. said it will acquire Kremers Urban Pharmaceuticals Inc., the U.S. generics unit of Belgian drugmaker UCB SA, for about $1.2 billion.\n\nBarclays plc (NYSE: BCS) and Hughes Hubbard & Reed LLP are advising Mumbai, India-based Cipla.
