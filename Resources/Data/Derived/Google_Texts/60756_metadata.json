Second, it would reflect a restrained conception of the judicial role, respecting statutory language rather than legislating from the bench.\n\nThe case, King v. Burwell, concerns the availability of insurance subsidies in the 34 states that opted for federally run insurance exchanges rather than setting up their own. A subsection outlining how to calculate these subsidies refers to an \u201cexchange established by the state.\u201d\n\nThus, the argument of those out to destroy the law: If Congress wanted to subsidize customers in federal exchanges, it would have done that. So, for a statutory strict constructionist, case closed.\n\nNot so fast.\n\nI\u2019ll dispense with the statutory interpretation issue first, and take guidance from Justice Antonin Scalia, an undoubted conservative, who literally wrote the book on statutory interpretation.\n\nScalia\u2019s approach is termed \u201ctextualist,\u201d in contrast to the loosey-goosier \u201cpurposivist\u201d method of those who see the court\u2019s role as reading a statute in light of its underlying legislative intent. A purposivist would have no trouble deciding this case: The Affordable Care Act is designed to cover as many uninsured as possible.\n\nBut a good textualist would rule for the government, too, looking solely to the structure and language of the law. First, \u201cit is a fundamental canon of statutory construction that the words of a statute must be read in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme.\u201d\n\nThat language comes from the Supreme Court\u2019s 2000 ruling rejecting the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s bid to regulate tobacco. It was written by then-Justice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor, and joined by Justices Scalia, Anthony Kennedy and Clarence Thomas. (Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito weren\u2019t yet serving.)\n\nIn the ACA case, the text must be read in the context of other provisions that would be rendered absurd if subsidies were limited to state-operated exchanges.\n\nTo take one example: No one could buy insurance on federal exchanges because the statute defines an individual \u201cqualified\u201d to purchase as one who \u201cresides in the state that established the exchange.\u201d\n\nSo under the challengers\u2019 reading, Congress would have taken the trouble to establish exchanges not only doomed to fail, because of the unavailability of subsidies, but that would have no customers at all.\n\nA second rule of statutory construction is that Congress \u201cdoes not alter the fundamental details of a regulatory scheme in vague terms or ancillary provisions \u2014 it does not, one might say, hide elephants in mouseholes.\u201d That comes from a 2001 Scalia opinion, joined by Kennedy and Thomas.\n\nIn this case, according to the challengers, Congress hid quite an elephant \u2014 a provision that even they agree would gut the law \u2014 in a five-word mousehole.\n\nWhich brings me to the states\u2019-rights issue that, for conservatives, should be even more compelling. The ACA created federal exchanges as the states\u2019 backup plan, respecting states\u2019 rights to choose.\n\nUnder the challengers\u2019 reading, this federalist flexibility would be transformed into federal punishment: Citizens of states that failed to establish exchanges would be deprived of subsidies, sending the federal exchanges into a death spiral. Individual insurance markets in those states would collapse, too, because other provisions in the law \u2014 such as requiring insurers to cover preexisting conditions \u2014 would still apply, driving sicker people into those markets and premium costs up.\n\nAll without any warning to states that these consequences were coming. The prospect that subsidies would not be available on state exchanges never arose during congressional debate. If Congress really intended to hammer states that failed to set up exchanges, would it have hidden its threat in an obscure subsection?\n\nIt\u2019s indisputable that states were blindsided by this possibility. \u201cRegardless of who runs the exchange, the end product is the same,\u201d said Ohio Gov. John Kasich, a Republican. By \u201crefusing to implement state-based exchanges, the state is ceding nothing,\u201d said South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, also a Republican.\n\nInterpreting the law to bar subsidies would embody the judicial activism the conservatives repeatedly disavow, elevating policy antipathy to the health-care law over settled legal principles.\n\nRead more from Ruth Marcus\u2019s archive, follow her on Twitter or subscribe to her updates on Facebook.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Supreme Court conservatives should evaluate the whole law.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/ruthmarcus", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Supreme Court conservatives should evaluate the whole law.", "title": "Context is key", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/in-aca-case-context-is-key/2015/02/27/dd2bb786-beaa-11e4-8668-4e7ba8439ca6_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/02/27/Editorial-Opinion/Images/Supreme_Court_Citizens_United-00272.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@RuthMarcus"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/in-aca-case-context-is-key/2015/02/27/dd2bb786-beaa-11e4-8668-4e7ba8439ca6_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Ruth Marcus, Ruth Marcus column, ruth marcus washington post, affordable care act, obamacare, burwell v king, state exchanges, supreme court state exchanges,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/ruthmarcus"}, "eomportal-uuid": "dd2bb786-beaa-11e4-8668-4e7ba8439ca6", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Ruth Marcus, Ruth Marcus column, ruth marcus washington post, affordable care act, obamacare, burwell v king, state exchanges, supreme court state exchanges,"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2337\"", "article_summary": "A purposivist would have no trouble deciding this case: The Affordable Care Act is designed to cover as many uninsured as possible.\nThe case, King v.
