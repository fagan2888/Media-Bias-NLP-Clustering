Already.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge season,\u201d Harris said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it because other people are saying it. I just think it\u2019s going to be a huge season for myself personally, just for me.\u201d\n\nAs odd as it sounds for a player in only his second year, this season could color how Harris is viewed for the rest of his career. The Nuggets are in search of a long-term solution at shooting guard. They drafted Harris in 2014 in the first round with the intent of watching him grow into that role. And after one year on the job, they need him to show he is that guy.\n\nWhat\u2019s not entirely fair to Harris is the urgency of the situation, although some of this is simply part of a professional basketball player\u2019s life. The former Michigan State star could not get a foothold during his rookie season mostly because he just wasn\u2019t afforded consistent playing time. Even new Nuggets coach Michael Malone could see that immediately after he was hired.\n\n\u201cGary Harris is coming back as a second-year player, but in my mind I call him a rookie because he never got a chance to really get comfortable and play consistent minutes,\u201d Malone said. \u201cSo, I don\u2019t think any of us know really who Gary Harris is and what kind of NBA player he is. So we\u2019re going to give him that opportunity this year.\u201d\n\nHarris entered the NBA with the reputation as a perimeter defensive stopper who also could score. He showed flashes of both during his rookie season, but playing an average of just over 13 minutes in 55 games wasn\u2019t enough time for him to get into a rhythm, and it certainly didn\u2019t help his confidence. Harris struggled to get out of an early shooting slump and finished his rookie season wanting to show more.\n\nHe\u2019s getting a chance to do that now. Malone played him 29 minutes in the Nuggets\u2019 preseason opener against the Los Angeles Clippers, and Harris responded with 11 points on 4-of-8 shooting from the field. And,as is his trademark, Harris excelled defensively with four steals in the contest.\n\n\u201cReally not getting much playing time last year, and not really being able to produce and help the team like I wanted to, I want to really go out there and make it a great season for myself and the team and just continue to build confidence,\u201d Harris said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be fun just going out there and getting more playing time, just being able to go out there and play.\u201d\n\nOne of the only true competition situations on the team during training camp is at shooting guard. Veteran sharpshooter Randy Foye has been the steady starter in recent years, but Harris will be given every opportunity to earn the job.\n\n\u201cCompetition is healthy,\u201d Malone said. \u201cI love when you go into a camp and people are fighting for jobs. It\u2019s not personal. But it\u2019s Randy\u2019s responsibility to push himself and make Gary better, and it\u2019s Gary\u2019s responsibility to push himself and make Randy better.\u201d\n\nMostly, though, Harris wants everyone to actually see the real him.\n\n\u201cYeah, for sure,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel like there\u2019s a lot to offer, you know?\u201d\n\nChristopher Dempsey: cdempsey@denverpost.com or @dempseypost", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Nuggets guard Gary Harris in line for more playing time this season", "title": "Nuggets guard Gary Harris in line for more playing time this season", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/10/04/nuggets-guard-gary-harris-in-line-for-more-playing-time-this-season/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151004_072721_bkn-gary-harris.jpg", "height": 458}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151004_072721_bkn-gary-harris.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-04T19:08:54+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T04:46:08+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cIt\u2019s a huge season,\u201d Harris said.\nThe former Michigan State star could not get a foothold during his rookie season mostly because he just wasn\u2019t afforded consistent playing time.\nHarris struggled to get out of an early shooting slump and finished his rookie season wanting to show more.\n\u201cSo, I don\u2019t think any of us know really who Gary Harris is and what kind of NBA player he is.\n\u2014 this is the biggest season of Harris\u2019 NBA career."}
