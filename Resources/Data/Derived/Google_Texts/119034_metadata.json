It\u2019s a recovery that made it to the headlines but bypassed their wallets, with wages stagnant and disposable income effectively fallen thanks to increases in the cost of living.\n\nIt\u2019s a problem felt across almost the entire economy, frustrating workers and dragging down businesses right as things are supposed to be getting better. In all of this, though, there is some good news.\n\nOne industry appears to be working. It just isn\u2019t one anyone knew about.\n\nAccording to Brookings economist Mark Muro, wages have gone up for workers in he calls the \u201cadvanced industries,\u201d a sector of the economy that didn\u2019t exist as its own category until Muro and his colleague Jonathan Rothwell created it in their recent study. Advanced industries include a cross section of manufacturing, energy and service sector companies, Munro explained, that all share one common trend: they focus on research and development.\n\nTo qualify for \"advanced industries,\" Muro and Rothwell created two main criteria. A company has to have above average research spending per worker, at least in the 80th percentile or higher nationwide, and at least 21% of the workforce must need some level of Science, Technology, Engineering or Math (STEM) knowledge\n\nIn fact, it was by studying STEM workers that the two economists accidentally discovered the link between research and wage growth.", "article_metadata": {"layout": "main", "description": "Although the economy remains disappointing for most Americans workers in this one sector are not only doing well, they're better than ever.", "author": "Eric Reed", "og": {"site_name": "MainStreet", "description": "Although the economy remains disappointing for most Americans workers in this one sector are not only doing well, they're better than ever.", "title": "The One Job Sector That Works: Among Stagnant Wages, This Sector Is Actually Doing Great", "url": "https://www.mainstreet.com/article/the-one-job-sector-that-works-among-stagnant-wages-this-sector-is-actually-doing-great", "image": {"width": 600, "secure_url": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/wagesigns.jpg", "identifier": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/wagesigns.jpg", "height": 400}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "section": "Financial Planning", "keywords": "wages, pay, salary, recovery, inequality, STEM, advanced industries, personal finance", "fb": {"app_id": 925400040808836}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MainStreet", "section": "Financial Planning", "tag": "personal finance", "published_time": "2015-04-07T07:00Z", "author": "https://www.mainstreet.com/author/1611368"}, "date": "2015-04-07T07:00Z", "contentType": "article", "guid": 13098114, "twitter": {"description": "Although the economy remains disappointing for most Americans workers in this one sector are not only doing well, they're better than ever.", "title": "The One Job Sector That Works: Among Stagnant Wages, This Sector Is Actually Doing Great", "url": "https://www.mainstreet.com/article/the-one-job-sector-that-works-among-stagnant-wages-this-sector-is-actually-doing-great", "image": {"src": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/wagesigns.jpg", "identifier": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/wagesigns.jpg"}, "site": "@mainstr", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "wages, pay, salary, recovery, inequality, STEM, advanced industries, personal finance"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd37fd\"", "article_summary": "To qualify for \"advanced industries,\" Muro and Rothwell created two main criteria.\nAdvanced industries include a cross section of manufacturing, energy and service sector companies, Munro explained, that all share one common trend: they focus on research and development.\nIt\u2019s a recovery that made it to the headlines but bypassed their wallets, with wages stagnant and disposable income effectively fallen thanks to increases in the cost of living.\nIt\u2019s a problem felt across almost the entire economy, frustrating workers and dragging down businesses right as things are supposed to be getting better.\nAccording to Brookings economist Mark Muro, wages have gone up for workers in he calls the \u201cadvanced industries,\u201d a sector of the economy that didn\u2019t exist as its own category until Muro and his colleague Jonathan Rothwell created it in their recent study."}
