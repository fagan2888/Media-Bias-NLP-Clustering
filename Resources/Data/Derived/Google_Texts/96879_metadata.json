In February, for instance, he said his struggles with state employee unions had prepared him to take on Islamic State.\n\nWhen he entered the race in July, however, he was polling strong in Iowa, which holds the first nominating contest. His Midwestern roots and his family's religious ties made him a favorite.\n\nBy Sunday, after a lackluster performance in two debates, his support had plummeted to zero in a CNN/ORC poll. His fundraising had tanked too.\n\nHere are three areas where Walker stumbled.\n\nHis entrance into the race\n\nWalker entered the 2016 campaign under a spotlight no candidate would enjoy -- a public tiff with his family.\n\nWhen the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in June that same-sex couples had a constitutional right to marry, Walker objected.\n\n\u201cI believe this Supreme Court decision is a grave mistake,\u201d he said.\n\nThe next day, Walker toned down his comments, noting that the high court's ruling was the law of the land.\n\nBut the damage was done, casting Walker not as a moderate but as one pandering to the far right.\n\nWeeks later, as Walker prepared to declare his candidacy, his sons Matt, 21, and Alex, 20, told CNN they disagreed with his stance on gay marriage. Their mother had foreshadowed the family divide in an interview with the Washington Post.\n\n\u201cThat was a hard one,\u201d Tonette Walker had told the Post. \"Our sons were disappointed.... I was torn. I have children who are very passionate [in favor of same-sex marriage], and Scott was on his side very passionate.\u201d\n\nBirthright citizenship must end\n\nTrump, the billionaire businessman and front-runner for the GOP presidential nomination, brought the issue to the fore earlier this summer when he unveiled his immigration plan.\n\nSeveral GOP hopefuls objected that ending birthright citizenship would require a constitutional amendment.\n\nBut Walker sided with Trump, who contends that a simple act of Congress would be enough to ensure that children born to mothers in the U.S. illegally would not be American citizens.\n\nThat wasn't the end of Walker's debate with himself, however. He flipped back and forth on the issue several times until eventually deciding he did not support ending birthright citizenship.\n\nMany political observers viewed his shifting stances as amateurish. Questions began to rise about Walker's candidacy and whether he was ready for the national spotlight.\n\nBuild a wall along the U.S.-Canada border?\n\nWalker said New Hampshire voters had asked him about putting up a wall at the Canadian border, and he was open to the idea.\n\nHis comment set off ridicule and raised eyebrows among Democrats and Republicans alike. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky called it a \u201cdumb\u201d idea. The Canadian Embassy in Washington issued a statement of objection.\n\nTo Republicans, securing the U.S.-Mexico border is vital for immigration reform, but the Canadian border doesn't inspire the same level of anxiety.\n\nWalker ultimately was the odd man out on the issue, and soon backed down.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Trump threatens to sue conservative group over attack ads", "Description": "More from Trail Guide Dec. 10 Donald Trump backs out of his Israel trip Dec. 9 Some U.S. mayors want Donald Trump to stay out of their cities Dec. 8 Hillary Clinton looks to tie GOP candidates to Trump's rhetoric about Muslims Dec. 7 Presidential rivals denounce Donald Trump's call to ban Muslims...", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "More from Trail Guide Dec. 10 Donald Trump backs out of his Israel trip Dec. 9 Some U.S. mayors want Donald Trump to stay out of their cities Dec. 8 Hillary Clinton looks to tie GOP candidates to Trump's rhetoric about Muslims Dec. 7 Presidential rivals denounce Donald Trump's call to ban Muslims...", "title": "Trump threatens to sue conservative group over attack ads", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/trailguide/la-na-trailguide-09222015-htmlstory.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5601bb30/turbine/la-na-trailguide-09222015", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp15.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index,follow", "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2015-09-22", "y_key": "cee2fe4077f8d050", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "googlebot": "index"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2b26\"", "article_summary": "To Republicans, securing the U.S.-Mexico border is vital for immigration reform, but the Canadian border doesn't inspire the same level of anxiety.\nQuestions began to rise about Walker's candidacy and whether he was ready for the national spotlight.\nWalker said New Hampshire voters had asked him about putting up a wall at the Canadian border, and he was open to the idea.\nWhen he entered the race in July, however, he was polling strong in Iowa, which holds the first nominating contest.\nBy Sunday, after a lackluster performance in two debates, his support had plummeted to zero in a CNN/ORC poll."}
