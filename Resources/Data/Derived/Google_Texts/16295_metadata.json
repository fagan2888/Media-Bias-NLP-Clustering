HHS' Office for Civil Rights (OCR) also has been enforcing civil rights laws by barring discrimination based on race, color, national origin, disability or age.\n\nThe OCR already has been accepting civil rights complaints(www.hhs.gov) under the ACA, and the proposed rule makes it clear that individuals can seek legal remedies for discrimination under Section 1557.\n\nIn addition to health insurance marketplaces, the proposed rule applies to any health program that HHS administers directly, as well as to any health program, activity or entity that receives HHS funding, such as hospitals that accept Medicare patients or physicians who treat Medicaid patients.\n\nHighlights of the Proposed Rule\n\n\n\nThe proposed rule implements a number of new protections, including a directive that women and men must be treated equally in the health care they receive. Other provisions of the ACA bar certain types of sex discrimination in insurance by, for example, prohibiting women from being charged more than men for coverage.\n\nThe proposal also states that individuals must not be subjected to discrimination based on gender identity. For example, some insurance policies have historically contained categorical exclusions on coverage of all care related to gender transition, but those exclusions would be prohibited under the proposed rule. Individuals also must be treated in a manner consistent with their gender identity, including in access to facilities.\n\nIn addition, the rule states that all covered entities need to provide patients who have limited English proficiency tools that allow effective two-way communication of health information, such as written translations, language services or oral interpreters.\n\nFor individuals with disabilities, the proposed rule contains requirements for the provision of auxiliary aids and services, including alternative formats and sign language interpreters, and the accessibility of programs offered through electronic and information technology.\n\nOpen for Public Comment\n\n\n\nHHS has requested comment(www.regulations.gov) on how a final rule can incorporate the most robust set of protections against discrimination that will be supported by the courts on an ongoing basis.\n\nThe proposed rule also requests comment on whether Section 1557 should include an exemption for religious organizations and what the scope of any such exemption should be. However, nothing in the proposed rule would affect the application of existing protections for religious beliefs and practices, such as provider conscience laws and the regulations issued under the ACA related to preventive health services.\n\nComments on the proposed rule will be accepted through Nov. 9, and the OCR will consider these comments as it drafts its final rule to implement Section 1557.\n\nRelated AAFP News Coverage\n\nAAFP Delegates Tackle Health Care Equity, CME Issues\n\n(10/24/2014)\n\nMore From AAFP\n\nAmerican Family Physician: AFP by Topic: Care of Special Populations\n\n\n\nPolicy on Patient Discrimination\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "AAFP News", "description": "Earlier this month, HHS issued a proposed rule intended to provide populations vulnerable to discrimination equal access to health care and health care coverage.", "pubdate": "2015-09-23", "author": "News Staff", "og": {"image": "http://www.aafp.org/content/dam/AAFP/images/logos_internal/og/AAFP-capital-RGB2_1024x512B.png", "description": "Earlier this month, HHS issued a proposed rule intended to provide populations vulnerable to discrimination equal access to health care and health care coverage.", "title": "HHS Looks to Advance Health Equity Through ACA"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.aafp.org/content/dam/AAFP/images/ann/2015-September/HHS-Proposed-rule_Health-Equity-sign.jpg", "description": "Earlier this month, HHS issued a proposed rule intended to provide populations vulnerable to discrimination equal access to health care and health care coverage.", "site": "@aafp", "card": "summary", "title": "HHS Looks to Advance Health Equity Through ACA"}, "lastreviewdate": "2015-09-23", "news-category": "Government & Medicine", "nav-title": "HHS Looks to Advance Health Equity Through ACA", "image": "http://www.aafp.org/content/dam/AAFP/images/ann/2015-September/HHS-Proposed-rule_Health-Equity-sign.jpg.daijpg.90.jpg", "keywords": "HHS health equity, Health Insurance Marketplace, Affordable Care Act, ACA, civil rights", "content-type": "news-article", "archive": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "subcategory": "Government & Medicine"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca337\"", "article_summary": "Earlier this month, HHS issued a proposed rule titled \"Nondiscrimination in Health Programs and Activities\"(www.federalregister.gov) that aims to advance health equity and reduce disparities in health care by providing populations vulnerable to discrimination equal access to health care and health care coverage.\n(www.hhs.gov) \"This is another example of this administration's commitment to giving every American access to the health care they deserve.\"\nRelated AAFP News CoverageAAFP Delegates Tackle Health Care Equity, CME Issues(10/24/2014)More From AAFPAmerican Family Physician: AFP by Topic: Care of Special PopulationsPolicy on Patient Discrimination\nSection 1557 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) enacted in 2010 extended civil rights protections banning discrimination based on gender to health programs and activities.\nComments on the proposed rule will be accepted through Nov. 9, and the OCR will consider these comments as it drafts its final rule to implement Section 1557."}
