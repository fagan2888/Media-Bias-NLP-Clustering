How would you feel if half the tax dollars you paid the federal government each year were thrown away? That's essentially what happens when approximately $750 billion (or more) is spent every year on waste, fraud and abuse. The number includes taxes that aren't collected--and should be--to September spending sprees by federal agencies that are desperate to spend their full budgets before the end of their fiscal year.

Just imagine what the country could do with just half of that money every year:

Overspending on poorly negotiated federal contracts is also part of the problem, since the federal workforce largely depends on private contractors. One of the most egregious examples is the Defense Department, which has never been audited. The military is good at fighting wars, but it sucks at managing money.

The DOD's convolulted bookkeeping system is their excuse. (Haven't they heard of Quick Books?) As a result, the Pentagon hasn't accounted for more than $8.5 trillion taxpayer dollars doled out by Congress since 1996. Yet they still want more money added to their nearly $600 billion budget.

Anyway, you get the picture. Waste not, want not.

The following chart is from 2013. The government hasn't done much--if anything--to reduce these numbers.
