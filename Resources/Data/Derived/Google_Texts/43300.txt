Not even broken Easter eggs escape volunteers' scrutiny

Longmont's Clean Up, Green Up campaign celebrated 20 years today with a launch of this year's annual beautification initiative under sunny skies.

Dozens of people old and young turned out, equipping themselves with 35-gallon orange bags for trash, and clear for materials suitable for recycling.

This citywide clean up, whose organizers hope inspires cleanup efforts all year, will take place through April 30.

Participants met for today's kickoff at 7 S. Sunset St., with enthusiasm to match the cooperating weather. Coffee, orange juice and donuts were provided to fuel their labors.

Those pitching in were urged to choose a park, bike path, street, alley, open space or a section of the St. Vrain Greenway to spruce up. For those undecided, an area can be assigned to individuals or a group.

At Price Park, one volunteer was seen even picking up shards of broken Easter eggs left over from recent festivities there.
