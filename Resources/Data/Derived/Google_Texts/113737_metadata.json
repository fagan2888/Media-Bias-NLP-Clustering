If a Muslim woman wants to wear a veil, she should be able to. In the same way, if a Catholic wants to wear a cross. Everyone should be able to profess his faith\u2013not outside the culture, but at the very heart of the culture.\u201d\n\nEven in the case of legislation allowing such things as euthanasia or same-sex marriage, Francis said, people of faith should be able to opt out, without suffering negative repercussions.\n\nAsked about these specific cases, Francis argued that they should come as a result of the democratic process. Once a law has been voted in by the people, he said, the State should still \u201crespect the consciences\u201d of citizens. \u201cIn every juridical structure,\u201d he maintained, \u201cconscientious objection should be present, since it is a human right.\u201d\n\nIn case there should be any doubt, he added that \u201cthis is also true for a government official, who is a human person as well.\u201d\n\nSumming up, the Pope declared that such a state would be living a \u201ctrue secularity.\u201d It\u2019s not right to disparage or discount the opinions of religious people in society, he said, just because they are \u201cgrounded in Christian thought.\u201d\n\nIn this regard, the Pope addressed the situation of France, noting that the one criticism he would offer is that the country tends to \u201cexaggerate its secularism [la\u00efcit\u00e9].\u201d\n\n\u201cThis comes from a way of considering religions as a sub-culture rather than an integral part of culture. I fear that this approach, which is the offspring of the Enlightenment, endures to this day,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cFrance must take a step forward in this regard and accept that openness to transcendence is a right for everyone,\u201d he said.\n\nFollow Thomas D.
