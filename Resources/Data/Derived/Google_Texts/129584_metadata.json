I say casual because the latest edition promises a more streamlined experience for new players and play sessions that are meant to last as long as the average American lunch hour (around 30 minutes).\n\nA lot has changed since the 2012 edition of the game, including the way it will be delivered to the masses, how it models some pretty important political activities, and when it will ultimately be made available to the public. We also talk about what\u2019s changed in the 2016 edition, the current political field, and Donald Trump\u2019s hair. Sit back and enjoy my conversation with Wardell about Political Machine 2016 \u2013 one of the few (only?) games about the upcoming U.S. presidential election.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about this new game \u2013 just for the record, what\u2019s the official title?\n\nBrad Wardell: It\u2019s called The Political Machine 2016.\n\nThe last addition was Political Machine 2012, right?\n\nWardell: Right.\n\nHow do you think the issues have changed since the last game \u2013 the important issues voters care about \u2013 are they the same or have they changed dramatically?\n\nWardell: They are quite a bit different this time. When you have don\u2019t have an incumbent everything kind of goes up in the air. Last time tax cuts and Obamacare were the major issues; this time we\u2019ve got ISIS going on in the Middle East, you\u2019ve got the Ukraine issue, you have gun control (from a video game standpoint all this stuff is really good) the issue of equal pay for women in the workplace, etc. So all of this has kind of come to the forefront rather than the tame issues like social security reform, etc. From an entertainment or video game point of view, this election\u2019s issues are a little bit more interesting.\n\nDo you think stuff like \u201csame sex marriage\u201d is off the table?\n\nWardell: No I don\u2019t think so \u2013 it\u2019s in the game. I mean, we don\u2019t choose. Our job is to model the real world as closely as we can and try to be as fair as we can to all the candidates \u2013 which is tough, because everyone thinks we\u2019re picking on their candidate but we\u2019re just tackling the issues as best we can from as many sources as we can to try and be accurate and make sure people have a good time playing the game.\n\nHow many candidates are in the 2016 edition?\n\nWardell: We have every (even minor) candidate this time. You saw Elizabeth Warren in there [referring to a screenshot from the game that Stardock shared with us last week \u2013 you can see it again here] \u2013 even though she\u2019s not running \u2013 across the line. Whether they are fairly minor Democratic governors or even a candidate like Scott Walker who has already dropped out\u2026 they are all in the game, and you can, of course make your own candidates from scratch yourself\u2026 if you want to run as yourself and pick where your strengths and weaknesses are, you can do that as well.\n\nCan you create your own party this time around?\n\nWardell: No you still have to choose \u2013 and this always comes up \u2013 as people want to run as an Independent; we had to decide if we either have a game that has some bearing on the real-world [of politics] or we are making a fantasy game. We think that more people are interested in playing something that feels like the real world.\n\nWhat are some of the new gameplay elements that are in Political Machine 2016?\n\nWardell: The big thing this time (and there a couple of other new features) \u2013 and it\u2019s something we learned from watching the previous election \u2013 is that we now have random events that can alter the election. Remember when McCain and Obama were running and we had the financial meltdown right during the middle of the election season? That changed everything when they had to deal with that. Unfortunately in Political Machine we didn\u2019t have time to implement that sort of thing\u2026 we really wanted to but we just didn\u2019t have the budget. So this time we said \u201cwe really need to have this.\u201d So if there\u2019s a terrorist attack, or some other thing that might happen (even if it\u2019s not likely to happen) we need to have them in there. So we have all these unlikely random events. We have random events like \u201cthe Russians starting to move trips into Estonia,\u201d or an \u201cairstrike on Turkey,\u201d a particular scandal happening, or a financial meltdown, Riots, etc., that can become a major issue. We would have never predicted that immigration would become a major issue of this campaign. You know, Donald Trump\u2019s come in and he\u2019s really hot on illegal immigration, so we wanted to make a game where players had to respond to these special random events or issues that pop up from game-to-game.\n\nAre these frequent or are they pretty rare events?\n\nWardell: You\u2019ll typically get at least one per game but you\u2019re not likely to get multiple random events per game. It\u2019s pretty likely you\u2019ll get one, it\u2019s unlikely you\u2019ll get two, and it\u2019s almost impossible you\u2019ll get three.\n\nYeah, because (I would assume) these have a major effect on gameplay.\n\nWardell: Exactly. and you might even play a couple of games and not get any. The whole point is that they are not \u201cfor sure.\u201d\n\nSo what are some of the other new bells and whistles?\n\nWardell: We\u2019ve changed a lot of the visuals and it\u2019s a little more esoteric but a little more satisfying to the player\u2026 and we\u2019ve changed the way the political operatives work. Also, before you could get endorsements and once you were done with all the endorsements you just had all of this political capital and you could do nothing and kind of just \u201chung in there.\u201d This time around you can use political capital to continue to get minor endorsements, which improve your [candidate\u2019s] awareness. It\u2019s a better way to model real-world late-game \u201cget-out-the-vote\u201d campaigns. We didn\u2019t previously model \u201cget-out-the-vote\u201d campaigns in our games and this time around we are actually implementing that. They call it the \u201cground game\u201d in politics and when we first started designing the game we didn\u2019t think about the importance of it.\n\nYeah because it\u2019s pretty important.\n\nWardell: Yeah, it\u2019s kind of weird.. like twenty years ago you didn\u2019t hear about \u201cthe ground game\u201d and \u201cthey are getting their voters out\u201d but in the last election it was a pretty big deal. Remember after the last election how they were talking about how bad Mitt Romney\u2019s mechanism for getting his volunteers to get out the vote was? And so that was one of those things where we wanted to go back and model that better because this needs to be an important part of the game now. One of the other areas we focused on this time around is the multiplayer\u2026 by integrating it more closely into Steam we\u2019ve made it so you can invite your friends into the game and get games going very quickly because a given game of Political Machine 2016 only lasts like 30 minutes.\n\nIs multiplayer turn-based or real-time?\n\nWardell: Well, it\u2019s simultaneous turns so you and your opponent are always moving \u2013 as a result there\u2019s almost no time when you\u2019re not doing \u201csomething.\u201d\n\nOne of the things I wanted to ask you about was how outside money is playing a real role in politics now, having a major influence. Do you have any of that playing a role in the game?\n\nWardell: That comes up in the random events. Essentially what happens is you can raise money but the more money you raise, you are basically rolling the dice on whether or not it\u2019s going to create a scandal.\n\nSo give me an example of how that would work in the game.\n\nWardell: Let\u2019s say you keep going to the same place; because what you did traditionally was you\u2019d keep going to places like California and raise money endlessly because that is where most of the money is. Now the more you raise money in a given state, the more likely the odds are that you\u2019ll get a scandal. What happens is a scandal comes on the game screen and it says \u201cso and so caught receiving laundered money from foreign donors\u201d or from some other source and that can then affect your credibility and trustworthiness across the board, which is very damaging in the game. On the other hand, if you don\u2019t take out money you can\u2019t do things like take out ads\u2026\n\nSo there\u2019s not an element to represent Super PACs controlled by someone like the Koch brothers in the game?\n\nWardell: There\u2019s not a mechanic for that because we\u2019re not sure how it would play into game.. it\u2019s one of those things that comes up as an incident\u2026 what you get instead is the ability to hire operatives that can increase your money-making abilities. We don\u2019t model the negative aspect of outside money because unfortunately \u2013 you and I know this \u2013 there\u2019s isn\u2019t really a lot of punishment in the political system for these people. We talk about it but the candidates never pay a price. We have to be careful about wanting to put in an \u201caha moment\u201d where there\u2019s a negative for raising money or dealing with Super PACs because in reality they [candidates] aren\u2019t really paying a price in the real world.\n\nAnd the old argument is \u201cI\u2019m not connected to that Super PAC,\u201d so\u2026\n\nWardell: Exactly. We always say \u201cwhat about these 501(c)s? We need to model these 501(c)s.\u201d Okay, but what is the actual game impact, the actual election impact? The team making the game has had this discussion a lot. Someone says \u201cWell, you know, if you bring them in maybe it alienates the voters,\u201d and the response to that is \u201cWell, yes, but has that actually ever happened or is it just that you want that to happen?\u201d We\u2019ve been dying to find a way to use the 501(c)s in some way, and the way it has been thought of is (this came up the last time we were developing the game and this time too) \u201cWhat if we have Super PACs act as an almost independent agent in the game that are doing things on the player\u2019s behalf?\u201d But it\u2019s a 30 minute game and the problem is that it would tick players off if they lost the election because of something that was completely out of their control. \u201cWell, that\u2019s realistic,\u201d we could say but we ultimately say \u201cokay, but that\u2019s not fun.\u201d\n\nThe influence of outside money is realistic, though.. the infamous Willie Horton Ad is a good example, or the Swift Boat ads\u2013\n\nWardell: Yeah and that wasn\u2019t put out by Bush, that was put out by \u2013 they weren\u2019t PACs back then\u2013 by a third-party group.\n\nThose kinds of things definitely have an influence, but it is probably complicated to try and model that in the game and make it fun.\n\nWardell: That\u2019s why we came up with the random events, where you can have scandals etc. It would be nice if we could have those kinds of things attached to each candidate \u2014 and it\u2019s another thing we talked about during development \u2013 where each of the candidates could have baggage; so if, for example, you pick Hillary Clinton she has these baggage items.. but then \u2013 you could almost write about the \u201cpolitics of writing a political game\u201d because then how do you keep the partisanship of designers or even the appearance of it coming into play? I have had to deal with this already. One of the ratings on our candidates is intelligence and one of our designers had given Donald Trump a three out of ten. If we have Donald Trump rated as a three he is basically a moron. You\u2019ll find plenty of people who will say \u201cDonald Trump IS a moron\u201d but do you really think Donald Trump is that mentally handicapped? Imagine if we added in that Hillary Clinton has email scandals and Donald Trump has bankruptcies, and Carly Fiorina has her HP failures and on, and on, and on\u2026 Each of these candidates could have baggage, but which ones do we pick and if this comes up during play and these things come up randomly, are we being fair to all candidates at that point?\n\nSo are these things in the game now?\n\nWardell: No, they were in the game and then we took them out because we were constantly feeling like people would say we were picking on their favorite candidate in an unfair way because the way these things come out is completely random. In the build that had this stuff you could be playing Hillary Clinton three times and this stuff about the email scandal would never come up. Let\u2019s say you and I are playing and you\u2019re Hillary Clinton and I\u2019m playing as Rubio, and the Hillary Clinton email scandal pops up and knocks you down and causes you to lose, but Rubio doesn\u2019t get a random event\u2026 people will say \u201cthis game is biased against \u2018so and so.\u2019 That\u2019s why we took it out, because unless we could guarantee that it would come up for both candidates (it which point it\u2019s predictable) it\u2019s not fair. And if it\u2019s predictable then you might as well put it as a stat. So we can put a stat that says that Hillary Clinton\u2019s credibility is lower than Rubio\u2019s, but Rubio has less experience. People will accept that.\n\nSo in the last game you had a lot of historical presidential candidates \u2013 are these included this time around?\n\nWardell: We have them but we are debating still on how to implement them; we\u2019re going into Steam Early Access for right now, so what we\u2019re debating is whether those candidates should be available to play from the beginning. Because what usually happens is in multiplayer people would just run as George Washington because he had like \u201cthe god stats,\u201d and that kind of takes a lot of the fun out of the game. Everyone is just playing Washington vs. Jefferson, every single game. So we\u2019re debating if those are going to be unlocked only after playing through the game\u2019s mini-campaigns.\n\nYou haven\u2019t decided one way or the other at this point, right?\n\nWardell: Right. We have the assets and we\u2019ve updated all the classic candidates \u2013 the graphics across the entire game have been updated \u2013 but we haven\u2019t decided how we\u2019re going to use those particular assets yet.\n\nBut they aren\u2019t going to end up being DLC or anything like that, right?\n\nWardell: No. We\u2019re not planning on putting out any DLC. This time we want the game to come out early enough so we can do pre-updates to update the game with new issues.\n\nWhat is your target date for the final release?\n\nWardell: The 1.0 version will come out before the first primary, because previously we waited until July to release and at that point it\u2019s too late.\n\nSo sometime in February or around there?\n\nWardell: Well we\u2019ll go into Early Access in the next week or two and then we can find out from players what they want and don\u2019t want. Like I\u2019ve said, we\u2019ve been playing it for awhile and we\u2019ve made some hard choices.. like one of the most expensive things was the baggage feature, which we had to write up, come up with, and then tear it out. I hate doing that.. unlike the previous games where when it was done that was it, we can come out with multiple updates to do things like ad new issues. It\u2019s kind of exciting because we can come out with the game and keep updating it right up until the election.\n\nSo someone at Stardock is going to pay attention to the campaigns and add stuff into the game?\n\nWardell: Oh yeah. This time we have actually budgeted that in. In the previous versions the game was done and we\u2019d release around August when the VP candidates are picked or during the national conventions, but the problem with that is that at that point everything is kind of done. This time we\u2019re going to release it early enough to be able to apply those updates. Previous releases were always at retail, so we really couldn\u2019t do that and it wasn\u2019t really fair to those customers. Now that the market is all digital it\u2019s really easy for us to update all the issues on the fly.\n\nNow is this the first Political Machine to be released on Steam?\n\nWardell: Post-Impulse [Stardock\u2019s digital distribution platform that it sold off] we always made a version of it available on Steam, but this is the first version that isn\u2019t going to have a retail box. When you\u2019re not doing a boxed version it really does change things and allows you to be a lot more flexible. In terms of updating the issues and stuff; in the past when people bought the game at retail it wasn\u2019t really worthwhile to budget for things like updating issues because only a tiny fraction of the market was going to actually get to use it. Now if it\u2019s pure digital, we know everyone\u2019s going to get those updates. Here\u2019s one of the things we want to be able to do is like.. you watch a debate on TV and some gaffe happens\u2026 we can update that night on Steam with new issues. And you can go and play the next day and all of the sudden you\u2019ll see \u201cRubio admits he\u2019s not American-born\u201d or something.\n\nSo unfortunately you can\u2019t run a primary in the game. Why is that?\n\nWardell: No this game always assumes you already have the candidates picked for each party. That would be an interesting thing\u2026 the only thing is that might make the game feel like it\u2019s a drag because we really want people to be able to go in, play the game and it\u2019s relatively straight forward\u2026 something you can play during lunch.\n\nYeah and there\u2019s like 300 candidates on the Republican side in this cycle\u2026\n\nWardell: There\u2019s a lot! Oh, and Trump was hard to put in the game because of his hair\u2026\n\nYeah, and you have to be careful.. you don\u2019t want him to look like he\u2019s going to fly off the screen or something\u2026\n\nWardell: Someone made his hairpiece as a running mate at one point during development, but we took that out.\n\nYou\u2019re a pretty political guy and you\u2019re not afraid to express your opinions\u2014\n\nWardell: Well. I\u2019m very opinionated, but I\u2019m not super ideological. A lot of people think I\u2019m a right-winger, but I\u2019m more of a libertarian\u2026 some people think that means right-winger, but I\u2019m pro-choice, pro-gay marriage, and I have no problem with the welfare state stuff; but on certain issues I\u2019m also \u201cright\u201d \u2013 like most people I have a mixture of positions on issues.\n\nSo let\u2019s do a little handicapping here; who do you think is going to be at the top after the first primaries next year in Iowa and New Hampshire?\n\nWardell: Iowa doesn\u2019t matter anymore\u2026 If I had to pick I\u2019d say that the end of this it will be Hillary Clinton vs. Marco Rubio. A lot of this stuff comes down to who has the better organization \u2014 people can talk about Donald Trump all they want but he doesn\u2019t have a sufficient on-the-ground organization to carry him through. I remember last time people liked Newt Gingrich a lot, and he never had a chance because in primaries it really boils down to what organizations you\u2019ve set up \u2013 which we do model in the game \u2013 and ironically the only two candidates that have a semblance of a ground game on the Republican side at this stage \u2013 well, I mean, actually Jeb Bush does but I don\u2019t think he has a chance \u2013 is Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz (who I never would have thought was a contender but based on the ground game stuff \u2013 and I wouldn\u2019t vote for him in a primary), who might actually have a chance\u2026\n\nThe media has certainly started to talk about him more after the last Republican debate\u2026\n\nWardell: I don\u2019t think he\u2019s electable, but that\u2019s just my personal opinion\u2026\n\nI\u2019m not going to share my opinion on that\u2026\n\nWardell: If Trump gets in there our next interview will be me calling in from Belize or something\u2026\n\nThis cycle appears to be in line with the last Republican primary cycle. If you look at who was in the lead at about this time in 2012 it was, like Herman Cain\u2026\n\nWardell: Yeah, Herman Cain and Newt Gingrich.\n\nAnd Gingrich only ended up winning Georgia, if I remember correctly\u2026 and Herman Cain didn\u2019t win any, so\u2026\n\nWardell: I guess if Donald Trump makes it any further, then the next time it will be like\u2026 Kim Kardashian vs. some other reality TV star\u2026 that\u2019s where we\u2019ll be as a country\u2026\n\nHave you thought about doing stuff like that for the game \u2013 like, just weird fantasy candidates?\n\nWardell: Back in the original version I had some favorite TV characters in the game, but it wasn\u2019t well received at the time [in reviews]. We seem to get beat up every time. The last one got beat up fairly but a little excessively because you had the people that wanted the game to be completely serious, modeling everything, and should take two hours to play\u2026 and then you have the people that found the game to be too complicated as is. So this time around we\u2019re trying to satisfy both groups better. Last time it was a little shallow on the one hand and yet still too complicated from a UI perspective.\n\nSo you\u2019ve tweaked the UI quite a bit to make it easier for new players?\n\nWardell: Yeah, I\u2019m hoping this time when people load it up they\u2019ll go \u201coh, this is a much more polished product\u201d than what we\u2019ve done before.\n\nDoes it have a tutorial?\n\nWardell: Yes and it also has advisers in the game which it didn\u2019t have before. Before we just threw you in and said \u201cgood luck!\u201d\n\nSo the game\u2019s going to hit Steam Early Access when?\n\nWardell: Probably in the next week or two and then it\u2019ll be in early access until February.\n\nAnd what are you looking to get for people to play the game through early access?\n\nWardell: It\u2019s only going to be around $9. This time around we\u2019re hoping that having a low price, and being more accessible that we\u2019ll get a lot of people wanting to check it out and find it\u2019s a lot of fun.\n\nAll right Brad, thanks for taking the time to talk to us about this game. We\u2019re looking forward to playing it because there aren\u2019t too many games coming out these days that are about politics.\n\nWardell: Which is too bad because the election does make a good game \u2013 especially the American system \u2013 because every state is worth x number of points! It\u2019s as if the founding fathers saw the rise of videogames!\n\nYou can check out The Political Machine 2016 at its website.", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2"}, "article_summary": "Sit back and enjoy my conversation with Wardell about Political Machine 2016 \u2013 one of the few (only?)\nYou\u2019ll find plenty of people who will say \u201cDonald Trump IS a moron\u201d but do you really think Donald Trump is that mentally handicapped?\nLast week in a breezy phone conversation with Stardock founder and CEO Brad Wardell, I learned quite a few things about the latest edition of the company\u2019s casual election simulation, Political Machine.\nBrad Wardell: It\u2019s called The Political Machine 2016.\nWhat are some of the new gameplay elements that are in Political Machine 2016?"}
