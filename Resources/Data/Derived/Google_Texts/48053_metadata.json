To answer that age-old question, Accountemps recently surveyed 320 employees and 2,100 CFOs across 20 of the largest US cities. The results were unexpected.\n\nAlmost half of the CFOs (41 percent) who responded to the survey said their employees wanted better benefits. Only 19 percent thought their employees wanted more vacation time.\n\nBut, surprisingly, 30 percent of employees surveyed said they preferred having more time off.\n\n\u201cEmployers might assume that with the passage of the Affordable Care Act and healthcare benefits being front and center that [better benefits] is the most in-demand perk,\u201d said Bill Driscoll, district president for Accountemps, a division of Robert Half that specializes in providing temporary staffing services for accounting, finance, and bookkeeping professionals. \u201cHowever, managers shouldn\u2019t assume they know what their employees want.\u201d\n\nDriscoll advises managers to ask their team members about which workplace perks are most meaningful to them.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re not offering those incentives that rank highest on their wish list, your efforts to motivate or retain workers could fall flat,\u201d Driscoll said.\n\nTrending {{item['sft-title']}}\n\nWith the economy and job market improving, certainly for accounting and finance professionals, Driscoll said more companies are offering additional vacation days and paid time off.\n\n\u201cMany companies evaluate their compensation, benefits, and perks to remain competitive, as the economy improves and the war for talent heats up,\u201d he noted. \u201cOffering additional vacation time shows employees that you\u2019re committed to helping them achieve greater work-life balance.\u201d\n\nAs a manager himself, Driscoll said he tries to set a good example for his employees. He\u2019s already planning a vacation this year to Italy with his family, and he is encouraging his employees to make sure they are using their vacation time to recharge their batteries.\n\n\u201cVacation days allow employees to take much-needed breaks from work to relax, recharge, and come back with renewed energy and enthusiasm for their job,\u201d Driscoll said. \u201cBoth employees and companies benefit when workers are happy and well-rested.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"foaf": {"name": "Allegra Nagler"}, "dcterms.title": "What Do Employees Want Most: Better Health Benefits or More Vacation Time?", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Practice Excellence"}}, "og": {"site_name": "AccountingWEB", "title": "What Do Employees Want Most: Better Health Benefits or More Vacation Time?", "url": "http://www.accountingweb.com/practice/practice-excellence/what-do-employees-want-most-better-health-benefits-or-more-vacation", "image": "http://www.accountingweb.com/sites/default/files/styles/media_medium/public/default-16x9.jpg?itok=FWa8WdE3", "updated_time": "2015-04-24T10:05:21+00:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.accountingweb.com/practice/practice-excellence/what-do-employees-want-most-better-health-benefits-or-more-vacation", "card": "summary", "title": "What Do Employees Want Most: Better Health Benefits or More Vacation Time?"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#dce6eb", "dcterms.identifier": "http://www.accountingweb.com/practice/practice-excellence/what-do-employees-want-most-better-health-benefits-or-more-vacation", "dcterms.creator": "Allegra Nagler", "dcterms.date": "2015-04-24T10:05+00:00", "dcterms.language": "und", "msapplication-TileImage": "/sites/all/themes/awus/favicon-152.png", "dcterms.type": "Text", "sift": {"targeting": "[{\"key\":\"tag\",\"value\":[\"Time management\",\"Benefits\"]},{\"key\":\"type\",\"value\":\"Article\"},{\"key\":\"subtopic\",\"value\":\"Practice Excellence\"},{\"key\":\"topic\",\"value\":[\"Practice Excellence\",\"Practice\"]},{\"key\":\"url\",\"value\":\"node_19617\"},{\"key\":\"status\",\"value\":\"live\"},{\"key\":\"homepage\",\"value\":\"0\"},{\"key\":\"user\",\"value\":\"out\"},{\"key\":\"CxSegments\",\"value\":\"\"}]"}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-24T12:05:21+01:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-04T17:51:12+01:00"}, "cXenseParse": {"sft-section": "Practice Excellence", "sft-tag": "Time management", "sft-date": "Apr 24th 2015", "sft-type": "Article", "sft-topic": "Practice", "recs": {"category": "Article", "articleid": "node-19617", "publishtime": "2015-04-24T12:05:21:000Z"}, "sft-author": "Allegra Nagler", "sft-title": "What Do Employees Want Most: Better Health..."}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd2bf\"", "article_summary": "Almost half of the CFOs (41 percent) who responded to the survey said their employees wanted better benefits.\nOnly 19 percent thought their employees wanted more vacation time.\n\u201cOffering additional vacation time shows employees that you\u2019re committed to helping them achieve greater work-life balance.\u201dAs a manager himself, Driscoll said he tries to set a good example for his employees.\n\u201cVacation days allow employees to take much-needed breaks from work to relax, recharge, and come back with renewed energy and enthusiasm for their job,\u201d Driscoll said.\nTo answer that age-old question, Accountemps recently surveyed 320 employees and 2,100 CFOs across 20 of the largest US cities."}
