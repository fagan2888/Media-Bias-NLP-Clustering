When she finally got back home, she had less than an hour before starting her 6 p.m. shift decorating cakes at Wal-Mart. She worked until midnight, giving her just a few hours to sleep before starting all over again.\n\nRoth, 68, worked in many jobs over the years, but she never made quite enough to pay back the $33,000 she borrowed years earlier for an education degree she couldn\u2019t afford to complete, and certainly not the $95,000 it ballooned to in default.\n\nShe filed for bankruptcy, wiping out five figures in medical debts. But erasing student loans requires initiating a separate legal process, in which borrowers must prove that paying the debt would cause an \u201cundue hardship.\u201d\n\nTo prepare her case, she copied down statutes at a local law library and watched episodes of Law & Order. Her efforts paid off: Roth\u2019s loans were discharged in 2013.\n\nThat Roth, now living on Social Security, managed to succeed in what is known as a notoriously difficult process is not even the most remarkable aspect of her case. Instead, the ruling captured the attention of other judges and legal scholars because of a judge\u2019s bluntly worded written opinion that rebuked the widely adopted hardship standard used to determine whether a debtor is worthy of a discharge.\n\nThe judge, Jim Pappas, in his concurring opinion for the bankruptcy appellate panel decision in the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, said the analysis used \u201cto determine the existence of an undue hardship is too narrow, no longer reflects reality and should be revised.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cIt would seem that in this new, different environment, in determining whether repayment of a student loan constitutes an undue hardship, a bankruptcy court should be afforded flexibility to consider all relevant facts about the debtor and the subject loans.\u201d But the current standard, he wrote, \u201cdoes not allow it.\u201d\n\nPappas isn\u2019t the only critic. Although plenty of cases still hew closely to a strict interpretation of the test, some judges and courts have signaled in recent years that they believe the rigid standard \u2014 known as the Brunner test \u2014 should be reconsidered, even if they are still bound to it now.\n\n\u201cThe world has changed,\u201d said Michael Kaplan, a federal bankruptcy judge for the District of New Jersey, who criticized the standard in an opinion article. \u201cCertainly, the costs of education and the level of student loan indebtedness has exploded.\u201d\n\nBecause the bankruptcy code never defined \u201cundue hardship,\u201d the courts needed to develop their own definition. Most courts adopted the Brunner test, which originated from a precedent-setting ruling in 1987, in which a woman named Marie Brunner filed for a discharge of her debt less than a year after she completed a master\u2019s degree.\n\nTo stop debtors from trying to prematurely cancel their debts, the case laid out a three-pronged test: Individuals must prove they made a good-faith effort to pay the loan by finding work and minimizing their expenses. Debtors must also show they could not maintain a minimal standard of living based on their income and expenses if they had to repay the debt.\n\nBut then, in arguably the most challenging prong, the court must consider whether that situation is likely to persist for a significant part of the repayment period \u2014 which essentially requires the judge to predict the debtor\u2019s future, ensuring what some courts have described as a \u201ccertainty of hopelessness.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do you prove things won\u2019t change for the better in the future?\u201d said Daniel Austin, associate professor at Northeastern University School of Law.\n\nBankruptcy scholars and judges said the test made sense at the time it was adopted because even if debtors could not pass the test, their debts \u2014 which were far more modest then \u2014 would automatically be discharged in bankruptcy five years after their repayment period started.\n\nBut the legal landscape has changed substantially since then. Before 1977, student loans could be discharged in bankruptcy alongside other debts like credit card balances. Congress toughened the law in 1976, adding the five-year period, and again in 1990, when the waiting period was extended to seven years.\n\nIn 1998, the waiting period was eliminated. So now, all debtors must prove undue hardship to erase their student debts. (In 2005, Congress added private student loans to the mix of federal education debt that could not be discharged.)\n\nThis year, President Barack Obama instructed several government agencies to review, by Oct. 1, whether the treatment of student loans in bankruptcy should be altered. But the fate of the proposal may be similar to previous legislation calling for student loans to be dischargeable in bankruptcy. Those bills never went anywhere.\n\nA large part of the problem is that only a tiny percentage of debtors attempt to discharge their student loans in bankruptcy, perhaps because of the perception that it isn\u2019t possible or is too hard.\n\nBut debtors\u2019 best chance at having their student loans wiped away may simply be to try.\n\nTara Siegel Bernard,\n\nThe New York Times", "article_metadata": {"description": "Some judges have signaled they believe the rigid standard should be reconsidered, even if they are still bound to it now.", "og": {"description": "Some judges have signaled they believe the rigid standard should be reconsidered, even if they are still bound to it now.", "title": "Judges rebuke limits on wiping out student loan debt", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20150719-judges-rebuke-limits-on-wiping-out-student-loan-debt.ece", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/news/education/headlines/20150719-your_money_45029795.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/YOUR_MONEY_45029795.JPG", "height": 853}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2015-07-20T03:51:01Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2015-07-20T00:17:12Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Judges rebuke limits on wiping out student loan debt\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20150719-judges-rebuke-limits-on-wiping-out-student-loan-debt.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/news/education/headlines/20150719-your_money_45029795.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/YOUR_MONEY_45029795.JPG\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"2368429\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-07-20T00:17:12Z\", \"section\": \"Economy & You Headlines\", \"author\": \"\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/news/education/headlines/20150719-your_money_45029795.jpg.ece/ALTERNATES/w660/YOUR_MONEY_45029795.JPG", "publishtime": "2015-07-20T00:17:12Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "article_summary": "(In 2005, Congress added private student loans to the mix of federal education debt that could not be discharged.)\nBut the fate of the proposal may be similar to previous legislation calling for student loans to be dischargeable in bankruptcy.\nBut debtors\u2019 best chance at having their student loans wiped away may simply be to try.\nSo now, all debtors must prove undue hardship to erase their student debts.\nThis year, President Barack Obama instructed several government agencies to review, by Oct. 1, whether the treatment of student loans in bankruptcy should be altered."}
