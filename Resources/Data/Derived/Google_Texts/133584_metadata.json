That's according to an analysis of census data by the Pew Research Center.\n\nNearly one-third of millennials live with their parents. That's slightly more than the proportion who live with a spouse or partner. The remaining young adults are living alone or in college dorms or other circumstances.\n\nThe trend has been particularly evident among Americans who lack a college degree.\n\nThe pattern may be a contributing factor in the sluggish growth of the U.S. economy, which depends heavily on consumer spending. With more young people living with their parents rather than on their own, fewer people need to buy appliances, furniture or cable subscriptions.\n\nThe recovery from the recession has also been hobbled by historically low levels of home construction and home ownership.\n\nAs recently as 2000, nearly 43 percent of young adults ages 18 to 34 were married or living with a partner. By 2014, that proportion was just 31.6 percent.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Many of America's young adults appear to be in no hurry to move out of their old bedrooms.", "language": "english", "author": "The Associated Press", "og": {"url": "http://www.wkyt.com/content/news/Goodbye-empty-nest-Millennials-staying-longer-with-parents-380702751.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/Home98.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Many of America's young adults appear to be in no hurry to move out of their old bedrooms.", "title": "Goodbye, empty nest: Millennials staying longer with parents"}, "twitter": {"description": "Many of America's young adults appear to be in no hurry to move out of their old bedrooms.", "title": "Goodbye, empty nest: Millennials staying longer with parents", "url": "http://www.wkyt.com/content/news/Goodbye-empty-nest-Millennials-staying-longer-with-parents-380702751.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/Home98.jpg", "creator": "@wkyt", "site": "@wkyt", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Goodbye, empty nest: Millennials staying longer with parents", "fb": {"app_id": 52140914980, "pages": 33684860765}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "FqJZslm8gAesoZ0HsqSrtOk2ypS-GmcIcdZP8leg9_I", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Goodbye, empty nest Millennials staying longer"}, "article_summary": "Many of America's young adults appear to be in no hurry to move out of their old bedrooms.\nAs recently as 2000, nearly 43 percent of young adults ages 18 to 34 were married or living with a partner.\nFor the first time on record, living with parents is now the most common arrangement for people ages 18 to 34.\nWith more young people living with their parents rather than on their own, fewer people need to buy appliances, furniture or cable subscriptions.\nNearly one-third of millennials live with their parents."}
