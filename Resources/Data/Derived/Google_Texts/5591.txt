AMES, Iowa – Iowa State has fired football coach Paul Rhoads following Saturday’s meltdown loss at Kansas State.

Iowa State confirmed the firing and said that players were called to a Sunday meeting where they were told of Rhoads dismissal with one game to play.

Rhoads coached ISU to a winning season in his first year, but has followed with six straight losing campaigns, including three wins in 2013, two in 2014, and three in 2015 with one game to play, at West Virginia.

Athletics Director Jamie Pollard has said repeatedly he would evaluate Rhoads at the end of the season, and Pollard said he didn’t believe in mid-season firings, but the debacle in Manhattan must have changed Pollard’s thinking.

Rhoads fired offensive coordinator Mark Mangino mid-season. A twitter account known to have been Mangino in the past tweeted Saturday, “There is no doubt at all… The Fat Lady is singing!” Mangino’s son is on Rhoads staff.
