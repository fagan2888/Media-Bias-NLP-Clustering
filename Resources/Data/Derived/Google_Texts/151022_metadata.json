Frank Lautenberg (N.J.), have long sought reforms to the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) of 1976, though the effort has repeatedly stalled in previous years.\n\nThe Udall-Vitter bill, named after Lautenberg, would force the Environmental Protection Agency to base chemical safety decisions solely on considerations of risk to public health and the environment, and eliminates TSCA's \"least burdensome\" requirement for regulating a chemical, which prevented the EPA from banning asbestos.\n\nOpponents of the bill, however, say it would stop states from being able to issue their own protects and fails to address asbestos, the known carcinogen the EPA has unable to ban.\n\nDispleased with the Udall-Vitter bill, Sens. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) and Ed Markey (D-Mass.) introduced their own legislation, The Alan Reinstein and Trevor Schaefer Toxic Chemical Protection Act, which would require the EPA to act quickly to consider a ban on asbestos and maintains states\u2019 rights to protect people from dangerous toxic chemicals.\n\nInstead of singling out one chemical, Udall has argued his bill gives the EPA the strongest possible authority to protect Americans from harmful substances like asbestos, BPA, styrene and other threats to public health.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The petition asks Democrats to reject the bipartisan bill.", "description": "The petition asks Democrats to reject the bipartisan bill.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Lydia Wheeler", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The petition asks Democrats to reject the bipartisan bill.", "title": "Petition to reject Udall-Vitter chemical bill has 80,000 signatures", "url": "http://thehill.com/regulation/237187-petition-to-reject-udall-vitter-chemical-safety-bill-has-80000-signatures", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-03-27T11:34:31-04:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2015-03-27T11:34-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/regulation/237187-petition-to-reject-udall-vitter-chemical-safety-bill-has-80000-signatures", "dcterms.date": "2015-03-27T09:59-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Lydia Wheeler", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "94th United States Congress, Tom Udall, Toxic Substances Control Act, David Vitter, asbestos, Frank Lautenberg, United States Environmental Protection Agency, Politics of the United States, Environment,Tom Udall, David Vitter,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-27T09:59:13-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-27T11:34:31-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/regulation/237187-petition-to-reject-udall-vitter-chemical-safety-bill-has-80000-signatures", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The petition asks Democrats to reject the bipartisan bill.", "card": "summary", "title": "Petition to reject Udall-Vitter chemical bill has 80,000 signatures"}, "dcterms.title": "Petition to reject Udall-Vitter chemical bill has 80,000 signatures"}, "article_summary": "An online petition asking Senate Democrats to reject a bipartisan bill to reform the nation\u2019s toxic chemical laws has gained 81,026 signatures.\nDispleased with the Udall-Vitter bill, Sens.\nThe group is calling the proposed legislation, which aims to give the Environmental Protection Agency the authority to regulate the nation\u2019s most dangerous chemicals, \u201ca sham chemical safety bill.\u201d\u201cThe Udall-Vitter chemical safety bill is a giveaway to the chemical industry that would stop states from protecting their residents from toxic chemicals,\u201d the petition says.\nTom Udall Tom UdallHonor Frank Lautenberg by protecting our kids House, Senate roll out chemical safety compromise Overnight Energy: Lawmakers closing in on chemical safety deal MORE (D-N.M.) and David Vitter David VitterOvernight Energy: Trump outlines 'America First' energy plan in North Dakota Paul blocks chemical safety bill in Senate House Republican pushes bill to 'curb regulatory overreach' MORE (R-La.)\nCredo Action, which refers to itself as a social change organization, posted the petition on its website to stop the Senate from passing the Frank R.
