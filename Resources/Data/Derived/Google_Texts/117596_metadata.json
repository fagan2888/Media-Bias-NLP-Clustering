He's a student-athlete, he's a kid, he's trying to play a game, he's wearing cherry and silver, he's our brother and he's our teammate. You want to yell at someone, come to the baseball field and yell at me.\"\n\nBirmingham is sticking up for a student athlete who has never even been on his team.\n\nBirmingham felt so strongly about what has taken place in Lobos country, he sent baseball players to hand out 'Go Cullen' signs before Saturday\u2019s game versus San Jose State.\n\n\"Support our fellow Lobos,\u201d Lobos baseball player Austin Isenhart said. \u201cHe's been going through a tough time so we just figured we'd help him out. We know if we were in that kind of situation we'd want him to do the same.\"\n\nAround 13,000 Neal supporters came to The Pit with some of their own \u201cGo Cullen\u201d signs in hand to give Neal the biggest ovation he\u2019s received since putting on the cherry and silver.\n\n\"It was awesome,\u201d Cullen\u2019s father and UNM basketball head coach Craig Neal said. \u201cIt's good to see. I feel kind of bad that I had to come out and say something. It's one of those things where you don't want that to happen. You just want the fans to support all our players in our program and I would've done that for any player. It just so happens he's my son.\"\n\nCraig Neal revealed the threats have shaken his son mentally, and it has affected his play on the floor.\n\n\"Nobody deserves that,\u201d Lobo fan Bob Agnew said. \u201cPeople forget these are kids playing a game.\"\n\n\"I am absolutely embarrassed for my fellow fans who have stepped over the line,\u201d Kenneth Peters said.\n\nNeal Is one of the best players on this team averaging 13 points and 4 assists per game.\n\n\"He's turning his energy around,\u201d Neal\u2019s teammate Elijah Brown said. \u201cI think the fact that he knows we have his back. The fact that he knows (now) that the fans are supporting him. I think he'll start to come around and just be the player he is.\"\n\nLobo faithful made it loud and clear Saturday this is a fan base proud to have Neal as their hometown kid.\n\nAfter the game, Neal released this statement:\n\n\"I love this game,\u201d Neal said. \u201cI really appreciate the way this community has supported me and my teammates the past few days. It's an honor to be a student-athlete here and I'm proud to represent this university and this city. We will continue to work hard and strive for excellence.\"", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "www.KOB.com", "description": "Lobo fans as well as Cullen Neal\u2019s teammates speak out about an issue that has sent shock waves through the UNM athletic department.", "title": "Fans rally to support Cullen Neal", "url": "http://www.kob.com/article/stories/s4048076.shtml", "image": "http://www.kob.com/kobtvimages/repository/2016-02/Fans_rally_to_support_Cullen_Neal-syndImport-111643.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 258993120802213}, "description": "Lobo fans as well as Cullen Neal\u2019s teammates speak out about an issue that has sent shock waves through the UNM athletic department.", "robots": "FOLLOW,INDEX", "thumbnail": "http://www.kob.com/kobtvimages/repository/2016-02/Fans_rally_to_support_Cullen_Neal-syndImport-111643.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3560\"", "article_summary": "After the game, Neal released this statement:\"I love this game,\u201d Neal said.\n\"Support our fellow Lobos,\u201d Lobos baseball player Austin Isenhart said.\nHe's a student-athlete, he's a kid, he's trying to play a game, he's wearing cherry and silver, he's our brother and he's our teammate.\nSaturday was the first opportunity for fans to see the Lobos basketball team on the floor since word got out that Cullen Neal has received death threats for his play on the floor.\nYou just want the fans to support all our players in our program and I would've done that for any player."}
