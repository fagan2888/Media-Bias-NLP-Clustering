Twenty to 30 percent of prescriptions are never filled, according to research published in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine, and half of all people do not follow their drug instructions, even when that is critical to keeping them alive.\n\nThe reasons for medication non-adherence, as it is known, are many: For the poor, it is often cost; for some elderly people, it is confusion over the 14 or more prescriptions they receive each year, according to a report from the Food and Drug Administration. Others say they have trouble understanding what their doctors want them to do. Still more hate drug side-effects or aren\u2019t convinced that the medications are helping.\n\nBut even understanding all that, \u201cthe amount of non-adherence is staggering,\u201d said Meera Viswanathan, director of the RTI-UNC Evidence-based Practice Center, a public-private institute that analyzes health care and health policy.\n\nAs much as $289 billion is spent annually on needless hospitalizations, emergency room visits and other costs for people who don\u2019t follow their drug regimens, research shows.\n\nOne study, now 30 years old, attributed 125,000 deaths annually to non-compliance \u2014 about the same number of people who die each year from strokes.\n\nA wide variety of attempted solutions \u2014 including free medicine \u2014 haven\u2019t helped much. But with the Obama administration keen to control medical costs and improve the quality of health care, a round of experiments funded by the Affordable Care Act is winding to a close. They offer hope of progress against one of medicine\u2019s most in\u00adtrac\u00adtable problems.\n\nAll three were part of the $1 billion in \u201chealth care innovation awards\u201d handed out in 2012 under the new law. Other efforts, by public- and private-sector groups, are ongoing.\n\n[Half a million Americans now take $50,000 in prescription drugs yearly]\n\nOne project applies behavioral economics to the problem. Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania gave 1,000 people \u201celectronic pill bottles\u201d when they left the hospital after heart attacks. If they forgot to take their medicine, the cap would light up and beep. If they didn\u2019t comply for a few more days, a designated friend or relative, as well as their doctor, were notified, in the hope that they would remind the patient to take his or her medicine.\n\nIf they took their medications, however, they became eligible to win small lotteries that offer $5 and $50 prizes.\n\n\u201cI know $5 may not seem a lot to you, but it is thrilling to win a lottery,\u201d said Melody Givison, 62, who credits the program with keeping her on her medications for a year. She won two $50 prizes and a dozen $5 awards.\n\nGivison, an account representative for Bank of America, left the hospital with four new medications to take each day, including a blood thinner, aspirin and another drug that helps prevent a second heart attack. She was already on thyroid medication, so now she takes six pills at 9 a.m. and four more at 9 p.m.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re always healthy, except for overweight, you have a tendency to say, \u2018I don\u2019t really need that, I\u2019m busy, I\u2019m doing something,\u2019 \u201d said Givison, of New Castle, Del., who suffered a heart attack in August 2014.\n\nDavid Asch, director of the Center for Health Care Innovation at the university\u2019s medical school, said full results are not yet in, but preliminary data from the study suggest a big improvement in adherence when compared with other efforts involving similar patient populations.\n\n\u201cWe designed it with the foibles of human nature in mind, not with the rational person in mind,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause the rational person would have been taking their meds in the first place.\u201d\n\n[Could these new cholesterol drugs save many from heart attacks?]\n\nIn Hawaii, another project, the $14.3 million \u201cPharm2Pharm\u201d experiment, seeks to connect doctors and pharmacists who dispense medication to patients leaving hospitals with community pharmacists who will continue giving out those medications as those people resume their daily routines.\n\nCommunity pharmacists often complain that they have no idea which medications their patients are taking, especially when they leave hospitals with new ones and can\u2019t guard against dangerous interactions.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not uncommon that they\u2019re on dozens,\u201d said Karen Pellegrin, director of continuing education and strategic planning for the College of Pharmacy at the University of Hawaii at Hilo. That total includes prescription medications, but also supplements, herbals and vitamins that patients take on their own, she said.\n\nIn Wisconsin, more than 25 percent of the state\u2019s pharmacists took a 12-hour training course, then sought out 100,000 people who appeared to be failing to refill their prescriptions or taking incorrect drugs based on data provided by insurers under a\n\n$4.1 million project run by the state\u2019s Pharmacy Society. Most were poor or elderly. After working with the patients, the pharmacists relayed their findings to prescribers.\n\n\u201cCost is a factor, convenience is a factor,\u201d said Chris Decker, the organization\u2019s chief executive officer. \u201cLack of recognition of importance or need, health literacy and understanding\u201d all contribute to non-adherence, as well, he said.\n\nNone of this will matter if patients don\u2019t develop the habit of sticking to their medication regimens once the incentives are removed or intensive assistance ends, the researchers agree. And that is very difficult to achieve.\n\nGivison, the Delaware patient, said she doesn\u2019t think she\u2019ll ever go off her medications again.\n\n\u201cWith the pill bottle going off and knowing I was going to get caught, and I was going to get a call from my sister or my doctor . . . if I got into the car [without taking the medicine], I would turn it off and go back in,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cEven though it\u2019s going to end, I know I\u2019m going to keep taking them, because it\u2019s a habit.\u201d\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this article misspelled the first name of Meera Viswanathan.
