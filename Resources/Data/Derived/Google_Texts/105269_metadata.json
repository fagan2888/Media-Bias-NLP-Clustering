The ruthless murderers in San Bernardino, according to the FBI, had no affiliation with ISIS, but only supported their demented and destructive ideology.\n\nEven so, several candidates, in reaction to the massacre, openly used the phrase \u201cWorld War Three,\u201d while others discussed the group of evil barbarians as if they had invaded New York and were marching toward D.C. as they spoke. Donald Trump and Ted Cruz are not exactly the equivalent of Winston Churchill, and the American people, who panic on command, are not particularly resilient. Ernest Hemingway defined courage as \u201cgrace under pressure.\u201d American politicians, and the Americans who empower them, are currently failing to act with grace while under no pressure. One could only imagine the nightmare of chaos and hysterics that awaits should ISIS actually attack.\n\nSenator Ted Cruz left no room for interpretation when he pounded the podium to announce that the \u201cbiggest threat we face is radical Islamic terrorism.\u201d Fear of terrorism dominates the discourse.\n\nAny time a conversation about terrorism begins in a political debate or on cable news, there is not an elephant, but an unacknowledged gas-guzzling sports utility vehicle in the room that exposes the utter hypocrisy and insincerity of America\u2019s declaration of war on \u201cradical Islam.\u201d\n\nOne of America\u2019s closest allies is Saudi Arabia. The alliance is mostly a one-way relationship in which the United States is subservient and obsequious \u2013 essentially a harem to the Saudi royal family, who collect all the benefits and rewards.\n\nSaudi Arabia is the country most responsible for the rise of radical Islam, and the largest benefactor to Islamic terrorist organizations. According to multiple sources of American intelligence and Indian intelligence, the Saudis have spent billions to build mosques, madrasas and cultural centers dedicated to the promotion of Wahhabism \u2013 the small but growing sect of Islam insistent on literal interpretation of the Quran, and violent jihad.\n\nRobert Baer, a retired CIA officer and author of \u201cSleeping With The Devil: How Washington Sold our Soul for Saudi Crude,\u201d has diagnosed the disease of America\u2019s selective and insincere outrage against Islamic terrorism: \u201cSaudi Arabia has accelerated Islamic fundamentalism to the point that Saudi Arabia, or at least, powerful people in Saudi Arabia, have become an enemy of the United States.\u201d\n\nThat enemy revealed itself on September 11, 2001, when 19 hijackers, 15 of whom were Saudis, successfully launched the worst attack on U.S. soil in the history of the country. Former Senator Bob Graham has strong reason to believe the Saudi connection was not mere coincidence or superficially ethnic. In two separate sworn statements, the former senator explained that, according to the intelligence he reviewed as chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, it is likely that Saudi officials provided aid and comfort to the terrorists responsible for the 9/11 atrocity.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ted Cruz and others love to talk of radical Islamists and World War III.
