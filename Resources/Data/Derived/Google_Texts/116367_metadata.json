But ObamaCare wouldn\u2019t let us keep it. Reluctantly, and after great bureaucratic difficulty, my hubby and I enrolled in an individual market plan with Rocky Mountain Health, which offered a much narrower provider network than the Anthem PPO plan we had before the feds snuffed it out.\n\nThanks to \u201creform,\u201d our two kids\u2019 dental care was no longer covered, and we had our post-ObamaCare insurance turned down at an urgent care clinic \u2014 something that had never happened before.\n\nThis summer came another bombshell.\n\nIn August, we were informed of the \u201cdiscontinuation of your Rocky Mountain Individual and Family plan effective December 31, 2015.\u201d Over the past month, we\u2019ve received several boldface notices alerting us that \u201cIMPORTANT ACTION IS REQUIRED: YOU MUST CHOOSE A NEW INDIVIDUAL & FAMILY PLAN TO MAINTAIN YOUR HEALTH COVERAGE IN 2016.\u201d The clock is ticking: Open enrollment begins Nov. 1.\n\nThe coerced choices are pretty damned crummy. Individual-market PPOs have evaporated. We\u2019re being shoved once again toward the ObamaCare government health insurance exchange vortex known as Connect for Health Colorado (which should really be called \u201cDISconnect from Health Colorado\u201d). Or into a narrow regional HMO.\n\nSo much for \u201cIf you like your doctor, you will be able to keep your doctor, period.

Mother Jones called it the \u201cphony canceled health insurance scandal\u201d when I first reported my 2013 health plan homicide by ObamaCare.\n\nBut it\u2019s real, it sucks and we know we\u2019re not alone among the estimated 22 million other Americans who purchase health insurance directly on the ever-shrinking individual market.\n\nIn Illinois, Blue Cross announced it was eliminating its most popular individual plan with the largest network of doctors and hospitals of any of its offerings, Blue PPO. More than 170,000 enrollees will have to scrounge up an alternative. Customers are panicking, and insurance broker Mike Troha told the Chicago Tribune last week: \u2018\u2018I wouldn\u2019t be shocked if all the PPOs are gone in a few years in the individual markets.\u201d\n\nLast month, the Maryland Insurance Administration approved premium rate increases for small group and individual health insurance plans effective next year, with some rates spiking by double digits, thanks to \u201csignificant changes in regulation and market dynamics over the past two years.\u201d\n\nRemember: One of the reasons for those rate hikes is that ObamaCare forces insurers to carry coverage for items that individual-market consumers had deliberately chosen to forgo. Americans who had willingly and willfully opted for affordable catastrophic coverage-style plans now have fewer and fewer choices.\n\nIn Texas, some 300,000 individual health insurance subscribers are watching their plans, and their access to specialists, disappear. In New Mexico, the state ObamaCare exchange ended all PPO offerings in favor of HMOs. And in Arizona, Aetna, Blue Cross Blue Shield, Cigna and Meritus are all dropping PPO plans offered to tens of thousands of individuals and families.\n\nAs the Arizona Republic\u2019s editorial board noted this weekend, hospitals are consolidating and doctors are quitting their private practices or hitching themselves to the big-hospital wagons. \u201cAnd bigger means fewer options. Only a handful of critics predicted in 2010 that one consequence of ObamaCare would be the return of HMOs.
