Here's how it begins:\n\nOn May 20, 2013, a passenger motor coach run by a Chinatown bus company called Lucky Star departed New York City for Boston\u2019s SouthStation. Shortly after hitting the road, the driver heard a strange bang come from under the bus. The bus seemed to be functioningnormally, so he kept going.\n\nUpon arriving in Boston, the driver was shocked to find a New York City manhole cover lodged in the vehicle\u2019s luggage compartment. Apparently, the bus struck the loose cover in the streets of Manhattan, sending it darting up into the vehicle\u2019s undercarriage. Lucky Star immediately took the bus out of service and sent it to the garage for repairs.\n\nThe following month, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) ordered Lucky Star to cease operating on the grounds that its buses and drivers posed \u201can imminent hazard to public safety.\u201d One of the primary reasons the FMCSA gave for the shutdown was the manhole cover incident. But the out-of-service order, which is the official document revoking the company\u2019s operating license, incorrectly states that after discovering the damage, Lucky Star\u2019s dispatcher kept the vehicle out of the garage and continued sending it on passenger trips in an act of willful negligence.\n\nThe false account of the manhole cover incident is just one of many distortions and inaccuracies that appear in the out-of-service order, according to multiple sources familiar with the investigation. (FMCSA spokesperson Duane DeBruyne declined to comment for this article.) The case of Lucky Star, a well-run company with a nearly spotless accident record, is the latest example of how the government\u2019s stepped-up safety regime is destroying small bus companies to the benefit of large, politically-connected corporate carriers, and in the process making American travelers less safe.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "I have an article up at The Daily Beast looking at how the government's forced shut&nbsp;down&nbsp;of two Chinatown bus companies was based on fabricated", "title": "The Government\u2019s Cheap, Dishonest Campaign Against the Chinatown Bus Industry: Jim Epstein in The Daily Beast", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2013/11/02/the-governments-cheap-dishonest-campaign", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/mc/jepstein/2013_11/LuckyStar6small.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "I have an article up at The Daily Beast looking at how\nthe government's forced shut&nbsp;down&nbsp;of\ntwo Chinatown bus companies was based on fabricated evidence.\nHere's how it&nbsp;begins:\n\nOn May 20, 2013, a passenger motor coach run by a Chinatown bus\ncompany called Lucky Star departed New York City for Boston\u2019s\nSouthStation.
