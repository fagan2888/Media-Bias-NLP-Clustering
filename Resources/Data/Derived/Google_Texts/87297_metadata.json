The Little Rock School District, now under state control, needs to cut about $40 million from its budget as it faces a loss of desegregation funding from the state in the next few years.\n\n\n\n\n\nSince it is under state control, a finance committee is now tasked with sorting out the nickel and dime details for the district.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Notices were sent out Friday to 60 plus Central Administration staff,\" Interim Superintendent Dexter Suggs said at the onset of Monday's committee meeting.\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggs confirmed to the committee the elimination of 30 percent of administrative staff positions within the school district, estimated to save about $3.5 million.

That's a benefit that's desperately needed. A cut in health insurance is a bad, bad idea.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile no final decision has been made, the district is floating the idea of cutting contributions to health plans from $357 a month to $198 a month starting January 1, 2016. Another cut is proposed for January 2017 reducing the contribution to $164 a month.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It doesn't mean all this is going to happen,\" said committee chair Baker Kurrus, \"But it is time to hit that button if that's the button you hit when things get tough.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe state currently requires districts contribute $153 a month to health benefits, and district officials say the change could save more than $6 million dollars.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Whenever you talk about cutting benefits to any insurance there's going to be some concern,\" said Suggs. \"We would certainly get input from those people it would impact. We wouldn't just make this decision out of sight.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nNabors also pointed out that health contributions are a negotiated item for teacher contracts, and she was concerned with the lack of negotiation process built into the plan.\n\n\n\n\n\nKurrus and Suggs both pointed out that it's only a potential option, but added that the district was in a place of facing cuts that would hurt all around.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're going to have to find places to cut and that's a place where we've got to look,\" Kurrus said. \"Obviously, benefits are a component of being competitive, and we want to remain competitive to attract and keep the best educators.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggs, echoed that sentiment, adding that decisions made regarding finances would be in an effort to take the path with the least negative, long-term impacts for employees. Suggs noted that with the amount of money the district is aiming to eliminate, everything is on the table. The only non-negotiable item is the quality education for kids.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We will not deplete our school district in a way it affects our students,\" Suggs said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo follow this story and all of Marci Manley's coverage, click here for Facebook or here for Twitter .
