Alton Strupp/The Courier-Journal\n\nThe pro-Comer PAC is headed by Richard Knock, a Union, Ky., Republican activist. It is preparing to air close to $500,000 in ads over the next three weeks \u2014 a significant investment especially since Comer can't compete financially with candidate Hal Heiner, who has invested $4.2 million of his own wealth into his campaign and has been advertising heavily for two months.\n\nPolls have shown those ads have allowed Heiner to pull ahead.\n\nComer has been on television, mostly with cable TV buys, but has spent about one-sixth as much as Heiner so far.\n\nLouisville businessman Matt Bevin ran his first television ad on Thursday, and the other Republican candidate, former state Supreme Court Justice Will T. Scott, hasn't begun running ads at this point.\n\nMeanwhile, another PAC created by a Denver political consultant with ties to the billionaire Koch brothers, has been formed and intends to help Heiner and will begin airing ads next week, as well.\n\nCitizens for Sound Government has purchased about $640,000 worth of air time on broadcast and cable television over the next two weeks.\n\nAlan Philp, the group's chairman, didn't return a phone call seeking comment.\n\nStephens said he doesn't believe Comer will need as much money as Williams needed four years ago in part because the key in this race will be getting voters out in a low-turnout Republican primary to the polls. After that, he said he believes Comer will be the frontrunner in the general election against Attorney General Jack Conway.\n\nWilliams had a much steeper hill to climb because he was running against Steve Beshear, a popular incumbent, at a time when his own favorability ratings were very low.\n\nA member of Kentuckians for Growth, Opportunity and Prosperity's steering committee, Stephens said he expects the PAC to push a positive message about Comer rather than attacking his opponents.\n\n\"I just feel very strongly that we just want to help him get his message out,\" he said.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cjky.it/1D1A4ID", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Terry Stephens spent $5 helping David Williams in 2011.", "og": {"site_name": "The Courier-Journal", "description": "Terry Stephens spent $5 helping David Williams in 2011.", "title": "Wealthy businessman funding Comer PAC", "url": "http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/04/03/stephens-funding-comer-pac/25264439/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/courier-journal.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Terry Stephens spent $5 helping David Williams in 2011.", "title": "James Comer PAC is funded by wealthy contributor", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3878dbb5b6aae525d5e86d35246da8fe1b66baed/c=0-443-1600-2043&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Louisville/2015/04/03/B9316850718Z.1_20150403180659_000_GESADINV0.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@courierjournal", "site": "@courierjournal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600030236", "fb": {"app_id": 128534137209813}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Persons/Hal Heiner", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Persons/Hal Heiner", "title": "Wealthy businessman funding Comer PAC", "author": "Joseph Gerth", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/politics/elections", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b1f444d330f755661ae3f6055f99e4f3ac00a881/c=0-176-1600-2309/local/-/media/Louisville/2015/04/03/B9316850718Z.1_20150403180659_000_GESADINV0.1-0.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ca357f0640dfb09dec07738a2de3e289f29a7f89/c=0-443-1600-2043/local/-/media/Louisville/2015/04/03/B9316850718Z.1_20150403180659_000_GESADINV0.1-0.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/29775d2c3352084c58ce755d1016fefe08d7af0c/c=0-643-1600-1843/local/-/media/Louisville/2015/04/03/B9316850718Z.1_20150403180659_000_GESADINV0.1-0.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e5e82c6107ffe504d8ee0c28c7f6d36ef1d60f1a/c=0-793-1600-1693&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/Louisville/2015/04/03/B9316850718Z.1_20150403180659_000_GESADINV0.1-0.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-04-03T23:47:40.030000-04:00", "shorthed": "Wealthy businessman funding Comer PAC", "articleid": 25264439, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b5e57ffb8f371b798054aaa60acebd5ba5b84505/c=0-793-1600-1693/local/-/media/Louisville/2015/04/03/B9316850718Z.1_20150403180659_000_GESADINV0.1-0.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/05935f31984abdc7dd65ee54af9b8d941164768f/c=101-0-1499-2486/local/-/media/Louisville/2015/04/03/B9316850718Z.1_20150403180659_000_GESADINV0.1-0.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "James Comer, Jamie Comer, Hal Heiner, Will T.
