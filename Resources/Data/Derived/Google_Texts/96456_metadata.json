Only a fraction of those children are currently in publicly funded prekindergarten. President Obama has called for investing $75 billion in prekindergarten over 10 years for children from lower- and middle-income families.\n\nChild Care Mrs. Clinton and her advisers are considering a mix of tax relief and new federal spending to expand programs for children from birth to age 3. Mr. Obama has called for \u201cuniversal child care\u201d and proposed $200 billion in subsidies over 10 years. Mrs. Clinton would also double federal spending on Early Head Start programs, which would probably cost about $2 billion a year.\n\nJobs Mrs. Clinton has promised to create an infrastructure bank and sell bonds to pay for improvements to roads, bridges, railways and other job-generating projects. Mr. Obama and congressional Democrats have proposed a $50 billion bank. Mrs. Clinton has also spoken generally of creating \u201cnew incentives for companies that give their employees a fair share of the profits.\u201d\n\nGun Safety After the church massacre in Charleston, S.C., Mrs. Clinton called for \u201ccommon-sense gun reforms\" that keep guns \"out of the hands of criminals and the mentally unstable while not penalizing responsible gun owners.\u201d She has yet to lay out specifics. Universal background checks would expand federal policy regarding guns. Costs might be involved if, for instance, Mrs. Clinton proposes grants to states to help with background checks.", "article_metadata": {"thumbnail_75": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/08/us/politics/08Policy-listy/08Policy-listy-thumbStandard.jpg", "ptime": 20150709090610, "twitter": {"description": "Both candidates have laid out lofty policy proposals that would require high levels of new spending in areas ranging from child care to job growth.", "creator": "patrickhealynyt", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/07/09/us/politics/hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/08/us/politics/08Policy-listy/08Policy-listy-articleLarge.jpg", "title": "For Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, Bold Fixes Mean High Price Tags", "site": "@nytimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us/politics", "DISPLAYDATE": "July 9, 2015", "org": "Democratic Party", "keywords": "Presidential Election of 2016,Democratic Party,Clinton  Hillary Rodham,Sanders  Bernard", "applicationName": "interactive", "PT": "Multimedia", "author": "Patrick Healy", "SCG": "politics", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Sanders, Bernard", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By PATRICK HEALY", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "thumbnail_75_width": 75, "lp": "Both candidates have laid out lofty policy proposals that would require high levels of new spending in areas ranging from child care to job growth.", "tom": "interactive_feature", "description": "Both candidates have laid out lofty policy proposals that would require high levels of new spending in areas ranging from child care to job growth.", "CG": "us", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "July 9, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "Sanders, Bernard", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/politics/index.jsonp", "author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/h/patrick_d_healy/index.html"}, "slug": "hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20150720122939, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/07/09/us/politics/hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/08/us/politics/08Policy-listy/08Policy-listy-facebookJumbo.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Both candidates have laid out lofty policy proposals that would require high levels of new spending in areas ranging from child care to job growth.", "title": "For Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, Bold Fixes Mean High Price Tags"}, "pdate": 20150709, "des": "Presidential Election of 2016", "thumbnail_75_height": 75, "articleid": 100000003787754, "hdl": "For Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, Bold Fixes Mean High Price Tags", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/08/us/politics/08Policy-listy/08Policy-listy-thumbLarge.jpg", "PST": "Interactive"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1148\"", "article_summary": "Universal Prekindergarten Mrs. Clinton would give money to states to provide preschool for every 4-year-old within a decade.\nCosts might be involved if, for instance, Mrs. Clinton proposes grants to states to help with background checks.\nJobs Mrs. Clinton has promised to create an infrastructure bank and sell bonds to pay for improvements to roads, bridges, railways and other job-generating projects.\nMrs. Clinton would also double federal spending on Early Head Start programs, which would probably cost about $2 billion a year.\nPresident Obama has called for investing $75 billion in prekindergarten over 10 years for children from lower- and middle-income families."}
