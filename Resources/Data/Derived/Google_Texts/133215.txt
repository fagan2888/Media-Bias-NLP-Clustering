Indiana Gov. Mike Pence will campaign for Texas Sen. Ted Cruz Monday, The Indianapolis Star reports. Pence endorsed Cruz last Friday and cut a radio ad for the Texas Republican as well.

“I really admire the way Ted Cruz has been willing to stand up for taxpayers in opposing runaway spending, deficits and debt, calling for and leading on repealing Obamacare,” Pence says in the ad. “I think the man has shown the courage of his convictions. It’s not a popular thing in Washington, D.C., to take on the leadership of your own party, and he’s been willing to do that.”

A series of polls in the state have been released showing mixed results between Cruz and Donald Trump.

Some recent polls show Trump six to nine points ahead, while another poll showed Cruz 15 points ahead of Trump. An aggregation of six polls by Real Clear Politics shows both candidates running neck and neck within the margin of error
