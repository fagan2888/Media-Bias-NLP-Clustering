Louisville Metro Police are investigating the death of a former Metro Corrections inmate who died more than two weeks after being released from the city jail where he allegedly tried to commit suicide.

Corrections officers discovered James Earl Ashby unresponsive on the sixth floor of corrections on Oct. 4, jail officials said. Corrections staff and medical personnel immediately began emergency response efforts before the inmate was transported by ambulance to University of Louisville Hospital.

“Ashby apparently used his bed sheets to hang himself in a cell,” Steve Durham, assistant corrections director, said.

Two days later, Ashby was released from custody, but remained hospitalized where he was cared for by medical staff and supported by family members. He was pronounced dead on Oct. 21.

“Louisville Metro Police’s Public Integrity Unit is investigating this incident, a standard procedure for any serious event in the detention facility, and Metro Corrections Director Mark Bolton instructed Metro Corrections Professional Standards to begin the department’s internal review,” Durham said.

Ashby, 36, was booked on Sept. 3 on charges of drug trafficking, possession of drug paraphernalia and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.
