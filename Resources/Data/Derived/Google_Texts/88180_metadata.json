But Moon tells the Columbia Daily Tribune he didn't mean for his archaic phrasing to demean Missouri's women lawmakers.\n\n\"It is just like going to war,\" Moon tells the Tribune. \"You want a soldier to fight like a man. If a woman is in the trenches, you want them to fight like a man, too.\"\n\nSee also: Rep. Nick Marshall Files to Impeach Gov. Jay Nixon for Letting Gay Couples File Joint Taxes\n\nThe term \"manly firmness\" is a throwback to a line in the Declaration of Independence: \"He [King George III] has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.\"\n\nRather than elevate his rhetoric to match current times when government isn't exclusively run by land-owning white men, Moon says he included the phrase to show how vehemently he wants Congress to repeal, and not replace, the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\"It was not meant to downplay their womanhood at all,\" Moon tells the Tribune. \"We just want them to know, every man and lady who is representing us, that we are demanding, as citizens of Missouri, that Obamacare be repealed and make it clear we don't want a replacement.\"\n\nAfter all, Moon mansplains, there are plenty of smart ladies out there.\n\n\"I know there are some women who are much smarter than I am, and I tip my hat to them,\" he said.\n\nUpdate, 10:50 a.m.: Here's Senator Claire McCaskill's response to Moon's resolution asking her to act with \"manly firmness:\"\n\n\"I don't think you prove your manhood by kicking folks off their health coverage and once again letting insurance companies discriminate against women and sick people,\" McCaskill said in a statement.
