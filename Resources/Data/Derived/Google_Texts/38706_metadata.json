The group was asked to leave the Sedano's and move to a parking lot about a block away.\n\nA manager at Sedano's said the volunteers never contacted corporate offices to gain access. The first volunteer to arrive had no idea they didn't have permission.\n\n\"I don't know if it was a coordination thing or it was just meet up over there and we were going to stand out on the corner with signs,\" volunteer Larry Brown said.\n\nEven though the volunteers were asked to leave, they said it won't stop them from trying to sign people up.\n\n\"There was nothing that was going to stop us,\" Rosalyn Clark with Organizing for Action.\n\nThe volunteers said they handed out 300 informational flyers on Tuesday.
