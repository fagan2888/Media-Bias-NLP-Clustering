Initiatives are tackling primary care delivery, disease prevention and the industry's hottest issue \u2014 prescription drug costs. But some of these initiatives will just be getting started when President Obama leaves office Jan. 20, 2017. For example, the second part of the administration's highly contested Medicare Part B drug payment model is slated to go into effect after Jan. 1, 2017, according to the report. Timing means this fledgling initiative and others \u2014 and perhaps even the entire CMMI itself \u2014 will be incredibly vulnerable as a new president takes the helm in 2017.\n\nWith the possibility of its work being undone looming, the CMMI can only hope some of its successful regulatory reforms stick. And though the center has had some failures, overall it counts many successes. According to STAT, a 2015 government report found new payment models \u2014 many of which were created by CMMI \u2014 are credited with helping save thousands of lives and billions of dollars because of fewer hospital complications.\n\nMore articles on leadership and management:\n\nAsk Chuck: This CEO's health system merged 2 years ago \u2014 but he still hears 'us v. them' comments from staff\n\nHouse GOP to lay out ACA replacement draft\n\nRestructuring spurs 110 layoffs at Howard University Hospital\n\n\u00a9 Copyright ASC COMMUNICATIONS 2016.
