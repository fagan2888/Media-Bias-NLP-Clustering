With all its entrenched problems and complications, the state Department of Motor Vehicles has caused headaches for Gov. Dannel P. Malloy - and even bigger headaches for the general public.

Malloy compared it to the complicated rollout of the nation's national health law.

"For every governor, this is their Obamacare,'' Malloy told reporters Wednesday. "Particularly replacing [computer] systems. That's what it is. That's why people don't do it.''

He added, "Obamacare eventually straightened itself out. A couple of years later, everyone forgets how everyone's hair was on fire.''
