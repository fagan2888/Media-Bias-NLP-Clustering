They both understand that America is still traumatized and angry over the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nMainstream pols in Brat\u2019s party, take note.\n\nLast week, Brat, an economics professor, came out of nowhere to thrash Eric Cantor, the House GOP\u2019s No. 2 guy, in a Virginia primary.\n\nPeople say Cantor lost because he wanted to legalize some illegal immigrants \u2014 or because people are tired of business as usual, including the Cantor campaign\u2019s nearly $200,000 worth of steak dinners.\n\nOK, but Brat won on another issue, too: ending what he calls \u201ccrony capitalism\u201d for the financial industry.\n\n\u201cEric voted to bail out the big Wall Street banks in 2008,\u201d Brat reminded voters on his Web site. \u201cIt is no coincidence that the same banks that received TARP bailout funds are also some of Cantor\u2019s largest donors.\u201d\n\nOn Brat\u2019s \u201cissues\u201d list, bashing Cantor for his TARP vote comes ahead of bashing Cantor for supporting \u201cillegal immigration amnesty\u201d and \u201cfully fund[ing] Obama\u00adCare.\u201d\n\nBrat was even more explicit in speeches. \u201cAll the investment banks in New York and DC \u2014 those guys should have gone to jail,\u201d he told a crowd last month, according to the Financial Times. \u201cInstead of going to jail, they went on Eric\u2019s Rolodex.\u201d\n\nThen, there was the STOCK Act, which outlawed pols\u2019 insider trading. Nobody paid attention to this 2012 bill, except, apparently, voters. \u201cEric Cantor added an amendment to the bipartisan STOCK Act [that] allows family members of congressmen to get rich from insider trading,\u201d one Brat supporter wrote in a letter to The Virginia Free Citizen three weeks before Election Day.\n\n\u201cAnd he voted to bail out the big Wall Street banks,\u201d she added.\n\nThat Brat was able to use Cantor\u2019s support of Wall Street to propel himself to victory highlights a dilemma for GOP pols.\n\nIt was a Republican president who signed into law the biggest bailout in American history \u2014 yet most Republicans still don\u2019t want to talk about it. They criticize Obama for criticizing the bankers \u2014 and think that somehow helps them.\n\nYes, they\u2019re right to bash Obama\u2019s flawed Dodd-Frank financial-regulation law: It didn\u2019t end too big to fail, as top Obama administration officials have admitted to Congress.\n\nBut mainstream GOP contenders don\u2019t ever come out and say: People are correct to be upset that the bankers who helped cause the 2008 crisis continue to do just fine, even if they got fired \u2014 while regular people struggle with a burden of mortgage and student-loan debt even if they didn\u2019t lose their jobs.\n\nIt should be a key part of Republican speeches to acknowledge how badly the financial industry failed on Republicans\u2019 watch \u2014 and to vow to hold Wall Street accountable to free-market forces as well as to the justice system.\n\nBut in the 2012 presidential primaries, only Rick Santorum brought it up.\n\nRepublicans seem to hope that, as time passes, people will blame Obama and the Democrats, not the Republicans, for the 2008 mess and its hangover.\n\nMaybe, but it\u2019s taking a long time. In April, The Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll asked voters what\u2019s to blame for \u201ccurrent economic conditions\u201d \u2014 \u201cObama\u2019s policies\u201d or a \u201csituation Obama inherited.\u201d Five-plus years into this presidency, 47 percent still blamed Obama\u2019s predecessor. Only 39 percent blame Obama.\n\nYes, Obama\u2019s economic policies have ranged from ineffectual to harmful.But the country\u2019s biggest economic challenge over the past half-decade has been paying off the private-sector debt incurred over the previous decade. Household debt doubled between 2000 and 2008, to nearly $14 trillion.\n\nPeople get that there was never going to be a good way out of this mess, which is why blaming Obama still doesn\u2019t fly.\n\nA mainstream Republican who embraces fixing Wall Street \u2014 and openly admits the GOP\u2019s past failures \u2014 would arm him- or herself well against one potential opponent: Hillary Clinton.\n\nClinton showed her own tune-deafness last week, saying that she and Bill came out of the White House \u201cdead broke.\u201d Of course, donations from the world\u2019s bailed-out top 1 percent allowed the Clintons to climb from poverty into private jets.\n\nBrat\u2019s free-market purism isn\u2019t the answer for the entire GOP (he\u2019s against Medicare prescription drugs, among other things). But the party needs to learn from his victory: Republicans can\u2019t be apologists for Wall Street\u2019s failings if they want to run a credible national race in two years.\n\nNicole Gelinas is a contributing editor to the Manhattan Institute\u2019s City Journal.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "New York Post", "twitter": {"description": "What does David Brat, the Tea Party\u2019s new star, have in common with Elizabeth Warren, the Occupy Wall Street senator from Massachusetts?
