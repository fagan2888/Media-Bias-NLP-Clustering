And things have only gotten weirder and more wonderful and totally better since then.\n\nWe\u2019re in The Great Stagnation, don\u2019t you know, and technological and economic momentum has conked out like the engine on a 1977 Chevy Vega. What we really \u201cneed is more Apollo-like projects\u201d but we\u2019re too chicken-shit and beat-down to think BIG anymore. Or maybe we just need one of those bogus \u201calien invasions\u201d that Paul Krugman is always flapping his gums about. The middle class can\u2019t afford nothing no more, Amazon\u2019s warehouse workers are \u201ctoday\u2019s coal miners,\u201d and even bomb-crazy and jihad-suffering Middle Easternersare more optimistic about the future than Americans and Europeans. The Experts (with a capital E!) have spoken: We\u2019ve reached The End of Progress. So back to Savalas, and bear with me here. Cue up Telly\u2019s incomparable semi-parlando rendering of If. Get lost in the Aegean-deep pools of Telly\u2019s eyes and marvel at his gold-chain-and-bracelet set. As you contemplate a naked celebrity torso apparently unfamiliar with any form of exercise, let\u2019s count the ways in which the world has not just gotten a little bit better but a whole fucking lot better since Kojak was on the case.\n\nAs we contemplate the midterm elections (oy) and the choices spread before like a patient etherized upon a table, read the whole thing.\n\nAnd also take a look at Reason's special landing page about the past, present, and glorious future of the medium formerly known as television.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "A couple of days ago at The Daily Beast I argued that the July 1, 1974 cover of People magazine (above) provided a great benchmark to discuss the question", "title": "What a 40-Year-Old-Cover of People Magazine Says About Progress", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2014/11/01/what-a-40-year-old-cover-of-people-magaz", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/mc/_external/2014_11/still-in-love-with-ya-baby.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A couple of days ago at \nThe Daily Beast I argued that the July 1, 1974 cover of\nPeople magazine (above) provided a great benchmark to discuss the\nquestion of social, technological, and economic progress over the\npast four decades.\nTelly Savalas\u2014born in the early 1920s, a World War II vet, and\nbeloved as the eponymous star of TV's Kojak\u2014was an\nalternati", "title": "What a 40-Year-Old-Cover of People Magazine Says About Progress", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/mc/_external/2014_11/one-more-sign-of-progress-peop.jpg", "creator": "@nickgillespie", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "HomePage", "published_time": "2014-11-01T14:32:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/nick-gillespie"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbdbe\"", "article_summary": "A couple of days ago at The Daily Beast I argued that the July 1, 1974 cover of People magazine (above) provided a great benchmark to discuss the question of social, technological, and economic progress over the past four decades.\nOr maybe we just need one of those bogus \u201calien invasions\u201d that Paul Krugman is always flapping his gums about.\nAnd things have only gotten weirder and more wonderful and totally better since then.\nhave spoken: We\u2019ve reached The End of Progress.\nWe\u2019re in The Great Stagnation, don\u2019t you know, and technological and economic momentum has conked out like the engine on a 1977 Chevy Vega."}
