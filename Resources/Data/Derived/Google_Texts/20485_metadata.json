But a third of the world\u2019s population\u2014some 2.3 billion people\u2014\u201dhad more than five health problems\u201d that same year.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nBecause people are living longer,\u201cComorbidity rose substantially with age and in absolute terms from 1990 to 2013,\u201d the report says. The Global Burden of Disease study found that the proportion of healthy years lost to illness has climbed from 21 percent in 1990 to 31 percent today.\n\nThe world\u2019s aging population also means that there will be more and more sick people around for others to care for.\n\nBritish health magazine The Lancet reported that the study released on June 8 reviewed data from 188 countries and looked at more than 300 illnesses and injuries.\n\nThe study went on to claim that musculoskeletal problems\u2014such as arthritis, back, or neck pain\u2014and mental health or substance abuse disorders accounted for almost half of all loss of healthy years.\n\n\u201cAccording to the study,\u201d USNews.com reported, \u201cone of every 10 people in the world in 2013 suffered from at least one of the following disorders: tooth decay, tension headaches, iron-deficiency anemia, age-linked hearing loss, genital herpes, migraines, intestinal roundworm, and a genetic blood disorder called glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency trait.\u201d\n\nA \u201cstartling rise\u201d in cases of diabetes, Alzheimer\u2019s, and arthritis was also discovered.\n\n\u201cLarge, preventable causes of health loss, particularly serious musculoskeletal disorders and mental and behavioral disorders, have not received the attention that they deserve,\u201d the study\u2019s authors say. \u201cAddressing these issues will require a shift in health priorities around the world, not just to keep people alive into old age, but also to keep them healthy.\u201d\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston, or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A study finds the world's getting sicker despite the longer life spans and higher standards of living experienced by most of the world.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "A study finds the world's getting sicker despite the longer life spans and higher standards of living experienced by most of the world.", "title": "Study Claims the World's Population is Getting Older, Sicker", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2014/12/elderly-women-with-walker-AP.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/06/09/study-claims-the-worlds-population-is-getting-older-sicker/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A study finds the world's getting sicker despite the longer life spans and higher standards of living experienced by most of the world.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2014/12/elderly-women-with-walker-AP.jpg", "title": "Study Claims the World's Population is Getting Older, Sicker", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Age, health, Sickness,Big Government, Data, Medicine,Sicker", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "Sickness", "published_time": "2015-06-09T21:44:22-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,Data,Medicine"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe42dc\"", "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERA new study purports to find that the world\u2019s population is getting sicker despite the longer life spans and higher standards of living being experienced by most of the world\u2019s population.\nBut a third of the world\u2019s population\u2014some 2.3 billion people\u2014\u201dhad more than five health problems\u201d that same year.\nThe new global review of the health of people in the world finds that only 4 percent had no health problems in 2013.\n\u201cLarge, preventable causes of health loss, particularly serious musculoskeletal disorders and mental and behavioral disorders, have not received the attention that they deserve,\u201d the study\u2019s authors say.\nThe world\u2019s aging population also means that there will be more and more sick people around for others to care for."}
