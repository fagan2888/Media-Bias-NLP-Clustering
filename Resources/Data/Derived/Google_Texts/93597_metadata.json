The GOP isn\u2019t far behind.\n\nThe progressive movement has blurred the distinctions between the Republican and Democratic Parties. How did they do it? Where do we go now?\n\nFor our November issue, author and Washington Times news writer Cheryl Chumley looks at the history of the takeover, what it means and where it\u2019s going.\n\nEvery issue of TheBlaze Magazine contains exclusive content not found anywhere else \u2014 online or in print.

The DEOMI\u2019s most recent training manual and student guide for the advisor course, dated January 2013, defined extremism this way: \u201cIn U.S. history, there are many examples of extremist ideologies and movements. The colonists who sought to free themselves from British rule and the Confederate states who sought to secede from the Northern states are just two examples.\u201d\n\nReally?\n\n****Click here to subscribe and get a FREE issue today****\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s craziness,\u201d said Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton, relaying his initial reaction on reading the training manual. \u201cWhen you look at the document in its entirety, it\u2019s incoherent, it\u2019s lunacy, and what\u2019s even scarier, it looks like it\u2019s policy.\u201d\n\nWhat it\u2019s not is an anomaly. Unfortunately, the document is an apt indicator of the nation\u2019s current political wind.\n\nFrom an Internal Revenue Service that can\u2019t keep its regulatory fists off all things Tea Party\u2014relegating nonprofit status applications from conservative groups to bureaucratic purgatory\u2014to the ghastly federal chokehold called ObamaCare that\u2019s wound about our medical providers\u2019 necks, a subtle mood has wafted into our once proudly independent and free nation. It\u2019s infected both political parties, churned up our Constitution and spit out our Founding Father principles.\n\nDemocratic-republic, meet progressivism.\n\nNOT JUST ON THE LEFT\n\nProgressivism is an anti-American mindset that purports to be, as its name suggests, a forward movement\u2014a maturity of political thought, a steady walk toward cultural improvement, an advancement of general welfare. But what it\u2019s really done is turned upside down and inside out the very \u201cgivens\u201d that used to guide our nation\u2019s belief systems, our core values, moral compasses and political endeavors.\n\n****Click here to subscribe and get a FREE issue today****\n\nWhat used to be generally accepted belief is now challenged as radical. What once served as commonsense principle is now mocked and derided. What previously served as part and parcel of our proudest heritage\u2014the American Revolution, the founding documents, the forging of our nation as the shining city upon a hill\u2014is dismissed as extremism, labeled as dangerous by our own military.\n\n[\u2026]\n\nIf only it stayed confined to the Left, to the radicalized hard-line Democratic Party\u2019s base\u2014or to the Socialist Party, where it truly belongs\u2014but it doesn\u2019t.\n\nThanks can go to Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson for bringing the progressive movement to the big-gun bureaucracy of the federal government, via the New Deal and the Great Society plan. Roosevelt served 1901-1909 in the White House as a Republican; Wilson, 1913-1921 as a Democrat.\n\nAnd it\u2019s fitting, too, that, while both these men were historical legends of progressive leadership, they also hailed from different political parties\u2014because that\u2019s how the progressive movement works today.\n\nProgressivism has gained a foothold and, in some cases, an outright stronghold, in both Democratic and Republican camps in present-day politics, which is curious for an ideology that more often than not marches in lockstep with socialist principles and platforms. But that would explain why many in the Republican Party hate the Tea Party with nearly as much vigor as most in the Democratic Party\u2014they\u2019re viewing the \u201cTaxed Enough Already\u201d movement through the same lens of progressive politics.\n\n****Click here to subscribe and get a FREE issue today****\n\nHere\u2019s an example of how deeply the progressive mindset has sunk into America\u2019s political system:\n\nThe now-latent group Republicans for Obama, formed as a nonprofit campaign tool to re-elect Obama in 2012, states on its website that Republican leaders and activists \u201chave written moderates out of the party and have refused to work with the other side.\u201d At the same time, the group states, \u201cPresident Obama has shown himself to be a common-sense centrist,\u201d cutting taxes \u201cwhen necessary,\u201d protecting the environment, and\u2014here\u2019s an eyebrow raiser, for sure\u2014\u201caggressively pursu[ing] Islamic extremists who threaten America.\u201d\n\n\u201cMost notably,\u201d the group says, Obama\u2019s given us ObamaCare, a \u201cRepublican-inspired health-care plan.\u201d\n\nThe group counted among its members at least one former GOP senator, as well as former Ronald Reagan voters, who concluded: \u201cObama would fit in well as a Republican.\u201d\n\nThe name alone, Republicans for Obama, should serve as an obvious example of how the Right\u2019s swung Left, while the Left\u2019s swung even farther Left, and what used to be considered liberal is now centrist\u2014in some cases, even called conservative. But the nugget of truth in the group\u2019s praises of Obama and attempt to paint him as a moderate is this: The ability of government to mandate individuals to obtain health care did make its entry via a Republican door named Mitt Romney.\n\nGOVERNMENT IS THE ANSWER?\n\nWhat constitutional clause gives the government the authority to require Americans to purchase a health-care plan? General welfare? Necessary and proper\u2014also known as the elastic clause? \u2026\n\n****Click here to subscribe and get a FREE issue today****\n\nRegardless, when Hillary Clinton tried to push her government-run health-care package in 1993 during her stint as first lady, conservatives howled, decrying the idea as liberalism run amok and painting her as a socialist.\n\nFast-forward a few years to when Romney was making his run for the White House, facing uncomfortable questions about his passage of RomneyCare but simultaneously stated objection to ObamaCare, Republicans flocked to his defense, making a 10th Amendment case that states have the right to impose regulations where the federal government cannot. In all the back-and-forth that ensued in this matter, though, the larger issue was often overlooked: Government is not the solution. It is, more often than not, the problem.\n\nTo progressives, though, government is the be-all and end-all answer to all problems.\n\n[\u2026]\n\nA couple decades ago, when self-reliance and hard work were still revered traits across most of America and government was not seen as the cure for all of society\u2019s ills, calling government-mandated, taxpayer-funded health care a \u201cneed\u201d would be alternately mocked and condemned\u2014and loudly so. Just ask Hillary.\n\nNowadays, the Republican Party\u2019s most touted members are standing up to their waists in Democratic Party principles, wrapping arms around formerly liberal policies that actually hail from progressive-minded ideology\u2014yet calling themselves staunch Republicans and masquerading as conservatives. \u2026\n\nAfter 40 votes to defund ObamaCare, frustrated Tea Party people concluded it was the Republicans, led by House Speaker John Boehner, Ohio, that were to blame for the voters\u2019 failure. Yet on this issue, Republicans continue to speak out of both sides of their mouths, promising to turn back time on the massive health-care overhaul yet simultaneously shaking their heads in helplessness and wringing their hands in defeat when it comes time to act on those promises. But still, they \u2026\n\n[\u2026]\n\n****************\n\nWe expose much more about the progressive takeover\u2014especially in the GOP\u2014and what it means. And it\u2019s not just ObamaCare that\u2019s a danger\u2014it\u2019s the overall push for larger government in our schools, border security, culture, military and much more.
