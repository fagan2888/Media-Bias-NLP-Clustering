While public university graduate student unions are legion (and played key roles in California\u2019s Occupy movement and Wisconsin\u2019s resistance to Scott Walker), NYU had been the first and only private school to recognize a graduate student union. After George Bush National Labor Relations Board appointees voted in 2004 to reverse a Clinton-era precedent and push grad students outside the protections of New Deal labor law, NYU mounted a campaign against the union, which the UAW charged would otherwise have been illegal. Past and future Democratic officials Cheryl Mills and Jack Lew \u2013 since tapped by the Obama administration as Hillary Clinton\u2019s chief of staff and U.S. Treasury secretary, respectively \u2014 both played roles in NYU\u2019s response to the strike.\n\nWhile GSOC made Obama\u2019s 2008 election a priority in hopes of winning NLRB appointees who would restore Clinton-era precedent and thus their collective bargaining rights, a mix of Republican obstruction, Democratic recalcitrance, and judicial roadblocks repeatedly pushed back the already-slow time frame for that hoped-for result. NYU professor Andrew Ross, who co-edited a volume on the strike, told Salon that with GSOC facing a potential recusal of one of the NLRB\u2019s more pro-labor new members, and NYU\u2019s administration \u201cin a state of siege\u201d over multiple controversies, both sides had a reason to resolve the conflict. Under the deal announced last month, NYU stayed neutral in the election (overseen by the American Arbitration Association), and agreed to recognize and bargain with the union if it won; the UAW agreed to the withdrawal of its NLRB case, and to leave six \u201chard sciences\u201d departments out of the deal.", "article_metadata": {"description": "After right-wing antics and liberal union-busting denied them their union, NYU grad students just won it back", "title": "Tea Party loses again: NYU grad students defy obstruction in precedent-setting 98 percent union vote", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "After right-wing antics and liberal union-busting denied them their union, NYU grad students just won it back", "title": "Tea Party loses again: NYU grad students defy obstruction in precedent-setting 98 percent union vote", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/12/12/tea_party_loses_again_nyu_grad_students_defy_obstruction_in_precedent_setting_98_union_vote/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/12/boehner_lew_cruz.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "After right-wing antics and liberal union-busting denied them their union, NYU grad students just won it back", "title": "Tea Party loses again: NYU grad students defy obstruction in precedent-setting 98 percent union vote", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/12/boehner_lew_cruz.jpg", "creator": "@josheidelson", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Josh Eidelson", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, academy, Barack Obama, Bill Clinton, Cheryl Mills, george bush, Jack Lew, Labor, new york university, NYU, UAW, United Auto Workers", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc01b\"", "article_summary": "While public university graduate student unions are legion (and played key roles in California\u2019s Occupy movement and Wisconsin\u2019s resistance to Scott Walker), NYU had been the first and only private school to recognize a graduate student union.\nAfter George Bush National Labor Relations Board appointees voted in 2004 to reverse a Clinton-era precedent and push grad students outside the protections of New Deal labor law, NYU mounted a campaign against the union, which the UAW charged would otherwise have been illegal.\nPast and future Democratic officials Cheryl Mills and Jack Lew \u2013 since tapped by the Obama administration as Hillary Clinton\u2019s chief of staff and U.S. Treasury secretary, respectively \u2014 both played roles in NYU\u2019s response to the strike.\nUnder the deal announced last month, NYU stayed neutral in the election (overseen by the American Arbitration Association), and agreed to recognize and bargain with the union if it won; the UAW agreed to the withdrawal of its NLRB case, and to leave six \u201chard sciences\u201d departments out of the deal.\nWhile GSOC made Obama\u2019s 2008 election a priority in hopes of winning NLRB appointees who would restore Clinton-era precedent and thus their collective bargaining rights, a mix of Republican obstruction, Democratic recalcitrance, and judicial roadblocks repeatedly pushed back the already-slow time frame for that hoped-for result."}
