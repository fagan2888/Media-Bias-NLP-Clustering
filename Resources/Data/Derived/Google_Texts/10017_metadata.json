For as many people who praise her for the fitness advice she gives on her YouTube channel blogilates, there\u2019s an equal amount of people telling her she\u2019s \u201cso fat\u201d and can\u2019t call herself a trainer with \u201cbelly fat and love handles.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something that\u2019s been eating away at me for a while now,\u201d she said in a video addressing body shaming. \u201cThe hatred and the mean comments that have been swirling around lately, I can\u2019t shake it off.\u201d Ho wondered, too, who ever said fitness instructors all had to look a certain way in the first place.\n\nHo noticed even as she advocated for people to respect one another, she still received a mixed bag of comments. And when commenters took a promotional, photoshopped picture of her \u201cperfect body\u201d too seriously, she decided to make a second video. Surrounded by the negative and rude comments she\u2019s personally received, Ho essentially photoshops her body on camera; she shaves inches from her thighs and abs; increases the shape of her breasts and butt; even changes her eye color.\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting is these changes still don't seem to make Ho happy, the point being chasing someone else's idea of perfection may not be as satisfying as you think.\n\n\u201cIt's tough knowing what's real and what's not when magazine covers and music videos are Photoshopped (yes, music videos), Instagram pics are Photoshopped, and so many women are getting surgery,\u201d Ho said. \u201cHow are we to know what kind of beauty can be naturally achieved when everything around us is so deceiving?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "youtube, star, cassey, ho, makes, powerful, statement, about, perfect, body", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "This fitness personality hopes to change the conversation surrounding body image.", "title": "YouTube Star Makes Powerful Statement About 'The Perfect Body' [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/youtube-star-cassey-ho-makes-powerful-statement-about-perfect-body-330668", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/04/24/youtube-star-cassey-ho-makes-powerful-statement-about-perfect-body.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "This fitness personality hopes to change the conversation surrounding body image.", "title": "YouTube Star Makes Powerful Statement About 'The Perfect Body' [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/youtube-star-cassey-ho-makes-powerful-statement-about-perfect-body-330668", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/04/24/youtube-star-cassey-ho-makes-powerful-statement-about-perfect-body.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/24/youtube-star-cassey-ho-makes-powerful-statement-about-perfect-body.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-04-24T15:09:05-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-24T15:09:04-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "This fitness personality hopes to change the conversation surrounding body image."}, "article_summary": "The negative comments and cyberbulling Cassey Ho encounters on a daily basis can be defeating.\nAnd when commenters took a promotional, photoshopped picture of her \u201cperfect body\u201d too seriously, she decided to make a second video.\nHo noticed even as she advocated for people to respect one another, she still received a mixed bag of comments.\n\u201cHow are we to know what kind of beauty can be naturally achieved when everything around us is so deceiving?\u201d\nSurrounded by the negative and rude comments she\u2019s personally received, Ho essentially photoshops her body on camera; she shaves inches from her thighs and abs; increases the shape of her breasts and butt; even changes her eye color."}
