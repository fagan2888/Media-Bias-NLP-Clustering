One answer \u2014 aside from come on, how do you think that works? \u2014 is that independent measures, like the Billion Price Index, aren\u2019t very different from the official index. Still, people will point to the price of something that has gone up as evidence that we have lots of inflation.\n\nNot that I think such people can be budged, but it is important to realize that relative prices are always shifting around, and that some prices inevitably go up more than the average. As the figure shows, if you go back to the beginning of the Great Recession, food prices have risen more than the overall CPI (although hyperinflation it isn\u2019t), but car prices have risen more slowly (and high-tech stuff has, of course, gotten much cheaper).\n\nPhoto\n\nAnd what about Shadowstats, which claims that inflation is much higher than the government lets on?
