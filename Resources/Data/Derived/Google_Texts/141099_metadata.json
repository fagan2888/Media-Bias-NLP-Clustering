The local government paid the club 20 million euros ($27 million) to promote what was to become Spain\u2019s most notorious \u201cghost airport\u201d \u2014 one that hasn\u2019t seen a single flight since it opened in 2011.\n\nThe deal illustrates one of the peculiarities of Spain\u2019s meltdown: As austerity measures sap the life from health, education and welfare programs, Spain\u2019s soccer teams have been receiving hundreds of millions of dollars in government aid. The government says soccer subsidies are simply part of a policy of supporting sports around the country.\n\nAn Associated Press review of official documents shows that Spain\u2019s highly autonomous regions are helping to keep some soccer teams alive through massive direct cash injections. The financing has some politicians and ordinary Spaniards questioning the support.\n\nThe 20 clubs in Spain\u2019s top soccer league received at least 332 million euros in direct public aid between 2008 \u2014 the beginning of Spain\u2019s financial meltdown \u2014 and 2012, according to the AP review. The funds were allocated through public agencies and companies run by the country\u2019s 17 regional governments. In the same time period, the clubs have also benefited from an additional 476 million euros in indirect aid, such as allowing clubs to run up tax and social security debts.\n\nThat makes the total 810 million euros in the years reviewed \u2014 $1.1 billion.\n\nThe AP tally is based on club accounts, the budgets of local and regional authorities, and documents submitted to regional audit courts that oversee public expenditure.\n\n\u201cSoccer puts the fear of God into politicians,\u201d said Sandalio Gomez, a sports management expert at the IESE Business School in Madrid. \u201cThey find ways of getting money to the clubs without which (the clubs) would not survive.\u201d\n\nThe European Union is investigating whether government loan guarantees for seven Spanish clubs violate EU competition law, designed in part to prevent businesses from enjoying unfair advantage through state intervention. The probe is examining tax breaks granted to the Real Madrid, Barcelona, Athletic Bilbao and Osasuna soccer clubs.\n\nTen of the 23 members of Spain\u2019s national team \u2014 the reigning champion playing its opening World Cup match on Friday \u2014 belong to those clubs. So do many of the World Cup\u2019s other biggest stars: Brazil\u2019s Neymar, Portugal\u2019s Cristiano Ronaldo and Argentina\u2019s Leonel Messi all draw their salaries from clubs being investigated, though the great bulk of their income comes from sponsorship deals rather than government subsidies.\n\nBut that\u2019s just a part of government assistance to Spain\u2019s soccer league, according to the AP review.\n\nThe largest case of government subsidies can be found in the city of Valencia, on Spain\u2019s eastern seaboard. The AP found that over the 2008-12 period, the Valencia region pumped 169 million euros into its four top-flight soccer clubs: Valencia, Elche, Levante and Villareal.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Spain props up soccer amid crushing austerity", "title": "Spain props up soccer amid crushing austerity", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Spain props up soccer amid crushing austerity", "title": "Spain props up soccer amid crushing austerity", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/13/spain_props_up_soccer_amid_crushing_austerity/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/spain-bankrolling-soccer.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Spain props up soccer amid crushing austerity", "title": "Spain props up soccer amid crushing austerity", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/spain-bankrolling-soccer.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Jorge Sainz", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The probe is examining tax breaks granted to the Real Madrid, Barcelona, Athletic Bilbao and Osasuna soccer clubs.\nTopics: From the Wires, NewsVALENCIA, Spain (AP) \u2014 At the height of Spain\u2019s crushing economic crisis, the Villareal soccer club sported an eye-catching logo across its jerseys: Aeroport Castello.\nThe AP found that over the 2008-12 period, the Valencia region pumped 169 million euros into its four top-flight soccer clubs: Valencia, Elche, Levante and Villareal.\nThe deal illustrates one of the peculiarities of Spain\u2019s meltdown: As austerity measures sap the life from health, education and welfare programs, Spain\u2019s soccer teams have been receiving hundreds of millions of dollars in government aid.\nBut that\u2019s just a part of government assistance to Spain\u2019s soccer league, according to the AP review."}
