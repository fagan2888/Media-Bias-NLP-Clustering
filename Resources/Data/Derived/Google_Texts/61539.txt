Story highlights Bush has a little more than a month to pull himself ahead of the crowded field of Republicans

Bush is one of several Republican candidates in New Hampshire this week

Derry, New Hampshire (CNN) Jeb Bush on Tuesday kicked off his first trip of the year in New Hampshire, resuming his quest to make an epic comeback and relying heavily on the first-in-the-nation primary state to get him there.

Bush has a little more than a month to pull himself ahead of the crowded field of Republicans vying for a top spot in the state's important contest on February 9. In the front of that race is Donald Trump, and Bush has ramped up his strategy to become the anti-Trump candidate in hopes that voters who feel disenfranchised by the front-runner will coalesce around Bush instead.

"If you're a disabled person, it's not very funny when you get disparaged by the leading candidate in the Republican Party. Or if you're a woman and you get disparaged, it's not funny at all," Bush told a small audience at a town hall in Derry on Tuesday morning. "If you're looking for some guy like that, I'm not your guy."

Bush is one of several Republican candidates in New Hampshire this week. Many of them, including Bush, will attend a forum combating drug addiction and the heroin epidemic. But the dominating topic of the day is guns, as President Barack Obama rolls out his new executive actions aimed to curb gun violence.

In recent interviews, op-eds and campaign videos , Bush has been adamant in his support for Second Amendment rights and opposition to Obama's new policies. At his town hall, he blasted Obama for bypassing Congress, saying he "doesn't have the authority to do it" and argued that efforts to close the so-called gun show loop hole won't "solve any problems."
