Some defendants face cockfighting related charges while others face charges of selling cocaine, possessing illegal firearms, and animal cruelty.\n\nThe army of defendants, supporters, and lawyers all crowded into the fourth-floor the Miami-Dade County courthouse for arraignments. Many of the accused pled not guilty to the charges they were facing, meaning many of the cases could end up with a jury trial.\n\nIvan Ortega, one of the defendants, pled not guilty and said he was mistreated by Miami-Dade Police officers during the raid. Ortega said police stripped him naked and then took his money. He and others said cops took their credit cards, cell phones, and stole large amounts of cash found at the scene.\n\nMiami-Dade Police said an internal affairs investigation has been launched into the allegations of police misconduct.\n\nWhen the initial raid went down, police initially detained almost 200 people at the home. Some were released and not charged, but others said they were doing something akin to a horse race.\n\n\u201cBasically, it\u2019s like what they do in the horse track,\u201d defendant Fransisco Benitez said. \u201cThey whoop the horses, they burn them, they give them a little tattoo, they burn them through the butt. But like I said, there was no animal cruelty.\u201d\n\nMany of the defendants were offered pretrial diversion programs along with a fine in exchange for having the charges dropped. Those who didn\u2019t accept the pretrial diversion must now get ready for a trial that is tentatively scheduled for July 14.\n\nCourt documents showed the alleged ring leader of the cockfighting ring, Francisco Ruiz Arias, was arrested 16 years ago on two counts of fighting and baiting animals.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A courtroom in Miami-Dade County was overflowing with defendants Friday as 158 people walked in to face accusations they were involved in a cockfighting ring.", "title": "Crowded Court Deals With Cockfighting Arrests", "og": {"site_name": "NBC 6 South Florida", "description": "A courtroom in Miami-Dade County was overflowing with defendants Friday as 158 people walked in to face accusations they were involved in a cockfighting ring.", "title": "Cockfighting Defendants Flood Court", "url": "http://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/Crowded-Court-Deals-With-Cockfighting-Arrests-260458191.html", "image": "http://media.nbcmiami.com/images/1200*675/042514+cockfighting+suspects+2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A courtroom in Miami-Dade County was overflowing with defendants Friday as 158 people walked in to face accusations they were involved in a cockfighting ring.", "title": "Cockfighting Defendants Flood Court", "url": "http://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/Crowded-Court-Deals-With-Cockfighting-Arrests-260458191.html", "image": "http://media.nbcmiami.com/images/1200*675/042514+cockfighting+suspects+2.jpg?ak=bc", "creator": "@nbc6", "site": "@nbc6", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "tp": {"preferredRuntimes": "Flash,HTML5", "FlashBlacklist": "None|None", "preferredFormats": "mpeg4,m3u,webm,ogg,flv,F4M"}, "fb": {"app_id": 91295312088}, "keywords": "cockfighting, cockfighting ring, ring, cockfighting ring bust, cockfighting bust, francisco ruiz arias, arias", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/NBCMiami"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "cockfighting, cockfighting ring, ring, cockfighting ring bust, cockfighting bust, francisco ruiz arias, arias"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9995\"", "article_summary": "Some defendants face cockfighting related charges while others face charges of selling cocaine, possessing illegal firearms, and animal cruelty.\nCourt documents showed the alleged ring leader of the cockfighting ring, Francisco Ruiz Arias, was arrested 16 years ago on two counts of fighting and baiting animals.\nSome of the dozens of suspects detained at the scene of a massive cockfighting ring bust.\nThe plethora of defendants was arrested a few weeks ago when an undercover narcotics operation at a home on 254th Avenue and 212th Street discovered the cockfighting ring.\nA courtroom in Miami-Dade County was overflowing with defendants Friday as 158 people walked in to face accusations they were involved in a cockfighting ring."}
