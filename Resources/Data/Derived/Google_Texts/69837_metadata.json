Donald Trump has a take on Jonathan Gruber.\n\nDuring his regularly-scheduled Monday Fox & Friends appearance, the Apprentice star was asked for his thoughts on the MIT professor and Obamacare advisor who once said the law only passed because of a \u201clack of transparency\u201d along with \u201cthe stupidity of the American voter.\u201d\n\n\n\nWe needn\u2019t dwell too much on the specifics, but here\u2019s a primer on Trump\u2019s response: Gruber is the real \u201cdummy\u201d here because he didn\u2019t think someone would videotape his remarks.\n\nOh, and Obamacare is a hoax.\n\nAlso, the president and all those involved in the law\u2019s formation are \u201cshady\u201d or perhaps even just \u201cbad\u201d people.\n\nBy the way, Donald might run for president.\n\nThough he won\u2019t say whether he\u2019s actually running. But if he does, he\u2019d undoubtedly be better than any other candidate.\n\nThe world would \u201crespect\u201d America again, okay?\n\nAlso, Mexico is the new China, \u201ctaking our money like it\u2019s coffee\u201d or something.\n\nWatch below, via Fox:\n\nPlease enable Javascript to watch.\n\n[h/t Grabien]\n\n[Image via Fox/screengrab]\n\n\u2014 \u2014\n\n>> Follow Andrew Kirell (@AndrewKirell) on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"description": "Oh, good.
