Getting knocked out during a colonoscopy might seem like a good idea. After all, being awake as your doctor uses a long, flexible tube to get an inside view of your lower intestines doesn't sound very appealing. To avoid that problem, many doctors now routinely use the drug propofol (Diprivan) during colonoscopy to cause deep sedation in their patients.

But beware: That drug, which was reportedly given to Joan Rivers soon before she died, might not be the healthiest choice and could put you at risk for some serious complications.
