It is more than just towers. These wind turbines are important to our economy. Thousands of parts and materials go into each turbine, and dozens of companies are part of the wind supply chain in Colorado.\n\nBach Composite Colorado in Fort Lupton is one of these companies. We currently employ 70 people at our factory, where we manufacture our proprietary composite nacelle covers for companies like Vestas and Siemens. A nacelle is the \u201cbox\u201d that connects the tower to the rotor and contains the generator that helps convert wind into electricity. Compared to the rotors and towers, it is just one small piece of the machine, but it is one piece of many that are proudly made in Colorado, by Coloradans.\n\nBach Composite came to Colorado six years ago because of the state\u2019s leadership on renewables and commitment to clean energy. In 2009, Colorado\u2019s government and utilities were making investments in clean technology and renewables when other states were not \u2014 and Colorado has reaped the benefits. Xcel Energy\u2019s investments in wind have saved its customers about $40 million since 2009. Its data show that states with significant wind-energy development have seen their electricity costs decrease, while states without significant wind energy have seen costs increase. The wind industry has also generated between 6,000 and 7,000 jobs, and landowners with facilities on their property collect about $7.8 million in lease payments annually.\n\nColorado is now the sixth-highest producer of wind energy in the nation. Just as wind energy has grown in Colorado, so has Bach Composite. The speed of that growth hinges in part on certainty of investment.\n\nThe federal wind production tax credit has made a significant and important impact on wind energy in Colorado. The tax credit does not just provide an incentive to buy energy from wind resources. It also provides an economic signal to private investors that they can make sound decisions to invest in the research and development of new technologies that make better, more efficient wind energy components.\n\nIf Congress fails to extend the production tax credit, it would result in significant layoffs and possible company closures in Colorado and across the country. At Bach, we would likely be forced to lay off as many as half of our workers. Failing to extend the tax credit also would mean that technology would not progress at the rate that is necessary if we are to reach our goal of energy independence. A slowdown in investment and development of the wind industry would likely reduce the amount of new wind energy coming onto the market at a time when the cost to produce wind energy is dropping below the cost of traditional energy resources.\n\nIn the past, U.S. energy policy has provided billions of dollars in tax-credit support to traditional fuels, many of which are now permanent fixtures in the tax code, unlike the temporary nature of the wind production tax credit.\n\nBach Composites supports an eventual phase-down of the tax credit. But if the market were provided some certainty as to the timing and duration of the tax credit, history supports the \u201ctheory\u201d that private investment would follow, and Coloradans would continue to have cheaper and cleaner homegrown electricity.\n\nColoradans overwhelmingly support energy production \u2014 both traditional and renewable \u2014 right here in our backyard.\n\nThe wind industry is not asking for a taxpayer handout in perpetuity. It should, however, be extended for a set period of time, enough so that when it does phase out, the wind industry can stay competitive and help drive Colorado\u2019s economy forward with the most innovative technology and best workforce in the nation.\n\nHans Thornberg is plant manager for Bach Composite.\n\n\n\nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Guest Commentary: Don\u2019t let Colo. wind jobs blow away", "title": "Guest Commentary: Don\u2019t let Colo. wind jobs blow away", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/07/17/guest-commentary-dont-let-colo-wind-jobs-blow-away/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150717__OP19THORNBERGp1.jpg", "height": 396}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150717__OP19THORNBERGp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-17T11:42:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T05:59:42+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The federal wind production tax credit has made a significant and important impact on wind energy in Colorado.\nA slowdown in investment and development of the wind industry would likely reduce the amount of new wind energy coming onto the market at a time when the cost to produce wind energy is dropping below the cost of traditional energy resources.\nIts data show that states with significant wind-energy development have seen their electricity costs decrease, while states without significant wind energy have seen costs increase.\nThe wind industry has also generated between 6,000 and 7,000 jobs, and landowners with facilities on their property collect about $7.8 million in lease payments annually.\nThe wind industry is not asking for a taxpayer handout in perpetuity."}
