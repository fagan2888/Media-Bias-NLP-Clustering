Preliminary information released by Guerrero\u2019s Attorney General\u2019s Office shows that the gunmen may have been after donation money that had been collected at the seminary.\n\nThe outrage in Mexico that has led to protests comes after clergy men appear to be easy targets in Mexico; just three months before Father Goyito\u2019s murder unknown gunmen kidnapped and executed Father Ascencion Acuna Osorio in a crime that still remains unsolved.\n\nSimilarly John Ssenyando, a missionary from Uganda who had been working in Guerrero was kidnapped by gunmen in April and his body was found months later in October when federal police officers were searching for mass graves looking for the bodies of 43 education students who were kidnapped by police officers and then executed by cartel members.\n\n\u201cHistorically the church has occasionally found itself in cartel crosshairs, but not as brutally and frequently as in the past few years,\u201d said Breitbart Texas Contributing Editor and Border Expert Sylvia Longmire. \u201cWhile cartels are notorious for eliminating public figures who oppose them and stand in the way of their business practices, more traditional traffickers are still mostly Catholic and prefer to avoid targeting the clergy. However, newer and younger cartel-affiliated gangs seem to have no such qualms, lending credence to the notion that Mexico\u2019s cartels have long evolved beyond the traditional confines of the \u2018organized crime\u2019 label.\u201d\n\nA recently released report by the Multimedia Catholic Center (CCM) noted that since Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto took office, 8 priests have been murdered and two others have never been heard from again.\n\nThe religious group noted in their report released to the Catholic Church that Mexico is the most dangerous country for priests in Latin America with 47 murder attempts on clergy members since 1990. Of those attempts, the victims have been one cardinal, 34 priests, a deacon, 3 brothers, 5 laymen working for the church and a journalist working for a catholic publication.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Outrage in Mexico as Priests Become Targets of Organized Crime", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Outrage in Mexico as Priests Become Targets of Organized Crime", "title": "Outrage in Mexico as Priests Become Targets of Organized Crime", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 511, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-28-at-10.34.22-AM.png", "height": 336}, "updated_time": "2014-12-28T08:39:34-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/texas/2014/12/28/outrage-in-mexico-after-priests-become-targets-of-organized-crime/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Outrage in Mexico as Priests Become Targets of Organized Crime", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-28-at-10.34.22-AM.png", "title": "Outrage in Mexico as Priests Become Targets of Organized Crime", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Cartel, Crime, Mexico, Murder, organized crime, priest,Breitbart Texas,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2014-12-28T08:38:03-07:00", "section": "Breitbart Texas", "modified_time": "2014-12-28T08:39:34-07:00", "tag": "priest", "categories": "Breitbart Texas"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1e60\"", "article_summary": "The outrage in Mexico that has led to protests comes after clergy men appear to be easy targets in Mexico; just three months before Father Goyito\u2019s murder unknown gunmen kidnapped and executed Father Ascencion Acuna Osorio in a crime that still remains unsolved.\nThe religious group noted in their report released to the Catholic Church that Mexico is the most dangerous country for priests in Latin America with 47 murder attempts on clergy members since 1990.\nOf those attempts, the victims have been one cardinal, 34 priests, a deacon, 3 brothers, 5 laymen working for the church and a journalist working for a catholic publication.\nSadly enough authorities later discovered the body of Father Goyito with a single gunshot wound to the head in a case that still remains unsolved.\nPreliminary information released by Guerrero\u2019s Attorney General\u2019s Office shows that the gunmen may have been after donation money that had been collected at the seminary."}
