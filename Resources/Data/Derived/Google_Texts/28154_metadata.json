The anonymous survey is easy to complete and focuses on the respondent\u2019s perception of the health issues facing our communities, as well as their own overall health and conditions. It should take no longer than five minutes to complete.\n\nThe survey is available online through June 5 at www.adena.org/chna.\n\nPaper copies are available at Adena Health System, the Ross County Health District, the Hunger Coalition, and Scioto Paint Valley facilities. A link to the survey can also be found through many of these Partners for a Healthier Ross County\u2019s social media outlets.\n\nThe Community Needs Assessment is conducted by all 501(c)(3) hospitals as required by the Affordable Care Act every three years.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://ohne.ws/1TFMtdM", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "A requirement of Obamacare, local coalition seeks input through anonymous survey", "og": {"site_name": "Chillicothe Gazette", "description": "A requirement of Obamacare, local coalition seeks input through anonymous survey", "title": "Health survey helps direct community resources", "url": "http://www.chillicothegazette.com/story/news/local/2016/05/23/health-survey-helps-direct-community-resources/84776560/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/chillicothegazette.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A requirement of Obamacare, local coalition seeks input through anonymous survey", "creator": "@chilligaz", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e8c26da9ef6263c92fa64f81ddab53767b675bcc/c=0-0-2040-2040&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/05/23/Chillicothe/B9322281822Z.1_20160523105155_000_G1LEFEI3S.1-0.jpg", "title": "Health survey helps direct community resources", "site": "@chilligaz", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=895152179", "fb": {"app_id": 185597654790970}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "Buy Photo Gazette file photoAs a faith-based health system, Adena Health System does not perform any type of abortion procedures.\nPaper copies are available at Adena Health System, the Ross County Health District, the Hunger Coalition, and Scioto Paint Valley facilities.\nAdena Medical Center (Photo: Gazette file photo)Buy PhotoCHILLICOTHE \u2013 Adena Health System, working in conjunction with Partners for a Healthier Ross County, is urging Ross County residents to complete the 2016 Community Health Survey.\nThe survey is intended to help the Health System and local agencies identify the most prominent health needs of people living in Ross County.\nA link to the survey can also be found through many of these Partners for a Healthier Ross County\u2019s social media outlets."}
