Charges of felony sex abuse have been dropped against Joshua Dolezal, the Central College associate English professor and brother of Rachel Dolezal. As the former NAACP president in Spokane, Wash., Rachel made national headlines last month for misrepresenting herself as black though she is white. She subsequently resigned.

Tom Kelly, a spokesman for Colorado's Fifth Judicial District Attorney's Office said the case against Joshua, which involved four felony counts of sexual abuse of a minor, was dismissed on Monday. It was scheduled to go to trial in August. Kelly was unable to offer further details.

Joshua's wife, Amy Palanjian, released a statement from her husband that said: "My family and I are grateful that these false allegations have been dismissed and that justice has prevailed. We are thankful to our family, friends, neighbors, and colleagues who have supported us throughout this ordeal, and we are so happy to once again face the future with hope."

The charges against Joshua Dolezal, 39, were made in Colorado in 2013. The incidents were alleged to have taken place in the family home between 2001 and 2002 against a then-minor girl of 6 or 7 who is a relative. The Dolezal parents have identified Rachel as being behind the charges — which they have called false — and an adopted daughter, who is black as being the subject of them. The parents were the ones who first disclosed that Rachel was actually white.

In a statement released to the Register in June, Palanjian blamed Dolezal's "sisters' lies for hurting an innocent man and his family" and for doing "a disservice to all true victims of sexual abuse."
