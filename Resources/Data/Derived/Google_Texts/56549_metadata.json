In the meantime, 26 companies have followed suit.\n\nThese 26 for-profit companies, less than half of the more than 100 entities that are currently challenging the mandatory coverage of birth control, have also won the right to stop paying for their employees\u2019 birth control. Twenty-five more for-profits are on well on their way to doing the same thing.\n\nThe Hobby Lobby decision was a game changer\u2014not because it allowed one company to get out of a specific mandate, but because it provided the blueprint for others to do the same.\n\nThe entire debate dates back to August 1, 2011, when a provision was added to the Affordable Care Act requiring companies to cover preventive health services for women (as outlined by the Department of Health and Human Services) at no upfront cost. Under a podium that read: \u201cSimply Being a Woman Is No Longer a Pre-existing Condition,\u201d HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius celebrated the decision with a victorious crowd on the day it took effect, exactly one year later.\n\nFor companies like Hobby Lobby, with a strong religious foundation in opposition to contraceptive methods, this was the beginning of a big fight\u2014one that most, it seems, will win.\n\nThe Oklahoma-city based Hobby Lobby was one of more than 100 companies\u2014both nonprofit and for-profit\u2014to file a lawsuit in federal court challenging the contraceptive mandate, but the craft store\u2019s was by far the biggest. In July, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Hobby Lobby, deciding that a closely held company (i.e. corporations in which six or fewer individuals own more than 50 percent of the stock), could opt out of the mandate for religious reasons.\n\nAt the time of the July ruling, 82 lawsuits brought by similar entities had been stayed by courts pending the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling on Hobby Lobby. Gretchen Borchelt, senior counsel and director of state reproductive health policy for the National Women\u2019s Law Center (NWLC), explained it to The Daily Beast in June. \u201cOther closely held companies now have a license to harm their employees in the name of the company\u2019s religion,\u201d said Borchelt. \u201cIf companies qualify, they can use this decision to make the same claim.\u201d\n\nSix months after we spoke, more than two-dozen have successfully qualified, and won the same exemption. This leaves thousands of women at companies across the United States left to pay out of pocket for their birth control. In a Supreme Court brief from NWLC, the average cost of oral contraception for one woman over the course of five years is listed as $2,630. Injectable contraceptives or vaginal rings cost even more, at upwards of $2,700.\n\nLeila Abolfazli, senior counsel for NWLC who is currently covering this issue, says the decisions are having a \u201creal impact\u201d on women nationwide. \u201cPaying out of pocket for some women may be impossible because they don't have the income\u2014or for some, it may be that they can\u2019t afford the right one,\u201d Abolfazli tells The Daily Beast. \u201cIt\u2019s a full range of problems.\u201d\n\nOn the \u201cCover Her\u201d helpline, dedicated to assisting women with healthcare coverage, Abolfazli says there has been an influx of calls on this issue. \u201cThere\u2019s just this feeling that comes through that it\u2019s really unfair,\u201d she says. \u201cDepending on your employer, you have different rights.\u201d\n\nEven for those who can make ends meet enough to purchase the birth control, the pressure of having to pay out of pocket still has implications. A Guttmacher study) from 2009 found that high costs of contraception lead women to \u201cforego [it] completely, to choose less effective methods, or to use [it] inconsistently or incorrectly.\u201d\n\nWhile the Hobby Lobby decision may have lost its cultural appeal, it still carries weight in the federal court system. The 26 companies who have followed in the craft store\u2019s footsteps are now under no obligation to pay for their female employee\u2019s birth control.
