Inmates at an Alabama prison stabbed their warden and a correctional officer, started a fire in a hallway and posted pictures of the mayhem on social media during a riot, authorities said.

The unrest at the William C. Holman Correctional Facility was over by Saturday morning, and the injuries to warden Carter Davenport and the officer are not believed to be life-threatening, Alabama Department of Corrections spokesman Bob Horton said in a news release.

The violence began Friday around 9:15 p.m., when the officer responded to a fight between inmates in one of the prison's dorms. The officer was stabbed when he tried to detain one of the fighting inmates, Horton said.

When Davenport and other officers entered the dorm, Davenport was stabbed, Horton said.

Horton didn't say what weapon was used. Davenport was treated for his injuries at the prison, located about 45 miles northeast of Mobile. The officer was treated at a medical facility elsewhere, the corrections department said.

Details about their injuries weren't immediately available.
