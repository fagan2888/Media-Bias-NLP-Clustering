(Courtesy photo)\n\nOn the web You can find Lon's Little Shop at 2037 13th St., Boulder, and lonlittleshop.com.\n\nIf you've got it, don't flaunt it.\n\nThat's one way Boulder does wealth. That grungy dude on his bike wearing ratty fleece is quite possibly a ten-millionaire.\n\nThis movement is slowly spreading \u2014 although the cowboys driving Ford F-950s decked with steel testicles in Greeley still haven't read the message (but then, they're begging to be their own state, or was it planet?).\n\nThe trend has materialized in the form of a teeny, tiny little shop in downtown, just off Pearl Street: Lon's Little Shop.\n\nLon's is proud of its minimalism, a small selection and a limited supply of hard-to-find goodies. All in 300 wee square feet.\n\nNot exactly the Costco-esque mentality that traditionally prevails in Go'merica.\n\nIn fact, this kind of \"curiosity boutique\" is rare in this country, but growing in popularity, says owner Lon McGowen, of Boulder. You can find a few in L.A., Seattle and Brooklyn, but it's more like something you'd stumble across in Hong Kong, he says.\n\n\"It's like a museum store that's more approachable,\" McGowen says. \"It's not Fab.com, but that idea has spurred a lot of design-conscious shoppers in the U.S. who love purely the aesthetic of a product.\"\n\nAt Lon's, you can find everything from odd geometric-influenced head-shaped bookends, to delicate bowls that look like broken eggs filled with air plants, to the most perfect, sleek and classic black umbrellas.\n\nBut you'll find only a few of each thing.\n\nIt's anti-bling. A bit of a middle finger to consumerism and excess (albeit in retail form). In March, Lon's is releasing its own Lon Little Speaker, a 2-by-2-inch mobile bluetooth speaker \u2014 with a spotlight on quality, not size.\n\nA broken egg bowl with hassle-free air plant, $15. (Courtesy photo)\n\nMcGowen expects Boulder to eat it right up. He's shocked by the success of his shop, and he laughs when he says it must have the greatest ratio of sales-per-square-foot in the area.\n\nMaybe it's a stretch toward simplicity, or even humility. Or maybe it's just perfectionism. After all, McGowen describes himself as a \"neurotically particular\" shopper.\n\n\"I've always appreciated constraints, both in design and in business,\" McGowen says.\n\n\"A constraint of size in a shop like this is good because it forces the perfection of curation. That's what this whole shop is about.\"\n\nContact Staff Writer Aimee Heckel at 303-473-1359, heckela@dailycamera.com or twitter.com/@Aimeemay.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/lifestyles/ci_24937091/lons-little-shop-boulder-boutique-hard-find-goodies", "sailthru.author": "By Aimee Heckel  Camera Staff Writer", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:24937091:view"}, "startDate": "2014-01-19T09:18:03-0700", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "Lon's Little Shop is a \"curiosity boutique,\" something you'd expect to find in L.A., Seattle, Brooklyn and Hong Kong.", "title": "Could a 300-square-foot shop be Boulder's next big thing?", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/lifestyles/ci_24937091/lons-little-shop-boulder-boutique-hard-find-goodies", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2014/0117/20140117__19dcphec_TEST~6.jpg", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Lifestyles", "modificationDate": "2014-01-19T09:29:33-0700", "endDate": "2024-01-17T17:58:26-0700", "news_keywords": "Lifestyles, Lifestyles news, Boulder Colorado Lifestyles news, Boulder Colorado news, Lifestyles Boulder news, Lifestyles Colorado news, US Lifestyles news, world Lifestyles news.", "byline": "By Aimee Heckel", "pubDate": "2014-01-19T09:30:55-0700", "sailthru.date": "2014-01-19T09:18:03-0700", "sailthru.title": "Could a 300-square-foot shop be Boulder's next big thing?", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2014/0117/20140117__19dcphec_TEST~6_300.jpg", "description": "Lon's Little Shop is a \"curiosity boutique,\" something you'd expect to find in L.A., Seattle, Brooklyn and Hong Kong.", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/lifestyles/ci_24937091/lons-little-shop-boulder-boutique-hard-find-goodies", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "Lon's Little Shop is a \"curiosity boutique,\" something you'd expect to find in L.A., Seattle, Brooklyn and Hong Kong.", "title": "Could a 300-square-foot shop be Boulder's next big thing?"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2014/0117/20140117__19dcphec_TEST~6.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3cf4\"", "article_summary": "The trend has materialized in the form of a teeny, tiny little shop in downtown, just off Pearl Street: Lon's Little Shop.\n(Courtesy photo)On the web You can find Lon's Little Shop at 2037 13th St., Boulder, and lonlittleshop.com.\nIt's available at Lon's Little Shop in Boulder.\nIn March, Lon's is releasing its own Lon Little Speaker, a 2-by-2-inch mobile bluetooth speaker \u2014 with a spotlight on quality, not size.\n\"A constraint of size in a shop like this is good because it forces the perfection of curation."}
