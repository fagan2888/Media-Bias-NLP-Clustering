The process is expected to take most if not all of the month.\n\nThe Nuggets are looking to replace Brian Shaw, who was fired in the second half of the season. Their list of candidates is believed to include, but is not limited to Melvin Hunt, who took over as interim head coach when Shaw was fired; former NBA head coach Mike D\u2019Antoni; Golden State assistant coach Alvin Gentry; and Scott Brooks, recently fired as Oklahoma City coach. The Nuggets are looking for a coach who will institute a fast-paced style.\n\nWorking in the Nuggets\u2019 favor is that there is only one other vacancy, in Orlando, and there is a deep pool of candidates who are interested. The search contrasts with what happened two years after the Nuggets fired George Karl. Multiple teams were in search of head coaches and the overall field of candidates was more limited.\n\nRELATED: Will the Nuggets talk to Scott Brooks in their coaching search?\n\nThe Nuggets are expected to travel to meet most of their potential coaching targets rather than bring them into town. The coaching decision will be made by general manager Tim Connelly and team president Josh Kroenke.\n\nFor the past few weeks management has been focused on scouting and getting ready for the draft.\n\nChristopher Dempsey: cdempsey@denverpost.com or twitter.com/dempseypost", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Denver Nuggets get down to full-time coaching search this week", "title": "Denver Nuggets get down to full-time coaching search this week", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/05/05/denver-nuggets-get-down-to-full-time-coaching-search-this-week/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150505_092222_melvin-hunt.jpg", "height": 470}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150505_092222_melvin-hunt.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-05T09:34:33+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-23T11:16:21+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "RELATED: Will the Nuggets talk to Scott Brooks in their coaching search?\nThe search contrasts with what happened two years after the Nuggets fired George Karl.\nThis week, expect the Nuggets to turn up the heat on their search for a new coach.\nThe Nuggets are looking to replace Brian Shaw, who was fired in the second half of the season.\nThe Nuggets are expected to travel to meet most of their potential coaching targets rather than bring them into town."}
