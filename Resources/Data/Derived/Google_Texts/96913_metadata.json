He went on to say, \u201cAnyone who is going to establish a Palestinian state, anyone who is going to evacuate territories today, is simply giving a base for attacks to the radical Islam against Israel.\u201d\n\nRelated: As Israel Votes, Netanyahu Issues Dire Warnings\n\nHe contrasted himself with the left-leaning Zionist Union candidates, whom he accused of \u201csticking their head in the sand, time and time again.\u201d\n\nHowever, Netanyahu\u2019s tone had dramatically changed by the time he sat down for an interview with NBC\u2019s Andrea Mitchell on Thursday.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want a one-state solution,\u201d he said. \u201cI want a sustainable, peaceful two-state solution. But for that, circumstances have to change.\u201d\n\nNetanyahu insisted that he was not contradicting himself, and that none of his remarks prior to the election were in conflict with his support \u2014 at least in theory \u2014 for a two-state solution, which he first voiced in 2009. \u201cEvery territory that is vacated in the Middle East today is taken up by Islamist forces,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want that to change so we can realize a vision of real, sustained peace.\u201d\n\nRelated: Netanyahu\u2019s 3 Major Hurdles in Israel\u2019s Elections\n\nHe continued, \u201cWe need the conditions of recognition of a Jewish state and real security in order to have a realistic two-state solution,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I was talking about what is achievable and what is not achievable. To make it achievable then you have to have real negotiations with people who are committed to peace. We are. It\u2019s time we saw the pressure on the Palestinians to show that they are committed too.\u201d\n\nMitchell also asked Netanyahu about his election-day warning to the Israeli right that Arab voters were turning out \u201cin droves,\u201d and would subvert the will of the Israeli people if they weren\u2019t countered by strong right-wing turnout. Netanyahu came under worldwide criticism for those remarks, which seemed to imply that Israel\u2019s Arab citizens are not true Israelis.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very proud to be the prime minister of all of Israel\u2019s citizens, Arabs and Jews alike,\u201d Netanyahu said. \u201cI\u2019m very proud that Israel is the only country in a very broad radius in which Arabs have free and fair elections. That\u2019s sacrosanct. That will never change.\u201d\n\nRelated: How Iran Is Taking Over the Middle East\n\nIt is unclear whether Netanyahu\u2019s change of tune is simply a walking-back of cynical pre-election rhetoric or a response to pressure from abroad \u2014 particularly Washington.\n\nIn the days following the election, the White House has sharply criticized Netanyahu\u2019s remarks about his Arab citizens, saying the Obama administration was \u201cdeeply troubled\u201d by them. His apparent abandonment of the two-state solution in his pre-election comments also removed one of the justifications the U.S. has used for protecting Israel from pro-Palestinian proposals in the United Nations.\n\nIn the wake of the election, White House officials reportedly said the administration is \u201creassessing\u201d the U.S.-Israel relationship. That, by itself, might have been enough to encourage Netanyahu to begin moderating his stance.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Not two days after his Likud Party won Israel\u2019s parliamentary elections, in part on a promise to the hard right that he would \u201cnever\u201d allow a Palestinian state, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday that he in fact does support a \u201ctwo-state\u201d solution.", "title": "Netanyahu\u2019s Flip Flop: Now He Wants a \u2018Peaceful Two-State Solution\u2019", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/19/Netanyahu-s-Flip-Flop-Now-He-Wants-Peaceful-Two-State-Solution", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/columns/03032015_Netanyahu.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/19/Netanyahu-s-Flip-Flop-Now-He-Wants-Peaceful-Two-State-Solution", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/columns/03032015_Netanyahu.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@rrgarver"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Not two days after his Likud Party won Israel\u2019s parliamentary elections, in part on a promise to the hard right that he would \u201cnever\u201d allow a Palestinian state, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday that he in fact does support a \u201ctwo-state\u201d solution.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1203\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI want a sustainable, peaceful two-state solution.\nHis apparent abandonment of the two-state solution in his pre-election comments also removed one of the justifications the U.S. has used for protecting Israel from pro-Palestinian proposals in the United Nations.\nIn the days following the election, the White House has sharply criticized Netanyahu\u2019s remarks about his Arab citizens, saying the Obama administration was \u201cdeeply troubled\u201d by them.\nNetanyahu came under worldwide criticism for those remarks, which seemed to imply that Israel\u2019s Arab citizens are not true Israelis.\n\u201cI\u2019m very proud to be the prime minister of all of Israel\u2019s citizens, Arabs and Jews alike,\u201d Netanyahu said."}
