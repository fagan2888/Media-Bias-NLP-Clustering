The typical hospital bill makes the untranslatable Voynich manuscript seem like a child\u2019s grade-school reader by comparison.\n\nSuch complexity is partly owing to a simple fact: Much of the market is managed by huge, bureaucratic organizations that employ thousands of people to do nothing all day but grind through minutiae. This leads to things like the ICD-10, a diagnostic coding system that governs the classification and reporting of diseases and injuries.\n\nWith 16,000 different codes, the ICD-10 gets rather specific. Was the patient struck by a turtle? Enter code W5922XA. Was she struck by a sea lion? That\u2019s a separate code\u2014W5612XA. Code S30867A covers nonvenemous insect bites to the anus. There\u2019s one code for assault with a hockey stick, another for assault with a baseball bat. And then there is V91.07XA, for patients who have been burned by flaming water skis. (Burned by flaming water skis a second time? That\u2019s V91.06XD.)\n\nAmerican health care providers must update from ICD-9 to ICD-10 this year. It says so right in the Federal Register, under a rule titled \u201cAdministrative Simplification.\u201d\n\nDrug pricing represents another area that seems to have been designed by a circus clown on quaaludes. Most products drop in price over time as new and better ones come on the market. Not so for some drugs. Take Avonex, a prescription drug for multiple sclerosis. According to a piece in Bloomberg Businessweek, prescriptions for Avonex have been declining\u2014while its price has more than doubled. The price for Gleevex, a drug used to treat leukemia, has risen from about $118 per pill seven years ago to more than $300 now.\n\nIndeed, prices for numerous drugs have shot up in recent years by twofold, fourfold and even more. And that doesn\u2019t even count new wonder drugs such as Sovaldi, the life-saving hepatitis drug that costs $84,000 for a 12-week course, or Kalydeco, a treatment for cystic fibrosis that costs more than $300,000 per year.\n\nThere are various explanations for such eye-popping charges. Pharmaceutical companies spend billions of dollars a year on research, and they need to recoup that money. If they don\u2019t, then the stream of new wonder drugs eventually will dry up. But R&D is not the sole explanation, especially regarding those drugs whose prices suddenly jump after they\u2019ve been on the market for years.\n\nOther factors include pharmaceutical industry consolidation, which leads to larger companies with more bargaining clout, and a federal law, much in need of repeal, that prevents one of the largest market participants\u2014Medicare\u2014from haggling. Confronted with a useful drug that carries an outlandish price, Medicare has two choices: take it or leave it.\n\nThen there\u2019s the patent-and-exclusivity system, which allows drug companies to recoup the costs of developing a drug by granting them exclusive sales rights for only a limited time. The exclusivity period for orphan drugs\u2014those created to address rare conditions\u2014lasts only 7 years, for example.\n\nIn 2013, drug companies lost more than $19 billion when patents expired and competitors started replicating various treatments. By a remarkable coincidence, the industry collected $20 billion by marking up other prescription drugs.\n\nSky-high prices present a serious dilemma: How much should people pay, or be forced to pay, for life-saving and life-changing treatments?\n\nInsurance spreads the cost around. For run-of-the-mill prescriptions, co-payments usually constitute a fixed dollar amount, such as $25. For some advanced and expensive drugs, insurers have been asking policyholders to pay a percentage, such as 25 percent. For a drug that costs thousands of dollars, that can put a big dent in the patient\u2019s bank account.\n\nAccording to some, there oughtta be a law against that. And in a few states, such as New York and Vermont, there is. Del. Jennifer McClellan would like Virginia to have one, too. The Richmond Democrat has introduced a bill that would forbid insurance companies to charge more than a $100-per-month co-payment for such specialty drugs.\n\nThis seems an odd way to go about addressing the problem of high drug prices, which is not caused by insurance companies. In fact, the legislation is likely to make the problem worse, not better, by hiding the true prices of the drugs instead of bringing them down.\n\nLike the flat rate at an all-you-can-eat buffet, flat co-payments are an invitation to overconsume. A patient asked to pay 10 percent of a drug\u2019s price will object if the price doubles. But a patient who pays no more than $100 regardless of the price won\u2019t care.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, pharmaceutical companies often know they can jack up prices without fear that insurers will drop coverage for a particular drug\u2014because Obamacare requires prescription-drug coverage, and each state sets the formulary determining which drugs must be included. That robs insurance companies of bargaining leverage against drug companies. Allowing insurers to choose what they cover would help solve the drug-price problem.\n\nProponents of McClellan\u2019s bill say people shouldn\u2019t have to choose between paying for medicine and paying for food. That\u2019s like saying people shouldn\u2019t have to choose between paying for clothes and paying for shelter. It sounds high-minded, but it ignores economic reality.\n\nCapping co-payments doesn\u2019t lower prices one cent\u2014it simply forces some people to pay more so others don\u2019t have to. In the process, it renders the health-care market even more opaque and obscure.\n\nThey should have an ICD-10 code for that, too.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "The price system works.
