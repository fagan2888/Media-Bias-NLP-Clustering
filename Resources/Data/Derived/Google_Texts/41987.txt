TGIF, the 177th day of 2015 and eight days after a purported white segregationist allegedly pulled out a weapon and gunned down nine unarmed African- American worshippers at Emmanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina. On Friday, President Barack Obama delivers what’s likely to be a powerful eulogy for one of the victims, Rev. Clementa Pinckney, Emmanuel’s pastor, a Palmetto State senator and personal friend of the president and his wife. But Obama’s also likely to deliver another message to the nation on race, a topic that has dominated the headlines in the wake of the Charleston shootings -- including Obama’s use of the n-word in an interview Monday -- and framed his time in office, for good and ill. Here is your Three Minute Briefing, all the News You Can Use in less time than it takes to read the Emancipation Proclamation:
