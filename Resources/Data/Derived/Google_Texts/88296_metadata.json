This approach helps to strengthen and preserve the Ojibwe language, but challenges can arise in developing terminology for all school subjects.\n\n\u201cA lot of the verbiage needed to teach in the immersion school setting is kind of rare and hard to access,\u201d Sullivan explained. Tanner and Sullivan will use the funds to work with Ojibwe elders to put together a series of 12-15 webinars created by and for immersion school teachers.\n\nThe webinars will cover a variety of topics appropriate for elementary school teachers, from dealing with unruly students to basic mathematics, culturally appropriate word problems, and basic reading and writing.\n\nOnce complete, the webinars will be available for free on St. Scholastica\u2019s website.\n\nSullivan said that there are Ojibwe immersion schools emerging all around the region, from the Twin Cities and Michigan to Ontario, Canada. This makes the webinars a key resource for new schools and educators.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to provide some support for teachers who don\u2019t have the opportunity or the time to put in all of the footwork,\u201d Sullivan said.\n\nThe initiative is just the latest achievement for St. Scholastica\u2019s well-regarded Native Teacher program, which has graduated some of the area\u2019s top immersion school teachers.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a really huge contribution to a massive need everywhere in the revitalization movement,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Faculty members at The College of St. Scholastica have received support to develop educational materials to help preserve the Ojibwe language.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/02/22/grants-will-help-ojibwe-language-preservation-efforts-159213", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/college-of-st-scholastica.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Grants Will Help Ojibwe Language Preservation Efforts"}, "abstract": "Faculty members at The College of St. Scholastica have received support to develop educational materials to help preserve the Ojibwe language.", "dc": {"title": "Grants Will Help Ojibwe Language Preservation Efforts"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/02/22/grants-will-help-ojibwe-language-preservation-efforts-159213", "dcterms.creator": "leeanne", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "College of St. Scholastica, Ojibwe Language, Native American Language Preservation, Native American Languages", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.date": "2015-02-22T15:00-05:00", "dcterms.title": "Grants Will Help Ojibwe Language Preservation Efforts"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe029a\"", "article_summary": "The project will provide resources to teachers in Ojibwe language immersion schools, where students learn primary school subjects in Ojibwe.\nMichael Sullivan, assistant professor of Ojibwe, and Valerie Tanner, assistant professor of Ojibwe, were recently awarded $46,000 for their \u201cOjibwe Curriculum for Immersion School Teachers\u201d project.\nSullivan said that there are Ojibwe immersion schools emerging all around the region, from the Twin Cities and Michigan to Ontario, Canada.\nFaculty members at The College of St. Scholastica have received support to develop educational materials to help preserve the Ojibwe language.\nThe initiative is just the latest achievement for St. Scholastica\u2019s well-regarded Native Teacher program, which has graduated some of the area\u2019s top immersion school teachers."}
