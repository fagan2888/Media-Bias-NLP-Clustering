Republicans are pouncing on the allegation that MSNBC producers edited Georgia\u2019s Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate Michelle Nunn\u2019s response to a question about the Affordable Care Act to make it seem more nuanced and conservative.\n\n\u201cRepublicans need six seats to win back the Senate, and Nunn could be the key to preventing that,\u201d said NBC News reporter Kasie Hunt in an introduction to a packaged profile on Nunn that aired on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe. \u201cBut, sometimes, it\u2019s hard to tell she is a Democrat.\u201d\n\nWhen Hunt asked Nunn if she would have voted for the ACA, the Democratic candidate launched into a reply that dodged the question. Hunt pressed her to respond with a yes or no answer, to which Nunn replied, \u201cI think it\u2019s impossible to look back retrospectively and say, \u2018What would you have done if you were there?\u2019\u201d\n\nPlease enable Javascript to watch.\n\nWell, that\u2019s not exactly Nunn\u2019s position. Slate\u2019s Dave Weigel noticed that conservative groups had begun sending out Nunn\u2019s clip on Morning Joe along with the accusation that she had refused to take a position on the ACA. Weigel learned that Nunn\u2019s campaign had also taped the interview, as is standard practice, and the transcript Nunn\u2019s campaign provided him showed that she did take a position on the ACA (Bolding via Weigel to illustrate the portions which aired on MSNBC):\n\nHUNT: But you\u2019re not sure if you would have voted yes or no?\n\nNUNN: When I look back at what they were doing when this was passed, I think, I wish that we had more people who had tried to architect a bipartisan legislation. And who had worked together across the aisle.\n\nHUNT: So, yes or no?\n\nNUNN: I think it\u2019s impossible to look back retrospectively and say, \u201cWhat would you have done if you were there?\u201d Because I wasn\u2019t there, and we now have hindsight. What I can do is say: Here\u2019s where we are today, and here\u2019s what we should do, which is move forward.\n\nHUNT: So do you think it should be repealed?\n\nNUNN: I do not.\n\nNunn clearly said she would oppose the ACA\u2019s repeal, placing her firmly in line with the majority of the members of her party.\n\nWhen Nunn joined MSNBC host Joy Reid later in the day on Monday, the Democratic Senate candidate was again pressed on her position on the ACA and why she refuses to take a stand on the contentious health care law on her website. Nunn delivered another vague reply in which she only backed the expansion of Medicaid in Georgia.\n\nPlease enable Javascript to watch.\n\nWas there more to Nunn\u2019s answer there as well?\n\nEdits like those done to Nunn can be innocuous and may simply have been made in order to package the interview to meet broadcast time constraints. Even if this was true, however, the practical effect of those edits made Nunn seem slightly more in line with Georgia\u2019s voters on the Affordable Care Act rather than the national Democratic Party. As the transcript that Nunn\u2019s campaign provided Weigel shows, she is far more in tune with her party\u2019s position on the ACA than MSNBC\u2019s interview made it appear.\n\nMediaite reached out to MSNBC for comment on this matter but had not received a reply prior to this publication. This post will be updated with MSNBC\u2019s response.\n\nUPDATE: Responding to Mediaite\u2019s inquiry, an MSNBC spokesperson says that the edits were made in order to comport with broadcast time constraints and not to remove content from Nunn\u2019s interview with Hunt. The full video of Nunn\u2019s comments on the ACA have been posted to MSNBC.com.\n\nCorrection May 20, 10:25 a.m.: An earlier version of this post linked RNC spokesman Sean Spicer\u2018s criticism of Kasie Hunt to the edits made to the Nunn story. Spicer\u2019s criticism of MSNBC and Hunt was unrelated to the edits in question.\n\n[Image via screengrab]\n\n\u2014 \u2014\n\n>> Follow Noah Rothman (@NoahCRothman) on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"description": "There is another editing controversy brewing at MSNBC.
