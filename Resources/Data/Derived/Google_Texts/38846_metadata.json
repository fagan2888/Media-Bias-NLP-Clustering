But as an economic conservative, I urge Super Tuesday voters to give Bernie a closer look.\n\nOn some key areas of policy, his views should be attractive to disaffected voters on both the left and right, who together \u2014 as demonstrated by Donald Trump\u2019s and Sanders\u2019 strong challenges to political establishments in the primaries\u2014likely constitute a majority of the general electorate.\n\nIncreasing the economy is monopolized. For example, prices for medical procedures and insurance are much higher in locales where the Affordable Care Act has permitted hospitals and insurance companies to enjoy limited competition.\n\nGermans pay about a third less for health care\u2014and Britain nearly half\u2014than Americans. Obamacare didn\u2019t make it cheaper but instead imposes terrible bureaucratic burdens and requires too many young people to purchase coverage with huge deductibles they cannot afford.\n\nBush Care, which mainstream Republicans want to resurrect with tax deductions and other gimmicks, left too many people without insurance, because sometimes the free market doesn\u2019t work very well.\n\nLike it or not, sometimes, the government has to create a regulated public utility or do the job itself. A single payer in the model of Britain, as both Sanders and Trump have advocated, may be the only way to relieve the hassles and rein in high costs.\n\nIn the wake of the 2008 financial meltdown, Dodd-Frank has not limited the power of the big banks. Instead it has imposed mindless reporting burdens onto community banks\u2014who didn\u2019t cause the crisis in the first place. Now small businesses can\u2019t get loans and create enough jobs.\n\nBig banks are absorbing smaller regional banks, gambling with our deposits on commodities and foreign exchange, and stuffing executives pockets with huge bonuses.\n\nBernie\u2019s got it right on the big banks\u2014bust them up and instigate more competition\n\nHis skepticism of free trade\u2014supported by many moderates in both parties\u2014is well founded. With Republican support, President Obama implemented a free trade pact with South Korea that has ballooned the bilateral trade deficit and killed 130,000 jobs.\n\nOverall, badly implemented trade deals are costing Americans some 4 million jobs.\n\nCertainly, I find many of Bernie\u2019s redistributionist policies too expensive and badly conceived.\n\nSoak the rich taxes and free tuition won\u2019t fix income inequality.\n\nAggressive taxes could easily drive more businesses off shore and make everyone poorer in the bargain.\n\nWe hardly need to send everyone to college. The problem with higher education is not access but high prices\u2014more subsidies won\u2019t fix that.\n\nHowever, the country is already spending a ton on national health care. It\u2019s really a problem of redirecting that money to a national health care agency\u2014businesses and ordinary folks may be paying more taxes to fund it but they will get to skip those huge health insurance premiums, co-pays and deductibles.\n\nBanks have proven too big to regulate and their huge political contributions have motivated federal antitrust cops to turn a blind eye to their abusive behavior.\n\nAfter taking huge federal subsidies to build a green factory in Indiana, Carrier is moving operations to Mexico. You got to admit, its executives know how to mine the system but workers and taxpayers get the shaft.\n\nI would prefer any of the Republicans to Hillary Clinton. She is too tainted by acts of questionable integrity, too beholden to powerful business interests that are bilking ordinary Americans and fighting battles long ago won\u2014young women now receive 60 percent of college degrees, often earn more than young men and increasingly are assuming positions of leadership throughout society.\n\nBernie is straightforward and honest. He learned about the dreams of ordinary people the same place I did\u2014playing stickball on the streets of New York.\n\nHe\u2019s a sweetheart.\n\nPeter Morici is an economist and business professor at the University of Maryland, and a national columnist.
