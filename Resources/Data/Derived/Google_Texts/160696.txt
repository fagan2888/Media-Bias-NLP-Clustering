Alcohol, speed not considered a factor in the pedestrian-vehicle accident

A Florence man died after he was struck by a vehicle on Colo. 115 early Saturday morning.

The Colorado State Patrol said Cord McClure, 26, was hit at about 5:30 a.m. while walking on Colo. 15, about three miles west of Florence.

A press release issued Saturday by the CSP stated a 2011 Dodge Ram 1500 driven by Brad Cochran, 25, of Ca√±on City, was traveling eastbound when the Dodge struck McClure, who was walking eastbound in the eastbound lane, wearing dark-colored clothing on an unlighted portion of the highway.

The release stated Cochran was wearing his seat belt at the time of the crash and was uninjured. McClure was pronounced deceased on scene by Fremont County Coroner Carlette Brocious.

Alcohol and speed are not considered factors in the crash, the CSP reported, but the crash remains under investigation at his time.
