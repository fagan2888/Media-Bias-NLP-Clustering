Joined by the Boys and Girls Club Lauderdale County and other workers, campers went through eight different football drills throughout the morning before concluding the day with races to determine the fastest campers. Though the NFL linebacker was born and raised in Houston, Texas, the rest of his family resides in Meridian where he frequently visited during his summers as a boy.\n\nRobertson said he just wanted to give back to the city.\n\n\"My dad's from this area. He grew up in Redline,\u201d said Robertson. \u201cI've been coming here since I was a kid. I never saw any camp interaction, but always played sports when I was here during the Summer. And my dad and my uncle said, 'Hey! What better place to come back and have camp than Meridian?'\"\n\nRobertson says he plans to bring the camp back to Meridian next Summer.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "An estimated 170 young athletes took part in the first Craig Robertson football camp at Meridian High School.
