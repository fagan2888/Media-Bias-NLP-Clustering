The top two seeds can be determined in the AFC and the NFC. The Jets are in a nearly must-win situation for a playoff berth, while the Patriots can lock up the AFC\u2019s best record and home-field advantage. The Cardinals and Packers have locked up playoff slots, but their game is about a shot at a first-round bye.\n\nGame of the week:\n\nPackers (10-4) at Cardinals (12-2); 2:25 p.m., KDVR-31\n\nArizona has arguably the best offense in football to go with its turnover-causing defense. The Packers haven\u2019t looked right all season, but they\u2019re in the driver\u2019s seat for the NFC North title.\n\nPatriots (12-2) at Jets (9-5), 11 a.m.\n\nThe Jets, who have won four straight, have the type of defense that has given the Patriots fits this season. New York can\u2019t afford another loss, with the Chiefs and Steelers also fighting for the AFC\u2019s two wild-card slots.\n\nTexans (7-7) at Titans (3-11), 11 a.m.\n\nIt\u2019s in your hands, Houston. Beat the Titans without Marcus Mariota, then Jacksonville in Week 17 to capture the AFC South title.\n\nBrowns (3-11) at Chiefs (9-5) , 11 a.m.\n\nKansas City\u2019s eight-game winning streak has put it in prime playoff position, while putting heat on Denver in the AFC West.\n\nColts (6-8) at Dolphins (5-9), 11 a.m.\n\nIndy\u2019s playoff hopes could end against Miami in a battle of two underachieving teams.\n\n49ers (4-10) at Lions (5-9), 11 a.m.\n\nSan Francisco is a double-digit underdog to a bad Detroit team. That\u2019s all you need to know about the 49ers\u2019 season.\n\nCowboys (4-10) at Bills (6-8), 11 a.m.\n\nThe quarterback conversation will be interesting come draft time, because Tony Romo can\u2019t stay healthy and Dallas can\u2019t win without him.\n\nBears (5-9) at Buccaneers (6-8), 11 a.m.\n\nThe Lovie Bowl, with Tampa Bay head coach Lovie Smith facing his former team. Both have shown flashes of success but lack the talent both sides of the ball to compete for a playoff berth.\n\nPanthers (14-0) at Falcons (7-7), 11 a.m.\n\nEarly in the season, this set up as a showdown. The teams met two weeks ago, with Carolina posting a 38-0 victory.\n\nSteelers (9-5) at Ravens (4-10), 11 a.m.\n\nThe Ravens could salvage some pride from a lost season and severely damage the Steelers\u2019 playoff chances.\n\nJaguars (5-9) at Saints (5-9), 2:05 p.m.\n\nAn offensive shootout is coming in New Orleans, as both teams rank in the league\u2019s bottom three for most points allowed.\n\nRams (6-8) at Seahawks (9-5), 2:25 p.m.\n\nSeattle can\u2019t win its division, but can get the better of the two wild-card spots.\n\nGiants (6-8) at Vikings (9-5), 6:30 p.m., KUSA-9\n\nNo Odell Beckham Jr. in a game New York needs to keep its playoff hopes alive. Minnesota locks up a playoff berth with a win.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Week 16 NFL Preview: Playoff implications in marquee games", "title": "Week 16 NFL Preview: Playoff implications in marquee games", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/12/26/week-16-nfl-preview-playoff-implications-in-marquee-games/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151226__e1fc60f1c79785398b0f6a7067004935p1.jpg", "height": 468}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151226__e1fc60f1c79785398b0f6a7067004935p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-26T16:36:36+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T23:21:08+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf0d6\"", "article_summary": "The quarterback conversation will be interesting come draft time, because Tony Romo can\u2019t stay healthy and Dallas can\u2019t win without him.\nColts (6-8) at Dolphins (5-9), 11 a.m.Indy\u2019s playoff hopes could end against Miami in a battle of two underachieving teams.\n49ers (4-10) at Lions (5-9), 11 a.m.San Francisco is a double-digit underdog to a bad Detroit team.\nBrowns (3-11) at Chiefs (9-5) , 11 a.m.Kansas City\u2019s eight-game winning streak has put it in prime playoff position, while putting heat on Denver in the AFC West.\nRams (6-8) at Seahawks (9-5), 2:25 p.m.Seattle can\u2019t win its division, but can get the better of the two wild-card spots."}
