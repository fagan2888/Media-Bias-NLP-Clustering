The Cougars (43-13) have put together an impressive resume of their own and are a lock to receive an NCAA at-large bid and could possibly host an NCAA Regional despite the loss.\n\nIt was the second consecutive one-run victory for the Seahawks over the Cougars in as many days. UNCW beat the Cougars, 4-3, on Friday to advance to Saturday\u2019s championship round.\n\nA year ago, it was the Cougars who beat William & Mary in the championship game and captured the CAA tournament, celebrating the victory at Brooks Field, home of the Seahawks.\n\nThis year, the Seahawks returned the favor.\n\nNot only was the image still on the minds of the UNC Wilmington players, but the Cougars swept the Seahawks in three games at Patriots Point two weeks ago.\n\n\u201cLast year they did the same thing to us,\u201d Scalf said. \u201cWhen we came down here two weeks ago, we didn\u2019t play our best baseball. But we knew if we could come in here and stay focused we\u2019d have an opportunity to win. I\u2019m so proud of the players. They did a great job all week and especially the last couple of days against one of the best baseball clubs in the country.\u201d\n\nThe Seahawks pounded the Cougars pitching for 26 hits in the two games this weekend. Dick led the way with five hits and drove in three runs in the two games. Every single starting position player got a hit against the Cougars on Saturday.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve got a tremendous ball club and we knew that coming in,\u201d said College of Charleston coach Monte Lee. \u201cThey really swung the bats well the last two games. You\u2019ve got to give them credit for the way they hit ball. They compete and play the game the right way. It was two really good college baseball games and we came up a little short both times. It\u2019s going to happen, but let\u2019s give Wilmington credit. They played great all tournament.\u201d\n\nThe Cougars advanced to the championship round with a 4-1 victory over Delaware. Redshirt freshman Hayden McCutcheon threw a complete game, giving up just six hits, and needed only 94 pitches.\n\n\u201cHayden came in and did exactly what we needed him to do,\u201d Lee said. \u201cHe pitched an outstanding game.\u201d\n\nThe only question for the Cougars that remains isn\u2019t if they\u2019ll make the field of 64 in the NCAA Tournament, it\u2019s if Saturday\u2019s loss hurt their chances of hosting a regional. The Cougars\u2019 RPI has been among the top-20 for the last two weeks.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll know until Sunday if this hurt us, I know it didn\u2019t help our case to host a regional,\u201d Lee said. \u201cWe\u2019ll just have to wait and see.\u201d\n\nUNCW came out swinging early as outfielders Steven Linkous and Casey Golden started the bottom of the first with back-to-back singles. Dick lined an RBI double to the gap in right-center and Luke Dunlap followed with a sacrifice fly to put the Seahawks ahead 2-0.\n\nThe Cougars cut the deficit in half in the second. Blake Butler drew a leadoff walk, stole second and scored on an RBI single to left by Erven Roper. In the top of the third, Brown doubled to left and a single by Alex Pastorius put runners on the corners. A Wise sacrifice fly plated Brown and Butler\u2019s single brought in Pastorius to give the Cougars a 3-2 advantage.\n\nThe Seahawks answered back in the bottom of the third. Stupienski was hit by a pitch, moved to second on a wild pitch, and scored when Zack Canada smashed a double off the wall in left. UNCW moved on top 4-3 as Canada came in from third on a grounder to second.\n\nThe Cougars drew even in the top of fourth when sophomore first baseman Nick Pappas opened the frame with his ninth homer of the season over the wall in right.\n\nUNCW regained the lead in the fifth. Terence Connelly drew a leadoff walk and Zach Shields reached on a bunt single. Kennard McDowell then faked a bunt and slapped the ball up the middle to bring in Connelly. A sacrifice fly by Linkous scored Shields for a 6-4 Seahawks advantage.\n\nBoth teams picked up a run in the seventh. For the Cougars, Champ Rowland led off with a single, advanced to third following a walk and a sacrifice, and scored on Wise\u2019s ground out. The Seahawks pushed their margin back to two when Dick\u2019s two-out double to the left-center gap plated Linkous.\n\nIn the eighth, back-to-back Seahawks fielding errors gave CofC runners on the corners with one out. The Cougars pulled within 7-6 when Bradley Jones scored on Devon Reed\u2019s fielder\u2019s choice, but Seahawks reliever Jared Gesell came on to limit any other damage.\n\n\u201cIt was a back-and-forth game all day,\u201d Lee said. \u201cThey\u2019d score and we\u2019d answer and we\u2019d score and they\u2019d come right back. It\u2019s what you\u2019d expect from two teams competing for a conference tournament championship.\u201d\n\nCofC threatened again in the ninth. Brown singled to right and moved into scoring position following a one-out wild pitch. But Gesell, who picked up the win, was able to induce a fly out and an infield pop-up to secure the title.\n\n\u201cThis hurts right now, but we\u2019ve got to forget about it because there are bigger goals out there,\u201d Wise said. \u201cWe can\u2019t let this bother us. As soon as we leave here we\u2019ve got to put this behind us and move on because we\u2019ve got a chance to play in a regional and make a run to Omaha.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "UNCW dumps Cougars, 7-6, wins CAA Tournament crown, Sports, \r\nSportsCollege, \r\nFP LatestNews, \r\nrsssports, \r\nrsssports, CAA baseball,CAA tournament,Carl Wise,College of Charleston baseball,Monte Lee,UNC Wilmington", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "If revenge is a dish best served cold, then the UNC Wilmington baseball team has been keeping this one at sub-zero temperatures for a while.", "title": "UNCW dumps Cougars, 7-6, wins CAA Tournament crown", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20150523/150529587/uncw-dumps-cougars-7-6-wins-caa-tournament-crown", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150523/PC20/150529587/AR/0/AR-150529587.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150523/PC20/150529587/AR/0/AR-150529587.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "If revenge is a dish best served cold, then the UNC Wilmington baseball team has been keeping this one at sub-zero temperatures for a while.", "title": "UNCW dumps Cougars, 7-6, wins CAA Tournament crown", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@hsprepzone", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150523/PC20/150529587/AR/0/AR-150529587.jpg?201505231912", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 150529587}}, "keywords": "UNCW dumps Cougars, 7-6, wins CAA Tournament crown , Sports, \r\nSportsCollege, \r\nFP LatestNews, \r\nrsssports, \r\nrsssports, CAA baseball,CAA tournament,Carl Wise,College of Charleston baseball,Monte Lee,UNC Wilmington", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-23T18:36:05Z", "modified_time": "2015-05-23T19:12:00Z", "author": "Andrew Miller"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "If revenge is a dish best served cold, then the UNC Wilmington baseball team has been keeping this one at sub-zero temperatures for a while."}, "article_summary": "It was the second consecutive one-run victory for the Seahawks over the Cougars in as many days.\nA year ago, it was the Cougars who beat William & Mary in the championship game and captured the CAA tournament, celebrating the victory at Brooks Field, home of the Seahawks.\nA Wise sacrifice fly plated Brown and Butler\u2019s single brought in Pastorius to give the Cougars a 3-2 advantage.\nUNCW beat the Cougars, 4-3, on Friday to advance to Saturday\u2019s championship round.\nBlake Butler drew a leadoff walk, stole second and scored on an RBI single to left by Erven Roper."}
