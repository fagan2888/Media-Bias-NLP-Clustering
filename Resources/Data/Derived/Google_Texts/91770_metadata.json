John Kerry John KerryGOP senator calls for China to crack down on illegal opioid Obamas to live in home of former Clinton press secretary: report Even in defeat, Trump could harm the country irreparably MORE (Mass.), met at Capitol Hill hot spot Charlie Palmer Steak with George W. Bush administration aide Bruce Mehlman.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn the heat of the Bush reelection campaign \u2014 four months before Election Day \u2014 Mehlman asked his rival to lunch.\n\n\u201cI believe it started with, \u2018This lunch isn\u2019t occurring and never occurred. But after the campaign, when your guy has lost, it would be fun to work together. What are you thinking about?\u2019 \u201d Mehlman recalled, sitting in the same restaurant more than a decade later.\n\n\u201cAnd the response was something along the lines of, \u2018Well, after my guy has won, I am thinking about returning to the industry, and it would be fun to have you work for me,\u2019 \u201d he added.\n\nEventually, after the dust from the campaign settled, a new lobby firm was born. Mehlman partnered with fellow Republican Alex Vogel, and Castagnetti made his membership public soon after.\n\nIt took six years for the upstart firm, then known as Mehlman Vogel Castagnetti, to grow into one of the top earners on K Street, but it\u2019s now consistently among those bringing in the most revenue.\n\nThe firm has a dozen lobbyists who work on blue-chip clients including Proctor & Gamble, Wal-Mart, Yahoo, United Technologies, the Business Roundtable, Edison Electric Institute, the National Restaurant Association, United Technologies, and the Technology CEO Council, where Mehlman serves as executive director.\n\nHewlett-Packard became one of the firm\u2019s first clients in January 2005, and Maria Cino, HP\u2019s vice president for Americas and U.S. government relations, called the lobby shop the company\u2019s \u201canchor firm.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re a one-stop shop for us. They\u2019re bipartisan, so they have strength on the Democratic and Republican side,\u201d she said. Currently, eight outside firms represent the company.\n\n\u201cWhile we meet with all our consultants twice a month, there\u2019s probably very few days that go by that one of HP\u2019s lobbyists aren\u2019t reaching out to Mehlman Castagnetti for a specific task,\u201d Cino said. \u201cThey\u2019re the go-to firm because of the depth of their experience, expertise and relationships.\u201d\n\nThe \u201clunch that never happened\u201d was so named because it wasn\u2019t supposed to happen. Still, the two had worked together on previous private sector projects and realized that they fit together quite well.\n\n\u201cBruce looks at things from a substantive perspective,\u201d Castagnetti says, \u201cI kind of bring a political perspective, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve kind of tried to integrate within the organization. Everyone has different talents.\u201d\n\nLast year, Vogel departed the firm to start his own non-lobbying venture, VogelHood Research. Mehlman and Castagnetti then rebranded the firm, adding the names of former Senate Republican leadership aide Dean Rosen, former Federal Trade Commission official David Thomas and former Democratic Senate aide Kelly Bingel, who had all been with the firm since its first years.\n\n\u201cIt felt very much like a Hill office, only from the business prism,\u201d Bingel recalls about her decision to join the firm in 2005, while working as the chief of staff to then-Sen. Blanche Lincoln (D-Ark.). \u201cWe\u2019ve been very successful in hiring people who share that ethos.\u201d\n\nWith a diverse client list, the firm has no policy specialties, so client work is a team effort, the partners say.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have a couple people who are substantive on an issue, and then when it\u2019s time to go to the floor for a fight, we can all come in,\u201d Bingel said.\n\nThe midsize firm has played a pivotal role in many legislative fights, including guiding corporate and government officials and lawmakers through the $57 billion merger between Gillette and Procter & Gamble, waging floor battles over the farm bill, and shepherding healthcare CEOs around the Capitol during late-night debates over the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cWe have dozens of priorities and you can\u2019t represent an industry like ours by being at the surface,\u201d said Mary Beth Donahue, executive vice president at America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, another longtime client.\n\nThe firm contains former high-level administration, Capitol Hill and campaign operatives, including former GOP Ways and Means Committee aide Sage Eastman, Democratic strategist CR Wooters and Republican operative Elise Pickering.\n\nThe firm\u2019s lobbyists excel at \u201cnot just getting us meetings and getting us speakers, but being able to go head-to-head on any policy issue,\u201d Donahue said, before adding, \u201cOur [policy] issues never end.\u201d\n\nIt also successfully represented United Technologies during the bitter battle with rival General Electric over a second engine for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, a program designed in the 1990s that fell out of favor with the Pentagon in 2006.\n\nNevertheless, congressional appropriators kept adding funds to the budget that continued the second engine\u2019s development and supported the manufacturing work of GE and Rolls Royce. That boiled over in an intense battle about the funds in 2010, and Congress killed the program the next year.\n\n\u201cYou learn that it\u2019s not about getting everybody to agree on the same conclusion, it\u2019s about bringing in many different-believing folks into a coalition if you can,\u201d Mehlman said of that fight.\n\n\u201cIf you can win a third of the votes you need because they\u2019re deficit hawks, great. If you can win a third of the votes because they\u2019re Defense Department believers \u2026 great, we\u2019ll take those too. Then there may be people who think it\u2019s good for their district or good for the environment; we\u2019ll take them also,\u201d he said. \u201cIt puts a huge premium on being bipartisan because those guys, whoever those guys are, are bipartisan.\u201d\n\nOver the last decade, K Street at large has also had to adapt to changes in the speed of media; changes in policy, including the ban of earmarks, which were a way to grease a deal; new ethics rules that have paved the way for \u201cshadow lobbyists,\u201d who do similar work but don\u2019t register; and escalating partisanship on Capitol Hill.\n\n\u201cJust because something fails the first time doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s going to fail a second or third time. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s going to happen today, tomorrow or six months from now,\u201d Castagnetti said. \u201cBut the important part is that you have to continue to work an issue so that you\u2019re ready for when the politics dictate that it\u2019s going to happen.\u201d\n\nBut lobbyists, especially Mehlman and Castagnetti, are nothing if not patient. They are already looking forward to pounding the pavement for another 10 years, at least.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not afraid to go up to the fifth floor of the Cannon building and make a sale,\u201d Castagnetti added.\n\nCannon is the oldest of the House office buildings. The fifth floor, considered to hold the least desirable office space, is nicknamed the \u201cfreshman dorm.\u201d\n\nCastagnetti added, \u201cI\u2019ve always said, I know it\u2019s time for me to get out of the business when I\u2019m afraid to walk up to the fifth floor of the Cannon building.\u201d\n\n-- This post was updated on June 3", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "In the aftermath of the 2004 presidential campaign, a new lobbying firm was born.", "description": "In the aftermath of the 2004 presidential campaign, a new lobbying firm was born.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Megan R.
