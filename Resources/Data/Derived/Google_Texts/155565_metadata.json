Nobody\u2019s making a living off that show. It\u2019s in need of some assistance in advertising it. We\u2019re not even allowed or given signage.\u201d\n\nThose participating in the show are used to rolling with controversial punches.\n\nThe show grew out of a small gathering in De la Guerra Plaza on Saturdays and Sundays, but was then moved by the city to the beachfront where three local artists began painting and displaying their work on weekends.\n\nWhen merchants started staying open on Saturdays, the show was slashed to just Sundays and Saturdays only on special holidays, Kennedy said.\n\nWhen hotels started moving to the waterfront on Cabrillo, such as The Fess Parker, the show was stopped where the hotel starts instead of spanning down to the public restrooms.\n\nAnd when Skater\u2019s Point was built in the 2000s, the show was cut again.\n\nKennedy, a UC Santa Barbara graduate who started showing in the crafts section in 1985, said the 18-month closure starting in February would displace 20 artists.\n\nThe Parks and Recreation Department has decided to move them to an area near a parking lot, a fate Kennedy says artists are resigned to, especially if the city would start pitching into an advertising fund.\n\nOne of the affected artists, a longtime member who didn\u2019t want to be named, said she hopes the city could give her and others a discounted fee.\n\n\u201cI love the camaraderie and feeling like it\u2019s my own little business,\u201d she said. \u201cBut everybody\u2019s complaining because I feel like we\u2019re a little taken for granted.\u201d\n\nSenior recreation supervisor Jason Bryan, who oversees the show, said the timing of the bridge project is unfortunate, since it will coincide with the show\u2019s 50th anniversary in 2015. He said he understands some artists want to divert more funds away from Visit Santa Barbara and other arts organizations.\n\nArtists air concerns and are very involved, Bryan said, noting quite a bit of city resources are used on the show that takes up a big swath of Chase Palm Park.\n\n\u201cThese are people who draw outside the lines by their creative nature,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re some passionate people.\u201d\n\nBryan said the $534 artists pay for a one-year permit is affordable, and about half of them use a payment plan that tacks on an additional small fee.\n\nFees include $20 that goes into an advertising fund, which Bryan said has about $10,000 \u2014 most earmarked for anniversary year festivities.\n\nHe agrees the show is a great face for Santa Barbara, displaying all handmade originals except for some photography and digital art reproductions.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of restrictions that go along with the show,\u201d Bryan said. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the charm that makes us so different from a lot of other opportunities. The show is constantly changing and evolving.\u201d\n\nKennedy, who now shows his photography across from the Santa Barbara FisHouse restaurant, said he remembers when fees were just $25 and hopes the number of artists doesn\u2019t continue to dwindle.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing like our show,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cIt really puts a stamp of the art community on Santa Barbara. We have a whole group of people who work very, very hard all the time in order to be able to display their best work. Yet those in power in the city do absolutely nothing to show their appreciation for the attraction we all provide.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Noozhawk staff writer Gina Potthoff can be reached at .(JavaScript must be enabled to view this email address) .
