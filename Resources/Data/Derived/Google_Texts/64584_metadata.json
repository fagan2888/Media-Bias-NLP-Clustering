HHS officials announced last night that the government will pay insurers $362 million from the program for 2014 \u2014 or 12 percent of the $2.9 billion they sought. Under the law, the government is required to eventually make the full requested payments. But as Pro\u2019s Paul Demko notes the \u201chuge shortfall raises questions about where the funds for the program will come from and whether some insurers will encounter cash-flow problems.\u201d More from Paul here.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nICD-10: SO FAR, SO GOOD \u2014 It turns out that the world didn\u2019t end on day one of the ICD-10 transition (which you'll no doubt remember falls on the second anniversary of the HealthCare.gov fiasco.) In fact, according to CMS, ICD-10's start went ok. CMS\u2019s Lauren Shaham told our eHealth team that \u201cCMS and Medicare fee-for-service claims processing systems are reporting business as usual with no reports of unusual activity at this time.\u201d She added that the ICD-10 Coordination Center is continuing \u201cto monitor for any provider issues across the country and will address concerns as they arise.\u201d If you haven\u2019t had a chance to poke around the nearly 70,000 ICD-10 codes, check out Healthcare Dive\u2019s roundup of some of the more amusing entries: http://bit.ly/1r3Z0IV\n\nANOTHER MASS-SHOOTING, ANOTHER CALL FOR MENTAL HEALTH REFORM \u2014As the news filtered in of the mass shooting at an Oregon community college, Rep. Tim Murphy, who has been pushing for an overhaul to the mental health system since the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School, urged congressional leaders to take up his bill \u2014 the Helping Families In Mental Health Crisis Act, which he reintroduced earlier this year. \u201cIn moments like this, leaders take action - and there have been far too many moments like this since Newtown. Put up a vote on my bill and we\u2019ll see who is serious about crisis mental health reform,\u201d Murphy told PULSE. \u2026 The House Energy and Commerce Committee is expected to consider Murphy\u2019s bill later this year. Meanwhile, the Senate HELP Committee could mark up a similar measure, sponsored by Sens. Chris Murphy and Bill Cassidy this month.\n\nADVOCATES URGE CONGRESS TO PASS REFORM BILL NOW \u2014 Before news of the shooting surfaced, more than 20 advocacy groups wrote E&C Chairman Fred Upton and ranking member Rep. Frank Pallone on Thursday calling for action on Rep. Murphy\u2019s legislation. \"The Congress and your Committee regularly act to ensure that Americans with heart disease, cancer or any other medical illness have access to care. The same should be true for those with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and other serious mental illness,\u201d the groups write. The letter is the latest push from advocates who see this year as the best chance yet to pass reform. The letter here.\n\n\u2026 Advocates have been making a big push on the Hill this week \u2014 members from the National Council, Mental Health America and National Alliance on Mental Illness, among others met with Upton, Pallone, both Sen. Murphy and Rep. Murphy, and other lawmakers who have been advocating for mental health reform. The groups have a \u201cfly in\u201d day scheduled for Tuesday with advocates from across the country on the Hill pushing for action.\n\nHAPPY FRIDAY MORNING and welcome to PULSE, where we are ready to bunker down and brace for whatever portion of Hurricane Joaquin hits us \u2026 and all of the groan-worthy Joaquin Phoenix jokes that come with it.

The House-approved measure passed on a voice vote and now heads to the president\u2019s desk. Under the ACA, the small group market was slated to expand to businesses with up to 100 employees \u2014 compared to the current threshold of 50 workers. Opponents of that provision argued that the change would cause disruption in the market and force mid-sized businesses to seek out new coverage. This bill allows states to decide whether or not to expand the small group market\n\nBIG RATE HIKES FOR MINNESOTA? YOU BETCHA \u2014 The state that claimed the lowest Obamacare premiums in the country two years ago is getting slapped with steep rate hikes in 2016. Premium increases for individual plans will range from an average of 14.2 percent to 49 percent, Pro\u2019s Paul Demko reports. Six of the eight plans competing for customers will increase rates by more than 25 percent. That's for plans sold both on and off the state\u2019s Obamacare exchange. Paul\u2019s got more for here.\n\nUTAH\u2019S GOV. HEDGES ON MEDICAID SPECIAL SESSION \u2014 Gov. Gary Herbert says he still hopes to call a special session \u201cprobably the latter part of October\u201d for the Utah legislature to again consider Medicaid expansion, but he wouldn\u2019t say definitively that he was going to. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019ve been pointing towards, and the question will be whether [the legislature] can get it passed,\u201d he said in an interview in Washington on Thursday, two days after lawmakers were briefed on the state\u2019s new expansion plan. The level of support \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 may be more apparent next week, when a legislative task force considers the proposal during an Oct. 6 meeting. Opposition is strongest in the Utah House, which earlier this year shot down Herbert\u2019s previous proposal.\n\n** A message from American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network: Palliative care is about treating the patient as well as the disease. It\u2019s a big shift in focus for health care delivery \u2014 and it works.

CMS earlier this year proposed cuts of 10 to 20 percent for those rates, according to the Digestive Health Physicians Association, which encouraged the letters. Colorectal cancer is a big problem for Medicare beneficiaries especially, the lawmakers write \u2014 and while rates are improving thanks to increased prevention and detection efforts, the proposal could \"jeopardize recent progress and a budding public health success story.\" The letters are here: http://bit.ly/1OaTGRb and here:http://bit.ly/1OaTEsp.\n\nGAO: VALUE-BASED PURCHASING HARDER ON SAFETY NETS \u2014 A new GAO report confirms what many in the health care world have been saying for a while: safety net hospitals are getting hurt by value-based purchasing programs. They got smaller bonuses or larger penalties than hospitals overall, the report says, although the gap narrowed over time. Small urban hospitals, in contrast, did better than hospitals overall.\n\n\u2014 GAO didn't see any noticeable shift in hospital performance on quality measures \u2014 but it says that could change as new measures are added and weighted differently. One exception: hospitals did improve on readmissions, which GAO said signals financial penalties might, \"under certain circumstances,\" promote enhanced quality. Hospitals told GAO that the Hospital Value Based Purchasing Program reinforced their ongoing quality improvement efforts, but didn't really change their focus. The most commonly cited barrier to improving quality? Challenges with IT systems.

The group includes vaccine makers, public health organizations and health care providers who want to raise awareness that, for instance, less than 40 percent of adults get the flu vaccine and only about 20 percent of adults over 60 get the shingles vaccine. An estimated 50,000 adults die of vaccine-preventable diseases each year, according to the AVAC.

It changes a person\u2019s life, and the lives of everyone close to them. Palliative care sees the person beyond the cancer treatment. It gives the patient control. It brings trained specialists together with doctors and nurses in a team-based approach to improve quality of life during serious illness, explain treatment options, and manage symptoms like pain, nausea, and fatigue. It\u2019s a big shift in focus for health care delivery \u2014 and it works. The evidence is clear that including palliative care with disease-directed treatment improves quality, reduces costs, and may even increase survival. The American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network (ACS CAN) is calling on Members of Congress to support palliative care legislation (H.R. 3119) to help reduce suffering and improve the quality of life of the millions of families facing serious illnesses.

That means a long trip or higher copays to stick with the pharmacies that patients like. In urban areas, these plans often fail to meet the government\u2019s standard for pharmacy access. In rural areas, \u201cpreferred\u201d pharmacies are often 20+ miles away! Support H.R. 793 / S. 1190. This bipartisan legislation is supported by leading consumer advocates and would let patients use any pharmacy willing to accept the \u201cpreferred\u201d pharmacy terms and conditions.
