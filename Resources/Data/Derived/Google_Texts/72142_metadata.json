Ricardo Lara (D-Bell Gardens), would require doctors to check CURES before prescribing controlled substances for the first time to a patient in California, and annually if the course of narcotic treatment continues. The state Senate passed the bill, but it has stalled in the Assembly.\n\nCMA, a trade group representing about 40,000 physicians in the state, opposes the bill, saying it \u201cwould create an unnecessary regulatory burden to prescribing and increase the threat of litigation, both of which would have a detrimental impact on patient care.\u201d\n\nCMA officials added another reason to oppose the bill last month when a new version of the electronic system \u2014 CURES 2.0 \u2014 was rolled out. The new version\u2019s reliance on the use of up-to-date Web browsers posed a problem for some physicians and physician groups, according to the CMA.\n\n\u201cWe support the CURES database, but it needs to be workable before we start mandating the use of it,\u201d said Molly Weedn, associate vice president of public affairs for CMA.\n\nCMA Resistance Called \u2018Troubling\u2019\n\nCarmen Balber, executive director of Consumer Watchdog, said California policymakers should recognize and join the national trend toward mandatory use of prescription databases.\n\n\u201cMore and more states across country are moving in this direction and we\u2019re seeing more and more authorities saying it\u2019s part of the answer to stemming the epidemic of drug abuse,\u201d Balber said.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t just patient or consumer advocates saying this. CDC is strongly pushing in that direction and the American Medical Association has announced a task force to explore the issue,\u201d Balber said.\n\nBalber said the CMA\u2019s opposition to Lara\u2019s bill is ill advised.\n\n\u201cI find it really troubling that the [California] medical association continues to throw out scare tactics to doctors instead of embracing change that could save lives,\u201d Balber said.\n\nBefore CURES 2.0 launched, CMA officials warned physicians about potential connectivity problems, saying that if the California Department of Justice did not change its implementation plan, \u201ca minimum of thousands of physicians will lose access to CURES.\u201d\n\nDOJ modified its plans and called for a \u201csoft\u201d launch, allowing physicians with older browsers to retain access to the older version of the system.\n\nKentucky Database Triggered Decline in Drug Abuse\n\nResearch from the University of Kentucky Institute for Pharmaceutical Outcomes and Policy shows a decline in the number of prescriptions for commonly abused medications, a reduction in \u201cdoctor shopping\u201d and an increase in the number of Kentuckians seeking treatment for prescription medication addiction.\n\nThe research specifically measured the effect of a law enacted in 2012. Among other things, the new law required all physicians and pharmacists to register with and use the state\u2019s recently upgraded electronic system for monitoring prescription drugs. The Kentucky All Schedule Prescription Electronic Reporting, or KASPER, system is similar in scope and intent to CURES.\n\nAccording to the study, the number of patients in Kentucky who \u201cshop around\u201d for doctors to obtain prescriptions declined by 52 percent, opioid prescriptions to doctor-shopping individuals dropped by 54 percent and overdose-related deaths declined in 2013 \u2014 the first drop in such deaths in six years.\n\nOther states have reported similar results. Earlier this year in a report to the Tennessee General Assembly:\n\n41 percent of prescribers in Tennessee reported they are less likely to prescribe controlled substances after checking a prescription database;\n\n34 percent said they were more likely to refer a patient for substance abuse treatment; and\n\n86 percent of prescribers believe the database is useful for decreasing doctor shopping.\n\n\u201cThe study from Kentucky is consistent with the results in every other state that has mandatory use of the electronic system,\u201d Balber said.\n\nBalber discounted the argument that physicians will use the system without being forced to.\n\n\u201cThere are some states that have mandates only in name \u2014 saying physicians should check the database \u2018if they think they need to.\u2019 But research has shown that only the truly mandatory requirements have any effect,\u201d Balber said.\n\nThe CURES system, used to monitor Schedule II and Schedule III drugs \u2014 such as OxyContin and other opioids \u2014 \u201cis seldom used in California because checking is voluntary, and that lack of use is costing lives,\u201d Balber said.\n\nAlthough CMA officials said they support the use of CURES 2.0, they said they wouldn\u2019t necessarily support mandatory use \u2014 or Lara\u2019s bill \u2014 even if the system is working at 100 percent.\n\n\u201cI think the most important thing is that we don\u2019t know what other problems might arise,\u201d Weedn said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know until a few days before the rollout that there would be an issue (with browser connectivity) for example,\u201d Weedn said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Study shows similar database in Kentucky has reduced prescription drug abuse, but CMA opposes mandate here.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Should California Doctors Be Required to Use Drug Monitoring Database?\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2015\\/08\\/13\\/should-california-doctors-be-required-to-use-drug-monitoring-database\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-08-13 10:40:58\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-08-13 11:26:25\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":61221,\"author_id\":\"80\",\"author_name\":\"Jon Brooks\",\"author_display_name\":\"Jon Brooks\",\"tags\":[],\"categories\":[\"Policy\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2013\\/01\\/Pills.Credit_Grumpy-Puddin2.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "Study shows similar database in Kentucky has reduced prescription drug abuse, but CMA opposes mandate here.", "title": "Should California Doctors Be Required to Use Drug Monitoring Database?", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2015/08/13/should-california-doctors-be-required-to-use-drug-monitoring-database/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2013/01/Pills.Credit_Grumpy-Puddin2.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf210\"", "article_summary": "Study shows similar database in Kentucky has reduced prescription drug abuse, but CMA opposes mandate here.\nAmong other things, the new law required all physicians and pharmacists to register with and use the state\u2019s recently upgraded electronic system for monitoring prescription drugs.\n\u201cThe study from Kentucky is consistent with the results in every other state that has mandatory use of the electronic system,\u201d Balber said.\n\u201cWe support the CURES database, but it needs to be workable before we start mandating the use of it,\u201d said Molly Weedn, associate vice president of public affairs for CMA.\nA bill calling for such a mandate stalled in the California Legislature this year after encountering opposition from the California Medical Association."}
