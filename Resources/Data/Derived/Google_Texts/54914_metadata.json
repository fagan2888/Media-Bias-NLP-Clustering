Some suggested legislation was needed to prevent that from happening.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut the top two members of the House Intelligence Committee said this week they have not made any decisions about endorsing a bill that could lead to the de facto regulation of encryption standards.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be an ongoing issue,\u201d Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) told The Hill. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at all the bills.\u201d\n\nRep. Adam Schiff Adam SchiffClinton\u2019s email troubles deepen House passes policy bill for intelligence agencies Sunday shows preview: Sanders opens up about battle with Clinton MORE, the committee\u2019s top Democrat, was more direct.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re any closer to a consensus on that than we were, I think, six months ago,\u201d he said Tuesday at a Christian Science Monitor breakfast. \u201cOr if there is a consensus, it is that a legislative solution, I think, is very unlikely.\u201d\n\nNumerous other congressional leaders have echoed that caution, making it increasingly doubtful that Congress will move quickly on an encryption bill.\n\n\u201cI think this is starting to look like more of a slow-burning, let\u2019s learn the facts and proceed with caution sort of issue,\u201d said Josh Withrow, legislative affairs manager at FreedomWorks, a libertarian-leaning advocacy group that opposes encryption legislation.\n\nLaw enforcement officials argue criminals and terrorists are increasingly using unbreakable encryption to communicate and hide plans from investigators, a phenomenon they call \u201cgoing dark.\u201d\n\nNunes said his committee has been briefed on numerous examples of this trend.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not a week that goes by that we don\u2019t meet with some foreign country, an ally, that comes in with concerns about the encryption issues as it becomes harder and harder for law enforcement to do investigations,\u201d he said.\n\nBut major tech firms such as Apple have stood behind strong encryption, arguing they can\u2019t comply with court orders seeking secured data because even they can\u2019t crack into their products.\n\nTech companies insist that having any method to access encrypted data puts all secure information at risk. Keeping a key around to unlock encryption means that anyone, including hackers, can use that key, they argue.\n\nWeakening encryption could imperil everyday digital activities like online banking and endanger people's privacy online, technologists caution.\n\nThe divergence of views has created a stalemate.\n\nSome lawmakers think legislation could help, but they have not been able to coalesce around one approach.\n\nSens. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) and Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) \u2014 the Senate Intelligence counterparts to Nunes and Schiff \u2014 are working on a bill that would force companies to comply with court orders seeking encrypted data.\n\nBut their measure has not received much support from other key senators with jurisdiction over cybersecurity.\n\nSen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), who chairs the Senate Homeland Security Committee, expressed doubts about the approach last week.\n\n\u201cIs it really going to solve any problems if we force our companies to do something here in the U.S.?\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just going to move offshore. Determined actors, terrorists, are still going to be able to find a service provider that will be able to encrypt accounts.\u201d\n\nSchiff echoed Johnson\u2019s concerns.\n\n\u201cThe question that for me that may trump all others is, \u2018Does it work to develop a key in a global environment if there\u2019s not global consensus?\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure that that argument can be overcome.\u201d\n\nJohnson\u2019s lower chamber counterpart \u2014 House Homeland Security Chairman Michael McCaul (R-Texas) \u2014 has also spoken in opposition of the Burr-Feinstein bill, calling the concept \u201cproblematic.\u201d\n\nMcCaul (R-Texas) is set to introduce his own competing legislation with Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) \u2014 who sits on the Intelligence Committee \u2014 that would form a national commission to investigate encryption.\n\nThe commission would include tech industry leaders, privacy advocates, academics, law enforcement officials and members of the intelligence community. It would be tasked with providing recommendations on how police could get at encrypted data without endangering Americans\u2019 privacy.\n\nThose recommendations would likely involve a host of technological options, McCaul said, but could include legislative proposals as well.\n\nNunes didn't endorse either approach, but called the issue \"an ongoing problem, not only here, but globally.\"\n\nSchiff called the commission proposal \"fine, but it may be a bit redundant.\" But he believes the Burr-Feinstein effort is especially futile.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think a legislative solution is feasible or at this point desirable,\u201d he said, recalling last year\u2019s contentious fight over surveillance reform that resulted in the USA Freedom Act, a bill that rolled back some of the more controversial government spying tactics.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine, given the difficulty we had moving forward on the USA Freedom Act, that we could legislatively accomplish something where [we\u2019re] this far from consensus on the encryption issue,\u201d Schiff said.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re any closer to a consensus,\" Rep.
