Confirming your enrollment in the insurance plan may not be immediate, because companies are facing thousands of last minute applications. During the open enrollment period, many insurance companies can confirm acceptance of your enrollment the same day.\n\n\u201cIn past years, it has actually taken weeks before some insurers were able to confirm enrollments for new customers,\u201d said Nate Purpura, vice president of consumer affairs at eHealth.com, an online health insurance exchange based in Mountain View, Calif. \u201cAs you can imagine, this can cause serious confusion and frustration.\u201d\n\nThe deadline day crush always brings out the procrastinators and a \u201cshocking number\u201d of people wait until the very last day of open enrollment to sign up, he said. This surge in enrollments has only overwhelmed government websites and officials have made allowances in the past, but \u201cyou can\u2019t count on it,\u201d Purpura said.\n\n\u201cPrivate online marketplaces like eHealth may be a better bet and there are offline means of enrolling for some consumers,\u201d he said.\n\nCoverage Begins March 1\n\nThe earliest your coverage can begin is March 1, which is simply business as usual, said Purpura. The coverage for insurance applications received before the 15th day of any given month will generally start on the 1st of the next month. This mean that coverage for applications received later than the 15th of any given month usually begin on the 1st of the month after next.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the way health insurance works, and it typically takes between two to six weeks for coverage under any new plan to start,\u201d he said.\n\nWhere Is Your Payment?\n\nSimply signing up for a plan means your coverage could face even more delays. Health care coverage does not actually start until you pay for it, so if you failed to include a means of payment for the first month of coverage such as a credit card, your coverage could be delayed.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s not received in a timely manner, it\u2019s possible that your enrollment may be discarded,\u201d Purpura said. \u201cThe timeframes required for initial payment can vary by insurer. Your health insurance coverage will not be in effect before your payment is received.\u201d\n\nDelays with receiving your ID card from your insurance company should also be expected, because they may not be able mail out the new cards immediately. If it is getting close to March 1 and you still do not have your ID card, call the insurance company who can give you the membership number or other information such as the group number to give your health care provider. Another option is to create an account from the insurance company's website and obtain a temporary ID card which you can download and print.\n\nIf you are facing an emergency and must see a doctor before you even get your ID, just save the bill and then file a claim later once you receive it, said Jack Hooper, CEO of Take Command Health, an online health insurance exchange based in Dallas. It\u2019s an extra headache, but as long as your plan is approved, you\u2019ll be able to work everything out,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile insurance companies often take the brunt of the complaints, many consumers, even ones in the healthcare industry drag their feet, and sign up only when they are faced with a looming deadline or need to see a physician.\n\nOne woman who is a nurse called Hooper on December 24 and said she needed to purchase insurance for her elective hip surgery on January 4. Not only did she miss the December 15 deadline for coverage to start on Jan. 1, but she was aware of this surgery for several months, Hooper said.\n\n\u201cOur second worst client this year was a doctor who tried to sign his family up for insurance on December 30 for a January 1 start date,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just goes to show that sometimes health professionals don\u2019t even know how to handle health insurance.\u201d\n\nEven insurance companies can lose data and one company lost 48 applications this year, Hooper said.\n\n\u201cThankfully, we had records and were able to get it resolved, but if they lost 48 of ours, there\u2019s no telling how many others they lost,\u201d he said. \u201cLuckily, we were able to catch it and get it fixed.\u201d\n\n", "article_metadata": {"layout": "main", "description": "Consumers who waited until the eleventh hour to purchase health insurance might run into some delays and snags, but many of the complications will work themselves out.", "author": "Ellen Chang", "og": {"site_name": "MainStreet", "description": "Consumers who waited until the eleventh hour to purchase health insurance might run into some delays and snags, but many of the complications will work themselves out.", "title": "Buying Last Minute Health Insurance Will Mean Waiting Until March 1 for Coverage", "url": "https://www.mainstreet.com/article/buying-last-minute-health-insurance-will-mean-waiting-until-march-1-for-coverage", "image": {"width": 600, "secure_url": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/exorbitant-medical-bill.jpg", "identifier": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/exorbitant-medical-bill.jpg", "height": 400}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "section": "Insurance", "keywords": "deductible, premium, Obamacare, ACA, tax penalty, co-pay, in network, ER", "fb": {"app_id": 925400040808836}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MainStreet", "section": "Insurance", "tag": "ER", "published_time": "2016-02-02T15:51Z", "author": "https://www.mainstreet.com/author/1611359"}, "date": "2016-02-02T15:51Z", "contentType": "article", "guid": 13443178, "twitter": {"description": "Consumers who waited until the eleventh hour to purchase health insurance might run into some delays and snags, but many of the complications will work themselves out.", "title": "Buying Last Minute Health Insurance Will Mean Waiting Until March 1 for Coverage", "url": "https://www.mainstreet.com/article/buying-last-minute-health-insurance-will-mean-waiting-until-march-1-for-coverage", "image": {"src": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/exorbitant-medical-bill.jpg", "identifier": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/exorbitant-medical-bill.jpg"}, "site": "@mainstr", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "deductible, premium, Obamacare, ACA, tax penalty, co-pay, in network, ER"}, "article_summary": "Confirming your enrollment in the insurance plan may not be immediate, because companies are facing thousands of last minute applications.\nADVERTISEMENTConsumers who waited until the eleventh hour to purchase health insurance might run into some delays and snags, but many of the complications will work themselves out.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the way health insurance works, and it typically takes between two to six weeks for coverage under any new plan to start,\u201d he said.\nCoverage Begins March 1The earliest your coverage can begin is March 1, which is simply business as usual, said Purpura.\nThe coverage for insurance applications received before the 15th day of any given month will generally start on the 1st of the next month."}
