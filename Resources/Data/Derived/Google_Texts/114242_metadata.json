The college terminus has been part of the western LRT project.\n\nCentrepointe is home to two major city facilities, Ben Franklin Place and the administrative Mary Pitt Centre.\n\nThe ward also includes Bells Corners, which has been on an upward swing in generating more economic activity. The rehabilitation of the business strip is a work-in-progress.\n\nCandidate: Guy Annable\n\nWhy are you running?\n\n\"I want to replace a lifelong councillor who stated \"he did not bother to read\" the 131-page $140-million Orgaworld contract and \"he trusted his colleagues on the environment committee\" on the 80,000 put-or-pay tonnage while accepting considerable campaign contributions in the 2006 election from the exact companies that benefited from that contract. I will let readers decide whether they feel that is incompetent or unethical or a combination of the two.\"\n\nWhat is the biggest issue facing the ward?\n\n\"Weekly garbage pickup, affordable student housing in close proximity to Algonquin College, the revitalization of Bells Corners retail strip on Robertson Rd.\"\n\nAre you accepting developer and/or union donations for your campaign?\n\n\"No, it is a key plank in my platform. Like Toronto, I feel we should ban all donations from corporations and unions, the optics are as bad as the practice. I find it very hypocritical that a $15 hockey ticket receives scrutiny under the ethics commissioner rules outside the election period, but during the election period, unnamed fundraisers allow candidates to literally launder money without declaring where it came from.\"\n\nWho do you consider a role model as a great leader?\n\n\"Theodore Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, and of course the Iron Lady, Margaret Thatcher\"\n\nWhat's your main vice?\n\n\"Tobacco. I will quit, I must, but I only smoke one pack a week. To be totally honest, it is a disgusting habit.\"\n\nCandidate: Rick Chiarelli (incumbent)\n\nWhy are you running?\n\nWith an unprecedented number of councillors not seeking re-election this time, the city needs experience. I am one of the most experienced members of council. I have proven that I understand the complexities of municipal government, what is actually possible and how to make it happen. I want to use my experience to hold the line on taxes. We can succeed if we change council budget rules to create a more open public debate on debt and introduce more of the pay-as-you-go strategies that made the former Nepean debt-free with the lowest average tax increases in the region. Our budget rules should be a rumble strip against higher taxes but they should not be a solid barrier against more extensive debate and priority setting.\n\nWhat is the biggest issue facing the ward?\n\nIllegal rooming house conversions and the noise and property standards violations that accompany them. Residents do not want College ward to become the next Sandy Hill. In Bel Air, City View, Ryan Farm, Crestview and Centrepointe, that is the issue that has galvanized the largest number of residents to attend public meetings, write, phone and message me. Algonquin College's enrolment has doubled in the last number of years. That has put strain on the market for small, affordable rental housing. I have visited many of the other Ontario municipalities that have been coping with similar challenges. Their message to us is clear: Act now before the problem explodes. And that is what we have done. For over six years I have worked with community groups and used my experience to develop solutions. We achieved changes to the rooming house bylaw that prohibited physical conversions of single family homes into mini-apartments. We supported changes to the city's noise bylaw that enabled law enforcement to charge tenants hosting wild parties etc. without having to identify which specific individual made the noise. Most recently I have used my experience to assist two newer members of council in tackling conversion concerns in their wards and they have supported my communities' efforts to get City Hall to explore new rules to enable access to rental units to ensure safety and to determine whether suspect buildings are, in fact, illegal rooming houses. City council agreed and staff have now been directed to assess the tools adopted by other municipalities. I want to ensure that we remain strong in protecting the property rights of home owners who have invested hundreds of thousands of dollars in their homes and in protecting the character of their communities while, at the same time, ensuring safe and reasonable room rental accommodation for students and others around the college.\n\nAre you accepting developer and/or union donations for your campaign?\n\nI thank all of the individuals and local businesses who believe in what I am doing and have supported my campaign to this point and in the coming weeks. I believe that, in a democracy, this is a very important way that everyone can participate. The City Of Ottawa does not have the power to limit contributions from unions or corporations. The province sets the rules and yes, I follow the rules religiously. The province sets the rules to provide the most transparency. When a business donates to a campaign, the name of the business is public. If we went to a system where companies could not donate as a corporation, then the owners and employees of the companies would just donate -- only very few residents would associate those names with the companies and the particular interest of the companies would not be as obvious. The provincial government sets the rules and those rules apply across the province (except in Toronto where provincial law has granted them special status and powers not available to the other municipalities). Reality: Campaigns are expensive. It costs a significant amount of money even to get a letter to each voter and to interact and respond to residents. Those costs have to be financed. We could say, ok, nobody should accept any donations from anybody, candidates should pay all the costs themselves, only the rich can run -- but that wouldn't be democratic and it would hardly reduce influence of the wealthy. So the province has to balance the need to finance campaigns while making it possible for ordinary residents to run -- against undue influence. They do so by establishing contribution limits. I am happy the contribution limit they have set is lower than applies in most other jurisdictions so there is no reasonable possibility of undue influence.\n\nWho do you consider a role model as a great leader?\n\nBen Franklin. With so few experienced members seeking re-election this time, experience is important for our ward, but it is also very much needed at council. There is no better experience than being a young councillor, as I was in the 1990s, working under Ben Franklin. Ben taught me to be a staunch defender of the pay-as-you-go system of finance that made Nepean debt-free, with the highest level of service. He understood the role the City could play in developing our local economy and the basic importance of an excellent transit system.\n\nWhat's your main vice?\n\nRob Snow's show on CFRA.\n\nCandidate: Craig MacAulay\n\nWhy are you running?\n\nRick has 25 years of experience as a slick career politician but his recent costly blunders and lame excuses have made a lot of voters angry. It's time someone belled the cat! If you want all the gory details you'll have to go to my blog bellscorners.wordpress.com.\n\nWhat is the biggest issue facing the ward?\n\nThe need for democratic reform -- we'll never realize our potential as a city without fair elections, honest politicians and an end to corruption. Fair elections: 1) Politicians should not be allowed to finance their campaigns with cash from corporations, unions and special interests 2) Politicians should not campaign or reward their friends with taxpayer funds 3) A small simple change that would make Ottawa's elections fair and friendly -- ranked choice voting.\n\nAre you accepting developer and/or union donations for your campaign?\n\nI'm not accepting or spending a penny on my campaign. I don't think that you should be able to spend your way to power with dirty money. The irony is that incumbents already have such a huge advantage at election time that they don't even need to take the brown envelopes, so it must be greed or arrogance.\n\nWho do you consider a role model as a great leader?\n\nThere are many politicians whom I admire, if that's what you mean. But none of them are perfect, for with power comes temptation, which is why there must be transparency, accountability and, as much as possible, decision-making should be decentralized to the community level where everyone gets a chance to provide real input, not just special interests.\n\nWhat's your main vice?\n\nI know that my shtick irritates and even infuriates a lot of people (especially the vested interests that I politely criticize on my \"satirical\" blog). But sometimes you have to call a spade a spade for the greater community good. I'll be the first to admit that I have many faults, but look at my three zero-means-zero-means-zero promises on my Bells Corners blog bellscorners.wordpress.com and decide for yourself if I'm really as nasty as Team Rick says.\n\nCandidate: Scott Andrew McLarens\n\nWhy are you running?\n\nI'm running because I want to have a positive effect on the city which I love. Moreover, I feel I'm at the perfect age to do so. I'm young and driven, but with the experience of hard work and dedication behind me. I think that now is my time to jump in with both feet and dedicate my hard work to making this city the best it can be.\n\nWhat is the biggest issue facing the ward?\n\nI think our biggest current issue, if you ask the people with whom I've chatted whilst going door to door, would be our waste management issues. The Orgaworld fiasco has disheartened many of them, and hearing our current city council try and shift blame off of themselves has offended them. However, as someone who spent the previous few years in a daily commute to Carleton University I am also heavily focused on improving the ward's public transit issues.\n\nAre you accepting developer and/or union donations for your campaign?\n\nThe only donations I am accepting come from individuals who believe in me and are willing to help me succeed in whatever way they can. No developers or unions will be donating to my campaign.\n\nWho do you consider a role model as a great leader?\n\nWhile I'd not consider him a political role model, I've always been fascinated by the fortitude of Winston Churchill. His speeches about being strong and true during one of the world's biggest crises are exemplary of hard work and determination, two traits which I believe every politician should display.\n\nWhat's your main vice?\n\nMy greatest vice would have to be video games. I do love to spend my free time playing FIFA (when I can't be out on the soccer field myself). And while I know it is argued that there are far more productive hobbies, I just can't help myself. The chance to pretend, even for a moment that I am one of the world's best athletes, or saving it from aliens (making it a better place) is a hard one to pass up.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Ottawa Sun", "description": "The largest ward by population, the city \r\nestimated that 53,300 people lived in \r\nCollege at the end of 2012.", "title": "Residents hot over rooming houses in College Ward", "url": "http://www.ottawasun.com/2014/10/05/residents-hot-over-rooming-houses-in-college-ward?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=recommend-button&utm_campaign=Residents hot over rooming houses in College Ward", "image": "http://storage.ottawasun.com/v1/suns-prod-images/1297614638942_LARGE_BOX.jpg?quality=80&stmp=1464243457606", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 162622253780945}, "description": "The largest ward by population, the city \r\nestimated that 53,300 people lived in \r\nCollege at the end of 2012.", "robots": "NOODP,NOYDIR"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbc71\"", "article_summary": "The college presents a unique residential environment with rooming houses full of transient students living in neighbourhoods with established homeowners.\nCity council agreed and staff have now been directed to assess the tools adopted by other municipalities.\nWhat is the biggest issue facing the ward?\nThe Orgaworld fiasco has disheartened many of them, and hearing our current city council try and shift blame off of themselves has offended them.\nThe largest ward by population, the city estimated that 53,300 people lived in College at the end of 2012."}
