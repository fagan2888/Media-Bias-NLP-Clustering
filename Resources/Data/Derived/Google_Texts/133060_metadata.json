These include a pair of Russian Su-24 fighter jets that buzzed within 30 feet of the USS Donald Cook in the Baltic Sea on April 11 and 12, and a Su-27 fighter jet that performed a barrel roll within 50 feet of a U.S. RC-135 spy plane April 14.\n\n\u201cThese kinds of planned maneuvers are especially dangerous because they bring us very close to an unplanned accident,\u201d a former Soviet fighter pilot told The Daily Signal.\n\nThe U.S. and NATO say Russia has demonstrated a pattern of military aggression and reckless brinksmanship across Eastern Europe that risks sparking a military conflict.\n\nRussia says NATO\u2019s military buildup on the alliance\u2019s eastern frontier is a threat to Russian national security.\n\n\u201cIt was definitely done on purpose, and with the NATO summit in mind,\u201d Oleksiy Melnyk, a former Ukrainian air force lieutenant colonel who served as a fighter pilot in the Soviet air force, said of the aerial antics by the Russian jets in an interview with The Daily Signal.\n\n\u201cHaving the same background, I\u2019m sure the pilots were not too young and too stupid to realize that these kinds of maneuvers would create an international scandal,\u201d said Melnyk, now co-director of foreign relations and international security programs at the Razumkov Centre, a Ukrainian think tank.\n\nBeginning in 1986, Melnyk flew Mig-21s for the USSR. He said the intent of the recent Russian intercepts was likely twofold: To send a diplomatic message to NATO that the Baltics are Russian turf and to test NATO\u2019s military responses.\n\nRussia\u2019s current pattern of intercepting NATO ships and aircraft is \u201cmore aggressive and more frequent\u201d than what the Soviet Union authorized pilots to perform during the Cold War, Melnyk said.\n\nUnder Soviet rules of engagement governing intercepts of NATO aircraft, the recent actions would have been forbidden, he said.\n\nSoviet rules governing air intercepts were tightened after the 1983 incident in which Soviet fighter jets shot down a Korean Air Lines 747. Melnyk described this month\u2019s Russian intercepts as \u201creckless,\u201d and said Soviet pilots would have been punished for such maneuvers if commanders had not approved them beforehand:\n\nThese kinds of planned maneuvers are especially dangerous because they bring us very close to an unplanned accident. And any unplanned accident can have grave consequences.\n\nUnderscoring the strain on U.S.-Russian relations after the USS Donald Cook incident, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said the American ship could have fired on the Russian jets.\n\n\u201cIt is reckless. It is provocative. It is dangerous. And under the rules of engagement, that could have been a shoot-down,\u201d Kerry said in an interview with CNN Espanol.\n\nRussia\u2019s Defense Ministry claimed the U.S. version of the incident was \u201cnot consistent with reality\u201d and that the Russian warplanes had \u201cperformed strictly in accordance with the international regulations on the use of airspace.\u201d\n\nEastern Front\n\nNATO-Russian relations chilled in March 2014 after Russia annexed Ukraine\u2019s Crimean Peninsula and began providing military support for pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine.\n\nA senior Obama administration official told The Daily Signal in an email that Wednesday\u2019s NATO-Russia Council meeting \u201cdoes not indicate a return to business as usual between NATO and Russia.\u201d The official added:\n\nAs a direct result of Russia\u2019s actions in Ukraine, NATO decided to suspend all practical civilian and military cooperation with Russia. However, NATO also decided to keep political channels of communication open at the ambassadorial level and above. This meeting is consistent with that policy.\n\nAccording to NATO, the meeting was to focus on the Ukraine conflict as well as the security situation in Afghanistan.\n\nThe meeting comes as fighting in eastern Ukraine continues to escalate in periodic bursts, threatening a complete collapse of the tenuous Minsk II peace accord.\n\nMore than 9,200 Ukrainians have died in the conflict, according to the United Nations.\n\nBuildup\n\nAlso on the docket: improved communications between NATO and Russia to prevent incidents such as the air intercepts from sparking a conflict.\n\nRussia has shown a pattern of provocative actions in Eastern Europe, particularly in the Baltics, for more than two years. These include the alleged abduction of an Estonian intelligence officer on Estonian soil in 2014.\n\nIn July 2015, NATO officials reported the alliance had scrambled warplanes to intercept Russian aircraft more than at any time since the end of the Cold War. And according to U.S. Navy officials, Russian submarine activity in the North Atlantic now matches, and may even exceed, Cold War levels.\n\nSince 2014, the U.S. has boosted its military presence in Eastern Europe to reassure its allies. Troops and warplanes have rotated among NATO countries across the region, and an ongoing exercise to train and equip Ukraine\u2019s armed forces began in summer 2015.\n\nUkraine is not a NATO member state. However, four NATO countries\u2014Canada, Lithuania, Poland, and the U.S.\u2014currently have troops in western Ukraine to train the nation\u2019s military.\n\nIn 2014 the White House launched the European Resistance Initiative, pledging $1 billion to bolster U.S. military forces in Europe as a response to Russia\u2019s military aggression in Ukraine.\n\nRecognizing the long-term security threat Russia poses to the region, the White House included $3.4 billion in its 2017 defense budget for the European Reassurance Initiative\u2014a fourfold increase over the $789 million tagged the previous year.\n\nThe funds finance more U.S. troops in the region, military exercises with allies, and construction of new infrastructure to house troops and store weapons and military hardware.\n\nThe U.S. buildup is intended to shore up confidence among NATO\u2019s eastern members on the reliability of American support; it\u2019s also a strategic deployment of troops and equipment to defend against a Russian attack.\n\nIn March 2015, a U.S. Army Stryker convoy traveled 1,100 miles through the Baltic states and across Eastern Europe on an operation called Dragoon Ride.\n\nThousands of civilians lined the highways waving American flags. At stops along the way, civilians swarmed U.S. troops, shaking hands and taking selfies.\n\nDragoon Ride was touted as a public relations event to reassure allies about U.S. commitment to defend the region.\n\nU.S. troops on the convoy, however, said a secondary objective was to scout routes and analyze road conditions for the rapid deployment of armor across the Baltics in the event of a Russian invasion.\n\nExposure\n\nNATO\u2019s beefed-up military posture along its eastern frontier dates in part from a September 2014 summit in Wales, during which NATO pledged to stockpile supplies and forward-deploy troops in Eastern Europe to repel a Russian attack.\n\nThe Obama administration\u2019s defense budget follows through on that initiative, tagging funds to permanently deploy a full armored combat brigade to the region.\n\nBeginning in February 2017, approximately 4,500 troops will rotate every 90 days among Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Poland, and Romania.\n\nAdditionally, 250 tanks, heavy artillery, and armored personnel carriers will be stockpiled across the region.\n\nEven with the increased U.S. presence, NATO\u2019s Baltic states remain vulnerable to a Russian attack. A recent report by the RAND Corporation, a U.S. think tank, concluded that Russian forces could invade to the edge of Estonia\u2019s capital of Tallinn or the Latvian capital of Riga in 36 to 60 hours.\n\n\u201cAs currently postured, NATO cannot successfully defend the territory of its most exposed members,\u201d the report said.\n\nThe report added that NATO needs seven combat brigades, including three heavy armored brigades, supported with airpower to \u201cprevent the rapid overrun of the Baltic states.\u201d\n\nSubstantial?\n\nThe Kremlin has called the U.S. plan for a rotating combat brigade in Eastern Europe a violation of NATO\u2019s pledge not to forward-deploy troops on the alliance\u2019s eastern frontier.\n\nIn the Russian Founding Act of 1997, NATO pledged not to station a \u201csubstantial\u201d numbers of troops or deploy nuclear weapons among new member states from the former Warsaw Pact.\n\nAt the time, Russia criticized the deal for not setting a specific numerical limit on troop numbers. Now, Washington and Moscow are mincing words over whether a U.S. buildup in Eastern Europe would constitute a \u201csubstantial\u201d increase in troops.\n\n\u201cWe see an unprecedented military buildup since the end of the Cold War and the presence of NATO on the so-called eastern flank of the alliance with the goal of exerting military and political pressure on Russia for containing it,\u201d Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said April 14, according to the Russian news agency TASS.\n\nIn a formal statement on the alliance\u2019s website, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said:", "article_metadata": {"description": "The U.S. and NATO say Russia's pattern of military aggression and reckless brinksmanship across Eastern Europe risks sparking a military conflict.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The U.S. and NATO say Russia's pattern of military aggression and reckless brinksmanship across Eastern Europe risks sparking a military conflict.", "title": "Russian Jets Called \u2018More Aggressive\u2019 Than During Cold War", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160420_NATO_Russia_Peterson_feature.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-04-20T11:45:42+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1SaQhD3"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The U.S. and NATO say Russia's pattern of military aggression and reckless brinksmanship across Eastern Europe risks sparking a military conflict.", "title": "Russian Jets Called \u2018More Aggressive\u2019 Than During Cold War", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160420_NATO_Russia_Peterson_feature.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Security", "tag": "conflict,military", "published_time": "2016-04-20T11:01:38+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-20T11:45:42+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Ukraine, cease-fire, Russia, Putin, NATO, Lavrov, U.S. Army, Victory Day, May 9, World War II, Great Patriotic War"}, "article_summary": "In March 2015, a U.S. Army Stryker convoy traveled 1,100 miles through the Baltic states and across Eastern Europe on an operation called Dragoon Ride.\nRussia says NATO\u2019s military buildup on the alliance\u2019s eastern frontier is a threat to Russian national security.\nHe said the intent of the recent Russian intercepts was likely twofold: To send a diplomatic message to NATO that the Baltics are Russian turf and to test NATO\u2019s military responses.\nAnd according to U.S. Navy officials, Russian submarine activity in the North Atlantic now matches, and may even exceed, Cold War levels.\nRussia has shown a pattern of provocative actions in Eastern Europe, particularly in the Baltics, for more than two years."}
