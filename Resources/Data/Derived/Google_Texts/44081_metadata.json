Instead, the GOP\u2019s attitude appears to have evolved from criticism over details of the deal itself \u2014 which critics say will only ensure Iran\u2019s ability to acquire a nuclear weapon after a decade \u2014 to claims that the process fits into a broader pattern of deception on the part of the Obama administration.\n\n\u201cYou have plenty of time, Mr. Rhodes, to go around and talk to all the media friends and talk to the echo chamber. But when it comes time to actually answer questions under oath, you decide not to do it.\u201d\n\nRepublican criticism has increasingly come to resemble comments about the Affordable Care Act, or ObamaCare, which critics say was marketed around falsehoods that fell apart after the healthcare reform law was passed.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t the fist time this administration on some big policy decision has deceived the American people,\u201d said Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio).\n\nJordan compared Rhodes\u2019s comments to those of Jonathan Gruber, a former administration adviser whose remarks about the healthcare law were vigorously scrutinized by Congress more than a year ago.\n\n\u201cMr. Gruber deceives the American people on ObamaCare,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cAlong comes Mr. Rhodes on the Iranian deal, uses deception to create this false choice [between the deal and war with Iran], helps get this agreement passed.\u201d\n\nIn a New York Times Magazine profile , Rhodes boasted about having created an \u201cecho chamber\u201d of support for the Iran deal before it came to a vote in Congress last summer.\n\nThe article asserted that the White House misled the American public and Capitol Hill by suggesting the nuclear accord was designed to take advantage of a moderating moment within Iran and to avoid a future war with the nation, when actually, the story indicates, the deal was part of a grander plan to realign the United States's stance in the Middle East.\n\nWhile he declined to appear before the House panel on Tuesday, Rhodes defended himself during an afternoon appearance at the Center for New American Security, a think tank. \u201cWhen things like this happen, that\u2019s a part of what happens in Washington,\u201d Rhodes said in response to a question about the magazine story. \u201cThe people who know me know what I care about and know how I approach issues and know what motivates me in this job.\u201d On Capitol Hill, Chaffetz scolded Rhodes for appearing at the think tank event but avoiding his committee.\n\nPublication of the story earlier this month sparked a renewed debate about the merits of the Iran agreement, which went into full effect in January.\n\nFor Democrats, Tuesday\u2019s hearing was just the latest in a stubborn effort to keep fighting the deal.\n\n\u201cThe Republicans rushed to hold this hearing not as a way to obtain substantive information about the merits of the Iran agreement, neither to investigate legitimate allegations,\u201d said Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), the panel\u2019s top Democrat.\n\n\u201cInstead, this hearing is exactly what it purports to condemn: a partisan narrative designed to mislead the American people. That is not just ironic \u2014 that is hypocritical.\u201d\n\nThe White House mocked the committee's efforts to drag Rhodes before the committee in the days before Tuesday\u2019s hearing.\n\n\u201cThe truth is, it is Republicans in Congress who criticized the Iran deal, who have got a lot to explain when it comes to saying things about the Iran deal that didn\u2019t turn out to be true,\u201d White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters on Monday.\n\n\u201cAnd if they want to hold a hearing to determine whether or not Republicans were just wrong and badly misinformed, or if they were purposefully lying to the American people, then they can do that.\u201d\n\nRepublicans attempted to call the administration\u2019s bluff.\n\n\u201cHere I am,\u201d Gosar, a member of the Oversight Committee, said Tuesday. \u201cWhere is Ben Rhodes? I guess you can run and hide.\u201d\n\nCotton, who has previously sparred with Earnest over the Iran deal, had planned to testify following the White House spokesman\u2019s comments. But that offer was contingent on Rhodes\u2019s appearance, lawmakers said.\n\nInstead of hearing from Rhodes and Cotton, lawmakers on Tuesday questioned three foreign policy experts from right-leaning think tanks. Among them was John Hannah, a former official with the George W. Bush administration ahead of the invasion of Iraq.\n\n\u201cI find it incredibly hypocritical to invite Mr. Hannah \u2014 who worked for Dick Cheney and helped market the Iraq War based on false pretenses \u2014 to come now before us as an expert witness on alleged White House false narratives,\u201d said Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.), who opposed the Iran deal but nonetheless criticized the GOP\u2019s continued attacks.\n\n\u201cI find the hypocrisy really beyond belief.\u201d\n\nThe White House had originally appeared to rule out asserting executive privilege to keep Rhodes from testifying before the committee last week but then seemed to backtrack in a letter on Monday, saying he would not appear.\n\nChaffetz has threatened to subpoena Rhodes to bring him before the committee, but the White House could ignore that demand as well.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to get the person who is right in the thick of things from the White House to come here and testify,\u201d Chaffetz said.\n\n\u201cThe White House on Thursday claimed that this wasn\u2019t about executive privilege, and then less than 24 hours before this hearing, they reversed course and said this was about executive privilege,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cNow who\u2019s being inconsistent?\u201d\n\nUpdated at 4:09 p.m. Jordan Fabian contributed.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Ben Rhodes did not attend to discuss his controversial comments on the Iran deal.", "description": "Ben Rhodes did not attend to discuss his controversial comments on the Iran deal.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Julian Hattem", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Ben Rhodes did not attend to discuss his controversial comments on the Iran deal.", "title": "GOP tears into White House aide for hearing no-show", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/280167-gop-tears-into-white-house-aide-for-hearing-no-show", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/rhodesben_082214getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-05-17T16:24:55-04:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-05-17T16:24-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/280167-gop-tears-into-white-house-aide-for-hearing-no-show", "dcterms.date": "2016-05-17T12:01-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Elliot Smilowitz", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Iran deal,Jason Chaffetz, Tom Cotton, Paul Gosar,", "article": {"published_time": "2016-05-17T12:01:04-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-17T16:24:55-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/280167-gop-tears-into-white-house-aide-for-hearing-no-show", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Ben Rhodes did not attend to discuss his controversial comments on the Iran deal.", "card": "summary", "title": "GOP tears into White House aide for hearing no-show"}, "dcterms.title": "GOP tears into White House aide for hearing no-show"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccc98\"", "article_summary": "House Republicans laid into the White House on Tuesday after a senior national security adviser declined to testify on the Obama administration\u2019s nuclear deal with Iran.\n\u201cWe wanted to get the person who is right in the thick of things from the White House to come here and testify,\u201d Chaffetz said.\nChaffetz has threatened to subpoena Rhodes to bring him before the committee, but the White House could ignore that demand as well.\nI guess you can run and hide.\u201dCotton, who has previously sparred with Earnest over the Iran deal, had planned to testify following the White House spokesman\u2019s comments.\nADVERTISEMENT In doing so, House Republicans made clear that their fury over the Iran deal has barely diminished since they failed to scuttle it last year."}
