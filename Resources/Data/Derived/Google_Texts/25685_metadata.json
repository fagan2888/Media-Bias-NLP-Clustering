(The unions didn't do so well when the Supreme Court heard the case.)\n\nBut a split ruling in the abortion case, which is coming from the more conservative 5th Circuit, would represent a blow for women's access to reproductive services, since the lower-court ruling upheld the Texas abortion clinic regulations being challenged.\n\nIf more splits do happen, the Supreme Court may consider these issues again in the future, but it probably won't until the Senate decides to confirm Scalia's replacement -- whether that will be the recently nominated Merrick Garland or someone else is still anyone's guess.\n\nWhich all underscores the need for a fully functioning Supreme Court. As Justice Anthony Kennedy once said at a congressional hearing, 4-4 ties \"mean that everybody\u2019s time is wasted.\"\n\nOr as Scalia himself put it once: \"The Court proceeds with eight Justices, raising the possibility that, by reason of a tie vote, it will find itself unable to resolve the significant legal issue presented by the case.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "The ruling offered a small taste of what an understaffed court is like.", "sailthru.expire_date": "2016-03-23 11:53:16 -0400", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "The ruling offered a small taste of what an understaffed court is like.", "title": "Supreme Court Hands Down First 4-To-4 Decision Since Antonin Scalia's Death", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/supreme-court-first-4-4-split_us_56f1561de4b03a640a6ba559", "image": "http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/56f158c41500002a000b2cf7.jpeg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The ruling offered a small taste of what an understaffed court is like.", "title": "Supreme Court Hands Down First 4-To-4 Decision Since Antonin Scalia's Death", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/56f158c41500002a000b2cf7.jpeg", "height": 1000}, "creator": "@cristianafarias", "site": "@HuffPostPol", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2016-03-22 11:53:16 -0400", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=us_56f1561de4b03a640a6ba559", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "law,Supreme Court,scotus,scalia replacement,merrick garland", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "law,Supreme Court,scotus,scalia replacement,merrick garland", "published_time": "2016-03-22 11:53:16 -0400", "modified_time": "2016-03-22 11:53:16 -0400", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/cristianandreefarias"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "article_summary": "Which all underscores the need for a fully functioning Supreme Court.\nThe Supreme Court on Tuesday issued its first evenly split ruling since the death of Justice Antonin Scalia: a decision in a minor banking case involving spouses who serve as guarantors for each other's debts.\n(The unions didn't do so well when the Supreme Court heard the case.)\nThat means the ruling sets no nationwide precedent and leaves the lower-court ruling as the final decision in the case.\nThe 4-to-4 ruling was \"per curiam,\" which means it was handed down in the name of the entire court, and nobody really knows what justice was on which side."}
