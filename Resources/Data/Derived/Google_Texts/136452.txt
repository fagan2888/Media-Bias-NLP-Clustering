Harley Davidson's sponsored a toy drive in support of the Bay County Sheriff's Office children's charity, Project 25.

The event is one way people can give back this holiday season.

Around 15% of children in Bay County are in need of presents this Christmas.

There are kids out there in the world who aren't as fortunate as others. Some who don't receive many gifts to open up on Christmas morning.

Harley Davidson is partnering with the Bay County Sheriff's Office for the second time in their annual toy drive.

"Last year we helped approximately 400 children, this year we hope to help that many or more."

Project 25 started by a couple of sheriff deputies back in 1980.

"They went to a home where the family had been burglarized and they pulled their money together and went out and bought this family toys and it went from that to two children to 10 children to 50 children and now thousands of children are being benefited by Project 25."

People could stop by Harley and drop off one unwrapped toy and enter for a chance to win a special gift.

"Well we did a lot with the Bay County Sheriff's office several toy runs before and this one I remember coming around this time of the year after Thanksgiving, so I love coming down here and donating," said Bay County resident Greg Speeden.

"Well we wanted to come out to the car show and of course donate some of the people who are unfortunate not to have any," said Calvin Downs.

The time of year where it is more about giving than receiving. A message downs wants to share with his son this holiday season.

"We want everybody to feel that feeling this time of the years and the holidays with the families and friends and giving and receiving is what it's about," said Downs.

If you would like to donate to the toy drive you can drop off any unwrapped toys at the Bay County Sheriff's Office.
