Lindsey Graham told ABC television\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d program.\n\nUntil Congress ended the federal government shutdown in an eleventh-hour vote late Wednesday, the budget and debt crisis that paralyzed Washington largely obscured the health reform\u2019s troubled debut, even as Republican lawmakers were fighting to have it overturned.\n\n\u201cGovernment shutdown: Obamacare dodges a bullet,\u201d the Los Angeles Times summed it up in a headline.\n\nThe site launch was a \u201cgargantuan failure,\u201d said health industry consultant Bob Laszewski of Health Policy and Strategy Associates.\n\nHe estimated that during the federal website\u2019s first two weeks, only 10,000 Americans enrolled for insurance, with the websites in states handling their own exchanges getting mixed results.\n\nAccording to The Washington Post, about 185,000 people had signed up by Wednesday on the state-based exchanges.\n\nThat\u2019s a far cry from the 7 million Americans expected to enroll within the first year, according to estimates by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.\n\nAnd more than 50 million Americans lack health care overall.\n\n\u201cThe health insurance industry is shocked and extremely concerned,\u201d Laszweski said. \u201cThese people who are enrolling are their customers and (insurance companies) are very concerned that there will be service problems as we go forward and that they will be blamed for it. \u2026 They are the ones that would have to lose the money.\u201d\n\nAmid all the criticism, the Obama administration has so far refused to reveal how many Americans have signed up for insurance on its website, promising monthly data starting next month.\n\n\u2018People will lose confidence\u2019\n\n\u201cThis is one of the largest and most complex things we have ever done. Typically, a company launches a project like this in a city, then a few cities,\u201d said independent technology analyst Jeff Kagan. \u201cThey figure out what doesn\u2019t work right and they fix it before they roll it out nationwide. Why the government thinks it doesn\u2019t have to follow the same rules of common sense is a mystery.\u201d\n\nLaszweski warned that unless the Obama administration moves fast to fix the technological glitches, people will lose confidence in Obamacare and the program could fold.\n\n\u201cOnly the sickest people, who are willing to put up with all of the problems \u2014 wait online for the website, wait on the phone for hours \u2014 only the sickest people will sign up for the program, and there won\u2019t be enough healthy people signing up to pay the costs of the unhealthy people,\u201d he said. \u201cThe range of possibilities is anything between they get it fixed shortly to problems causing the entire program to collapse.\u201d\n\nBut White House spokesman Jay Carney stressed that Obama\u2019s reform extends far beyond the websites, and claimed that healthcare.gov had seen more than 17 million unique visitors since its launch. \u201cAlthough the glitches are unacceptable, so is the idea of leaving millions of Americans on their own, including families across the country who now have access to health care that they did not have,\u201d he said. \u201cDespite the glitches that we acknowledge and that absolutely must be fixed, people are getting on and enrolling. They are finding an enormous array of options available to them that weren\u2019t available to them in the past.\u201d\n\nObamacare supporters recall that major social programs such as Medicare health coverage for the elderly and Medicaid for the poor also faced difficulties at first but have since known solid success.\n\nAneesh Chopra, Obama\u2019s former chief technology officer, said the administration had expected about 60,000 people to sign up for an account \u2014 and ended up getting about 250,000. \u201cThey\u2019re looking to find ways to expand that capacity at that account creation step. It will be resolved over the next several weeks. I\u2019m very confident of that,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cHopefully, this will be a footnote in the challenges when we look back on the process.\u201d\n\nOn the very day the site launched, Obama pointed to tech giant Apple as an example. \u201cConsider that just a couple of weeks ago, Apple rolled out a new mobile operating system,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd within days, they found a glitch, so they fixed it. I don\u2019t remember anybody suggesting Apple should stop selling iPhones or iPads \u2014 or threatening to shut down the company if they didn\u2019t.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Technical problems have hobbled the website for signing up millions of uninsured Americans for health care, but they have been largely overshadowed by the", "og": {"site_name": "The Japan Times", "description": "Technical problems have hobbled the website for signing up millions of uninsured Americans for health care, but they have been largely overshadowed by the", "title": "U.S. shutdown obscured rocky debut of 'Obamacare' | The Japan Times", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://d1udmfvw0p7cd2.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/w2-obamagenda-a-20131020-870x580.jpg", "url": "http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2013/10/19/world/politics-diplomacy-world/u-s-shutdown-obscured-rocky-debut-of-obamacare/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Japan Times", "account_id": 7424642, "title": "U.S. shutdown obscured rocky debut of 'Obamacare' | The Japan Times", "image": {"src": "http://d1udmfvw0p7cd2.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/w2-obamagenda-a-20131020.jpg"}, "creator": "@japantimes", "site": "@japantimes", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Technical problems have hobbled the website for signing up millions of uninsured Americans for health care, but they have been largely overshadowed by the"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Japan Times", "robots": "noodp,noydir", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "fb": {"admins": 44702392}, "keywords": "Barack Obama, health", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thejapantimes", "tag": "health"}, "verify-v1": "+h35BdFddo/f1upXot92yGKSB4d5EuWWGbARz9SJE6A=", "thumbnail": "http://d1udmfvw0p7cd2.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/w2-obamagenda-a-20131020-200x200.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2c3a\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe health insurance industry is shocked and extremely concerned,\u201d Laszweski said.\nTechnical problems have hobbled the website for signing up millions of uninsured Americans for health care, but they have been largely overshadowed by the 16-day government shutdown.\n\u201cGovernment shutdown: Obamacare dodges a bullet,\u201d the Los Angeles Times summed it up in a headline.\nAnd more than 50 million Americans lack health care overall.\nwe\u2019re overshadowing how badly Obamacare has been rolled out,\u201d Republican Sen.
