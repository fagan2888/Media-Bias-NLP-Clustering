According to the Congressional Budget Office, more than half the population, or 156 million Americans, were covered by employer-sponsored coverage in 2013.\n\nPlans are being dropped either because they are \u201cillegal\u201d because they do not meet the minimum acceptable coverage regulations under the ACA, or are not being grandfathered in under the new law. The White House had originally stated that only 15 million Americans would be impacted by these cuts.\n\n\u201cThose people are literally losing the coverage they had before because it is changing,\u201d says Paul Howard, senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute. \u201cYou will see people in the individual market with really disruptive changes. Those losing coverage can potentially purchase a more expensive plan outside the exchange, or see if they are eligible for subsidies on exchange.\u201d\n\nAccording to a report from the Kaiser Family Foundation, 52% of people who are currently buying their own insurance will not be eligible for subsidies. Those who are subsidy eligible are individuals making up to $45,000 annually and families of four making up to $94,000 per year.\n\nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services has reported that the average cost for Americans for a mid-tier silver plan will be $328 a month pre-subsidy. Those who opt not to purchase coverage will face a fine of $95 per year, or 1% of their annual income starting in April 2014.\n\nKristin Stoll, consumer health insurance specialist with eHealthInsurance.com, says consumers who are seeing their employer-sponsored coverage cancelled should be sure to enroll in a plan by the end of open enrollment on March 31, 2014.\n\nThe next step is to determine subsidy eligibility, which will help to guide consumers as to whether or not they should be shopping on the federal or state-run exchanges at Healthcare.gov, or on off-exchanges.\n\nPlans sold both on and off-exchange will now have to meet minimum requirements of coverage under the law. Stoll says if the overall subsidy is small, shopping off exchange may be a better option.\n\n\u201cIf their subsidy is minimal and only $100 per year, it may not be worth it when you could have better options off exchange,\u201d she says.", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX BUSINESS/GOVERNMENT AND INSTITUTIONS", "dcterms.modified": "2016-01-10 09:23:12 EST", "dcterms.abstract": "The Manhattan Institute reports 93 million Americans will be getting cancellation notices for their employer-sponsored plans this year.
