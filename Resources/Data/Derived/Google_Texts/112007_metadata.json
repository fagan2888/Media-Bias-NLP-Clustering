(Matt McClain/The Washington Post)\n\nThe Virginia Senate on Wednesday dropped a plan to elect Ken Cuccinelli II to the state Supreme Court after the former Republican attorney general turned down the job offer.\n\nThe House and Senate advanced another conservative candidate after Cuccinelli told Republicans that he was not interested in the position, which would have precluded a potential run for governor in 2017 and forced him to quit campaigning for GOP presidential hopeful Ted Cruz.\n\n\u201cTeiro and I gave serious and prayerful consideration to accepting this honor,\u201d Cuccinelli, referring to his wife, said in a written statement. \u201cAs attractive an opportunity to serve the Commonwealth on the Court would be, it simply is not the right time for our family.\u201d\n\nIn an abrupt turnaround, Republicans who control both the House and Senate moved to install someone else: Appeals Court Judge Stephen R. McCullough, who at one time worked for Cuccinelli and described himself as an admirer of the late U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. McCullough\u2019s nomination came with Cuccinelli\u2019s blessing.\n\nIt was yet another surprise move in a Supreme Court drama that has been churning since summer.\n\nNeither chamber took a final vote on McCullough on Wednesday, but Republicans appeared to have the votes to do so before the General Assembly session concludes on Saturday.\n\nSome liberal activists, who flocked to the Capitol wearing pink \u201cStopKen\u201d stickers, took credit for thwarting Cuccinelli\u2019s judgeship.\n\n\u201cToday we saw the power of Virginia\u2019s progressive community,\u201d Anna Scholl , executive director of Progress Virginia, said in a written statement. \u201cIn less than 24 hours, thousands of Virginians stood up to keep Ken Cuccinelli out of our judiciary.\u201d\n\nBut others said the GOP had clearly won the tactical fight with McAuliffe. Some said Republicans had offered Cuccinelli as a diversion, to make McCullough appear more acceptable by comparison, although Republicans said they sincerely wanted Cuccinelli on the bench.\n\nThe Virginia General Assembly, one of only two state legislatures empowered to pick judges, has spent months tussling with Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) over how to fill the vacancy on the state\u2019s highest court.\n\nMcAuliffe had originally appointed Jane Marum Roush, a widely respected jurist from Northern Virginia with 22 years of trial court experience, in July when the legislature was in recess.\n\nRepublicans, angry that they had not been consulted, refused to make Roush\u2019s appointment permanent. Instead, they offered to elevate a black appeals court judge, Rossie Alston, into the slot and move another black judge up to fill his spot. That scenario appealed to some members of the Senate\u2019s black caucus, but after a few flirtations, none went along with the plan.\n\nNow the House and Senate are poised to move McCullough, a white man, onto the Supreme Court.\n\nSen. L. Louise Lucas (D-Portsmouth), who briefly agreed to back Alston but later reneged, said ruefully that Democrats got little from the mess. \u201cWe lost Judge Roush, and we ended up empty-handed,\u201d she said.\n\nMcAuliffe spokesman Brian Coy described the day\u2019s events as a \u201ccircus\u201d and said that Republicans have \u201cdone untold damage to the independence of the Commonwealth\u2019s highest court.\u201d\n\nMcCullough\u2019s name surfaced one day after Senate Republicans proposed Cuccinelli for the top judicial post. The move inflamed liberal activists, who regard the former attorney general as hostile to abortion rights, gay rights and climate-change science.\n\n[Virginia Senate panel proposes Cuccinelli for state Supreme Court]\n\nCuccinelli is one of the most polarizing figures in Virginia politics. He earned national attention for battles he waged as attorney general against abortion rights, the Affordable Care Act and other perceived examples of federal overreach. Tea party activists regard him as a hero, while liberals revile him.\n\nHe narrowly lost the 2013 race for governor and has publicly mulled making another bid in 2017. Taking the judgeship would have forced him off of the political stage, since judges are prohibited from engaging in political activity.\n\nThe Senate advanced McCullough\u2019s name on Wednesday, and the House Courts of Justice Committee quickly convened a hearing to interview him and then unanimously voted to certify him.\n\n\u201cSteve is a man that is full of integrity. He is very intelligent, the kind of person we are looking for,\u201d said House Speaker William J. Howell (R-Stafford) as he introduced the appeals court judge.\n\nSenate Republicans only recently came up with the plan to fill Roush\u2019s slot with Cuccinelli. Sen. Richard Stuart (R-Stafford), called to ask Cuccinelli if he wanted the job either Monday or Tuesday, according to three people who spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to discuss private caucus maneuvering.\n\nStuart declined to comment on the timing of the offer. Cuccinelli did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nMcCullough, 44, who started his legal career as a clerk to a state Supreme Court judge, told the House panel that he wanted a spot on the high court to preserve the state\u2019s heritage of freedom.\n\nHe said he would model himself after Scalia. \u201cI would undertake a similar approach, which is look to the original public meaning and then look to precedent and determine how far astray are we and do we need to rethink this,\u201d he said.\n\nMcCullough\u2019s legal writings show a conservative outlook. In 2013, the appeals court judge wrote a law review article arguing that the Virginia Constitution protected an individual\u2019s right to own guns.\n\nHe cautioned against large government spending in a 2012 article scrutinizing the constitutionality of transportation funding methods.\n\n\u201cPerhaps the overarching lesson of these clauses for our time is that amassing large debts under favorable economic conditions, with overly optimistic projections for future repayment, will lead to financial hardship and political turmoil,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAlthough that may seem an obvious point, it repeatedly has been ignored throughout history.\u201d\n\nIn 2014, McCullough was one of nine candidates vetted for their qualifications for the state Supreme Court by a committee of the Virginia State Bar. He received multiple unfavorable votes, with five of 16 committee members saying he was not qualified for the highest court, although their reasons were not included in the committee report. Other reviewers complimented McCullough, saying he has \u201cthe highest integrity\u201d and comes across as \u201cbright, articulate and witty.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Senate advances yet another name for the Virginia Supreme Court.", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/laura.vozzella", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The Senate advances yet another name for the Virginia Supreme Court.", "title": "Va.
