So far, President Obama has made a few speeches urging people to sign up for the law and White House Press Secretary has berated Obamacare critics from the briefing room. But now, Organizing for Action, Obama's left over campaign wing, is urging people to \"get talking\" while they sit around at Christmas time in their pajamas. They sent the following photo out last night on Barack Obama's Twitter feed.\n\nHow do you plan to spend the cold days of December? http://t.co/Rwf5AYc3bG #GetTalking pic.twitter.com/PBQ397yLf4 \u2014 Barack Obama (@BarackObama) December 17, 2013\n\nThe jokes write themselves, but my take is that the Obama administration wants American males living in their parents' basements forever. Over to you, Andrea Tantaros:\n\nLook at how they portray the American male: a hot chocolate drinking doofus in a onesie. Disgraceful. pic.twitter.com/Ov1wAaShk0 \u2014 Andrea Tantaros (@AndreaTantaros) December 17, 2013\n\nThe embarrassing \"get talking\" campaign comes at a time when millennials are abandoning Obamacare and President Obama in droves.\n\nYoung Americans are turning against Barack Obama and Obamacare, according to a new survey of millennials, people between the ages of 18 and 29 who are vital to the fortunes of the president and his signature health care law.\n\n\n\nObama's approval rating among young Americans is just 41 percent, down 11 points from a year ago, and now tracking with all adults. While 55 percent said they voted for Obama in 2012, only 46 percent said they would do so again.\n\n\n\nWhen asked if they would want to recall various elected officials, 45 percent of millennials said they would oust their member of Congress; 52 percent replied \"all members of Congress\" should go; and 47 percent said they would recall Obama. The recall-Obama figure was even higher among the youngest millennials, ages 18 to 24, at 52 percent.\n\nIf you like your onesie, you can keep your onesie.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Three weeks ago the Obama administration desperately launched a new public relations campaign in an effort to make Obamacare popular with the American people..05/25/2016 14:23:20PM EST.", "author": "Katie Pavlich", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Three weeks ago the Obama administration desperately launched a new public relations campaign in an effort to make Obamacare popular with the American people.", "title": "- New Obamacare PR Campaign: Get Talking in Your Jammies", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2013/12/18/new-obamacare-pr-campaign-get-talking-in-your-jammies-n1765077", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2013/12/18/0.png", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Three weeks ago the Obama administration desperately launched a new public relations campaign in an effort to make Obamacare popular with the American people.", "title": "- New Obamacare PR Campaign: Get Talking in Your Jammies", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2013/12/18/new-obamacare-pr-campaign-get-talking-in-your-jammies-n1765077", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2013/12/18/0.png", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "New Obamacare PR Campaign: Get Talking in Your Jammies, Katie Pavlich, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd72e4\"", "article_summary": "pic.twitter.com/Ov1wAaShk0 \u2014 Andrea Tantaros (@AndreaTantaros) December 17, 2013The embarrassing \"get talking\" campaign comes at a time when millennials are abandoning Obamacare and President Obama in droves.\nThree weeks ago the Obama administration desperately launched a new public relations campaign in an effort to make Obamacare popular with the American people.\nBut now, Organizing for Action, Obama's left over campaign wing, is urging people to \"get talking\" while they sit around at Christmas time in their pajamas.\nSo far, President Obama has made a few speeches urging people to sign up for the law and White House Press Secretary has berated Obamacare critics from the briefing room.\nhttp://t.co/Rwf5AYc3bG #GetTalking pic.twitter.com/PBQ397yLf4 \u2014 Barack Obama (@BarackObama) December 17, 2013The jokes write themselves, but my take is that the Obama administration wants American males living in their parents' basements forever."}
