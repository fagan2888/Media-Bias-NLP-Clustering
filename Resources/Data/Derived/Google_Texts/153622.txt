SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. — Right-handed reliever John Axford and his $2.6 million contract have been selected by the Rockies. He’s now on the 40-man roster and all indications are that he will break camp on the 25-man roster.

To make room for Axford, the club placed placed right-handed pitcher Tyler Chatwood on the 60-day disabled list. Chatwood is rehabbing from Tommy John elbow surgery he underwent last July.

Axford, 31, signed a minor-league deal Feb. 2 after splitting time between Cleveland and Pittsburgh in 2014. He made 62 appearances last season and went 2-4 with 10 saves and a 3.95 ERA.

The former closer chose Colorado because he saw an opportunity to pitch with the game on the line.

“I had opportunities elsewhere, but the Rockies were the team I chose, because I think I can play a big role here,” Axford said early in spring training.

Axford notched nine saves in 10 opportunities with the Indians through May 3 last season. Then he ran into trouble because of an ugly combination of walks followed by home runs.

Chatwood, who is in camp and working out, said he’s aiming to be back this summer.

“I don’t know for sure, but I would expect to pitch sometime this year,” he said last week. “It’s kind of up to the (Rockies) as far as how fast I progress.”

Chatwood went 8-5 (3.15 ERA) in 2013 and was pegged as a middle-of-the-rotation starter last spring. But he pitched just four games before injuring his arm.

With spring training underway, he’s taking it slow getting his arm back in shape under a strict rehab plan.

“No problems at all,” he said. “But I know it’s a slow process.”
