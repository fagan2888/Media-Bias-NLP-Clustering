The prisoner stated he thought Gray was trying to hurt himself intentionally. During the alleged incident the prisoner was separated from Gray by a metal barrier.\n\nThe correspondence with the prisoner and the Baltimore investigator offers the first insight into what could have transpired while Gray was in the transport van. Currently, it is unclear if any of the investigation has unearthed evidence that supports the prisoner\u2019s version of the events.\n\nOn April 12, Gray was found in an unconscious state in the back of the transport van when he was brought to the Baltimore police station. He suffered a spinal cord injured that tore 80 percent of his spine just below the brain stem.\n\nRiots have ensued in many metropolitan areas across the nation in support of Gray and his family. Last night, hundreds of people were arrested in Baltimore from acts that led to injured police officers. Angry Baltimore residents took to the streets, looting and pillaging business and parked cars.\n\nBy Alex Lemieux\n\nSource:\n\nWashington Post\n\nPhoto by Vladmir Badikov \u2013 Creativecommons Flickr License\n\nShare this: Print\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nPocket\n\nReddit\n\nEmail\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle\n\nFacebook\n\nTumblr\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Guardian Liberty Voice", "description": "According to a prisoner that was in the police transport van with Freddie Gray, he could hear him, \u201cbanging against the walls,\u201d of the van.
