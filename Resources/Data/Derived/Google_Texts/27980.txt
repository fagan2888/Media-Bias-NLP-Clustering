WASHINGTON â€” Join me today for a live chat about the 114th Congress and what to expect from the New Jersey congressional delegation.

As NJ Advance Media's Washington correspondent, I will start answering questions at 9 a.m. about the delegation, key issues, and what you can expect in 2015.

U.S. Sens. Robert Menendez and Cory Booker (D-N.J.) will be in the minority. The state's 12-member U.S. House delegation is evenly split between Republicans, who control the chamber, and Democrats. As the longest serving House member from New Jersey, Rep. Chris Smith (R-4th Dist.) will be the dean of the delegation.

One of the issues facing New Jersey's senators is President Obama's decision to move toward diplomatic relations with Cuba.

Among the questions we are awaiting answers to are these: Will the Republicans who now control both houses of Congress work with President Obama or confront him? Can both sides agree on tweaks to the Affordable Care Act? Will Congress formally authorize the use of force against the Islamic State? What is the future of Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst?

Some of you have already submitted questions, and I will answer those as well any others you send me, both before and during the chat. Feel free to contact me in advance at jsalant@njadvancemedia.com, or tweet them at @JDSalant.
