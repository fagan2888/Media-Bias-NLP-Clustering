(AP) - A record number of North Dakota residents can carry a hidden firearm nearly anywhere they want to go, leading to a pistol-packing population that has more than doubled in less than four years.\n\nThat\u2019s due, in part, \u201cto major crimes getting headlines,\u201d threats of federal anti-gun laws and a dramatic rise in concealed-carry instructors pitching firearms for self-defense, Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem said.\n\n\u201cI think people feel fairly safe in North Dakota,\u201d said Stenehjem, the state\u2019s top law enforcement officer. \u201cPeople obtain concealed-carry permits for a variety of reasons and personal safety is one of them.\u201d\n\nFor more than a year, Stenehjem\u2019s office is seeing up to three dozen concealed carry applications per day, he said, with most coming from western North Dakota\u2019s oil-producing region, and many from women. North Dakota has 38,898 people who hold concealed weapon permits, up from about 16,000 in 2011, State Bureau of Criminal Investigation records show. The data does not give a breakdown of the number of men versus the number of women who apply or receive permits, an agency spokeswoman said.\n\nLeading the nation in population growth, North Dakota has a strong economy thanks to the western oil fields, which have attracted thousands to take up residence and given the state its largest population: more than 739,000 residents, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nA \u201cchanging North Dakota\u201d is the reason Kim Iverson of Bismarck got her concealed-carry permit two years ago with her husband and his parents. The 31-year-old nurse and mother of two young children said her husband, who is in the military, is away from home \u201csporadically and for long periods of time.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith all the changes going on in the state, it just made me feel better and my husband feel better,\u201d she said.\n\nNorth Dakota\u2019s crime rate per capita last year rose 4.4 percent from 2013, due in part to a \u201cworrisome\u201d record increase in illegal drug activity, Stenehjem said.\n\nThe Republican-led Legislature approved a spate of pro-gun legislation this year that allow a concealed-carry permit holder to pack heat in public parks, rest areas and liquor stores, and at political functions and concerts.\n\nStenehjem said his office denied 861 concealed-carry permit applications last year, mostly due to applicants having criminal records. Per the new law, authorities are allowed to tell someone why they were denied, which was prohibited prior to Aug. 1.\n\nAbout 140 instructors are authorized to teach the state\u2019s mandatory, hour-long concealed carry classes, up more than 100 from three years ago. The classes, during which applicants must pass an open-book test, cost about $100. Additional testing requirements, including actually firing a gun, are necessary for permit holders to have reciprocity with 38 other states.\n\nBruce Potts, owner of Valley City-based Dakota Carry LLC, has taught classes for about five years to \u201ceveryone from college students to senior citizens.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am seeing an uptick in the number of women and I think a lot of them are doing it on their own, and not being coerced by their husbands or boyfriends,\u201d he said.\n\nMost of Potts\u2019 students are from eastern North Dakota and \u201cthe vast majority of them aren\u2019t carrying - they\u2019re doing it so they can legally transport and store guns in their vehicles.\n\n\u201cBut in the western part of the state where they are blessed with oil, I\u2019d have to say that number is reversed,\u201d Potts said. \u201cIt\u2019s not Mayberry out there anymore.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A record number of North Dakota residents can carry a hidden firearm nearly anywhere they want to go, leading to a pistol-packing population that has more than doubled in less than four years.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A record number of North Dakota residents can carry a hidden firearm nearly anywhere they want to go, leading to a pistol-packing population that has more than doubled in less than four years.", "title": "Concealed carry gun permits up sharply in North Dakota", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/8/concealed-carry-gun-permits-up-sharply-in-north-da/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/08/4140c56f6ac186237e0f6a70670010e2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/08/4140c56f6ac186237e0f6a70670010e2.jpg", "description": "A record number of North Dakota residents can carry a hidden firearm nearly anywhere they want to go, leading to a pistol-packing population that has more than doubled in less than four years.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Concealed carry gun permits up sharply in North Dakota"}, "Author": "JAMES MacPHERSON", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbdd6\"", "article_summary": "North Dakota has 38,898 people who hold concealed weapon permits, up from about 16,000 in 2011, State Bureau of Criminal Investigation records show.\n\u201cI think people feel fairly safe in North Dakota,\u201d said Stenehjem, the state\u2019s top law enforcement officer.\nA \u201cchanging North Dakota\u201d is the reason Kim Iverson of Bismarck got her concealed-carry permit two years ago with her husband and his parents.\nMost of Potts\u2019 students are from eastern North Dakota and \u201cthe vast majority of them aren\u2019t carrying - they\u2019re doing it so they can legally transport and store guns in their vehicles.\nStenehjem said his office denied 861 concealed-carry permit applications last year, mostly due to applicants having criminal records."}
