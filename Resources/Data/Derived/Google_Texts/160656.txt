C-. Senators need to be straight with their constituents. Alaskans might not always agree with me, but I will always be honest and tell them where I stand. We need to put political differences aside so we can work together. We could get a lot more done if all senators worked together as Senator Murkowski and I do. We voted together 80% of the time this year -- more than any other bipartisan delegation in the Senate.
