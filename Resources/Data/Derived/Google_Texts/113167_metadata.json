Supplying the unborn fetus with oxygenated, nutrient rich blood from the placenta, the cord is physiologically and genetically part of the fetus. It may be even useful even after the baby is born, providing clues for identifying which babies are born addicted to drugs.\n\nWhen a baby is delivered, a section of the umbilical cord can now be snipped off and sent to ARUP laboratories to be analyzed for drugs and drug metabolites. ARUP was the second lab in the country to begin offering cord testing (since August 2012), which has logistical advantages to the traditional testing method for newborns and drug exposure. Meconium, another name for an infant\u2019s first stool, used to be the preferred method of determining the presence of drugs in an infant\u2019s system. Waiting for the stool to pass wastes valuable time, however, and the umbilical cord can be snipped and sent to the lab immediately following the birth.\n\nQuickly identifying which infants have been exposed to drugs (and which drugs they\u2019ve been exposed to) is vital because neonatal specialists must know what they\u2019re dealing with before treating symptoms for withdrawal. If there is a medical reason or suspicion to believe the mother is at high risk for drug use, the delivery team may choose to send the umbilical cord for testing, which can take up to 72 hours. It varies by hospital, but generally, testing the baby for drugs doesn't require a mother's consent.\n\n\u201cSometimes babies are already in the throes of withdrawal symptoms but physicians can\u2019t determine what drugs they are dealing with until test results are available,\u201d said Dr. Gwen McMillin, medical director of ARUP's Clinical Toxicology Laboratories, in a press release.\n\nLike any addict who suddenly ceases their drug intake, babies have severe physiological withdrawal symptoms. Newborns born with a drug addiction suffer from neonatal abstinence syndrome, and may have symptoms like diarrhea, seizures, sensitivity to light, and hyperactive reflexes. Some babies, depending on the drug their mother was addicted to, will carry the consequences for life, experiencing brain damage and learning disabilities. The most common drug ARUP identifies is marijuana, followed by opioids, such as heroin and prescription painkillers. Sometimes, there is a mix of illicit and prescription drugs found in an infant\u2019s system.\n\n\u201cThe symptoms of neonatal abstinence syndrome depend on the type of drug the mother used, how long it takes for the body to metabolize and eliminate the drug, how much of the drug she was taking and for how long,\u201d explains McMillin, who also adds that being born premature can be another variable in determining symptoms.\n\nThe American Medical Association estimates that in the U.S., one infant suffering from neonatal abstinence syndrome was born every hour in 2009.\n\n\u201cThe work we\u2019re doing here is about the human condition; it is about the safety of children \u2014 as the risk of child abuse and neglect increases in cases of maternal drug abuse,\u201d McMillin said. \u201cThis is also about getting mothers the care and support they need through rehab and social services so they can take care of their children.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "umbilical, cord, may, tell, us, what, drugs, baby, was, exposed, womb", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The umbilical cord can now be used as a faster way to test for drugs in a newborn's system, allowing professionals to address withdrawal symptoms effectively.", "title": "Umbilical Cords Can Tell Us Which Drugs A Baby Is Addicted To At Birth", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/umbilical-cord-may-tell-us-what-drugs-baby-was-exposed-womb-343658", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/07/18/newborn.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The umbilical cord can now be used as a faster way to test for drugs in a newborn's system, allowing professionals to address withdrawal symptoms effectively.", "title": "Umbilical Cords Can Tell Us Which Drugs A Baby Is Addicted To At Birth", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/umbilical-cord-may-tell-us-what-drugs-baby-was-exposed-womb-343658", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/07/18/newborn.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/07/18/newborn.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Innovation", "published_time": "2015-07-18T13:53:47-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-18T13:53:46-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The umbilical cord can now be used as a faster way to test for drugs in a newborn's system, allowing professionals to address withdrawal symptoms effectively."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2ddb\"", "article_summary": "When a baby is delivered, a section of the umbilical cord can now be snipped off and sent to ARUP laboratories to be analyzed for drugs and drug metabolites.\nWaiting for the stool to pass wastes valuable time, however, and the umbilical cord can be snipped and sent to the lab immediately following the birth.\nThe umbilical cord is a vital part of pregnancy.\nIt may be even useful even after the baby is born, providing clues for identifying which babies are born addicted to drugs.\nQuickly identifying which infants have been exposed to drugs (and which drugs they\u2019ve been exposed to) is vital because neonatal specialists must know what they\u2019re dealing with before treating symptoms for withdrawal."}
