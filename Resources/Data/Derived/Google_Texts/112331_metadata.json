Kate Brown and other political forces in Oregon are standing behind a landmark request for $100 million for new affordable housing that will face off against budget realities and concerns about whether now is the time for that kind of investment.\n\nIf the funds are approved, Oregon would create a program involving state-ownership of as many as 4,000 new housing units that developers would build using money from the Oregon Housing and Community Services agency. The state wouldn\u2019t act as landlord, the agency says, but it would own the units and work with developers who build them and contractors that manage them.\n\nAny money toward the request would go to build housing to address a need that lawmakers and agency officials say is prevalent and growing in every corner of the state. Despite the need, it\u2019s uncertain how much money the Legislature will agree to give to the effort when lawmakers consider all bonding and budget requests in coming weeks.\n\nMargaret Van Vliet, director of Housing and Community Services, said the money would act as a catalyst for developers currently creating affordable housing in Oregon.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve said to everybody, I\u2019ll take every dollar I can get. The need is huge,\u201d Van Vliet said in a recent interview with The Bulletin.\n\nBend\u2019s rental vacancy rate is less than 1 percent, but the town, and its surrounding neighbors in Central Oregon where the market is similarly tight, aren\u2019t alone.\n\nCommunities across Oregon \u2014 including Portland \u2014 have thousands of residents who can\u2019t afford to rent a home in the private market, Van Vliet and others say, and state officials fear the lack of housing can lead to other social issues such as homelessness and poor health that can strain public resources.\n\nThe agency estimates $100 million would be enough for 3,000 to 4,000 new units, though the number has fluctuated and still has skeptics.\n\nEven if all units were built, that\u2019s a small ways toward addressing the overall need in Oregon, but it would mark a significant increase over the estimated 1,300 units per year built through the agency.\n\nIf the Legislature approves the request, Van Vliet says the agency would encourage private developers who compete for the money to use it in a way that spreads each dollar to build as many units as possible.\n\n\u201cThere is extreme pressure among low-income people. There\u2019s extreme pressure and it\u2019s really hard. Any new units will make a difference,\u201d Van Vliet said.\n\nThe request was initially unveiled in the proposed budget of former Gov. John Kitzhaber in December. Gov. Kate Brown has picked up where Kitzhaber left off after succeeding him after he resigned in February, offering her support to the agency\u2019s request during her State of the State address.\n\nHer office, says Brown\u2019s housing and human services policy adviser, Dani Ledezma, is committed to advocating for the package in the Legislature this session.\n\n\u201cMaking sure that there\u2019s an array of housing affordable to Oregonians is a top priority for her. She\u2019s prepared to really carry a lot of the weight and wanting to make sure that together with the Legislature we have more resources for affordable housing,\u201d Ledezma said.\n\nThe money would be a new source that would come with fewer restrictions and requirements attached to federal tax credits and other money for affordable housing development, agency officials and the governor\u2019s office said.\n\nThat would make it easier for the state to approve money where it\u2019s needed and quickly get the new units built.\n\nWith the $100 million, which would come from the sale of bonds around 2017, the state wants to inject money into projects designed to help alleviate some of the need while the overall housing market evens out over time and rent goes down.\n\nThe state will also look at what other money and grants it can pair with any new bonding money to compound the effect of the program.\n\nBrown and the agency are also backed by dozens of local housing groups, including in Central Oregon, and from other key players in the Legislature, like House Speaker Tina Kotek, D-Portland.\n\n\u201cI think this kind of fits in that category of pushing ourselves to think of this as a public good,\u201d said Kotek, who noted she was initially \u201cskeptical\u201d about the request.\n\nKotek said the $100 million \u201cis very much in line with what the crisis is\u201d and that the request could have been bigger.\n\nWhile no one questions whether there is need for more affordable housing, some caution the state needs to be diligent before approving such a large sum.\n\nSen. Richard Devlin, D-Tualatin, who heads the state\u2019s budget committee, has said the request may be reduced while it competes with other bonding requests. He said any bonding authority that is approved \u201cwill be an obligation of the state for the next 20, 30 years.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn many of the areas, the actual need is not in the tens of millions, or the hundred millions, it\u2019s in the billions,\u201d Devlin said. \u201cIf we make the wrong decisions here, we won\u2019t be able to make the right decisions later.\u201d\n\nDevlin\u2019s caution as head budget-writer isn\u2019t surprising. He said he\u2019s not an adamant opponent or proponent of the Housing and Community Services request. But he urged care in part because of the innovative nature of the state ownership and because the request is large.\n\nThe agency overall has come under scrutiny from Bend\u2019s Republican legislators, who filed bills to mandate how the agency spends money it handles and tried to highlight the agency\u2019s past inability to get money out the door and into building projects.\n\nThe Legislature in 2009 created a $15 fee collected by counties to generate money for affordable housing, and later added a $5 fee to help veterans with housing. Together that document recording fee has raised nearly $58 million.\n\nCentral Oregon Republicans and some housing officials said the agency wasn\u2019t spending the money quickly enough and lacked transparency despite a growing need across the state.\n\nSen. Tim Knopp, R-Bend, said he could get on board with the size and scope of the request \u201cunder certain circumstances,\u201d though he didn\u2019t endorse the request.\n\n\u201cI think the most important thing with any expenditure \u2014 whether it\u2019s $100 million for housing or bonding for transportation \u2014 that there are the appropriate sideboards and accountability,\u201d Knopp said, adding he hadn\u2019t kept up with the latest updates for the request.\n\nScott Cooper, executive director of Redmond-based NeighborImpact, said he fears with additional building, community action groups would be stretched too thin on the services they provide.\n\n\u201cWe are fully committed on the housing stock we\u2019ve got. So any conversation about housing capital investment needs to be accompanied by a conversation about services,\u201d Cooper said.\n\nVan Vliet said her department acknowledged decisions by past officials at the agency led it to build up money before spending it, which is a policy she said she\u2019s since changed. She said the agency now doesn\u2019t stockpile money in all its accounts and can forecast how much it can spend.\n\nShe said the money for new units now would help vulnerable families that would eventually take stress off of other social safety programs.\n\n\u201cI think that while we couldn\u2019t quantify it today, I think we can reasonably assume \u2026 that it\u2019s a good public investment beyond just the real estate. That it will help families stabilize,\u201d she said.\n\n\u2014 Reporter: 406-589-4347,\n\ntanderson@bendbulletin.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "SALEM \u2014 Gov.
