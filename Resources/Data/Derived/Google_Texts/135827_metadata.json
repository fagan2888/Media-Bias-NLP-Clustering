This is based on the fact that 2014 was a \u201chigh water mark\u201d in terms of IPO activity. Last year saw the highest number of IPOs in biotech and life sciences since 1978, he said.\n\n[Also: Fitch Ratings bullish on for-profit healthcare]\n\nThere wasn\u2019t one company or technology that was a \u201cwindow opener\u201d for the sector, either. Instead, Reikes attributes the sectors\u2019 growth to its general maturity. Businesses in healthcare are getting better at managing money, risk, clinical trials and regulatory hurdles. This has helped more drugs get through the approval process more quickly.\n\nThe whole healthcare market seems now to be driven by what Reikes dubs \u201cmicromarkets\u201d that are characterized by briefer and more muted ups and downs, as we\u2019ve seen over the past 15 months. The downturns, which will come, should be short-lived, he said, \u201cUnless we see a repeat of 2008 and the broad financial disruption that ensued.\u201d\n\nAssuming the world holds together, here are some of the other areas experts predict will see a boom in 2015.\n\nMergers and affiliations\n\nMergers and acquisitions have been an industry trend for a couple of years and PJ Camp, principal and co-founder of Hammond Hanlon Camp LLC, expects this to continue in 2015.\n\nOne new movement in this area is affiliations between independent hospitals, health systems and, even more recently, post-acute care providers.\n\nReadmission penalties have required hospitals to work better with post-acute care providers. In some instances, they are merging and affiliating to have even more control.\n\n\u201cBefore reform, hospitals were incentivized the opposite way. If a patient\u2019s recovery didn\u2019t go well, and they had to return to the hospital, it meant more income for the hospital,\u201d Camp said. \u201cThe ACA has flipped that around.\u201d\n\nReal estate\n\nThere are other areas of care that hospitals are taking on as well, Camp said. Hospitals are developing buildings that will expand services like dialysis, imaging and infusions in order to broader their patient services and reduce inpatient care.\n\n\u201cNew, larger mega clinics are the types of buildings in the community designed to do this,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are designed to be well-suited for patients\u2019 needs under the ACA and \u2026 a visitor is diagnosed and treated in one facility.\u201d\n\nWhat Camp calls \u201cglorified gyms\u201d are another movement into real estate by providers. Workout facilities that include a clinical, rehabilitation or health improvement component are also popping up around the country. Wellness is the motivation for these facilities, as people become more responsible for an increasing amount of their healthcare costs.\n\nPrice transparency\n\nThe increase in individual patients\u2019 out-of-pocket responsibility has also created a market for price transparency. Camp said the next couple of years should see increasing movement in this realm.\n\nThe consumer market may be in its nascent phase, but Castlight\u2019s IPO this spring \u2013 valuing the company at $3 billion \u2013 illustrated the sector\u2019s potential.\n\n\u201cThere has been a lot of investment in that space,\u201d said Raymond Falci, managing director of Cain Brothers & Co. LLC. \u201cWe are seeing accelerating momentum with businesses that can help the consumer better manage his or her access to the healthcare system.\u201d\n\nFalci expects this sector to \u201ccome into its own\u201d in 2015.\n\nPatient engagement\n\nReaching the patient will also go beyond providing price transparency in 2015. Patient engagement is a trend that burgeoned in 2014 and should have continued forward motion next year.\n\nAs physicians are held accountable for patient care and take on greater risk, they will be investing in ways to touch patients as they leave their offices. Payers are also looking for ways to more effectively deliver care and they will have to get closer to patients to do it, Falci said.\n\nFollow Healthcare Finance on Twitter and LinkedIn.\n\nBillions were invested in patient engagement technologies in 2014 and Falci said that should continue in 2015. There should be movement in areas like personal health trackers and call centers, points where nurses can reach out to patients after discharge to help prevent readmissions.\n\nHere comes ICD-10\n\nOne change that could spur dramatic spending in the market in 2015 is the transition to ICD-10.\n\nOutsourcing companies both domestically and offshore have built up teams of trained coders in anticipation of the deadline, and they should see demand accelerate mid-2015 to the compliance date of October 1.\n\n[Also: Social media momentum continues around ICD-10 deadline]\n\n\u201cI\u2019m comparing this to what the large Y2K phenomenon was feared to be,\u201d Falci said. \u201cThere are a lot of service providers in technology and outsourcing that are going to see meaningful opportunities due to this.\u201d\n\nTwitter: @HFNewsTweet", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/experts-see-big-jump-2015-healthcare-investments", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/hospital-tech-lab-feature.gif", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "All healthcare subsectors -- services, IT, medical devices and life sciences -- are benefiting from open equity and demand for products and services.", "title": "Experts see big jump in 2015 healthcare investments"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HC_Finance", "image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/hospital-tech-lab-feature.gif"}, "description": "All healthcare subsectors -- services, IT, medical devices and life sciences -- are benefiting from open equity and demand for products and services.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Experts see big jump in 2015 healthcare investments"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Peter Reikes, vice chairman at Stifel, has worked in healthcare investment banking for 30 years, but says the current market is about as \u201copen and robust\u201d as he\u2019s ever seen.&#13; \u201cThe market is in exceptional shape right now,\u201d he said.&#13; All healthcare subsectors \u2013 services, IT, medical devices and life sciences \u2013 are benefitting from open equity and demand for products and services.", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "All healthcare subsectors -- services, IT, medical devices and life sciences -- are benefiting from open equity and demand for products and services.\nAll healthcare subsectors \u2013 services, IT, medical devices and life sciences \u2013 are benefitting from open equity and demand for products and services.\nThe whole healthcare market seems now to be driven by what Reikes dubs \u201cmicromarkets\u201d that are characterized by briefer and more muted ups and downs, as we\u2019ve seen over the past 15 months.\nThe spot he predicts to have the biggest boom in 2015 is life sciences, particularly biotech and specialty pharmaceuticals.\nHospitals are developing buildings that will expand services like dialysis, imaging and infusions in order to broader their patient services and reduce inpatient care."}
