Spending on health care in the U.S. has been down since the recession, but the Office of the Actuary at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services says thatâ€™s going to change.

Its latest 10-year look-ahead shows spending to grow an average of 5.7 percent per year from 2013 to 2023. With the 3.6 percent rate of 2013 and estimated 5.6 percent hike in 2014 eliminated from the formula, the rate should jump to 6 percent annually between 2015 and 2023.
