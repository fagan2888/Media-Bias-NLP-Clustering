He was shot several times by police and died at an area hospital, according to Chief Robert White.\n\nThe man had not fired his weapon.\n\n\u201cFortunately, no one other than the suspect was injured,\u201d White said.\n\nWhite declined to elaborate on the undercover operation because it surrounded ongoing police work. He also declined to discuss whether other law enforcement agencies were involved in the operation.\n\nThe second shooting occurred at a funeral home on Tejon Street near West Elk Place. Police say four officers were attempting to serve felony vehicle-theft warrants to a 21-year-old suspect.\n\n\u201cI have no early indication that he had a weapon,\u201d Murray said. Investigators are working to determine what made the officers who shot feel threatened.\n\nThe cause of the shooting is under investigation.\n\nA witness said the suspect was attending a service at the Romero Family Funeral Home. Police did not confirm that account.\n\nOfficers swarmed the scene. Funeral attendees angry at the shooting swore and scuffled with officers and one officer was slightly injured, police said.\n\n\u201cI feel disrespected by the cops for doing that, for taking another life from us today while we\u2019re mourning a life that\u2019s been lost already,\u201d attendee David Sandoval said standing near where the shooting happened.\n\nJesse Paul: 303-954-1733, jpaul@denverpost.com or twitter.com/jesseapaul\n\nStaff reporter Noelle Phillips contributed to this story.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Two unrelated Denver police shootings leave two suspects dead", "title": "Two unrelated Denver police shootings leave two suspects dead", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/07/02/two-unrelated-denver-police-shootings-leave-two-suspects-dead/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140702__overland-park-officer-involved-shootingp1-1.jpg", "height": 450}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140702__overland-park-officer-involved-shootingp1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-02T21:20:39+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T09:54:47+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cCertainly this isn\u2019t something we want to have happen,\u201d Denver police commander Matt Murray said at the scene of the second shooting.\nTwo suspects were killed in two unrelated officer-involved shootings \u2014 both in south Denver \u2014 on Wednesday afternoon.\nThe second shooting occurred at a funeral home on Tejon Street near West Elk Place.\nFuneral attendees angry at the shooting swore and scuffled with officers and one officer was slightly injured, police said.\nThe first shooting happened around 3 p.m. during an undercover drug operation in the parking lot at Overland Pond Park near South Platte River Drive and West Florida Avenue."}
