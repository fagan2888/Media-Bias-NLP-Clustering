Hooper talks with veteran Democratic strategists Steve Rosenthal of the Organizing Group and Center for American Progress Action Fund Executive Director Angela Kelley, who agree that Clinton's debate performance shot her back to front-runner status in the Democratic field.\n\n\u201cIf it looked to some insiders as if the Clinton campaign wasn\u2019t performing that well, if she came down a few pegs, there was a possibly a rationale for Biden to consider running,\" Rosenthal said.\n\nBut that's not what happened, he added, \"I think it would be really tough for Vice President Joe Biden to get in the race at this point.\"\n\nKelley notes that the country has watched Biden struggle to make a decision since his son Beau died, considering the personal toll that a presidential campaign would have on his family.\n\n\"If he was waiting, though, to see what happened, going into this debate: Was Secretary Clinton a formidable opponent? Was Secretary Clinton ready but not rehearsed?
