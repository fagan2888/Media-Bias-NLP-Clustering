Students were hooked up to machines and told their brainwaves would be measured throughout the night \u2013 and the next day were shown spreadsheets containing the \u201cdense\u201d and detailed results.\n\nOne group was told their REM sleep was above average, making them more mentally alert \u2013 while the second group was told their sleep fell below par. All were given a brief lesson on the importance of sleep quality and how it impacts reasoning, judgment and other mental processes.\n\nThey were then given real tests to assess their listening and processing skills \u2013 and those who believed they got a good night\u2019s sleep performed far better on the tests, compared to those in the poorer performing group.\n\nEric Horowitz at the blog Peer-Reviewed by My Neurons explains it this way: \u201cDraganich and Erdal found that participants who were told they had below average sleep quality performed significantly worse on the [tests they were given]\u2026. In addition, the performance of participants on a verbal fluency test called the COWAT [controlled oral word association test] showed that not only does telling people they had below average sleep quality lead to inferior performance, telling them they had above average sleep can lead to superior performance.\u201d\n\nRelated: 10 Ways Sleep Is Now Big Business\n\n\u201cGiven the global importance of getting a good night\u2019s rest, the idea of placebo sleep seems potentially far reaching,\u201d adds Horowitz, a social science writer and education researcher.\n\nHotel maids who were told their work was \u201cgood exercise\u201d in a separate study scored higher than a control group on a range of health indicators, Horowitz reports. \u201cAnother study found that when participants were told athletes had excellent vision, they demonstrated better vision when doing a more-athletic activity relative to a less-athletic activity. Many studies have also shown that placebo caffeine can have an impact.\u201d\n\nMuch more study and analysis is needed to assess whether the placebo effect holds true for sleep and for a whole range of life activities and situations. If you tell someone he\u2019s the smartest person in the room, does that make him unleash his inner brilliance? If you tell me I\u2019m thin \u2013 and I believe you \u2013 does that actually make me thin? How far does the placebo effect go? How far can it?\n\nSay sleep researchers Draganich and Erdal, \u201c[Our] findings supported the hypothesis that mindset can influence cognitive states in both positive and negative directions, suggesting a means of controlling one\u2019s health and cognition.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "There is no question that getting a good night\u2019s sleep help keeps us healthy, mentally", "title": "The Power of Positive Sleep Persuasion", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/01/24/Power-Positive-Sleep-Persuasion", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/06282013_Sleeping_Woman_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/01/24/Power-Positive-Sleep-Persuasion", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/06282013_Sleeping_Woman_article.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@maurmack"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "There is no question that getting a good night\u2019s sleep help keeps us healthy, mentally", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd83b1\"", "article_summary": "But if you tell people that they got a better night\u2019s sleep than they actually did \u2013 reminding them how important good sleep is for brain functioning \u2013 do their brains actually end up working better?\nThere is no question that getting a good night\u2019s sleep help keeps us healthy, mentally and physically \u2013 and that most of us need more sleep than we\u2019re currently getting in a 24/7 society.\nColorado College researcher Christina Draganich and Kristi Erdal, a psychology professor at the same college, enlisted 164 participants in a \u201cfake\u201d sleep study.\nOne group was told their REM sleep was above average, making them more mentally alert \u2013 while the second group was told their sleep fell below par.\nRelated: 6 Smart Ways to Pay Down Your Sleep DebtA new study from the Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory and Cognition suggests a placebo can have a positive effect on sleep."}
