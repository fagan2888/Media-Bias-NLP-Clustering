This is not what I would approve of in any way, shape or form,\u201d said Linda Bolsen, who added that she is afraid for the safety of her son, Shahid King Bolsen. \u201cFrom what I\u2019ve read in his articles, it scares me.\u201d\n\nShahid Bolsen, 43, who grew up in Boulder and took political science classes at Metropolitan State University before dropping out, has garnered a large social media following in the Middle East.\n\nAfter converting from Catholicism to Islam, Bolsen eventually became a vocal opponent of \u201cglobalization,\u201d blaming the West for policies that impoverish the Third World, according to his online writings.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear to what extent his messages may have triggered the recent bombings of mainly empty banks, stores and restaurants in Cairo, including six on Thursday, according to The New York Times. The attacks killed two and injured nine, including four police officers, an article in The Times said Saturday.\n\nBut the \u201cPopular Resistance Movement,\u201d which took credit for the bombings, uses slogans first popularized by Bolsen, according to a Friday article on the Hudson Institute website called \u201cAllah Versus KFC,\u201d co-written by Mokhtar Awad, a research associate for the Center for American Progress, and Samuel Tadros, a senior fellow at the Institute, a pro-business think tank founded in 1961 by Herman Kahn. Popular Resistance seeks to topple the military regime of Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, their article says.\n\n\u201cBolsen\u2019s influence stems from his innovative efforts to fuse early-twenty-first-century, anti-capitalist ideology with the tenets of ultra-conservative Salafi Islam,\u201d the article said.\n\nLinda Bolsen said her son was \u201cbasically a good kid. He was very curious. He had an awesome sense of humor.\u201d\n\nHe was born Shannon Morris.\n\n\u201cI know he researched a lot of different religions,\u201d his mother said. As he was growing up, he admired the life of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., she said. He originally became interested in Islam through Malcolm X, and joined the faith in 1997.\n\nAfter converting to Islam, he took on a new name: \u201cShahid\u201d is the Arabic word for \u201cmartyr,\u201d \u201cKing\u201d stands for Martin Luther King, and he took his mother\u2019s maiden name.\n\nBolsen met his wife, Asya Abdul-Hadi, 51, a Palestinian from Gaza, after she won a fellowship to work at the Rocky Mountain News. In 1996, she wrote an article in which she described her background, while criticizing how Western media sometimes mischaracterize Muslim women.\n\n\u201cI am a Muslim woman. Though I grew up in one of the Gaza Strip\u2019s densely populated refugee camps, I earned a bachelor\u2019s degree from an Islamic university. I\u2019ve been able to travel \u2014 alone \u2014 within the Middle East, Europe and now the U.S., have a thriving career and share decision-making with the men in my family and office,\u201d she wrote.\n\nStaffers at the News recall that Abdul-Hadi came to the Rocky in 1996 through the Alfred Friendly Fellowship program, which sought to tutor young Third World journalists on the ways of western media.\n\nThey remember Abdul-Hadi was a hardworking, smart reporter and that Bolsen \u2014 who worked in the circulation department \u2014 occasionally would show up in the newsroom to see his future wife. \u201cShe met Shahid while she was there, and they ultimately became a couple and had children,\u201d said John Ensslin, formerly of the News and now of the Bergen Record newspaper. Ensslin was the longtime coordinator of the fellowship program.\n\n\u201cI mostly remember Asya as a very smart and intelligent woman from Gaza, who had a keen sense of wit and was a really good journalist,\u201d Ensslin said.\n\nRob Reuteman worked as an editor at the Rocky for 26 years and said Bolsen made an impression.\n\n\u201cHe was a white guy, and he wore a white-knit skullcap all the time and Arab clothing,\u201d Reuteman said. \u201cBut he was not a reporter. I just saw him hanging out at her desk from time to time. He sort of stuck out in the newsroom because he was dressed like an Arab guy and nobody else was.\u201d\n\nThree years later, Bolsen took upon himself the role of defender of Muslim culture when he wrote an opinion piece that appeared in the News on July 2, 1999, headlined \u201cViolence Against Women is a Worldwide Problem.\u201d In response to an article about \u201chonor killing\u201d in the Middle East, Bolsen accused the reporter of \u201cdistortive imbalance\u201d and having an agenda to selectively indict Islam.\n\nBolsen later moved his family to the United Arab Emirates and opened up an Internet cafe. He ended up spending seven years in prison.\n\n\u201cI know nothing about his life over there,\u201d said Linda Bolsen, who also worked at the News, but not in the newsroom.\n\nA story in a UAE publication called The National said Shahid Bolsen was living in Sharjah when he killed German engineer Martin Steiner, whom he met online. Prosecutors said Bolsen had lured Steiner to his apartment on the false claim that he could have sex with Bolsen\u2019s maid.\n\nBolsen told officials he unsuccessfully attempted to persuade the engineer not to indulge in his \u201csinful desires,\u201d but when the drunken German attempted to sexually assault the maid, Bolsen said, he smothered him with a rag soaked in chloroform to subdue him. Instead of knocking him out, it killed the man, according to the publication.\n\nHe was caught after stuffing Steiner\u2019s body in a blue suitcase, dumping it in the desert and attempting to flee the country. Originally sentenced to death, his sentence was reduced to manslaughter and then was commuted in 2010 after he paid $55,000 in \u201cblood money.\u201d\n\nIn recent years, Bolsen has cemented himself as an opponent of Western commercialism.\n\n\u201cNo army ever takes a step except that it is following or followed by business,\u201d wrote Bolsen on his Facebook page accompanying an image of the silhouette of a soldier emblazoned with the logos of KFC, Starbucks and Coca-Cola.\n\nIn one article, Bolsen wrote that \u201ceconomic globalization has left most Third World governments with little more to do than carry out the edicts of Western powers.\u201d\n\nHe wrote another article called, \u201cWhen there is blood in the streets, see who is investing.\u201d\n\nLinda Bolsen said her son\u2019s message has been of nonviolence, but on Saturday she looked at a statement he wrote in which he called unintended deaths during the bombings of commercial properties \u201ccollateral damage.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is his life. I do not approve of anything outside of nonviolence,\u201d she said.\n\nKirk Mitchell: 303-954-1206, denverpost.com/coldcases or twitter.com/kirkmitchell\n\nPeter Dettmann of The Denver Post and Alex Burness of the Daily Camera contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Boulder native\u2019s online writing incites Egypt attacks", "title": "Boulder native\u2019s online writing incites Egypt attacks", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/02/28/boulder-natives-online-writing-incites-egypt-attacks/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150228__20150301_A2_CD01COTERRORISTJPICp1.jpg", "height": 530}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150228__20150301_A2_CD01COTERRORISTJPICp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-28T18:50:11+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T21:42:39+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc105\"", "article_summary": "After converting from Catholicism to Islam, Bolsen eventually became a vocal opponent of \u201cglobalization,\u201d blaming the West for policies that impoverish the Third World, according to his online writings.\nThis is not what I would approve of in any way, shape or form,\u201d said Linda Bolsen, who added that she is afraid for the safety of her son, Shahid King Bolsen.\nA story in a UAE publication called The National said Shahid Bolsen was living in Sharjah when he killed German engineer Martin Steiner, whom he met online.\nKirk Mitchell: 303-954-1206, denverpost.com/coldcases or twitter.com/kirkmitchellPeter Dettmann of The Denver Post and Alex Burness of the Daily Camera contributed to this report.\nThe attacks killed two and injured nine, including four police officers, an article in The Times said Saturday."}
