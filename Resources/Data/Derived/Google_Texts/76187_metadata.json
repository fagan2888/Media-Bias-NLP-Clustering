The architect of ObamaCare spent the intervening four years snickering at making suckers out of Americans, but won\u2019t appear on television to defend himself these days, and especially not on Sean Hannity\u2019s eponymous Fox News Channel show. Hannity sent David Webb out to find Gruber instead, with rather amusing results (via Katie Pavlich):\n\nWatch the latest video at video.foxnews.com\n\nWhy amusing? Well, it seems that Gruber talks a big game about everyone else being stupid, but won\u2019t put his beliefs into practice. If he\u2019s really that much smarter than the hoi polloi for which he has such unvarnished contempt, why not debate the great unwashed? Heck, Hannity usually gives his progressive opponents a pretty fair shake, too, much more so than conservatives get on other cable-news outlets (with the singular exception of Morning Joe on MSNBC). Gruber can even consult with Alan Colmes on that point.\n\nInstead of engaging the Grubes, as it were, Gruber runs away from David Webb with the obligatory \u201cno comment.\u201d For a super genius, Gruber seems singularly unwilling to put his superior intellect on the line here. \u201cPretty gutless,\u201d Hannity concludes, and Webb jokes, \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re on his Christmas card list.\u201d That\u2019s too bad, because thus far, Gruber\u2019s the gift that keeps on giving.\n\nChris Cillizza has a pretty good analysis of what\u2019s driving Gruberama among conservatives, and why this story will have legs despite a near-blackout in the news media:\n\nThe first point is somewhat obvious. Ever since then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), way back in March 2010, said, \u201cWe have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it,\u201d conservatives have been convinced that Democrats either (a) don\u2019t know what really was in the law or (b) more nefariously, Democrats knew exactly what was in the ACA and pushed it through Congress to keep the public from finding out. If you believe \u201cb\u201d \u2014 as does virtually every member of the Republican base \u2014 then you see Gruber\u2019s comments, made in a panel discussion in 2013, as the smoking gun that proves you were right all along. \u2026 The second point is slightly more subtle but, I think, even more responsible for why Gruber and his comments have conservatives seeing red. Nothing makes conservatives more angry than the belief, which they think is widespread among liberals, that they are stupid. That if only conservatives read as much as the left or had the intellectual capacity of the left, they would see things the way the left sees them.\n\nCillizza calls this \u201cconservative catnip.\u201d This display of contempt and arrogance should really be American catnip. Maybe if this got the coverage it deserves in the media, it might, which could be why most mainstream news outlets have stayed away from it. Kudos to Cillizza for reporting on it in the Washington Post.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "\u201cAre the American people really stupid?\u201d", "title": "Gruber on the run: Famed video commentator suddenly gets shy on camera", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/11/18/gruber-on-the-run-famed-video-commentator-suddenly-gets-shy-on-camera/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@EdMorrissey"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "keywords": "Barack Obama, Jonathan Gruber, ObamaCare, Sean Hannity,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-18T18:01:41+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-18T20:11:38+00:00"}, "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf723\"", "article_summary": "Hannity sent David Webb out to find Gruber instead, with rather amusing results (via Katie Pavlich):Watch the latest video at video.foxnews.comWhy amusing?\nWell, it seems that Gruber talks a big game about everyone else being stupid, but won\u2019t put his beliefs into practice.\nNothing makes conservatives more angry than the belief, which they think is widespread among liberals, that they are stupid.\n\u2026 The second point is slightly more subtle but, I think, even more responsible for why Gruber and his comments have conservatives seeing red.\nIf he\u2019s really that much smarter than the hoi polloi for which he has such unvarnished contempt, why not debate the great unwashed?"}
