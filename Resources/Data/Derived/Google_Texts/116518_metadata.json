American government has developed customs for resolving the divided government problem. In the best cases, the two parties try to compromise. In the worst cases, failure to compromise leads to stalemate.\n\nMuch of the press coverage still presents the disagreement in these terms. Jonathan Weisman reports in today\u2019s New York Times:\n\nFor three years, Congressional leaders have relied on tactical maneuvers, sleights of hand and sheer gimmickry to move the nation from one fiscal crisis to the next \u2014 with little strategy to deal with the actual problems at hand. Medicare and Social Security continue to swell with an aging population. Health care costs grow. A burdensome tax code remains unchanged, and economic revival is shadowed by the specter of Washington\u2019s crisis-driven mismanagement.\n\nActually, the budget deficit is falling like a rock:\n\nAnd health-care inflation is likewise falling much faster than expected:\n\nOne can make the argument that the long-term deficit picture still looks worrisome. But the long-term deficit is not \u201cthe problem at hand.\u201d The problem at hand is that current public policy is exerting a drag on the recovery, and the looming showdowns are threatening to administer more shocks to the system. The problem at hand, in other words, is that we can\u2019t even get to a stalemate.\n\nSince taking control of the House of Representatives in 2011, a coterie of Republicans has challenged this informal approach. Their belief is that the absence of cooperation should lead not to stalemate but to the president bending to their will. That assumption implies a delegitimization of the presidency that Obama has come to understand, belatedly, that he can\u2019t accept.\n\nThe Republican Establishment is trying to coax the crisis-mongers out of their fervor. Today The Wall Street Journal editorial page assails Republicans who insist on shutting down the government unless President Obama agrees to destroy his own health-care reform, a fantastical demand. \u201cKamikaze missions rarely turn out well, least of all for the pilots,\u201d the Journal warns.\n\nBut it\u2019s not as if the House leadership has a more reasonable proposal on offer. In fact, the position of the House leadership is far more radical. GOP leaders are promising their base that if they give up on the Obamacare shutdown fight, they can have an Obamacare debt-ceiling fight. House leaders are dangling before the baying hordes, reports Politico, \u201ctons of conservative goodies: construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, entitlement reform and principles for tax reform.\u201d You can have all this and more!\n\nBut of course conservatives aren\u2019t sure they can trust their leaders. Last spring, the leadership talked conservatives out of defaulting on the national debt by promising to precipitate a government shutdown in the fall. Now that fall is here, they\u2019re trying to avert the shutdown by dangling a debt default. That threat is actually more dangerous and less credible. As the Journal has argued previously, \u201cNever take a hostage you're not prepared to shoot.\u201d And Boehner is not prepared to shoot the hostage: He has admitted numerous times publicly, and reportedly in private as well, that he will not allow a debt default.\n\nThe tension between the two parties is higher now than ever before because they disagree not only on underlying policy but on the basic premises of shared governance. Obama recognizes that allowing debt-ceiling hostage crises to become enshrined would not only subject him to continuing extortion but set the system on course for an eventual default when, inevitably, ransom negotiations fail at the last minute. Establishment Republicans are trying to talk their base out of extreme measures without addressing their deeper belief that House Republicans are entitled to extract concessions from the president, via threat, without compromising at all.\n\nA source tells Jonathan Cohn that there is no negotiation between the two parties at all: \u201cThe breakdown is more extensive than you\u2019ve heard,\u201d this person told me. \u201cThere is no discussion going on at all at this point.\u201d When the two parties disagree about whether they should be holding a negotiation with mutual compromises or a process of extortion, there\u2019s nothing to negotiate over. Republicans and Democrats don\u2019t need to resolve their policy disputes to avert a fundamental crisis, but they do need to resolve the legitimacy crisis.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#000", "description": "The real cause of the Obamacare shutdown calamity.", "generator": "the-factory", "og": {"site_name": "Daily Intelligencer", "description": "The real cause of the Obamacare shutdown calamity.", "title": "Obama, Republicans, and the Crisis of Legitimacy", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2013/09/obama-republicans-and-the-crisis-of-legitimacy.html", "image": "http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2013/09/17/17-juan-peron.w1200.h630.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The real cause of the Obamacare shutdown calamity.", "creator": "@jonathanchait", "image": "http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2013/09/17/17-juan-peron.w750.h560.2x.jpg", "title": "Obama, Republicans, and the Crisis of Legitimacy", "site": "@intelligencer", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Daily Intelligencer", "fb": {"app_id": 120608177953522}, "msapplication-TileImage": "//cache.nymag.com/media/di/icon.144x144.png", "application-name": "Daily Intelligencer", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "the national interest, politics, barack obama, john boehner, debt ceiling hostage crisis", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NewYorkMag", "tag": "the national interest,politics,barack obama,john boehner,debt ceiling hostage crisis", "published_time": "2013-09-17T13:45:00.000Z", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/JonathanChaitPublic"}, "topics": "topics-test, the national interest, politics, barack obama, john boehner, debt ceiling hostage crisis", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3386\"", "article_summary": "Republicans and Democrats don\u2019t need to resolve their policy disputes to avert a fundamental crisis, but they do need to resolve the legitimacy crisis.\nThe incipient showdown in Washington is a form of this underlying tension \u2014 not a Latin American\u2013style coup, but very much a crisis of legitimacy.\nEstablishment Republicans are trying to talk their base out of extreme measures without addressing their deeper belief that House Republicans are entitled to extract concessions from the president, via threat, without compromising at all.\nSince taking control of the House of Representatives in 2011, a coterie of Republicans has challenged this informal approach.\nThat assumption implies a delegitimization of the presidency that Obama has come to understand, belatedly, that he can\u2019t accept."}
