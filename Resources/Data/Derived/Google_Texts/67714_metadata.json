Belle was a fast-living, hard-driving woman who became known as the \u201cBandit Queen.\u201d\n\n/ Download\n\nBELLE STARR\n\nFebruary 5, 1848\u2013February 3, 1889\n\nWhen Belle Starr was shot to death in 1889, a newspaper declared her to be \u201ca most desperate woman \u2026\u201d Her killer was never identified. Many suspected her son, whom Belle had recently beaten for mistreating her horse. Her unsolved murder was a fitting end to a life that was a whirlwind of violence, crime and legend.\n\nShe was born Myra Maybelle Shirley in 1848 and at the age of 16, moved to the north Texas town of Scyene. She kept company with notorious criminals including Jesse James. She married three times to three different outlaws and even spent time in prison for stealing horses.\n\nThough she was ruthless to her enemies, she had a great capacity to make friends and she even mingled with the Dallas elite during the brief periods when her gunfights and thievery gave way to respectable living.\n\nBut it was only after her death, at age forty, that her legend grew. The National Police Gazette invented new stories about her and her embellished reputation continued to inspired popular novels and western films, long after her death.\n\nStories circulated depicting Belle as an elegantly dressed woman riding a black mare in a feathered black Sombrero and toting a Colt 45 pistol that she called \u201cmy baby.\u201d\n\nInstead of being remembered as a desperate criminal, she became a romantic symbol of the disappearing American West, known as: \u201cBelle Starr, the Bandit Queen.\u201d\n\nFt.Smith National Historic Park photos\n\nSelected Bibliography\n\nFox, Richard K.
