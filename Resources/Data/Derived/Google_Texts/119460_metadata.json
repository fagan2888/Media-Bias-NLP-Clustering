Within two years, Great Britain had routed China and, during the subsequent peace treaty, extracted significant concessions: control of Hong Kong (in perpetuity), the widening of trade in new ports, and extraterritoriality for British subjects in China\u2014a privilege obtained by American and French governments soon afterwards.\n\nSince then, the \u201ccentury of humiliation\u201d has been a central part of the P.R.C.'s founding mythology, of which the short version is this: Long the world's pre-eminent civilization, China fell behind the superior technology of the West over the centuries, an imbalance that finally came to a head with the loss in the Opium Wars. This begun the most tumultuous century in the country's\u2014or any country's\u2014history, one that featured an incessant series of wars, occupations, and revolutions and one that did not end until the victory of the Communist Party in China's 1945-49 civil war.\n\nSince history is written by its winners, China's \u201ccentury of humiliation\u201d is self-serving to the Chinese Communist Party, and the country's troubles did not end in 1949. But the narrative of \u201chumiliation\u201d is not entirely a Chinese creation. In fact, in an episode recounted by Orville Schell and John Delury in their wonderful book Wealth and Power, during the Second Opium War in 1860 the British army set out to humiliate the Chinese by attacking Beijing's Summer Palace. Located in a northwest corner of the capital, the Summer Palace (known as Yuanmingyuan in Chinese) was an exquisite array of buildings, lakes, and parks, and served as the primary residence of the imperial court. In the Opium War, it had no military significance. But following the Chinese murder of several dozen British and French troops in an ill-conceived hostage crisis, the British took revenge by targeting the Summer Palace. Schell and Delury write:\n\nThe destruction of Yuanmingyuan was to be a \u201csolemn act of retribution,\u201dsaid the British commander Lord Elgin, in which no blood would be spilled, but an emperor's \u201cpride as well as his feelings,\u201d would be crushed. Indeed, before the foreign expeditionary force arrived in Beijing, the young emperor Xianfeng had already fled along with his concubine (soon to be known as the Empress Dowager Cixi) to safe haven in Manchuria. With the Son of Heaven in hiding far to the north in his hunting lodge, British and French soldiers set about teaching the Qing [Dynasty] a lesson they would never forget: that the British crown would not tolerate having the rights of Englishmen violated, even in faraway china. \u201cAs a deliberate act of humiliation,\u201d historian James Hevia explains, \u201cit was an object lesson for others who might contemplate defying British power.\u201d\n\nThe systematic plunder of the palaces, which contained an enormous amount of priceless artifacts, lasted well into 1860. When it was finished, the men immediately understood they had secured a psychological victory over the Chinese:\n\n\u201cThe great vulnerable point in a Mandarin's character lies in his pride,\u201d [Lieutenant Colonel G.J. Wolsely, part of the British expeditionary force] observed. \u201cThe destruction of the Yuanmingyuan was the most crushing of all blows which could be leveled at his Majesty's inflated notions of universal supremacy.\u201d Reducing the gardens to ruins was \u201cthe strongest proof of our superior strength\u201d and \u201cserved to undeceive all Chinamen in their absurd conviction of their monarch's universal sovereignty.\u201d\n\nToday, a century and a half later, the Communist Party continues to preserve the ruined state of the Summer Palace as a reminder of the British plunder.\n\nThe history of war is full of many examples of where one side attacked a strategically insignificant installation in order to score a psychological victory over an opponent. But Schell and Delury's account of the destruction of the Summer Palace encapsulates just how large a role humiliation played in the last two centuries of Chinese history, and how his role in ending this humiliation forever colored Chinese impressions of Mao Zedong.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The British destruction of Beijing&#39;s Summer Palace in the 19th Century encapsulates how the emotion played a major role in forming modern China.", "author": "Matt Schiavenza", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "The British destruction of Beijing&#39;s Summer Palace in the 19th Century encapsulates how the emotion played a major role in forming modern China.", "title": "How Humiliation Drove Modern Chinese History", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2013/10/summerpalace/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/china/archive/2013/10/How-Humiliation-Drove-Modern-Chinese-History/280878/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe226a\"", "article_summary": "But Schell and Delury's account of the destruction of the Summer Palace encapsulates just how large a role humiliation played in the last two centuries of Chinese history, and how his role in ending this humiliation forever colored Chinese impressions of Mao Zedong.\nSince history is written by its winners, China's \u201ccentury of humiliation\u201d is self-serving to the Chinese Communist Party, and the country's troubles did not end in 1949.\nBut following the Chinese murder of several dozen British and French troops in an ill-conceived hostage crisis, the British took revenge by targeting the Summer Palace.\nSince then, the \u201ccentury of humiliation\u201d has been a central part of the P.R.C.\nIn the Opium War, it had no military significance."}
