Forensic experts say detailed examination of bodies would be vital in detecting evidence of any attack.\n\nIn harsh conditions such as the Sinai peninsula where the Airbus A321 broke up and fell, evidence can be fragile and end up scattered well beyond the main crash site.\n\nIn the UTA disaster, a team including 60 soldiers faced a 50-mile trail of tiny fragments, 10 times the size of the main wreckage field, according to an official French report.\n\nThey also had to cope with desert winds and move quickly to make sure vital evidence was found. Their breakthrough came when soldiers combing through 60 square km of Sahara found parts containing traces of explosion.\n\nAs with the recent Dutch probe into the downing of a Malaysian jet over Ukraine, investigators may reconstruct the recovered debris on a specially constructed frame.\n\nThat can help pinpoint an explosion's source by examining the impact of shockwaves and debris on the fuselage. Engines may be examined for shrapnel and even paint smears if a suspected blast is thought to have happened near the front of the plane.\n\nDoubts meanwhile remain over what evidence the black boxes will supply. Egyptian officials said the voice recorder was damaged and previous disasters suggest the separate flight data recorder would have seen its power cut and produced little of value.\n\nBut science may help fill in some of the blanks.\n\nOn the UTA jetliner, as well as a TWA jet whose fuel tank blew up over the Atlantic in 1996, cockpit tapes ended immediately after the blast but still yielded vital clues thanks to a procedure called \"spectrum analysis\".\n\nScientists use such methods to examine the signature of any sounds picked up in the last microseconds of normal flight.\n\nThat helped investigators of the UTA disaster to identify a revealing sound: not of the blast itself but of the airframe transmitting shockwaves like a tuning fork.\n\nInvestigators may be able to compare any usable fragment of audio to the frequencies produced by those previous explosions to try to assess whether they are looking at evidence of a bomb.\n\n(Reporting by Tim Hepher; Editing by Giles Elgood)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "DUBAI (Reuters) - With world powers divided over the cause of a Russian jetliner crash", "title": "Crash forensics to determine whether bomb downed Russian jet", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/11/06/Crash-forensics-determine-whether-bomb-downed-Russian-jet", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/egypt-crash_5.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/11/06/Crash-forensics-determine-whether-bomb-downed-Russian-jet", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/egypt-crash_5.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "DUBAI (Reuters) - With world powers divided over the cause of a Russian jetliner crash", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3055\"", "article_summary": "They also had to cope with desert winds and move quickly to make sure vital evidence was found.\nBritain said on Thursday it believed Islamic State may have downed the jet, but Egypt said there was no evidence of a bomb and Russia said it was too early to draw conclusions.\nIn December 1988, 270 people were killed when a bomb brought down Pan Am flight 103 over the Scottish town of Lockerbie.\nScientists use such methods to examine the signature of any sounds picked up in the last microseconds of normal flight.\nForensic experts say detailed examination of bodies would be vital in detecting evidence of any attack."}
