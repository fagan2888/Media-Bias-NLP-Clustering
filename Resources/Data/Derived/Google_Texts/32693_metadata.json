Even as Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans have at\u00adtacked Demo\u00adcrats on the bill, Demo\u00adcrats haven\u2019t seen fit to fight back \u2014 pre\u00adfer\u00adring to change the sub\u00adject,\u201d The Wash\u00ading\u00adton Post\u2018s Chris Cil\u00adlizza wrote at the time.\n\nRep. Jim Costa, D-Cal\u00adif., who barely hung onto his seat that year, voted for the Af\u00adford\u00adable Care Act, but later said he would have pre\u00adferred a more \u201cin\u00adcre\u00adment\u00adal\u201d ap\u00adproach to health care re\u00adform. Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., made a full flip-flop, go\u00ading from \u201cI\u2019d be for it\u201d to \u201cI would not have sup\u00adpor\u00adted that.\u201d Mean\u00adwhile, Blue Dogs like former Rep. Heath Shuler, D-N.C., touted their vote against the law and hoped it would in\u00adsu\u00adlate them from party back\u00adlash.\n\nSpoil\u00ader alert: It didn\u2019t work. Demo\u00adcrats lost 63 seats and the Blue Dogs were nearly wiped out.\n\nNow, some Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans are fa\u00adcing the in\u00adverse prob\u00adlem. While the more ideo\u00adlo\u00adgic\u00adal wing of the party forced a con\u00adfront\u00ada\u00adtion over Obama\u00adcare that led to the first gov\u00adern\u00adment shut\u00addown in 17 years, GOP can\u00addid\u00adates in more com\u00adpet\u00adit\u00adive dis\u00adtricts want noth\u00ading to do with it, even as they feel pres\u00adsured from the right to avoid dis\u00adown\u00ading the Ted Cruz wing all to\u00adgeth\u00ader. So they\u2019re opt\u00ading for a duck-and-cov\u00ader ap\u00adproach in\u00adstead.\n\nIt\u2019s hap\u00adpen\u00ading in south\u00adern Ari\u00adzona, where Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan can\u00addid\u00adate Martha Mc\u00adSally \u201cwouldn\u2019t take a stand [on the shut\u00addown] des\u00adpite mul\u00adtiple re\u00adquests for her po\u00ads\u00adi\u00adtion from The Re\u00adpub\u00adlic, Ari\u00adzona Daily Star, Green Val\u00adley News/Sahuar\u00adita Sun and KVOI-AM (1030),\u201d as the Ari\u00adzona Re\u00adpub\u00adlic re\u00adpor\u00adted this month. \u201cShe would say only that the shut\u00addown is \u2018a fail\u00adure of lead\u00ader\u00adship,\u2019 \u201d the pa\u00adper\u2019s Re\u00adbekah Sanders ad\u00added.\n\nIn New Hamp\u00adshire\u2019s 1st Dis\u00adtrict, Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan Dan In\u00adnis, who is primary\u00ading two-term Rep. Frank Guinta, wouldn\u2019t say if he would have sup\u00adpor\u00adted the GOP\u2019s ef\u00adfort to de\u00adfund Obama\u00adcare by link\u00ading it to a gov\u00adern\u00adment shut\u00addown fight. \u201cObama\u00adcare is a dis\u00adastrous, big-gov\u00adern\u00adment takeover of the health care sys\u00adtem. While I sup\u00adport re\u00adpeal\u00ading Obama\u00adcare, I think we\u2019ve got to be real\u00adist\u00adic,\u201d he told the AP.\n\nIn up\u00adstate New York, Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan con\u00adgres\u00adsion\u00adal can\u00addid\u00adate Elise Stefanik used her first policy state\u00adment of the cam\u00adpaign to cri\u00adti\u00adcize in\u00adcum\u00adbent Demo\u00adcrat\u00adic Rep.
