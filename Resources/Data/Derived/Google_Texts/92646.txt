Greta Van Susteren says she got a ‘dirty’ call from the Obama administration pressuring Fox News to lay off Benghazi story

Greta Van Susteren claimed on Fox News Friday that the Obama administration pressured her to force one of her colleagues to drop a story on the 2012 Benghazi, Libya, attack that killed four Americans, an event that Fox has aggressively covered since its occurrence.

“When reporter Jennifer Griffin said she was told that there was a stand down order at Benghazi, I got a weird call from the Obama administration trying to pressure me to get Jennifer to back down on her report,” Van Susteren recalled. “I thought the call from the Obama administration was dirty. Incidentally, I don’t control my colleagues and they don’t control me.”

Moreover, the Fox News host spotlighted the fact that Fox reporters have repeatedly been left out of media briefings by the administration — once by the State Department and a second time by the CIA — on the Benghazi attack.

“I think Fox News is being punished for aggressively asking questions, doing our jobs,” Van Susteren speculated.

She likened the attempts of Fox News reporters to get information from the Obama administration on Benghazi to “pulling teeth.”

“The Obama administration’s behavior post-Benghazi has been weird, like they’re hiding something,” explained Van Susteren.”First, that silly story about that video. Remember [National Security Adviser] Susan Rice on all the Sunday talk shows? And even President Obama kept talking about the video for weeks.”

The video to which she referred is the Internet video that, according e-mails obtained by Judicial Watch, the Obama administration made the focal point of Rice’s Sunday show talking points following the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi.

“Are you suspicious?” Van Susteren concluded in her “Off the Record” segment. “I don’t know about you, but I wasn’t born yesterday.”
