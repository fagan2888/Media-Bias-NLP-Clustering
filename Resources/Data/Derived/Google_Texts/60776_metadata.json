World leaders and veterans gathered by the beaches of Normandy under clear blue skies on Friday to mark the 70th anniversary of World War Two's D-Day landings, with host France hoping the event will help bring a thaw in the Ukraine crisis. REUTERS/Pascal Rossignol (FRANCE - Tags: POLITICS ANNIVERSARY CONFLICT) - RTR3SHVB\n\n4222522\n\nDr. Cornel West is a leading liberal public intellectual. He gave an interview to NewsOne immediately following the 2012 Election that was nothing if not provocative. Dr. West said he was happy Romney didn\u2019t win, but far from satisfied with the Obama record and especially with the just-ended presidential campaign:\n\nSo we end up with such a narrow, truncated political discourse, as the major problems\u2014ecological catastrophe, climate change, global warming. So it\u2019s very sad. I mean, I\u2019m glad there was not a right-wing takeover, but we end up with a Republican, a Rockefeller Republican in blackface, with Barack Obama, so that our struggle with regard to poverty intensifies.\n\nSay that again? If one of my conservative colleagues had dared to say anything remotely like that, he (or she) would have been charged with racism of the worst sort. Still, it is worth considering the merits of Cornel West\u2019s argument.\n\nHas President Obama really been so disappointing from a genuinely left-wing perspective? I suggest he has not. Nor has he been \u201cincompetent,\u201d as so many of my conservative colleagues are charging. Most recently, some have raised the bar (or, perhaps, lowered it) by claiming that President Obama\u2019s administration is one of \u201cepic incompetence.\u201d\n\nPresident Obama has seemingly floated above these charges, these criticisms left and right. He marches to the beat of a different drummer.\n\nHe shrugged off sharp criticism from the Clinton camp in 2008. Recall he raised the hackles of Bill and Hillary then by saying Ronald Reagan was a \u201ctransformational\u201d president in a way that Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton were not. The Clintons were enraged. But candidate Obama was exactly right. He was giving the Gipper a left-handed compliment, to be sure. He granted that Reagan had transformed American politics \u2014 but in no way that he, Obama, would approve of.\n\nIn fact, the Clintons and most of the establishment media missed the real point of Mr. Obama\u2019s statement: He was promising liberal activists that he would be the kind of transformational president for the left that Reagan was for conservatives.\n\nAnd so he has been. His administration began by exercising control over the banks, insurance companies, and major automakers. All this was done in the name of pulling the country out of its economic nosedive. Mr. Obama\u2019s Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers reassured worried corporate leaders that the administration was not going to nationalize everything, but only \u201cthe commanding heights of the economy.\u201d\n\nAustin Goolsbee seemed blissfully unaware of the Marxian roots of that expression and that tactic. Apparently, it is getting harder to distinguish between classic Marxism and liberal thought in our Ivy League faculty lounges.\n\nAfter passing a huge, $787 billion stimulus bill that failed to stimulate, Mr. Obama spent the next year driving through the takeover of 1/6 of the U.S. economy. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act has been going through the throes of \u201cimplementation\u201d ever since.\n\nMillions of Americans feel like they\u2019ve been put on the rack. It is torture. Most of the media coverage has focused on the \u201cbotched\u201d rollout of the www.healthcare.gov website. But the \u201cpatient protection\u201d part of the 2,000-page opus is also obviously false. Millions who had health coverage have lost it. The \u201caffordable care\u201d part is likewise clearly false. For millions, the doctors they liked and the plans they could afford are suddenly out of reach.\n\nFrom a political science perspective, however, that part of the Obama plan least commented upon is the last word in its title: Act. It is not an Act of Congress, at all.\n\nWhat passes for Obamacare today is not the bill that was rammed through both houses of Congress\u2014using Nancy Pelosi\u2019s and Harry Reid\u2019s most questionable tactics. It is not the measure signed with great fanfare by President Obama in an East Room ceremony on March 23, 2010. (Yes, that was the august ceremony that Court Jester Joe Biden told us was a \u201cbig f___ing deal!)\n\nObamacare today is not even the challenged law that was adjudicated and narrowly upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court on June 28, 2012. That was a dog\u2019s breakfast of a ruling, but even that is not the main point.\n\nObamacare as it is today is vastly different. It is an ongoing process. It is an administrative amoeba, constantly changing, growing, transforming itself \u2014 and us. We no longer have laws, we have mandates.\n\nThere have been no fewer than 41 major changes to Obamacare since its initial passage. It is impossible to say today what Obamacare will mandate tomorrow. But President Obama will nonetheless make tomorrow\u2019s changes mandatory.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Ken Blackwell", "description": "Take heart, Cornel West, the president is a man of action", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Dr. Cornel West is a leading liberal public intellectual.
