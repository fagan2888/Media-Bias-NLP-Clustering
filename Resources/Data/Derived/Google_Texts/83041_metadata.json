He\u2019s planning to make a decision by the end of the week.\u201d\n\nJackson, 30, is a middle linebacker who started the previous eight seasons with the Cleveland Browns. Released last week to avoid a $4 million roster bonus, Jackson became immediately in demand. He visited the Tennessee Titans and his former defensive coordinator Roy Horton on Saturday.\n\nHe visited the Broncos and quarterback Peyton Manning, coach John Fox, defensive coordinator Jack Del Rio and general manager John Elway among others at the team\u2019s Dove Valley headquarters on Monday.\n\nJackson flew on Monday evening to Miami where he will meet Tuesday with the Dolphins, and has one more visit scheduled with an unnamed team.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t necessarily a bad sign the Broncos couldn\u2019t close the deal with Jackson on Monday.
