The area now is part of the 14th District that stretches into Tampa and is represented by Democrat Kathy Castor.\n\nIn its order July 9, the court told the Legislature to redraw eight congressional districts, noting specifically that the 14th District may not cross Tampa Bay \u2014 presumably leaving it for the 13th District. The court said the St. Petersburg area added more Democratic voters to the 14th, which already is a Democratic district, while ensuring that the 13th remained safely Republican.\n\nDemocrats make up more than 60 percent of the 67,000 voters in the St. Petersburg portion of the 14th District.\n\nState Rep. Dwight Dudley, a St. Petersburg Democrat whose District 68 includes downtown St. Petersburg, said he is ready to jump in.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the opportunity to do more, to serve on a larger stage. There\u2019s no shortage of work to be done.\u201d\n\nDudley said moving the 14th District area to the 13th District makes sense.\n\n\u201cWhat it does is it allows people with the greatest interest in that place the best representation,\u201d he said. \u201cAll these areas have unique features.\u201d\n\nHe said the court\u2019s ruling did not surprise him and was necessary to correct the political gerrymandering.\n\n\u201cI was saying my prayers and hoping that would happen,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s crooked, it\u2019s wrong, it\u2019s undemocratic.\u201d\n\nIn addition to Dudley, Eric Lynn, a former Pentagon official in the Obama administration, already has filed to run in the 13th District, and former Tampa City Councilwoman Mary Mulhern has said she plans to run, too.\n\nPinellas County Commissioner Ken Welch, who lives in the district, and former Gov. Charlie Crist, who lives in downtown St. Petersburg, also have been mentioned as potential candidates.\n\nSt. Petersburg City Councilwoman Darden Rice considered running, then changed her mind \u2014 but that was before the court-ordered redistricting, and she did not rule it out completely.\n\n\u201cIt clearly makes it a seat where a Democrat would be favored,\u201d said St. Petersburg Councilman Karl Nurse, also a Democrat. \u201cSo I think that means a half-dozen office holders are taking a look at it \u2014 not including me.\u201d\n\nHowever, Nurse said he might be interested in the county commission if Welch were to run for Congress.\n\n\u2756 \u2756 \u2756\n\nNurse, like several others, said Crist would be the biggest factor and likely could take the seat if he chooses to run.\n\nThe 14th District\u2019s St. Petersburg area is a mix of upscale, downtown waterfront condominiums; quiet, tree-lined streets with 1940s-era homes; some of the city\u2019s poorest neighborhoods just south of downtown; and the diverse Skyway Marina district and neighborhoods at the southeastern tip of the county.\n\nRedrawing the district wouldn\u2019t change much in those areas, said Jeff Cope\u00adland, director of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and a south St. Petersburg activist.\n\n\u201cWe have Kathy Castor already,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only people affected are the Republicans. Of course, they lose in the deal.\u201d\n\nBut the switch would be a significant shift in the rest of the 13th District, which Republicans have controlled for 42 years under Young and for the past year and a half with Jolly.\n\nDudley said issues such as the Affordable Care Act, voting rights and even the redistricting process itself would be prominent.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing we have to do is we have to change the process of allowing legislators to pick voters. We need to allow voters to pick legislators,\u201d he said. \u201cLegislators are the wrong people to redistrict.\u201d\n\n\u2756 \u2756 \u2756\n\nIn its ruling, the Supreme Court said the district lines drawn by the Republican-controlled legislature were gerrymandered to increase the chances for Republican candidates and are unconstitutional. The districts have undergone a series of legal challenges since they were adopted by the Legislature in 2012. Another lawsuit challenging the state Senate district maps is ongoing.\n\nStill, political analyst Darryl Paulson, a University of South Florida professor, said the new district wouldn\u2019t guarantee a Democrat wins, no matter what the voter registration numbers are.\n\n\u201cCertainly, you have a better opportunity. But there are other Republicans who have done well there \u2014 Rick Baker,\u201d he said, referring to the past mayor of St. Petersburg, who also has been mentioned as a possible candidate for the seat.\n\nHe said that historically Pinellas and Florida voters often have voted outside of their own party. For instance, since 1988, what is now the 13th District (it previously was the 6th, 8th and 10th District) has supported a Republican president only once, in 2004, despite having more registered Republicans.\n\nIn practical terms, Paulson said no candidate would have the clout Young had during four decades in office, including many years on the House Appropriations Committee. He secured billions of dollars for roads, defense industry contracts, high-tech jobs, beach restoration and other projects for Pinellas and for the state.\n\n\u201cIt would be unwise to assume anyone, whether Republican or Democrat, would be as successful,\u201d Paulson said.\n\nRather, the more competitive the district becomes, the more inclined candidates will be to find a safer and more politically central position.\n\n\u201cYoung never faced any serious competition. He was pretty free to do what he wanted to do or what he thought was in the best interest of his constituents,\u201d Paulson said.\n\nPaulson, meanwhile, criticized the court\u2019s ruling, which he said undermines the original goal in the 1990s ordered by the Justice Department, to draw districts where blacks and Hispanics could get elected.\n\n\u201cThe rationale being that blacks held their last congressional seat in 1880. Clearly there was discrimination at play,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2756 \u2756 \u2756\n\nPaulson said the 5th Congressional District, represented by Corrine Brown, which snakes from Jacksonville to Gainesville and to Orlando, was drawn intentionally to make it possible for a black candidate to win. Paulson said the court\u2019s order to redraw the district to extend west from Jacksonville toward Tallahassee would make it nearly impossible for a black candidate to win and was rejected by a federal judge in 1992 for that reason.\n\n\u201cNow they\u2019re saying it was racial gerrymandering and unconstitutional,\u201d he said. \u201cThat, to me, is beyond rationality.\u201d\n\nsgirardi@tampatrib.com", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sun, 19 Jul 2015 21:08:48 -0400", "Description": "ST.
