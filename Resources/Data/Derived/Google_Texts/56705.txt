Dunkin' Donuts signed a development agreement with OKD Holdings to open 13 new restaurants throughout the Oklahoma City area.

Misha Goli is a second generation Dunkin' Donuts franchisee with four restaurants throughout Oklahoma City. Goli and his team will manage and oversee operations at each new restaurant.

"We are excited to continue to expand Dunkin' Donuts' presence throughout Oklahoma City and play an important role in the daily lives of people who live, work and visit here," said Goli. "We have a passion and loyalty for the brand and look forward to the opening of our Dunkin' Donuts restaurants in the years to come."

The first of the 13 restaurants will open in 2015.

Dunkin' Donuts has close to 11,000 restaurants in 33 countries. The company offers a variety of design options and real estate formats for franchisees to personalize their restaurants. New franchise opportunities are available outside the metro and in the Tulsa area.

"Our secret to success is our passionate franchisees who provide a high-level of customer service to our guests every day," said Grant Benson, CFE, vice president of global franchising and business development, Dunkin' Brands. "We believe these existing franchise partners will become an important part of the local communities they serve."
