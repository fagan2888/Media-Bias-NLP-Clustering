Keira Knightley, Julianne Moore, Steve Carell, Amy Adams and David Beckham are among the stars expected to walk the red carpet on a chilly London winter day.\n\n\u201cThe Grand Budapest Hotel,\u201d Wes Anderson\u2019s candy-colored comedy about a chaotic central European hostelry, leads the race with 11 nominations, including best picture and best director.\n\n\u201cThe Theory of Everything,\u201d directed by James Marsh, and Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu\u2019s showbiz satire \u201cBirdman\u201d each have 10 nominations, while Morten Tyldum\u2019s \u201cThe Imitation Game\u201d has nine. \u201cBoyhood\u201d and Damien Chazelle\u2019s drumming drama \u201cWhiplash\u201d have with five nominations apiece.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Redmayne, \u2018Boyhood\u2019 tipped for wins at UK Academy Awards", "title": "Redmayne, \u2018Boyhood\u2019 tipped for wins at UK Academy Awards", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Redmayne, \u2018Boyhood\u2019 tipped for wins at UK Academy Awards", "title": "Redmayne, \u2018Boyhood\u2019 tipped for wins at UK Academy Awards", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/02/08/redmayne_boyhood_tipped_for_wins_at_uk_academy_awards/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/02/britain-bafta-2015-nominees-party.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Redmayne, \u2018Boyhood\u2019 tipped for wins at UK Academy Awards", "title": "Redmayne, \u2018Boyhood\u2019 tipped for wins at UK Academy Awards", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/02/britain-bafta-2015-nominees-party.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Jill Lawless", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca966\"", "article_summary": "The British stars are both best-actor nominees for playing real-life scientific heroes.\nThe awards ceremony at London\u2019s ornate Royal Opera House is British cinema\u2019s glitziest event and an increasingly important stop for Hollywood awards hopefuls.\n\u201cBoyhood\u201d and Damien Chazelle\u2019s drumming drama \u201cWhiplash\u201d have with five nominations apiece.\n\u201cThe Theory of Everything,\u201d directed by James Marsh, and Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu\u2019s showbiz satire \u201cBirdman\u201d each have 10 nominations, while Morten Tyldum\u2019s \u201cThe Imitation Game\u201d has nine.\nRedmayne stars as cosmos-probing physicist Stephen Hawking in \u201cThe Theory of Everything,\u201d and Cumberbatch plays code-cracking mathematician Alan Turing in \u201cThe Imitation Game.\u201dRedmayne beat Cumberbatch to a Golden Globe last month, and the pair will face off again at Hollywood\u2019s Academy Awards on Feb. 22."}
