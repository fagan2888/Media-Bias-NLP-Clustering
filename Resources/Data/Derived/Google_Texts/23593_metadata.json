Now, they\u2019re accusing Abby Pell.\n\nThe Daily Mirror reported Pell, 33, posted pictures of her ab muscles to Instagram with the caption, \u201cI\u2019ve got a kid, a six pack and no excuse.\u201d As was the case with Kang, people accused Pell of fat shaming \u201cpure and simple.\u201d Another comment read, \u201cExploiting your motherhood to show off is despicable and shameless.\u201d Presumably this was in response to the pictures Pell poses with her daughter Bella.\n\nIn fact, Bella is who inspired Pell to include her caption after saying she looked like Wonder Woman.\n\n\u201cI never meant to offend anyone \u2014 my life is better now that I\u2019m in shape, so I hoped I could encourage others to do the same,\u201d Pell said.\n\nAfter Bella was born, Pell struggled to lose the 50 pounds she gained during her pregnancy. She tried a handful of diets, including Atkins and The South Diet, but they never helped her curb cravings and feel satisfied with her meals. This final go-round, she adjusted her diet and fitness routine, focusing on lifting weights. This is when she started to see results.\n\n\"Now going to the gym is where I have my 'me-time,' which all mums know they need.\"\n\nTo see Pell's original pictures, click here.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "no, flex, zone, mom, shows, ab, muscles, others, accuse, her, fat, shaming", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Abby Pell, 33, was trying to inspire other moms to get in shape when she captioned a photo of her ab muscles, \"I have a kid, six pack, and no excuse.\" Unfortunately, not everyone took it that way.", "title": "Are 'No-Excuse' Moms Fat Shaming?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/no-flex-zone-mom-shows-ab-muscles-others-accuse-her-fat-shaming-318260", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2015/01/16/ab-muscles.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Abby Pell, 33, was trying to inspire other moms to get in shape when she captioned a photo of her ab muscles, \"I have a kid, six pack, and no excuse.\" Unfortunately, not everyone took it that way.", "title": "Are 'No-Excuse' Moms Fat Shaming?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/no-flex-zone-mom-shows-ab-muscles-others-accuse-her-fat-shaming-318260", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2015/01/16/ab-muscles.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/01/16/ab-muscles.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-01-16T17:26:56-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-16T17:26:55-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Abby Pell, 33, was trying to inspire other moms to get in shape when she captioned a photo of her ab muscles, \"I have a kid, six pack, and no excuse.\" Unfortunately, not everyone took it that way."}, "article_summary": "Fit mom Maria Kang was accused of fat shaming when she posted a picture of her impressive, post-pregnancy ab muscles with the caption, \u201cWhat\u2019s your excuse?\u201d Though some find this inspiring, others accused her of fat-shaming.\nAbby Pell, 33, was trying to inspire other moms to get in shape when she captioned a photo of her ab muscles, \"I have a kid, six pack, and no excuse.\"\nIn fact, Bella is who inspired Pell to include her caption after saying she looked like Wonder Woman.\n\"Now going to the gym is where I have my 'me-time,' which all mums know they need.\"\nAfter Bella was born, Pell struggled to lose the 50 pounds she gained during her pregnancy."}
