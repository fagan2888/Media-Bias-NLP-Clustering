Part of the Mississippi State football team was involved in a bus crash following the team's 31-17 loss to the University of Mississippi on Saturday night.

Mississippi State spokesman Kyle Niblett said there were no injuries in the accident that happened shortly after the Bulldogs left Vaught-Hemingway Stadium. Niblett said the five-bus caravan was waiting on the side of the road while a replacement bus was sent to the scene.

Niblett said he didn't know how the accident occurred.

Mississippi State spokesman Bill Martin posted a message on Twitter shortly after that accident that said "we were involved in accident with buses on (the) highway but no need to panic. Everyone is OK. Just getting some to another bus now."
