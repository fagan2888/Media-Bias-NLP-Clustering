A half-billion-dollar muni business with no financial model and no concrete plan to add even 1kWh of local renewable energy. two times the government FTE per capita of the average city our size. Flashing crosswalks. Reverse angle-in parking. Potholes the size of Volkswagens. Bursting clay-pipe sewer lines. Blue tags that were green tags. More rules, more regulations, still more chronic transients than chronic. Downzoning the Whittier and Grove/Goss affordable neighborhoods while blathering about affordable housing. Eastern bloc architecture. Blah blah blah.\n\nAnd the RUIN-Boulder County ruling elite are upset with the way the city is developing? Seriously. Matt Appelbaum and Lisa Morzel have been on council since the late 80s/early 90s. Macon Cowles, Susan Jones, Sam Weaver, Tim Plass, and Mary Young all served on the Planning Board before being elected to council. All of these \"elected leaders\" have had leadership positions with PLAN-Boulder County and been expressly endorsed by PLAN.\n\nThey have set the agenda on council, handpicked the people they want on Planning Board and Landmarks Board, but somehow, someway, the policies they've enacted are someone else's fault. All this development around town was proposed, rubber-stamped or overregulated into mediocrity or worse by the very people now proposing extreme building moratoriums and demanding a replica historic coal shed be built.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes, we're all thankful for the Blue Line and Open Space; we're glad the Vietnam War ended also. Let's move on. If Boulder wants a different future, remember it's Appelbaum, Morzel, Cowles, Jones, Weaver, Plass and Young, backed by PLAN-Boulder, who have led us here. Let's bring some fresh voices to the table when we're having a discussion about Boulder's future.\n\nMark Gelband\n\nBoulder", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/letters/ci_27615281/mark-gelband-development-who-led-us-here-boulder", "modificationDate": "2015-02-28T19:16:30-0700", "sailthru.section": "Opinion: Letters to the editor", "endDate": "2016-02-28T19:15:14-0700", "description": "Landmarking the unremarkable.
