One-third of those consumers, or about 2 million, ended up paying more than $100 in net monthly premiums.

Roughly one-third of the consumers who could get 2016 HealthCare.gov exchange plan coverage for a very low monthly net premium are choosing to buy more expensive coverage.

About 6.1 million of the people who signed up for 2016 exchange plan coverage through HealthCare.gov from Nov. 1 through Dec. 26 could have gotten the coverage for a net monthly premium of $100 or less, according to a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) report.
