I've never house-hunted beyond the \"2.5BR\" market, and I probably won't be hitting any open houses at Greystone-on-Hudson, either. The super-luxe 100-acre development in Tarrytown and Greenburgh will feature 20 estates ranging in price from $5 million to $20 million.\n\nThe first just came on the market at a hair under $10 million.\n\nFirst look: Super-luxe development debuts in Tarrytown, Greenburgh\n\nBuy Photo Andy Todd, the president of the Greyston Mansion Group, gestures toward a ravine plot at Greystone on Hudson, a new high-end gated community on 100 acres in Tarrytown, photographed June 4, 2015.

A recurring theme was that the 20,000-square-food debut was too gauche (Ira Roth), too much to heat (Ronald Keeperman) and had too many windows to wash (Lisa Anthony).\n\nThere were even two holy cow's and a gee whiz. But the dominant theme could best be described as indignation \u2013 or class envy, depending upon your perspective.\n\n\"This is really stupid,\" wrote Laura Kerns. \"No one needs this much house.\"\n\n\"Wants and needs are very different,\" Tim Osborne shot back. \"No one needs a tattoo but they get them anyhow.\"\n\n\"It's sad, really,\" David Raguso wrote. \"This county just doesn't care about the average person.\"\n\nSaid Dana Doyle, \"Bye bye, middle-class! The rich folk are taking over!\"\n\nSome might note that, this being Westchester, they already had.\n\n\"With the ongoing increase in income inequality, these mega-McMansions are sure to find buyers,\" Susan Rubin weighed in, adding ominously, \"Until the collapse happens.\"\n\nBuy Photo An alcove on the second floor in one of the completed homes at Greystone on Hudson, a new high-end gated community on 100 acres in Tarrytown, photographed June 4, 2015. (Photo: Mark Vergari/The Journal News)\n\nLike others, Daphne Philipson questioned the need for so much square footage. \"The Gilded Age is back \u2013 and we know how well that went for everyone.\"\n\nOf those irked by the ostentatious new construction, Reuben Garcia-Carrasquillo was among the most thoughtful, I thought.\n\n\"Wretched excess,\" he wrote. \"There is nothing wrong with being financially successful, but why then not be reserved about it? How much house does a man need? Find meaning in meaningful things.\"\n\nIndeed. But isn't there an assumption there that prospective buyers are seeking meaning in meaningless things? How big is too big? How reserved is reserved enough? I couldn't venture a guess, personally.\n\nSome were not so much annoyed but still critical of the new homes, critiquing the exterior appearance specifically as a hodgepodge of conflicting architectural styles. \"Looks like it was thrown together at different times by different moods,\" wrote Erika Kislaki-Bauer.\n\nEileen Healy Rehill lamented the addition of \"more overly priced McMansions\" in Westchester rather than \"nice yet affordable housing for the middle class.\" She was far from the only one, with housing for seniors and the disabled also mentioned.\n\nAnn Ehret-Laubner Apgar's take was a succinct mix of being unimpressed yet looking to live and let live.\n\n\"Not for me,\" she wrote, \"but I am glad someone who wants it can own it and enjoy it.\"\n\nAnd never be far from a bathroom.\n\nGrab a cup of coffee and join me and a few of my colleagues this and every Friday morning and a discussion of local issues or whatever's on your mind.
