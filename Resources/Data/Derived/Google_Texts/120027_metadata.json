Bryant has also focused on education, implementing an initiative that improved literacy among elementary school students and establishing public-private partnerships for early childhood education.\n\nEducation was the most contentious issue in the state\u2019s elections this year. The education system is not currently funded up to the amount required by state law. The issue became the subject of a state ballot initiative, Initiative 42, that would have amended the state constitution to allow citizens to sue the state and demand funding for an \"adequate and efficient\" system of public schools and would direct local judges to set education funding if the state legislature did not. The AP reported early Wednesday that the ballot measure failed.\n\nState GOP lawmakers against the initiative introduced an alternative ballot measure, Initiative 42A, that stipulated that the legislature would approve the funding without the need for \u201cjudicial enforcement.\u201d\n\nBryant\u2019s opponent, Gray, was an unusual choice for Democratic voters: A truck driver who has never held elected office or worked in politics, he spent only $3,000 on his campaign, compared to Bryant\u2019s $2.7 million, and his own family did not even know he was running for governor until he unexpectedly won the Democratic nomination in August. He defeated two more-seasoned candidates, and political observers in the state felt that he won because he was listed first on the ballot. Gray himself even forgot to vote in the primary.\n\n\"I was in Jackson and had to do a lot of stuff and just lost track of time, to tell you the truth,\" he told the Associated Press the night of the primary.", "article_metadata": {"description": "His Democratic opponent was a truck driver who spent only $3,000 on his campaign.", "sailthru.expire_date": "2015-11-04 21:34:01 -0500", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "His Democratic opponent was a truck driver who spent only $3,000 on his campaign.", "title": "Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant Easily Wins Re-election", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/phil-bryant-wins-reelection-mississippi_us_5637e18be4b027f9b969c3bf", "image": "http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/5637e3021800002a00303a19.jpeg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "His Democratic opponent was a truck driver who spent only $3,000 on his campaign.", "creator": "@marinafang", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/5637e3021800002a00303a19.jpeg", "height": 1000}, "title": "Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant Easily Wins Re-election", "site": "@HuffPostPol", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-11-03 21:34:01 -0500", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=us_5637e18be4b027f9b969c3bf", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "phil bryant,Mississippi,mississippi governor,elections 2015,phil bryant mississippi", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "phil bryant,Mississippi,mississippi governor,elections 2015,phil bryant mississippi", "published_time": "2015-11-03 21:34:01 -0500", "modified_time": "2015-11-04 00:50:50 -0500", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/marina.fang"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe3dc8\"", "article_summary": "The AP reported early Wednesday that the ballot measure failed.\nThe education system is not currently funded up to the amount required by state law.\nBryant has also focused on education, implementing an initiative that improved literacy among elementary school students and establishing public-private partnerships for early childhood education.\nThe incumbent governor ran on a platform of economic development, touting job growth during his first term.\nHe defeated two more-seasoned candidates, and political observers in the state felt that he won because he was listed first on the ballot."}
