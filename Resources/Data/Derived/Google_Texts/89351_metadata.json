Here in the United States, we cherish religious liberty,\u201d Obama said.\n\nIn two highly publicized cases, the Supreme Court ruled against the Obama Administration to issue stays for organizations that opposed requirements to provide contraception for their employees.\n\n\u201cSo we stand with you in defense of religious freedom and interfaith dialogue, knowing that people everywhere must be able to live out their faith free from fear and free from intimidation, Obama said.\u201d\n\nA group of nuns called Little Sisters of the Poor first fought the White House on the mandate in December 2013 when liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor obliged by giving religiously affiliated organizations an exemption so they did not have to act against their faith due to Obama\u2019s law.\n\n\u201cWith the stroke of their own pen, applicants can secure for themselves the relief they seek from this Court\u2013an exemption from the requirements of the contraceptive-coverage provision,\u201d the U.S. Solicitor General said protesting the decision to give the Catholic organization the freedom to operate according to their faith.\n\nSimilarly, in June 2014 the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Hobby Lobby against Obama. The Court found that a family owned company should not be forced to operate against their faith by being forced to offer contraception to their employees.\n\nThe White House strongly pushed back against the Court\u2019s ruling, calling it an attack on women\u2019s rights.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s decision jeopardizes the health of women who are employed by these companies,\u201d White House spokesman Josh Earnest said.\n\nThe case drove a wedge between religious groups and the Obama administration.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s decision is a victory for religious freedom and another defeat for an administration that has repeatedly crossed constitutional lines in pursuit of big government,\u201d Speaker John Boehner said in response to the Court\u2019s Hobby Lobby decision.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In his speech welcoming Pope Francis to the U.S. on Wednesday morning, President Obama said that the U.S. \u201ccherishes\u201d and \u201cmust defend\u201d religious liberty.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "In his speech welcoming Pope Francis to the U.S. on Wednesday morning, President Barack Obama said that the U.S. \u201ccherishes\u201d and \u201cmust defend\u201d religious liberty, despite accusations that his s", "title": "Obama: \u2018Here In The United States, We Cherish Religious Liberty\u2019", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/issues/obama-here-in-the-united-states-we-cherish-religious-liberty/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/freebeacon.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://freebeacon.com/freebeacon.png", "description": "In his speech welcoming Pope Francis to the U.S. on Wednesday morning, President Barack Obama said t", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama: \u2018Here In The United States, We Cherish Religious Liberty\u2019"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID", "pages": 282024895179874}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Here in the United States, we cherish religious liberty,\u201d Obama said.\nThe White House strongly pushed back against the Court\u2019s ruling, calling it an attack on women\u2019s rights.\n\u201cToday\u2019s decision jeopardizes the health of women who are employed by these companies,\u201d White House spokesman Josh Earnest said.\nSimilarly, in June 2014 the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Hobby Lobby against Obama.\nThe case drove a wedge between religious groups and the Obama administration."}
