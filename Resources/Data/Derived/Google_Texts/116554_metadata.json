In North Carolina, the nonprofit NCHA members reported unreimbursed Medicaid expenses averaging 2.5 percent of total expenses.\n\nHowever, a large portion of the Medicaid payments North Carolina hospitals receive come from the hospitals themselves. Hospitals in the state pay a provider fee that supplements the state and federal tax dollars used to fund the Medicaid program.\n\nBad debt was a much greater share of hospitals\u2019 costs, averaging 8.4 percent of total expenses for the nonprofits.\n\nWhile 15 of the 38 hospitals and hospital networks reported expenses exceeding their revenue, the sum of their revenue exceeded the sum of their expenses by $524 million.\n\nDuke University Health System had revenue less expenses \u2014 what a for-profit business would report as profit \u2014 of $295 million, with 3.5 percent of expenses from charity care, 2.9 percent from unreimbursed Medicaid, and 1 percent from bad debt.\n\nGreenville-based Vidant Medical Center reported $91 million in revenue less expenses, charity care equal to 3.6 percent of costs, bad debt equal to 2.8 percent of costs, and no unreimbursed Medicaid expenses.\n\nSix of the nonprofits reported more than $25 million each in revenue less expenses. Raleigh-based WakeMed, with a net loss of $41 million, was the only one of the 38 nonprofits with a loss exceeding $25 million.\n\nTo shift more of the costs of caring for the poor to federal taxpayers, NCHA has asked state lawmakers to implement the 2010 federal health law\u2019s optional Medicaid expansion.\n\nNCHA failed to respond to a request for comment.\n\nKatherine Restrepo, health and human services policy analyst for North Carolina\u2019s free-market John Locke Foundation, expressed skepticism about putting more North Carolinians on Medicaid.\n\n\u201cExpanding Medicaid may reduce uncompensated care for hospitals, but under-compensated care will become a larger issue in the long-term, since Medicaid pays so far below market rates and doesn\u2019t cover the actual cost of care delivered,\u201d Restrepo told Watchdog.org.\n\nShe explained that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act\u2019s emphasis on insurance mandates and Medicaid expansion to increase insurance coverage has done little to address health care costs.\n\n\u201cPolicymakers needs to think less on how best to distribute insurance cards,\u201d Restrepo said, \u201cand more on how health care can be more affordable for more people \u2014 whether someone has insurance or not.\u201d\n\n\u201cAffordable health care and a strong dosage of price transparency will make health insurance less expensive, will reduce the heavy dependence on subsidized insurance, and will help tackle the indigent care/uncompensated care cost problem,\u201d she added.\n\nThe following table includes uncompensated care data for the 38 nonprofit NCHA members whose latest IRS Form 990 filings are available at GuideStar.org. All figures are for the nonprofits\u2019 2012 tax years ending at varying dates in calendar year 2013, with the exception of Novant Health.\n\nNovant Health data are from tax year (and calendar year) 2013.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Charity care is a service North Carolina's nonprofit hospitals provide in return for tax exemptions, but charity care costs amount to just three percent of the hospitals' expenses.", "title": "'Under-compensated care will become a larger issue in the long-term' for Carolina hospitals - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/08/shutterstock_155901602.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-03-10T16:12:12+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/259153/compensated-care-will-become-larger-issue-long-term-carolina-hospitals/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Health Care", "published_time": "2016-03-10T14:25:26+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-10T16:12:12+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Charity care is a service North Carolina's nonprofit hospitals provide in return for tax exemptions, but charity care costs amount to just three percent of the hospitals' expenses.", "creator": "@jasonahart", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/08/shutterstock_155901602.jpg"}, "title": "'Under-compensated care will become a larger issue in the long-term' for Carolina hospitals - Watchdog.org", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "news_keywords": "charity care, north carolina hospital association, north carolina hospitals, hospital charity care, hospital uncompensated care, medicaid expansion, obamacare expansion, john locke foundation, katherine restrepo"}, "article_summary": "Charity care is a service North Carolina\u2019s nonprofit hospitals provide in return for tax exemptions, but charity care amounts to just 3 percent of the hospitals\u2019 expenses.\nIn many states, charity care is typically the smallest portion of hospitals\u2019 uncompensated care costs.\n\u201cExpanding Medicaid may reduce uncompensated care for hospitals, but under-compensated care will become a larger issue in the long-term, since Medicaid pays so far below market rates and doesn\u2019t cover the actual cost of care delivered,\u201d Restrepo told Watchdog.org.\nHowever, a large portion of the Medicaid payments North Carolina hospitals receive come from the hospitals themselves.\nIn North Carolina, the nonprofit NCHA members reported unreimbursed Medicaid expenses averaging 2.5 percent of total expenses."}
