As Trump whips up populist anger but offers few specifics, Kasich is hoping elected officials will give him a sympathetic ear.\n\n\u201cKasich\u2019s strength is he has practical, hands-on experience dealing with the real issues facing taxpayers, both as a former congressman and a current governor,\u201d said Assemblyman Andy Goodell, a Republican from Jamestown who said he is supporting Kasich. \u201cHe knows that the elected officials here in Albany wrestle with those same issues and understand those issues, and would, as we did, ask him the tough questions.\u201d\n\nAbout half of the chamber\u2019s four dozen Republicans were present, Goodell said, along with some top staff. Ed Ra, a Republican from Long Island, said Kasich eschewed a podium to sit at a table with officials set up in the Fort Orange Club\u2019s President\u2019s Room, adorned with portraits of the industrialists who got the elite institution running at the end of the 19th century. The conversation touched on endorsements and electability, but also budgets and the Common Core.\n\n\u201cWe like public policy. We like sinking our teeth into things, and I think he\u2019s very much cut from that same cloth, so I think it was a productive conversation,\u201d said Ra, who has not endorsed any candidate. \u201cSome of that stuff though, can be seen, for the general public as inside baseball or not the rah-rah type of stuff that you\u2019re going to get from a Donald Trump. How it plays with the general public is another story, but he put himself out there as a \u2018reasonable conservative,\u2019 that he\u2019s going to go out there, make his points and he hopes it resonates.\u201d\n\nMost of New York\u2019s delegates are awarded based on the winners in each congressional district, with the second-place finisher grabbing a pledged delegate if the first-place finisher \u2014 likely Trump, polls show \u2014 is held under 50 percent. (If the winner captures more than a majority, he gets all three delegates.) Allies like Goodell around the state, then, can help Kasich or Cruz deny Trump some delegates ahead of the party\u2019s convention in Cleveland.\n\nThe core of this \u201creasonable conservative\u201d case is electability and this kind of path to frustrating Trump\u2019s path to the nomination. Speaking to reporters next to the sandstone pillars of the Capitol\u2019s Million Dollar Staircase, Kasich repeated his claim that he\u2019s the only GOP candidate who consistently beats Hillary Clinton in general election polls \u2014 and predicted that Trump or Texas Sen. Ted Cruz could cost Republicans control of the State Senate if they led the ticket.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day I\u2019m the only one who consistently beats Hillary Clinton and the only one with the record and experience to actually run this country,\u201d Kasich said, a refrain he later repeated at events in Troy and Saratoga Springs.\n\nRepublican senators rejected Kasich\u2019s claim about their own electoral fragility, and said they would rise and fall based on the quality of their own candidates and records. Carl Paladino, a Trump supporter, said via email that Kasich was a RINO \u201cchumming up with an even bigger fraud in [Senate Republican Leader] John Flanagan.\u201d Kasich also told reporters that he didn\u2019t support a $15 minimum wage \u2014 something the GOP conference just voted for unanimously \u2014 but was not \u201ccrazy\u201d enough to second-guess their calculation.\n\nThese disagreements notwithstanding, other legislators have endorsed Trump or Cruz, and rejected Kasich outright.\n\n\u201cKasich is the embodiment of the status quo, a senior member of the establishment. I don\u2019t care for him,\u201d Assemblyman Kieran Lalor, of Poughkeepsie, said. \u201cParticularly statewide, you have to be somewhat in the middle. But that doesn\u2019t mean that New York Republicans are somehow a mushy middle. I represent a conservative place. That\u2019s he\u2019s tied for last place doesn\u2019t surprise me, despite his pro-amnesty, pro-Obamacare, kind of moderate bona fides.\u201d\n\nMembers of the State Senate also invited Trump to address their conference, but he demurred. About 10 senators \u2014 including Deputy Republican Leader John DeFrancisco and George Amedore \u2014 met with the reality television star in a private room before his rally, shaking hands, taking pictures, and in some cases leaving before Trump\u2019s speech began.\n\nThe meeting was brief, and did not include any formal remarks, each man said. Despite their time with both candidates, neither was prepared to make an endorsement.\n\n\"I'm still a free agent,\" DeFrancisco said. \u201cI think either candidate that I\u2019ve met today would be far superior to the options on the Democrat side, and I\u2019m going to support whoever gets the nomination.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/albany/2016/04/8596355/albany-kasich-plays-inside-game", "image": "http://www.capitalnewyork.com/sites/default/files/a%20-%20kasich-2.png", "type": "article", "title": "In Albany, Kasich plays the inside game"}, "robots": "all", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "Ohio governor visits the Capitol"}, "article_summary": "ALBANY \u2014 In this year of the outsider, John Kasich spent the middle of Monday pitching an unlikely audience: New York\u2019s elected class.\nAs Trump whips up populist anger but offers few specifics, Kasich is hoping elected officials will give him a sympathetic ear.\nAllies like Goodell around the state, then, can help Kasich or Cruz deny Trump some delegates ahead of the party\u2019s convention in Cleveland.\nWe like sinking our teeth into things, and I think he\u2019s very much cut from that same cloth, so I think it was a productive conversation,\u201d said Ra, who has not endorsed any candidate.\nThese disagreements notwithstanding, other legislators have endorsed Trump or Cruz, and rejected Kasich outright."}
