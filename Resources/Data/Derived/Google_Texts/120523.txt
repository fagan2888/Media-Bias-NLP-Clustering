WebPT, which develops online electronic health records for rehab therapists, announced this week its acquisition of Therabill, maker of Web-based practice management tools. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.

Grayslake, Ill.-based Therabill focuses on PM software for physical and occupational therapists, speech-language pathologists and behavioral health specialists.

WebPT officials say the acquisition is a "huge step" toward its aim of developing a comprehensive suite of rehab therapy technologies

"Therabill and WebPT serve similar audiences, have similar company histories, and uphold similar commitments to providing exceptional customer service," said WebPT CEO Paul Winandy, in a statement. "It made a lot of sense for us to combine our companies and present our customers with a true end-to-end business solution."

WebPT's current integration with Therabill like those with its other billing partners, officials say: Data flows from WebPT into the billing software.

Once WebPT enables bidirectional integration with Therabill, however, rehab therapy practices will have a single tool for documentation, scheduling, reporting and billing.

"Bringing Therabill under the WebPT umbrella is another step toward our company's goal of delivering an all-encompassing software platform to help therapists achieve greatness in practice," said WebPT co-founder and chief operating officer Heidi Jannenga.
