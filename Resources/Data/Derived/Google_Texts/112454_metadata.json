The new regulations, which apply to those who furnish and receive payee statements and tax-related documents, generally follow proposed regulations issued last year, albeit with some modifications.\n\nBased on the final regulations, a truncated TIN may be used in lieu of the taxpayer\u2019s\n\nSocial Security number (SSN), Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN), Adoption Taxpayer Identification number (ATIN) or Employer Identification Number (EIN) on certain documents. With a truncated TIN, only the last four digits of the identifying number are displayed. The other numbers are replaced with asterisks or Xs.\n\nDue to increasing concerns over the risk of identity theft, the IRS launched a pilot program allowing information return filers to truncate a payee\u2019s identifying number on various statements, such as Forms 1098, 1099 and 5498, for the 2009 and 2010 tax years. Subsequently, the program was generally extended for the 2011 and 2012 tax years, although certain forms were still excluded.\n\nBut the proposed regulations issued in 2013 permitted use of a truncated TIN only if it was affirmatively authorized by the IRS. Thus, there were limits on the benefits of the program. Critics pointed out these shortcomings.\n\nUnder the new final regulations, every information rule doesn\u2019t have to be separately amended so that a truncated TIN may be used. This alleviates the IRS\u2019 administrative burdens. It won\u2019t have to implement changes each time to authorize use for a document nor will it have to keep track of those that have changed and those that haven\u2019t.\n\nAs opposed to the proposed regulations, the final regs also permit the replacement of an EIN with a truncated TIN. And the truncated version is now permitted on electronic payee statements as well as paper statements. Finally, the new regulations make the pilot program permanent.\n\nHowever, a truncated TIN still won\u2019t be allowed for a return filed with the IRS. The IRS says the entire identifying number is needed to ensure compliance and to verify the information on the return. For example, you can\u2019t use a truncated TIN on a Form W-9 or to replace an employer\u2019s EIN on the W-2s it provides to employees.\n\nTaxpayers may have already relied on the 2013 proposed regulations. The amendments to the specific information reporting rules are generally effective for payee statements due after December 31, 2014.\n\nWhat does it all mean to you? The final regulations are generally being viewed by the accounting profession as a positive. They are expected to discourage hackers from obtaining taxpayer ID numbers and using those numbers for illegal activities. As someone who often deals with confidential and sensitive information, the extra layer of security is welcome. Of course, you may have to refer to other documents to access a client\u2019s account or double-check numbers, but the few minutes should be worth the effort.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As part of its ongoing efforts to deter identity theft, the Internal Revenue Service has issued final regulations on use of truncated Taxpayer Identification Numbers (TINs).
