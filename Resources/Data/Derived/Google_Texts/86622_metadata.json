His overtime fumble recovery against Cincinnati ensured \u201d Wilson\u201d was his, and that the Broncos would have a spot in the playoffs.\n\nBut it also reaffirmed Ware\u2019s comeback from a back injury that sidelined him in separate stints this season for a total of five games and sapped the Broncos of one of their key defensive pieces.\n\nThe 11th-year veteran who last month was selected to his ninth Pro Bowl, played 42 of the Broncos\u2019 72 defensive snaps against Cincinnati. It was the next step in his slow, meticulous recovery that he has said may have ended too soon the first time around.\n\nWare initially injured his back during the Broncos\u2019 Oct. 11 victory at Oakland. Two week\u2019s rest proved not enough as he re-injured it two games into his return, on Nov. 8 on the turf at Lucas Oil Stadium.\n\nThe Broncos\u2019 edge rusher who quickly racked up 6.5 sacks for a loss of 52.5 yards in his first seven games (both second-most on the team behind Von Miller\u2019s 10 for a loss of 70 yards) has since taken a more cautious approach in his recovery.\n\n\u201cIt was a difficult injury because it\u2019s like you have to have time to heal,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can work out all you want to, you can do all the exercises, but until (the) inflammation goes down, that\u2019s when you can go out there and play. It\u2019s harder when you\u2019re thinking about \u2014 because I\u2019m a workhorse, so I think I need to go out there and work. I\u2019m like, \u2018I\u2019m going to work as hard as I can and it\u2019s going to go away.\u2019 No, you\u2019re going to sit down. You\u2019ve got to rest, you\u2019ve got to ice, and this right here is what\u2019s going to make it better.\u201d\n\nThe slow approach is one that paid dividends Monday but may offer further benefits. Ware says he plays pain-free now, and his coaches say he\u2019s ready to return to the field full-time, starting Sunday, when the Broncos host San Diego in a game that could land them a first-round playoff bye and, with help from New England, the No. 1 seed in the AFC.\n\n\u201cHe looked like the DeMarcus Ware,\u201d defensive coordinator Wade Phillips said after a practice this week. \u201cThe guy that was dominating early in the year. I\u2019d be surprised if he doesn\u2019t have a really good game this game.\u201d\n\nDespite missing nearly a third of the season because of the injury, Ware, at 33, established himself early on as a renewed force in Phillips\u2019 3-4. His 15 quarterback hits is tied with Malik Jackson for the second-most on a team that has 114 total. His seven tackles for loss are tied for the third-most among the Broncos\u2019 78 total.\n\nHis impact on the field has trumped his age on the roster. Bringing home \u201cWilson\u201d last Monday was a celebrated triumph, but it was just another step in his return to form.\n\n\u201cI put Wilson up for a while,\u201d he said, \u201cbut hopefully we can do something big this week and we can get another one.\u201d\n\nNicki Jhabvala: njhabvala@denverpost.com or @NickiJhabvala", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "\u2018Wilson,\u2019 full-speed play reaffirms DeMarcus Ware\u2019s return to form", "title": "\u2018Wilson,\u2019 full-speed play reaffirms DeMarcus Ware\u2019s return to form", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/01/01/wilson-full-speed-play-reaffirms-demarcus-wares-return-to-form/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151209__bronx-warep1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151209__bronx-warep1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-01T13:52:28+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-18T21:32:59+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "I\u2019m like, \u2018I\u2019m going to work as hard as I can and it\u2019s going to go away.\u2019 No, you\u2019re going to sit down.\nBringing home \u201cWilson\u201d last Monday was a celebrated triumph, but it was just another step in his return to form.\nHis overtime fumble recovery against Cincinnati ensured \u201d Wilson\u201d was his, and that the Broncos would have a spot in the playoffs.\nDeMarcus Ware saw the ball fly through the hands of Bengals quarterback AJ McCarron and knew it was over.\nTwo week\u2019s rest proved not enough as he re-injured it two games into his return, on Nov. 8 on the turf at Lucas Oil Stadium."}
