The suit is seeking class-action status.\n\nIn an email to The Huffington Post, CVS spokesman Michael DeAngelis wrote that Watterson's suit has \"no merit.\"\n\n\"Our employee health benefits plan complies with all applicable laws,\" he wrote. \"By knowing their blood pressure, cholesterol and glucose numbers, as well as other potential health risks, our colleagues are empowered to work toward or maintain healthy behaviors that can lower their overall health care costs.\"\n\nAs for worker privacy, DeAngelis wrote that \"all results are kept confidential by an independent program administrator\" and \"cannot be accessed by CVS Caremark management.\"\n\nAbout 93 percent of U.S. employers have some kind of wellness program -- an umbrella term that includes everything from in-house yoga to help quitting smoking, according to a 2013 survey by the National Business Group on Health, an association of large employers.\n\nEighty percent of those companies also offer health exams to their employees, according to a study last year by the RAND Corporation. They typically give employees incentives to participate, and the Affordable Care Act has boosted the size of such incentives.\n\nIt's less common for employers to penalize workers for not taking part, Mattke said. In some cases, companies will tell workers they get a reward -- say $100 -- for participating, even though the employer actually hiked the cost of their health plan -- say, by $100 -- the year before, making the absence of this \"reward\" actually a penalty.\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Obamacare Haters Obamacare Haters\n\n1 of 7 McDonald's Peter Bensen, McDonald's chief financial officer , said on a conference call last year that Obamacare will cost the company and its franchisees $140 million to $420 million per year.
