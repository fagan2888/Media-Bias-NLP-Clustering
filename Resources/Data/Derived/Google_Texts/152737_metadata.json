This ad was largely credited with helping to turn the public against the proposed reform. Let's take a look at what Harry and Louise had to say about insurance in 1994:\n\nBreaking apart their gripes one by one:\n\n\"This was covered under our old plan.\" Under Obamacare, many are seeing their insurance benefits go down as prices go up. For instance, these loyal Obama supporters found that they lost big time under Obamacare.\n\n\"The government may force us to pick from a few healthcare plans designed by government bureaucrats.\" Uh, accurate. The new plans require men to pay for pregnancy coverage, among other things.\n\n\"Having choices we don't like is no choice at all.\" While President Obama promised that those who like their insurance may keep it, thousands of people who enjoyed their insurance plans are getting cancellation notices.\n\nIn another Harry and Louise ad, Louise speaks to a man who lives in a state with \"community rating,\" where everyone pays the same for insurance policies regardless of age or smoking. Under the Affordable Care Act, elderly customers can only be charged three times as much as a healthier young person, and a company is not allowed to charge someone with complex health needs (such as HIV) more than someone who is healthy. In the ad, Louise's friend experienced his premiums doubling\u2014and in the real world, people are seeing their premiums skyrocket under Obamacare.\n\nApparently \"sometime in the future\" means 2013.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Psychics. .05/26/2016 19:18:33PM EST.", "author": "Christine Rousselle", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Psychics.", "title": "Christine Rousselle - Flashback: Anti-Hillarycare Advertisement Basically Was Prophetic", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/christinerousselle/2013/11/11/flashback-antihillarycare-advertisement-basically-was-prophetic-n1744496", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2013/11/11/6.png", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Psychics.", "title": "Christine Rousselle - Flashback: Anti-Hillarycare Advertisement Basically Was Prophetic", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/christinerousselle/2013/11/11/flashback-antihillarycare-advertisement-basically-was-prophetic-n1744496", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2013/11/11/6.png", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Flashback: Anti-Hillarycare Advertisement Basically Was Prophetic, Christine Rousselle, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "While President Obama promised that those who like their insurance may keep it, thousands of people who enjoyed their insurance plans are getting cancellation notices.\nIn the ad, Louise's friend experienced his premiums doubling\u2014and in the real world, people are seeing their premiums skyrocket under Obamacare.\nIn another Harry and Louise ad, Louise speaks to a man who lives in a state with \"community rating,\" where everyone pays the same for insurance policies regardless of age or smoking.\nUnder Obamacare, many are seeing their insurance benefits go down as prices go up.\nIn 1994, following Hillary Clinton's proposal for universal health coverage, insurance companies released an ad featuring Harry and Louise, a fictional couple who were disappointed by the changes to their insurance plan."}
