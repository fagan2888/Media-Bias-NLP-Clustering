As CIO 3.0s bridge the gaps between the clinical sides and the C-suites of their organizations \u2014 and learn to challenge the status quo in the process \u2014 they\u2019re tasked with \u201cnot just watching change happen but guiding the strategy,\u201d said CHIME President and CEO Russell Branzell.\n\nIn an era when hospitals and health systems must balance everything from relentless cyber threats to changing payment models and regulatory mandates to integrating delivery systems, that strategy is going to be subject to change. \u201cWe don\u2019t know exactly what the industry will look like in 2020,\u201d said Timothy Zoph, senior vice president at Northwestern Memorial Healthcare, \u201cbut we can tell it\u2019s going to be a period of discontinuity.\u201d\n\nZoph said that means it\u2019s the CIO\u2019s job to step in and work out the potential kinks. According to a survey of 123 hospital CIOs Zoph and Christi Health CIO Donna Roach oversaw, respondents saw change management as the most important skill a CIO could have. \u201c[A CIO needs] to be the person who actually stands up and delivers results,\u201d Zoph said. \u201cYour experience is too valuable to be on the sidelines. It\u2019s going to become a core requirement of your job to be seen as a change leader in your organization.\u201d\n\nAccording to the rest of the C-suite, change management often means that CIOs must create strong personal networks throughout their organizations and utilize them effectively, Roach said. They must learn how to approach both the \u201cresistors and fence sitters\u201d and bridge that \"gap between the clinical folks in the organization and bring that to the inside table.\u201d\n\nZoph and Roach urged the CIOs at the conference to survey their own executive teams about what qualities they were expected to deliver, emphasizing the importance of getting on the same page as job descriptions evolve.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to acknowledge that the skills have gotten us where we are today may not be the skills that we need to take us to the next level,\u201d Zoph said. \u201cIf there was ever a time to align the expectation of technology in the leadership role, the time is now.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "ORLANDO, Fla.-- As legislative changes, industry consolidation and an increasingly digital economy push today\u2019s health care CIO to innovate and disrupt like never before, today\u2019s successful chief innovation officers are cast from a new mold: They\u2019re CIOs 3.0.
