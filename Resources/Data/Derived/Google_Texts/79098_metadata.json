Or, if you prefer, privatized. The USDA late Thursday released its revamped poultry inspection rules, an overhaul to the 60-year-old system which, by allowing plants to self-inspect, it claims will simultaneously reduce the number of federal inspectors on site and incidences of foodborne illness.\n\nPowerful, if true.\n\nIn the old system, Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) officials were stationed on poultry processing lines to check birds for visible problems, like abscesses and sores, as well as for feces they may have carried over from the factory farms (or as the USDA calls it, \u201cquality assurance\u201d). Now, that responsibility is being (voluntarily) handed over to the plant operators, as the agency plans to phase out 770 USDA inspectors, a move that will save it an estimated $90 million over three years. The move represents a shift in focus, from those visible defects to pathogens like Salmonella and Campylobacter, which can\u2019t be spotted with the naked eye. It\u2019s for that reason that the USDA boasts the rules will prevent up to 5,000 foodborne illnesses each year.\n\nTo the relief of just about everyone (industry excluded) the USDA decided to do away with the most controversial part of the rule: its plan to speed up inspection lines from the already rapid clip of 140 birds per minute to an even quicker 175. The increase, argued unions, watchdog groups and members of Congress, would\u2019ve had catastrophic consequences for food and worker safety, as well as increased animal abuse.\n\nSo at the very least, the USDA won\u2019t be making a bad problem worse. But poultry production remains dangerous (\u201cone of the most dangerous occupations in the U.S.\u201d an organizer with Interfaith Worker Justice told Salon\u2019s Josh Eidelson last year) and about one million chickens and turkeys are already painfully boiled alive every year, often because lines move too quickly for them to be properly slaughtered (FSIS and the National Chicken Council contend that the number is much lower; according to a USDA spokesperson, the new system further corrects for this problem by allowing more inspectors to freely move around the plant and observe live birds). Some groups expressed misgivings about the announcement for those very reasons: the National Council of La Raza, the country\u2019s largest Hispanic advocacy group, for example, \u201cpraised\u201d the USDA for stopping short of making the industry even more dangerous, but they and others criticized the agency for not doing more to drive reform. \u201cIt is not a victory for consumers, workers or animals,\u201d Daisy Freund, senior manager of farm animal welfare at the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, told the New York Times. \u201cThey maintained the status quo of line speeds that already move too fast.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Can putting the onus on the industry really make food safer?", "author": "Lindsay Abrams", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Can putting the onus on the industry really make food safer?", "title": "The USDA is now letting poultry plants conduct their own inspections", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/08/01/the_usda_is_now_letting_poultry_plants_conduct_their_own_inspections/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/shutterstock_124416385.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Can putting the onus on the industry really make food safer?", "creator": "@readingirl", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/shutterstock_124416385.jpg", "title": "The USDA is now letting poultry plants conduct their own inspections", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "The USDA is now letting poultry plants conduct their own inspections", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, chicken, Food safety, FSIS, poultry, salmonella, USDA", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfaf4\"", "article_summary": "Topics: chicken, Food safety, FSIS, poultry, salmonella, USDA, Sustainability News, News, Politics NewsPoultry inspection, prepare to be modernized.\nNow, that responsibility is being (voluntarily) handed over to the plant operators, as the agency plans to phase out 770 USDA inspectors, a move that will save it an estimated $90 million over three years.\nThe USDA late Thursday released its revamped poultry inspection rules, an overhaul to the 60-year-old system which, by allowing plants to self-inspect, it claims will simultaneously reduce the number of federal inspectors on site and incidences of foodborne illness.\nIt\u2019s for that reason that the USDA boasts the rules will prevent up to 5,000 foodborne illnesses each year.\nSo at the very least, the USDA won\u2019t be making a bad problem worse."}
