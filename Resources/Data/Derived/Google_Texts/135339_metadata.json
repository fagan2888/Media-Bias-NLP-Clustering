The fate that awaits this gaggle of temporary survivors is as grim and unsurprising here as it is in countless other low-budget horror knockoffs of its kind, and neither the thinly drawn characters nor the murkily lensed action sequences rise above the routine. Still, director Peter Engert does conjure and for the most part maintain a suitably hellish mood, aided considerably by a murky color paletteredolent of nausea, cancer and death (courtesy of d.p. Scott Winig).\n\nAn audio montage of news reports spell out the premise over the opening credits: A string of political assassinations in the Middle East has ushered in the outbreak of World War III, and humanity\u2019s days are decidedly numbered. The story proper picks up somewhere in northeast Texas, where a conspicuously computer-generated mushroom cloud sends young doctor Hunter (C.J. Thomason) into a storm cellar with several other desperate souls, barely clinging to what remains of life. Huddled together in this shadowy underground bunker, they tend to each other\u2019s wounds, dole out meager rations and await a cruelly protracted demise by radiation poisoning, the film steadily marking their progress as day after painful day passes.\n\nNot everyone is prepared to go quietly \u2014 least of all the redneck whose sudden, belligerent outbursts make him the most dangerously unpredictable member of the group and by far the most irritating (even though he\u2019s played by the under-employed Edward Furlong). Still, even he doesn\u2019t entirely escape our understanding by the end, and there are enough sympathetic faces among the rest, among them Thomason, Monica Keena and \u201cThe Wire\u2019s\u201d Andre Royd, to supply a measure of goodwill, if not exactly a rooting interest. As these characters waste away (their radiation-induced wounds made manifest by Rip Odebralski\u2019s special makeup effects), you don\u2019t root for them to survive so much as die as quickly and painlessly as possible.\n\nWhich, in a sense, sums up the primary achievement of \u201cAftermath.\u201d Treading territory well covered by everything from \u201cNight of the Living Dead\u201d to \u201cThe Road,\u201d Engert\u2019s film is fairly ineffectual as character drama and pretty dismal as action. Christian McDonald\u2019s screenplay remains curiously noncommittal on the question of whether there really are radioactive zombies afoot; suspense is nonexistent, and the climactic fight sequence is marred by incongruous, momentum-killing freeze-frames. Still, as an exercise in sustained claustrophobia, the movie is not without its grisly accomplishments. Its effectiveness lies not in those moments when its characters are struck down without warning, but rather in the lingering sense that death has slowly, quietly taken up residence among them.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "9 refugees await post-nuclear holocaust fate in \u201cAftermath\u201d", "title": "9 refugees await post-nuclear holocaust fate in \u201cAftermath\u201d", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/07/21/9-refugees-await-post-nuclear-holocaust-fate-in-aftermath/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140716__20140718_C5_ae18scAFTERMATHp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140716__20140718_C5_ae18scAFTERMATHp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-21T12:38:38+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T08:37:20+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "It\u2019s a long, slow death for nine unfortunate refugees in \u201cAftermath,\u201d an often tedious but clammily atmospheric end-of-the-world thriller set in the wake of a nuclear holocaust.\nThe story proper picks up somewhere in northeast Texas, where a conspicuously computer-generated mushroom cloud sends young doctor Hunter (C.J.\nThomason) into a storm cellar with several other desperate souls, barely clinging to what remains of life.\nStill, as an exercise in sustained claustrophobia, the movie is not without its grisly accomplishments.\nIts effectiveness lies not in those moments when its characters are struck down without warning, but rather in the lingering sense that death has slowly, quietly taken up residence among them."}
