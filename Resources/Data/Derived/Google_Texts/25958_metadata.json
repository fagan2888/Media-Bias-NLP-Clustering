Niagara Falls Mayor Paul Dyster last week vetoed a resolution by the city Council that would have ended the gilt edged health care benefits Council members receive for their part time jobs.\n\nDyster said the highly unusual veto of a Council resolution for a benefit only Council members receive, was a simple matter of pragmatism.\n\n\u201cProviding a compensation and benefit package which is both fair and responsible is an important factor to ensuring we attract candidates with diverse backgrounds and viewpoints,\u201d he told the Niagara Gazette.\n\nCouncil members were not happy.\n\n\u201cI am curious as to why the mayor would leverage his executive privilege to veto a resolution that the city council passed in an effort to save taxpayers money,\u201d said the sponsor of the measure, freshman Councilman Kenneth Tompkins said.\n\nThe Council measure passed 3-2. It is highly unlikely that Dyster\u2019s veto will be overridden, as it would take a super majority of four votes to do so.\n\nCouncil members earn $12,000 a year but the health care coverage is said to be worth $21,981. Council members who are covered by health insurance at their regular jobs can receive an opt out payment of $9,713 for a family or $3,526 for a single person.\n\nIn 2012, Councilwoman Kristen Grandinetti moved to end the opt out payment after it was revealed that she\u2019d been taking the family amount despite the fact she is single. She is covered by health insurance from the Niagara Falls City School District, where she teaches kindergarten. Grandinetti later made restitution.\n\nShe also practiced what she preached declining to take the opt out subsequently.\n\nCouncil Chairman Andrew Touma, who is also a school teacher, called Dyster\u2019s veto disappointing.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s driving this, I think we have a very diverse council as it is, but I don\u2019t think the council members ran for the monetary gain,\u201d Touma said. \u201cIt\u2019s been two years since I\u2019ve been on the council and we haven\u2019t made strides.\u201d\n\nTouma has health insurance provided to him through the Niagara Falls School District. In addition Touma accepts $9,713 annually from the city, on top of his $12,000 council salary for opting out of health insurance with the city.\n\nTouma is one of several scores of Niagara Falls city and school employees who earn in excess of $100,000. According to www.seethroughny.net, Touma earns 103,000 from his job at the school district in addition to his $21,713 from the city council.\n\nNewly elected council members Ezra Scott and Kenny Thompkins both receive health insurance from the city. Thompkins\u2019 council health insurance cutting measure would not have affected present council members but only future elected council members.\n\nThe position of city council is part time; few employers anywhere offer full health insurance coverage for part time employees. According to a study made by the Buffalo News, Niagara Falls pays the highest opt out payments for employees who do not accept health insurance coverage of any municipality in the region.\n\nCritics of Dyster\u2019s veto say that the reason for running for elected office should not be the salary, benefits and perks but should be motivated by a true zeal to serve, and that elected officials should lead the way in making cuts to a budget that in Niagara Falls surpasses revenue by millions every year.\n\nNiagara Falls is ranked by the New York State Restructuring Board as having the highest property taxes in the state in proportion to the value of the real estate being taxed.\n\nThe measure to suspend health insurance benefits for future council members could have saved taxpayers more than $100,000 per year based on present cost of health insurance assuming all five members of the council chose to take the city\u2019s health insurance.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Niagara Falls Reporter", "description": "It\u2019s enough to make one wonder what happened to the servant part of public servant.
