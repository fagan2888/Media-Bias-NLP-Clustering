SpecialtyCare To Buy Bankrupt ProNerve, Building on Health Care Tech M&A

The target filed for Ch. 11 on Feb. 24 to facilitate the sale

SpecialtyCare is buying ProNerve, a surgery-monitoring provider, through a bankruptcy sale.

Denver-based ProNerve provides intraoperative neuromonitoring services to surgeons. The company's 200 associates will become part of SpecialtyCare. ProNerve has about 350 customers in 31 states.

ProNerve filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Feb. 24 to facilitate the sale. As of press time, a sale motion had not been filed with the court. The company listed between $10 million and $50 million in assets and liabilities on its petition. Judge Kevin Carey of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware in Wilmington is assigned to the case.

Nashville-based SpecialtyCare provides outsourced operating room clinical services.

Health care providers have been looking to bulk up on various technologies to improve patient outcomes and to handle an increase in patients because of the Affordable Care Act. For more, see 5 Technologies That Drove Health Care M&A in 2014.
