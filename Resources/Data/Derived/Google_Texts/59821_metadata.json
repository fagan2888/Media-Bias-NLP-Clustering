We\u2019ve never been able to get around a filibuster in the Senate to get a bill to repeal ObamaCare. By the way, this also defunds Planned Parenthood, which is a very high priority of ours. We could never get through the Senate filibuster, so we used the one rule, the one tool we have a year \u2013 we call this reconciliation, so we can get around the Senate filibuster to get a bill on his desk defunding ObamaCare and Planned Parenthood. We\u2019re passing that tomorrow. I fully anticipate the president will veto this. I mean, how many times have we\u2019ve been saying we want to put bills on his desk saying who we are, what he believes and he will veto. We will have a veto override vote on the later in the month. But this is the first time we\u2019ve been able to get on his desk a bill going after ObamaCare and Planned Parenthood.\u201d\n\nRyan touted his leadership and how things would be done differently under his speakership as well as Congress\u2019 efforts to take on the executive branch through the court system. But he also emphasized the importance of winning the presidential election this year.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been a frustrated conservative as well,\u201d he said. \u201cNumber one, I\u2019m hitting the reset button. We\u2019re going to do things differently around here in the House. Number two, I\u2019m decentralizing power so every conservative, every member of Congress has a greater ability to participate in the process so we can have this place work the way the founders intended it to work. But number three, we have to use every tool at our disposal to keep this executive branch honest, to keep oversight over them. So let\u2019s take this executive amnesty \u2013 we went the court route and we\u2019ve been successful. We\u2019re going after the president in court on ObamaCare issues as well. We\u2019ve succeeded there. We\u2019re using the power of the purse with riders on a whole host of things \u2013 pro-life riders, Internal Revenue Service riders, EPA riders and at the end of the day, Sean, what really matters is winning an election. We have to have a conservative in the White House.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have to have a conservative in the White House that isn\u2019t trashing the Constitution, that isn\u2019t going with the phone and the pen routine and that is why \u2013 and the reason I took this job and my colleagues know this is we have to go on offense in 2016 and we have to offer a bold agenda to the country so that the people of this country who do not like the direction America is heading, which we don\u2019t that we owe them an alternative,\u201d Ryan added. \u201cWe have to give them a bold conservative agenda so that the men and women of this country can decide which way the country goes in 2016. We want a mandate election. If we win that election, then we have the mandate, then we have the wherewithal, then we have the Republican president, the Republican Congress with a conservative agenda to put in place in 2017. That is why I\u2019m doing this job in the first place.\u201d\n\nFollow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor", "article_metadata": {"description": "Paul Ryan: \u2018We Have to Use Every Tool at Our Disposal to Keep This Executive Branch Honest\u2019", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Paul Ryan: \u2018We Have to Use Every Tool at Our Disposal to Keep This Executive Branch Honest\u2019", "title": "Paul Ryan: \u2018We Have to Use Every Tool at Our Disposal to Keep This Executive Branch Honest\u2019 - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 532, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/01/Ryan16.jpg", "height": 399}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2016/01/05/paul-ryan-we-have-to-use-every-tool-at-our-disposal-to-keep-this-executive-branch-honest/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Paul Ryan: \u2018We Have to Use Every Tool at Our Disposal to Keep This Executive Branch Honest\u2019", "creator": "@jeff_poor", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/01/Ryan16.jpg", "title": "Paul Ryan: \u2018We Have to Use Every Tool at Our Disposal to Keep This Executive Branch Honest\u2019 - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "obamacare, Paul Ryan, Planned Parenthood, Sean Hannity,Abortion, Breitbart TV, Obamacare,Paul Ryan", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Abortion", "tag": "Sean Hannity", "published_time": "2016-01-05T21:47:30-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart TV,Abortion,Obamacare"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "But number three, we have to use every tool at our disposal to keep this executive branch honest, to keep oversight over them.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERFirst, Ryan explained the game plan for repealing ObamaCare and defunding Planned Parenthood.\nWe\u2019ve never been able to get around a filibuster in the Senate to get a bill to repeal ObamaCare.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been at this for what, five years now?\u201d Ryan said.\nSo let\u2019s take this executive amnesty \u2013 we went the court route and we\u2019ve been successful."}
