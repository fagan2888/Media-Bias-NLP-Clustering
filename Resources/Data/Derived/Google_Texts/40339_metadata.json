The project originally sought to raise $200,000 but successfully reached $1,069,386 all thanks to 6,879 backers.\n\nBlink has been dubbed the first ultra-affordable smart home monitoring system that is battery-powered, making it truly wireless, and it is even HD. It is considered one-of-a-kind and equally perfect for rents or homeowners.\n\nExplaining more about the monitoring, the Blink team stated, \u201cCreate a system that covers your entryways and windows, monitors the garage, or keeps a watchful eye over the kids\u2019 room. Plus our unique technology delivers more than a full year of battery life for extended, no-hassle peace of mind.\u201d\n\n\u201cBlink is thoughtfully designed to make peace of mind easy and accessible. As soon as motion is detected, video starts recording and an alert is sent to your smartphone or tablet, so you can see exactly what caused the alert and decide how to react.\u201d\n\nBlinks features are the following:\n\nHD Video: Ensures that the user gets a clear view of their home or business, with minimal distortion or blurring.\n\nMotion Detection: When armed, any detected motion triggers the recording of a short video clip.\n\nInstant Alerts: The user can quickly receive a push notification or email alert with a link to the video attached, so you can decide how to respond.\n\nLive View: Easily access on-demand video streaming through the Blink app.\n\nInstant On: Video recording starts within a fraction of a second, so you\u2019ll get a clear look at who or what triggered the alert.\n\nTemperature Sensor: Easily monitor the temperature in the user\u2019s home.\n\nNight Vision: The LED Illuminator, coupled with advanced low-light performance of the company\u2019s proprietary technology, ensures that the user will see what\u2019s happening, day or night.\n\nBuilt-in Microphone: Allows easy audio access, so the user can see and hear what\u2019s happening at home.\n\nPrivacy Assurance: A non-hackable, hardware-based LED indicator and optional audio alert lets the user know when Blink is recording, or Live View mode, so they will never be caught off guard.\n\nStatus Alerts: Receive notification when the Wi-Fi connection at home is lost, or when it\u2019s time for a battery change.\n\nDuring a recent interview, co-founder of Blink, Don Shulsinger, stated that they determined there was no product like the Blink existing on the market today. He also sees Blink being the beginning of a great product line they can offer to consumers. He also commits to be adding Apple\u2019s home kit/iOS integration plus rolling in Android functionality.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "blink, don shulsinger, hardware, home monitoring, home security, kickstarter, technology, finance, fintech, crowdfunding, marketplace lending, peer to peer lending", "ca_image": "http://www.crowdfundinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Blink-150x150.jpg", "og": {"site_name": "Crowdfund Insider", "description": "Earlier this week, Andover, MA-based company Blink close its crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter for its wireless home monitoring and alert system.
