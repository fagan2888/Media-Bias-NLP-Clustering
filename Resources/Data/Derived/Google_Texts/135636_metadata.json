We didn\u2019t sit on them. I know we scored a lot of touchdowns, and that\u2019s obviously what you\u2019re looking for.\u201d\n\nNewton became the first Carolina quarterback in franchise history to throw four TD passes in the first half as the Panthers jumped out to a 31-14 lead.\n\nJonathan Stewart ran for 102 yards on 21 carries and caught a 12-yard touchdown pass. Olsen, Mike Tolbert, Ted Ginn Jr. and Devin Funchess also caught TD passes.\n\n\u201cHe has a good command of what we\u2019re doing out there,\u201d Rivera said of Newton, who has 20 TD passes this season \u2014 four shy of his career high with six games left to play.\n\nAndre Roberts had a 99-yard kickoff return for a touchdown for the Redskins (4-6), who\u2019ve lost nine straight on the road.\n\nCousins finished 22 of 30 for 207 yards with one touchdown and one interception. He also fumbled twice on sacks. Running back Alfred Morris left the game early in the first quarter with a rib injury and did not return.\n\nWith the game tied at 14 in the second quarter, Newton led an eight-play, 92-yard touchdown drive, capping it with a 2-yard TD pass to Ginn.\n\nThe Redskins had a 74-yard interception return for a touchdown by cornerback Chris Culliver called back on the drive when officials ruled he had delivered an illegal helmet-to-helmet hit on Olsen before the interception.\n\nThe game turned from there with the Panthers scoring 30 consecutive points.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a 14-point turn right there,\u201d Redskins coach Jay Gruden said. \u201cThe referee made a decision, made a call, and it\u2019s not challengeable, so there\u2019s really no use talking about it.\u201d\n\nOn Washington\u2019s next possession, rookie Matt Jones was stripped of the ball by Luke Kuechly and Thomas Davis recovered at the Redskins 24. Newton found Olsen on a crossing route for a 9-yard TD pass to push the lead to 28-14.\n\nKony Ealy had a strip-sack of Cousins on Washington\u2019s next possession and recovered the ball at the Carolina 38 leading to Graham Gano\u2019s field goal at the end of the first half.\n\nCarolina\u2019s momentum carried into the second half as Bene Benwikere sacked Cousins on the first play from scrimmage on a cornerback blitz, jarring the ball loose and recovering at the Redskins 20. Newton found Funchess for his franchise-tying fifth TD pass of the game to give Carolina a 38-14 lead.\n\nWith a game on Thursday at Dallas, Panthers coach Ron Rivera removed most of his starters early in the fourth quarter with his team up 44-14.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re undefeated for a reason,\u201d Cousins said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t just happen on accident. They have great players and a great scheme, and they have several players who\u2019ve played in this system for several years. You see the fruit of that in how they\u2019ve played this season.\u201d\n\nWashington\u2019s loss comes one week after a 47-14 win over the New Orleans Saints.\n\n\u201cLast week, we felt pretty good \u2014 top of the mountain,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cIt\u2019s a humbling game.\u201d\n\nNOTES: Roberts\u2019 99-yard kickoff for a touchdown was the first allowed by the Panthers in 100 games. \u2026 Olsen became the Panthers career leader in yards receiving by a tight end, passing Wesley Walls. \u2026 The Panthers have run for at least 100 yards in 21 straight games.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Cam Newton throws 5 TDs, unbeaten Panthers improves to 10-0", "title": "Cam Newton throws 5 TDs, unbeaten Panthers improves to 10-0", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/11/22/cam-newton-throws-5-tds-unbeaten-panthers-improves-to-10-0/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151122_041723_cam-newton-2.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151122_041723_cam-newton-2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-22T16:16:29+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-20T04:28:07+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cIt\u2019s a humbling game.\u201dNOTES: Roberts\u2019 99-yard kickoff for a touchdown was the first allowed by the Panthers in 100 games.\nNewton proved again he can beat teams with his arm, throwing a career-high five touchdown passes on Sunday and the Carolina Panthers improved to 10-0 with a dominating 44-16 win over the Washington Redskins.\nOlsen, Mike Tolbert, Ted Ginn Jr. and Devin Funchess also caught TD passes.\nNewton found Olsen on a crossing route for a 9-yard TD pass to push the lead to 28-14.\nNewton found Funchess for his franchise-tying fifth TD pass of the game to give Carolina a 38-14 lead."}
