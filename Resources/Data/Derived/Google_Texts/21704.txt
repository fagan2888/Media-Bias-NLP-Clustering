As the Zika virus continues to spread throughout Central and South America, the Pan American Health Organization has decided to extend its awareness campaign to Sesame Street.

The two organizations got together to create two 30-second videos featuring beloved muppets Elmo and Raya to teach children about mosquito-borne illnesse. The first PSA reminds young viewers how important it is to cover bowls and trash containers to reduce the spread of the virus — if these contain water, mosquitos can breed in them. When Elmo and Raya return in the second PSA, they recommend preventive measures children and parents can take to stay safe, like wearing long-sleeved shirts and not skimping on the bug spray.

“Children often help educate their parents, especially in areas of poverty,” WHO spokesman Daniel Epstein told CNN. For that reason, Lewis Kofsky, Sesame Workshop's vice president for Latin America, hopes the campaign reaches every child in the region.The videos currently air only in Spanish and Portuguese. But according to Pan American’s Facebook page, English versions are coming soon. Until then, Adios, Zika!
