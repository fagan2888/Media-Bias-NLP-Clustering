Costs of health insurance for workers increased in 2015, continuing more than a decade-long trend, according to new data from the Kaiser Family Foundation.

The 2015 average increase for single and family premiums was 4 percent compared to 2014 numbers, the foundation's data shows. It follows years of steady increases, most notably from 2000 to 2005, when the annual premium that workers and employers pay to keep health insurance increased 69 percent, while worker' earnings only increased 15 percent.

In response to the increase, employers have shifted costs to their employees. While the average amount employers paid for their workers' health care premiums increased from 2005 to 2015, the share of the premium paid by workers increased 83 percent. Workers are spending a larger share of their incomes on health care.

Deductibles are the out-of-pocket costs consumers pay each year before their health insurance kicks in to pay the rest. At companies of all sizes, plans with deductibles of $1,000 or more increased. Nearly half of covered workers had such a plan by 2015.
