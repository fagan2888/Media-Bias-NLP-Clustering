And I\u2019m making good contact, which is important for spring training.\u201d\n\nThe Rockies shut out the Reds 1-0, with six pitchers holding the Reds to only three hits.\n\n\u201cIt was good all the way around,\u201d manager Walt Weiss said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been good this spring. We have guys working on things, but at the same time they have been able to go out there and perform on the mound.\u201d\n\nThe Rockies got only seven hits, but CarGo had two of them. He was especially pleased with his double to left.\n\n\u201cThat was a big at-bat for me,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was one of the things that I set on my mind before the game. Just try to hit the ball the other way and get some bat speed and hit the ball in the air. All of the contact that I made before was groundballs. The timing is going to come back the more I play, and I feel good.\u201d\n\nStarter Jordan Lyles, showing good late movement, pitched three scoreless innings. He wriggled out of trouble in the third after giving up a leadoff triple to Rugenio Suarez. Lyles struck out Brandon Phillips to end the inning on a changeup. In fact, he struck out out Phillips twice on changeups, a pitch he\u2019s been emphasizing since last season.\n\nLyles\u2019 final line for his third Cactus League game: no runs, one hits, two walks, three strikeouts. He came into the game focused on honing his curveball (see video).\n\nHits\n\n* Lefty John Lannan, who provides some depth at the back end of the rotation, struck out three in his two innings of work. He allowed two hits and a walk.\n\n* Back-up first base candidate Ben Paulsen smashed a double off the center-field wall in the sixth, but the Rockies were unable to bring him home.\n\n* Reliever Tommy Kahnle closed out the game in the ninth, setting the Reds down 1-2-3.\n\n\u201cEven though it\u2019s spring training, you like to see that \u2014 see what a guys does out there finishing the game. It adds a little bit to the moment,\u201d Weiss said, adding that Kahnle\u2019s combination of a mid-90s fastball and good changeup can leave batters perplexed.\n\nMisses\n\n* Starting catcher Nick Hundley had a chance to break the game open in the fourth when he came to the plate with the base loaded, but he went down swinging. He made up for it in the seventh, getting a base hit to center and scoring from third on a Reds throwing error to put the Rockies ahead 1-0.\n\nUp Next\n\nThe Rockies host the Royals at 2:10 p.m. (MDT) at Salt River Fields.
