I would strongly encourage conducting an open competitive procurement to a robust pool of vendors.\u201d\n\nA spokeswoman for DoITT did not return a request for comment.\n\nThe News previously reported that Bloomberg administration officials were keen on approving the deal because former Mayor Bloomberg saw the 311 hotline as one his legacies.\n\nThe News also reported that a mysterious website, Dont911nyc311.com, was created to protest the contract award.\n\nIn early January, the Obama administration declined to renew its contract with a CGI subsidiary to design and build the Obamacare site HealthCare.gov after myriad glitches thwarted countless Americans trying to use it to buy coverage.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.credits": "NEW YORK DAILY NEWS", "sailthru.author": "ANNIE KARNI", "twitter": {"description": "The company fired by the feds for the botched rollout of the Obamacare website has been \u201cfired\u201d again.", "title": "HealthCare.gov co. loses $10M NYC contract", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/healthcare-gov-loses-10m-nyc-contract-article-1.1602569", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1602428.1391577117!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/hotline5n-1-web.jpg", "site": "@nydailynews", "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.tags": "Michael Bloomberg, Bill De Blasio, Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act", "parsely-author": "Annie Karni", "parsely-type": "article", "keywords": "Michael Bloomberg, Bill De Blasio, Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act", "nydn_tags": "obamacare", "news_keywords": "Michael Bloomberg, Bill De Blasio, Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act", "parsely-link": "http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/healthcare-gov-loses-10m-nyc-contract-article-1.1602569", "parsely-title": "HealthCare.gov co. loses $10M NYC contract", "sailthru.date": "2014-02-05T00:20:48-0500", "sailthru.title": "HealthCare.gov co. loses $10M NYC contract", "nydn_section": "New York", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-02-05T05:20:48", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1602428.1391577117!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/hotline5n-1-web.jpg", "description": "The company fired by the feds for the botched rollout of the Obamacare website has been \u201cfired\u201d again.", "robots": "NOARCHIVE", "fb": {"admins": 1594068001, "app_id": 107464888913, "pages": 268914272540}, "msvalidate.01": "02916AAC0DA8B068EFE01D721E03ED7E", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NYDailyNews/"}, "sailthru.description": "The company fired by the feds for the botched rollout of the Obamacare website has been \u201cfired\u201d again.", "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "parsely-section": "New York", "og": {"site_name": "NY Daily News", "description": "The company fired by the feds for the botched rollout of the Obamacare website has been \u201cfired\u201d again.", "title": "HealthCare.gov co. loses $10M NYC contract", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/healthcare-gov-loses-10m-nyc-contract-article-1.1602569", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1602428.1391577117!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/hotline5n-1-web.jpg", "type": "article"}, "parsely-tags": "obamacare", "p": {"domain_verify": "78efe4f5c9935744af497772f68a0ee7"}, "nydn_byline": "ANNIE KARNI", "parsely-image-url": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1602428.1391577117!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/hotline5n-1-web.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf039\"", "article_summary": "Controller Scott Stringer\u2019s office refused Tuesday to approve a contract awarded by the Bloomberg administration to the Montreal-based firm CGI to overhaul the city\u2019s 311 information hotline.\nThe News previously reported that Bloomberg administration officials were keen on approving the deal because former Mayor Bloomberg saw the 311 hotline as one his legacies.\nThe News also reported that a mysterious website, Dont911nyc311.com, was created to protest the contract award.\nAn additional concern, sources said, was that the outgoing administration pushed through the contract on its final hours, denying de Blasio a say in the 311 overhaul.\n\u201cMy office has returned the contract to DoITT with additional questions.\u201dCGI, the company responsible for the early failures of HealthCare.com, pictured, has lost its $10 million contract with New York to overhaul the city's 311 hotline."}
