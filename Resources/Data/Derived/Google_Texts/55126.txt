Sick of cleaning up the hieroglyphics left behind by graffiti vandals, residents in southwest Denver have started writing to judges and asking for tougher sentences on taggers.

Bravo, we say.

The Denver Post’s Sadie Gurman reported that public works crews have scrubbed off 39 percent more graffiti this year than they had by this time last year. And while some may say the problem is harmless, violent crime is often tied to the graffiti, as the case of the shooting of an 8-year-old boy in April showed.

Part of the problem is that it is difficult to prove a felony case against graffiti vandals because police must show $1,000 worth of damage has been done in a “single criminal episode.”

Still, known repeat perpetrators of the spray-painting and pen-marking on public and private property have gotten off at times with light sentences, often not serving jail time. Spurred on by police, neighbors now are asking judges not to let them off so easy.

Let’s see how the color of jumpsuit orange influences their artistry.
