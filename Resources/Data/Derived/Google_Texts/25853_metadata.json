Back then, the insurer took a $118 million one-time charge to help UPMC and Jameson Health System buy the now-defunct St. Francis Health System hospitals. That charge, plus an operating loss at its dental division, meant Highmark reported a $83.4 million net loss in 2002.\n\nBefore then, operating in the red was commonplace for Highmark \u2014 from 1996, the year Highmark was created via the merger of Blue Cross of Western Pennsylvania and Pennsylvania Blue Shield, through 2002, the company reported operation losses in most years.\n\nSince then, it\u2019s posted a string of profitable years, buoyed by growth in its diversified for-profit divisions, including dental, vision and reinsurance units.\n\nKaren Hanlon, Highmark Health\u2019s senior vice president of finance, said in a statement that Highmark Inc. \u2014 the insurance division \u2014 is \u201cwell capitalized,\u201d adding \u201cthe numbers appear to show a drop in net income, but that is because of the assets we acquired from our affiliation from the Delaware health plan in 2012.\u201d\n\nAs for Allegheny Health Network \u2014 which, in addition to West Penn Allegheny, includes St. Vincent Medical Center in Erie and Jefferson Regional Medical Center \u2014 Ms. Hanlon said the $107 million loss falls between the \u201cbest case\u201d and \u201cworst case\u201d scenarios projected by Highmark when it sought approval from the Pennsylvania Insurance Department to purchase West Penn Allegheny.\n\nThe results for Highmark Inc., meanwhile, \u201cwas a little bit below\u201d projections, she said, \u201cbecause of the competitive environment in the health plan business\u201d as well as the roll-out of national health care reforms. Those reforms come with a cost for insurers in the form of more heavily regulated individual health plans and a variety of taxes and fees for insurers, built into the new health law.\n\nFor example, Highmark will owe about $133 million toward an annual health insurer fee this year, part of a total $8 billion to be contributed by all health insurers apportioned to each insurer by way of its national market share.\n\nDespite the new costs and regulations, other large insurers appear to be managing to stay in the black during the early months of the new health insurance exchanges associated with the Affordable Care Act. Their successes, relative to Highmark\u2019s operating loss, demonstrate the financial risk involved in launching a health network and absorbing the debt of the West Penn Allegheny Health System.\n\nWellpoint, Aetna, Cigna, Humana and UnitedHealth Group all issued promising first-quarter earnings numbers, with most crediting better-than-expected Obamacare enrollment as one of the driving factors. Humana shares, in fact, hit a 52-week high on May 12, while Aetna and UnitedHealth are also showing robust year-to-date returns.\n\nHighmark added about 130,000 new health insurance enrollees through the Obamacare exchanges, and despite the newly competitive local health insurance market, the insurer reported it had retained 95 percent of its customers as of Dec. 31, 2013.\n\nThat share was holding near 90 percent this year for upcoming July renewals. \u201cWe feel good about that cycle,\u201d Ms. Hanlon said.\n\nAside from the $107 million loss, Allegheny Health Network \u201chas made progress in strengthening its financial position,\u201d said Ms. Hanlon, noting the $120 million in capital expenditures last year for a new surgery center in Monroeville, construction of a health and wellness pavilion in Wexford, and the expansion of clinical services throughout the network.\n\nThe parent company also reported a surplus of nearly $6 billion.\n\nSteve Twedt contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Despite the loss, the network \u201chas made progress in strengthening its financial position,\u201d said\u00a0one Highmark official.", "og": {"site_name": "Pittsburgh Post-Gazette", "description": "In its first companywide financial statement since reorganizing its corporate structure and launching its own hospital network, Highmark Health reported a $186 million operating loss for 2013.
