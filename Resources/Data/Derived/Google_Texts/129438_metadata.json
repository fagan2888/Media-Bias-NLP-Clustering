She took direct aim at Sanders when she called herself a \u201cprogressive who actually likes to make progress.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll of us know, don\u2019t we? Don\u2019t we know that we need real solutions to the challenges we face? I\u2019m running to tear down all the barriers that hold people back across our country. I am not making promises I can\u2019t keep,\u201d the former secretary of state said.\n\nClinton dropped several Minnesota references in her speech, and thanked many of the state\u2019s top Democrats who support her campaign.\n\nSanders largely stuck to more familiar messages.\n\n\u201cIt sounds like some of you are ready for a political revolution,\u201d the Vermont Senator said as he took the stage.\n\nSanders, who had earlier appeared at a forum on race and economic opportunity in Minneapolis, told the DFL donors that he wants to fix a broken criminal justice system and end what he views as a \u201ccorrupt\u201d campaign finance system. Sanders also took aim at income inequality.\n\n\u201cMy friends, this is not an American economy. It is not a fair economy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a rigged economy, and together we\u2019re going to change that.\u201d\n\nDFL leaders declared the event the largest in the state party\u2019s history. It brought in a record $1 million in donations.\n\nGeorge Humphrey, 23, of Wayzata who said he is not related to the Minnesota political icon, was among those who attended the dinner, even though he hasn\u2019t made up his mind yet which candidate he will support.\n\nWhile his sister backs Clinton, and many of his friends are Sanders supporters, Humphrey wanted to hear for himself what each candidate had to say.\n\n\u201cBoth options are better than anything coming out of the Republican side. So, I\u2019m focused more on just general support for the Democrats than trying to figure out specifically which one I support,\u201d he said.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether Minnesota will see more campaign visits before March 1st.\n\nRepublican Party of Minnesota Chair Keith Downey said he\u2019s not aware of any plans by GOP presidential candidates, but thinks one or more could drop in at the end of the month. Even if they don\u2019t, Downey said the Minnesota supporters of the candidates are ready to roll.\n\n\u201cThe field teams are totally geared up and mobilized and doing a lot work out in the districts and working hard to drive their people to the polls,\u201d Downey said. \u201cThere\u2019s certainly activity here whether or not we see any candidates individually present we\u2019ll wait and see.\u201d\n\nMinnesota Republicans hold their own fundraiser, the annual Lincoln Reagan Dinner, Tuesday night in Minneapolis. No presidential candidates are scheduled to appear.", "article_metadata": {"mpr-content-group": "capitol-view", "mpr-collection": "Politics", "WT.cg_n": "News Blogs", "WT.z_mpr-site": "news", "description": "The two contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination spoke at a dinner that raised $1 million for the state DFL Party.", "author": "Tim Pugmire", "og": {"site_name": "Capitol View", "description": "The two contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination spoke at a dinner that raised $1 million for the state DFL Party.", "title": "Clinton, Sanders court MN Dems ahead of caucuses", "url": "http://blogs.mprnews.org/capitol-view/2016/02/clinton-sanders-court-mn-dems-ahead-of-caucuses/", "image": "http://publicradio1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/capitol-view/wp-content/themes/mpr-news-blogs/images/capitol-view-opengraph.png?v=2", "type": "article"}, "mpr-site": "news", "twitter": {"description": "The two contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination spoke at a dinner that raised $1 million for the state DFL Party.", "title": "Clinton, Sanders court MN Dems ahead of caucuses", "url": "http://blogs.mprnews.org/capitol-view/2016/02/clinton-sanders-court-mn-dems-ahead-of-caucuses/", "image": "http://publicradio1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/capitol-view/wp-content/themes/mpr-news-blogs/images/capitol-view-opengraph.png?v=2", "site": "@mprnews", "card": "summary"}, "mpr-content-topic": "politics", "WT.cg_s": "Capitol View", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Clinton dropped several Minnesota references in her speech, and thanked many of the state\u2019s top Democrats who support her campaign.\nEven if they don\u2019t, Downey said the Minnesota supporters of the candidates are ready to roll.\nShe took direct aim at Sanders when she called herself a \u201cprogressive who actually likes to make progress.\u201d\u201cAll of us know, don\u2019t we?\nHillary Clinton used a Minnesota-themed appeal, and Bernie Sanders relied on his familiar campaign themes as the two made separate pitches to ardent Minnesota Democrats at a fundraising dinner in St. Paul Friday night.\nClinton said she wants to build on the accomplishments of President Obama, including the Affordable Care Act."}
