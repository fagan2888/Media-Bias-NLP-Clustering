According to a common line of thinking, campaign donors and primary voters are pulling politics to the extremes. Most Americans, the story goes, would prefer their legislators to chart a moderate course.\n\nIn a recently published paper, I question this view. Using a survey designed to measure support for extreme policies, I find that the characterization of the public as largely centrist rests on shaky ground. On many issues, much of the public appears to support more extreme policies than legislators do. And while many argue that today\u2019s engaged activists support more extreme policies than the broader public, my findings suggest the opposite: The disengaged and infrequent voters who allegedly constitute the moderate middle are actually more likely to endorse extreme policies than politically active voters.\n\nWhy might we have missed much extremism in the public generally and among the less engaged? The answer is subtle, but has important implications for how we should think about the the public\u2019s attitudes and politicians\u2019 positions. And it might be best explained by pretending you have a crazy uncle.\n\nSuppose your uncle believes that the United States should nationalize the health-care system (a very liberal view) and that gay people should be jailed (a very conservative view). And suppose your uncle is represented in Congress by a moderate Republican who supports civil unions (but opposes gay marriage) and who supports helping the poor purchase health insurance (but opposes Obamacare), two positions just right of center.\n\nYour uncle\u2019s views can\u2019t really be described in ideological terms like \u201ccenter left\u201d or \u201cvery conservative.\u201d He has some mix of very liberal and very conservative views, many of them extreme. But if we try to compare your uncle\u2019s views to his congressperson\u2019s positions in abstract, ideological terms, as academics and journalists often do, some plain facts about your uncle and his legislator both become obscured. Since your uncle supports some liberal policies and some conservative policies, we\u2019d call him a \u201cmoderate on average.\u201d However, his congressperson\u2019s conservative votes on both Obamacare and gay marriage mean we might call the legislator conservative. We thus might condemn your uncle\u2019s congressperson for being a conservative extremist while celebrating your uncle\u2019s moderation. However, it\u2019s quite clear that your uncle\u2019s views tend to be further outside the mainstream, just not consistently in one direction.\n\nThe lesson is this: Attempting to describe Americans\u2019 general political views across multiple issues can yield misleading pictures of where they really stand relative to their representatives. Most Americans are simply not ideologically consistent enough that ideological labels such as \u201cconservative,\u201d \u201cliberal\u201d or \u201cmoderate\u201d accurately describe them.\n\nSo, how common are the \u201ccrazy uncles\u201d and how common are the real moderates in the public? In this survey, I sought to measure support for extreme policies, like establishing a maximum income or banning the sale of birth control pills. I presented Americans with questions on a dozen different issues. Each question had seven possible responses \u2014 a couple of extreme response options on either side (let\u2019s call these points -3, -2, 2, and 3), options representing the parties\u2019 general positions (at -1 and 1), and a moderate option (at 0). I also sent this survey to a sample of state legislators.\n\nHow often do members of the public support more extreme policies than legislators?\n\nThe most common way of looking at the data is presented in the figure below. Here, I averaged each person\u2019s responses across multiple issues to generate a summary of each person\u2019s overall views (or \u201cideology\u201d) and then calculated how extreme their views appeared overall. For example, your uncle would score as a 3 on the gay rights question and a -3 on the health-care question, meaning he would average out to a 0, or \u201cmoderate on average.\u201d The congressperson who scores at the Republican position of 1 on both issues appears more conservative \u2014 and more extreme \u2014 with an average position of 1. Looking at the data this way, the figure suggests that the public is much more moderate than legislators, as political scientists increasingly report.\n\nBut what if we don\u2019t treat Americans as ideologues and instead look at their views on each issue, one by one? To calculate the next figure, I considered how far from the middle each respondent\u2019s views typically were on each issue. For example, if your uncle answered a 3 and a -3, he would be on average 3 away from the middle. However, when his congressperson answers at 1 on both, it identifies his responses as \u201con average 1 away from the middle,\u201d now correctly capturing the fact that his positions tend to be more moderate than your uncle\u2019s, even though he is more ideologically consistent. When we compute extremity this way, the new conventional wisdom is upended: The public appears likelier to support extreme policies than legislators.\n\nIndeed, although each of the parties is out of step with public sentiment on some issues, neither consistently outflanks the public. For example, about 40 percent of Americans seem to have more liberal positions on tax policies than most Democratic elected officials, while much of the public would also prefer more conservative policies on immigration and abortion than most Republican elected officials would endorse.\n\nThere is a similar inversion of conventional wisdom when it comes to the attitudes of the most politically engaged Americans, who are often blamed for pulling politics to the extremes. When I examine whether more engaged individuals are more likely to support extreme policies on any given issue, they actually appear slightly less likely to do so. (For those interested in the details, the paper dives into these issues at greater length.)\n\nMany political observers have the sense that something has gone awry in American politics, and the metaphor of extreme elites spurning a moderate public is understandably appealing. They may be right to worry that American politicians are more partisan and less responsive than in decades past, that interest groups have succeeded in countermanding majority will in many instances, or that each of the parties is out of step on some issues. However, concerns about a wholesale \u201cdisconnect\u201d between extreme elite positions and moderate public opinion may be overstated.\n\nIn fact, the Americans who we often call moderates may be less likely to adopt moderate positions on any given issue. These Americans appear more aptly described as \u201cconflicted,\u201d agreeing with each party on some issues and more extreme than either party on others.\n\nOverall labels like \u201cmoderates,\u201d \u201cliberals\u201d or \u201cextremists\u201d are often not able to describe individual Americans\u2019 opinions at all \u2014 and, when we do analyze public opinion in ideological terms like these, we\u2019re likely to be led astray. As the relationship between mass opinion and politicians\u2019 actions differs a great deal by issue, better understanding about what may ail American politics may require attending to the unique politics each issue presents.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nThis is the latest post in our ongoing series on political polarization.
