Estrada says there were too many passengers and luggage on board the plane which was not manufactured to handle the weight.\n\n\n\nSheriff Estrada says the pilot, 57-year-old Mituo Tamayama is in critical condition. Another passenger is in critical condition and the other two are listed as stable. The student pilot is from Japan. All four victims are being treated at the Banner UMC Trauma ICU in Tucson.\n\n\n\nFirst responders rushed to Nogales International Airport after the plane had trouble during takeoff Saturday afternoon. Sheriff Estrada says the small plane landed hard shortly after takeoff.\n\n\n\nThe pilot suffered the most injuries to his head, according to Estrada. The plane was headed to California when something went wrong, and it grazed the top of a hillside on the way down. Those on board were airlifted to Banner UMC.\n\n\n\nFirst responders from Nogales Suburban Fire District, Rio Rico Medical & Fire District, Tubac Fire District, Patagonia Marshal\u2019s Office, Santa Cruz County Sheriff\u2019s Office and the US Border Patrol all responded to the crash.\n\n\n\nCopyright 2015 Tucson News Now.
