The old Dillard's store is the lone remaining part of Twin Peaks Mall. It will be part of Village at the Peaks. ( Johnnie St. Vrain / Longmont Times-Call )

Johnnie: Now that almost all of the Twin Peaks Mall has been leveled, I notice that one of the Dillard's buildings is still standing and doesn't appear to be part of the demolition project.

I looked at the Village at the Peaks website, and it wasn't clear if that building will be reused as part of the new development. Or are they going to blow it up on live TV or something befitting the whole Dillard's fiasco? â€” Demolition Spotter

Demolition Spotter: As you might already know, the developer has repurposed and is recycling many of the materials from the old mall. One of repurposed parts of the mall is that building.

The one building that held up the process of the redevelopment is the one that will remain standing as part of the new Village at the Peaks.

Dillard's moved out of that building as the mall closed. Alan Ginsborg, principal director of developer NewMark Merrill Mountain States, said that in the new shopping center, it will house Gold's Gym and Sports Authority, among other tenants.

And how is the work coming?

"So far, so well," Ginsborg said. "But for weather days, construction is proceeding more or less as we anticipated. We are very much focused on having our opening at the beginning of the fall."
