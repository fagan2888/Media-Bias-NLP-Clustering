After retiring from NASA, he embarked on a bicycle ride called Rocket Trek across Turtle Island to get Native students engaged with science and math\u2014and discovered two life passions.\n\nRELATED: Astronaut John Herrington Blasts Off Into Space\n\nIndian Country Today Media Network caught up with Herrington, the first enrolled American Indian to fly in space, to find out what he has been up to since that bike ride, which turned out to be fateful\u2014in a good way.\n\n\u201cThat bike ride actually really changed my life in a lot of respects,\u201d said Herrington. \u201cAbout seven days into the bike ride I pedaled into Idaho, spoke to the Nez Perce Tribe. And the woman who did my press releases, well, she\u2019s now my wife.\u201d\n\nThe woman, Margo Aragon, had helped elder Horace Axtell write his book, A Little Bit of Wisdom: Conversations With a Nez Perce Elder (Confluence Press, 1997).\n\n\u201cI had purchased that book for my mom in \u201997, and I knew Horace from the American Indian Science and Engineering Society,\u201d Herrington said. \u201cHe was an elder, and I happened to be a keynote speaker back in \u201997 at a conference. Little did I know that in 2008 I would meet the [other] writer of that book and fall in love.\u201d\n\nThat brought him to Lewiston, Idaho, where he is now earning a PhD in education at the University of Idaho. His dissertation research is focused on the motivation and engagement of Native people in the sciences\u2014his second passion\u2014centering on a NASA program called Summer of Innovation.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m researching students on the Duck Valley Reservation, the Shoshone-Paiute tribes,\u201d Herrington said. \u201cMy research shows that they increased their interest in math and science after exposure to this NASA program. I will graduate in May.\u201d\n\nIn addition he works helping to promote the Chickasaw Nation. That led him to meet a Hollywood producer who grew up in Oklahoma, \u201cand we are currently producing a documentary on my tribe,\u201d Herrington said. \u201cIt\u2019s called Unconquered. The segment we\u2019re doing right now is really from migration legends. They\u2019re all legends, history of the tribe, up to the first encounter with Hernando de Soto.\u201d\n\nHerrington has inspired Indigenous Peoples in all corners of Turtle Island. In September he received a traditional Blackfoot name from Piikunii Nation Elder Leonard Bastien after speaking at the Iniskim Centre at Mount Royal University in Calgary, Canada.\n\n\u201cCommander Herrington is a highly esteemed person to represent aboriginal people,\u201d Bastien said, according to a statement issued by the university. \u201cAnd, in our culture, our beliefs, our stories, and as well as for his ancestors the eagle is always the one that flew the highest\u2014today he is the Golden Eagle Chief, Bee Daa Naah, the one who will continue to fly higher and rise above.\u201d\n\nThe astronaut appears this month on CBS to celebrate Native American Heritage Month as well.\n\nRELATED: CBS Honors Chickasaw Astronaut John Herrington for Heritage Month\n\nHerrington spoke at length with ICTMN on his passion for getting Native students involved in the sciences, on what indigenous knowledge can contribute to modern science and engineering, and on watching Sandra Bullock\u2019s untethered tools fly off into space.\n\nWhat is the importance of getting American Indians to study math and science?\n\nThe idea is that\u2014the folks who learn math and science\u2014we\u2019re going to be the ones who change the world we live in.\n\nIn the 1960s there were people motivated by what we were doing\u2014I being one of them. But you need to make it realistic for them. When I was growing up I dreamed about being an astronaut but I didn\u2019t realize there was a reality of that. But it became a reality years later.\n\nAt naval test pilot school, I realized that many people who had graduated before me in the late \u201950s, early \u201960s, I realized that a lot of them had been NASA astronauts, had been navy test pilots. I was in the same schools, doing the same career path. There are a lot of kids out there who may not have had a role model in that kind of position before, and the reality is that they can achieve that if they so choose.\n\nRELATED: Gravity Wins: NDN Geek Reflects on Not Having the Right Stuff\n\nWhat can Chickasaw or indigenous perspectives in general bring to space exploration?\n\nLong before there was western science, our ancestors were doing remarkable things in observing the world around us and making structures that captured the solar cycle. Chaco canyon is a great example of that.\n\nThey were very talented observers. Long before western science, western mathematics, came along, they were building these remarkably detailed structures. Our ancestors were doing it. Native people have been very talented engineers and scientists for millennia. They did it for survival. You have to be very observant to the world around you in order to survive.\n\nOn another side of that, talking about the southwest, about my tribe\u2019s [mounds]\u2014looking at the mounds structures, they\u2019re oriented to the cardinal directions. These huge mounds, built by hand, align with the cardinal directions. How did they do that, measure things out and build it? It took a lot of expertise to do that. So those were remarkable engineers thousands of years ago. That\u2019s directly related. So that\u2019s near and dear to my heart.\n\nI like to solve problems. I like to see how stuff works. I like challenge. My ancestors were able to rise to challenges that came their way. I\u2019d like to say I\u2019m doing the same thing.\n\nWhat has seeing Earth from afar taught you?\n\nI think you see something from a really remarkable perspective. You see where you\u2019re from, from a very high perch. It made me feel really insignificant. It made me feel that I was a very small player in a very big world.\n\nIt makes you step back and see things from a really macro view, and really appreciate what you have. I\u2019ve seen the world from the perspective of space, I\u2019ve seen the world from underwater for 10 days [in a NASA space-simulation exercise], and I\u2019ve seen the world from cranking across the country on a bicycle. And they each give perspective in their own way.\n\nRELATED: The World's Best View: 5 Things That Seeing Earth From Outer Space Can Teach Us\n\nDid you see the movie Gravity? Did it strike a chord?\n\nIt was entertaining. It was kind of fun to see them use some tools that I had used. They didn\u2019t tether their tools. I tethered my tools. I didn\u2019t want to lose my tools.\n\nThe view of Earth is far more spectacular than the movie. They did a remarkable job, but it\u2019s so much better than that.\n\nI saw it in 3-D. It was kind of fun watching tools flying away, things coming at you and stuff. It was a bad day for Sandra Bullock in space.\n\nWhat do you miss most about being in space?\n\nSpace walking.\n\nWhat message would you like people on the ground to get from seeing the Earth from space?\n\nJust appreciate what they have. Appreciate how remarkable the Earth is. It\u2019s the only one they have.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A chat with Chickasaw astronaut John Herrington on the anniversary of his historic liftoff as the first enrolled Indian in space.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2013/11/23/native-history-astronaut-john-b-herrington-chickasaw-becomes-first-american-indian-space", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/herrington-spacesuit-nasa.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Native History: Astronaut John B.
