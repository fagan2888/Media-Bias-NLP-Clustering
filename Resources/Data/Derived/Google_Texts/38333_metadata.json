Maryland, Oregon and Hawaii in particular experienced significant technical issues regarding eligibility determinations, account registrations and basic usability. However, officials in the four states with the largest enrollment totals \u2014 California, New York, Kentucky and Washington \u2014 pointed to several factors they said positioned their exchanges for success.\n\nOne common refrain among state exchange officials was the importance of simplicity in their marketplaces' operational structure and online user interface.\n\n%%BREAK%%\n\n\u201cFrom an operational standpoint, we wanted to have one central website and customer service center that would handle applications and calls from New Yorkers,\u201d said Donna Frescatore, executive director of New York's insurance exchange, NY State of Health. \u201cRegardless of which program a user qualifies for, they're all channeled to the same web portal and customer service center. We thought that it would be important from the consumer's perspective to have a single \"front door' to the system.\u201d\n\nA second element that exchange officials said was key was allowing online users to browse health care plans and determine eligibility for Medicaid or premium subsidies anonymously, using only basic demographic information.\n\nBy contrast, the federal exchange, Healthcare.gov, initially required users to register prior to gaining access to eligibility and plan information.\n\n\u201cThe goal was to create an e-commerce experience that customers were already familiar with, such as an Amazon or Expedia,\u201d said Curt Kwak, chief information officer of the Washington Health Benefit Exchange. \u201cUsers can enter in basic information such as ZIP code and estimated annual income to see what types of options are available to them.\u201d\n\n%%BREAK%%\n\nState officials said their exchanges also benefited from decisions to initially forgo features such as mobile applications and online chat networks, which they said helped preserve bandwidth for their sites core functions.\n\n\u201cOur system is very simple,\u201d said Carrie Banahan, executive director of Kynect, Kentucky's public insurance exchange. \u201cWe don't have a lot of graphic elements and the site doesn't take up a lot of bandwidth. The language is very simple and the site overall is very easy to navigate.\u201d\n\nAnother critical factor in the disparate performances of the state-run insurance marketplace and the federal exchange appears to be the extent to which the respective systems were stress-tested prior to their launches.\n\nDuring an October hearing before the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee, executives of the private contractors that designed and built the federal exchange testified that end-to-end testing of the federal website did not begin until two weeks before launch.\n\nTesting of the states' insurance exchanges, by contrast, began as early as April 2013. In Kentucky, Ms. Banahan said the state began its testing in July and performed more tests just before it launched.\n\n\u201cOne of the key aspects that seems to have been a stumbling block for a lot of other states, and certainly for the federal government, is the account registration mechanism,\u201d Ms. Banahan said. \u201cWe made sure that we really put that system through its paces prior to launch. We had the state's Medicaid staff, our in-house (information technology) department as well as our contractor's staff all test the system independently.\u201d\n\n%%BREAK%%\n\nState exchange officials also said continuous post-launch testing of their marketplaces' information technology systems has helped them address capacity and usability issues.\n\n\u201cSince the site's launch, we've been doing 24/7 auditing in order to give us some indication of where there are code irregularities and functionality impairments,\u201d said Dana Howard, deputy director of communications for California's insurance exchange, Covered California.\n\nCalifornia's exchange website experienced significantly longer load times than designers intended, and was taken offline for coding updates and bandwidth expansion the weekend of Oct. 5, four days after its launch. But it was back online the following Monday. Without round-the-clock auditing, he said the website's down time could have much longer.\n\n\u201cWe were trying to determine what was causing the long load times for the site's pages, because they were extending well beyond the page load time goals we had set,\u201d Mr. Howard said. \u201cSo we had to identify where it was specifically that those barriers were coming up that kept the pages from loading, and that took a little bit of time to work through.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Business Insurance", "description": "Rigorous testing and an emphasis on simplicity helped several state-run health insurance exchanges avoid many problems that bedeviled the launch of the federal government's exchange.Excluding Medicaid enrollments, public health insurance marketplaces operated by 14 states and the District of...", "title": "State-run health insurance exchanges see successful enrollments - Business Insurance", "url": "http://www.businessinsurance.com/article/20140105/NEWS03/301059993", "image": "http://www.businessinsurance.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CB/20140105/NEWS03/301059993/AR/0/AR-301059993.jpg", "type": "article"}, "image_src": "http://www.businessinsurance.com/assets/rwd/bi-logo-footer.png", "description": "Rigorous testing and an emphasis on simplicity helped several state-run health insurance exchanges avoid many problems that bedeviled the launch of the federal government's exchange.Excluding Medicaid enrollments, public health insurance marketplaces operated by 14 states and the District of...", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui", "title": "State-run health insurance exchanges see successful enrollments - Business Insurance"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdad2e\"", "article_summary": "Rigorous testing and an emphasis on simplicity helped several state-run health insurance exchanges avoid many problems that bedeviled the launch of the federal government's exchange.\nTesting of the states' insurance exchanges, by contrast, began as early as April 2013.\n\u201cOur system is very simple,\u201d said Carrie Banahan, executive director of Kynect, Kentucky's public insurance exchange.\nBy contrast, the federal exchange, Healthcare.gov, initially required users to register prior to gaining access to eligibility and plan information.\nOne common refrain among state exchange officials was the importance of simplicity in their marketplaces' operational structure and online user interface."}
