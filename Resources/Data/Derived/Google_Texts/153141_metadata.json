Bernie Sanders, also sent her daughter Chelsea through the Sunshine state last week to rally support.\n\nIn Tuesday\u2019s Florida Democratic contest \u2014 as opposed to those in Midwestern states Illinois, Ohio, and Missouri also voting Tuesday \u2014 the result is not much in doubt. Florida\u2019s older electorate and closed primary system appears poised to catapult the former Secretary of State to an easy victory.\n\nA week after the stinging defeat in Michigan, though, the Clinton campaign was taking no chances. Bill Clinton proved an effective surrogate for U.S. Rep. Gwen Graham when he stumped for her at FAMU in 2014, and he\u2019s probably the most popular national political figure to Florida residents.\n\nThe 42nd president by and large gave Sanders the silent treatment, at least in name. But in praising his spouse\u2019s extensive governmental experience and \u201cchange-making\u201d abilities, he nonetheless attempted to draw a sharp contrast between Clinton and the 74-year-old independent senator.\n\nBill Clinton obviated Sanders\u2019 criticisms of Hillary Clinton\u2019s votes on issues such as the Iraq War authorization by saying \u201cevery election should be about the future,\u201d a motif that harked back to his 1992 campaign stop musical staple, \u201cDon\u2019t Stop Thinking About Tomorrow\u201d by Fleetwood Mac.\n\nHe outlined Secretary Clinton\u2019s history of work on progressive issues such as health care and criminal justice, particularly her work with the late Sen. Ted Kennedy in crafting the popular Children\u2019s Health Care Program. She also worked on expanding access to the courts for rural Arkansans by forming the first legal aid program in the Ozarks region.\n\nClinton also continued to press his wife\u2019s theme of binding her success to that of President Barack Obama, perhaps the only national figure more famous on FAMU\u2019s campus.\n\nIn tacit response to Sander\u2019s well-worn trope that it\u2019s \u201ctoo late for establishment politics and establishment economics,\u201d Clinton said \u201cit\u2019s time to finish the job, not reinvent the wheel,\u201d citing an improving economy.\n\nThe former president also repeated criticisms Hillary Clinton leveled at Florida\u2019s Republican-led state government, criticizing its controversial Stand Your Ground policy and rebuking its refusal to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nMost public polls show Clinton beating Sanders in the Florida primary by 25 points or more. Both candidates\u2019 campaigns have opened field offices in Tallahassee in recent weeks.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Florida Politics", "description": "Former President\u00a0Bill Clinton\u00a0paid a visit to the state capital Monday afternoon to campaign for his wife at the nation\u2019s largest historically black college,\u00a0Florida A&M University.
