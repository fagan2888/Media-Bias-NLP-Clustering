( Eric Hunsaker via Flickr )\n\nRoughly 350 drop-off sites in California will take consumers\u2019 unwanted or unused medications on Saturday and properly dispose of them.\n\nIt\u2019s part of an annual nationwide event Saturday called the 10th annual National Prescription Drug Take-Back Day, organized by the federal Drug Enforcement Administration and involving hundreds of police stations across California as well as a large number of Kaiser Permanente medical offices. (Look up a collection site near you.)\n\nIt\u2019s one of several efforts statewide to control misuse and abuse of prescription medication.\n\n\u201cWhen left laying around, too often unused medications get into the hands of seniors, children and others, and usually those medications are expired or no longer being taken,\u201d said Steve Gray, a Kaiser Permanente pharmacist and KP\u2019s pharmacy professional affairs leader for California.\n\n\u201cThe most important part of this [effort] is public safety,\u201d Gray said, \u201cso people don\u2019t hurt themselves or hurt others.\u201d\n\nSeniors sometimes self-prescribe with leftover medications, he said, or they give them to other seniors. Children can take them by accident, or drug abusers can steal them.\n\nAs part of his job, Gray travels around the state to counties that are considering ordinances to require drug manufacturers to take back unused and unwanted prescription medications.\n\nSo far, at least four counties have adopted these rules and another seven to 10 counties are considering legislation, Gray said. He said he\u2019s meeting with Los Angeles County officials on Monday to help shape their take-back policy.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing at the state or federal level to deal with this so the counties are trying to do what they can through their ordinances. It gets difficult if each of the 58 counties have a different program. So I try to help identify best practices so [the ordinances] are the same,\u201d Gray said.\n\nThere are a couple of other ways to keep prescription medications from piling up, he said:\n\nSmall initial quantity. Instead of prescribing a drug for the first time for a full course of a month or even three months, Gray said there\u2019s an effort underway to start with a smaller amount. \u201cThe provider doesn\u2019t know what will be tolerated by you, and doesn\u2019t know whether it\u2019s going to work,\u201d Gray said, \u201cso let\u2019s start out with a small quantity that would be a good test of whether it might work or not first.\u201d\n\nInstead of prescribing a drug for the first time for a full course of a month or even three months, Gray said there\u2019s an effort underway to start with a smaller amount. \u201cThe provider doesn\u2019t know what will be tolerated by you, and doesn\u2019t know whether it\u2019s going to work,\u201d Gray said, \u201cso let\u2019s start out with a small quantity that would be a good test of whether it might work or not first.\u201d Mail-back envelopes. Many retail drug stores now sell pre-paid unused-medication envelopes, to more easily dispose of unwanted prescription drugs. \u201cThe envelopes are approved by the federal government,\u201d Gray said. \u201cThat is probably the most convenient at this point.\u201d\n\nOpioids are the most-misused and dangerous medication, he said, but they\u2019re not the only ones that can be deadly.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just one category,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can really hurt yourself with opioids, but many times people think, \u2018I have diabetes, too,\u2019 and they can kill themselves by taking someone else\u2019s diabetes medication.\u201d\n\nGray said his own parents lived through the Great Depression, \u201cand they don\u2019t like to see anything thrown away,\u201d he said. \u201cThey think, \u2018Maybe someday I\u2019ll need that.\u2019 This is a real problem with seniors.\u201d\n\nDavid Gorn is a senior reporter with California Healthline.", "article_metadata": {"description": "350 drop-off sites in California will take your unwanted or unused medications on Saturday and properly dispose of them.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"National Drug Take-Back Day Is Saturday; 350 California Sites\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2015\\/09\\/25\\/national-drug-take-back-day-is-saturday-350-california-sites\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-09-25 12:15:58\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-09-25 12:15:58\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":83815,\"author_id\":\"8344\",\"author_name\":\"State of Health\",\"author_display_name\":\"State of Health\",\"tags\":[\"News\",\"Prescription Drugs\"],\"categories\":[],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2015\\/09\\/5559700298_8070e3018b_o-e1443208143973.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "350 drop-off sites in California will take your unwanted or unused medications on Saturday and properly dispose of them.", "title": "National Drug Take-Back Day Is Saturday; 350 California Sites", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2015/09/25/national-drug-take-back-day-is-saturday-350-california-sites/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2015/09/5559700298_8070e3018b_o-1440x1080.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "news,prescription drugs", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "It\u2019s part of an annual nationwide event Saturday called the 10th annual National Prescription Drug Take-Back Day, organized by the federal Drug Enforcement Administration and involving hundreds of police stations across California as well as a large number of Kaiser Permanente medical offices.\nThere are a couple of other ways to keep prescription medications from piling up, he said:Small initial quantity.\nMany retail drug stores now sell pre-paid unused-medication envelopes, to more easily dispose of unwanted prescription drugs.\n( Eric Hunsaker via Flickr )Roughly 350 drop-off sites in California will take consumers\u2019 unwanted or unused medications on Saturday and properly dispose of them.\nAs part of his job, Gray travels around the state to counties that are considering ordinances to require drug manufacturers to take back unused and unwanted prescription medications."}
