Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) is in an unenviable spot. Few congressional Republicans are as vulnerable in 2016 as the far-right Wisconsinite; he hasn’t developed much of a legislative record; and polls show him trailing former Sen. Russ Feingold (D) in next year’s rematch.

Johnson also referred during a recent radio interview to “ idiot inner-city kids ,” though he later said he was being sarcastic.

Yesterday, however, American Bridge released a new video with a recent Ron Johnson quote that stood out as especially interesting.

“I think what’s resonating about Donald Trump, I’d like to think, some things is appealing about my candidacy here in Wisconsin.”

Obviously, the grammar and syntax are a mess, but the point seems clear enough: Johnson apparently sees himself in the Trump-esque mold.

This isn’t a positive development – for the senator or his party.

At a certain level, perhaps this was inevitable. When one candidate rockets to the top of state and national Republican polling, it stands to reason that some GOP candidates, especially those facing tough re-election fights, would effectively tell voters, “Hey, I’m just like that guy!”

For Johnson, in particular, this must be especially tempting, since the far-right senator has a habit of making some pretty embarrassing comments. Why say, “I’m a clumsy, undisciplined politician,” when you can say, “I’m appealing in the same way Donald Trump is”?

But this is a risky strategy. Trump, a deeply unpopular national figure, is already dominating the Republican conversation in ridiculous ways, and he’s even had some influence over the GOP’s policy agenda.
