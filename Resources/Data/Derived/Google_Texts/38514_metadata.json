Users can join for free and don\u2019t have to be American Express members.\n\nCustomers will be able to accumulate points through purchases at Enterprise Rent-A-Car, Rite Aid, Macy\u2019s and a number of other companies, which can then be used for discounts at any participating vendor. Plenti points built up by buying gas or a Nationwide insurance policy, for example, could earn discounts on an electric bill from Direct Energy or milk from Rite Aid.\n\n\u201cIt will really be the first time where U.S. consumers, on a single program, can take the rewards they\u2019ve earned in one industry and take it to another,\u201d said Abeer Bhatia, chief executive of US Loyalty at American Express.\n\nLoyalty programs aim to keep customers coming back by allowing them to earn points toward discounts or other rewards. But these programs are often tied to one or two retailers and limited in how they can be used.\n\nPlenti\u2019s program is straightforward. A customer signs up at a participating merchant, on the Plenti app for smartphones, or on Plenti.com. Every time a customer spends money, either cash or by using a debit or credit card, they will earn \u201cPlenti Points\u201d after giving their Plenti account number. The number of points a customer earns on a transaction will vary from merchant to merchant.\n\nPlenti Points can be redeemed in 1,000-point increments for $10 in savings, so 1,000 points earned at Exxon could be used for $10 in savings at Macy\u2019s or RiteAid.\n\nPlenti is part of American Express\u2019 push to broaden its reach of customers, which have traditionally been the affluent, the well-traveled and people who have a lot of business expenses. American Express lost its exclusive deal with Costco in January, which was considered a major blow to the company. JetBlue is also reportedly planning on ending its relationship with AmEx later this year.", "article_metadata": {"description": "AmEx to roll out loyalty program Plenti on Monday", "title": "AmEx to roll out loyalty program Plenti on Monday", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "AmEx to roll out loyalty program Plenti on Monday", "title": "AmEx to roll out loyalty program Plenti on Monday", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/03/amex_to_roll_out_loyalty_program_plenti_on_monday/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/american-express-loyalty-program.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "AmEx to roll out loyalty program Plenti on Monday", "title": "AmEx to roll out loyalty program Plenti on Monday", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/american-express-loyalty-program.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Ken Sweet", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1691\"", "article_summary": "Unlike other loyalty programs, such as frequent flyer plans, Plenti isn\u2019t tied to a single company or credit card issuer.\nEvery time a customer spends money, either cash or by using a debit or credit card, they will earn \u201cPlenti Points\u201d after giving their Plenti account number.\nLoyalty programs aim to keep customers coming back by allowing them to earn points toward discounts or other rewards.\nAmerican Express lost its exclusive deal with Costco in January, which was considered a major blow to the company.\nUsers can join for free and don\u2019t have to be American Express members."}
