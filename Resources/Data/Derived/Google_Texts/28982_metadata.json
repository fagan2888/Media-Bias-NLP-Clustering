He has suggested Congress repeal laws it never passed. He has compared net neutrality to the Affordable Care Act. He has called birth control and emergency contraception \u201cabortion-inducing drugs.\u201d The list goes on. It would seem, all too often, that the Texas GOP senator just doesn\u2019t \u201cget it.\u201d\n\nAnd yet, that might not always have been the case with regard to the crisis of sexual assaults on college campuses, which even Cruz recognized as a problem during his Princeton years. In a recent interview with Business Insider, the senator revealed himself to be a prominent anti-rape activist while he was in college, which older reports from the Princetonian corroborate.\n\n\u201cI am very worried that administration concern for external crime is replacing concern for internal crime,\u201d Cruz told the Princetonian in 1990, addressing a proposed measure to add exterior locks to campus dorms. \u201cThe greater problem is date rape, or assaults by other students, which the planned system would do nothing to stop.\u201d\n\nBusiness Insider goes on to detail Cruz\u2019s anti-rape activism, which was a focal point of his campaigns for student government:\n\nIn April 1990, Cruz ran for a position as one of 10 delegates on the student government\u2019s U Council. An ad promoting his candidacy that appeared in the Princetonian touted his work on the food and safety committees as well as his anti-rape activism. The ad noted Cruz \u201chelped implement increased safety and rape education during Freshman week\u201d and that he cosponsored a Take Back The Night march. Cruz won his race and joined the U Council. Cruz successfully ran for re-election to the U Council in 1991. His efforts to fight date rape were once again a focus of his campaign. \u201cI\u2019d like to see an increase in lighting and rape prevention education,\u201d he said in an interview with the Princetonian.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Business Insider reveals the Texas GOP senator sponsored a Take Back the Night march during his college years", "title": "Ted Cruz, Tea Party presidential hopeful and\u2026former anti-rape activist?", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Business Insider reveals the Texas GOP senator sponsored a Take Back the Night march during his college years", "title": "Ted Cruz, Tea Party presidential hopeful and\u2026former anti-rape activist?", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/12/09/ted_cruz_tea_party_presidential_hopeful_and_former_anti_rape_activist/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/gop-2016-foreign-policy-.jpeg2-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Business Insider reveals the Texas GOP senator sponsored a Take Back the Night march during his college years", "title": "Ted Cruz, Tea Party presidential hopeful and\u2026former anti-rape activist?", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/gop-2016-foreign-policy-.jpeg2-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@@JennyKutner", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Jenny Kutner", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, anti-rape campaign, Business Insider, campus sexual assault crisis, military sexual assault, Rape, Sexual assault, Take Back the Night, Tea Party, Ted Cruz", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9f51\"", "article_summary": "Topics: anti-rape campaign, Business Insider, campus sexual assault crisis, military sexual assault, Rape, Sexual assault, Take Back the Night, Tea Party, Ted Cruz, News, Politics NewsTed Cruz has said and done many things that make him sound not smart.\n\u201cI\u2019d like to see an increase in lighting and rape prevention education,\u201d he said in an interview with the Princetonian.\nIn a recent interview with Business Insider, the senator revealed himself to be a prominent anti-rape activist while he was in college, which older reports from the Princetonian corroborate.\nThe ad noted Cruz \u201chelped implement increased safety and rape education during Freshman week\u201d and that he cosponsored a Take Back The Night march.\nAn ad promoting his candidacy that appeared in the Princetonian touted his work on the food and safety committees as well as his anti-rape activism."}
