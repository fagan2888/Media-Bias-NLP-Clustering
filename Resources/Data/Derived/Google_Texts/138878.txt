Daily Show segments like this thoroughly bum me out, but at the same time I can’t resist Jon Stewart equal opportunity tearing into everyone for being lying assholes, so here you go. Just consider yourself warned that side effects include cavernous pits of hopelessness.

The moral of the story is that taking a stance on the Affordable Care Act — one way or the other — is the anti-sodium pentothal. It just magically turns you into a “lying motherf*cker” who can’t help him or herself from setting your pants on fire even when it’s not at all necessary. This is exactly why I never take a stance on anything other than everyone being terrible.
