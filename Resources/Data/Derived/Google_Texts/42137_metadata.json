Also, they\u2019re pretty desperate for good ratings.\n\nDemocratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, hasn\u2019t gotten a lot of attention lately, that doesn\u2019t mean she hasn\u2019t been making news. Here are few Hillary headlines you might have missed during the media\u2019s most recent Trumpgasm.\n\n1.\n\nSenate investigators have asked the State Department for backup copies of emails sent by Bryan Magliano, the guy Hillary hired to maintain her secret email server, and has since pled the Fifth in response to the ongoing federal investigations. The State Department, however, just told those investigator that they couldn\u2019t find any copies of those emails. The FBI, which has taken possession of Pagliano\u2019s government computer, might have better luck.\n\n2.\n\nJust another run-of-the-mill story about nepotism/corruption involving Hillary Clinton and Goldman Sachs, her favorite Wall Street bank:\n\nAs secretary of state, Hillary Clinton intervened in a request forwarded by her son-in-law on behalf of a deep-sea mining firm to meet with her or other State Department officials, according to the recently released Clinton emails. One of the firm\u2019s investors had asked Clinton\u2019s son-in-law, Marc Mezvinsky, who is married to Chelsea Clinton, for help setting up such contacts, the emails show.\n\nMezvinsky passed along the request on behalf of his former employer, Goldman Sachs, which was representing the mining firm Neptune in its effort to lobby for Senate approval of the Law of the Seas Treaty. Clinton forwarded the email to her aide Tom Nides, a former (and current) Morgan Stanley executive. The Clinton campaign refused to respond to multiple requests for comment from the Associated Press. A watchdog group has asked the U.S. Office of Government Ethics to investigate.\n\n3.\n\nHillary Clinton has repeatedly insisted that she never (sent or) received information on her private email server that was classified (at the time). The intelligence community rejects that assessment, which Hillary has dismissed as a \u201cdisagreement\u201d between government agencies. Fox News reports on a new development that undermines Hillary\u2019s case:\n\nAn intelligence community review has re-affirmed that two classified emails were indeed \u201ctop secret\u201d when they hit Hillary Clinton\u2019s unsecured personal server despite a challenge to that designation by the State Department, according to two sources familiar with the review. The sources described the dispute over whether the two emails were classified at the highest level as a \u201csettled matter.\u201d\n\nPerhaps one of these stories will come up at the next Democratic primary debate, which takes place this Saturday, at night, during an NFL game.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "Former Republican frontrunner Donald Trump\u00a0has been absolutely dominating the media's coverage of the 2016 presidential race, mostly\u00a0because his comments\u00a0allow\u00a0pundits to courageously\u00a0take a stan", "title": "Three Hillary Clinton Stories You Probably Missed Thanks to the Media\u2019s Obsession With Donald Trump", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/blog/donald-trump-winner/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Hillary-Clinton-150x150.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Former Republican frontrunner Donald Trump\u00a0has been absolutely dominating the media's coverage of t", "creator": "@AndrewStilesUSA", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Hillary-Clinton-150x150.jpg", "title": "Three Hillary Clinton Stories You Probably Missed Thanks to the Media\u2019s Obsession With Donald Trump", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID", "pages": 282024895179874}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, hasn\u2019t gotten a lot of attention lately, that doesn\u2019t mean she hasn\u2019t been making news.\nHillary Clinton has repeatedly insisted that she never (sent or) received information on her private email server that was classified (at the time).\nJust another run-of-the-mill story about nepotism/corruption involving Hillary Clinton and Goldman Sachs, her favorite Wall Street bank:As secretary of state, Hillary Clinton intervened in a request forwarded by her son-in-law on behalf of a deep-sea mining firm to meet with her or other State Department officials, according to the recently released Clinton emails.\nThe State Department, however, just told those investigator that they couldn\u2019t find any copies of those emails.\nHere are few Hillary headlines you might have missed during the media\u2019s most recent Trumpgasm."}
