While the stories are both sobering and inspiring, all of them point to a need for solid answers to a problem that presents itself in seemingly endless permutations.\n\nAARP Editorial Director Myrna Blyth moderated a panel after the film, sharing viewpoints with the movie\u2019s writer-director, Larkin McPhee, and Dr. Roslyn Schneider, global patient affairs lead at Pfizer.\n\nThe discussion centered on an initiative among several counties in Ohio that created a small property tax to pay for home care for lower-income people. The $145 million raised annually helps fund a modest level of care (including Meals on Wheels and health visits from professionals) plus support programs for caregivers. In many cases, the fund can means the difference between home care and a nursing home \u2014 the latter being a more costly tab to taxpayers.\n\n\u201cThe Ohio initiative is an amazing program,\u201d Blyth said. \u201cIt seems like something that politicians would at least talk about. The fact that it saves so much money would have great appeal to people.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe results are just being publicized now,\u201d said Caring for Mom and Dad director McPhee. \u201cThe Council on Aging of Southwestern Ohio has identified the most important things: home meals and home health aides.\u201d\n\nCaring for Mom and Dad tells the history of the Ohio program, which had its beginnings more than 25 years ago as the brainchild of an activist named Lois Brown Dale.\n\n\u201cI find it interesting,\u201d Blyth observed, \u201cthat it was started by one woman. It almost reminds me of the story of Ethel Percy Andrus, the woman who started AARP. She was one woman, an educator, who saw a need of older people not being cared for.\n\n\u201cWhat one person can do is really remarkable.\u201d\n\nPhoto: Bill Newcott", "article_metadata": {"page_title": "blog", "twitter": {"description": "As 75 million boomers march steadily toward old age, a health care problem of monumental proportions awaits.
