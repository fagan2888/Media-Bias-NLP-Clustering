Guest host Stephen Colbert presents stories with anarchists and oddballs by John Sayles and George Saunders. In Sayles's "At the Anarchists' Convention," fierce old lefties fight everything from the fruit cup to the manager at their annual banquet. In "The Falls," two inadequate men are faced with the same crisis.
