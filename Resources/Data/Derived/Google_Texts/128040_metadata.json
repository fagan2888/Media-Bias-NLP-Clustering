That\u2019s why the CFO should be part of the team when a hospital is putting together its Ebola response plan.\u201d\n\nMost hospitals already have in place plans to cope with disasters such as tornadoes and plane crashes, said Seng, a former registered nurse. Ebola presents a challenge different than treating multiple victims of accidents or natural disasters, however, because it requires intense and expensive efforts to prevent the disease from infecting medical staff and the general population.\n\nThe vast majority of Ebola cases reported since the latest outbreak began nearly a year ago have been in West Africa. But a handful of cases in the U.S. since September 30 have alarmed the public, made Ebola a major political issue in the recent election, and presented hospitals and other medical facilities with serious challenges and decisions.\n\n[See also: Ebola opens up health workforce rift.]\n\nDoing nothing, Seng said, is not a viable option.\n\n\u201cIt would be fiscally irresponsible at this point in time for a hospital CFO to think, \u2018I can deal with this if it happens,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThey have to have a proactive plan in place now, so that when a patient walks into their emergency department, they can provide services for that patient as well as protect the staff and community from further exposure.\u201d\n\nOperational expenses\n\nThe first step a hospital must take in developing an Ebola response plan is to determine what level of treatment it should provide. The majority of hospitals will act as initial treatment centers, with a minority serving as specialized facilities for Ebola patients.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re starting to see across the country where patients are going to be clustered into certain facilities that are ramped up and prepared,\u201d Seng said.\n\nIn early November, for example, the Virginia Hospital and Healthcare Association announced that UVA Medical Center and VCU Medical Center would serve as designated Ebola treatment facilities in that state. And a half-dozen hospitals in Massachusetts agreed in late October to serve as Ebola specialty centers, electing to spread the burden of space, staff and cost requirements.\n\nEven hospitals that aren\u2019t specialty centers should expect to incur Ebola-related expenses. In announcing the Massachusetts plan, public health commissioner Cheryl Bartlett said \u201ceach of the state\u2019s hospitals and their emergency departments are prepared to screen, identify, and isolate any suspect cases and coordinate with [the state Health Department] on risk assessment and patient transfers, as needed.\u201d\n\nThat means extra costs for training and equipment, even if a hospital never sees an Ebola patient.\n\n\u201cA lot of hospitals are having practice drills around what happens if a patient comes into their hospital,\u201d said Heather Delgado, another attorney in Barnes & Thornburg\u2019s health practice who works with hospitals, health systems and other healthcare providers. \u201cThat\u2019s an expense.\u201d\n\n[See also: Texas Health Presbyterian takes financial hit after Ebola crisis.]\n\nHaving the proper equipment for handling an Ebola patient, protecting staff and other patients at the hospital, and disinfecting facilities is another major cost.\n\n\u201cMoney will have to be spent on personal protective equipment,\u201d Delgado said. \u201cThe protective equipment recommended by the CDC are these airtight suits, and from what I understand they are extremely hot and can be worn only for two to four hours at a time. So some hospitals had to buy extra underwear, socks and boots in multiple sizes so people could strip out of these heavy-duty suits, and then everything they had underneath has to be thrown away and replaced.\u201d\n\nEquipment involved in transporting an Ebola patient also may have to be replaced.\n\n\u201cIf an Ebola patient comes in by ambulance, a lot of times they\u2019re getting rid of gurney mattresses, blankets, pillows, and anything else that\u2019s contaminated by that patient,\u201d Delgado said. \u201cSo material that normally could be re-used and sanitized is being thrown out and replaced. If you\u2019re taking care of an Ebola patient around the clock, supply costs could be millions of dollars.\u201d\n\nThe additional labor costs extend well beyond initial training.\n\nThe physician/nurse staffing ratio to take care of an Ebola patient is a lot higher.\n\n\u201cThe patient doesn\u2019t come in with a big sign that says, \u2018I think I have Ebola,\u2019\" Seng said. \u201cSo you may have several staff members exposed to that patient before a diagnosis is made. Now you have staff replacement costs for those staff members who have been exposed, because those staffers are going to be taken offline. And so you\u2019re going to have duplicate staffing costs.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe physician/nurse staffing ratio to take care of an Ebola patient is a lot higher, so that\u2019s extra labor you\u2019ll have to account for,\u201d Delgado said. \u201cNursing overtime is another huge labor cost. CFOs should be looking now to build those labor and supply costs in their budget.\u201d\n\nHospitals treating one or more Ebola patients also should expect to spend money on communications and specialized clean-up services.\n\n\u201cHospitals are going to have to inform the public as well as their own staff about what\u2019s going on, so they might need to hire an outside agency with experience in dealing with media communication,\u201d Delgado said. \u201cAs for cleaning, we\u2019re talking about specialized cleaning companies coming in that can disinfect everything. It\u2019s very expensive.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/cfo-and-ebola-anticipating-expenses", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/hazmat%20suit%20black%20and%20white%20ebola.jpg", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Most hospitals already have in place plans to cope with disasters such as tornadoes and plane crashes, but the Ebola virus presents a different challenge.
