But as Human Rights Watch\u2019s Antonio Ginatta noted, \u201cnow we\u2019re in the thousands.\u201d\n\nIt started last summer, when large numbers of families fleeing violence in Central America started crossing over into the United States. The Obama administration opened a facility in Artesia, New Mexico, to detain these families; after controversy, that facility was closed and a new one operated by CCA opened in Dilley, Texas, with a capacity of 2,400 beds.\n\nWoodruff notes that CCA\u2019s quarterly report shows its profits in the second quarter of 2015 were $49 million higher than the same period in 2014, largely due to the expansion in detaining migrant families. The Dilley facility alone generated $36 million in revenue during the quarter.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Corrections Corporation of America rakes in tens of millions of dollars through so-called \"family detention\"", "title": "The private prison company getting rich locking up migrant children", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The Corrections Corporation of America rakes in tens of millions of dollars through so-called \"family detention\"", "title": "The private prison company getting rich locking up migrant children", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/09/12/the_private_prison_company_thats_getting_rich_locking_up_migrant_kids_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/03/iStock_000021005318Medium-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Corrections Corporation of America rakes in tens of millions of dollars through so-called \"family detention\"", "title": "The private prison company getting rich locking up migrant children", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/03/iStock_000021005318Medium-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Zaid Jilani", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, AlterNet, Central America, Immigration, New Mexico, Prison", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1f12\"", "article_summary": "Woodruff notes that before last summer, there was virtually no \u201cfamily detention,\u201d referring to the detention of migrant families crossing the border, children included, in U.S. immigrant detention facilities.\nBut as Human Rights Watch\u2019s Antonio Ginatta noted, \u201cnow we\u2019re in the thousands.\u201dIt started last summer, when large numbers of families fleeing violence in Central America started crossing over into the United States.\nThe Dilley facility alone generated $36 million in revenue during the quarter.\nWoodruff notes that CCA\u2019s quarterly report shows its profits in the second quarter of 2015 were $49 million higher than the same period in 2014, largely due to the expansion in detaining migrant families.\nThe Obama administration opened a facility in Artesia, New Mexico, to detain these families; after controversy, that facility was closed and a new one operated by CCA opened in Dilley, Texas, with a capacity of 2,400 beds."}
