TIPTON, Ind. (AP) - General Electric says a wind turbine that lost one of its blades this week at a central Indiana wind farm may have been struck by lightning.

The company, which makes the blades, says in a statement early signs point to lightning as the reason a turbine in Tipton County lost one of its three blades Wednesday night.

The Kokomo Tribune reports (http://bit.ly/1fVEKRy ) GE says it will assign a team to perform a thorough investigation to identify the root cause of the malfunction.

Wednesday’s blade separation was the second time in two months a blade has fallen from one of the Wildcat Wind Farm’s 125 wind turbines since the site went online in December 2012.

Part of a blade also separated Feb. 1 from one of the farm’s turbines near Windfall.
