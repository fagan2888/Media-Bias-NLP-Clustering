Rand Paul argued Sunday.\n\nThe Kentucky Republican said if Democrats end up insisting on increasing spending limits as part of a deal to raise the debt ceiling and end the government shutdown, then it will be considered a \u201cnonstarter\u201d by Senate Republicans.\n\n\n\nFollow @politicalticker Follow @KilloughCNN\n\nIn an interview on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d Paul said \u201cthe one thing\u201d he cannot accept - as Congress negotiates a deal to halt current stalemates over the budget and national debt - is to exceed the spending caps put into place by a series of forced budget cuts, known in Washington as the sequester.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s funny, (Democrats are) all about Obamacare being the law of the land, but so is the sequester,\u201d he told CNN chief political correspondent Candy Crowley.\n\n'Cordial' shutdown talks under way in Senate\n\nWhile the cuts went into place earlier this year, a second round is scheduled to take effect in January unless there is some agreement on spending on Capitol Hill.\n\nBut Paul, a potential 2016 presidential candidate, said the current spending limits from the sequester are needed to help bring fiscal responsibility to the nation\u2019s capital.\n\n\u201cIf we get rid of that, it's a terrible step in the wrong direction,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that a possible proposal to exceed sequester level spending caps would be a new change in policy for Senate Democrats, who have been pushing for a debt ceiling bill with no strings attached. The Treasury Department says it will be unable to pay the government's bills unless the debt limit is increased by Thursday.\n\n\u201cWe're seeing that the Senate Democrats are getting greedy about this whole thing,\u201d he said.\n\nPaul said he doesn't think it's a good idea to pass the deadline, but he also argued the president was taking a drastic approach in his warnings about a possible default.\n\n\"It's irresponsible for him to scare people,\" he said. \"He should be the opposite. The leader of the country should be soothing the markets and saying we will always pay the interest on our debt.\"\n\nThe White House has repeatedly warned of the potential consequences of passing the deadline to raise the debt limit. Last week, Obama accused Republicans of saying if they don\u2019t get \u201c100% of their way\u201d in the current negotiations, \u201cthey are going to default on America\u2019s debt so that America for the first time in history does not pay its bills.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is not something I will do,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to establish that pattern.\u201d\n\nBut Paul argued the country has enough money to pay the interest on its debt and \u201cthere\u2019s absolutely no reason ever to default, and a good leader would be saying we will never default.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot raising the debt ceiling means you have to balance your budget,\u201d he added. \u201cIt doesn't mean you have to default.\u201d\n\nOne Democratic leadership aide told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash that Democrats are not trying to move the spending levels as a condition to reopening the government in the short term (now through the end of the year). But if Republicans and Democrats end up sitting down for a long-term budget deal after the government opens and after the debt ceiling is raised, then a provision to get rid of the spending limits may become part of those separate talks, the aide said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Updated 2:32 p.m. ET, 10/13/2013 Washington (CNN) \u2013 President Barack Obama should not be using scare tactics as the government approaches a deadline to raise the federal debt ceiling, Sen.
