The man said he didn\u2019t have any money and kept walking.\n\nHe was struck from behind and fell down next to a parked BMW.\n\n\u201cThe suspect then kicked and stomped on the victim\u2019s face,\u201d according to court papers. \u201cThe victim sustained a broken nose in two places and other injuries to his face and neck.\u201d\n\nAfter Aleamotua fled, police said, a witness who had seen him making \u201ckicking and stomping motions\u201d next to the car \u201cheard moaning and found the victim collapsed on the ground.\u201d\n\nThe witness told police he had seen the assailant put his hand on the roof of the BMW during the attack.\n\nAn ID tech with the Berkeley Police Department dusted the BMW for fingerprints, and an analysis later determined that one of the prints matched Aleamotua\u2019s thumb.\n\nThe victim did not pick out Aleamotua during a photo line-up with police, however.\n\nOn May 28, police sought a warrant for Aleamotua\u2019s arrest. Police located him the next day and took him into custody, according to court papers.\n\n\u201cWhen Siaosi was told he was identified as the person that assaulted the victim, Siaosi did not deny it and shortly thereafter invoked his right to an attorney,\u201d wrote Sgt. Peter Hong in court documents obtained by Berkeleyside from the Alameda County district attorney\u2019s office.\n\nOn June 1, the district attorney\u2019s office charged Aleamotua with felony battery with serious bodily injury and elder abuse, which is also a felony.\n\nAccording to court papers, Aleamotua was convicted in March 2011 of felony robbery in Alameda County. It counted as a strike against him and he was sentenced to prison.\n\nIn August 2012, Aleamotua was convicted of receiving stolen property, also a felony, and was sent to prison in that case, too. He had another brush with the law that same year, according to the San Francisco Chronicle, after being arrested in connection with Occupy Oakland protests that saw 39 people taken into custody.\n\nAleamotua was also arrested in Berkeley\u2019s Constitution Square in August 2013 after he reportedly picked up a wooden object and struck a 28-year-old street vendor who refused to give him a percentage of his earnings.\n\nAleamotua is scheduled for a procedural hearing Thursday, July 30, at the Rene C. Davidson Courthouse in Oakland. He is being held at Santa Rita Jail with a bail of $260,000, but is not eligible for bail because he violated the terms of his parole, according to Alameda County sheriff\u2019s department records posted online.\n\nGet the latest Berkeley news in your inbox with Berkeleyside\u2019s free Daily Briefing.
