Those ancestors probably made theirs by dropping fire-heated rocks into the stomachs of whatever animals they managed to kill. The subsequent invention of the pot made soups, stocks and broths staples in virtually every corner of the culinary world.\n\nRecently, this prehistoric food has improbably become a trend beverage, ranking with green juice and coconut water as the next magic potion in the eternal quest for perfect health. Like other health foods that have taken off in recent years \u2014 yogurt, quinoa \u2014 broth combines mystical connections to the ancient world and demonstrable nutrition benefits in the modern one.\n\n\u201cI would never have thought I\u2019d be the person who makes homemade stock,\u201d said Tam, who now saves bones from grass-fed beef and frequently produces batches of stock in her pressure cooker. She used to grab a box of shelf-stable stock when making soup or stew, figuring that organic was a good substitute for homemade. Now, she\u2019s a convert to the real thing: the clear, bright, essential flavor that only fresh stock, made from high-quality ingredients, can provide.\n\n\u201cJust because something is organic doesn\u2019t mean it has the nutrition we\u2019re looking for,\u201d Tam said. \u201cOr that it\u2019s delicious.\u201d\n\nThe difference between stock and broth is elusive in the bowl but clearer in the kitchen. Many people use the terms interchangeably, but strictly speaking, both broth and stock include bones and meat, but stock has a higher proportion of bones to meat.\n\nAnd to those who have taken up \u201cbrothing,\u201d it is the content of the bones \u2014 including collagen, amino acids and minerals \u2014 that is the source of its health benefits. Extracting the nutrients from bones is accomplished through long cooking and by adding some acid to the pot, like vinegar, wine or a bit of tomato paste, which loosens and dissolves the tough bits.\n\nNourishing bone broth has even begun to replace espresso and chai in the to-go cups of the millions of Americans who have at least attempted the Paleo diet. (Coffee and tea, along with dairy products, legumes and grains, are forbidden.) \u201cWhen you talk to chefs about this, everyone\u2019s head is exploding,\u201d said chef Marco Canora, who has just opened Brodo, a storefront window in the East Village attached to his restaurant, Hearth, where three flavorful broths are dispensed in paper cups. Like an espresso drink, the broths at Brodo can be customized, with add-ins like grated fresh turmeric, housemade chili oil and bone marrow from grass-fed cattle, which transforms plainly delicious broth into a richly satisfying snack.\n\n\u201cEvery chef knows how to make stock; everyone uses it as an ingredient; but it would never occur to anyone that you could sell it,\u201d he said.\n\nBut right now, it seems, you can. Belcampo, the year-old meat company that sells pasture-fed beef from cattle raised on its own ranch in Northern California, just started serving $3.50 cups of house-made bone broth as a side dish in its five butcher shop-restaurants. Online sources have sprung up to meet demand, selling frozen bone broth by the quart or by subscription.\n\nFROM BREAD TO BONE\n\nCanora turned to broth after he adopted a modified Paleo diet about five years ago, when at age 40 he found himself depressed, prediabetic, overweight and showing early signs of gout.\n\n\u201cFor 20 years, I smoked, I drank my face off, and 80 percent of my diet was bread and butter,\u201d he said. Like many chefs, he ate mostly standing up, late at night, and with an eye to consuming as many fatty pork products as possible.\n\n\u201cTwenty years ago, if you talked about health and wellness in chef circles, they would laugh you out of town,\u201d he said. Now, chefs are beginning to understand that food has to be more than just delicious, he said.\n\nAfter a bout of nutritional consultations, he emerged clutching a list of forbidden foods longer than he\u2019d imagined possible.\n\n\u201cBroth was always my comfort food,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead of sipping coffee all day and wine all night, I started walking around with cups of broth, and that\u2019s where the idea for Brodo came from.\u201d\n\nBut most \u201cbroth-ers\u201d are not chefs who happen to have homemade stocks sitting around. They are conscious eaters who have stumbled onto what generations of cooks in other cuisines have long known: Broth made with plenty of bones contributes to well-being in ways that other foods don\u2019t.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been known through history and across cultures that broth settles your stomach and also your nerves,\u201d said Sally Fallon Morell, an author of the new book \u201cNourishing Broth.\u201d \u201cWhen a recipe has that much tradition behind it, I believe the science is there too.\u201d\n\nMany Asian cuisines have a version of Long Life Broth, often a combination of whole birds and fresh or dried shellfish, with bones, feet and shells contributing their nutrients to the pot.\n\nIn the 12th century, the \u201cJewish penicillin\u201d clich\u00e9 was born when the physician Maimonides wrote that chicken soup \u201cis recommended as an excellent food as well as medication.\u201d\n\nIn the Caribbean, \u201ccow foot soup,\u201d rich with collagen, is eaten as a strengthening breakfast and for all sorts of ailments.\n\nKorean seolleongtang and Japanese tonkotsu are broths that are thick and creamy with fats and myoglobin from bone marrow. In France, there are strict separations among stocks \u2014 light veal, dark veal, raw chicken, roasted chicken \u2014 but all of them are ideally of a perfect clarity, clear enough to read the date on a coin at the bottom of the pot, according to French tradition.\n\nBut there is no need to be that picky, or to be on the Paleo diet, to appreciate a good broth. Making one is as easy as getting your hands on fresh, meaty bones \u2014 preferably including some knuckles or necks or another cartilaginous part \u2014 then covering them with water and simmering them patiently until the broth tastes good to you.\n\nMeat and poultry can go in the same pot (delicious batches of the stuff arise from such combinations). Aromatics are optional.\n\nA steady stream of customers lined up at the Brodo window on a recent raw, wet afternoon, sipping and tasting, and somewhat dumbfounded that such a basic food could taste so good.\n\n\u201cMy grandmother used to drink a jelly glass of chicken broth every day, even when it was broiling hot outside,\u201d said Carl Hoffman, who stopped in on his way home from work. Estelle Hoffman lived to be 106, he said: \u201cShe called it her fountain of youth.\u201d\n\nBEEF BONE BROTH\n\nIngredients\n\n1 1/2 pounds bone-in beef short rib, 2 1/2 pounds beef shank or oxtail, 2 pounds beef knucklebones or neck bones, or a combination of both (or add 1 more pound beef shank or oxtail)\n\n2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil\n\n2 tablespoons tomato paste\n\n1/4 cup apple cider vinegar\n\n3 carrots, peeled and coarsely chopped\n\n3 celery stalks, coarsely chopped\n\n2 onions, halved and peeled\n\n1 (14 1/2- ounce) can tomatoes (they can be whole, peeled or diced)\n\n1 head garlic, excess skins removed, top chopped off to expose the cloves\n\n2 bay leaves\n\n1 bunch fresh flat-leaf parsley\n\n1/2 bunch fresh thyme\n\n1/4 ounce dried shiitake mushrooms\n\n1 tablespoon black peppercorns\n\nMethod\n\nHeat oven to 350 degrees. Place meat and bones in a roasting pan or on a large rimmed baking sheet. Drizzle with olive oil, turning to coat, then brush all over with tomato paste. Roast until browned, 30 to 35 minutes. (They don\u2019t need to cook all the way through but to just develop some color.)\n\nPut roasted meat and bones in a 12-quart stockpot and add vinegar and enough cold water to cover by 3 inches (about 6 quarts). Bring to a boil, then reduce to a low simmer, uncovered, for 2 to 3 hours. While simmering, occasionally skim fat and foam from the top using a ladle.\n\nAdd all the remaining ingredients. Continue to simmer, uncovered, for at least 3 hours. If using knucklebones, simmer overnight, 9 to 15 hours, so the knucklebones have sufficient time to break down.\n\nRemove meat and bones with a slotted spoon or tongs; reserve meat for another use (such as soup). Pour broth through a fine-mesh strainer into a bowl or containers. Use immediately or cover and refrigerate up to a week, or freeze indefinitely", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2015/01/BONE_BROTH_3.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8750\"", "article_summary": "Online sources have sprung up to meet demand, selling frozen bone broth by the quart or by subscription.\nOne of the cornerstones of the diet is \u201cbone broth,\u201d the clear, concentrated meaty elixir that home cooks and chefs have known more or less forever as stock.\nNow, she\u2019s a convert to the real thing: the clear, bright, essential flavor that only fresh stock, made from high-quality ingredients, can provide.\nNourishing bone broth has even begun to replace espresso and chai in the to-go cups of the millions of Americans who have at least attempted the Paleo diet.\nMany people use the terms interchangeably, but strictly speaking, both broth and stock include bones and meat, but stock has a higher proportion of bones to meat."}
