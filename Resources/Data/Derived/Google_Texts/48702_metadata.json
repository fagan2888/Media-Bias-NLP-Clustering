Not allowing insurance companies to reject a policy owner for preexisting conditions is a good thing.\u201d\n\nReferring to the House GOP\u2019s budget proposal, which calls for a full repeal of Obamacare, Mr. Donovan said there are \u201cparts of the budget that may not be good\u201d and parts of Obamacare that may good. Mr. Donovan went on to knock the House Republican proposal for partially privatizing Medicare. (He did not criticize breaking up Medicaid into block grants for the states.)\n\n\u201cNot keeping our commitments to people we\u2019ve already shaken hands with, people who have paid into the Medicare program, people who are depending upon that\u2013we made a promise to those people and we have to keep that,\u201d he continued. \u201cIf there\u2019s any changes that would affect benefits, that should be done for future participants. Not the people we already made a commitment to.\u201d\n\nThe last representative of the open Staten Island and Brooklyn-based House seat, Republican Michael Grimm, took a much harder line against Democrats and Obamacare, calling at one point for a full repeal of the healthcare program. Mr. Donovan, who appears to be a more moderate Republican than Mr. Grimm, limited his criticisms of Obamacare to how individuals have not been able to choose their own physicians. (Mr. Grimm resigned in January following a guilty plea to a federal tax evasion charge.)\n\nBut Mr. Donovan\u2019s Democratic opponent, Councilman Vincent Gentile, ripped him yesterday for not distancing himself enough from the House Republican budget. Republicans control both chambers of Congress, though the proposal is expected meet fierce opposition from Democrats, and even some Republicans, in the House and Senate.\n\nMr. Donovan was on the campaign trail today to unveil reforms for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, under fire again for their handling of insurance claims following Hurricane Sandy. A recent \u201c60 Minutes\u201d report detailed allegations that private insurance companies denied flood insurance claims to thousands of Sandy victims due to fraudulently altered engineering reports. FEMA was not accused of fraudulence, but was responsible for overseeing the private insurers.\n\nMr. Donovan proposed a series of reforms, including a requirement that home inspections be conducted by a FEMA agent or FEMA certified engineer, and have video or photographic documentation. Mr. Donovan said homeowners should sign affidavits detailing the damage and FEMA should eliminate penalties to the insurer for \u201coverpaying,\u201d in an effort to eliminate the incentive to under report damages.\n\nThe special election will be held May 5.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.byline_name": "Ross Barkan", "sailthru.author": "Ross Barkan", "application-name": "Observer", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/20150318_101508.jpg?quality=80&w=640"}, "site": "@observer", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@Observer"}, "sailthru.article.image.header": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/20150318_101508.jpg?quality=80&w=728&h=418&crop=1", "sailthru.tags": "Affordable Care Act, Dan Donovan, Daniel Donovan, ny-11, obamacare, Staten Island, obsNews & Politics, obsPolitics", "sailthru.section": "News & Politics", "keywords": "dan donovan, fema, vincent gentile, obamacare, ny-11, staten island, annadale, michael grimm", "sailthru.article.image.grid": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/20150318_101508.jpg?quality=80&w=300&h=225&crop=1", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://observer.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/dac0f3722a48a53be75eb06c0c4f5119?s=16", "news_keywords": "dan donovan, fema, vincent gentile, obamacare, ny-11, staten island, annadale, michael grimm", "generator": "WordPress.com", "msapplication-TileColor": "#2b5797", "sailthru.title": "Republican Congressional Contender Defends Portions of Obamacare", "sailthru.byline_email": "rbarkan@observer.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "sailthru.byline_slug": "ross", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/20150318_101508.jpg?quality=80&w=50", "description": "Staten Island District Attorney Dan Donovan, a Republican candidate for Congress, defended Obamacare today.", "sailthru.byline_avatar_url": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/ross-barkan-headshot-e1402611381985.jpg?quality=80&w=132", "msapplication-tooltip": "News, Politics, Culture, Art, Style, Real Estate, Movie Reviews, TV recaps", "fb": {"app_id": 132947390197809}, "sailthru.byline_twitter": "@rossbarkan", "msapplication-TileImage": "//s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/newyorkobserver-2014/images/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "msvalidate.01": "F8C89E25D5233224541B1BB9B10BF573", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newyorkobserver", "published_time": "2015-03-18T15:51:36+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-18T17:28:08+00:00", "author": "http://observer.com/author/ross"}, "sailthru.description": "Staten Island District Attorney Dan Donovan, a Republican candidate for Congress, defended Obamacare today.", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "og": {"site_name": "Observer", "description": "Staten Island District Attorney Dan Donovan, a Republican candidate for Congress, defended Obamacare today.", "title": "Republican Congressional Contender Defends Portions of Obamacare", "url": "http://observer.com/2015/03/republican-congressional-contender-defends-obamacare/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/20150318_101508.jpg?quality=80&w=1200", "height": 675}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "146b7f62998343012fae89709f3a8167"}, "sailthru.byline_bio": "Ross Barkan is a national political reporter for The New York Observer.
