And they were \u2014 from the hand cut stone and sculptures to the lavish trees and fancy menu.\n\nDespite the extravagant decorations, the basic business model just didn\u2019t work. The Dallas campus has closed, and the others have either filed for bankruptcy or defaulted on loans.\n\nThe KERA radio story.\n\nThe idea for Forest Park Medical Center, reporter Matt Goodman says, was to appeal to doctors who wanted more control at the hospitals they worked at. Doctors who were tired of being treated as employees.\n\n\u201cSo these guys said hey, we can get the guys to invest in it, we can get the money, and as long as it\u2019s operating they can get returns and they\u2019ll also have this beautiful, big hospital to practice in,\u201d says Goodman, who\u2019s been covering the rise and fall of Forest Park Medical Center for D Magazine\u2019s D Healthcare Daily.\n\nThe doctor-owned hospital idea wasn\u2019t new in 2009. What was new? The fierce rate of expansion. Forest Park Medical Center opened five hospitals in Texas in just six years. Goodman says the business model was complicated.\n\n\u201cThe way they kind of differed,\u201d Goodman says, \u201cwas they started these companies around it that would handle the real estate, that would manage the facilities, a capital investment firm that would try and generate money to pay for this stuff and keep it going [\u2026] and they were ultra-luxury.\u201d\n\nTo put it simply, Forest Park Medical Center in Dallas was like a gold-plated house of Popsicle sticks.\n\nFirst, critics tried to blow the structure down\u2026\n\n\u201cA lot of the competition hated Forest Park, they were viewed as excessive, and people questioned their motives.\u201d\n\nKERA reached out to Forest Park Medical Center but didn\u2019t get a response. Ultimately, naysayers didn\u2019t sabotage the Dallas hospital. Goodman says the main reasons that campus closed in November were the Affordable Care Act and mismanagement.\n\nSee, the hospitals relied on money from out-of-network payments. As insurers tried to keep premiums down by limiting those out-of-network visits, less money was coming in. On top of that, the ACA has a penalty for physician-owned hospitals, and requires for-profits like Forest Park to pay taxes. Not-for-profit systems like Baylor and Parkland don\u2019t have to.\n\n[Check out \u201cBillions In Play In North Texas Hospital Building Boom\u201c]\n\n\u201cSo it was a lot of things coming together at once,\u201d Goodman says. \u201cAlso, the people involved were physicians and it didn\u2019t seem like they had that business person to guide them.\u201d\n\nToday, the Dallas hospital is closed, and some employees say they haven\u2019t received pay in months. The Frisco, Fort Worth and Southlake hospitals have either filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy or defaulted on loans. Forest Park\u2019s San Antonio hospital is closed and employees there have filed a class action lawsuit.\n\nFor patients, though, this is not a huge deal.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no shortage of options,\u201d Allan Baumgarten, a financial health policy analyst in Minnesota says. \u201cAnd presumably most of the doctors that were at Forest Park, also have admitting privileges at other local Dallas area hospitals.\u201d\n\nBaumgarten says while shutting down a hospital and filing for bankruptcy is a big deal, it\u2019s very likely that some of Forest Park\u2019s hospitals could be bought by another larger hospital system with a different management approach.\n\nHe says what happened with Forest Park reminds him of what happened when Krispy Kreme opened up a handful of shops in the Twin Cities a few years back.\n\n\u201cThere was a huge amount of buzz, there were reports about cars lining up blocks long to get Krispy Kreme donuts and after a few months the excitement died out, within about two years, all four stores had closed.\u201d\n\nThe Forest Park hospitals were also bright and shiny \u2013 they even smelled good. But, like Krispy Kreme donuts, they had a hole in the middle that left them vulnerable to collapse.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "affordable care act,bankruptcy,dallas-fort worth hospitals,elective surgery,for-profit hospital,forest park medical center,hospitals,insurance,out-of-network", "og": {"image": "http://breakthroughs.kera.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/11162202_813338468734255_5895947687289612345_n.jpg", "type": "website"}, "description": "The Forest Park Medical Center campuses were supposed to be more like spas than hospitals.\u00a0 And they were -- \u00a0from the hand cut stone and sculptures to the", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Forest Park Medical Center opened five hospitals in Texas in just six years.\nThe Forest Park Medical Center campuses were supposed to be more like spas than hospitals.\n[Check out \u201cBillions In Play In North Texas Hospital Building Boom\u201c]\u201cSo it was a lot of things coming together at once,\u201d Goodman says.\nThe idea for Forest Park Medical Center, reporter Matt Goodman says, was to appeal to doctors who wanted more control at the hospitals they worked at.\nOn top of that, the ACA has a penalty for physician-owned hospitals, and requires for-profits like Forest Park to pay taxes."}
