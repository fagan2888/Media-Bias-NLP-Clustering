Just in the days between May 1 and May 7, for example, the Seventh-Day Adventist evolution-denier Ben Carson announced his intention to seek the 2016 Republican nomination, as did the Southern Baptist and onetime pastor Mike Huckabee. The Episcopalian-turned-Roman Catholic Jeb Bush has puzzlingly refrained from following in their footsteps, but that he gave this year\u2019s commencement address at that stronghold of unreason and superstitious darkness, the Jerry Falwell-founded Liberty University, the site of the Southern Baptist Ted Cruz\u2019s announcement in late March, augurs ill for rationalists and other sane folk. Bush will announce, it\u2019s just a question of when.\n\nI note the religious affiliations of these potential contenders for the presidency because all are flaunting their faith, rather than keeping it a private matter of conscience, which in any other developed country it would be. The gist is, unless you profess a piety befitting the mullahs of the Islamic Republic of Iran, things are going to get much, much more unpleasant for you before one or another God-coddler enters the White House in January 2017 to replace President Obama.\n\nBut I won\u2019t deal with the faith-imbued cretinism of the Republicans in this essay. What concerns me now is what President Obama has just wrought to insult that most aggrieved (yet steadfastly growing) American minority, the advocates of reason, those who insist on evidence before accepting the truth of a given proposition, especially grand propositions about the origins of the universe and our species. On Wednesday, President Obama marked the deeply pathetic traditional outrage to rationalism that is the National Day of Prayer (since 1988 the first Thursday of May) with a proclamation bearing the stark, yet somehow comically august, title \u201cA PROCLAMATION.\u201d Ecumenically irrationalist, he urges us to pause and immerse ourselves in incantations addressed to a magical celestial despot, be He Judaic, Christian or, presumably, even Muslim, and thank Him for the fruits of our labor and for fortuitous events that have proved conducive to our contentment.\n\nActually, I\u2019ve just translated Obama\u2019s words into rationalese. In the original his verbiage sounds mostly like boilerplate pol-speak and preacher-talk, but it is troubling nonetheless, and merits attention, if not for the reasons he intended.\n\nAfter a bland preface, Obama reminds us that we Americans \u201ccherish\u201d religious liberty at home, and exhorts us to \u201crecommit to standing up for religious freedom around the world.\u201d\n\nI have no problem with these words per se. The Constitution guarantees freedom of religion, and the precepts of the Enlightenment endorse it as fostering comity among nations. Centuries of faith-fueled warfare and persecution in Europe convinced the Founding Fathers that a batty belief in an invisible \u201cdivine\u201d Tyrant (and attendant, equally batty, equally invisible \u201cSons\u201d and spirits and prophets and so forth) deserved no place in our government; it would be too divisive and subject to exploitation as a tool of repression. Hence the First Amendment.\n\nBut there is a contradiction inherent in Obama\u2019s act of \u201cproclaiming\u201d from the White House on National Day of Prayer; namely, that such a day should not exist, but since it does, the president should not avail himself of it to militate for the cause of faith. In 1952, in the depths of the Cold War confrontation with the atheist Soviet Union, Congress birthed the noisome basilisk of a law establishing the NDOP, which the Freedom From Religion Foundation valiantly (but unsuccessfully, of course) challenged in 2008 on (obvious) First Amendment grounds. Fresh challenges should be mounted until the NDOP goes the way of Jim Crow. To do my part in the fight for true secularism, I hereby contest the constitutionality of Obama\u2019s issuance of Lord-positive declarations from his podium as the chief officer of our officially godless republic, if only because such declarations menace the mental health and intellectual development of children. After all, in 1962 the Supreme Court decided against allowing prayer in public schools, so how is it that the president can use his office as a platform to call on us to beseech the \u201cAlmighty\u201d? Children might be exposed to such corrupting speech and suffer the same retardation religion has historically inflicted on science and education. If nothing else, the White House Web page displaying the Proclamation should carry the warning \u201cCONTAINS RELIGIOUS SPEECH \u2014 NOT SUITABLE FOR MINORS.\u201d\n\nThe Proclamation\u2019s subsequent palaver provides opportunities for parody, head-shaking and outright guffaws that no rationalist in need of levity can pass up. \u201cFor many of us,\u201d Obama declares, prayer is \u201can essential act of worship and a daily discipline that allows reflection, provides guidance, and offers solace.\u201d In what sense does murmuring petitions to a fictitious heavenly autocrat in the hope of procuring favorable outcomes constitute a \u201cdiscipline\u201d? Science is a discipline, the study of philosophy is a discipline, judo is a discipline, even meditation is a discipline. Appealing to an inexistent supernatural being is not a discipline, but, rather, an apotropaic ritual worthy of study by anthropologists and mental-health professionals. Moreover, any \u201cguidance\u201d received as the apparent result of such dark conjuring should cause grave alarm and prompt a visit to the local psychiatric ward. And any \u201csolace\u201d bestowed by such behavior is based on a false premise, and may provoke, ultimately, a crisis when and if the conjurors awaken from their self-induced trance, or just grow up.\n\nObama then informs us that prayer \u201cgives us the strength to do God\u2019s work: to feed the hungry, care for the poor, comfort the afflicted, and make peace where there is strife.\u201d Tell that to secular aid organizations such as Oxfam, USAID and the United Way (for more, see here), where, incidentally, no one spends donor money on proselytizing pamphlets or other venues for indoctrinating vulnerable people in occult dogmas. No need to drag mysticism into humanitarian work. Moreover, it is indisputable that religion (and especially Catholicism and Islam) does much to ensure the persistence of poverty and hunger across the globe. The Catholic Church, in forbidding condom use in AIDS-ravaged Africa, among other places, has helped bring about 11 million orphans. The Islamist aversion to educating women deprives entire populations of the intellectual potential of half their inhabitants, which hinders their societies\u2019 rise out of poverty through the one proven effective way \u2014 the empowerment of women, as the theoretical physicist Lawrence Krauss has observed.\n\nAs for religion\u2019s \u201cmaking peace where there is strife,\u201d Obama has it exactly backward. Mass conversion to atheism would serve us all better than atavistic attachment to polarizing dogmas and macabre fables inscribed in ancient books. Look at those stoking the world\u2019s most lethal conflicts today \u2014 ISIS, Boko Haram, al-Qaida and its many affiliates. They slaughter on a sectarian basis. One magic book isn\u2019t better than another. All are injurious to the commonweal. To solve our problems, we need to reason out solutions and work together, not obey dictates found in antiquated texts.\n\nObama then announces, and certainly without license from his rationalist constituency, that \u201cIn times of uncertainty or tragedy, Americans offer humble supplications for comfort for those who mourn, for healing for those who are sick, and for protection for those who are in harm\u2019s way. When we pray, we are reminded that we are not alone \u2014 our hope is a common hope, our pain is shared, and we are all children of God.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "We expect dimwits like Huckabee to buy into the fire and brimstone.
