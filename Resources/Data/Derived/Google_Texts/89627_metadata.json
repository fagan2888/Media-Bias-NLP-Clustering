No other CD 2 candidate has yet advertised on television in what is shaping up to be an intense GOP primary.\n\nDonning surgical scrubs, Dunn calls the Affordable Care Act \u201ca total disaster,\u201d saying it kills jobs and takes discretion away from doctors and patients.\n\n\u201cIf you want to end Obamacare, send a doctor to do the job, not another politician,\u201d says Dunn in the ad. \u201cBecause, health care works best when patients and doctors decide.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor the past 25 years, I have practiced medicine in North Florida,\u201d said Dunn. \u201cI know what works in our health care system and what doesn\u2019t.\n\nThe new 30-second spot will air in the sprawling CD 2, a recently redrawn seat that spans from Bay County in the west all the way to the Big Bend area, south and east of Tallahassee.\n\nAn earlier ad released in April focused on the Dunn\u2019s military service in the U.S. Army and wholesome personal profile.\n\nDunn is running against former U.S. Attorney Ken Sukhia, former Scott administration attorney Mary Thomas and Tallahassee businessman Jeff Moran for the GOP nomination in CD 2.\n\nSince seeing radical changes which forced incumbent Democratic U.S. Rep. Gwen Graham out of the previously competitive seat, the next CD 2 representative will all but certainly come out of the Aug. 30 primary.\n\nSee the full ad below:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Florida Politics", "description": "Republican candidate\u00a0Neal Dunn\u00a0will again\u00a0take to the airwaves for another round of early communication with voters in the 2nd Congressional District.
