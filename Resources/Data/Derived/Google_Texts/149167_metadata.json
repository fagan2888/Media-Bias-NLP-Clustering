Why are you running for the U.S. House of Representatives?\n\nI am running to bring change and fresh ideas to Congress and Hawaii. When my dad arrived in Hawaii in the 1960s as a immigrant from China, he started out as a beach boy at Waikiki. He was able to buy a home, put my brother and me through school, and give us opportunities we could never have had anywhere else in the world. It was no coincidence that was the era that Hawaii led the nation \u2014 and the world \u2014 in legalizing a woman\u2019s right to choose, ratifying the Equal Rights Amendment, granting near universal health care, and recognizing marriage equality. Today, that American dream is slipping away. I want to restore that same energy\u2026", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Civil Beat News", "description": "Editor\u2019s note:\u00a0For Hawaii\u2019s Aug. 9 primary, Civil Beat asked candidates to answer some questions.
