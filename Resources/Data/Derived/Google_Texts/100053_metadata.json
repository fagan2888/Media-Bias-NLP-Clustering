Three of them were to Johnson, who also tied a personal best, in a 45-14 rout of Philadelphia on Thursday.\n\nThe Lions (4-7) have won three straight this season and three in a row in their annual Thanksgiving game.\n\nThe Eagles (4-7) are on a three-game losing streak. They have allowed at least 45 points in two straight games in one season for the first time in team history, according to STATS.\n\nStafford threw for more than 200 yards and three touchdowns without a turnover by halftime, helping the Lions lead 24-7. He finished 27 of 38 for 337 yards and threw five TDs for the fourth time in his career. Johnson had eight catches for 93 yards and three TDs, matching his career high set in 2010.\n\nAfter not throwing to Johnson much early in the game, Stafford started connecting with the star receiver. The Eagles couldn\u2019t do much about it, especially when starting cornerback Nolan Carroll left the game with a broken right ankle and was replaced by rookie Eric Rowe.\n\nStafford threw a 25-yard pass high in the end zone, where only the 6-foot-5 Johnson could catch it, to put Detroit ahead 24-7 with 12 seconds left in the first half. The quarterback seems to be clicking with the plays called by offensive coordinator Jim Bob Cooter, who replaced the fired Joe Lombardi a month ago.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Stafford throws 5 TDs to lift Lions to 45-14 win over Eagles", "title": "Stafford throws 5 TDs to lift Lions to 45-14 win over Eagles", "og": {"url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/11/26/stafford_throws_5_tds_to_lift_lions_to_45_14_win_over_eagles/", "site_name": "Salon", "type": "article", "description": "Stafford throws 5 TDs to lift Lions to 45-14 win over Eagles", "title": "Stafford throws 5 TDs to lift Lions to 45-14 win over Eagles"}, "twitter": {"description": "Stafford throws 5 TDs to lift Lions to 45-14 win over Eagles", "title": "Stafford throws 5 TDs to lift Lions to 45-14 win over Eagles", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@salon"}, "author": "Larry Lage", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Stafford tied a career high with five touchdown passes.\nJohnson had eight catches for 93 yards and three TDs, matching his career high set in 2010.\nStafford threw for more than 200 yards and three touchdowns without a turnover by halftime, helping the Lions lead 24-7.\nHe finished 27 of 38 for 337 yards and threw five TDs for the fourth time in his career.\nThree of them were to Johnson, who also tied a personal best, in a 45-14 rout of Philadelphia on Thursday."}
