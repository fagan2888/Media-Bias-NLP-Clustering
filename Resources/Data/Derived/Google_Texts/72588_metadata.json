Terry McAuliffe speaks to the media after a bill signing in Richmond on June 13. McAuliffe vetoed portions of the state budget on Friday. (Steve Helber/AP)\n\nVirginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe vetoed portions of the state budget Friday and vowed to defy the legislature by expanding Medicaid without its approval, setting up a legal showdown with Republicans even as he averted a government shutdown.\n\nMcAuliffe\u2019s actions \u2014 cheered as bold leadership from the left, denounced as brazen overreach on the right \u2014 represent a bid to reassert his power as chief executive following the GOP\u2019s recent takeover of the state Senate. They plunged a Capitol that puts a premium on gentility more deeply than ever into harsh, Washington-style enmity.\n\nMcAuliffe unveiled his plans while accusing Republicans of \u201cdemagoguery, lies, fear and cowardice.\u201d The Democrat blasted them for the first seven minutes of his 20-minute news conference before getting to his main point: He would prevent a government shutdown by signing the budget, but he would also exercise his line-item veto seven times, in part to strike budget language that Republicans intended to block Medicaid expansion.\n\nLegislators will act on McAuliffe\u2019s vetoes Monday when they reconvene in Richmond, and the outcome is uncertain. The GOP\u2019s majority is large enough in the House of Delegates to override a veto, but not in the Senate.\n\nYet House Republicans are considering parliamentary moves that could kill the vetoes before they ever get to the other chamber.\n\nHealth-care impasse\n\nNo matter what happens in the General Assembly, McAuliffe will be searching for a way to extend health coverage to 400,000 low-income Virginians through the Affordable Care Act.\n\nSo far, he has offered no specifics about how he would do that in a state where all funding \u2014 even the pass-through money from Washington available to bankroll Medicaid expansion \u2014 must be appropriated by the legislature. Republicans say expanding Medicaid without legislative authority would be illegal.\n\nMcAuliffe said the \u201cmoral imperative\u201d to provide health insurance to the poor was forcing him to bypass the Republican-controlled General Assembly. For months, the governor has been quietly exploring ways to get around the legislature to expand Medicaid.\n\nFor the first time Friday, he publicly acknowledged he was going that route \u2014 even as some of his own allies questioned the constitutionality of his decision.\n\n\u201cSecretary Hazel will have a plan on my desk by no later than September 1st detailing how we can move Virginia health care forward even in the face of the demagoguery, lies, fear and cowardice that have gripped this debate for too long,\u201d McAuliffe said, referring to William A. Hazel Jr., the secretary of health and human resources.\n\nRepublicans reacted furiously, suggesting that they would use parliamentary moves and even legal action to block some of McAuliffe\u2019s vetoes and any attempt at unilateral action on Medicaid.\n\n\u201cThe Governor\u2019s attempt to usurp the constitutionally proscribed powers of the legislative branch is a dangerous threat to the rule of law, separation of powers, and foundation of representative democracy that we simply cannot allow,\u201d House Speaker William J. Howell (R-Stafford) and other House GOP leaders said in a joint statement. \u201cWe are prepared to challenge this blatant executive overreach through all available avenues, including the court system.\u201d\n\nNowhere was the partisan divide more vividly on display than on Twitter, where Del. Mark L. Keam (D-Fairfax) celebrated the governor\u2019s vetoes by dubbing him \u201cT-Mack the Knife!\u201d and Del. Patrick A. Hope (D-Arlington) declared: \u201cThis is what leadership looks like!\u201d\n\nSen. Mark D. Obenshain (R-Harrisonburg), meanwhile, condemned McAuliffe\u2019s \u201coutrageous display of executive arrogance,\u201d and Del. Greg D. Habeeb (R-Salem) said the governor \u201chas made it clear he believes he was elected Emperor.\u201d\n\nMcAuliffe\u2019s heated rhetoric and go-it-alone strategy marked a dramatic \u2014 and likely irreversible \u2014 shift in tactics for a governor who had entered his first elective office with an aggressive bipartisan charm offensive, said former Virginia Commonwealth University professor Bob Holsworth.\n\n\u201cHe becomes a different governor today,\u201d Holsworth said. \u201cThe era of good feelings has absolutely evaporated.\u201d\n\nParliamentary options\n\nHouse Republicans suggested that at least one of the seven vetoes could be ruled out of order when lawmakers return to Richmond on Monday, which would mean it would be tossed out before it ever gets to the Senate.\n\nA variety of parliamentary moves could put that question into play, with either Speaker Howell or House Clerk G. Paul Nardo empowered to rule on it.\n\nThe veto most in question strikes language that Republicans had added as an amendment to the budget when they passed it June 12. It specified that Medicaid cannot be expanded unless the General Assembly explicitly appropriates money for it.\n\nRepublicans note that the state Supreme Court has ruled that a governor can veto entire budget items but not portions of those items. Since the language is part of a broader Medicaid budget item, Republicans say it is possible that McAuliffe cannot veto that portion without vetoing the state\u2019s entire Medicaid program.\n\nAnother of McAuliffe\u2019s vetoes would eliminate all language related to a state Medicaid commission.\n\nThe panel had been set up under then-Gov. Robert F. McDonnell (R) to determine whether the existing Medicaid program had achieved certain reforms that the legislature required before expansion could take place. Democrats had pushed for its creation, but Republicans had used it to thwart expansion.\n\nMcAuliffe called the commission a \u201csham to pretend that the legislature is serious about Medicaid reform and expansion.\u201d His veto was seen as largely symbolic, because language creating the commission will remain in the state code even if it is removed from the budget.\n\nAnother veto would strip $300,000 in funding for an ethics commission created in response to a $165,000 gifts scandal involving McDonnell and his wife, Maureen.\n\nMcAuliffe signed the bill creating the commission and made no substantive changes to ethics legislation the legislature passed this year.\n\nBut on Friday, he said the reforms were \u201cfar weaker than what Virginians deserve.\u201d He said funding the commission would be premature until tougher ethics rules are passed.\n\nIn another apparent slap at legislators, McAuliffe issued a directive that state staff suspend all planning work for a new Capitol Square office building meant to house lawmakers and their staffs. McAuliffe had already signed off on the $300 million building. On Friday, he said it was inappropriate at a time when budget writers \u201ccan\u2019t find $10 million to decrease homelessness.\u201d\n\nThe governor has seven days to take action on the budget, which reached his desk Sunday. His office indicated that he is likely to offer more changes before the clock expires this weekend.\n\nOn the campaign trail and in office, McAuliffe promised that he would not sign a budget that did not expand Medicaid. As a result, passage of the state budget has been deadlocked for months, with McAuliffe and a slim majority of the Senate in favor and the House opposed.\n\nThe impasse threatened to cause a government shutdown if it was not resolved by the start of the fiscal year July 1.\n\nLiberal groups had implored McAuliffe on Thursday to veto the entire budget, but he said he did not dare do so with just 10 days to go.\n\nMcAuliffe quickly used his actions on the budget to try to raise cash for his political action committee.\n\nIn a fundraising e-mail Friday, the governor slammed the GOP and, before asking for a $5 donation, said: \u201cI remain committed to the central promise of my campaign: One of the wealthiest states in one of the wealthiest nations in the world has no excuse for not providing health care to its needy citizens.\u201d\n\nSome supporters of Medicaid expansion questioned McAuliffe\u2019s strategy. His sole GOP ally in the House, Del. Thomas Davis Rust (R-Fairfax), said the governor is missing an opportunity to debate detailed expansion plans and seek broader support in the House.\n\n\u201cMy advice would have been sign the budget and call a special session,\u201d Rust said. \u201cThat\u2019s the legislative process. This is sort of tossing that out the window, unfortunately.\u201d\n\nmichael.laris@washpost.com\n\nrachel.weiner@washpost.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Closely divided Virginia Senate is unlikely to muster the votes to override McAuliffe\u2019s actions.", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/rachel.elise.weiner", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Closely divided Virginia Senate is unlikely to muster the votes to override McAuliffe\u2019s actions.", "title": "Governor Terry McAuliffe vetoes portions of state budget, vows to expand Medicaid without GOP approval", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/gov-terry-mcauliffe-vetoes-portions-of-virginia-budget-prolonging-medicaid-standoff/2014/06/20/960d98a8-f879-11e3-a3a5-42be35962a52_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/06/19/Local-Politics/Images/Medicaid_Expansion_VA-0d969-542.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@rachelweinerwp"}, "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "va politics, virginia politics, mcauliffe budget, mcauliffe medicaid expansion.", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/rachel.elise.weiner"}, "eomportal-uuid": "960d98a8-f879-11e3-a3a5-42be35962a52", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "va politics, virginia politics, mcauliffe budget, mcauliffe medicaid expansion."}, "article_summary": "Yet House Republicans are considering parliamentary moves that could kill the vetoes before they ever get to the other chamber.\nMcAuliffe vetoed portions of the state budget on Friday.\nSince the language is part of a broader Medicaid budget item, Republicans say it is possible that McAuliffe cannot veto that portion without vetoing the state\u2019s entire Medicaid program.\nAnother of McAuliffe\u2019s vetoes would eliminate all language related to a state Medicaid commission.\nOn the campaign trail and in office, McAuliffe promised that he would not sign a budget that did not expand Medicaid."}
