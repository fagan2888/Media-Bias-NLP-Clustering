Observers wrote field notes describing all aspects of cell phone use and child and parent behavior during the meal.\n\nused their cell phones almost continuously throughout the meal, eating and talking while looking at their device or only putting it down briefly to eat or speak with their children. This pattern of use occurred across age groups, genders, and group sizes .\n\nParents who used non-calling functions such as texting, Parents who used non-calling functions such as texting, social networking , or playing a game, showed the highest degree of absorption , because they were looking primarily at the device. Phone calls could be absorbing, according to the study authors, but parents \"usually maintained some eye contact with children during these calls, which did not last through entire meals as texting or swiping could.\"\n\n\n\nAccording to Gene Beresin, MD, Executive Director of the Massachussetts General Hospital Clay Center for Young Healthy Minds, mealtimes are \"generally times when children make attachments. It\u2019s not a time when one is typically working. When we eat, when we snuggle, when a parent puts a child to bed \u2014 these are important times when parent-child connectedness is important. It sends a message to the child to pay attention to each other, to establish some intimacy. The moral of the story is be observant. Be mindful. Be aware. Both in what you are doing and in what you are teaching your children.\"\n\n\n\nThe study also looked at how children responded when their caregivers began to use their phones, and found that many began to test their parents' limits in order gain attention . Parents often continued looking at their cell phones while answering questions or giving instructions to their children, delayed their responses , did not respond at all, or ignored their child\u2019s behavior for a while, then reacted with a \"scolding tone of voice, gave repeated instructions in a somewhat robotic manner , seemed insensitive to the child\u2019s expressed needs, or used\n\nphysical responses\" such as kicking the child's feet under the table or pushing the child's hands away when trying to lift her mom's face up from looking at her screen.\n\nForty of the parents were on their phones at some point while dining with their children.
