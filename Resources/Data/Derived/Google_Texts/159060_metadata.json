Michelle Obama added a story that \u201csomebody asked him to get coffee\u201d when he wore a tuxedo at a formal dinner.\n\nMichelle Obama herself discussed being asked to reach something from a high shelf for someone while she was shopping at a suburban Washington, D.C. Target store, saying: \u201cThe only person who came up to me in the store was a woman who asked me to help her take something off a shelf. Because she didn\u2019t see me as the first lady, she saw me as someone who could help her. Those kinds of things happen in life. So it isn\u2019t anything new.\u201d\n\nMembers of the National Center\u2019s Project 21 black leadership network don\u2019t think the interview did anything to help with America\u2019s currently strained racial relations. In fact, it might have actually hurt them.\n\nBy telling the average black American that the President of the United States and his wife cannot get a break \u2014 even while they\u2019ve been in the White House \u2014 it is undoubtedly demoralizing.\n\nFor example, Project 21 co-chairman Horace Cooper said:\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s remarks are remarkably destructive. He stokes racial resentment and creates the false impression that racism and bigotry play a real role in whether blacks can currently achieve their aspirations. I have some questions for the President. Do any of these experiences mean that it isn\u2019t possible for black Americans to achieve in this country? Do they mean that a black man can\u2019t become the leader of the most powerful nation on the planet? I don\u2019t question the veracity of the President when he makes these claims, but I do question the validity of presenting them as legitimate examples of the barriers that hold black Americans back. Racism and bigotry are not the drivers of high unemployment, broken families and elevated crime in the black community. Obama\u2019s comments undermine the will to achieve and, by doing so, he is rhetorically cutting off the bottom rung of the achievement ladder \u2014 the very one that he used to advance. Using the highest office in the land to express personal resentments is divisive and will likely serve only to condemn legions of struggling blacks to poverty and no hope for experiencing the American Dream.\n\nAlso commenting on the People article and the potential fallout, Project 21 member Christopher Arps, appearing as a guest on the 12/17/14 edition of \u201cThe Rick Amato Show\u201d on the One America News Network, added:\n\nRight now, America is a racial tinderbox. And, for the President and First Lady to make these types of comments, in my opinion, is just reckless.\n\nChristopher thinks he might know why the Obamas said what they did. Noting that Obama\u2019s approval rating among all Americans is quite low, he pointed out that black Americans \u201care really carrying [Obama] right now\u201d when it comes to political support. But black support for the President is eroding, with some blacks referring to the controversy in Ferguson, Missouri as \u201cObama\u2019s Katrina\u201d \u2014 an allusion to the 2005 hurricane that hurt the reputation of former president George W. Bush.\n\nChristopher thinks Obama is seeking to bolster his credentials with his black base at the peril of the nation as a whole. He said:\n\nI think that these comments he\u2019s making are trying to authenticate himself [with other blacks]. I also think that this comes\u2026 when a lot of African-Americans are upset with him\u2026 Unfortunately, he\u2019s further dividing the country instead of bringing it together\u2026 To be intellectually honest, you have to bring up that he was elected a senator from Illinois, and he\u2019d been elected president and re-elected president. So you\u2019ve got to qualify that with those things that happened also.\n\nAdditionally, Michelle Obama\u2019s Target story, as told to People, conflicts with her description of it in a 2012 interview with late-night television talk show host David Letterman. On Letterman, she said she was \u201cundercover\u201d while she told People it was \u201cwonderfully publicized\u201d (though press coverage was extensive, it was not until was after the trip). She told Letterman, \u201cI felt so good\u201d helping the shorter woman get detergent from a high shelf, as opposed the People description of \u201cshe didn\u2019t see me as the first lady, she saw me as someone who could help her.\u201d\n\nChristopher said her new telling of the story was likely all part of a calculated strategy by the Obamas:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://www.conservativeblog.org/storage/P21HoraceCooper.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1418936132910", "description": "In a new interview with People magazine, Barack and Michelle Obama claim that, in the words of int...", "title": "Obamas' Comments on Race in People Magazine \"Just Reckless\"\u00a0 - Amy Ridenour's National Center Blog - A Conservative Blog"}, "blogburst-verify": "B9EORVLmLdD0z2JKwETUEmoZ", "Robots": "index,follow"}, "article_summary": "Do any of these experiences mean that it isn\u2019t possible for black Americans to achieve in this country?\nAnd, for the President and First Lady to make these types of comments, in my opinion, is just reckless.\nNoting that Obama\u2019s approval rating among all Americans is quite low, he pointed out that black Americans \u201care really carrying [Obama] right now\u201d when it comes to political support.\nHe said:I think that these comments he\u2019s making are trying to authenticate himself [with other blacks].\nAdditionally, Michelle Obama\u2019s Target story, as told to People, conflicts with her description of it in a 2012 interview with late-night television talk show host David Letterman."}
