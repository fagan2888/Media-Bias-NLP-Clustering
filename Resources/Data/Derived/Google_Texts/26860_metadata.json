Steele said the institute opened on June 1 only after seven months of applications and inspections by the commission and the Department of Health, Nursing Division.\n\nIn Tupelo, Donna Steele is the director of the institute, where students take a six-week course that includes 96 hours of classroom instruction, lab training and clinical hands-on experience. The supervised clinical practice is done at Courtyards and Tupelo Nursing and Rehab. The Greenhouses and Sanctuary Hospice House are joining the rotation as well, she said.\n\n\u201cWe graduated our first class in July, with nine students,\u201d Steele said. \u201cWe have 30 students graduating in September.\u201d\n\nStudents spend five weeks in the classroom and one week in clinicals. Weekday classes are offered in four-hour blocks either in the morning or afternoon for six weeks, while Saturday-only classes are 8-hour sessions lasting for 12 weeks.\n\nSteele said there are \u201cmany opportunities for CNAs \u2013 they work in hospitals, nursing homes, in-home care, hospice care \u2026 they\u2019re the personal care team for a patient, as compared to a nurse, who takes care of the physical needs of the patients. CNAs make sure they\u2019re groomed, fed, bathed, getting turned in the bed and into a wheelchair, just getting out.\u201d\n\nThe BLS says nursing assistants and orderlies \u201cwork in nursing and residential care facilities and in hospitals. They are frequently active and may need to help lift or move patients.\u201d\n\nThe demand for CNAs and orderlies, BLS says, will increase in long-term care facilities because of the growing elderly population.\n\nSteele said one of the reasons Medical 2 wanted to open in Tupelo was because it saw an opportunity to meet a growing demand for CNAs in the area.\n\n\u201cWe have nursing homes and in-home companies calling us almost every day asking if we have people we can send them,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThere really hasn\u2019t been anything available as far training other than the two community colleges,\u201d Steele said. \u201cOur students have to get certification as well, and they have to take the state board, they have to know their 22 skills and they have to take a written test, too. \u2026 The only difference is we\u2019re learning at a much faster pace.\u201d\n\nStudents are instructed in such skills as basic nursing, measuring vital signs, documentation, bathing, hygiene, dressing skills, movement of patients, infection control, making beds, nutrition and eating assistance.\n\n\u201cWe have students from all over North Mississippi,\u201d Steele said. \u201cThe students can complete the course in six weeks, sit for the state board and have a new career in less than three months.\n\n\u201cWe have students hired at NMMC, The Greenhouses, Total Health Care, Right at Home and Courtyards. Certified Nurse Assistants can work at hospitals, nursing homes, home care, hospice, rehab homes, and home health agencies.\u201d\n\nGail Lee was among the first graduates of the institute in July, and she works at Total Health Care.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great program,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThey teach you everything you need to know before you leave and they make sure you\u2019ve learned it before you go get certified.\n\nLee said she loves her job at Total Health Care, and was glad that Medical 2 was an available option.\n\n\u201cI was actually licensed as a CNA nine years ago, but I had let it lapse,\u201d she said. \u201cSome of the things were the same, but a lot has changed over the years. I\u2019m glad I could get certified again in just six weeks.\u201d\n\nAs for pay, Steele said CNAs are paid $9 to $11 per hour, depending on the setting and any shift differential.\n\nThe BLS, in its most recent report last year, said the median annual wage for nursing assistants was $24,420 in May 2012.\n\n\u201cA lot of CNAs see it as a stepping stone to a nursing career, and it\u2019s not uncommon to be a CNA part-time while going to nursing school,\u201d Steele said.\n\nShe also said the institute plans to offer additional training classes in the future.\n\nFor more information, call the Medical 2 Training Institute at (877) 741-1996 or (662) 844-9400.
