One of only three black academic instructors I ever encountered prior to college, Beatrice Gaulden was a passionate, flamboyant and challenging fourth grade teacher, who faithfully drank eight tall glasses of water a day, and once showed up to our class in neon green Hammer pants. It infuriated me that she often wrote in a conduct grade on our report cards, because though I was an A student academically, my penchant for keeping up constant chatter with anyone who sat near me always netted me a B- or lower for conduct.\n\nDespite her hipness, Mrs. Gaulden was fundamentally old school. She kinda reminds me of that line from the Common Sense joint: She was old school, when I was just a shorty, never knew throughout my life, she would be there for me.\n\nI know it\u2019s a tribute to first loves, but Bea Gaulden made me fall in love with learning. She was the first teacher who I felt was for me, and the lessons she taught have been there as a constant reminder of who I am and can be. She wasn\u2019t my first good teacher. Even my \u201cbad\u201d teachers \u2013 ones not particularly welcoming of black students\u2013 were great instructors. But she recognized what it meant to be a stalwart advocate for a precocious black girl in a sea of white children.\n\nShe first recognized that I was a natural skeptic, prone to question all the information that she shared from her perch on a grey metal stool in the front of the room. Rather than seeing those questions as a challenge to her authority, she pulled me to the side one day and said, \u201cDo you question your white teachers like this?\u201d I thought about it and realized that even at 8 years, I mostly accepted what all my white teachers had to say without question. When I answered her honestly, \u201cNo,\u201d she said simply, \u201cNever stop questioning.\u201d To this day, I am relentless about asking questions, and as a student leaving her class, I never again accepted easy answers or attempts by instructors to dismiss or silence me.\n\nShe is the first teacher who nurtured my passions. So when I showed up one day reading a juvenile biography of Martin Luther King that my aunt had purchased for me, Mrs. Gaulden asked to see what I was reading. They had suggested in the back of the book that turning it into a play might be a good supplemental learning activity, and I asked if we could.\n\nShe enthusiastically said yes, and then shepherded my class through the process of putting on a play, which we performed for the third-, fourth\u2013 and fifth\u2013graders during Black History Month. I starred as Rosa Parks, in our reenactment of the Montgomery Bus Boycott.\n\nOn the day it came time to choose the classmate who would play Martin Luther King, Mrs. Gaulden asked for volunteers. Two students raised their hands, a white girl (let\u2019s call her Cindy) and a black boy named Bruce. Cindy raised her hand first, and in fairness, Mrs. Gaulden dutifully wrote her name on the board beside the role of MLK.", "article_metadata": {"description": "When my favorite teacher asked for volunteers to play Dr. King, what happened next sticks with me to this day", "title": "Blackface in my fourth grade play: How a white girl with a racist dad played MLK", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "When my favorite teacher asked for volunteers to play Dr. King, what happened next sticks with me to this day", "title": "Blackface in my fourth grade play: How a white girl with a racist dad played MLK", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/01/21/blackface_in_my_4th_grade_play_how_a_white_girl_with_a_racist_dad_played_mlk/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/martin_luther_king4.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "When my favorite teacher asked for volunteers to play Dr. King, what happened next sticks with me to this day", "title": "Blackface in my fourth grade play: How a white girl with a racist dad played MLK", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/martin_luther_king4.jpg", "creator": "@professorcrunk", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Brittney Cooper", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com,", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdb06\"", "article_summary": "Cindy raised her hand first, and in fairness, Mrs. Gaulden dutifully wrote her name on the board beside the role of MLK.\nOn the day it came time to choose the classmate who would play Martin Luther King, Mrs. Gaulden asked for volunteers.\nDespite her hipness, Mrs. Gaulden was fundamentally old school.\nTwo students raised their hands, a white girl (let\u2019s call her Cindy) and a black boy named Bruce.\nBut she recognized what it meant to be a stalwart advocate for a precocious black girl in a sea of white children."}
