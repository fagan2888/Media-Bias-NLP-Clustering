Bill O’Reilly opened his show Tuesday night claiming that Obamacare is just an element of the ideal society liberals have in mind for the U.S.: a socialist state where money is taken from the rich to provide the poor with multitudes of services they cannot afford on their own. O’Reilly cited various clips of Democratic congresspeople and one MSNBC host to argue that Obamacare is part of this “socialist-communist vision.”

He recapped all the “chaos” of Obamacare and the “perilous place” President Obama and the Democrats are in right now, saying the health care law is “part of a vision for the forced sharing of American assets.”

He argued that most of the nation’s debt came from “providing entitlements and infrastructure” and said it’s a slippery slope to take a subculture of uneducated, unskilled people and letting the state pay for all kinds of services that cover them. O’Reilly said, “Most Americans don’t understand what the deuce is going on in this country.”

He concluded, “The USA in this point in time can’t afford to pay for Obamacare, unless working Americans give up more of their assets.”
