Last night on the O'Reilly Factor, Bill O'Reilly said State Department Spokeswoman Jen Psaki is in over her head and Deputy Spokeswoman Marie Harf is really upset about it. Keep in mind Harf and Psaki both speak on behalf of Secretary of State John Kerry.

.@statedeptspox explains foreign policy w/ intelligence & class. Too bad we can't say the same about @oreillyfactor: http://t.co/n1I5B6kheF â€” Marie Harf (@marieharf) September 4, 2014

Just this week Psaki has refused to call Russia's invasion of Ukraine an "invasion," wouldn't say America is at war with ISIS, couldn't clarify what President Obama meant when he said he wanted to destroy ISIS while also "managing" them, wouldn't confirm if passports belonging to Americans knowingly fighting for ISIS have been revoked and said she wasn't going to "put labels" on the beheading of American journalist Steven Sotloff.

The Obama administration doesn't "have a strategy yet" about how to deal with ISIS but they sure have a strategy down about how to attack and whine about Fox News. Have no fear America, we're in good hands.
