Hoffman finished at 12-under 276 and earned $1,116,000 for his fourth PGA Tour victory.\n\nPlaying alongside Hoffman, Reed also birdied the par-5 18th for a 69. He missed birdie putts inside 8 feet on the par-3 16th and par-4 17th.\n\nReed, who was born in San Antonio, put the pressure on Hoffman with a tap-in birdie at the 18th after reaching the fringe on the 595-yard hole in two. His shot to the green came from the left-hand rough, and had to clear an oak tree and creek in front of the green.\n\nHoffman followed by hitting his third shot from a greenside bunker to set up his birdie.\n\nChad Collins was a career-best third at 10 under after a 69. He birdied four of the last five holes.\n\nThird-round leader Ricky Barnes, looking for his first PGA Tour win in 222 tries, stumbled to a 74 to drop into a tie for fourth at 9 under with Kevin Chappell (68), Billy Herschel (70), Ryan Palmer (69) and Martin Piller (70). It was a career best for Piller, the husband of LPGA Tour player Gerina Piller.\n\nBrendan Steele, the 2011 winner who led the first two rounds, had a 75 to tie for 13th at 7 under.\n\nReed pulled within a shot of Hoffman with a 23-foot birdie putt from the fringe at 15. Hoffman mised a 10-foot birdie try on the hole.\n\nReed missed a bending, right-to-left putt from 7 feet that could have tied Hoffman at 16, and missed a straighter putt from about the same distance on the next hole.\n\nPiller birdied the 12th with a 14-foot putt to take a two-shot advantage over Reed and Hoffman.\n\nBut he gave it back with a double bogey on the par-3 13th. His tee shot plugged into the sand in the steep-faced bunker fronting the green. He blasted out - past the green - then chipped back and two putted.\n\nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press.
