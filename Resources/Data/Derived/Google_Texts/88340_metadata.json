Mike Lee, R-Utah, remains a key player in reform efforts, actively promoting legislation that would scale back the nation\u2019s high incarceration rates and reduce a ballooned prison population primarily through easing mandatory minimum sentencing laws.\n\n\u201cWhen we get [mandatory minimums] wrong, it affects real people,\u201d Lee said Wednesday morning during an event hosted by The Washington Post, adding:\n\nThis robs real communities of husbands, fathers, sons, uncles, nephews, over and over and over again\u2014communities that could benefit, families that could benefit, from their return, from their rehabilitation.\n\nLee, a conservative, is working alongside two unlikely liberal allies to push the legislation to the floor: Sens. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., and Cory Booker, D-N.J.\n\nBut conservative opponents, spearheaded by Sens. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., and Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., say they fear that the changes to mandatory minimum sentencing laws would enable thousands of \u201cviolent felons\u201d to enjoy early release from prison.\n\nIn an op-ed published Tuesday, Cotton called the bipartisan legislation \u201ca massive social experiment in criminal leniency,\u201d warning his colleagues on both sides of the aisle that relaxed sentencing laws could prove \u201cdevastating\u201d to Americans.\n\nThough only a few conservatives are publicly challenging the bill, the momentum may be enough to derail substantial change in 2016.\n\nBut Lee said he doesn\u2019t believe that the bill is \u201cstalled,\u201d despite such speculation.\n\nThe Senate\u2019s comprehensive criminal justice legislation initially was written to give judges greater discretion to reduce prison time for certain drug offenders, including some violent felons or convicts found guilty of illegally possessing a firearm.\n\nThe \u201cSentencing Reform and Corrections Act of 2015\u201d sailed out of the Senate Judiciary Committee with broad support last fall. But it has yet to land on the Senate floor for debate because of divisions among Republican lawmakers.\n\nPolitico reported Monday that Republicans who helped craft the initial bill are bowing to pressure from conservative opponents, conceding to major modifications they hope ultimately will move the bill forward.\n\nOne revision would strike a proposal intended to slice mandatory prison time for \u201carmed career criminals,\u201d which federal law defines as those guilty of illegally carrying a firearm who also have three prior convictions for violent felonies or a record of serious drug offenses.\n\nThe bill\u2019s authors initially reduced the mandatory minimum sentence from 15 years to 10 years. However, Politico reported that a senior GOP aide said this section has been rolled back, leaving the initial punishment intact.\n\nAnother change would slash the opportunity for inmates who had been found guilty of possessing a firearm during a violent offense or drug crime to \u201cretroactively\u201d qualify for a reduced prison sentence, Politico reported.\n\nJohn Malcolm, director of The Heritage Foundation\u2019s Meese Center for Legal and Judicial Studies, said the senators who opposed the initial bill were \u201cunderstandably concerned\u201d that certain provisions would reduce mandatory minimums and lead to the early release of repeat violent felons and drug offenders who had possessed firearms.\n\n\u201cIt is one thing to reduce penalties for low-level drug dealers with minimal or no prior criminal records. It is quite another to give the same consideration to individuals who pose the greatest threat to public safety,\u201d Malcolm told The Daily Signal.\n\nThe legislation, introduced in October by Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, gained support from liberals such as Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., ranking member of the Judiciary Committee. The White House also endorsed it.\n\nOn Monday, The Washington Post\u2019s \u201cFact Checker\u201d column said Cotton\u2019s repeated charge that the bill would release \u201cthousands of violent felons\u201d onto U.S. streets creates a \u201cmisleading impression\u201d of a \u201ccomplex\u201d reform.\n\nBesides Booker, Durbin, Grassley, Leahy, and Lee, the bill\u2019s original sponsors include John Cornyn, R-Texas; Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.; Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.; Tim Scott, R-S.C.; and Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I.\n\nGrassley worked with Lee to ease concerns from GOP members during a briefing Tuesday evening with law enforcement officers.\n\nLee and Grassley argue that the legislation would enhance public safety through reduced recidivism rates while decreasing overcrowding in prisons.
