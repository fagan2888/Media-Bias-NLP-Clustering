Priscilla Dunn, D-Bessemer, said in a news release.\n\nThe agenda includes:\n\n-- A proposed constitutional amendment to allow a lottery and casinos, with proceeds going into the Education Trust Fund and General Fund. According to the caucus, it's important to include casinos with the lottery bill because they create jobs.\n\n-- A bill sponsored by Sen. Linda Coleman, D-Birmingham, to create a state minimum wage of $10.\n\n-- A bill by Sen. Bobby Singleton, D-Greensboro, to restrict companies that receive incentives or other funds from the Alabama Department of Commerce from using temporary workers for more than 5 percent of their workforce.\n\n-- A bill by Coleman to required combined income reporting from out-of-state companies doing business in Alabama, a measure that would close a corporate tax loophole, according to the caucus.\n\n-- A \"ban the box\" bill by Sen. Quinton Ross, D-Montgomery, to allow those with felonies to wait until a job is offered before disclosing their criminal background.\n\n-- A bill by Sen.
