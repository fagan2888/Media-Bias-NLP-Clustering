ST. LOUIS (KMOX) – The Parkway School District says Obamacare is forcing it to outsource the employment of its substitute teachers. It’s that or face a $4 million penalty for not offering heathcare to the part-time employees.

Nancy Buchannan, a substitute teacher in the district, says she doesn’t need insurance, and says subs already feel unappreciated by the district.

“We don’t meet when the bell rings. Often times, we’re doing lesson plans for teachers who are too sick,” Buchannan says.

But board members last night voted to contract out to Kelly Educational Services, which promises to maintain the quality of teachers it’ll send to fill-in.
