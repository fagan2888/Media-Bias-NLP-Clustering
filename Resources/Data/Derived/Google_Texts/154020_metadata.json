The scandal erupted against the backdrop of FIFA\u2019s 65th Congress on May 29, where its president Sepp Blatter was reelected. (Editor\u2019s note: Blatter announced on June 2 that he would resign.)\n\n\n\nAlready, credit card company Visa said it would reassess its sponsorship deals unless Fifa makes changes, while Coca-Cola, McDonald\u2019s, Hyundai Motor and Adidas expressed concerns, according to media reports. The FIFA scandal has also became the setting for international political duels. Russian President Vladimir Putin backed Blatter\u2019s re-election and accused the U.S. of meddling in areas outside its jurisdiction, while British prime minister David Cameron called for Blatter to step down.\n\nRelated: 4 Questions Raised by Sepp Blatter\u2019s Surprise Resignation\n\nIn the early hours of May 27, Swiss law enforcement officials arrested seven top FIFA officials from a five-star hotel in Zurich, as the U.S. Justice Department indicted 14 people for racketeering, money laundering and wire fraud. The department\u2019s Federal Bureau of Investigation did not name Blatter, but found FIFA officials and U.S. and South American sports business entities involved in bribes and kickbacks totaling $150 million over several years for arranging media and marketing deals for soccer tournaments.\n\nAlso charged was Jack Warner, who was formerly a FIFA vice president and secretary of the Trinidad & Tobago\u2019s Football Federation. He is accused of receiving $10 million in exchange for his vote on South Africa hosting the 2010 World Cup. He has turned himself in to Trinidad & Tobago police. U.S. authorities also searched the Miami headquarters of CONCACAF (the Confederation of North, Central America and Caribbean Association Football), one of the six regional confederations that make up FIFA.\n\nThe Lure of Big Money\n\n\u201cThis is the best thing that could have happened to the game,\u201d said Warren Barton, longtime player with the English Premier League and now an analyst for Fox Sports\u2019s soccer coverage. \u201cIt shook the world \u2014 not just soccer but the business world as well. People are realizing how powerful the game is and how much money is involved in the game, and in that respect we have to have the game transparent.\u201d A Justice Department press release points out that according to FIFA, 70% of its $5.7 billion in total revenues between 2011 and 2014 was attributable to the sale of TV and marketing rights to the 2014 World Cup.\n\n\u201cNow, we get to the deal making\u201d after the arrests and the indictments, said Andrew Brandt, NFL business analyst with ESPN, a Wharton lecturer in sports business and a faculty advisor at the Wharton Sports Business Initiative. \u201cPeople are going to talk, \u2026 make deals, \u2026 immunize themselves by turning over evidence, and that could go all the way to the top.\u201d\n\nOn May 28 (prior to Blatter\u2019s resignation), Barton and Brandt discussed the ramifications of the FIFA scandal on the future of the game on the Knowledge@Wharton show on Wharton Business Radio on SiriusXM channel 111. (Listen to the podcast at the top of this page.)\n\n\u201cThese individuals and organizations engaged in bribery to decide who would televise games, where the games would be held and who would run the organization overseeing organized soccer worldwide,\u201d said U.S. Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch at a press conference. \u201cThey did this over and over, year after year, tournament after tournament.\u201d FIFA officials used the U.S. banking system for their dealings, she noted. \u201cThey clearly thought the U.S. was a safe financial haven for them,\u201d she added. Lynch led the probe when she was earlier the U.S. Attorney General for the Eastern District of New York in Brooklyn.\n\nRelated: Why the U.S., of All Countries, Stepped Up to Save Soccer\n\nBarton agreed with Brandt that more details would emerge as the indicted people face the prospect of jail terms. He said suspicions of such dealings have been around for a long time \u201cbut we needed hard evidence\u201d that is now available. He felt the wrongdoings unearthed now are just \u201cthe tip of the iceberg.\n\nUnder Pressure\n\nIn any event, Barton said he wanted Blatter to take responsibility for the wrongdoings. \u201cIt is damaging the image of the game. The game is bigger than any one individual,\u201d he said. \u201cUltimately whether Sepp Blatter knew about it or not \u2014 which I think he did \u2014 it [occurred] on his watch, so he has to take full responsibility.\u201d\n\nBlatter said on May 28, according to a report in The Guardian, \u201cI know many people hold me ultimately responsible [but] I cannot monitor everyone all the time. If people want to do wrong, they will also try to hide it.\u201d\n\nBarton also called for a second look at the FIFA voting process that enabled Russia to host the World Cup in 2018 and Qatar to host it in 2022. If no wrongdoing is found, he said he had no issue with the two countries hosting the World Cup events. All the same, he said \u201cit didn\u2019t sound right\u201d that Qatar gets to host a summertime event like the soccer World Cup, where summer days often see temperatures of up to 125 degrees Fahrenheit. (The event has been moved to November, instead of June or July, due to the high temperatures.) Swiss authorities said they have launched a criminal investigation into how Russia and Qatar were selected.\n\n\u2018Mafia-Style\u2019 Tactics\n\nBarton and Brandt were also shocked by the methods used by the actors in the corruption scandal. The indictment details the scope of the conspiracy. It talks of the use of \u201cconsulting services\u201d agreements \u201cto create an appearance of legitimacy for illicit payments,\u201d bankers, financial advisors, and currency dealers for illicit payments; shell companies, numbered bank accounts in tax havens; concealment of foreign bank accounts; bulk cash smuggling; safe deposit boxes, and more.\n\nBrandt characterized those as \u201ctactics used by drug traffickers and organized crime syndicates.\u201d Added Barton: \u201cIt has what a movie would be made of.\u201d He noted that \u201carrogance\u201d drove actors in the conspiracy to have acted in such brazen ways. \u201cHubris and arrogance,\u201d agreed Brandt. \u201c\u201d\n\nBarton worried about the impact of the scandal on the future of the sport\u2019s popularity. \u201cThe game is being tarnished by this,\u201d he said. \u201cNow you have kids looking at the game in a different light.\u201d Brandt disagreed. \u201cThe sport\u2019s ascendancy continues \u2026 [and its] popularity seems as high as ever.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "There have been widespread", "title": "FIFA Scandal: 'The Best Thing That Could Have Happened to the Game'", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/06/03/FIFA-Scandal-Best-Thing-Could-Have-Happened-Game", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/soccer-fifa-blatter_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/06/03/FIFA-Scandal-Best-Thing-Could-Have-Happened-Game", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/soccer-fifa-blatter_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "There have been widespread", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd71d8\"", "article_summary": "The FIFA scandal has also became the setting for international political duels.\n\u201cThey did this over and over, year after year, tournament after tournament.\u201d FIFA officials used the U.S. banking system for their dealings, she noted.\n\u201cIt shook the world \u2014 not just soccer but the business world as well.\nThe scandal erupted against the backdrop of FIFA\u2019s 65th Congress on May 29, where its president Sepp Blatter was reelected.\nThe Lure of Big Money\u201cThis is the best thing that could have happened to the game,\u201d said Warren Barton, longtime player with the English Premier League and now an analyst for Fox Sports\u2019s soccer coverage."}
