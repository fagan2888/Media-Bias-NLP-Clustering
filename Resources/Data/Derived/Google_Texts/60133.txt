Health After Sting Videos Spur Protests, Arsonists Set Planned Parenthood Clinic Ablaze CREDIT: KREM.com via AP Pullman Planned Parenthood clinic, on fire

The heavily-edited videos targeting Planned Parenthood — and falsely suggesting that the organization is illegally selling fetal body parts — have prompted a nationwide campaign to force them out of business.

Many politicians are calling on Planned Parenthood to be defunded. On August 22, hundreds of people gathered in protest at the Pullman clinic in Washington State. At a nearby rally in Spokane, State Rep. Matt Shea “called [Planned Parenthood] ‘an evil organization’ committing acts on par with Nazi Germany.”

On Friday, the efforts took a darker turn.

Officials have concluded that the clinic in Pullman, Washington was set on fire by arsonists. Although no one was injured the fire will likely keep the clinic closed for at least a month.

In a statement, a Planned Parenthood official obliquely blamed the videos. “This is an appalling act of violence towards Planned Parenthood, but unfortunately a predictable ripple effect from the false and incendiary attacks that fuel violence from extremists,” Karl Eastlund, CEO of Planned Parenthood of Greater Washington and North Idaho, said.

The Pullman clinic does not offer abortion services but will refer women to places where they can get an abortion.

According to the National Abortion Federation, there have been over 200 arsons and bombings of clinics since the mid-1970s.
