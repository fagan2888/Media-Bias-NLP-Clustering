(AP) - Warren Long touched the ball three times for No. 23 Northwestern - and wound up making two critical plays.\n\nLong ran 55 yards for a touchdown, then recovered a fumbled punt return to help seal the Wildcats\u2019 19-10 victory over Duke on Saturday.\n\nSolomon Vault returned the opening kickoff of the second half 98 yards for the touchdown that put the Wildcats (3-0) ahead to stay.\n\nNorthwestern forced three turnovers and opened a season with three victories for the first time since 2013, when it reeled off four straight wins while earning its most recent Top 25 ranking.\n\nThat group then dropped seven in a row.\n\nCoach Pat Fitzgerald wants no part of a repeat.\n\n\u201cEverybody (in the locker room) really is not concerned with what other people think of us,\u201d Fitzgerald said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been a part of that roller-coaster ride for a couple years. We tore down that roller coaster. Burned it.\u201d\n\nThomas Sirk had a 5-yard touchdown run for Duke (2-1), which trailed 12-10 early in the fourth quarter but forced Northwestern into a third-and-1 at its own 45.\n\nLong took a handoff, burst untouched through the line and sprinted to the end zone to put the Wildcats up by nine with 12:31 remaining.\n\n\u201cEverybody fits gaps - two guys fit outside, instead of one inside, one outside,\u201d Duke coach David Cutcliffe said. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen it as long as you watch football. That\u2019s how it happens when a gap\u2019s given up on a short-yardage play and a good back hits it.\u201d\n\nDuke failed to cross midfield on its next two possessions, but forced a punt with about six minutes remaining. Ryan Smith called for a fair catch at midfield but the ball bounced off his pads. Long pounced on it at the Duke 49, and Northwestern ran out the final 5:44.\n\nThe Blue Devils finished with 327 total yards to 271 for Northwestern, but had just 152 in the second half.\n\nSirk finished 24 of 39 for 150 yards with an interception for Duke.\n\nRoss Martin kicked a 38-yard field goal for the Blue Devils, while Jack Mitchell had field goals of 37 and 44 yards for the Wildcats.\n\nClayton Thorson, making his first road start, was 9 of 23 for 70 yards with two interceptions for Northwestern.\n\nJustin Jackson finished with 120 yards rushing for the Wildcats, who rushed for 201 yards against a Duke defense that held its first two opponents to a combined 79 yards on the ground.\n\n\u201cAll the stuff about speed, I think we\u2019re a pretty fast football team,\u201d Fitzgerald said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the thing is about people thinking the Big Ten can\u2019t run. I think we can run.\u201d\n\nThe Wildcats took control of this game late in the first half by forcing two turnovers. A third - Dean Lowry\u2019s scoop-and-score of a deflected screen pass - was overturned after a review determined it was a forward pass.\n\nVault then gave the Wildcats the lead with his big return, though Kyler Brown kept it 9-7 by blocking the extra point.\n\nAnd Northwestern went up by five on Mitchell\u2019s long field goal on its next possession before Martin pulled Duke back within two with his kick on the second play of the fourth quarter.\n\nThe Wildcats entered having allowed a total of two field goals all season, but gave up their first touchdown on Duke\u2019s second possession: Sirk\u2019s scoring run came five plays after DeVon Edwards brought an interception back to the Northwestern 26.\n\nThe teams then combined for 11 straight punts before the Wildcats started forcing turnovers, turning one - Shaun Wilson\u2019s fumble at the Duke 40 - into Mitchell\u2019s shorter field goal with 1:23 left that made it 7-3.\n\n___\n\nFollow Joedy McCreary on Twitter at http://twitter.com/joedyap\n\n___\n\nAP college football website: collegefootball.ap.org", "article_metadata": {"description": "Warren Long touched the ball three times for No. 23 Northwestern - and wound up making two critical plays.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Warren Long touched the ball three times for No. 23 Northwestern - and wound up making two critical plays.", "title": "Long lifts No. 23 Northwestern past Duke, 19-10", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/sep/19/long-lifts-no-23-northwestern-past-duke-19-10/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/19/f5eb6f5b2e077a2a820f6a7067007901.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/19/f5eb6f5b2e077a2a820f6a7067007901.jpg", "description": "Warren Long touched the ball three times for No. 23 Northwestern - and wound up making two critical plays.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Long lifts No. 23 Northwestern past Duke, 19-10"}, "Author": "JOEDY McCREARY", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1362\"", "article_summary": "Long ran 55 yards for a touchdown, then recovered a fumbled punt return to help seal the Wildcats\u2019 19-10 victory over Duke on Saturday.\nLong pounced on it at the Duke 49, and Northwestern ran out the final 5:44.\nClayton Thorson, making his first road start, was 9 of 23 for 70 yards with two interceptions for Northwestern.\nAnd Northwestern went up by five on Mitchell\u2019s long field goal on its next possession before Martin pulled Duke back within two with his kick on the second play of the fourth quarter.\nThe Blue Devils finished with 327 total yards to 271 for Northwestern, but had just 152 in the second half."}
