But we now have five years of evidence to draw upon, and it\u2019s clear that Obama\u2019s methods in this regard have failed miserably. In fact, they\u2019ve worked about as well as Obamacare.\n\nObama\u2019s approach to addressing income inequality, of course, is to funnel ever more money and power to Washington, while promoting a culture of cozy cronyism between Big Government and Big Business (especially Big \u201cGreen\u201d Business). When having a well-positioned team of Washington lawyers and lobbyists becomes a necessary prerequisite to getting ahead, that\u2019s hardly conducive to Main St. prosperity.\n\nThe utter failure of Obama\u2019s trickle-down-government approach is perhaps best captured by two contrasting stats. When he took office, we were a full year into a major recession. Economically, there was almost nowhere to go but up. And, indeed, that\u2019s what the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which tracks the stock prices of 30 very large companies, has done: gone up. In January 2009, the Dow was at about 8,000. It\u2019s now at about 16,000. It has essentially doubled on Obama\u2019s watch.\n\nMeanwhile, according to Census Bureau figures compiled by Sentier Research, the median American household income when the Obama household took up residence at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue in January 2009 was $55,972 (in 2013 dollars). Now, nearly five years later, the median American household income is just $52,529. That\u2019s a decrease of $3,443 \u2013 or more than 6 percent. And that\u2019s during a \u201crecovery\u201d!\n\nIf Americans\u2019 median income were now merely the same (in real dollars) as during the recession, that would mark Obama\u2019s tenure as a miserable economic failure. Instead, Americans\u2019 median income has noticeably dropped.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that these median-income figures include government payments, such as unemployment.\n\nNow, in the face of five years of failure, Obama is pushing for more of the same. His immigration/amnesty push would widen the gap between rich and poor, further squeezing the middle class. His proposals for further government intervention in the economy \u2013 such as through raising the minimum wage \u2013 would make it harder for many people to find work. His administration\u2019s incessant regulatory barrage makes it hard for businesses \u2013 especially small businesses \u2013 to succeed. And then, of course, there\u2019s Obamacare.\n\nWhat\u2019s needed is to stop funneling so much money and power to Washington, get the government out of the way of the efforts of everyday American workers, and get the economy moving in a way that promotes the economic prosperity of the middle class. President Reagan\u2019s famous words ring truer than ever: \u201cIn this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Jeffrey H.
