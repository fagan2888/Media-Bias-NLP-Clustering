The government will spend about $4 trillion this year and distribute benefits to people through more than 2300 programs.\u201d\n\nThen, on top of direct regulatory burdens is something Edwards refers to as \u201cdeadweight loss.\u201d Businesses stay in the market by balancing quality output with costs of manufacturing. When taxes and regulation become part of the equation, it becomes the rational best interest of businesses to make decisions they would not not otherwise. \u201cSince taxes are compulsory, they induce people to try and avoid them by changing their working, investing, and consumption activities.\u201d Edwards estimates a $10 billion energy subsidy program, \u201cputting aside whether the program is ethical or constitutional,\u201d would have a deadweight cost of $5 billion. One of his colleagues, Chris Conover, estimated Obamacare taxes would average $50 billion in deadweight losses a year, \u201cwhich was in addition to the bill\u2019s official cost of about $1 trillion.\u201d Punned Edwards, \u201cCoercion is not free.\u201d\n\nArguments about the appropriateness of government intervention aside, the federal government is widely believed to have failed in sending relief to Hurricane Katrina victims, in preventing 911, and in rolling out Obamacare. Some near-universal criteria offered to judge whether a particular government activity has failed include: (1) bureaucratic problems such as fraud, corruption, and bloated costs, (2) legislative problems such as pork-barrel politics and poor agency oversight, (3) policies that have higher costs than benefits, even if they are well-managed, (4) policies that undermine freedom and prosperity, and (5) policies that intrude on activities better left to the states and private sector.\n\nEdwards cited Clifford Winston of the Brookings Institution\u2019s assessment of federal attempts to \u201ccorrect market failures,\u201d something free marketeers insist would not exist without government meddling in the economy. Winston concluded they cost hundreds of billions of dollars a year. He judged, \u201cpublic financing and management of transportation infrastructure, public lands, and various services have been extremely inefficient,\u201d while \u201credistribution policies have often made little progress in achieving their goals while wasting considerable resources in the process.\u201d\n\nEdwards criticized top-down planning. While coercion certainly has social and moral implications, he stuck to its role in distorting markets. In a free market, prices are set in real time at the micro level as individuals trade value for value. Exchanges are mutually beneficial. When government provides a service, it is paid with taxes, which the general public has little say in agreeing to pay. Without competition for services, the people are stuck paying what government asks, and this eliminates incentives to streamline, stay up-to-date, and engage in other activities private-sector businesses must to remain marketable.\n\nAs a corollary, he addressed the fatal conceit of the few in power presuming to know how to control so many aspects of so many peoples\u2019 lives better than personal choices with ears-to-the-ground data may. He referenced an analogy used by economist Dan Klein. Ice skaters do just fine on a rink. Some fall, but others will rush to the rescue or steer clear, and the skating continues. He contrasted that to a central planner barking orders to all skaters. He could slow things down and limit the number of skaters, but things would be nowhere near as fun. In this situation, it is easy to see that systems of increasing complexity can be best-managed by individuals knowing their own goals and limitations. Applying this to economics, Edwards writes, \u201cWhile markets gather knowledge from the bottom up and are rooted in individual preferences, the government\u2019s actions destroy knowledge and squelch diversity.\u201d\n\nAs for government charity, Edwards quotes the late Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, \u201cIt cannot too often be stated that the issue of welfare is not what it costs those who provide it, but what it costs those who receive it.\u201d Government gets bigger by making people smaller. Standouts in a long list of perverse incentives funded by taxpayer participation include: (1) Foreign aid empowers foreign dictators and stalls reforms, (2) Food aid reduces the incentives for poor countries to feed themselves, (3) Disability benefits encourage people who could work to drop out of the labor force, (4) Social Security and Medicare discourage saving for retirement, (5) Health mandates raise insurance costs and induce firms to drop coverage, (6) Programs for the needy reduce private charity, (6) Workers\u2019 compensation induces workers to be less careful on the job, and (7) Medicare\u2019s set fees encourage doctors to order unnecessary services with less incentive to reduce errors.\n\nReasons suspected for government failure are valid. Edwards talks about politicians putting political careers ahead of national interests. Campaigns cash in on the emotions of the uninformed. Edwards gives people more credit. \u201cPeople know enough to recognize the big-picture problems in Washington, such as the giant federal debt and all the lobbying and corruption. But few people have knowledge about what the best solutions to such problems are. And that is where politicians gain leeway.\u201d Once elected, politicians humor special interests by collecting fractions of a penny from taxpayers. To bring home the bacon, politicians fight for defense manufacturers in their state that make things the Pentagon does not want. Programs proliferate for feel-good, while it takes a huge national scandal to shut anything down.\n\nWhen things go wrong, politicians often blame the bureaucracy. After all, he wrote, \u201cCivil servants act within a bureaucratic system that rewards inertia, not the creation of value. Various reforms over the decades have tried to fix the bureaucracy, but the incentives that generate poor performance are deeply entrenched in the executive branch.\u201d For example, an article in Time magazine called out the Army Corps of Engineers, saying the organization had repeatedly been caught, \u201cskewing its analyses to justify wasteful and destructive projects that keep its employees busy and its congressional patrons happy.\u201d Referring back to Adam Smith\u2019s Invisible Hand, Edwards contrasts this with the free market, where, \u201cA business making misguided investments will be punished by financial losses and may face bankruptcy or a takeover. About 10 percent of all U.S. companies go out of business each year. . . . If government leaders are no more skilled than business leaders, their efforts will also have a high failure rate. But government activities that create no value can live on forever because the funding comes from a mandatory source: taxes.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2e57\"", "article_summary": "In a free market, prices are set in real time at the micro level as individuals trade value for value.\nBut government activities that create no value can live on forever because the funding comes from a mandatory source: taxes.\u201d\nAnd that is where politicians gain leeway.\u201d Once elected, politicians humor special interests by collecting fractions of a penny from taxpayers.\nAfter all, he wrote, \u201cCivil servants act within a bureaucratic system that rewards inertia, not the creation of value.\nHe could slow things down and limit the number of skaters, but things would be nowhere near as fun."}
