He concocted the truly bizarre and elaborate scheme to avoid doing his job while still raking in a generous salary.\n\nThe EPA\u2019s highest paid former employee, John Beale, will be sentenced in a federal court on Wednesday after spending more than ten years taking months off work to do \u201cintelligence work for the CIA in Pakistan,\u201d when he was actually kicking back, reading, riding his bike and relaxing at his vacation home in Cape Cod, NBC News first reported.\n\nBeale, who served as a senior policy adviser in the agency\u2019s Office of Air and Radiation, pled guilty in September to defrauding the federal government out of nearly $900,000 since 2000. Beale retired from his post in April after learning that he was the subject of a federal investigating for defrauding the government by ditching work for months at a time, while still collecting his $200,000 salary (more than EPA administrator Gina McCarthy, his immediate boss.)\n\nIn one instance, Beale disappeared from work for 18-months during which he did \u201cabsolutely no work,\u201d his lawyer, John Kern admitted, according to court files obtained by NBC News.\n\nBeale\u2019s go-to excuse was that he was a CIA operative that required extensive travel to Pakistan and the spy agency\u2019s headquarters in Langley.\n\nAnother time, EPA Assistant Inspector General Patrick Sullivan said Beale emailed McCarthy to tell her he urgently needed to leave for Pakistan because the Taliban was torturing another CIA operative.\n\n\u201cDue to recent events that you have probably read about, I am in Pakistan,\u201d he wrote. \u201cGot the call Thurs and left Fri. Hope to be back for Christmas \u2026.Ho, ho, ho.\u201d\n\nHowever, after a bit of investigating, Sullivan concluded that Beale didn\u2019t have so much as a security clearance. He hadn\u2019t ever been to Langley. And probably hadn\u2019t thought about how a CIA operative would likely not be so open about dispensing information on a top-secret mission in an email.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve worked for the government for 35 years. I\u2019ve never seen a situation like this,\u201d Sullivan told NBC. He said when the EPA finally confronted Beale about his lies earlier this year, he brushed it off and conveniently said he \u201ccouldn\u2019t discuss it.\u201d\n\nRegardless, McCarthy and other agency officials seemed to buy what Beale was selling.\n\nIn a sentencing memo obtained by NBC News, federal prosecutors called Beale\u2019s schemes \u201ca crime of massive proportion that was offensive to those who actually do dangerous work for the CIA.\u201d They want him to serve a prison sentence of at least 30 months.\n\nBut Beale\u2019s CIA-cover wasn\u2019t his only creative excuse. According to NBC, he didn\u2019t show up for work at the EPA for six consecutive months in 2008 because he told his boss he was part of a multi-agency election-year project regarding \u201ccandidate security.\u201d During that stint, he billed the government $57,000 for five trips to California that were \u201cfor personal reasons.\u201d\n\nHe also told EPA officials that he needed to have a special handicap parking spot at EPA\u2019s headquarters because he suffered from malaria, which he contracted while serving in Vietnam. No, he never served in Vietnam.\n\nAhead of the Wednesday sentencing, Beale\u2019s lawyer asked that the court cut his client some slack.\n\n\u201cWith the help of his therapist, Mr. Beale has come to recognize that, beyond the motive of greed, his theft and deception were animated by a highly self-destructive and dysfunctional need to engage in excessively reckless, risky behavior.\u201d Kern wrote. He added that his client was driven \u201cto manipulate those around him through the fabrication of grandiose narratives \u2026 that are fueled by his insecurities.\u201d\n\n(No kidding.)\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "A top executive from the Environmental Protection Agency is likely heading to prison a", "title": "How John Beale Swindled the EPA Out of $1 Million", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2013/12/17/How-John-Beale-Swindled-EPA-Out-1-Million", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/12162013_John_Beale.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2013/12/17/How-John-Beale-Swindled-EPA-Out-1-Million", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/12162013_John_Beale.png", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "A top executive from the Environmental Protection Agency is likely heading to prison a", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "I\u2019ve never seen a situation like this,\u201d Sullivan told NBC.\nIn one instance, Beale disappeared from work for 18-months during which he did \u201cabsolutely no work,\u201d his lawyer, John Kern admitted, according to court files obtained by NBC News.\nAnother time, EPA Assistant Inspector General Patrick Sullivan said Beale emailed McCarthy to tell her he urgently needed to leave for Pakistan because the Taliban was torturing another CIA operative.\nA top executive from the Environmental Protection Agency is likely heading to prison after defrauding the federal government out of nearly $1 million.\nHe said when the EPA finally confronted Beale about his lies earlier this year, he brushed it off and conveniently said he \u201ccouldn\u2019t discuss it.\u201dRegardless, McCarthy and other agency officials seemed to buy what Beale was selling."}
