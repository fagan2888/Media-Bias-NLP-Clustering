As they were going through the photos, researchers also asked participants to identify \u2014 or reminisce \u2014 whether the current faced matched the face in two previous photos. Participants answered both faster and more accurate when matching famous faces compared to anonymous faces, all the while experiencing spikes in their default network.\n\nThis goes to show that accessing long-term memory (famous faces) does work to strengthen short-term memory performance. \"Outside the laboratory, pursuing goals involves processing information filled with personal meaning \u2014 knowledge about past experiences, motivations, future plans, and social context,\" Spreng said. \"Our study suggests that the default network and executive control networks dynamically interact to facilitate an ongoing dialogue between the pursuit of external goals and internal meaning.\"\n\nIt's easy to see why mind-wandering was believed to negatively impact mental peformance. I mean, there's actual evidence. A study published in the Canadian Journal of Experimental Psychology found mind-wandering hinders reading comprehension and performance on working memory- and intelligence-related tests. Interestingly enough, this same study found mind-wandering also played a crucial role when it came to creative problem solving.\n\nIn additional to a better brain, trips down memory lane (however long ago the memory took place) help us feel physically warmer, which makes us feel more optimistic about the future. Remembering the past can lead to more charity donations and overall volunteers, according to a study published in the Journal of Consumer Research.\n\nIn general, though, nostalgia doesn\u2019t even scrape the surface of sweet hacks for a stronger mental performance. Coffee naps, for example, are the premise that if you take a 20-minute nap after consuming a cup of coffee, you\u2019ll maximize caffeine and alertness. Hatha yoga boosts brain function among older adult\u2019s more than exercise, while eating dark chocolate, fish, eggs, tomatoes, and pasta, can level up intelligence, alertness, and focus \u2014 respectively.\n\nSource: Spreng N, DuPre E, Selarka D, Garcia J, Gojkovic S, et al. \"Goal-congruent default network activity facilitates cognitive control.\u201d Journal of Neuroscience, 2014.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "nostalgia, activates, parts, brain, better, mental, performance", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Accessing long-term memories benefits short-term mental performance.", "title": "Trips Down Memory Lane Boost Your Brain", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/nostalgia-activates-parts-brain-better-mental-performance-307890", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/24/polaroid-pictures.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Accessing long-term memories benefits short-term mental performance.", "title": "Trips Down Memory Lane Boost Your Brain", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/nostalgia-activates-parts-brain-better-mental-performance-307890", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/24/polaroid-pictures.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/24/polaroid-pictures.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Science/Tech", "published_time": "2014-10-24T12:40:02-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-24T12:40:01-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Accessing long-term memories benefits short-term mental performance."}, "article_summary": "Cornell University researchers just reversed the idea nostalgia doesn\u2019t activate the parts of your brain responsible for better mental performance; it 100 percent does.\nThis goes to show that accessing long-term memory (famous faces) does work to strengthen short-term memory performance.\n\"Our study is the first to demonstrate the opposite \u2014 that engaging the default network can also improve performance.\"\n\"Goal-congruent default network activity facilitates cognitive control.\u201d Journal of Neuroscience, 2014.\nParticipants answered both faster and more accurate when matching famous faces compared to anonymous faces, all the while experiencing spikes in their default network."}
