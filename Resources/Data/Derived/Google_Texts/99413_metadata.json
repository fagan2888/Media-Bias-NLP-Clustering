And of course, many readers were quick to offer their opinion on the tacos that should have been our 121st.\n\nIt Seems There May Just Be a Few More Tacos to Eat Before You Die . . .\n\nEl Manantial, in Amarillo. Their tacos de birria are a life-changing experience.\n\nAus-Tex Ensey, via texasmonthly.com\n\nEveryone knows Nano\u2019s Taco Run is home to the best breakfast tacos in Corpus Christi.\n\nJonathan Carrillo, via Facebook\n\nThe Original Casa Ma\u00f1ana, home of the Red Taco, in Wichita Falls.\n\nPatrick Fortner, via email\n\nKiki\u2019s, in El Paso.\n\nNikki H., via texasmonthly.com\n\nThe Robert Special and the Carne Ranchera at Los Jacales, in Laredo.\n\nJessica Palacios, via Facebook\n\nTitas Taco House, in Humble.\n\nRebecca Bentley Poire, via Facebook\n\nEl Presidente at Fresa\u2019s, in Austin.\n\nRosemary Martinez, via Facebook\n\nThe carne guisada at El Taco Tejano, in Seguin.\n\nSam Kirkendall, via email\n\nKesos Taco House, in Austin; the place is a win-win.\n\nGaylynn Masceri, via email Tacos Kissi, in Laredo. Trust me. Cristina Herrera, via Facebook\n\nFuzzy\u2019s Taco Shop, in Fort Worth. Also, Melis Taqueria has the best breakfast tacos in town.\n\nThe Taco Saint, via email\n\nOnly 120? The current editors must be from Oklahoma.\n\nGary Brown, via Facebook\n\nGlory Be to the Father, And to the Son\n\n\u201cThe Will of God\u201d is beautiful in so many ways: As a son\u2019s remembrance of the great Will Spong, who died the spring before I entered seminary but was much beloved by every class that preceded mine. As a discussion of grief and how to deal with it (and how not to). And as a work on true religion, on what Jesus was all about, on the power of faithful community, and on real love, the hardest thing to give other people. Thank you, John Spong, for this true and real account of a life that shaped you\u2014and many others. The Episcopal Church and the world are better for Will\u2019s life. May perpetual light shine upon him.\n\nGreg Garrett, via texasmonthly.com\n\nThank you, John, for a piece well written. You have stirred something inside that I don\u2019t exactly know what I\u2019m going to do with. Yet, at the same time, it is a good feeling.\n\nLonging for Hill Country, via texasmonthly.com\n\nOh, Mann\n\nI wish to congratulate Dave Mann for crawling out of his lefty cave long enough to write what he probably thinks is a hatchet job on Senator Cruz [\u201cThe Ted Offensive\u201d]. Well, he failed. What he did accomplish was to remind me of just why I admire and respect the senator. And, sadly for you \u201cprogressives,\u201d what he stands for and says resonates powerfully with most of us Texas voters. Really, Dave, your pronouncement that \u201che seems deeply unpopular with the general electorate\u201d is wishful thinking.\n\nRobert E. Blake, San Antonio\n\nI\u2019m a registered Republican and consider Ted Cruz to be smarmy, slick, and duplicitous. But when Dave Mann states in his rant that \u201cnone of the serious presidential contenders have divorced themselves from fact as often as Cruz has,\u201d I have to say, really? Donald Trump, in his even shorter political career, and Hillary Clinton, in her many decades in the public arena, have both far exceeded Cruz\u2019s best efforts at bending the facts.\n\nMichael Edmonds, Austin\n\nMr. Mann\u2019s politics show through loud and clear as he genuflects at the altar of liberal talking points. For example, he assaults Ted Cruz\u2019s stance on the president\u2019s executive orders not being overturned in court as proof that they must be legal. Guffaw! Mr. Mann attacks Cruz\u2019s\u2014and most Republicans\u2019\u2014call to abolish Obamacare by quoting totally deceptive Bureau of Labor Statistics data to support his position. Mr. Mann needs to realize that Obamacare has, in fact, destroyed millions of vibrant full-time jobs, contributed to one of the lowest labor participation rates in history, and enabled the president to tout 5 percent unemployment when the actual number hovers closer to 9 percent (it\u2019s simple math!). Oh, and Obamacare has helped raise health care costs to an astronomical annual rate.\n\nMr. Mann and his liberal acolytes should stop referring to climate change as scientific fact. Please think back to high school and learning about scientific method. Science deals in theory. There are plenty of explanations\u2014or theories\u2014of warming and cooling trends, and humans are theoretically not the leading causation. Global warming is pure theory, Mr. Mann. You\u2019re welcome to believe it exists, but do not refer to it as fact.\n\nAs to a Washington \u201ccartel,\u201d Cruz is not far off. I lived and worked around Washington, D.C., for forty years, dabbling in its politics, and cartel isn\u2019t far from the truth. Perhaps \u201ccabal\u201d would be a more accurate term, as myriad cabals exist throughout the back rooms of D.C.\n\nMost of the remainder of Mr. Mann\u2019s commentary passes the \u201copinion\u201d litmus test, as he takes issue with Cruz\u2019s political tactics. I do call on Texas Monthly to more clearly label opinion pieces as such.\n\nMark Greathouse, Fairfield, Pennsylvania\n\nNative Scorn\n\nUpon flipping to the back of my just-arrived issue of Texas Monthly, it was with gleeful excitement that I, a native Texan of the wasn\u2019t-born-here-but-got-here-as-soon-as-I-could variety, saw the query posed by Melody (and Tom) Vincent about whether or not Tom was a true Texan [The Texanist]. Without overstating my own intellectual prowess (I did marry a true Texan after all), I prepared to sit back and enjoy what I just knew was going to be a trip down Texas history lane as you answered this simple question.\n\nBut, no! Line after line went by and there was no mention of the Greer County War, where Texas claimed (and rightly so) the area where Altus, Oklahoma, now stands. However, the Supreme Court, as it is sometimes wont to do, sided wrongly with those Okies, and Texas soil somehow turned into Sooner dust. Die-hard Texans, like my husband, refuse to acknowledge this travesty of justice. After birthing our first three kids in Texas, we felt safe in calling our little Sarah a native Texan, even though she made her first appearance at Altus Air Force Base. So, Tom, be comforted by the fact that you are truly a native-born Texan.\n\nOn a side note, the Air Force took us all the way to Germany, and my Aggie husband, an Eagle Scout and always prepared, brought along a Ziploc bag full of Texas dirt. We have no doubt that Claudia, our fifth and last child, is also, like you, Tom, a native-born Texan, because she was \u201cborn over Texas soil.\u201d With the permission of our doctor, my husband placed the bag, wrapped in a sterile sheet, in a strategic location just at the proper moment. Aggie ingenuity at its finest!\n\nSusan Fain, Fort Worth\n\nI love the Texanist and his column and I agree with his answers and observations 99.5 percent of the time. But his answer in the December issue to the lady who discovered that her fianc\u00e9 was not a native Texan on the day they got their marriage license slammed headlong into the .5 percent pile.\n\nI am a fourth-generation native Texan, having taken my first breath in the old Cook Hospital in Cleburne, so I can speak with some authority. Unless one slips from his mother\u2019s womb while inside the recognized boundaries of the state of Texas, he is NOT a Texan, no matter how much he wants to be. Just an inch outside the lines is grounds for disqualification. Length of residence doesn\u2019t count, and changing planes at DFW doesn\u2019t bestow that honorary degree on you either. Neither does wearing boots or buying a ranch in the Hill Country.\n\nThe list of historical figures and their accomplishments for the state doesn\u2019t mean a thing. Calling folks \u201cTexans\u201d who weren\u2019t born here sorta cheapens the bragging rights of us real Texans.\n\nI love you, man, but you sidestepped that one.\n\nBob Stepp, now residing in Michigan, where I can speak one sentence and they can guess where I\u2019m from", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.categories": "The Culture,", "sailthru.author": "Texas Monthly Staff", "description": "Readers respond to the December 2015 issue.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "sailthru.link": "http://www.texasmonthly.com/the-culture/readers-weigh-in-with-their-favorite-tacos/", "og": {"site_name": "Texas Monthly", "description": "Readers respond to the December 2015 issue.", "title": "Roar of the Crowd - Texas Monthly", "locale": "en_US", "url": "http://www.texasmonthly.com/the-culture/readers-weigh-in-with-their-favorite-tacos/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Readers respond to the December 2015 issue.", "card": "summary", "title": "Roar of the Crowd - Texas Monthly"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-12-23 13:10:01", "robots": "noodp", "sailthru.title": "Roar of the Crowd", "sailthru.tags": "Tacos,Ted Cruz,The Texanist,will spong,The Culture,The Culture,", "article": {"section": "The Culture", "tag": "will spong", "published_time": "2015-12-23T13:10:01-05:00"}, "sailthru.description": "Readers respond to the December 2015 issue.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "tacos, ted cruz, the texanist, will spong, texas, politics, food"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd15ee\"", "article_summary": "Mr. Mann attacks Cruz\u2019s\u2014and most Republicans\u2019\u2014call to abolish Obamacare by quoting totally deceptive Bureau of Labor Statistics data to support his position.\nI am a fourth-generation native Texan, having taken my first breath in the old Cook Hospital in Cleburne, so I can speak with some authority.\nGlobal warming is pure theory, Mr. Mann.\nMr. Mann and his liberal acolytes should stop referring to climate change as scientific fact.\nRoar of the CrowdReaders respond to the December 2015 issue."}
