Far from it.\n\nBombast, bravado and arrogance aside, he\u2019s like all other candidates from both parties - pro-war, pro-business, anti-populist, mindless of what matters most to ordinary Americans. Intending dirty business as usual if elected.\n\nThe most important issue all aspirants oppose is government of, by and for everyone equitably and fairly - with special concern for society\u2019s most disadvantaged, a vital safety net for people needing it most.\n\nOnTheIssues.org gives Trump\u2019s views on nearly two dozen issues. He claims he\u2019ll be \u201cthe greatest jobs president that God ever created.\u201d He\u2019s pro-life except for rape, incest or health - against same-sex marriage.\n\nHe favors eliminating corporate taxes altogether - absurdly claiming it\u2019ll create millions of jobs. Companies hire based on business prospects and needs, not how much or little they\u2019re taxed. He also wants inheritance taxes abolished for obvious reasons.\n\nHe\u2019s a tough on crime proponent - apparently wanting the world\u2019s biggest gulag enlarged, mostly with people of color unable to afford expensive attorneys to get them off the hook for virtually anything.\n\nHe favors legalizing illicit drugs - a sensible policy. People have a right to treat their bodies anyway they wish no matter how potentially harmful.\n\nHe supports corporate run schools replacing public ones. Democracy and an educated citizenry go hand in hand. Public education is the great equalizer. America\u2019s founders believed it was insurance against losing liberty.\n\nFather of American education Horace Mann called \u201c(t)he common school\u2026the greatest discovery ever made by man.\u201d Trump wants it made another profit center.\n\nHe calls climate change a hoax. Oil is the country\u2019s lifeblood, he claims. He favors unlimited drilling and production.\n\nHis foreign policy is unabashedly hardline - pro-war. He calls himself \u201cthe most militaristic person in this race.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s against the Iran nuclear deal, urges tougher sanctions, supports Israel\u2019s worst crimes, calls China America\u2019s enemy, surprisingly isn\u2019t anti-Russian.\n\nHe\u2019d \u201cget along very well with Vladimir Putin,\u201d he said. \u201cHillary Clinton\u2026was the worst Secretary of State in the history of the country,\u201d he claims. \u201cThe world blew apart during her reign. Now she wants to be president\u201d to finish destroying what\u2019s left.\n\nHe wants a 20% tax on all imported goods, a 35% tax on Mexican products - a surefire prescription for trade war, followed by global depression.\n\nHe advocates near unrestricted gun ownership rights. He calls Obamacare a catastrophe vital to repeal. He\u2019s for greater military spending, tougher homeland security policies, likely more freedom abolishing police state laws.\n\nHe wants public assistance for America\u2019s most needy restricted - limited in amount and duration. He says undocumented immigrants (meaning Latinos) \u201chave to go.\u201d\n\nHe released a position paper titled \u201cImmigration Reform that Will Make America Great Again\u201d - listing \u201cthree core principles:\u201d\n\n(1) A wall on America\u2019s border with Mexico - making its government cover construction costs, ignoring destructive NAFTA policies forcing unemployed Mexicans to come north for work, claiming Mexican authorities \u201cexport the crime and poverty in their own country.\u201d\n\n(2) Tougher immigration laws to keep unwanted Latinos and other people of color out, more Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operatives for escalated police state terror on immigrant communities and workplaces, as well as greater numbers of deportations.\n\n3. Serve Americans first. \u201cA nation that does not serve its own citizens is not a nation,\u201d he says - without explaining which ones he means.\n\nIn his book titled \u201cA Nation of Immigrants,\u201d Jack Kennedy explained all Americans are immigrants or descendants of immigrant families. He called national origin quotas based on racial preferences indefensible.\n\nEmma Lazarus\u2019 famous words on Lady Liberty\u2019s pedestal once had meaning. No longer for Trump and likeminded ideologues hostile to the tired, the poor, the huddled masses yearning to breath free. They urge extinguishing the lamp beside America\u2019s golden door - except for the privileged few they favor.\n\nThey want national policies benefitting its monied interests alone - at the expense of all others.\n\n-###-\n\nStephen Lendman lives in Chicago and can be reached at lendmanstephen@sbcglobal.net.\n\nHis new book as editor and contributor is titled \"Flashpoint in Ukraine: How the US Drive for Hegemony Risks World War III \".\n\nhttp://www.claritypress.com/LendmanIII.html\n\nVisit his blog site at sjlendman.blogspot.com.\n\nListen to cutting-edge discussions with distinguished guests on the Progressive Radio News Hour on the Progressive Radio Network.\n\nIt airs three times weekly: live on Sundays at 1PM Central time plus two prerecorded archived programs", "article_metadata": {"generator": "b2evolution 6.6.6-stable"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca063\"", "article_summary": "He wants public assistance for America\u2019s most needy restricted - limited in amount and duration.\nNo longer for Trump and likeminded ideologues hostile to the tired, the poor, the huddled masses yearning to breath free.\nFather of American education Horace Mann called \u201c(t)he common school\u2026the greatest discovery ever made by man.\u201d Trump wants it made another profit center.\nIn his book titled \u201cA Nation of Immigrants,\u201d Jack Kennedy explained all Americans are immigrants or descendants of immigrant families.\nOnTheIssues.org gives Trump\u2019s views on nearly two dozen issues."}
