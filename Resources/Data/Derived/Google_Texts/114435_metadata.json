The game was part of the 23rd annual Bubba's Bash. (Brandon Hopper/Daily Record)\n\nTigers pitcher Lucas Bufmack earned a tough-luck loss on Saturday, the kind no one deserves but someone must take after a pitchers' duel.\n\nTwo unearned runs crossed the plate in the top of the fifth inning for the Four Corners Club Sox and it was enough as pitcher Cam Baird shut down the Tigers for a 2-0 victory in the 23rd annual Bubba's Bash at Justin Field.\n\n\u201cHe was a high-velocity kind of kid, mid-80s or so, somewhere in that area,\u201d Tigers coach Tim Ritter said of Baird, the more dominant pitcher of the morning game. \u201cIt's tough for our kids when they're swinging wood and they're not used to that (velocity). \u2026 I liked how we competed \u2013 we put the ball in play for the most part.\u201d\n\nThe loss dropped the Tigers to 1-2 on the tournament and they finished third in the National League division behind South Denver and Four Corners. The Tigers' win came against Hays, Kansas on Thursday after they lost in extra innings to South Denver. Ca\u00f1on City missed finishing in the top two of its division for the first time in at least five years. The top teams from both divisions will play Sunday to decide the champion.\n\nCa\u00f1on City will play Sunday, too. Its game will be against Vista Ridge, which Ca\u00f1on City played last week in a doubleheader split.\n\nBufmack needed to work out of some tight jams early, and his defense helped him out multiple times. He was able to leave the bases loaded full of Sox in the first inning and picked off a runner in the second to end that frame.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the third inning, a leadoff error followed by a stolen base found the Sox with a runner at second and nobody out. Bufmack induced pop-outs to right-fielder Michael Green, first baseman Trace Hildebrand and catcher Zach Manchester to end the threat.\n\nCa\u00f1on City's defense made some big plays to save runs in the fourth inning. With nobody out and runners at first and second, Manchester caught a runner trying to steal third. That was followed by a diving catch by Green in right field and a putout from Cameron Brosh to Hildebrand, where Hildebrand made a nifty scoop to save a run.\n\nThe Tigers left runners in scoring position in the first, second and fourth innings and the Sox made them pay for it in the fifth. After a leadoff runner reached on an error and a moved up on a wild pitch, a two-out triple scored the opening run of the game. That was followed by a double and it gave Baird all the run support necessary.\n\nBufmack was pulled after that in favor of Michael Hawver, who limited the damage to only two runs. Ritter said both pitchers threw well.\n\nOn the other side, will-be college sophomore Baird finished the game with 11 strikeouts and allowed only four hits.\n\nThe crossover games have been decided and the Tigers will play the Wolves at 9:30 a.m. Sunday. Pueblo West and 4 Corners will match up at 11:45 a.m. and South Denver and Mitchell will play at 2:30 p.m. The winners of the final two games will meet for the championship.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/canoncity-sports/ci_28305297/canon-city-tigers-lucas-bufmack-fall-4-corners", "modificationDate": "2015-06-14T11:54:19-0600", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2015/0613/20150613_035613_08-DSC_9983-3597_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By Brandon Hopper \n \n  The Daily Record", "description": "Tigers pitcher Lucas Bufmack earned a tough-luck loss on Saturday, the kind no one deserves but someone must take after a pitchers' duel.", "ag": {"canon": "CanonCityDailyRecord:article:28305297:view"}, "startDate": "2015-06-13T15:55:40-0600", "og": {"url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/canoncity-sports/ci_28305297/canon-city-tigers-lucas-bufmack-fall-4-corners", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2015/0613/20150613_035613_08-DSC_9983-3597.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Tigers pitcher Lucas Bufmack earned a tough-luck loss on Saturday, the kind no one deserves but someone must take after a pitchers' duel.", "title": "Ca\u00f1on City Tigers, Lucas Bufmack fall to 4 Corners Club Sox, 2-0"}, "twitter": {"domain": "canoncitydailyrecord.com", "description": "Tigers pitcher Lucas Bufmack earned a tough-luck loss on Saturday, the kind no one deserves but someone must take after a pitchers' duel.", "title": "Ca\u00f1on City Tigers, Lucas Bufmack fall to 4 Corners Club Sox, 2-0", "url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/canoncity-sports/ci_28305297/canon-city-tigers-lucas-bufmack-fall-4-corners", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2015/0613/20150613_035613_08-DSC_9983-3597.jpg", "site": "@CCDR_news", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-06-13T15:55:40-0600", "sailthru.site": "canoncitydailyrecord.com", "endDate": "2015-06-27T15:55:40-0600", "sailthru.title": "Ca\u00f1on City Tigers, Lucas Bufmack fall to 4 Corners Club Sox, 2-0", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Sports", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "oCjqPZ-ii-IZW-fBJ0mmX5dmH5aafePG3FLx_kSYFiA", "byline": "By Brandon HopperThe", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2015/0613/20150613_035613_08-DSC_9983-3597.jpg", "pubDate": "2015-06-13T15:58:27-0600", "news_keywords": "Canyon City news, Colorado news, world news, national news, local news, business news, sports news, entertainment news, us news, Canyon City Daily Record"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd300b\"", "article_summary": "Lucas Bumack during the Canon City Tigers' baseball game against the 4 Corners Club Sox on Saturday at Justin Field.\nThe crossover games have been decided and the Tigers will play the Wolves at 9:30 a.m. Sunday.\nCa\u00f1on City missed finishing in the top two of its division for the first time in at least five years.\nPueblo West and 4 Corners will match up at 11:45 a.m. and South Denver and Mitchell will play at 2:30 p.m.\nAdvertisementIn the third inning, a leadoff error followed by a stolen base found the Sox with a runner at second and nobody out."}
