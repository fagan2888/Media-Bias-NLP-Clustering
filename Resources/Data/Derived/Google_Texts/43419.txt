Couples in Florida who live together and are unmarried no longer have to worry about committing a crime. “Shacking up” is now legal in Florida.

Governor Rick Scott signed a bill into law that repeals Florida’s 148-year-old ban on unwed couples living together.

The crime of co-habitation was hardly ever prosecuted, but according to the letter of the law, it was a second-degree misdemeanor punishable by up to 60 days in jail or a $500 fine. The law was first passed in 1868 and the punishment was up to two years in prison and a $300 fine.

Because of the way the law was worded, the law did not apply to same-sex couples.

“If any man and woman, not being married to each other, lewdly and lasciviously associate and cohabit together, they shall be guilty of a second degree misdemeanor,” the former law stated.

During the session, Richard Stark, Democrat, co-sponsored the repeal and argued on the House floor that the ban had affected not just young singles but seniors as well.

“I represent communities of seniors, where a lot of them are technically not married,” Stark said. “They are living together, but it makes more sense financially or for whatever reason like Social Security to not be married. I don’t think that they want to be considered to be violating the law.”

The measure passed unanimously in the Senate but drew five “no” votes in the House, all from Republicans, including Republican Jennifer Sullivan of Mount Dora, the youngest member of the Legislature at 24.

Scott signed the bill without issuing a comment.

Bills to repeal the cohabitation ban have been floated in the Legislature in recent years but were never consummated. The repeal leaves Michigan and Mississippi as the only states left with cohabitation bans still on the books.
