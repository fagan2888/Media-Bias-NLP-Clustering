Instead, it will offer outpatient services in conjunction with Palomar Health and Tri-City Medical Center, significantly larger hospital operators in the region.\n\n\"Smaller and independent hospitals are going to continue to fall by the wayside,\" Glenn Melnick, a healthcare economist with the University of Southern California, told the Union-Tribune. \"This trend will accelerate because you've got to be part of a big network that has deep enough pockets to bear that risk.\"\n\nHospitals lose money on patients insured by Medi-Cal, the state's Medicaid program, as well as Medicare, according to the Union-Tribune. And smaller facilities tend to struggle to get favorable rates from private payers to provide enough cash flow to continue to survive.\n\nThat has pushed smaller hospitals and systems--with annual revenue of less than $4 billion a year--to seek partnerships with larger providers, observers say.
