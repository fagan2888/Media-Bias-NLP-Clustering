Just 25 minutes after a woman bailed out of jail in Fort Collins on a charge of driving under the influence of drugs following a car crash, she and two relatives allegedly attacked two people with a baseball bat, including the woman whose SUV she crashed in the traffic accident.

Tanicia Carter, 36, was returned to the Larimer County Jail, where she is being held without bond for investigation of first-degree burglary, theft, assault, criminal mischief and violation of bond conditions, said Sgt. Michael Rairdon of the sheriff’s office.

Her alleged accomplices included her brother, Therion Carter, 30, and his wife, Lakaiya Saunders, 29. They are being held in the same jail for investigation of first-degree burglary and second-degree assault, Rairdon said. Saunders also faces a theft allegation.

The assault victims, including a 40-year-old man and his 34-year-old wife, have not been identified. They were treated for assault injuries, Rairdon said.

The couple were staying in Carter’s home until Thursday afternoon, when Carter crashed a gray Chevrolet Tahoe that belonged to the female victim into two parked cars on the 8300 block of 3rd Street and was arrested, Rairdon said. The female victim was a passenger in the SUV at the time. One of the cars was occupied by two children.

After the crash, the victims left Saunders’ house and went to a home in Wellington to stay.

Carter was released on bond at 10:16 p.m., Rairdon said.

At 10:41 p.m. someone called 911 reporting the bat attack at the Wellington home on the 4000 block of Garfield Avenue.
