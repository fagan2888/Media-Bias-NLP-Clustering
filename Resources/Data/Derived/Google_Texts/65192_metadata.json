Morse, MD, the immediate past chair of the AAO Ethics Committee and executive vice president of AAPOS.\n\nMorse gave colleagues at the American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus meeting practical tips for those who would consider becoming an expert witness.\n\nChristie L. Morse\n\n\u201c[A standard of care] is what a reasonable peer physician would recommend under similar circumstances,\u201d she said, adding that an objective basis needs to be established that is evidence based as well as a community standard.\n\nThe expert witness is selected for expertise in a particular discipline and is allowed to offer opinion. It is important for there to be a medical expert to assist the court, she said, so he or she may define the standard of care and interpret and evaluate meaning and relevance of data.\n\n\u201cWith providing expert witness testimony, there are really significant responsibilities,\u201d she said.\n\nAccording to Morse, there are common pitfalls that expert witnesses should avoid: misrepresenting training or experience; being unfamiliar with the intricacies of the specialty of concern; viewing the case with tunnel vision, which causes one to miss the larger clinical picture; confusing personal opinion or preference with the legal standard of care; allowing oneself to be encouraged by the attorney; resisting answering truthfully or objectively; allowing personal relationships or competitive issues to bias testimony; underestimating the comprehension level of the judge, jury or other side; and accepting compensation that is contingent on the outcome of a trial.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, the trial judge is the gatekeeper,\u201d Morse said. \u201cIt\u2019s really the job of the judge to figure out if an expert is a credible expert.\u201d \u2013 by Patricia Nale, ELS\n\nReference: Morse CL.
