The free-enterprise system has been a mainstay of American culture since its inception. For centuries, Americans have proudly passed down to the next generation the valuable model of entrepreneurship and capitalism as a worthy, fulfilling and American aspiration. But the greatest country on earth faces foes from within her borders that directly fight against sound economic principles and the freedom afforded by those principles that have made America a beacon of hope for millions of Americans.\n\nEvery generation endured its share of \u201cAmerica bashers,\u201d people who find fault with and hate on America because of her exceptionalism. Typical bashers include liberal politicians, elitist socialist college professors and Hollywood A-listers. They often defame individualism and capitalism and deride the very freedoms and opportunities that enabled them to arrive at their station in life.\n\nOf these liberal/socialist pickings is anti-capitalist movie producer Michael Moore. Moore has used filmmaking to trumpet his moronic message that capitalism is evil. However, Moore, quite literally, made an \u201cevil\u201d fortune \u2013 to the tune of $50 million \u2013 by bashing our free-enterprise system and tweeted to his followers that \u201ccapitalism is a crime.\u201d Twitchy reported that \u201cOver the last [four] years, Moore has called for revolution, demanded that rich people be arrested and thrown in jail, called for a 50 percent top marginal tax rate and frequently expressed his own hatred and disgust with the United States.\u201d\n\nOne freedom-loving, Reaganomics filmmaker is taking Moore (and Obama) to task.\n\nChattanooga native Melanie Tipton is producing a documentary extolling the virtues of capitalism while decrying Moore\u2019s socialist hateful propaganda against capitalism.\n\nMelanie\u2019s \u201cJourney Through Chattanoogaville\u201d documentary will show the rigors of a small-business owner persevering in today\u2019s weak economy. Tipton is the owner of Soar On The Wings Of Eagles and is the executive producer of the documentary. She has over 15 years of television broadcast experience and is a first place Associated Press award-winning television sportscaster.\n\nTipton states, \u201cThis documentary will be the opposite of liberal Michael Moore\u2019s propaganda film against capitalism. Our documentary is going to promote the greatness of America through the eyes of capitalism. The answer to America\u2019s struggling economy is returning to Ronald Reagan\u2019s economic policies known as Reaganomics. The documentary will show that government does not drive economic growth; instead, growth comes from the private sector.\u201d\n\nAnd on Obama, Tipton says, \u201cOur own president declared in 2008 the \u2018fundamental transformation of the nation\u2019 \u2013 aka socialism \u2013 and in recent years has stated that free-market capitalism and individual entrepreneurship does not and never has worked successfully for America and its people. And let\u2019s not forget Obama\u2019s famous rant during an election campaign event in 2012 to people who create and build businesses: \u2018If you\u2019ve got a business, you didn\u2019t build that.\u2019 Tell that to the SBE, which reports that in 2011 \u2019employer firms with less than 20 workers made up 89.8 percent\u2019 of the economy, and \u2018non-employer firms with less than 20 employees\u2019 made up 98 percent.\u201d\n\nTipton continues, \u201cAfter hearing Obama\u2019s words and seeing America on its destructive path, anyone can see the objective is to move America away from a nation built on individual liberty and economic freedom and toward a government welfare and dependency state.\u201d\n\nAccording to Tipton, \u201cThe three demographics that have been hurt the worst under Obama\u2019s economic policies are single women, minorities and young people. That\u2019s why a documentary on capitalism is needed in America to counteract the socialist message that the far left, including Michael Moore and Obama, are selling these days. America is built on capitalism, and that\u2019s what makes the United States great and sets it apart from other countries. We will show in this documentary that capitalism and free enterprise are the backbone of America.\u201d\n\nShe continues, \u201cThis documentary will help show the world that President Obama and his leftist agenda is wrong. It will prove that capitalism and individual entrepreneurship does work, and striving to live the American dream can still be accomplished through hard work and determination.\u201d\n\nCurrently, our economy under Obama is suffering, but the president blames Republicans for not supporting his proposals for a higher minimum wage or extending unemployment benefits. The president\u2019s proposals do not reflect Reaganomics \u2013 which was the greatest economic policy ever. Instead, Obama\u2019s proposals are detrimental to small business owners \u2013 which make up almost 50 percent of the GDP \u2013 and advocate prolonged government dependency. Obama-NO-mics touts Obamacare as sound economic policy, when in reality Obamacare is a job killer. Obamacare increases cost, provides fewer doctors and offers less health care for women.\n\nAmerica needs a return to Reaganomics or this vicious cycle of liberal socialist sellout of America will set us in a permanent place of no return. Tipton\u2019s documentary is a ray of hope pointing to a Reaganomics recovery, starting in Chattanooga and hopefully spreading far and wide.\n\nMedia wishing to interview Selena Owens, please contact media@wnd.com.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"url": "http://www.wnd.com/2014/07/reaganomics-what-america-needs/", "site_name": "WND", "type": "article", "description": "Capitalism is the crux of America\u2019s economy.
