However, the cost reports are not easily understood by everyday consumers, who use Nursing Home Compare to evaluate facilities.\n\nThe staffing issue has been a hot topic, following an August New York Times article that claimed nursing homes \u201cstaff up\u201d prior to surveys to boost their ratings. That led to an outcry from lawmakers, who pointed out that the Affordable Care Act calls for verification of staffing data.\n\nProminent long-term care associations challenged some of the New York Times reporting but supported verification of data. The recently passed IMPACT Act calls for electronic submission of staffing data, officials from the American Health Care Association/National Center for Assisted Living and LeadingAge pointed out.\n\n\"We are optimistic that the new IMPACT law will go a long way in addressing these discrepancies so we have an even better system to present meaningful data to patients and families. That's the end goal,\u201d AHCA/NCAL Senior Vice President of Public Affairs Greg Crist said in an email to McKnight's.\n\nLeadingAge has \u201clong expressed concerns over how staffing levels are reported\u201d and supported the IMPACT provisions, stated Cheryl Phillips, M.D., senior vice president of advocacy and public policy.\n\n\u201cWe believe that staffing is the platform to quality care,\u201d Phillips added in her comment to McKnight's. \u201cFurthermore, multiple studies ... have recognized that non-profits consistently have higher staffing ratios than for-profit nursing home providers.\u201d\n\nClick here to access the Center for Public Integrity article on its investigation.
