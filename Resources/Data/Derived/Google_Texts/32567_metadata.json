(Photo: Jay Calderon/The Desert Sun)Buy Photo\n\nKaron Neumeister, 64, doesn't know how she contracted hepatitis. There's no way to trace it back. Maybe she was as young as 4 years old \u2014 in and out of the hospital undergoing surgeries.\n\nBut the Desert Hot Springs resident knows the infectious disease, spread through blood-to-blood contact, has scarred her liver and inner organs, causing cirrhosis and cancer that left her with severe abdominal pain.\n\nSince December, Neumeister has been treated at a Borrego Community Health Foundation clinic, a site years in the making that opened in the city last fall. Without health care access just five minutes away, she would have abstained from regular treatment. \"I'm blessed \u2026 that we do have a doctor this close,\" she said, her voice growing shakier as tears formed.\n\nThe clinic is the latest in a series of changes in Desert Hot Springs health care as the area that just a few years ago had a ratio of one doctor per 9,440 residents has moved to one per 4,000. Additional facilities over the next year are expected to improve the ratio to one per 3,000, officially removing the area's designation as federally underserved.\n\nThere are still challenges and gaps going forward, though, as the federal Affordable Care Act is expected to send thousands of people who typically have used emergency rooms into primary care, possibly threatening the already-fragile infrastructure. And, despite progress, the physician shortage remains dire in the eastern Coachella Valley in farmworker communities such as Mecca and Oasis. Residents still struggle to get in to see doctors, even as health leaders place their sights and dollars on long-term solutions.\n\n\"It is one thing for people to have the ability to see and receive services from health care providers,\" said Glen Grayman, president of the board of the Health Assessment Resource Center (HARC) and vice-president of the Desert Healthcare District board. \"It's another thing to have those health care providers available to them.\"\n\nSand-blown roads stretch north out of Palm Springs where a decades-old hospital serves the community of Desert Hot Springs, where about 20,000 people live and, until the clinic opened recently, patients had little to nowhere to turn.\n\nIn 2013, 11.6 percent of Desert Hot Springs residents, or 2,597 people, still struggled to receive health care because of transportation, according to HARC data. Another 15.3 percent, or 3,145 people, said they couldn't see a doctor because of the office hours.\n\n\"It provides the community something that's really lacking here,\" said Dr. Clayton Barbour, a specialist at the Borrego clinic. \"There's not many doctors here as far as private practice and even less as far as patients who have Medi-Cal (insurance).\"\n\nWhen the wind's blowing, it can be hard for some patients to get to Palm Springs for treatment, he said. Roads such as Gene Autry Trail and Indian Canyon Drive that lead into the city often close during heavy dust and sand storms. This journey specially difficult for people who are sick.\n\nNeumeister, retired from her work dabbling in real estate with her contractor husband, lost her insurance three years ago when she could no longer keep up with monthly premiums of $800. After that, she started visiting the Riverside County hospital, located about 45 miles west in Moreno Valley.\n\nHer case was pending for more than a year there, she said, and they did not know when she would hear back.\n\n\"It takes forever to deal with the county,\" she said.\n\nIn the meantime, she would have her husband take her to receive health care, drives that would prove to be a hassle for the ill Neumeister. Her husband would have to drive slowly to avoid causing her pain.\n\nEarly last year, Neumeister's doctors grew worried. She was exhausted and could not wake up in the morning.She was told her hepatitis was progressing and changing, and was diagnosed with liver cancer. She then underwent surgery to remove it.\n\nAbout six months later, she signed up for insurance through the Covered California exchange under the ACA. She was referred to the Borrego clinic, the only provider in Desert Hot Springs that accepts the new insurances, according to clinic staff.\n\nShe said she thinks she would have died if it hadn't been for her new insurance and care.\n\nOn new medication, Neumeister's viral load \u2014 a telling measurement that shows how much infection is traceable in her blood stream, with lower numbers being healthier \u2014 has dropped from 400,000 to 15.\n\n\"I feel so much better and have energy again for the first time in a couple years,\" Neumeister said.\n\n'This is for us?'\n\nThe beige, 18-room Borrego clinic on Pierson Boulevard offers family practice care, pediatrics, urgent care and women's health, as well as immunization, X-rays and specialty care for HIV and AIDS patients. A team of doctors listens to patients, evaluating breathing, blood levels and health. Children wait in the front office, playing with beads, laughing and watching television while their parents fill out paperwork.\n\nIt averages 60-90 patients each day and remains open on weekends, from 8 a.m. to noon on Saturdays and Sundays.\n\n\"Usually people don't see a nice big clinic in a community like this one, so the fact that we came in and we opened the clinic and everything was new, they feel like, 'This is for us?'\" said Sergio Ruiz, clinic manager.\n\nJust a few miles away lies a $25 million community health and wellness center. Opened in January 2013, the center provides Desert Hot Springs residents with preventive health features such as a cardiac fitness gym and aquatic center, as well as dental services and four operatories for teen health.\n\n\"The thing is before, when it was so difficult to get to see anybody, you kind of gave up and just didn't go see anyone at all,\" said Mark Cohen, a long-term AIDS survivor since the 1980s and a patient at Borrego. \"You didn't go get your medicines.\n\n\"Now there is someone close by that can help you, whereas before there was no one,\" he said.\n\nDesert Hot Springs residents can also receive X-rays for possible fractures at the new clinic, whereas they previously would have visited the emergency room, Ruiz said. That saves them about 10 hours.\n\nOther insured residents would travel for X-rays and lab work about 10 miles \u2014 a 20-minute drive \u2014 to Desert Advanced Imaging and other offices in Palm Springs.\n\nAbout two to four or five physicians practice out of the clinic daily, with two coming to Desert Hot Springs specifically for its creation, staff said. They try to keep the wait to a minimum for patients, but waits sometimes still occur.\n\nThe clinic can handle up to eight to 10 providers.\n\n\"We're always looking for more,\" Dr. Barbour said. \"We could probably add another clinician or two up here easily.\"\n\nThey hope to add a pharmacy, recruit more physicians and continue to grow medical practices out of the clinic over the next year, especially as more people become insured and look for health care, staff said.\n\n\"It certainly appears that the situation regarding health care access (in Desert Hot Springs) has substantially improved within a very short period of time, within the last few years, and it appears to be on a trajectory to keep improving,\" Grayman said.\n\nThe Desert Healthcare District has infused $8.9 million over the past decade to improve health in the struggling area as part of a place-based initiative, creating a health plan, funding mental health services and clinics, among other efforts. It has also funded oversampling questions for the 2016 Coachella Valley Community Health Monitor from the Health Assessment Resource Center.\n\nDoctors needed in east valley\n\nAs some DHS residents have started to find the health care they've been lacking for decades, community members down Highway 111 in the Coachella Valley's rural eastern towns are growing frustrated with what they see as a static problem, wondering if help will ever come.\n\nHundreds wait overnight \u2014 year after year \u2014 at annual clinics run by charity groups such as Flying Doctors and California CareForce where volunteers gather at high schools and fairgrounds to triage patients, remove teeth, perform vision tests, listen to nagging coughs and dole out medications for ever-present diabetes and asthma sufferers.\n\nUnder the still-blistering shade of desert palm trees, miles from where celebrities gather in flower crowns to listen to live music at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival and presidents and former presidents golf on lush, green courses, some openly wonder whether or not they would be dead by now if it weren't for the free care.\n\nThe impoverished communities made up of mostly Latino agricultural workers have struggled with health insurance, missing out on health care because they are unable to cover doctors costs out-of-pocket on low wages. The problem is further complicated by difficulties in seeing physicians because of a severe physician shortage, transportation issues and long wait times that people who work in the fields just don't have.\n\nA 2010 health-access report conducted by Rep. Raul Ruiz, then an emergency-room physician at Eisenhower Medical Center, found there was 1 doctor for every 8,407 residents in the east valley.\n\nThere is just one emergency room to serve the entire east valley of about 60,000 people, based out of John F. Kennedy Memorial Hospital in Indio.\n\nThat's too far for people in Mecca, for example, to travel for an emergency, said Manuela Ramirez, a promotora, or community health worker and educator based in Thermal.\n\nThe physician-to-patient ratio in the JFK service area has reached 1 doctor per 1,653 patients with a total of 122 doctors in the area, according to the hospital's latest 2013-2014 data report. That's a big boost for the area.\n\nBut the figures look at La Quinta, Indio, Coachella and Thermal, a large, rural area of roughly 102 miles and thousands of people. It also does not include east valley communities such as Mecca and North Shore.\n\nThose doctors tend to be more heavily concentrated in Indio and La Quinta, leaving the impoverished unincorporated communities, where many live on less than $15,000 annually, without doctors and long distances to travel for care.\n\nThe California Institute for Rural Studies and Loma Linda University, in partnership with the California Endowment, launched a comprehensive regional health survey of the east valley earlier this month to get accurate neighborhood-based answers on health. They will survey 1,750 households, including often-ignored backhouses and trailers, in Thermal, Oasis and Coachella over the next two years.\n\nOne of the questions surveyors will ask will be how far household members have to travel for health care and where they go, a roundabout way of studying the shortage in some of the most vulnerable areas.\n\n\"We need more (doctors); we need a lot, not just one or two; it's a lot of people,\" said Ramirez, one of the surveyors for the project. \"The community is growing.\"\n\nMore neighborhoods keep cropping up, she said, and more parks line up beside long stretches of roads. But no more clinics or hospitals.\n\n\"It's probably going to stay the same,\" Ramirez said.\n\nOff Grapefruit Boulevard in Mecca, down a dirt and gravel path bearing a stark white sign announcing the St. Anthony's Trailer Park, Amelia Ceja and her neighbor Guadalupe Rosales sit and chat on white lawn chairs. As the setting sun beats down over the surrounding mountains, fields and trailers, the neighbors commiserate over health care in the area, pausing to greet other neighbors in the tight-knit community, share laughs and swat flies away.\n\nCeja, 38, picks grapes by day, and chiles when there's work in that, in \"los campos\" and watches her four sons, ranging from 3 years old to 18, by night. Originally from outside of Michoacan in Mexico, she's labored in the fields for 27 years, more than half her life.\n\nThe asthmatic has to visit a doctor often, at least every two months, to order medications and get checkups. She used to go to a clinic in Mecca but switched to another one in Oasis after the closer one was unable to diagnose severe allergies she was struggling with in the fields.\n\nFor seven long years, she said, doctors would tell her to eat chicken soup or sleep for three days, but her job would not allow her to rest for that long.\n\nThe doctors changed every time she went, she explained, so they didn't know her case well enough to diagnosis her accurately. And there were always long waits to get in.\n\nOver that time, her exhaustion and breathing issues worsened. She snapped at her children often. She could not sleep. The pain was eating away at her.\n\n\"There was an intense anger inside of me,\" Ceja said in Spanish. \"I walked around with that. Years and years passed.\n\n\"I felt desperate,\" she said.\n\nWhen she switched to the Oasis clinic, things got better since the medical staff was more consistent, she said.\n\nBut access to sufficient care is still difficult.\n\nShe's waited five hours in the past to get into the emergency room. On at least three different occasions, she's skipped doctors' appointments altogether because she didn't have the time to wait.\n\nSpecialists are even harder. Her husband, whose foot has been crooked since a bout with polio as a young boy, tried to get in to see a doctor to finally take care of the problem. Sent to La Quinta, he missed the first appointment and tried to reschedule, only to be told he had a four-month wait. It would have been longer if someone had not canceled their appointment.\n\nHer neighbor Rosales, 39, does not visit the doctor as often \u2014 just for exams, vaccines or colds. Sometimes she skips clinics because over-the-counter prescriptions are quicker.\n\nIt used to take all day to see a doctor. Now it's quicker, but patients like her still have to either deal with a wait or leave. Some choose to go to border town Mexicali in Mexico.\n\nShe doesn't know what's spurring on the physician shortage, maybe the economic downturn because there isn't enough money in the east valley for young potential future doctors. But she knows that many farmworkers struggle with allergies and illnesses from their work picking fruits and vegetables in the dusty desert.\n\nShe believes the community should unite and ask for the means to correct the area's shortage, maybe through campaigns and workshops.\n\n\"It's necessary and urgent there be more doctors in this area,\" she said. \"(Low-income farmworkers) are the most forgotten when it comes to services.\n\n\"If we don't talk about what's happening, no one's going to help us alone,\" Rosales said. \"Not for us, but for our kids who are born here.\"\n\nDr. Randolph Gibbs has practiced in medically underserved areas for his entire career, 32 years. He's been a family medicine doctor at Clinicas de Salud del Pueblo in the east valley for five of them.\n\n\"This community's kind of special,\" Gibbs said from his office in Mecca. \"The people here are really appreciative.\"\n\nThe clinic provides fast, quality care on the same level as any other throughout the valley.\n\nBut the physician shortage remains, and Gibbs says they are on the front lines.\n\n\"We need primary care for sure,\" he said.\n\nThey are looking for one more doctor and using mid-level staff such as nurse practitioners, as well as medical students for clinical preceptorships in the summer, to fill the gaps.\n\nThe shortages place heavy stress and backlogs on existing doctors in the valley, often forcing them to do urgent-care work, rather than primary care.\n\n\"It makes us work more efficiently, to do a better job seeing more patients,\" Barbour said. \"It makes us want to go out and recruit more doctors.\"\n\nGibbs said the waits aren't long, but he's concerned about getting diagnostic procedures done quickly.\n\n\"We're doing the best we possibly can,\" he said.\n\nBut some specialists such as gastroenterologists still take several weeks to get in to see for the exams.\n\nContinuity of care can also pose challenges for area residents, Gibbs said, as many are uninsured and others migrate north toward Bakersfield or Fresno for seasonal work depending on crops.\n\nHe's optimistic about the problem, especially if incentives can be offered to get family doctors to the desert, saying that a stability of providers would allow people to identify with a physician on a long-term basis as \"their doctor.\"\n\nSeeking out physicians\n\nJFK took a hit in a recent hospital safety score from the nonprofit Leapfrog Group for ICU physician staffing, receiving a worst-performing score, and falling below average on nursing workforce as well.\n\nBut it has also been spearheading progress on improving the east valley doctor shortage.\n\nThe hospital committed this year to offering recruitment packages of $500,000 to $1 million per doctor, as part of a broader pledge to the Clinton Health Matters Initiative to bring physicians to the underserved valley.\n\nThe packages are intended to be both an incentive and a buffer to allow new valley doctors time to familiarize with the community, build a patient base and form insurance contracts before having to pay their own bills.\n\nOne new primary-care physician started in January at the La Quinta Medical Center, through JFK's partnership with Desert Regional. The hospital will also gain a new urologist, a needed specialty, in Coachella starting in January 2015, said Linda Bender, director of business development for JFK.\n\nJFK also has sent letters of intent to a pediatrician and family-practice physician who could potentially join the hospital starting this summer in Indio. They are currently finishing medical residencies, and JFK is waiting on a response.\n\n\"We believe we're making a difference and still have work to be done and are committed to ensuring the community has the physicians and specialists they need so everybody has access,\" Bender said.\n\n\"I think it will continue to improve, especially with the focus of not only the health plans and the hospitals and some of the independent clinics,\" she said.\n\nValley health organizations have been placing their hopes on a series of pipeline and residency programs that would train doctors in the desert. Studies have shown doctors will often practice in their hometowns, as well as the last place they finished medical training.\n\nIn the meantime, the programs also bring teacher and trainee medical professionals here.\n\nEisenhower Medical Center in Rancho Mirage opened a new medical residency last June, bringing 23 residents to the valley. They are expected to see about 12,000 patients each year, and many have volunteered at free clinics. Another 22 medical school graduates were matched to the residency program this year to begin in June.\n\nThe new UC Riverside School of Medicine has also received accreditation for its first residency program that will bring eight residents to the Coachella Valley by July 2015.\n\nIn partnership with Desert Regional Medical Center in Palm Springs, residents will train at the hospital and the UCR Health Family Medicine Center.\n\nSome also wonder whether the creation of a health care district in the east valley could improve the situation there, an idea tossed around for years that has gained traction again as a targeted goal in the Health Matters Blueprint for Action.\n\nCommunity health clinics have started to fill the gaps. This year's free Goldenvoice care focused on finding medical homes for patients, getting them in follow-up care at federally qualified health centers that have become deeply embedded in their communities.\n\nA 6,133-square-foot Volunteers in Medicine clinic, double the size of its last location, opened in February 2013 offering free medical and dental care to low-income residents in the east valley who do not qualify for any other health care. About 23 doctors, seven dentists and five nurse practitioners rotate volunteer care at the Indio clinic.\n\nBut this does not offer a solution for those newly insured under the Affordable Care Act that expanded Medi-Cal to those living below 132 percent of the federal poverty level and offered a health exchange to all with subsidies for those under 400 percent.\n\nPart of the problem in past years has been a lack of health insurance among the low-income that leaves residents without access to health care.\n\nBut \u2014 through partnerships and campaigns from Tenet hospitals, the California Endowment and healthcare district \u2014 thousands in the Coachella Valley enrolled. Medi-Cal enrollment will continue year-round, and efforts are already under way to increase numbers during the next open enrollment period.\n\nClinics throughout the valley have already been seeing people with health insurance through the ACA, and JFK has seen fewer uninsured come through the doors of its emergency room.\n\nThis could theoretically move more people into preventive care and place a heavier burden on doctors in a shortage area like the desert region.\n\n\"The reality is people will get care in whatever form,\" Bender added.\n\nBut they will continue to recruit and add staff, she said.\n\nGibbs said Clinicas was expecting more volume than it has actually seen, although some new patients are trickling in.\n\nThe situation could get worse going forward, too, he said. They have been working with other doctors and health professionals on the team throughout the clinic network to refer the cases.\n\n\"One thing we don't want are delayed treatments, delayed diagnostic procedures; we have to avoid that at all costs,\" he said.\n\nReach healthcare reporter Victoria Pelham at (760) 778-4649, Victoria.Pelham@desertsun.com and on Twitter @vpelham\n\nAbout this report:\n\nSUNDAY: Desert Hot Springs has made progress in adding doctors while the east valley has improved, but still has a large gap to fill.\n\nMONDAY: Desert Regional Medical Center and JFK Memorial Hospital are employing a new tactic to recruit doctors to the region.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://mydesert.co/1n9B96J", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "The clinic is the latest in a series of changes in Desert Hot Springs health care as the area that just a few years ago had a ratio of one doctor per 9,440 residents has moved to one per 4,000.
