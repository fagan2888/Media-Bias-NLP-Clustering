They used to be the best in the world, they say, but no longer. They used to have real standards, but no longer. They used to have discipline, but no longer. What the critics seldom acknowledge is that our schools have changed as our society has changed. Some who look longingly to a golden age in the past remember a time when the schools educated only a small fraction of the population.\n\nBut the students in the college-bound track of fifty years ago did not get the high quality of education that is now typical in public schools with Advanced Placement courses or International Baccalaureate programs or even in the regular courses offered in our top city and suburban schools. There are more remedial classes today, but there are also more public school students with special needs, more students who don\u2019t read English, more students from troubled families, and fewer students dropping out. As for discipline, it bears remembering a 1955 film called \u201cBlackboard Jungle,\u201d about an unruly, violent inner-city school where students bullied other students. The students in this school were all white. Today, public schools are often the safest places for children in tough neighborhoods.\n\nThe claim that the public schools are in decline is not new. In his Pulitzer Prize-winning book \u201cAnti-intellectualism in American Life,\u201d Richard Hofstadter characterized writing on education in the United States as \u201ca literature of acid criticism and bitter complaint . . . The educational jeremiad is as much a feature of our literature as the jeremiad in the Puritan sermons.\u201d From the 1820s to our own time, reformers have complained about low standards, ignorant teachers, and incompetent school boards. He noted that anyone longing for the \u201cgood old days\u201d would have difficulty finding a time when critics were not bemoaning the quality of the public schools.\n\nThere is a tendency nowadays to hark back with nostalgia to the mythical good old days, usually imagined as about forty or fifty years ago. But few people seem to realize there never was a time when everyone succeeded in school. When present-day critics refer to what they assume was a better past, they look back to a time when a large proportion of American youths did not complete high school and only a small minority completed four years of college. In those supposedly halcyon days, the schools in many states were racially segregated, as were most colleges and universities. Children with disabilities did not have a right to a free public education until after the passage of federal legislation in 1975 and were often excluded from public schools. Nor did schools enroll significant numbers of non-English-speaking students in the 1940s and 1950s or even the 1960s. Immigration laws restricted the admission of foreigners to the United States from the early 1920s until the mid-1960s. After the laws were changed, the schools began to enroll students from Latin America, Asia, the Middle East, Russia, Africa, and other parts of the world that had previously arrived in small numbers.\n\nThus, those who now sharply criticize the public schools speak fondly of an era when most schools were racially segregated; when public schools were not required to accept children with physical, mental, and emotional handicaps; when there were relatively few students who did not speak or read English; and when few graduated from high school and went to college.\n\nIndifferent to history, today\u2019s corporate reformers insist that the public schools are in an unprecedented crisis. They tell us that children must be able to \u201cescape\u201d their \u201cfailing public schools.\u201d They claim they are \u201cfor the children,\u201d unlike their teachers, who are not for the children. They would have the public believe that children and their teachers are in warring camps. They put \u201cchildren first\u201d or \u201cstudents first.\u201d Their policies, they say, will make us competitive and give us \u201cgreat teachers\u201d and \u201cgreat schools\u201d in every community. They say they know how to \u201cclose the achievement gap,\u201d and they claim to be leading \u201cthe civil rights issue of our time.\u201d Their policies, they say, will make our children into \u201cglobal competitors.\u201d They will protect our national security. They will make America strong again. The corporate reformers play to our anxieties, even rekindling dormant Cold War fears that we may be in jeopardy as a nation if we don\u2019t buy what they are selling.\n\nThe critics want the public to believe that our public schools are a clear and present danger to our society. Unless there is radical change, they say, our society will fall apart. Our economy will disappear. Our national security is in danger. The message is clear: public education threatens all that we hold dear.\n\nRecognizing that most Americans have a strong attachment to their community schools, the corporate reformers have taken care to describe their aims in pseudo-populist terms. While trying to scare us with warnings of dire peril, they mask their agenda with rhetoric that is soothing and deceptive. Though they speak of \u201creform,\u201d what they really mean is deregulation and privatization. When they speak of \u201caccountability,\u201d what they really mean is a rigid reliance on standardized testing as both the means and the end of education. When they speak of \u201ceffective teachers,\u201d what they mean is teachers whose students produce higher scores on standardized tests every year, not teachers who inspire their students to love learning. When they speak of \u201cinnovation,\u201d they mean replacing teachers with technology to cut staffing costs. When they speak of \u201cno excuses,\u201d they mean a boot-camp culture where students must obey orders and rules without question.\n\nWhen they speak of \u201cpersonalized instruction,\u201d they mean putting children in front of computers with algorithms that supposedly adjust content and test questions to the ability level of the student but actually sacrifice human contact with a real teacher. When they speak of \u201cachievement\u201d or \u201cperformance,\u201d they mean higher scores on standardized tests. When they speak of \u201cdata-driven instruction,\u201d they mean that test scores and graduation rates should be the primary determinant of what is best for children and schools. When they speak of \u201ccompetition,\u201d they mean deregulated charters and deregulated private schools competing with highly regulated public schools. When they speak of \u201ca successful school,\u201d they refer only to its test scores, not to a school that is the center of its community, with a great orchestra, an enthusiastic chorus, a hardworking chess team, a thriving robotics program, or teachers who have dedicated their lives to helping the students with the highest needs (and often the lowest scores).\n\nThe reformers define the purpose of education as preparation for global competitiveness, higher education, or the workforce. They view students as \u201chuman capital\u201d or \u201cassets.\u201d One seldom sees any reference in their literature or public declarations to the importance of developing full persons to assume the responsibilities of citizenship.\n\nOf equal importance are the topics that corporate reformers don\u2019t talk about. Seldom do they protest budget cuts, no matter how massive they may be. They do not complain when governors and legislatures cut billions from the public schools while claiming to be reformers. They do not protest rising rates of child poverty. They do not complain about racial segregation. They see no harm in devoting more time and resources to standardized testing. They are not heard from when districts cut the arts, libraries, and physical education while spending more on testing. They do not complain when federal or state or city officials announce plans to test children in kindergarten or even pre-kindergarten.\n\nThey do not complain about increased class size. They do not object to scripted curricula or teachers\u2019 loss of professional autonomy.\n\nThey do not object when experienced teachers are replaced by recruits who have only a few weeks of training. They close their eyes to evidence that charters enroll disproportionately small numbers of children with disabilities, or those from troubled homes, or English-language learners (in fact, they typically deny any such disparities, even when documented by state and federal data). They do not complain when for-profit corporations run charter schools or when educational services are outsourced to for-profit businesses. Indeed, they welcome entrepreneurs into the reform community as investors and partners.\n\nIf the American public understood that reformers want to privatize their public schools and divert their taxes to pay profits to investors, it would be hard to sell the corporate idea of reform. If parents understood that the reformers want to close down their community schools and require them to go shopping for schools, some far from home, that may or may not accept their children, it would be hard to sell the corporate idea of reform. If the American public understood that the very concept of education was being disfigured into a mechanism to apply standardized testing and sort their children into data points on a normal curve, it would be hard to sell the corporate idea of reform.\n\nIf the American public understood that their children\u2019s teachers will be judged by the same test scores that label their children as worthy or unworthy, it would be hard to sell the corporate idea of reform. If the American public knew how inaccurate and unreliable these methods are, both for children and for teachers, it would be hard to sell the corporate idea of reform. And that is why the reform message must be rebranded to make it palatable to the public.\n\nThe leaders of the privatization movement call themselves reformers, but their premises are strikingly different from those of reformers in the past. In earlier eras, reformers wanted such things as a better curriculum, better-prepared teachers, better funding, more equitable funding, smaller classes, and desegregation, which they believed would lead to better public schools. By contrast, today\u2019s reformers insist that public education is a failed enterprise and that all these strategies have been tried and failed.\n\nThey assert that the best way to save education is to hand it over to private management and let the market sort out the winners and the losers. They wish to substitute private choices for the public\u2019s responsibility to provide good schools for all children. They lack any understanding of the crucial role of public schools in a democracy.\n\nThe central premise of this movement is that our public schools are in decline. But this is not true. The public schools are working very well for most students. Contrary to popular myth, the scores on the no-stakes federal tests\u2014 the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) \u2014 are at an all-time high for students who are white, black, Hispanic, and Asian. Graduation rates are also at an all-time high.\n\nMore young people than ever are entering college. Even more would go to college if the costs were not so high.\n\nOf course some schools and districts have very low test scores and low graduation rates, and this has always been true. Most of these schools and districts have two features in common: poverty and high concentrations of racial minorities. The combination of these two factors is associated with low test scores. Children whose parents are poor and have low educational attainment tend to have lower test scores.\n\nChildren who are poor receive less medical attention and less nutrition and experience more stress, disruption, and crises in their lives. These factors have an ongoing and profound effect on academic performance.\n\nThat is why poor children need even more stability, more support, smaller class sizes, and more attention from their teachers and others in their schools, but often receive far less, due to underfunding.\n\nUnfortunately, many people are unwilling to address the root causes of poor school outcomes, because doing so is either too politically difficult or too costly.\n\nThey believe it is faster, simpler, and less expensive to privatize the public schools than do anything substantive to reduce poverty and racial isolation or to provide the nurturing environments and well-rounded education that children from prosperous families receive.\n\nInstead, the privatization movement nonchalantly closes the schools attended by poor children and destabilizes their lives. The privatization agenda excites the interest of edu-entrepreneurs, who see it as a golden opportunity to make money. But it is bad for our society. It undermines the sense of collective responsibility for collective needs. It hurts public education not only by attacking its effectiveness and legitimacy but by laying claim to its revenues. The money allocated to privately managed charters and vouchers represents a transfer of critical public resources to the private sector, causing the public schools to suffer budget cuts and loss of staffing and services as the private sector grows, without providing better education or better outcomes for the students who transfer to the private-sector schools.\n\nReformers in every era have used the schools as punching bags. In one era, progressives complained that the schools were obsolete, backward, mindless, rigid, and out of step with the demands of the modern age. Then, in their turn, came anti-progressives or \u201cessentialists\u201d who complained that the schools had grown soft, standards and curriculum had collapsed, and students were not learning as much as they once did.\n\nAt the beginning of the twentieth century, reformers lambasted the schools, saying they were too academic and ignored the economy\u2019s need for trained workers. In 1914, Congress passed the first federal legislation to encourage industrial and vocational education so that schools could prepare young people for jobs on the nation\u2019s farms and factories. In the 1930s, with millions of people out of work, reformers blamed the schools for their inability to keep students enrolled and out of the ranks of the unemployed. Reformers called on the schools to be more attentive to the needs of adolescents so as to entice them to stay in school longer. The New Deal created the Civilian Conservation Corps and the National Youth Administration to provide education and training for young people during the Depression.\n\nIn the 1940s, reformers complained that the schools were obsolete and were failing to give students the skills they needed for life and work; \u201clife adjustment education\u201d became the reformers\u2019 battle cry. In the 1950s, reformers said that the schools had forgotten the basics and needed to raise academic standards and return to time-honored subject matter disciplines. In the 1960s, reformers said that the schools were too academic and that students were stifled by routine and dreary assignments; the reformers wanted more spontaneity, more freedom, and fewer requirements for students. At the same time, the civil rights movement achieved major gains, and the schools became the focus of national legislation and Supreme Court rulings that required desegregation.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Our public schools aren't in decline.
