(Photo: Jett Loe / Sun-News)\n\nMore than 52,300 New Mexicans selected plans for 2015 through the marketplace (a 63 percent increase from the prior year), and as of February this year, more than 5,600 people from Do\u00f1a Ana County had selected plans, according to information provided by NMHIX.\n\nWhile New Mexicans currently enrolled in Blue Cross and Blue Shield of New Mexico plans will see no change in their coverage for 2015, they will need to select a new plan with a new carrier during the upcoming enrollment period for 2016 coverage. Certain individuals may also need to alter their plans, depending on changes in health status, family makeup or financial situations.\n\n\"We estimate that about half of people who are currently enrolled will have to go in and make a change,\" Dowd said.\n\nThose who don't need to take action, because their plan will not be discontinued or because they are happy with their coverage, are encouraged to visit the beWellnm website and shop the marketplace, Dowd said.\n\n\"It's good to come in during the open enrollment period, shop, update your financial information,\" she said. \"You may be eligible for additional premium assistance, or you may find that you need a different plan.\"\n\nIndividuals may find that they are eligible for a tax credit, which can reduce the monthly cost of their insurance plan.\n\nBuy Photo Representatives from the four insurance companies participating in the Affordable Care Act exchange in New Mexico listen to recent presentations about the exchange at Do\u00f1a Ana Community College.

You can get as much as 85 percent credit in the exchange if you're just above the poverty level, which means that a $400 dollar policy will only cost you $50 dollars a month.\"\n\nHealth insurance plans range from catastrophic, in which members generally pay all of their medical costs up to a certain amount, to platinum plans, which have higher monthly payments and lower out-of-pocket costs when visiting the doctor. However, most plans are offered at the bronze, silver or gold level, Dowd said.\n\nDon't wait too long\n\n\"Nationally, in New Mexico, our health insurance rates continue to be very low, so there's plenty of choices,\" Dowd said. \"There's lots of market competition helping to keep the prices low and our uninsured rate is dropping, so we're hoping to keep up the really good momentum this coming year.\"\n\nDowd said one of the common mistakes people make when getting enrolled is that they wait too long to make a decision.\n\n\"Health insurance isn't like going online and buying (plane) tickets,\" she said. \"It's a little bit more involved. We find it takes people sometimes two or three visits to the website to shop, to talk to their significant other or their family and to understand if it's the best plan for them for next year.\"\n\nWhile open enrollment ends Jan. 31, consumers who need health coverage effective Jan.1 will have to select a plan no later than Dec. 15, Dowd said.\n\n\"If you miss that deadline, you face having a gap in coverage and, of course, that's bad because you never know what's going to happen,\" she said.\n\nPenalty increases\n\nThose who miss the the final enrollment deadline will not be able to get health insurance for 2016 unless they qualify for special enrollment. Families and individuals who don't have coverage in 2016 will face penalties when they file their federal income tax return.\n\n\"The penalty increases this year,\" Dowd said. \"What we always tell people is go out and see what you can find for coverage, because it may be less overall for you to have insurance than to pay the financial penalty, and that becomes ever more real each year.\"\n\nThe fee for not having coverage in 2016 is 2.5 percent of household income or $695 per person ($347.50 per child under 18) for the year \u2014 whichever is higher, according to HealthCare.gov.\n\n\"We don't want people to wait until the last minute,\" Dowd said. \"Start the process early. You can go on (the website) and you can shop, and you can go all the way up until the end of the process, where you hit you want to apply. The information is saved. You can log back in again, re-shop if you want.\"\n\nThis year, several informational events and kiosks are scheduled to take place at various locations throughout the state to help people get insured during open enrollment, Dowd said.\n\nA beWellnm information table will be set up at the Farmers & Crafts Market on Saturday.\n\nFor a calendar of events and more information about the New Mexico's Health Insurance Exchange, visit nmhix.com.
