Rush Holt, D-N.J., would like Congress to make it official. He recently re-introduced a resolution in the House to deem Feb. 12, Darwin Day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s already a thing, but whether it will be blessed by Congress depends on how highly evolved the members of Congress are,\u201d Holt told Whispers. (We see what you did there, congressman.) It\u2019s true that groups across the country and the world already celebrate Darwin, considered the father of evolutionary theory, on that day.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe official Darwin Day, if Holt gets his way, wouldn't be a federal holiday or anything like that. \u201cThis would not be a shopping day where...offices are closed and businesses are open,\u201d Holt told Whispers. (Besides, Presidents\u2019 Day already reserves a Monday in February off for the American public.) \u201cMaybe it\u2019s a day where we should, instead of taking the day off, it\u2019s a day where we should think extra hard,\u201d Holt said laughing.\n\n\n\n\n\n[READ: Biden's Amtrak Tweets at Everyone, Not Just Joe] The purpose of Darwin Day is to recognize the \u201cimportance of science in the betterment of humanity\u201d according to the bill, which is backed by the American Humanist Association.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe basic point is Darwin is an admirable model for us to look to,\u201d Holt said. \u201cSomeone who...could teach us all a thing or two about how to think.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThat sounds innocent enough, but doesn't mean the resolution isn't politically tinged. The bill asks that \u201cthe advancement of science must be protected from those unconcerned with the adverse impacts of global warming and climate change.\u201d Additionally, it says the \u201cteaching of creationism in some public schools compromises the scientific and academic integrity of the United States education systems.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bill already received the headline \u201cResolution Recognizing \u2018Darwin Day,\u2019 Slamming Creationism, Introduced to Congress,\u201d in the Christian Post, potentially making it a difficult horse for Republicans to get behind. [ALSO: Nancy Pelosi's Stand-up: A Final Bow?]\n\n\n\n\n\nThat being said, Holt says he\u2019s hopeful it will get through the GOP-led House. \u201cOh, I\u2019m always optimistic,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery once in awhile Congress leads and shows that we\u2019re far thinking and broad-minded, so even though this hasn't reached a crescendo as a great national movement, I think there would be a lot of support out there, a lot of approval if Congress did this.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bill has been referred to the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology. The committee is chaired by Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, who in past interviews has voiced skepticism of climate change, making it unlikely the resolution would make it to the House floor before Darwin\u2019s big day this year.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith or without Congress, Holt plans to celebrate. \u201dYou know what I might do is re-read the closing chapter of the \u2018Beak of the Finch,\u2019 which is just a wonderfully interesting book,\u201d Holt said. \u201cWritten by some people in my congressional district,\u201d he added.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Washington Whispers [News]", "title": "Rep.
