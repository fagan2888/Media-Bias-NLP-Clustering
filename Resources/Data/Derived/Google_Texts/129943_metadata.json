(Photo: Courier-Journal File Photos )\n\nThe Americana Community Center World Festival started out as a block party held in various places \u2014 the center itself, a soccer field, a ValuMarket parking lot.\n\nBut as Louisville\u2019s international population expanded, so did the annual event, which made its debut in 1990.\n\nBack then, the city\u2019s immigrant population was no more than 15,000, said Americana executive director Edgardo Mansilla. Now, nearly 40,000 Jefferson County residents were born in a different country, according to the most recent U.S. Census data.\n\nThis year\u2019s festival, which will take place Saturday at Iroquois Amphitheater, will be a celebration of Louisville\u2019s diversity, Mansilla said. There will be performances of all sorts \u2014 Nepali dancers, African drummers, Appalachian folk musicians and more \u2014 as well as foods and crafts from all over the world.\n\n\u201cWe have a little bit of everything, and we tried to get as much of everything as we possibly could ... so that all the cultures would be celebrated,\u201d said Heather Bruner, Americana\u2019s grants and development manager and one of the festival\u2019s organizers.\n\nBassist Steve Loomis\u2019 Afrobeat group, The Afrophysicists, has been a staple of the Americana World Festival for years, and he said the band\u2019s music \u2014 which has Nigerian roots and is like funk and soul infused with African percussion \u2014 is a \u201cperfect fit\u201d for the festival.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re trying to showcase all the different styles of music from different cultures that we\u2019ve got right here in the city,\u201d Loomis said. \u201cWe\u2019re a good example of that, but they get lots of similar things ... it\u2019s different stuff than you would hear around town generally.\u201d\n\nThe free event will also have a kids\u2019 zone with face-painting, crafts and games until 7 p.m.\n\nThe city\u2019s growing international population, Bruner said, can largely be attributed to its several well-established refugee services based in Louisville, which the United Nations has classified as a preferred site for refugee relocation.\n\nBut immigrants are also attracted to the city\u2019s sense of security and relatively low cost of living, Mansilla said.\n\nAmericana provides services like coaching and English classes for immigrants to bridge the gap between \u201cthe culture of their native countries and American culture,\u201d Bruner said. The nonprofit agency works closely with refugee assistance programs, such as Kentucky Refugee Ministries and Catholic Charities.\n\nAmericana assists immigrants from 98 countries who live across 37 local ZIP codes, Mansilla said. He hopes the festival will be a way to represent \u201cthe diversity that exists in Louisville today,\u201d and not just the Beechmont neighborhood surrounding the Americana Community Center, where many immigrants choose to live.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the realities of Lousville,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are international and are spread out all over the city.\u201d\n\nReporter Kirsten Clark can be reached at (502) 582-4144 or on Twitter by following @kirstenlmclark.\n\nAmericana Community Center World Festival\n\nWhat: A festival with foods, crafts and performances from all over the world\n\nWhen: 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. Saturday\n\nWhere: Iroquois Amphitheater, 1080 Amphitheater Road\n\nCost: The event is free and open to the public.\n\nMore information: Go to americanacc.org or call 366-7813.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cjky.it/1mGBjCg", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "The 25th annual Americana Community Center World Festival, a party with foods, crafts and performances from all over the world, will be held from 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. Saturday at the Iroquois Amphitheater.", "og": {"site_name": "The Courier-Journal", "description": "The 25th annual Americana Community Center World Festival, a party with foods, crafts and performances from all over the world, will be held from 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. Saturday at the Iroquois Amphitheater.", "title": "World Festival highlights city\u2019s international population", "url": "http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/local/south/2014/06/01/world-festival-highlights-citys-international-population/9841669/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/courier-journal.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The 25th annual Americana Community Center World Festival, a party with foods, crafts and performances from all over the world, will be held from 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. Saturday at the Iroquois Amphitheater.", "title": "World Festival highlights city\u2019s international population", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e5608dad0a9e5448d4da5b728d5fdfcfb7f30da6/c=496-0-2504-2008&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/06/01/americana2.jpg", "creator": "@courierjournal", "site": "@courierjournal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600030236", "fb": {"app_id": 128534137209813}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"category": "news/local/south", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6890416c8ebe0c40104ad2e94ae2e41916fcac65/c=747-0-2253-2008/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/06/01/americana2.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b636e48a4f6f2856c70eff5b872f862677207df4/c=496-0-2504-2008/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/06/01/americana2.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f45398c461584acc6c64a72534565bd1c9b47dcf/c=162-0-2839-2008/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/06/01/americana2.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e428ced83a7d4a88e6977370a56e7e42296df57d/c=0-160-3000-1848&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/06/01/americana2.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-06-01T15:47:59-04:00", "shorthed": "World Festival highlights city\u2019s international population", "articleid": 9841669, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/fac3dff09d224b4e4f42c43aa38f4d985bf5d6b3/c=0-160-3000-1848/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/06/01/americana2.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/eb0cd2efee6c7237de34dedf85356342180630a8/c=935-0-2065-2008/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/06/01/americana2.jpg"}, "gci-asset-type": "story", "title": "World Festival highlights city\u2019s international population", "pageclass": "article", "author": "Kirsten Clark"}, "news_keywords": ""}, "article_summary": "(Photo: Courier-Journal File Photos )The Americana Community Center World Festival started out as a block party held in various places \u2014 the center itself, a soccer field, a ValuMarket parking lot.\nDancers, from left, Sarita Tamang, 18, Laxmi Bastola, 18, Mamta Subba, 18, and Pujan Gurung, 17, perform a traditional Nepalese dance during last year\u2019s Americana World Festival at Iroquois Amphitheater.\nBack then, the city\u2019s immigrant population was no more than 15,000, said Americana executive director Edgardo Mansilla.\nBassist Steve Loomis\u2019 Afrobeat group, The Afrophysicists, has been a staple of the Americana World Festival for years, and he said the band\u2019s music \u2014 which has Nigerian roots and is like funk and soul infused with African percussion \u2014 is a \u201cperfect fit\u201d for the festival.\nBut as Louisville\u2019s international population expanded, so did the annual event, which made its debut in 1990."}
