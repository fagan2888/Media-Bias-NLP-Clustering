Converse’s iconic sneaker, the Chuck Taylor All Star, is getting an upgrade. The new sneaker, dubbed Chuck II, features better shock absorption, a padded non-slip tongue, micro-suede lining, and a sturdier canvas made of Tencel, a high-tech fabric made from wood pulp.

The Converse Rubber Shoe Company made the first All Stars in 1917. The simple cotton and rubber sneakers were originally aimed at serious athletes playing soccer and netball, an early version of basketball. By the 1960s, about 90 percent of college and professional basketball players wore All Stars, and the sneakers accounted for 80 percent of the consumer sneaker market.

For decades, the sneakers were a counterculture fashion statement, popular with musicians, artists, and writers. Rockers like the Ramones and Kurt Cobain wore them, along with writers like Hunter S. Thompson. The brand was adopted by skateboarders in the’ 70s, adding to its street cred. The Rolling Stones made Chuck Taylors the official sneaker of their Steel Wheels Tour in 1989.

Converse has sold more than a billion pairs of Chucks. The company has gone bankrupt a few times, before being bought by Nike in 2003 for $305 million. Annual sales of the brand have increased 75 percent in the last five years to nearly $2 billion—just a fraction of Nike’s total annual revenue of $30 billion, but still a nice chunk of change. Sales have grown an average of 15 percent in the past three years.

The new Chucks will cost about $75 – $15 more than the old model -- and will be available in both high-top and low-top models in four colors: black, red, white and blue. They go on sale on July 28th. Here are some interesting facts about the iconic piece of footwear:
