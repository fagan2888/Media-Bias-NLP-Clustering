What made the massive haul stand out most of all was that the bundles were wrapped and stamped with \u201cObamacare\u201d labels.\n\nA Massachusetts state trooper pulled over a car early last Friday after noticing the vehicle had several violations. After an investigation during the traffic stop, police uncovered 1,250 bags of the drugs with the \u201cObamacare\u201d stamp as reported on the Massachusetts State Police Facebook page.\n\nThe car\u2019s driver Tyler Robenstein, 23, of Colchester, Vt., was nabbed on a variety of charges including trafficking in heroin, conspiracy to violate the drugs laws, possession to distribute a Class A substance, speeding, unlicensed operation of a motor vehicle and failure to change lanes for an emergency vehicle.\n\nPassengers Marquese Jones, 22, and Sherod Green, 24, both of Newark, N.J., and Ashley Beaulieu, 21, of Colchester, Vt. were all charged with trafficking in heroin, conspiracy to violate the drugs laws and possession to distribute a Class A substance.\n\nDrugs bearing odd nicknames isn\u2019t a new trend, as dealers use the tags to mark where the product hails from and its supposed quality. There\u2019s also a heroin brand nicknamed after late Nirvana singer, Kurt Cobain.\n\nThe four men are currently being held and are awaiting a future court date to face sentencing.\n\nHit the following pages to see the \u201cObamacare\u201d heroin haul.\n\n[NBC Connecticut]\n\n\u2014\n\nPhotos: Massachusetts State Police\n\nComments: 0 Tags: heroin, massachusetts\n\nEmail This\n\nLeave a Comment", "article_metadata": {"description": "Cops in Massachusetts make massive Heroin bust last Friday (December).
