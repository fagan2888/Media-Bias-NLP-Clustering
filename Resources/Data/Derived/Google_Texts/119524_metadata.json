Republican Speaker of the House John Boehner argued it was best to capitulate on these issues and focus on Obamacare, which the party views as a winning issue going into November elections.\n\nLevin thinks a little differently. \u201cI am sick and tired of defeatist Republicans going on and on, \u2018You gotta count the numbers,'\u201d he said. \u201cLeaders affect events. Leaders change mindsets. Leaders change trajectory.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhom among Republican leaders is explaining, day in and day out, the coming, the looming catastrophe?\u201d he continued. \u201cYou need to communicate this in real, human terms to the people.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe American people need to be told if this continues for as many more years, they\u2019re going to use their pensions, they\u2019re going to use their savings, their going to use their college funds, and the value of the currency is going to crash,\u201d he later added. \u201cThis is a fact.\u201d\n\nCavuto agreed. \u201cYeah, but John Boehner has more or less told the tea partiers, more or less told the conservatives, more or less told the Mark Levins, \u2018Look, why don\u2019t you guys just sit on it because we are winning with this strategy, we are getting our way with this strategy.'\u201d\n\n\u201cThe country\u2019s bigger than John Boehner, or Mitch McConnell for that matter, or any single man or even political group,\u201d Levin responded. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about, here, preserving the republic. Economies do crash. Societies do crash.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t just fight a battle three weeks before the battle\u2019s coming,\u201d he later said angrily, referencing the recent debt ceiling deadline. \u201cYou need to have a strategy. Example: the next debt ceiling is March 2015. Start today. Make the case. Explain it to the American people. Rather than go on Jay Leno\u2019s show, slouch in the chair and act like an ass.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen leaders, I\u2019ve worked for leaders,\u201d Levin ranted. \u201cAnd leaders change events, leaders affect the future, they have arguments. They don\u2019t stand their with marbles in their mouth, trash their own party and so forth.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook, it\u2019s a party right now \u2014 we need a new Republican party. We need new leaders,\u201d he contended. \u201cI\u2019ve seen it with Reagan, I\u2019ve seen it with Gingrich, say what you will. There are men, there are women out there waiting in the wings, who can lead this party and make a case.\u201d\n\nFollow Brendan on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
