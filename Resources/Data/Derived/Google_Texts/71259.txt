Philadelphia police have arrested two teenagers in a string of armed robberies that took place near Temple University's campus last month and mostly targeted students, said Capt. Frank Banford of Central Detectives.

The teenagers, ages 17 and 16, were taken into custody Thursday. Banford said Detectives Ralph Domenic and James Waring used videotape footage of the suspects and tips from the public to track the two to their high school and from there learned their identities.

The teens face charges in a spree of six stickups, all of which took place in the span of a week - including several on the same days, Banford said.
