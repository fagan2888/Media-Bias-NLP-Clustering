Most of the conferences took place in China, and most of the fake papers have authors with Chinese affiliations. Labb\u00e9 has emailed editors and authors named in many of the papers and related conferences but received scant replies; one editor said that he did not work as a program chair at a particular conference, even though he was named as doing so, and another author claimed his paper was submitted on purpose to test out a conference, but did not respond on follow-up.\n\nRetraction Watch notes that this story undercuts some of the conclusions people have drawn from a feature that Science published last fall. In that report, \ufeffa researcher posing as a scholar at an imaginary African institute managed to publish nonsense papers in 304 open-access journals, a result touted in some quarters as showing a link between the open-access world and crappy quality control. (Open-access publications allow anyone to read their papers online, while conventional academic outlets charge high fees.) But Bohannon didn't submit his faux study to any traditional journals, so his results don't really allow you to compare the old and new models.\n\nAll of the outlets that Labb\u00e9 exposed were subscription-based. The problem is evidently more extensive than some people thought.\n\n[Hat tip: Bryan Alexander.]", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Dozens of secret Sokals.", "title": "Academic Publishers Retract More Than 120 Papers After Learning They Were \"Computer-Generated Nonsense\"", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2014/02/25/academic-publishers-retract-more-than-12", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/mc/jwalker/2014_02/gibberish.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Nature has the \nlede of the week:\nThe publishers Springer and IEEE are removing more than\n120 papers from their subscription services after a French\nresearcher discovered that the works were computer-generated\nnonsense.\nThe researcher is Cyril Labb\u00e9, a computer scientist who \"has\ncatalogued computer-generated papers that made it into more than 30\npublished conference proceedings between 2008 and 2013.\" According\nto Nature, he", "title": "Academic Publishers Retract More Than 120 Papers After Learning They Were \"Computer-Generated Nonsense\"", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/mc/jwalker/2014_02/gibberish.jpg", "creator": "@notjessewalker", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "Science/Tech", "published_time": "2014-02-25T16:39:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/jesse-walker"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "article_summary": "The researcher is Cyril Labb\u00e9, a computer scientist who \"has catalogued computer-generated papers that made it into more than 30 published conference proceedings between 2008 and 2013.\"\nNature has the lede of the week:The publishers Springer and IEEE are removing more than 120 papers from their subscription services after a French researcher discovered that the works were computer-generated nonsense.\nMost of the conferences took place in China, and most of the fake papers have authors with Chinese affiliations.\nAccording to Nature, heLabb\u00e9 does not know why the papers were submitted\u2014or even if the authors were aware of them.\n(Open-access publications allow anyone to read their papers online, while conventional academic outlets charge high fees.)"}
