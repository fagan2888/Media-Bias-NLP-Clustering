You have to learn about agriculture. You have to learn about the chemistry of food. You have to learn to have a budget. You have to learn about food cost, about labor cost. And every day, it\u2019s like, nearly showtime, will all the people show up?\n\nJEFFREY BROWN: Pouillon\u2019s new book, \u201cMy Organic Life,\u201d tells how she got there, growing up on a farm in the Austrian Alps and later Vienna, then moving in the 1960s with her then husband, a Frenchman, to the United States, where she was shocked by the highly processed, hormone-infused food she found.\n\nNORA POUILLON: The produce department was the smallest department. Iceberg lettuce was everywhere, and oranges and apples and pears, and no fresh garlic, no fresh herbs, no bowl of lettuces, nice lettuces.\n\nIn Europe, you go from little place to place, and you go from your butcher to your green grocer to the baker, and you have a \u2014 you have a discussion. The experience of going to a supermarket was different.\n\nJEFFREY BROWN: And also, as you write, Wonder Bread, right, the great staple.\n\nNORA POUILLON: Rows and rows of Wonder Bread, rows and rows. And I remember when Pepperidge Farm came in or \u2014 it was like, wow, this is like a revelation.\n\nJEFFREY BROWN: She started out cooking for friends, then became a cooking instructor, before opening Nora in 1979. It would become a great success, a destination for presidents.\n\nBut, in the beginning, she remembers, healthy food was a tough sell. She first called it additive-free, but a friend convinced her that didn\u2019t sound very tasty.\n\nNORA POUILLON: You have to educate people of \u2014 that it\u2019s important what they put in their bodies, very important, because that\u2019s how they feel and that\u2019s how they behave and that\u2019s how they think.\n\nI mean, in this country, the health problems are enormous.\n\nJEFFREY BROWN: And what about the cost of organic food? From 20 to 47 percent more, depending on the study. Pouillon insists that is the wrong way to look at the economics of food and the value of making organics available to all.\n\nNORA POUILLON: It\u2019s only more expensive because, in this country, the cost of food is not really the true cost, and so much of the food here is subsidized. And all the bad food is subsidized, unfortunately.\n\nSo, I just feel my motto is always, I prefer to spend my money on food and not on the doctor.\n\nJEFFREY BROWN: Much has changed, of course, making organic foods more accessible and affordable. Pouillon helped found Washington, D.C.\u2019s first producers-only farmers market, the kind of market now found in many cities around the country.\n\nShe works with local growers to build a pipeline of seasonal organic food close to her restaurant.\n\nNORA POUILLON: You cannot start out your day with bacon and eggs, and then have for lunch a big hamburger, and then have for dinner pork chops and then apple pie. I mean, that doesn\u2019t work.\n\nJEFFREY BROWN: But that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t enjoy eating.\n\nNORA POUILLON: This restaurant, my point was to show people that, if you have wholesome, nutritious ingredients, then you can cook whatever you want. But you can have all these things, but not on the same day.\n\nAnd if the ingredients themselves are pure and wholesome, then I don\u2019t see any point on keeping a special diet. Your diet is the way you eat, is just to use certified organic ingredients.\n\nJEFFREY BROWN: That certification comes from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n\nNORA POUILLON: It means is that they have no pesticides, no antibiotics, no hormones, no \u2014 I mean, this is all vegetables. It wouldn\u2019t have that.\n\nJEFFREY BROWN: Yes.\n\nNORA POUILLON: They have no fungicides, no \u2014 basically no pesticides.\n\nJEFFREY BROWN: So, cooking organically, having an organic kitchen means having to deal with \u2014 I mean, it makes it harder in some ways. Right?\n\nNORA POUILLON: Yes. First of all, I deal with 35 different farmers, and \u2014 because one of them does for me only the chicken. The other one does only the beef. And the other one does only the pork.\n\nEverybody does something different. Somebody has only the eggs, and the milk, and the yogurt. Suddenly, he doesn\u2019t have enough chickens because it was too cold and the chickens didn\u2019t want to eat. And so the chicken doesn\u2019t weigh 3.5 pounds, weighs only two pounds. So, I\u2026\n\nJEFFREY BROWN: And then for you, it\u2019s uh-oh.\n\nNORA POUILLON: For me, it\u2019s, oh, I have no chickens.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nJEFFREY BROWN: No chickens one day, so more creativity required in the kitchen.\n\nThere seems to be more of that in American kitchens these days. There are now well over 100 certified organic restaurants in the U.S.\n\nReading and hoping to eat, for the PBS NewsHour, I\u2019m Jeffrey Brown in Washington, D.C.", "article_metadata": {"description": "From a farm in the Austrian Alps, to the first certified organic restaurant in the United States, chef and natural food advocate Nora Pouillon tells her life story in a new book, \"My Organic Life.\" Jeffrey Brown offers a taste of Pouillon\u2019s memoir and how she\u2019s helped change food culture in America.", "pubdate": 20150514, "og": {"site_name": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "From a farm in the Austrian Alps, to the first certified organic restaurant in the United States, chef and natural food advocate Nora Pouillon tells her life story in a new book, \"My Organic Life.\" Jeffrey Brown offers a taste of Pouillon\u2019s memoir and how she\u2019s helped change food culture in America.", "title": "Organic food pioneer shares life\u2019s work, from farm to table", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-14-at-7.07.45-PM.png", "url": "http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/organic-food-pioneer-shares-lifes-work-farm-cafe-table/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "From a farm in the Austrian Alps, to the first certified organic restaurant in the United States, chef and natural food advocate Nora Pouillon tells her life story in a new book, \"My Organic Life.\" Jeffrey Brown offers a taste of Pouillon\u2019s memoir and how she\u2019s helped change food culture in America.", "title": "Organic food pioneer shares life\u2019s work, from farm to table", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-14-at-7.07.45-PM.png", "creator": "@newshour", "site": "@newshour", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"app_id": 114150878604116}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newshour", "tag": "organic"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "food, My Organic Life, NewsHour Bookshelf, organic"}, "article_summary": "NORA POUILLON: Rows and rows of Wonder Bread, rows and rows.\nShe works with local growers to build a pipeline of seasonal organic food close to her restaurant.\nYou have to learn about food cost, about labor cost.\nJEFFREY BROWN: And what about the cost of organic food?\nRELATED LINKSJUDY WOODRUFF: A pioneer of the food movement has long been stirring the pot to get quality organic integrated into America\u2019s diet."}
