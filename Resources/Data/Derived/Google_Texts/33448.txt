Last week I wrote a column saying there are nine things we should stop saying or writing. You can click on the link above to see what I think we need to stop saying.

In the column I asked you to offer suggestions about what we should stop saying or writing. And you responded with some suggestions - some of them funny, some of them brutal.

Without any further delay, here are some of the things you suggested we stop saying or writing.

Gov. Bob Riley: "He's now contract lobbyist Bob Riley..." Dan Roberts, Montgomery.

Doctor Robert Bentley: "...A medical doctor's first duty is to do no harm. Bentley has done harm to the poor and old by refusing to take part in the Affordable Care Act which would help so many in our state." Clair Houston, Birmingham.

Journalist Chuck Dean: "You're just a click ho now buddy." Sam Carter, Moundville.

The People's House: "Lawmakers in both the state house and the U.S. House of Representatives like to say they serve in the 'people's house.' The truth is they serve in the house of the bankers, the fat-cat industrialists, the National Rifle Association or the AARP (American Association of Retired Persons), and most especially the lobbyists who buy their votes." Richard Cooper, Mobile.

Chief Justice Roy Moore: "...How about we just drop chief justice and sub chief magistrate of the Court of Oyer and Terminer (Salem witch trials). Gloria Bennett, Atlanta.

The Birmingham News. The Mobile Register. The Huntsville Times. "I think it's self-evident why." Janice Wilson, Birmingham.

Congressman Mo Brooks: "...How about Big Brother Mo? Orwell would understand." Ruth Johnson, Huntsville.

The I-10 Causeway: "I-10 parking lot," Gill Aaron, Fairhope.

Clean Coal: "Just stop it. There is no such thing and every time you write it or say it you look stupid or you tell people you're a tool." Linda Cook, Tuscaloosa.

Thanks for all the suggestions, including you Mr. Carter.

If you guys think of others, you know where to find me.
