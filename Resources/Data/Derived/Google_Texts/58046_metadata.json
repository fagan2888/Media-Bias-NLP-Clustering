Her biological mother considered a \"back alley\" abortion, she said, but backed out because it was illegal at the time.\n\n\"I was protected by Michigan legislators who recognized that mine was a life worth saving,\" said Kiessling. \"I owe my life to those laws.\"\n\nRight to Life's proposal would prohibit health insurance plans from including abortion coverage as a standard feature. The nonprofit has promoted it as a means to ensure that taxpayer-subsidized policies offered under the Affordable Care Act do not include abortion coverage.\n\nCITIZENS INITIATIVE\n\nHow it's done:\n\n\"In order to exercise the right to initiate legislation (initiative), a citizen or group must secure, on petitions, the signatures of registered electors in an amount not less than 8 percent of the total vote cast for all candidates for governor at the last gubernatorial election.\" What the Legislature can do:\n\n\"...The legislature has 40 days from the time it receives the petition to enact or reject the proposed law or to propose a different measure on the same question. If not enacted, the original initiative proposal and any different measure passed by the legislature must go before the voters as a ballot proposal.\" How often it's happened:\n\n\"...There have been five instances of the legislature approving initiatives proposed by the citizens, which eliminated the need for the measures to go before voters. These citizen-initiated and legislature approved acts were 1964 PA 2, 1987 PA 59, 1990 PA 211, 2004 PA 135, and 2006 PA 325.\" Source: 2009-10 Michigan Manual\n\nThe bill would apply to all health plans sold in Michigan, however, whether or not they are offered through an Obamacare exchange. Federal law prohibits taxpayer money from directly funding abortion, but the ACA also allows states to \"opt out\" of offering plans with abortion coverage.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Gretchen Whitmer, D-East Lansing, blasted the proposal on Monday, calling it \"rape insurance\" because it would make women plan ahead for the unexpected. \"It's one of the most misogynistic proposals I have ever seen in the Michigan Legislature,\" she said.\n\nKessling and other women at the Right to Life press conference criticized Whitmer's statement, suggesting her rhetoric was designed to placate \"the abortion lobby\" at the expense of children conceived in rape.\n\n\"Abortion is not health care,\" argued Mary Rathke of Essexville, who said her biological mother was raped before giving her up for adoption. \"To suggest that abortion should especially be covered in cases of rape says nothing more than that a health insurance contract should be a contract on our life. We implore leaders like Senator Whitmer to stop targeting us as worthy of death because of someone else's crime.\"\n\nSpokesperson Bob McCann said that Whitmer's \"heart goes out\" to the individuals who spoke at the Capitol on Tuesday but pointed to obvious policy disagreements.\n\n\"Senator Whitmer certainly has nothing but the utmost compassion for anyone who has been effected by a sexual assault,\" McCann said. \"But the bottom line is, women should have the options they need in front of them at that point. They shouldn't have to plan ahead for that circumstance.\"\n\nSenate Democrats held a press conference of their own on Tuesday shortly after noon, sharing the story of a Michigan woman who learned that her unborn baby had a rare brain malformation and was unlikely to live to his full term. The woman chose to terminate the pregnancy by inducing labor, an expensive process that included a three-day hospital stay.\n\n\"The stories we heard (in committee hearings last year) were real stories with real women where the largest costs were hospital stays,\" said state Sen. Rebekah Warren, D-Ann Arbor. \"To have somebody who has a nursery at home, a wanted pregnancy and something went wrong, to have to face the fact they might have to pay ten or twelve thousand dollars for a surgery they never wanted is despicable.\"\n\nMichigan's Republican-led Legislature approved a similar proposal last year, but Gov. Rick Snyder vetoed the bill. The first-term Republican criticized the measure for \"interfering\" with the private marketplace and said he did not think it was appropriate tell women impregnated through rape or incest that they need to purchase elective insurance coverage.\n\n\"We are all disappointed that Governor Snyder vetoed (the bill last year),\" said Rathke. \"He even cited the lack of a rape exception as one reason. We are people. We are not exceptions. We are all convinced that if the governor knew our stories, he might look at things differently.\"\n\nUnder the citizens initiative process outlined in the Michigan constitution, the state Legislature has 40 days to consider Right to Life's proposal. Legislative approval would bypass the governor's veto pen and enact the measure into law. Doing nothing would send the measure to the ballot in 2014.\n\nRight to Life lobbyists say they are confident that lawmakers will approve the bill by the end of the year, but Republican leadership has not yet confirmed a plan of action or timeline.\n\nJonathan Oosting is a Capitol reporter for MLive Media Group.
