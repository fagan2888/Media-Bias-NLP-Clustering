Once he cleared the corner he sped 69 yards for the TD. He added another TD run early in the second quarter on a seven-yard run.\n\nAPSU challenged late in the half, moving the ball down to the one-yard line after some impressive runs by both walk-on freshman running back Otis Gerron and freshman quarterback Darrien Boone. The combination of Boone and Gerron helped lead APSU to its only score, a one-yard plunge by Boone with 8:23 left in the third period.\n\nRobertson, who completed two-of-three first-half passes for three yards in the first half, more than made up for it in the second half. He threw for 219 yards in the second half, completing 10-of-13 passes.\n\nAustin Peay finished the game with 10 first down compared to 27 for the Redbirds. APSU allowed 496 yards total offense\u2014256 on the ground and 240 via the air. Coprich ended with 156 yards rushing on 14 attempts.\n\nAPSU had 115 yard passing\u201489 from Mickey Macius (6 of 11) with Darrien Boone throwing for 26. Gerron led the Govs with 38 yards rushing while Boone had 25 and APSU\u2019s only TD.\n\nDefensively, Buddy Mitchell led the Govs\u2019 effort with seven stops while defensive tackle Malcolm Goines had APSU\u2019s only sack.\n\nVideo \u2013 Kirby Cannon\n\nSections\n\nTopics", "article_metadata": {"description": "APSU Sports Information Office Normal, IL - Illinois State remained undefeated as it defeated Austin Peay State University, 55-6, Saturday night at Hancock", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Clarksville, TN Online", "description": "APSU Sports Information Office Normal, IL \u2013 Illinois State remained undefeated as it defeated Austin Peay State University, 55-6, Saturday night at Hancock Stadium.
