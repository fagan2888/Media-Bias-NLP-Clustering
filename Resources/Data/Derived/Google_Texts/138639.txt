SYRACUSE, N.Y. -- An Eastwood company that processes claims for a financially troubled health insurer laid off another 35 employees today.

POMCO said more job cuts related to the shutdown of Health Republic of New York may occur during the first half of the year.

Health Republic is an insurance company that debuted in 2013 and sold plans on the New York health insurance exchange to capture new business generated by the federal Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, which requires nearly all Americans to have health insurance. It contracted with POMCO to administer claims and provide other back-office services.

Regulators ordered Health Republic to cease operations because it was going broke. The company hit the financial skids after selling insurance at rock-bottom prices and receiving less money than expected from the federal government.

POMCO hired 125 people to handle claims for Health Republic. Since October, POMCO has cut 112 of those jobs.

"Services related to the wind down of Health Republic will continue during the first half of this year with some remaining staff changes during that time," POMCO said today in a prepared statement.
