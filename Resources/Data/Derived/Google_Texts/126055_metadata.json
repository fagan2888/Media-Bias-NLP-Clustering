One of the most obvious examples of this is just a bit further northward, but right here in North America.\n\nConsider Stephen Harper, the Prime Minster of Canada. First elected in 2006 on a campaign pledge to, among other things, foster close ties to President George W Bush and America\u2019s efforts to fight terrorism, Harper has over the past eight years championed free trade, federal government spending reductions, and a significant boost in oil production. Today the Canadian government is on track to be debt-free in 2015, as Harper tirelessly lobbies the U.S. to become more cooperative with oil pipeline projects and energy exploration.\n\nThen there\u2019s Alison Redford, the Premier of the Province of Alberta (a provincial premier is a counterpart to the Governor of a U.S. state). Redford agreed to serve on a panel with former Vice President Al Gore to discuss oil energy production and \u201cclimate change\u201d at last month\u2019s World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and the panel discussion quickly turned in to a debate between the two.\n\nAfter the event both Al Gore and the Huffington Post were convinced that Al Gore\u2019s presentation had been brilliant. Yet European media marveled at Redford\u2019s willingness to call-out Gore\u2019s \u201cerroneous\u201d assertions about petroleum-based energy and her \u201cnew way of looking at things\u201d pertaining to economic growth.\n\nThen consider the country of Australia and it\u2019s new Prime Minister Tony Abbott. It wasn\u2019t sufficient that in 2013 Australia was already a global leader in iron ore and timber production and that\u2019s its\u2019 government was set to close out the calendar year debt-free \u2013 no, the citizenry of the land \u201cdown under\u201d wanted an even more business-friendly and fiscally sound government for themselves, so they elected a candidate for Prime Mister who repeated from the campaign trail that the global climate change agenda is \u201cabsolute crap.\u201d\n\nShortly before his election win Abbott was asked in a nationwide television interview \u201cwith our government debt so low, why do you want to cut government spending even further?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause there\u2019s still waste in our government, that\u2019s why\u201d Abbott replied. Shortly after his September 7, 2013 landslide victory he set a date of July 1, 2014 by which he intends to eliminate his nation\u2019s \u201ccarbon tax.\u201d\n\nAnd \u2013 gasp! \u2013 could it be that the European nations are abandoning their \u201cgreen\u201d status? It would appear that way. Last month the European commission, the legislative body of the union that sets policies shared among the member nations, voted to officially abandon specific sets of \u201cclimate change protocols.\u201d Even more stunning, the commission appears to be preparing to allow fracking among the member nations, with the hope of making Europe a leader in the global natural gas and oil shale markets.\n\nAmerica may very well still be with Obama, Biden and the Democrat party on \u201cevery major issue.\u201d But the rest of the industrialized world is moving in the exact opposite direction of our President and Vice President, away from the Obama traditions of dangerous government debt and economy-killing environmental zealotry.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Vice President Joe Biden announced two days ago that the American people agree with the Democrat party \u201con every major issue.\u201d   .05/23/2016 20:34:00PM EST.", "author": "Austin Hill", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Vice President Joe Biden announced two days ago that the American people agree with the Democrat party \u201con every major issue.\u201d", "title": "- Yes, It\u2019s A \u201cMajor Issue:\u201d The Industrialized World Is Abandoning The U.S.", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/austinhill/2014/02/16/yes-its-a-major-issue-the-industrialized-world-is-abandoning-the-us-n1795797", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/38/1a5b2af9-9de6-4767-9741-4b63dba55569.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Vice President Joe Biden announced two days ago that the American people agree with the Democrat party \u201con every major issue.\u201d", "title": "- Yes, It\u2019s A \u201cMajor Issue:\u201d The Industrialized World Is Abandoning The U.S.", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/austinhill/2014/02/16/yes-its-a-major-issue-the-industrialized-world-is-abandoning-the-us-n1795797", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/38/1a5b2af9-9de6-4767-9741-4b63dba55569.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Yes, It\u2019s A \u201cMajor Issue:\u201d The Industrialized World Is Abandoning The U.S. , Austin Hill, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd7c5\"", "article_summary": "One of the most obvious examples of this is just a bit further northward, but right here in North America.\nAmerica may very well still be with Obama, Biden and the Democrat party on \u201cevery major issue.\u201d But the rest of the industrialized world is moving in the exact opposite direction of our President and Vice President, away from the Obama traditions of dangerous government debt and economy-killing environmental zealotry.\nAfter the event both Al Gore and the Huffington Post were convinced that Al Gore\u2019s presentation had been brilliant.\n\u2013 could it be that the European nations are abandoning their \u201cgreen\u201d status?\nThen there\u2019s Alison Redford, the Premier of the Province of Alberta (a provincial premier is a counterpart to the Governor of a U.S. state)."}
