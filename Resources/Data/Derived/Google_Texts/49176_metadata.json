Film, Fashion and Food.\n\nFirst of all we have RightBread from Toronto, Ontario which is creating something that I want (and need). Bread which is high in protein and low in carbs. Hmmmm sounds like magic. Well watch the pitch video and they will show you how. They have created a tasty and health bread that includes a secret ingredient: Maple Syrup. Gluten free too. This is a re-launch of a campaign which ran a few weeks ago. The organizers have adjusted their campaign and have hit their goal. Expect the stretch goals soon. WhatI want to know is how soon I will find this product at my local grocer. Good pitch video too.\n\nCanvas Custom Sunglasses are taking a different tack in how they are creating sunglasses. You can actually change the printed design of the actual frame. So if you are tired of black or tortoise you can go crazy with whatever type of color and look you like. There is definitely an opportunity for corporate branding here too. They are starting out with their take on the classic wayfarer look and you can get a pair for only $30 \u2013 if you act soon. Funds are going to complete their customization application on their web site. I am buying a pair.\n\nSneakerheadz. Really this is a sub-culture I really have no idea about but in watching the pitch video it was oddly fascinating. There are collectors for just about everything \u2013 and as I have come to discover there is a committed community which collectors shoes. Not just any shoes but sneakers. Collectors are willing to pay thousands of dollars to own a pair of rare \u201cdeadstock\u201d shoes. Just like collecting fine art. Watch the pitch video. This is being put together by David Friendly who was nominated for an Academy Award for Little Miss Sunshine. He claims to be partial to his Addidas Superstars.\n\nIf you would like the chance to have your crowdfunding campaign featured on Crowdfund Insider please email us at info@crowdfundinsider.com. You can direct tweet us too \u2013 but they frequently get lost in the avalanche known as twitter. As always we suggest y0u follow best practices in creating your crowdfunding campaign. Slava Ruben, CEO and Co-Founder of Indiegogo, recently gave some excellent advice at Disrupt Europe which you can view here. We concur.
