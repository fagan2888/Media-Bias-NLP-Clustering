Dennis Martinez faces charges of menacing, interference with educational facility

Lafayette police today identified Arvada resident Dennis Martinez as the suspect arrested Friday afternoon in connection with threats made against Lafayette's Centaurus High School.

Martinez, 21, was arrested on suspicion of interference with staff, faculty and students of an education facility, and menacing, police Chief Rick Bashor said in an email.

Bashor released the arrest information this morning after police refused on Friday to identify the man they had arrested in connection with the threats.

Anonymous phone threats against Centaurus caused the high school and two neighboring Lafayette schools to be put on lockout Friday morning.
