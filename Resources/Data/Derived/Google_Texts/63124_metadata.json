Is Sharpton on the level here or just spinning for him? Before you answer, here\u2019s a bit from the sequel to \u201cGame Change\u201d last year:\n\n\u201cObama had little patience for the \u2018professional left,\u2019 and vanishingly close to zero for what one of his senior African American aides, Michael Strautmanis, referred to as \u2018professional blacks\u2019 (as opposed to black professionals),\u201d authors Mark Halperin and John Heilemann wrote on page 39 of the book. \u201cApart from Georgia congressman John Lewis and Jim Clyburn of South Carolina, Obama had nearly as much contempt for the CBC as he did for the Tea Party Caucus.\u201d \u201cNew York\u2019s Charlie Rangel he derided as a hack; Jesse Jackson Sr. was effectively banned from the White House,\u201d according to the authors. \u201cObama remembered all too well a conversation with [Cornel] West in 2009, in which the professor used the precious time to complain about his seating at the inauguration.\u201d\u2026 Obama, according to the authors, has struggled with the left and the black community. \u201cOne day in the spring of 2011, as he sat with some staffers preparing for a speech to Al Sharpton\u2019s National Action Network, Obama rattled off a list of his policies,\u201d the authors note in the same passage. \u201cCracking down on predatory lending. Education reform. Student loan reform. Most important, health care reform. All with an outsize impact on African Americans. All achieved at a time when half of the GOP believed he\u2019d been born in Kenya . Obama threw up his hands. \u2018After all that,\u2019 he said, \u2018am I still not black enough?\u2019\u201d\n\nObama\u2019s always preferred to let surrogates handle race cards on his behalf, notwithstanding the occasional \u201cpolice acted stupidly\u201d or \u201cif I had a son he would have looked like Trayvon\u201d comment when he\u2019s cornered on some bit of hot-button racial politics and has to speak up. The problem with surrogates, though, is that they bring their own baggage to the debate; in Sharpton\u2019s case, that baggage could fill a few dozen shipping containers. Go figure that O doesn\u2019t want this cretin, with the Tawana Brawley hoax and Crown Heights riot on his CV, appointing himself some sort of unofficial White House mouthpiece in attacking critics of White House policies as racist. That\u2019s a headache for O under any circumstances but it would have been especially poisonous pre-reelection, when Democrats were desperate to keep disaffected white voters who helped elect him in 2008 in the fold. If you\u2019re Obama, and you know you\u2019ll have 95+ percent of the black vote on election day anyway, how does it benefit you to have Al Sharpton running around trying to \u201chelp\u201d? Of course he told the guy to shut up.\n\nMy guess is, if he thought he could get away with it, he wouldn\u2019t meet with \u201cprofessional blacks\u201d like Sharpton at all. He went more than two years without holding a meeting with the Congressional Black Caucus, until enough complaints trickled into the media that he felt he had no choice. Even his overrated speech on race during the 2008 campaign, which sent thrills up the legs of media liberals everywhere, was something he delivered only after the Jeremiah Wright story had blown up on him and he needed to do damage control. (Speaking of which, when was the last time he saw Wright? Six, maybe seven years ago?) Lord knows he\u2019s not above letting leftists play defense for him by lobbing racial grenades at the right (unless, like Sharpton, they\u2019re so compromised politically that he could be hurt by it), but I think he came to the conclusion \u2014 and not recently either \u2014 that talking about this subject himself will almost always do more harm than good. It won\u2019t win him any more black votes and it might cost him votes among other groups, whether because they think it\u2019s unpresidential and divisive to play racial politics or because they perceive that O\u2019s \u201csiding\u201d with blacks in discussing racial matters. Look no further than what he told the New Yorker about his race making him less popular with some people and more popular with others, a truism that somehow became major news yesterday because it was O himself who said it. When it comes to self-serving accusations of racism, he\u2019s better off not bothering. He\u2019s got Chris Matthews for that.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "\u201cHe has said, \u2018No, I don\u2019t agree with you pushing that.\u2019\u201d", "title": "Al Sharpton: Obama\u2019s asked black leaders not to push the idea that his opponents are racist", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/01/21/al-sharpton-obamas-asked-black-leaders-not-to-push-the-idea-that-his-opponents-are-racist/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-21T19:41:52+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-21T17:59:12+00:00"}, "keywords": "black, double down, jackson, leaders, Obama, race, racism, sharpton, voters, white,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce8bf\"", "article_summary": "My guess is, if he thought he could get away with it, he wouldn\u2019t meet with \u201cprofessional blacks\u201d like Sharpton at all.\nAl Sharpton: Obama\u2019s asked black leaders not to push the idea that his opponents are racistposted at 2:41 pm on January 21, 2014 by AllahpunditVia NRO, I\u2019m late to this but wanted to flag it as a postscript to O\u2019s comments on race affecting his job approval.\nAll achieved at a time when half of the GOP believed he\u2019d been born in Kenya .\nWhen it comes to self-serving accusations of racism, he\u2019s better off not bothering.\nIs Sharpton on the level here or just spinning for him?"}
