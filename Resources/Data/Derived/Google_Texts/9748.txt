Somerset-based SHI International Corp., a provider of information technology products, announced Wednesday it has become an authorized reseller of the Google Apps suite of communication and collaboration tools.

According to the announcement, SHI will now provide Google Apps for Business, Google Geospatial Solutions, and Google Search Appliances to its business, government and academic customers.

Businesses procuring Google Apps through SHI will gain focused support and detailed attention to their specific needs.

The Google Apps tools will add to SHIâ€™s already diverse cloud portfolio, which accounted for more than $300 million of the $5 billion overall revenue in 2013.

"For a quarter century, SHI's expansion has been driven by our ability to efficiently connect IT organizations with the technology solutions that help meet their strategic objectives," said Thai Lee, President and CEO of SHI International Corp.

Lee was named to the 2014 NJBIZ Power 100 list.
