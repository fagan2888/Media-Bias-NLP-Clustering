The committee will meet for the third time on Friday, and though the group has not yet released an agenda, past meetings have heavily focused on climate change.\n\nDuring DGAC\u2019s second meeting on Jan. 13, Kate Clancy, a food systems consultant and Senior Fellow in the Minnesota Institute for Sustainable Agriculture at the University of Minnesota, was brought to speak on \u201csustainability.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter 30 years of waiting, the fact that this committee is addressing sustainability issues brings me a lot of pleasure,\u201d she began. Clancy went on to advocate that Americans should become vegetarians in order to achieve sustainability in the face of \u201cclimate change.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat pattern of eating best contributes to food security and the sustainability of land air and water?\u201d Clancy asked. \u201cThe simple answer is a plant-based diet.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, this is not new, this idea of how important plant-based diets are has been around for, gosh, 30-40 years,\u201d she said. \u201cBefore that for people who long ago were eating vegetarian.\u201d\n\nClancy said plant-based diets lower the risk of cardiovascular disease and have a \u201csmaller ecological impact\u201d on \u201cdrought, climate change, soil erosion, pesticides and antibiotics in water supplies.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn terms of keeping a broader idea of food security in your minds it would be perilous, I would think, for this committee or anybody else to not be taking climate change into account in any of the deliberations about sustainability,\u201d she said.\n\nClancy said beef production is the \u201cgreatest concern.\u201d\n\nMeat production is harmful to the environment because of manure runoff and \u201cmethane production by cattle,\u201d she said, which has \u201ca much stronger effect on climate change than carbon dioxide does per unit of methane.\u201d\n\nFollowing the talk, Dr. Miriam Nelson, a member of the DGAC committee, thanked Clancy for her \u201creally, really wonderful presentation.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the good news here, in my mind, is that when we look at actually the current dietary guidelines\u2014with the exception of fish, because I think fish is an issue\u2014really we are talking about eating more plants, fewer animals,\u201d she said.\n\nNelson is DGAC\u2019s work group lead for \u201cEnvironmental Determinants of Food, Diet, and Health.\u201d She said eating less meat could lower Americans\u2019 carbon footprint.\n\n\u201cEating fewer animals, but choosing those wisely, and reducing sugar, refined grains, things like that, that diet that we already have stated from the evidence, if we were to get Americans to eat it, would actually have a lower footprint than what we are currently doing,\u201d Nelson said.\n\nNelson is a nutrition professor at Tufts University and founder of the \u201cStrong Women Initiative,\u201d which seeks to drive \u201csocial change by empowering women to be agents of change in the area of nutrition, physical activity, and obesity prevention.\u201d\n\nShe said being a vegetarian is \u201cvery compelling\u201d to young people.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been doing some work right now at Tufts, this message is actually one that is very compelling, especially to young people,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we can start coupling this message to young people we might actually have the ability to get people more motivated, and to have companies respond to that because it is marketable. I think we\u2019re at that point.\u201d\n\nAlice Lichtenstein, the committee\u2019s vice chair and a Stanley N. Gershoff Professor of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University, is mainly concerned with changing the eating habits of individuals through policy.\n\nDuring a recent lecture at Boston University, Lichtenstein talked about \u201cpotential solutions\u201d to get Americans to eat healthier.\n\n\u201cSo, everybody probably recognizes this gentleman,\u201d she said, showing a slide of Ronald McDonald. \u201cWell, I do spend, usually once a year, some time in Finland, and a radical group actually captured Ronald McDonald, and you see what happened.\u201d\n\nThe slide, which reads \u201cpotential solutions,\u201d shows an image of the beloved clown being decapitated by a guillotine. A Finnish group called the \u201cFood Liberation Army\u201d held a Ronald McDonald \u201chostage\u201d in 2011 and released al-Qaeda style ransom videos.\n\nThey later beheaded him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not necessarily advocating this,\u201d Lichtenstein said, laughing. \u201cI don\u2019t think it really solves the problem, but you can see different people have different\u2014take different ways of dealing with things.\u201d\n\nLichtenstein disapproves of fast food in general. A double cheeseburger is \u201cnot something I usually order,\u201d and it is \u201ctoo embarrassing\u201d for someone to order a \u201cGreat Biggie\u201d at Wendy\u2019s, she said.\n\nShe is also a supporter of former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg\u2019s soda ban and pointed to the law as a \u201csocietal change\u201d that can help alter people\u2019s behavior.\n\nLichtenstein said Bloomberg\u2019s law, which would have banned businesses from selling sodas over 16 ounces, \u201chas been a little bit more tricky.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs you know, there is no ban on super size soda\u2014that was blocked by the courts,\u201d she said. \u201cBut there has been efforts to educate people [sic].\u201d She also praised Mexico for instituting an 8 percent tax on soda and junk food and argued for a federal law to require calorie labeling at all restaurants.\n\n\u201cCan we translate nutrition science into public policy? Sure, we do it all the time,\u201d Lichtenstein said. \u201cThe challenge really is how to get people to actually embrace the policy that is provided.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd can we implement changes based on public policy? I think we are now beginning to learn how to do it, and I think we need to put more emphasis now on figuring out how to change behavior, than on the little details about whether a little more of this is better,\u201d she said.\n\nThe dietary guidelines are updated every five years, and are used by the Departments of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Agriculture (USDA) to \u201cmake appropriate changes and program updates.\u201d\n\nThe current recommendations are used for nutrition facts labeling, \u201cnational objectives on nutrition and weight status,\u201d and \u201cnutrition and health education programs\u201d run by the Administration on Community Living, Indian Health Service, and Office on Women\u2019s Health .\n\nThe USDA uses the guidelines to calibrate benefits and allotments for food stamps, and to \u201cguide decisions on food purchasing, create research grant opportunities, analyze food consumption survey data, and monitor other national initiatives.\u201d\n\nThe 2015 dietary guidelines will be released next fall.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Environmentalism creeps into food policy", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "The federal committee crafting the 2015\u00a0\u201cDietary Guidelines for Americans\u201d features radical nutritionists who favor Americans moving to \u201cplant-based\u201d diets and a vice chair that laughs about", "title": "Meet the Radicals Creating the New Federal Dietary Guidelines", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/issues/meet-the-radicals-creating-the-new-federal-dietary-guidelines/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/vegetarian-150x150.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The federal committee crafting the 2015\u00a0\u201cDietary Guidelines for Americans\u201d features radical nut", "creator": "@LizWFB", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/vegetarian-150x150.jpg", "title": "Meet the Radicals Creating the New Federal Dietary Guidelines", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID", "pages": 282024895179874}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (DGAC) is responsible for creating new nutrition standards that are used to create policy at the federal level.\nBY: Follow @LizWFBThe federal committee crafting the 2015 \u201cDietary Guidelines for Americans\u201d features radical nutritionists who favor Americans moving to \u201cplant-based\u201d diets and a vice chair that laughs about sending Ronald McDonald to the guillotine.\n\u201cThe challenge really is how to get people to actually embrace the policy that is provided.\u201d\u201cAnd can we implement changes based on public policy?\nNelson is DGAC\u2019s work group lead for \u201cEnvironmental Determinants of Food, Diet, and Health.\u201d She said eating less meat could lower Americans\u2019 carbon footprint.\nThe committee will meet for the third time on Friday, and though the group has not yet released an agenda, past meetings have heavily focused on climate change."}
