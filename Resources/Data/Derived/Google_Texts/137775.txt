After two men were arrested for crimes involving Westar contractors in Reno County last month, authorities in another Kansas county are alerting residents of upcoming electric meter replacements in order to avoid similar incidents.

Westar will begin replacing meters in Harvey County on Monday, Sheriff T. Walton said. The utility will begin in the southwest part of the county as well as northeast Newton.

"The installers will knock on your door to let you know they are there to change the meter out," Sheriff Walton said. "They will be wearing vests and hard hats with identification of 'Oasis working for Westar.'"

Walton added that everyone’s meter will get changed out, saying it will just take a few minutes but short service interruption is expected.

Westar contractors will inform the sheriff’s office where they will be working each day.

Last month, 66-year-old Marc Miller was arrested in Hutchinson after allegedly pointing a gun at a Westar employee after installing an electric meter. He faces assault and kidnapping charges.

The week before, 62-year-old Kerry Getz was arrested after authorities said he tried to attack a Westar employee following a meter replacement. He was booked for aggravated assault, aggravated battery and criminal damage to property.
