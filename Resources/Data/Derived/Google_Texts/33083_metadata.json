Whatever people might think of Johnson\u2019s actions in southeast Asia, it\u2019s worth pausing to remember his other war: to secure a social safety net at home.\n\nWithin the space of a couple of years, Johnson introduced the Economic Opportunity Act (1964), the Food Stamp Act (1964), the Civil Rights Act (1964), the Social Security Act amendments creating Medicare and Medicaid (1965) and the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (1965). He increased funding for social security pensions, unemployment compensation, public housing and Aid to Families with Dependent Children.\n\nIn the space of five years, official poverty rates in the US dropped from 19% to 12.1%. Child poverty fell from 23% to 14%. But at the end of those five years Johnson was gone and a new war had begun: the war on welfare.\n\nThe anniversary comes at a significant time for Australians. While in opposition in 2012, then-shadow treasurer Joe Hockey had promised to end \u201cthe age of entitlement\u201d in Australia. The May budget \u2013 Hockey\u2019s first as treasurer \u2013 is a big step on what may be a long road. But the US is much further down that road, and the Nixon administration started the journey in 1969.\n\nEnding entitlement\n\nRichard Nixon replaced Johnson during a period of severe economic downturn. The escalating Vietnam War effort had pushed the US budget into a US$25.2 billion deficit in 1968, the highest by far since World War Two. Gross federal debt had risen almost 100%, while military expenditures gave rise to inflation, causing the price of US goods to increase and overseas markets to disappear. The US experienced its first stagflation.\n\nStagflation cast doubt over the prevailing Keynesian theory of demand management. The New Right broke into mainstream economics at this time, offering \u201csmall state\u201d solutions. One of this group\u2019s leading figures, Milton Friedman, blamed legal minimum wages and minimum prices, social security programs and \u201cso-called public housing\u201d for the economic crisis.\n\nFriedman consulted to the Nixon administration, while Nixon employed prominent sociologist Daniel P. Moynihan as Head of Urban Affairs. While Friedman linked the economic crisis to the welfare state, Moynihan toured the country explaining that welfare itself was in crisis. He said licentious poverty relief had caused rioting, disorder and the disintegration of (mostly black) American families.\n\nBy the time Nixon came up for re-election, anti-welfare rhetoric was a vote winner. His second campaign centred on \u201csmall government\u201d, asking voters to choose between welfare cuts or higher taxes. He told his cabinet:\n\nPeople are for spending \u2026 You have to hit on higher taxes. By cutting the budget back, we are avoiding more taxes and that\u2019s the line we have to use.\n\nNixon dismantled most of the agencies of Johnson\u2019s War on Poverty. Ronald Reagan, also advised by Friedman, made further progress. Bill Clinton, in a show of bipartisanship, set about to \u201cend welfare as we have come to know it\u201d by introducing Workfare and lifetime welfare limits of 60 months under the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families Act.\n\nAnd now the House Republicans\u2019 2015 budget wants to claw back government spending by US$5.1 trillion over the next ten years - and 60% of this will come from welfare and training programs for the poor.\n\nChanging the mood\n\nOnce citizens lose entitlements, it\u2019s difficult to get them back. Even harder is bringing people back to entitlement, especially if talk of welfare conjures an imaginary straight line to tax hikes, economic crisis and social breakdown.\n\nAAP/Dan Himbrechts\n\nBarack Obama learnt this the hard way when he pushed through the Affordable Care Act, expanding coverage of Medicaid and providing subsidies for purchasing health insurance, on a sliding scale, for people earning up to 400% of the poverty line. This is hardly the \u201csocialist utopia\u201d Fox News host Bill O\u2019Reilly suggested.\n\nIt may seem strange to Australians, but a slight majority of Americans (51%) didn\u2019t want to help the poor purchase health cover. While 91% of black Americans supported the Affordable Care Act, only 29% of white Americans did. Among the common reasons were fear of higher taxes and a belief that there should be \u201cno entitlement to government assistance\u201d.\n\nLessons for Australia\n\nThe debate around welfare is ideological and partisan, no matter what country you\u2019re in. Ideology doesn\u2019t change much. Social democrats support welfare. Neoliberals don\u2019t, or only accept it in a very limited form. Success, either way, depends on the circumstances.\n\nLike Nixon, Hockey is using an economic crisis to achieve cuts to welfare. Only this time there is no economic crisis. If we believe respected economists like Saul Eslake, there\u2019s not even a budget emergency. But that won\u2019t stop the Australian government from pushing.\n\nAmerica may be much further down the road, but it looks like Australia will be heading in the same direction.", "article_metadata": {"description": "2014 marks the 50th anniversary of president Lyndon Johnson\u2019s \u201cWar on Poverty\u201d in the United States.
