They treat patients regardless of their ability to pay. And the increased need is a surprising result to some clinic leaders, who thought the Affordable Care Act would mean fewer people needing charity care.\n\nAt the Charlotte Community Health Clinic, Nurse Practitioner Martha Brinsko treats a lot of uninsured patients for diabetes. Diana Coble is one of them.\n\n\u201cMost mornings when you check your sugar, what would you say kind of the average is?\u201d Brinsko asks Coble.\n\nCoble hesitates before explaining she ran out of what she needs to check it, and she didn\u2019t have the gas money to get back here sooner. Brinsko says Coble can get what she needs here.\n\n\u201cIf you need to get more than one box, get more than one box,\u201d Brinsko says. \u201cBut you need to check them every morning so that we can adjust things.\u201d\n\nCoble is unemployed, lives with her sister, and relies on the clinic for health care.\n\n\u201cThey do a great job with everything,\u201d Coble says, \u201cand I couldn't do without \u2018em.\u201d\n\nThe clinic\u2019s executive director, Nancy Hudson, expected the Affordable Care Act exchange, or marketplace, to reduce the number of patients like Coble. But Hudson says the opposite happened.\n\n\u201cWhat we found within our patient population and within the community is that a lot of the advertisement and information about the marketplace brought people that didn't know anything about free clinics and did not qualify for any of the programs within the ACA marketplace,\u201d Hudson says.\n\nThe Medicaid gap is a big part of this. Obamacare was designed to cover the poorest people through Medicaid expansion, but the Supreme Court made that optional for states.\n\nBen Money is president of the association that represents North Carolina\u2019s community health centers.\n\n\u201cOver half of the people that we see would've been eligible for Medicaid expansion had the state elected to exercise that option,\u201d Money says.\n\nNorth Carolina is among about twenty states that said no to Medicaid expansion. Many are in the South and under Republican leadership, like Louisiana.\n\nDr. Gary Wiltz is the CEO of 10 community health centers in southwestern Louisiana.\n\n\u201cWe've gone from 10,000 patients to 20,000 in the last six or seven years, so we've doubled,\u201d he says.\n\nDr. Wiltz says there are other things at play. The slow economic recovery hasn\u2019t reached many of the poorest people, and some who do qualify for Obamacare subsidies say their options are still too expensive.\n\n\u201cThe need keeps increasing, and I think that's reflected throughout all the states,\u201d he says.\n\nDr. Wiltz also heads the board of directors for the National Association of Community Health Centers. He says clinics are packed even in states that expanded Medicaid. After all, the clinics treat Medicaid patients too.\n\nBack at the clinic in Charlotte, executive director Nancy Hudson points out there\u2019s another part of the Affordable Care Act helping with all this: additional funding for community health centers.\n\nHudson found out last week her clinic is getting about $700,000 to expand in partnership with Goodwill.\n\n\u201cMany of their clients did not have any access to health care,\u201d she says. \u201cThey can't train and sustain a job if they don't have the basic needs taken care of, and health care is one of \u2018em.\u201d\n\nNationwide, the federal government estimates its latest round of funding will lead to about 650,000 people getting better access to that basic need.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health", "description": "In Charlotte and across the country, there\u2019s a growing need at community health centers.
