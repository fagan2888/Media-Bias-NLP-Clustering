N.J. POLITICS ROUNDUP A collection of political news from the Statehouse and around New Jersey

TRENTON — Gov. Chris Christie on Thursday signed controversial bills that allows for fast-tracking the privatization of many public water systems in New Jersey and would fundamentally change planning and development in the Meadowlands district.
