(AP) \u2014 Dawn Staley appeared in the women\u2019s national semifinals three times as a player. Now, she\u2019s back for the first time as a coach, guiding Final Four newcomer South Carolina.\n\nAnd, the former Virginia star, whose Southeastern Conference champions square off against Notre Dame on Sunday is paying tribute to an old and dear mentor during the Gamecocks debut on college basketball\u2019s biggest stage.\n\nJohn Chaney won 741 games during a long career at Cheney State and Temple, where Staley made the transition from WNBA standout to coaching. He reached the Elite Eight of the men\u2019s NCAA Tournament five times \u2014 and lost.\n\n\u201cHe did not get to the point of the Final Four, but certainly I dedicate our time being at the Final Four to him, and all the other players that have affected my life as a coach,\u201d Staley said Saturday.\n\nStaley spent eight years at Temple before taking over a struggling South Carolina program and transforming the Gamecocks (34-2) into a national power over the past seven seasons.\n\nChaney, 83, helped her changed the culture of Temple\u2019s women\u2019s program, too. And, Staley hasn\u2019t forgotten.\n\n\u201cA lot of times our male counterpart at different universities, they\u2019re not as open to someone like coach Chaney. He would come to our practices, he would allow us to come into his practice and learn,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cHe is a perfectionist. He put his team into positions to win basketball games that no one else thought they should have been in,\u201d Staley added. \u201cFor that reason, he\u2019ll always be one of the best mentors that I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d\n\nPerennial national championship contender Notre Dame (35-2) is appearing in its fifth consecutive Final Four. The Irish took a perfect record into last year\u2019s title game, where they lost to unbeaten Connecticut.\n\nCoach Muffet McGraw has her team back in the national semifinals, despite losing three starters \u2014 two of them first-round WNBA draft picks.\n\n\u201cOut of all those five, this team has improved the most,\u201d McGraw said. \u201cI think this is the youngest team we\u2019ve ever taken. Not a senior in the starting lineup.\n\n\u201cFor them to get it together and just keep getting better, it\u2019s been really fun to watch.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Gamecocks\u2019 Staley dedicates Final Four trip to John Chaney", "title": "Gamecocks\u2019 Staley dedicates Final Four trip to John Chaney", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Gamecocks\u2019 Staley dedicates Final Four trip to John Chaney", "title": "Gamecocks\u2019 Staley dedicates Final Four trip to John Chaney", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/04/04/gamecocks_staley_dedicates_final_four_trip_to_john_chaney/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/ncaa-south-carolina-final-four-basketball.jpeg1-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Gamecocks\u2019 Staley dedicates Final Four trip to John Chaney", "title": "Gamecocks\u2019 Staley dedicates Final Four trip to John Chaney", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/ncaa-south-carolina-final-four-basketball.jpeg1-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Fred Goodall", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8afb\"", "article_summary": "John Chaney won 741 games during a long career at Cheney State and Temple, where Staley made the transition from WNBA standout to coaching.\nTopics: From the Wires, Entertainment News, NewsTAMPA, Fla.
