Never being able to say that you were wrong is a serious character flaw even if the consequences of that refusal to admit error fall only on a few people. But moral cowardice should be outright disqualifying in anyone seeking high office. Think about it. Suppose, as is all too possible, that the next president ends up confronting some kind of crisis \u2014 economic, environmental, foreign \u2014 undreamed of in his or her current political philosophy. We really, really don\u2019t want the job of responding to that crisis dictated by someone who still can\u2019t bring himself to admit that invading Iraq was a disaster but health reform wasn\u2019t. I still think this election should turn almost entirely on the issues. But if we must talk about character, let\u2019s talk about what matters, namely intellectual integrity.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"If we must talk about character, let's talk about what matters -- intellectual integrity\"", "title": "Paul Krugman blasts GOP candidates: \u201cMoral cowardice should be outright disqualifying in anyone seeking high office\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "\"If we must talk about character, let's talk about what matters -- intellectual integrity\"", "title": "Paul Krugman blasts GOP candidates: \u201cMoral cowardice should be outright disqualifying in anyone seeking high office\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/01/paul_krugman_none_of_the_current_presidential_candidates_have_the_one_key_trait_necessary_for_the_job/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2010/01/why_obama_should_not_pick_krugman_for_the_fed-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"If we must talk about character, let's talk about what matters -- intellectual integrity\"", "title": "Paul Krugman blasts GOP candidates: \u201cMoral cowardice should be outright disqualifying in anyone seeking high office\u201d", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2010/01/why_obama_should_not_pick_krugman_for_the_fed-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@scottekaufman", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Scott Eric Kaufman", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com,", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "But if we must talk about character, let\u2019s talk about what matters, namely intellectual integrity.\nBut moral cowardice should be outright disqualifying in anyone seeking high office.\nWe really, really don\u2019t want the job of responding to that crisis dictated by someone who still can\u2019t bring himself to admit that invading Iraq was a disaster but health reform wasn\u2019t.\nI still think this election should turn almost entirely on the issues.\nNever being able to say that you were wrong is a serious character flaw even if the consequences of that refusal to admit error fall only on a few people."}
