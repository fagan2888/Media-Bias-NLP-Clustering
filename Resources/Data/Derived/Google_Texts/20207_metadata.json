Although the Second Circuit saved administrators from the threat of civil penalties when they violate the DOL's regulations on claims procedures, the court also made it harder for them to get a favorable standard of judicial review in such cases.\n\nClaims Procedure Regulations\n\nThe DOL regulations in question set deadlines for responding to benefit claims and require administrators to communicate certain information to the plan participants seeking benefits. According to the Second Circuit, an administrator won't have to pay monetary penalties for violating these regulations, but it will suffer the following consequences:\n\nThe administrator's decision denying benefits will be subject to the more stringent de novo judicial review, unless the administrator can show that it had \u201cestablished procedures in full conformity with the regulation.\u201d The administrator must also show that its failure to follow those procedures was \u201cinadvertent and harmless.\u201d\n\nThe district judge hearing the case may allow the claimant to introduce evidence outside the administrative record, despite the general rule prohibiting such evidence in cases brought under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act.\n\nIn so ruling, the Second Circuit rejected the more plan-friendly \u201csubstantial compliance doctrine\u201d used by other courts. Under that doctrine, a plan administrator won't lose the benefit of deferential judicial review as long as it substantially complied with the DOL regulations.\n\nAccording to the Second Circuit, this doctrine is \u201cflatly inconsistent\u201d with the DOL regulations adopted in 2000. That's because the department \u201cconsidered and rejected\u201d the doctrine in the course of amending its original 1977 regulations, the Second Circuit explained.\n\nOn the issue of civil penalties, the Second Circuit disagreed with the district judge who found that an administrator's violation could be remedied by penalties . The Second Circuit said the regulation itself didn't provide for penalties and that the U.S. Supreme Court has been \u201cparticularly reluctant to recognize such non-statutory remedies in the ERISA context.\u201d\n\nThe Second Circuit said that \u201csome or all\u201d of its analysis in this case could be affected by the Affordable Care Act and the new regulations governing claims procedures issued under the ACA.\n\nAs a result of this ruling, a Connecticut-based federal judge will have to reconsider a dispute between Yale University's health plan and a former graduate student who sought plan benefits without the assistance of a lawyer.\n\nChief Judge Robert A. Katzmann wrote the court's opinion, which was joined by Judge Gerard E. Lynch and District Judge Janet Bond Arterton of the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut.\n\nFormer Yale student Tiffany L. Halo represented herself. Donahue Durham & Noonan PC represented the health plan.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Jacklyn Wille in Washington at jwille@bna.com\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Jo-el J.
