The health care reform law will require companies with 100 or more full-time employees to provide health care coverage for those workers beginning in 2015. Sandra Clark, the company\u2019s director of operations, estimates the law will cost the company about $500,000 per year. The meal surcharge is expected to bring in $160,000 per year. A separate set of Gator\u2019s Dockside restaurants run by a different company will not levy the health care charge.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re definitely doing it to stay afloat,\u201d Clark told WPEC. \u201cIt\u2019s not political in any way.\u201d\n\nGator\u2019s isn\u2019t the first player in the restaurant business to warn that Obamacare will increase costs to consumers; Papa John\u2019s said last year it could lead to pricier pizzas.\n\n[WPEC]", "article_metadata": {"description": "A restaurant chain in Florida is now forcing customers to pay a little extra because of the new health care reform law.
