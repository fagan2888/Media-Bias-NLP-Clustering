The Syrian-based terror group is all sitting around singing, rifles stacked in the middle of the room in a menacing manner and their flag draped on the wall above. As their celebration continues, all of the sudden there’s a massive BOOM and the camera is shot off the screen.

Panic ensues, and the men run around like madmen screaming “Allahu akbar!”

These men are said to be a group of Takfiri terrorists, a foreign-sponsored group that’s claimed responsibility for numerous attacks across Syria, Lebanon, and Iraq.
