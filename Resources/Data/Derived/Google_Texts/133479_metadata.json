This year\u2019s analysis includes rates from 10 insurers, using policies sold in Tennessee, a \u201crepresentative\u201d state, Mr. Slome said. Factors behind the rates include higher claims costs, he said; in 2014, insurers paid out $7.8 billion in claims, an increase of nearly 5 percent.\n\nA healthy 55-year-old man can now expect to pay, on average, $2,075 per year for $164,000 in initial benefits, up from $1,765 last year, the report found.\n\nThe cost for a healthy, single woman of the same age is higher: Her average premium is $2,411, up from $2,307. Insurers take gender into account when pricing long-term care policies, since, statistically, women live longer and are more likely to need long-term care.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLast year, the National Women\u2019s Law Center filed federal sex-discrimination complaints against four insurers, challenging such gender-based pricing on the grounds that the practice violates a provision of the Affordable Care Act barring sex discrimination in health care. The action is pending with the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019s Office for Civil Rights.\n\nCouples generally get a discount if they buy a joint policy; the rationale is that one or the other is likely to provide some care for a spouse initially, Mr. Slome said. A married couple, both age 60, would now pay $3,930 combined, up from $3,840, for $328,000 of initial coverage.\n\nThe numbers assume a \u201cthree-year\u201d policy that uses a daily benefit of $150 to compute a maximum payout, and includes inflation protection \u2014 a 3 percent compounded annual increase in benefits. Eliminating inflation protection greatly reduces the cost \u2014 the average premium for a single man would be cut roughly in half \u2014 but that means you will probably have to pay more out of pocket if you eventually need care. A middle option, which costs more than the base premium, allows the choice of adding inflation protection later.\n\nThe rates cited in the report are for new policies. Premiums for outstanding policies, particularly older ones, have been increasing as well, in part because people are living longer and insurers had underestimated the level of claims.\n\nInsurers generally must get state approval before increasing rates on existing policies. In many cases, however, even with large increases, premiums on older policies are still lower than they would be if the policyholder had waited until now to buy a new policy, said Michael Kitces, director of research at Pinnacle Advisory Group in Columbia, Md.\n\nMr. Kitces said consumers can try to hold down premiums on new policies by making sure that their coverage is tailored as much as possible to their situation. For instance, he advises checking rates for care facilities near your home \u2014 or near a family member\u2019s home, if that\u2019s where you would likely receive it \u2014 to make sure you\u2019re not overpaying for a high daily benefit rate if rates in your area are lower than national averages.\n\nOne way to make premiums more affordable generally, Mr. Kitces said, might be to lengthen plan deductibles, known in industry lingo as the \u201celimination period.\u201d That\u2019s the length of time during which you pay for care out of pocket, before the policy begins paying.\n\nMost plans sold today have a 90-day elimination period. But if the window were significantly lengthened \u2014 say, to two or even three years \u2014 in exchange for expanded benefits afterward to cover events like very long, financially catastrophic nursing home stays \u2014 premiums could be much lower. Policyholders could then use the savings to help fund a deductible.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOne barrier, however, is that most states prohibit elimination periods of longer than one year, Mr. Kitces said \u2014 a consumer protection holdover from a time when people didn\u2019t live as long and plans were less costly.\n\nHere are some questions and answers about long-term care insurance:\n\n\u25a0 When is the best time to buy such insurance?\n\nPremiums typically will be lower if you buy when you are younger \u2014 say, in your 50s \u2014 rather than waiting until your 60s or 70s. Coverage not only becomes more expensive as you age but also becomes more difficult to qualify for at all, since health problems are more likely as you age.\n\n\u25a0 Can I find policies now that offer longer elimination periods?\n\nYou may be able to find a policy with an elimination period of up to a year, but the amount saved with a 12-month deductible, compared with a three-month deductible, may not be significant, Mr. Kitces said.\n\n\u25a0 How can I find the best rate?\n\nMr. Slome advises comparing rates from several insurers, as premiums vary widely. The latest analysis found the difference between the lowest- and highest-cost policies for the same coverage ranged from 34 percent to as much as 119 percent. A 55-year-old woman, for instance, might pay as little as $890 a year or as much as $1,829 for a similar policy without inflation protection, depending on the insurer. An insurance broker can help sort things out, but since some work exclusively with one insurer, you may need to talk to more than one.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20150219200743, "twitter": {"description": "A report by the American Association for Long-Term Care Insurance finds that rates rose this year an average of 9 percent.", "title": "Long-Term Care Insurance: Costs Are Up but Vary Widely", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/21/your-money/long-term-care-insurance-costs-are-up-but-vary-widely.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003522703"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/21/your-money/long-term-care-insurance-costs-are-up-but-vary-widely.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003522703", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/21/your-money/long-term-care-insurance-costs-are-up-but-vary-widely.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "yourmoney", "hdl_p": "Long-Term Care Insurance: Costs Are Up but Vary Widely", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/your-money/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Feb. 19, 2015", "edt": "NewYork", "org": "American Association for Long-Term Care Insurance", "keywords": "Long-Term Care Insurance,American Association for Long-Term Care Insurance", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Ann Carrns", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "byl": "By ANN CARRNS", "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "A report by the American Association for Long-Term Care Insurance finds that rates rose this year an average of 9 percent.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "description": "A report by the American Association for Long-Term Care Insurance finds that rates rose this year an average of 9 percent.", "CG": "your-money", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Feb. 19, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/c/ann_carrns/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/your-money/index.html", "section": "Your Money", "modified": "2015-02-24", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/your-money/index.jsonp", "tag": "American Association for Long-Term Care Insurance", "published": "2015-02-19", "section-taxonomy-id": "ED7B8594-44CE-4D37-A58B-1CDAA19774E4"}, "slug": "21adviser", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20150224014407, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/21/your-money/long-term-care-insurance-costs-are-up-but-vary-widely.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article", "description": "A report by the American Association for Long-Term Care Insurance finds that rates rose this year an average of 9 percent.", "title": "Long-Term Care Insurance: Costs Are Up but Vary Widely"}, "pdate": 20150219, "des": "Long-Term Care Insurance", "articleid": 100000003522703, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Long-Term Care Insurance: Costs Are Up but Vary Widely", "col": "Your Money Adviser", "PST": "News"}, "article_summary": "Insurers take gender into account when pricing long-term care policies, since, statistically, women live longer and are more likely to need long-term care.\nHere are some questions and answers about long-term care insurance:\u25a0 When is the best time to buy such insurance?\nRates for long-term care insurance, which can help pay for care in your own house or in a nursing home, rose this year an average of nearly 9 percent, a new industry report finds.\nMr. Slome advises comparing rates from several insurers, as premiums vary widely.\nThis year\u2019s analysis includes rates from 10 insurers, using policies sold in Tennessee, a \u201crepresentative\u201d state, Mr. Slome said."}
