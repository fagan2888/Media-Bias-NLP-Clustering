Making the most common rattlesnake anti-venom, for instance, involves injecting sheep with snake venom and then harvesting the antibodies produced by the animals\u2019 immune systems. But does that process add up to the estimated $2,300 per vial that hospitals pay for the stuff?\n\nDr. Leslie Boyer wanted to find out. She\u2019s the founding director of the VIPER Institute at the University of Arizona, a research group studying ways to improve the medical treatment of venom injuries. As she writes in an upcoming issue of the American Journal of Medicine, the cost of actually making the anti-venom added up to roughly one tenth of one percent of the total cost. Clinical trials accounted for another 2 percent. Other miscellaneous costs, including licensing fees, wholesaler fees, regulatory, legal and office costs, and profit, added up to 28 percent.\n\nFinally, more than 70 percent of the cost \u2014 responsible for most of the \u201csticker shock\u201d \u2014 comes from hospital markups that are used in negotiations with insurance providers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a markup intended to be discounted back down,\u201d Boyer explained.\n\nBut if you don\u2019t have insurance? The negotiating is all on you. And if you happen to have a high deductible for medications, your payment can add up to thousands.\n\nSetting aside the huge hospital markups, Boyer says there\u2019s a lot going on in the \u201cother\u201d cost category as well.\n\n\u201cThe lion\u2019s share of expected payment on behalf of insured patients was attributable to analysts, attorneys, consultants and business activities that set the U.S. bureaucracy apart from its neighbors,\u201d she writes in the journal.\n\nShe points to the fight between rival rattlesnake anti-venoms currently winding down before the International Trade Commission.\n\n\u201cRather than bringing the price of anti-venom down, competition drove it up, as millions of dollars in legal costs had to be distributed across a few thousand patients,\u201d she writes.\n\nAccording to Boyer\u2019s model, a single vial of anti-venom that would cost over $14,000 in the United States would cost one or two hundred dollars in Mexico. Same medicine. Same manufacturer. But a totally different pharmaceutical market.\n\nIn Mexico, Boyer says, authorities determined some time ago that treating venomous snake and spider bites was a public health issue.\n\n\u201cTheir policy has always been that the government will provide adequate amounts of anti-venom via a massive purchase of the drug which it distributes to health clinics.\u201d\n\nWe could try to implement something similar here, but it would require an act of Congress to do so.\n\n\u2014 Christopher Ingraham, The Washington Post", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2015/09/1003583940-FL_SAR_HFQA15.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcea9c\"", "article_summary": "In Mexico, Boyer says, authorities determined some time ago that treating venomous snake and spider bites was a public health issue.\nA: Every once in a while somebody will go and get themselves bitten by a venomous snake, and come home with an outrageous hospital bill that makes headlines.\nMaking the most common rattlesnake anti-venom, for instance, involves injecting sheep with snake venom and then harvesting the antibodies produced by the animals\u2019 immune systems.\nSetting aside the huge hospital markups, Boyer says there\u2019s a lot going on in the \u201cother\u201d cost category as well.\nOther miscellaneous costs, including licensing fees, wholesaler fees, regulatory, legal and office costs, and profit, added up to 28 percent."}
