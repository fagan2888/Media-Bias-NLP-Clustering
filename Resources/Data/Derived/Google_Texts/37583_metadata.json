I don\u2019t want to go. There are no services there.\u201d\n\nIf Cabrera were a U.S. citizen it would be about time that the Loveland hospital, which saved his life following a catastrophic car crash in December, would transfer him to a nursing home or long-term care facility. After one month of care, the now-stabilized Cabrera, who used to love to dance, is paralyzed from the neck down, tied to a ventilator and will need daily medical attention for the rest of his life. But Cabrera came to the U.S. from Mexico illegally, and unlike a U.S. citizen he does not qualify for any public benefits. Without health insurance or money to pay thousands of dollars up front, no domestic long-term care facility is likely to accept him as a patient.\n\nSo what would normally be a routine discharge from the acute-care hospital to a long-term care facility has turned into a debacle at the crosshairs of two of the most controversial systems in this country \u2014 health care and immigration. The uncertainty of what will happen to Cabrera and where he will be transferred in the next few weeks has left him and his family despondent.\n\nThe ventilator that keeps Cabrera alive hisses in the background now and again, and though he can\u2019t audibly speak, he mouths Spanish words his family reads off his lips. When they struggle to understand, his younger brother Diego pulls out a tablet with the alphabet and patiently sounds out each letter.\n\n\u201cAh. Beh. Ceh\u2026\u201d When he hits the right letter Cabrera clicks his tongue. Ktch. Diego starts over to find the next letter. \u201cAh. Beh. Ceh\u2026\u201d until Cabrera clicks again \u2014 ktch \u2014 painfully slowly communicating his fear that the hospital will deport him to Mexico.\n\n\u201cThey told me I only have one week to know where to go [to another facility in the U.S.] or they will send me to Mexico,\u201d Cabrera says. \u201cThat\u2019s why I am scared. And I want to get better. My son is here.\u201d\n\nCabrera\u2019s seven-year-old son is not a U.S. citizen, he came to the U.S. as a one-year-old because his father was \u201cjust trying to be somebody, to have a life and good things for his family,\u201d says his cousin Jessica Rodriguez. Cabrera crossed the border illegally with his now ex-wife and their baby.\n\nWhile U.S. hospitals are required to admit any patient in need of emergency care, their obligation and financial reimbursement for an uninsured patient ends when the patient is stabilized. Typically, patients in Cabrera\u2019s condition would be moved to long-term care facilities as soon as they were in a stable condition. But unlike hospitals, rehabilitation centers and nursing homes are under no federal mandate to accept uninsured patients. So they take advantage of the opportunity to refuse.\n\n\u201cIf you send him to Mexico he will die,\u201d Rodriguez says. \u201cNo ands, if or buts about it. I know how hospitals work in Mexico. There are no regulations like here. They are not going to give him the same care, especially if we don\u2019t have money for a private hospital.\u201d\n\nKnown as medical repatriation, the international transfer of undocumented patients like Cabrera is quietly practiced by U.S. hospitals nationwide. Hundreds if not thousands of immigrants have been shipped back mostly to Mexico, Central and South America, oftentimes to grossly inadequate medical care that leaves patients debilitated or dead. All this happens without the involvement of any branch of the federal government, including immigration.\n\nIn fact, no federal agency oversees the practice and hospitals are not required to report or track medical deportations, making it impossible to know the number of patients that have been medically deported and leaving room for mistakes and corruption that only a small number of journalists and immigrant advocates have documented: one hospital attempted to repatriate a two-day-old U.S. citizen born to immigrant parents; a Phoenix hospital attempted to repatriate a legal immigrant mother of seven U.S.-born children back to Honduras; a Florida hospital repatriated a Guatemalan national with severe head trauma to a rehabilitation facility that operated on a $400,000 annual budget \u2014 the Guatemalan hospital kept the patient for two weeks before discharging him to his elderly mother\u2019s home (because they \u201cneeded the bed\u201d), where he received no medical treatment for years and suffered violent seizures, vomited blood and frequently fell unconscious, according to a 2008 New York Times report.\n\n\u201cThis is the result of having a health care system based on free market values,\u201d says Longmont Immigration Attorney Ian McKinley. \u201cI wish health care reform would have instituted socialized medicine so everyone would have access to health care. But in order to change that you\u2019d have to go back and re-pass health care reform and obviously that\u2019s not going to happen. Look at the fight in this country just over the changes that were made. It\u2019s the health care system that is to blame here because it allows hospitals to treat people based on whether or not they can pay.\u201d\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nAfter receiving word of her son\u2019s accident, Cabrera\u2019s mother, Gabriela, came to the U.S. in December on a humanitarian visa. Gabriela worries that because she has no money, Cabrera will be worse off in Mexico.\n\n\u201cIn Mexico right now it\u2019s really rough,\u201d she says through an interpreter. \u201cThere is nothing really. I am a single mom. I don\u2019t have a husband. So right now I am having it rough. In Mexico there is no work, no money.\u201d\n\nShe previously worked in a factory cleaning and packing potatoes, or did cleaning jobs, but says she has been unemployed for the last six months. She says that causes her to worry that she will not be able to pay for the care that Cabrera will need in Mexico, the care that she worries he will only be able to get at a costly private hospital.\n\nAccording to his family, the Medical Center of the Rockies has said they will transfer Cabrera to a Mexican facility with or without his consent.\n\nBoulder Weekly contacted Medical Center of the Rockies, but spokesperson Kelly Tracer said the hospital had no comment.\n\nA spokesperson for the larger University of Colorado Health system also said it could not comment, citing patient privacy. Even commenting on the practice of medical repatriation in Colorado might breach patient privacy, said Dan Weaver, the UC Health media relations director.\n\nGabriela says the pressure the hospital is putting on her to find a solution makes her anxious.\n\n\u201cI feel like they are pressing me to make a decision,\u201d she says. \u201cIn yesterday\u2019s meeting [ Jan. 14] they said, \u2018You have got to find somewhere to put him or he is going to Mexico.\u2019 He [Cabrera] gets really anxious, really nervous. Doctors tell me they have done all they can for him, that he is always going to be on a respirator, obviously, but doesn\u2019t need to be in hospital, that I need to find somewhere to put him. If not, then [going to Mexico] is the consequence. They have not told me to reach out to this person or that person for help. It\u2019s just either I figure it out or else.\u201d\n\nIn response to newspaper reports on medical deportation, the American Medical Association Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs released a statement in 2009 advising hospitals not to repatriate without the patient\u2019s or guardian\u2019s consent.\n\n\u201cAssist a patient who is unwilling to accept the discharge plan to seek independent ethics consultation or other means of resolving ongoing disagreement,\u201d the statement advised. \u201cAnd refrain from signing a discharge order that would result in an involuntary discharge of a patient who is not a U.S. citizen.\u201d\n\nColorado Hospital Association spokesman Kevin Downey says that while such a statement is admirable, it might not be enforceable or applicable to all hospital systems.\n\n\u201cThat recommendation comes from a well-intended place, but what are hospitals supposed to do then?\u201d he asks. \u201cAre they supposed to continue to care for a patient that has exorbitant costs and no one there to pay for it when there are patients lining up who need that bed? This is not a problem that can be solved by hospitals engaging differently. This particular group was left out of the Affordable Care Act, and that\u2019s virtually the only group not protected in the ACA. This is a public policy and social issue that was not addressed and it\u2019s beyond the sole ability of hospitals to solve. There needs to be enough parties coming together so patients can have all of their other options exhausted before they are asked to get up and move to their country of origin. Obviously, there seems to be incredible roles for states and incredible roles for the federal government as relates to this. It would be wonderful if there were other ways to get this sorted out without hospitals having to do it trial by fire.\u201d\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nA Chicago hospital that deported a Mexican national in 2011 came under fire after the patient, Quelino Ojeda Jimenez, was transferred to a Mexican hospital where he died in 2012 after he suffered cardiac arrest, developed bedsores, septic infection and ultimately died of pneumonia and other complications. According to the Chicago Tribune, advocates for Ojeda said they believed he might not have died had he remained in the U.S. and the Tribune called the hospital to which he was transferred \u201cill-equipped to handle his needs.\u201d\n\nThe lack of oversight of these types of international transfers is unsettling, McKinley says.\n\n\u201cSome federal entity should be overseeing this,\u201d he says.\n\nThe problem is not particular to any one hospital, it\u2019s systemic. How can it be possible that a hospital should be required to admit everyone, stabilize them, but then nursing homes aren\u2019t under the same statute and can simply refuse patients who can\u2019t pay, leaving hospitals with a patient they cannot discharge and for whose care they are not reimbursed?\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a relatively easy solution to this,\u201d says Joseph Ramos a medical doctor and a Denver-based attorney. \u201cThat is for the federal government to say, \u2018Look, just like we provide funding through Medicaid for emergency care to hospitals for people who don\u2019t have health insurance or don\u2019t have money, we\u2019re also going to provide for the ongoing care after that emergency treatment.\u2019 That would probably put an end to this.\u201d\n\nBut is that likely to happen?\n\nDowney doesn\u2019t think so.\n\n\u201cJust judging by the political landscape nationally, there doesn\u2019t seem to be much of an appetite politically to do what is necessary for this [immigrant] population it terms of offering them protection and things like that,\u201d Downey says. \u201cThere needs to be a national conversation and until that happens, hospitals are being forced to make these unique decisions based on the information they have at the time.\u201d\n\nSo far, legal repercussions for medically deporting patients against their will is mostly untouched territory. Medical repatriation circumvents the deportation process entirely.\n\nMost patients facing these situations are poor, and once they are sent back to their native country the likelihood for them to pursue legal action is minuscule.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why hospitals can get away with this,\u201d McKinley says. \u201cIt\u2019s a legal gray area.\u201d\n\nLegal action in Cabrera\u2019s case, McKinley says, is unlikely. He doesn\u2019t have U.S.-born children, he hasn\u2019t been in the U.S. that long and according to the police report he was driving under the influence of alcohol and sustained a single-car accident when he ran into a tree fleeing the police.\n\nMarta Moreno is the executive director of El Comit\u00e9 de Longmont, an immigrant advocate organization, and says she hopes that Medical Center of the Rockies is recommending Cabrera be sent to Mexico truly because they exhausted all other options and because it will be best for him, not just to save money. She says the anti-immigrant will argue Cabrera was here illegally and illegal immigrants don\u2019t pay taxes and don\u2019t deserve public benefits, but she asserts that is a false assumption.\n\n\u201cWe have an immigrant population that has contributed a lot, and they pay a lot of taxes and they don\u2019t get that back,\u201d she says.\n\nAccording to a 2013 study published in Health Affairs journal, immigrants contribute billions to Medicare because employers give them fake social security numbers, but they rarely see any of the benefits. Between 2002 and 2009, immigrants contributed $115 billion more to the Medicare program than they drew out. Meanwhile, U.S. citizens draw more from the Medicare program than they contribute \u2014 running a deficit of $30.9 billion.\n\nMcKinley says that even though Cabrera\u2019s case makes it extremely difficult to pursue legal action, it makes him sick to think the health care system here can just cut him off.\n\n\u201cIf I could have it my way we would be a society that recognized some people are going to fall into extremely bad situations and we\u2019ll be there to help out,\u201d he says. \u201cBut that\u2019s obviously not the country we live in. Nobody is going to help him here.\u201d\n\nRodriguez, Cabrera\u2019s cousin, is a U.S. citizen and says she is disappointed in her country.\n\n\u201cThe doctor who talked to us yesterday said they checked with Craig Hospital in Denver [to see if he could be transferred there] and they basically said, \u2018No money, no service,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cI told him this is so unfair because if you\u2019re an immigrant or non-status person with no insurance and no money then that means you have no right to any therapy? And he basically said that\u2019s what it boils down to. He was straightforward, like it is what it is. I am very disillusioned with my own country. I thought this country would always say it is all about family, and I don\u2019t see how they could be so\u2026 just raw and rude and say, \u2018If you don\u2019t have money and you\u2019re not from here, well then it sucks for you.\u2019\u201d\n\n* The names of some sources in this article were changed upon request to protect their identity.\n\nRespond: letters@boulderweekly.com", "article_metadata": {"generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "Cassie Moore", "og": {"site_name": "Boulder Weekly", "description": "I am afraid,\u201d says Roman Cabrera, lying tiltedup in a hospital bed at the Medical Center of the Rockies in Loveland, his neck swallowed in braces. \u201cI am very scared they will send me to Mexico.
