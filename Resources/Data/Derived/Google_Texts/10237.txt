Tampa Bay residents with Humana health insurance plans won't have to find new hospitals after all.

The insurance company had notified its 1.5 million Florida customers that the contract with Hospital Corporation of America was expiring, meaning HCA hospitals would no longer be "in-network."

But the two companies reached consensus on a new two-year contract, Humana announced late Thursday.

The agreement will enable members with Medicare, Medi­caid and commercial plans to continue receiving in-network services at HCA hospitals. It also applies to CarePlus health plans.

HCA is one of the nation's largest health care providers. The for-profit company boasts 22 hospitals and surgery centers in the Tampa Bay area.

Earlier in the week, Humana announced a new agreement with the Florida Hospital system.

Starting Aug. 1, Humana customers with individual health plans — including those offered on the Affordable Care Act exchange — will be able to receive in-network care at Florida Hospital facilities in the Tampa Bay area.

"Our mission is to continue to provide accessible, affordable care to our communities," said Mike Schultz, president and CEO of Florida Hospital West Florida Region. "This new agreement with Humana allows us to continue meeting the health care needs of the community."

Members with Medicare and commercial plans already had access to Florida Hospital facilities, the insurance company said.
