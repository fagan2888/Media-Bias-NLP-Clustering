Last season in the minor leagues, Gray pitched 124 innings. This season he increased to 155 between Triple-A and the major leagues. The Rockies called him up Aug. 4.\n\n\u201cIt was pretty black and white,\u201d Weiss said.\n\nGray\u2019s poor outing Monday against the Pirates did not factor into the Rockies\u2019 decision to end his season, Weiss said.\n\n\u201cIt was never a thought,\u201d he said.\n\nWATCH: What\u2019s your advice for Colorado Rockies\u2019 Jon Gray?\n\nAgainst the Pirates, Gray gave up two home runs in the first inning, then five runs on nine hits over 4 1/3 innings. He has struggled at Coors Field this season.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve pitched fine on the road,\u201d Gray said. \u201cI just can\u2019t find that \u2014 whatever it is \u2014 to make an adjustment to pitch in this place.\u201d\n\nGray compiled an 8.27 ERA at home, compared to 2.70 on the road.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been difficult for me, especially when you come from a road start and you come here,\u201d Gray said. \u201cYou can\u2019t start pitches where you used to.\n\nGray finished his debut season 0-2 with a 5.53 ERA in nine starts.\n\nThe Rockies\u2019 plan for him in 2016 is to throw a complete season.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll still work on mechanics over the last couple weeks,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cAnd he\u2019ll have a typical offseason. He should be built up and ready to go for a full season next year.\u201d\n\nDe La Rosa aggravated a right Achilles tendinitis injury last week at Los Angeles. He was pulled from his turn in the rotation Wednesday and replaced by Christian Bergman, but the Rockies won\u2019t try to bring him back next week.\n\nThe 34-year-old was also hampered by a groin injury and a finger blister on his pitching hand this season.\n\nThe Rockies now have a five-man rotation that includes Bergman, Chad Bettis, David Hale, Kyle Kendrick and Chris Rusin. Yohan Flande (knee bruise) was replaced by Hale for Friday\u2019s start, but he still might pitch next week, Weiss said.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Jon Gray, Jorge De La Rosa shut down for the season with Rockies", "title": "Jon Gray, Jorge De La Rosa shut down for the season with Rockies", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/09/23/jon-gray-jorge-de-la-rosa-shut-down-for-the-season-with-rockies/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150923_035202_jon-gray-1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150923_035202_jon-gray-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-23T16:16:47+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T23:18:01+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0f42\"", "article_summary": "The Rockies on Wednesday shut down rookie right-hander Jon Gray and veteran lefty Jorge De La Rosa for the season, manager Walt Weiss said.\nGray\u2019s poor outing Monday against the Pirates did not factor into the Rockies\u2019 decision to end his season, Weiss said.\nYohan Flande (knee bruise) was replaced by Hale for Friday\u2019s start, but he still might pitch next week, Weiss said.\nWATCH: What\u2019s your advice for Colorado Rockies\u2019 Jon Gray?\nLast season in the minor leagues, Gray pitched 124 innings."}
