Richard Codey (D-Essex), who was there to help serve meals. \u201cWhat better way to show how much we care for these men and women and to let them know they are not forgotten or alone, than to join them on Christmas to bring them a little joy during the holidays.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, dozens of people were lined up outside the door to receive trays full of steak, mashed potatoes and green beans \u2014 and, for dessert, pumpkin and blueberry pie and chocolate cake. Ornaments decorated tables and one woman wore a red cloak and pom-pom-topped Santa hat. Christmas carols filled the air.\n\n\u201cOne woman was crying and she said, \u2018I never thought I\u2019d be as happy on Christmas,\u2019\u201d Codey said.\n\nGifts, including hats, coats and toiletries were given out with help from Spread the Purple, a charitable organization that provides resources for those in need.\n\nSunrise Care serves 110 men and women, including veterans, and provides a variety of pre-vocational classes as well as life skills instruction. Many of the center\u2019s clients come from local shelters and boarding homes.\n\nFor Codey, who attended the Sunrise Care Christmas with his son Kevin, the event coincided with the recent creation of the Codey Fund for Mental Health. Launched in late November with $200,000 in private donations, the foundation supports programs for the homeless and severely mentally ill.\n\nWhen the fund was announced, Codey spoke of hoping to end the stigma associated with mental illness. His wife, Mary Jo Codey, suffered from postpartum depression.\n\n\u201cOur primary aim is to end the stigma associated with mental illness,\u201d Codey said. \u201cIt affects more people on a daily basis than cancer or heart disease\u2026it\u2019s an epidemic.\u201d\n\nHis wife, Mary Jo Codey, has suffered from postpartum depression.\n\nAccording to the National Alliance on Mental Illness, about 260,000 adult New Jersey residents live with severe mental health conditions.\n\nIn addition to the former governor of New Jersey, 12 volunteers arrived to make Christmas merry at Sunrise Care.\n\nJack Krafjack, a member of the Bound Brook Elks, said volunteering at Sunrise Care was the true meaning of Christmas.\n\n\u201cYou reach a time in your life when it is about helping others,\u201d said Krafjack, who served lunch and dessert.\n\n\u201cMy mom suffers from mental illness so today is really special for me,\u201d said Liz Sorensen, a Bound Brook resident who volunteered with her husband, Bob.\n\nMohammed Naeem, the Founder of Sunrise Care, joined Chef Rashun Brown in the kitchen to prepare the meal.\n\n\u201cWe are here to serve those who are less fortunate with dignity,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "'@river','@starledger','essex-county'", "title": "Former Gov.
