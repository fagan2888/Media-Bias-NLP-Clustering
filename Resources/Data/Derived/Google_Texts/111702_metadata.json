The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services revealed the mistake last week.\n\nMore than 85 percent of the newly insured under the Affordable Care Act qualify for a subsidy from the government to help pay for coverage.\n\nBut taxpayers have to reconcile the tax credits they got during the year because they were based on estimated income data. Any variations from those estimates or changes in life status \u2014 a marriage, or a salary raise, means the subsidies will likely change for some.\n\nThe headache for taxpayers \u2014 and the political one for the White House \u2014 comes as the IRS role in implementing the law becomes more apparent. The agency determines the accuracy of the subsidies and will be assessing tax penalties if those who didn\u2019t qualify for an exemption failed to get insured.\n\nSenate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) sent a letter on Monday to CMS Administrator Marilyn Tavenner and IRS Commissioner John Koskinen requesting details of how the glitch occurred. Hatch asked Koskinen to confirm if he agrees with estimates that about 50,000 people have already filed their taxes using the incorrect information and asked him to clarify the procedures for those who must refile due to the mistake.\n\nThe Treasury move didn\u2019t satisfy Hatch\u2019s request.\n\n\u201cThis is yet another example of the administration covering their tracks to avoid the political fallout of mistakes made in executing their own law,\u201d he said in an emailed statement. \u201cUnilateral action such as this deserves further scrutiny by Congress.\u201d\n\nThe Finance Committee is planning an oversight hearing in the near future that will touch on this issue.\n\nTreasury said that taxpayers are likely to benefit from filing amended returns if their original form lists a benchmark premium of $100 and the updated form lists a premium of $200.\n\nCMS last week wouldn\u2019t comment on the specific component of HealthCare.gov that\u2019s supposed to generate the tax forms. The agency did say that the system used 2015 insurance information when it should have used 2014 for the tax forms. But it\u2019s only the forms that were wrong; the system calculated the actual subsidies correctly.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The glitch caused about 800,000 Americans to receive erroneous tax forms.", "title": "IRS won't collect on bad returns from Obamacare glitch", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/02/irs-wont-collect-on-bad-returns-from-obamacare-glitch-115470.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/02/24/150224_irs_bldg_gty_629.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Obamacare,Money,Health Care,Treasury Department,Subsidies,Politics,IRS", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "The glitch caused about 800,000 Americans to receive erroneous tax forms.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "POLITICO Pro IRS won't collect on bad returns from Obamacare glitchThe Obama administration took a step on Tuesday toward containing the damage from sending the wrong Obamacare tax data to hundreds of thousands of taxpayers.\nThe 50,000 taxpayers who filed returns based on inaccurate subsidy data they got from the government will not need to file amended returns and the IRS won\u2019t collect for any underpayment, the Treasury Department said.\nCMS last week wouldn\u2019t comment on the specific component of HealthCare.gov that\u2019s supposed to generate the tax forms.\nThe agency did say that the system used 2015 insurance information when it should have used 2014 for the tax forms.\n\u201cIndividuals may want to consult with their tax preparers to determine if they would benefit from filing amended returns,\u201d a Treasury representative said in an email."}
