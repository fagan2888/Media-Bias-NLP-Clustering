Staggers, M.D., M.P.H., chair of the Foundation\u2019s Board of Directors. Belk is currently senior vice president of Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors, a position she has held since 2002.\n\n\u201cJudy has stellar operational and strategic leadership expertise in philanthropy and a strong sense of valuing the voices of grantees,\u201d Staggers said. \u201cThis coupled with her track record in myriad philanthropic efforts that support underserved communities makes her a strong match for The California Wellness Foundation.\u201d\n\nA seasoned leader with more than 25 years of senior management experience in the philanthropic, government, nonprofit and corporate sectors, Belk played a pivotal role in building Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors (RPA) into one of the nation\u2019s largest independent nonprofit advisory firms, which currently advises on more than $300 million annually in more than 30 countries.\n\nShe launched the firm\u2019s West Coast and Midwest operations and helped position RPA as a global \u201cthought leader\u201d in promoting effective strategic philanthropy, impact investing, and diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. Previously, Belk served as vice president of global public affairs at Levi Strauss & Co., reporting directly to the chairman and CEO, with responsibilities for both the company\u2019s and foundation\u2019s leadership in the global fight against AIDS, as well as their economic development, environmental and antiracism initiatives.\n\n\u201cI am proud to join the Foundation and support its mission to promote a healthier California,\u201d Belk said. \u201cSince its founding, TCWF has played a historic role in courageously funding in public health areas that had drawn little or no philanthropic attention.\u201d\n\nBelk said that, in the process, the Foundation has expanded the definition of health and wellness for all Californians, particularly underserved, diverse communities.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to working with TCWF\u2019s impressive Board, its talented staff and committed community partners across the state in leveraging the Foundation\u2019s resources and voice in bringing about meaningful health changes,\u201d she said.\n\nEugene Washington, M.D., vice chair of TCWF\u2019s Board, believes Belk\u2019s vast philanthropic expertise will add valuable insight to the Foundation\u2019s current and future grantmaking programs, especially as they relate to health coverage.\n\n\u201cWith the expansion of health coverage under the Affordable Care Act, it is an important time in California and the nation,\u201d Washington said. \u201cI look forward to working with Judy on this vital issue and others that are affecting the health of the people of California.\u201d\n\nThe Foundation is recognized nationally for its strategic core operating support that builds and sustains the capacity of health and human-service nonprofit organizations, and for its public policy grantmaking. TCWF has also earned national recognition for funding public education and policy outreach, including groundbreaking, multilingual campaigns in violence prevention, teenage pregnancy prevention and promoting diversity in the health professions.\n\nBelk will bring to the Foundation a strong track record of leadership spanning the nonprofit, government and corporate sectors. At Levi Strauss & Co., she led a global team in pioneering work on AIDS education and prevention, and women\u2019s economic development, and launched Project Change, a national antiracism initiative, which was recognized by President Bill Clinton with the first Ron Brown Award for Corporate Leadership in 1998. She also developed and led the company\u2019s philanthropic efforts in postapartheid South Africa.\n\nThroughout her career, Belk has been a strong advocate in promoting diversity, inclusion and equity both within and outside of the philanthropic sector. She has been a passionate voice in raising awareness of the needs of women and girls, as well as communities of color. She has been actively involved in the D5 Initiative, a national coalition of philanthropic leaders committed to increasing philanthropic resources for women, for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer, and people of color.\n\n\u201cThe Foundation is at a key crossroads in its history,\u201d said Cole Wilbur, TCWF\u2019s interim president and CEO. \u201cAs we sunset the Responsive Grantmaking Program, the Foundation welcomes Judy, an enterprising leader with deep knowledge in philanthropy, to lead the next era of our grantmaking.\u201d\n\nBelk joins a distinguished roster of executives who have led the Foundation since it was founded more than two decades ago.\n\nBelk is a frequent writer and speaker on organizational ethics, race and social change, and her work has been recognized with several state and national awards. Her pieces have aired on National Public Radio and appeared in the New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, the Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post.\n\nShe currently serves on the boards of the Surdna Foundation, a national New York-based family foundation, and the Marlborough School, a Los Angeles-based, independent school for girls. Past board service includes Southern California Grantmakers, Northern California Grantmakers, National Center on Family Philanthropy, the Ms. Foundation for Women, the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California, the Berkeley Repertory Theatre, and the Independent Sector.\n\nBelk received her undergraduate degree from Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., and her master\u2019s degree in public administration from California State University, East Bay, where she was recognized as the 1999 Distinguished Alumnus of the Year.\n\nBelk has lived and worked in California for her entire professional career. A current resident of Los Angeles, she is a native of Alexandria, Virginia, where she was recently inducted into the Alexandria African American Hall of Fame. She is married to Roger Peeks, M.D., who currently serves as medical director of Valley Community Clinic in North Hollywood. They have two young adult children.\n\nAssisting the Foundation\u2019s Board of Directors in the search for the next president and CEO was Isaacson, Miller, an executive search firm with offices in San Francisco, Boston and Washington, D.C.\n\nThe California Wellness Foundation is a private independent foundation created in 1992 with a mission to improve the health of the people of California by making grants for health promotion, wellness education and disease prevention.\n\nOne of the largest health grantmaking organizations in California, TCWF was established in 1992 as part of the conversion of Health Net from not-for-profit to for-profit status. It is completely separate from Health Net and operates as a private independent foundation. The Foundation headquarters are located in Woodland Hills with a small branch office in San Francisco. Since its founding, TCWF has awarded 7,338 grants totaling more than $890 million.\n\nsource:\n\nMs. Jade A. Stevens\n\nMr. Kim L.
