IONIA, Mich. (AP) - A 63-year-old man who is jailed in Michigan says his time behind bars helped him shed a lot of extra weight.

The Sentinel-Standard of Ionia reports (http://bit.ly/1WfeXvo ) Richard Mutschler of Belding was sentenced to probation with credit for 159 days served in the Ionia County Jail for stealing a toolbox. He’s still serving a sentence that started in July on another charge.

Mutschler says he dropped 130 pounds while in custody. Despite that, he says he anticipates that he’ll still need heart bypass surgery when he’s released.

Mutschler says jail “has been good” and he plans to live a healthier lifestyle on the outside.

Ionia County Circuit Court Judge Suzanne Kreeger says Mutschler’s health improvement is positive and he’s certainly in better shape than when he arrived.
