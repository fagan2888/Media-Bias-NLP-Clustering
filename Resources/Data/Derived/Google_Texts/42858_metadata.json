More confectioners purchase chocolate to make their goods, but Dan Bieser of Tabal starts with cacao beans.\n\nHe imports already-fermented beans from a half-dozen countries, but the bars he makes are from a single source.\n\n\"A good fermentation can bring out the natural flavor in the bean,\" Bieser said.\n\nHe roasts the beans, then cracks and winnows the skin from them with a machine he created.\n\nWhat's left are the cacao nibs. Nibs are half-butter, Bieser said; that butter with tiny bits of cacao in it is called chocolate liquor.\n\nIt's combined with more cacao butter, sugar and vanilla in a stone grinder \u2014 made of granite \u2014 and ground for two to three days, nonstop.\n\n\"It just gets super-rich and thick and dark,\" Bieser said.\n\nNext the mixture goes into a tempering machine, and the temperature is raised, lowered and raised again. Tempering forms the uniform fat and sugar crystals that make a smooth, solid chocolate.\n\nFrom there, Bieser pours the chocolate into 3-ounce bar molds by hand.\n\nOnce cool, it's packaged \u2014 again all by hand \u2014 and is ready for distribution.\n\nGood chocolate, Bieser said, melts easily in the mouth and has a good, strong snap to it.\n\nWith bars made from a single source of chocolate, consumers can taste the differences among beans from different countries. A person might ask him after tasting one, \"Did you put cherry in this?\"\n\n\"No, I didn't,\" he'll say. \"It's the natural flavor of the bean.\"\n\n\"I love that,\" Bieser said.", "article_metadata": {"title": "Producing high-quality chocolates requires good ingredients and time", "og": {"url": "http://www.jsonline.com/business/producing-high-quality-chocolates-requires-good-ingredients-and-time-b99127753z1-230343981.html", "image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/js-for-social-200-final.jpg", "height": 200}, "type": "article", "description": "Dan Bieser imports already-fermented cacao beans from a half-dozen countries and then makes chocolate bars from a single source.", "title": "High-quality chocolates require good ingredients, time"}, "twitter": {"site": "@journalsentinel", "image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/js-for-social-200-final.jpg", "description": "Dan Bieser imports already-fermented cacao beans from a half-dozen countries and then makes chocolate bars from a single source.", "card": "summary", "title": "Producing high-quality chocolates requires good ingredients and time"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"admins": "journal.sentinel.1", "app_id": 227386193957280}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-mjs-144-icon.png", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb3c1\"", "article_summary": "Good chocolate, Bieser said, melts easily in the mouth and has a good, strong snap to it.\nMore confectioners purchase chocolate to make their goods, but Dan Bieser of Tabal starts with cacao beans.\nWhat's left are the cacao nibs.\n\"A good fermentation can bring out the natural flavor in the bean,\" Bieser said.\nNibs are half-butter, Bieser said; that butter with tiny bits of cacao in it is called chocolate liquor."}
