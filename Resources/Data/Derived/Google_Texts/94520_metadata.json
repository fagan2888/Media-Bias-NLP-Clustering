Centerpoint Medical Center in Independence had the third highest score among Missouri hospitals, at 8.65. Menorah Medical Center in Overland Park (8.375), Research Medical Center in Kansas City, Mo., (8.025), and Lee's Summit Medical Center (7.9) also face the Medicare penalty. Belton Regional Medical Center (3) will not and HCA Midwest's other three facilities \u2014 Research Medical Center Brookside, Research Psychiatric Center and Lafayette Regional Health Center \u2014 were not scored.\n\nHCA Midwest officials declined to say how the Medicare penalties would affect the company financially.\n\nHamele's comments about the limitations of the federal metrics echoed those of officials from academic medical centers, which were hit particularly hard by the penalties. Some complained that the metrics penalize hospitals that treat the most fragile patients or are most diligent about reporting their hospital-acquired conditions.\n\nShalan Stroud, a critical care clinical nurse specialist who leads Shawnee Mission Medical Center's initiative to reduce such conditions, said underreporting was not a factor in her facility acquiring a score of 2 \u2014 the lowest in the Kansas City metro area.\n\n\u201cWe report everything,\" Stroud said. \"We report more than even what we have to report because we want to know how we\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nStroud said Shawnee Mission Medical Center has been working with the Kansas Health Care Collaborative, a nonprofit dedicated to improving patient care, as well as the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Healthcare Safety Network on programs to help curb hospital-acquired ailments.\n\nStroud said the hospital's parent company, Adventist Health System, has given financial backing to help make the programs a success. Of the 49 Adventist hospitals nationwide that were part of the federal scoring, 10 were penalized.\n\n\u201cThey are very focused on helping in any way they can and providing us the resources we need to be able to prevent (hospital acquired conditions),\u201d Stroud said.\n\nAndy Marso is a reporter for KHI News Service in Topeka, a partner in the Heartland Health Monitor team.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health", "description": "A spokeswoman for Kansas City's largest hospital system defended its record on patient safety following a report last month that more than half its", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://kcur.org/post/kansas-city-hospital-system-defends-record-medicare-cuts-loom", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/kcur/files/201512/450px_fullcolorKCUR.png", "type": "article", "description": "A spokeswoman for Kansas City's largest hospital system defended its record on patient safety following a report last month that more than half its", "title": "Kansas City Hospital System Defends Record As Medicare Cuts Loom"}, "story_id": 375201897, "twitter": {"site": "@kcur", "card": "summary", "creator": "@kcur"}, "author": "Andy Marso", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Kansas City Hospital System Defends Record As Medicare Cuts Loom"}, "nid": 66975, "datePublished": "2015-01-05", "keywords": "HCA Midwest, Heartland Health Monitor, digital post", "wordCount": 642, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf887\"", "article_summary": "Menorah Medical Center in Overland Park (8.375), Research Medical Center in Kansas City, Mo., (8.025), and Lee's Summit Medical Center (7.9) also face the Medicare penalty.\nBelton Regional Medical Center (3) will not and HCA Midwest's other three facilities \u2014 Research Medical Center Brookside, Research Psychiatric Center and Lafayette Regional Health Center \u2014 were not scored.\nAmong HCA Midwest's hospitals, Overland Park Regional Medical Center scored a 9.025 \u2014 the highest of any hospital in Kansas.\nThe new federal metrics score hospitals on a 10-point scale, with 10 indicating higher incidences of hospital acquired conditions.\nCenterpoint Medical Center in Independence had the third highest score among Missouri hospitals, at 8.65."}
