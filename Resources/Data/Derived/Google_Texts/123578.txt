Athens – A University of Georgia student faces sanctions from the school’s student judiciary board after he was arrested in Atlanta for protesting on the steps of the state Capitol.

Adam Veale, a 20-year-old political science major, said in an interview he was stunned to learn he faced two violations from UGA’s Office of Student Conduct after the March 2 arrest in Atlanta.

He was offered a deal with the school that would have included 16 hours of community service and lunches with faculty members, but turned it down. Instead, he said, he’ll take his chances with a hearing before a judiciary panel on April 24.

“I was unsatisfied with that offer. We weren’t being reckless. This was an act of symbolic speech,” said Veale. “We were saying we’re not going to stand idly by while the governor and the Legislature refuses to expand Medicaid.”

You won’t be hearing the last of this. State Sen. Vincent Fort, D-Atlanta, plans to testify on Veale’s behalf next week at the Athens hearing.
