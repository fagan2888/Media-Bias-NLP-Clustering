HayekWith the official launching of Obamacare on Oct. 1st, I am reminded of the famous aphorism attributed to playwright George Bernard Show, \"The more things change, the more they stay the same.\" Have we learned nothing from history?Who is the real father of universal healthcare? Otto von Bismarck, the Chancellor of Germany (1871-90), established the world's first welfare state in Germany. In 1883, Bismarck established socialized healthcare in Germany with theor Reich Insurance Act which was limited to government bureaucrats and the elderly. Bismarck's institution of socialized healthcare was designed to co-opt the increasing popularity of Marxist socialism and to implement its anti-God, anti-capitalism ideas spreading throughout Europe in the late 1800\u00a1\u00e4s.Because the academy and the media is dominated by the Left most of whom hold to a socialist, progressive or postmodern worldview, much of the history you may have read about the Marxist/Nazi roots of universal healthcare has been rewritten to obscure any reference to these inconvenient historical facts. Modeling his government in part after the dictatorship of his predecessor, Otto von Bismarck, it was Adolf Hitler (1933-45) who actually forced socialized healthcare on the entire German people as a part of a comprehensive, systematic nazification of the German nation including its healthcare industry. For this cause, Adolf Hitler must be considered one of the founding fathers of universal healthcare, along with the Soviet Union who had by 1921 established a universal healthcare system.One aspect of Hitler's socialist universal healthcare model was \"racial hygiene,\" the removal of certain \"undesirable\" segments of society who are judged beneath the Aryan ideal, thus \"life unworthy of existence,\" as Hitler believed. Using his brutal panzer divisions, Hitler literally rolled out his universal healthcare throughout occupied France, Belgium and the Netherlands \u2013 those nations with mainly \"Aryan\" populations. Hitler used his military thugs the Gestapo and SS Stormtroopers, to implement universal healthcare in those very countries that he desired to aryanize and perfect by sanitizing the populations through sterilization and medical murder of all persons unfortunate to have physical or mental defects.Of course I do not contend that Obama is Hitler, but if America foolishly adopt policies of national socialism then we fail to learn from history the innumerable grotesqueries, inhumanity and genocide of previous nations who tried universal healthcare. To grant governments this god-like power over birth, life and death issues will be misused, perhaps not exactly as it was in Nazi Germany yet these antecedents were merely harbingers of our present enslavement under Obamacare. No government should be allowed to collectivize that much power over the people. Friedrich A. Hayek, author of the famous book, \"The Road to Serfdom,\" warned that the crimes of the Nazis were so totalizing in our memory that it blinds us from understanding comparable trends in our own society.Years before the Jews were sent to the death camps en masse, the initial mass murders of the Holocaust were performed in sanitized German hospitals and the clinical procedures for socialized governmental mass execution were created and developed there under the Nazis Aktion T4 Program. Handicapped, retarded and mentally ill persons were euthanized by the hundreds of thousands within Hitler's universal healthcare system including some of Hitler's own relatives. This genocide was conducted not because of evil intent but born out of medical necessity. Hitler, in his official directives allowing medical killing, called them \"mercy killing\" and \"lives not worth living.\" The perverse logic of the Nazis was that by killing these undesirables Germany would not only save these wretched individuals from years of needless suffering, but remove the taxpayers the financial burden to care for these people. Also, the German medical system would be used only on behalf of the fit and the strong. (Here, Hitler's implemented into policy Darwin's natural selection and survival of the fittest ideas). Ironically, due to rumors of the killings of existing patients, many truly ill persons died prematurely because they were too afraid to check into the hospitals under Nazi rule for fear they would never come out alive.The entire Holocaust can be viewed as the triumph of \"Hitlercare.\" In his noted academic study, \"The Nazi Doctors,\" Professor Robert Jay Lifton, explains that the murder of people by the State (democide), of the Jews and others of different ethnic groups, classes, religions and 'undesirables' was understood as the \"Final [medical] Solution\" \u2013 an en masse medical procedure for the collective cleansing and healing of the Aryan race and the German people by purging of the Jewish infection from Aryan blood.The entire apparatus of Hitlercare had a diabolical veneer of respectability. The death camps had doctors and medical staff to meet and greet the millions of newly arrived Jews by feigning a welcoming atmosphere to their unsuspecting victims. According to Lifton, the seemingly benign manner that doctors and medical personnel conducted the genocide of the Jews falsely added some legitimacy thus obscuring the true wicked nature of their authorized \"medical\" procedures. History chronicles that approximately 10 million people were murdered under Hitlercare, including six million Jews. Hitlercare or the German universal healthcare system was a key aspect of the Nazi version of the fundamental transformation of Germany and the world, nevertheless Hitler's 1,000 year Reich lasted only 12 years (1933-45). Hitlercare's original plan included the genocide of about 25 million Jews, Poles and Slavs in Eastern Europe using efficient and economical realization of the so-called \"racial hygiene\" plan of Hitler and Nazism \u2013 thus Hitlercare was the Nazis Final Medical Solution.This is the inevitable diabolical nature of universal healthcare. It substitutes natural law for the God-state of government to decide and dictate the right to of who lives and who dies for entire classes of society, as opposed to letting people make their own choices using the free market and private enterprise to secure their own healthcare. Did Hitler do this because he was so worried about the health of the people and nations he conquered? No, Hitler loved universal healthcare so excessively that he forced it on occupied countries because it gave him the power and control over entire classes of people to facilitate his ghastly plans of genocide against them. As a leftist and a socialist, universal healthcare gave him the power to put policy into practice, to socially engineer society according to his own depraved, racist means/ends. With an executive decree, whole classes of people would be eliminated without any judicial due process being required. \"We are five days away from fundamentally transforming the United States of America\" \u2013 These were the words of treason Obama uttered on the eve of his election which he and his progressive minions have been now systematically implementing for almost six years. This is also the explanation why Obama and the Democratic Socialist Party so frantically demands universal healthcare in order to achieve their socialist \"life's goal\" \u2013 which is \"to dethrone God and destroy capitalism,\" as Karl Marx, the father of socialism and communism once confessed. But first the socialist and progressive bureaucrats who dominate Washington, D.C. must deconstruct the rights of the individual in order to be able to socially engineer their new utopian society which would be unachievable without a centrally-controlled universal healthcare system where all \"undesirables\" can be eradicated at will by the God-state.Republicans miss the point when they argue that universal healthcare doesn't work; it works for the progressive elite at the top of the socialist God-state under the pretext of \"health\" to remove the \"unfit\" from society. Nazicare worked in favor of the Nazi Reich for their purposes to efficiently eradicate certain classes of people en masse without due process. In the twenty first century we have much more advanced technology to kill many more people not only more efficiently, but with the mass acceptance and perfection of abortion (almost 60 million casualties since Roe v. Wade 40 years ago) mass killings have become so pass\u00a8\u00a6 America has elected a man twice who between 2001-03 was the only legislator in Illinois to vote four times against the Born Alive Infant Protection Act \u2013 legislation requiring medical attention be given for those courageous babies who survived abortions.Hitler would be pleased.Since the Founders of America's Republic understood that humanity is by nature anti-God, hypocritical and duplicitous they created a system of checks and balances and limitations of government power because they realized someday a dictator like a Barack Obama would arise and seize power in the United States for himself by ignoring or deconstructing the U.S. Constitution. Since President Woodrow Wilson's Socialist revolution of 1913 it seems that dishonest politicians and egotistical, corrupt judges have disregarded and circumvented the constitution to such a degree as to render it now to be a deadletter.Nazi Germany is the true birthplace, and Hitler, the real father of universal healthcare and like Lenincare, Stalincare, Maocare, Castrocare and Obamacare, all universal healthcare systems are derivative of Marxism, socialism, communism, progressivism, postmodernism and thus are antithetical to America's founding constitutional principles of God, the Bible, natural law, equality, liberty and truth. Like Hitlercare, Obamacare which will inevitably lead to healthcare rationing, death panels, millions of uninsured and eventually the systematic genocide of the weak, minorities, enfeebled, the elderly and political enemies of the God-state.Obama is using his Gestapo and SS Stormtroppers or so-called \"Navigators\" (e.g., the youth, the unions, Planned Parenthood, NAACP, ACORN, La Raza, the Democratic Socialist Party apparatus, etc.) to propagandize the poor, the mis-educated and minorities who are being exploited to lead this final blitzkrieg towards accepting universal healthcare, but like in Hitler's Germany once the reality of their treachery metastasizes, guess who will be the first ones forced to sacrificelives for the Fatherland in our march towards a \"perfect\" society without illness or suffering? History has repeatedly demonstrated that the weakest and most vulnerable have often been the first victims to be eliminated.Please purchase my latest opus dedicated to that Conservative Colossus, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas.
