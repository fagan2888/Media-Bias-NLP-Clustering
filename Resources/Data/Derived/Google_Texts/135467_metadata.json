That panelist \u2014 Sara Collins \u2014 assured journalists that website issues and low enrollment were not indicative of deeper problems with the health care law itself.\n\nThe teletraining has been flagged by the conservative advocacy group Freedomworks in a post titled \u201cJournalists Receive Specialized Training From Group Led by Former Health Adviser to the President,\u201d which was then picked up by the Washington Examiner.\n\nThe SABEW session titled \u201cHealth Care 101: How will the Affordable Care Act impact open enrollment?\u201d featured a \u201cpanel of experts\u201d that review \u201cthe issues journalists should be paying attention to and offer up story suggestions and reporting tips aimed at both general assignment writers and those on the health care beat.\u201d\n\nThe Commonwealth Fund is led by David Blumenthal, who served as President Obama\u2019s national coordinator for health information technology from 2009 to 2011, the Examiner noted.\n\nThe Fund makes no secret of its support for Obama\u2019s universal health care plan, as its site declares that it \u201cmarshaled its resources\u2026to produce timely and rigorous work that helped lay the groundwork for the historic Affordable Care Act, signed by President Obama in March 2010.\u201d\n\nCollins, one of the panelists for the SABEW\u2019s Oct. 28 session, is vice president of the Health Care Coverage and Access program. She can be heard on a recording of the teletraining remarking that healthcare.gov\u2019s user-related problems and low participation so far don\u2019t point to \u201cdeeper issues\u201d with the law.\n\n\u201cI think it is a website issue,\u201d Collins said, adding that \u201cthe barriers that people have faced in terms of getting health insurance have been far more significant in the past than these website problems.\u201d Collins names lack of subsidies toward premiums and being charged more on the basis of your health as first among past issues.\n\nCollins also emphasized to journalists listening in that signing up young, healthy people will be very important for Obamacare\u2019s success, as their premiums will help subsidize the higher premiums of older, sicker people.\n\nOther panelists included Reed Abelson of the New York Times and Karen Pollitz of the Kaiser Foundation.\n\nHere\u2019s a video primer on the Commonwealth Fund:\n\nA section on the SABEW website also includes a link to \u201cHealth Care Resources from the Commonwealth Fund\u201d under a \u201cTip Sheets\u201d section:\n\nThe SABEW and the Commonwealth Fund are reportedly hosting a two-day symposium at Reuters headquarters in downtown Chicago Thursday and Friday, Freedomworks noted, saying the select journalists there \u2014 representing outlets such as Bloomberg News, CNN Money, the Associated Press, Forbes, the New York Times \u2014 will receive \u201cspecialized education in health care reporting.\u201d\n\nWhile a SABEW spokesman did not respond to the Examiners\u2019 request for comment, the journalism society has in the past tried to offer a variety of opinions. In fact, TheBlaze\u2019s own president, Betsy Morgan, and even Glenn Beck spoke on an SABEW panel at a New York City gathering last month. Our own Becket Adams regularly attends SABEW events.\n\n(H/T: Cold Fury)\n\n\u2013", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "The Society of American Business Editors and Writers (SABEW) recently conducted a teletraining session on covering Obamacare issues that included as panelist a member of the The Commonwealth Fund, an organization run by a former Obama adviser.\u00a0That panelist -- Sara Collins -- assured journalists that website issues and low...", "title": "Journalists Being Trained on Obamacare Reporting Topics by Group That Worked Toward Health Care Bill Passage", "url": "http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2013/11/07/journalists-trained-on-obamacare-reporting-topics-by-group-that-worked-toward-health-care-bill-passage/", "image": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/david-blumenthal-620x387.jpg", "site": "@theblaze", "card": "summary", "account_id": 1512944287}, "keywords": "business, writers, editors, getting, trained, cover, obamacare, by, pro, obamacare, group, commonwealth, fund", "sailthru.tags": "government, media, obamacare, video, author-daveurbanski, site-theblazecom", "facebook-count": 148, "gplus-count": 2, "msapplication-TileColor": "#282b2d", "sailthru.guid": "theblazecom/700948", "categories": "obamacare,video,government,media", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/medium150x150.png", "comment-count": 27, "description": "The Society of American Business Editors and Writers (SABEW) recently conducted a teletraining session on covering Obamacare issues that included as panelist a member of the The Commonwealth Fund, an organization run by a former Obama adviser.\u00a0That panelist -- Sara Collins -- assured journalists that website issues and low...", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/wide310x150.png", "linkedin-count": 0, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/small70x70.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/large310x310.png", "fb": {"admins": 517831498}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.theblaze.com/", "viewport": "width=device-width", "og": {"site_name": "The Blaze", "description": "The Society of American Business Editors and Writers (SABEW) recently conducted a teletraining session on covering Obamacare issues that included as panelist a member of the The Commonwealth Fund, an organization run by a former Obama adviser.\u00a0That panelist -- Sara Collins -- assured journalists that website issues and low...", "title": "Journalists Being Trained on Obamacare Reporting Topics by Group That Worked Toward Health Care Bill Passage", "url": "http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2013/11/07/journalists-trained-on-obamacare-reporting-topics-by-group-that-worked-toward-health-care-bill-passage/", "image": {"width": 620, "identifier": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/david-blumenthal-620x387.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 387}, "type": "article"}, "dc.date": "2013-11-07T18:45:27+00:00", "twitter-count": 109}, "article_summary": "That panelist \u2014 Sara Collins \u2014 assured journalists that website issues and low enrollment were not indicative of deeper problems with the health care law itself.\nIn fact, TheBlaze\u2019s own president, Betsy Morgan, and even Glenn Beck spoke on an SABEW panel at a New York City gathering last month.\nOther panelists included Reed Abelson of the New York Times and Karen Pollitz of the Kaiser Foundation.\nThe Society of American Business Editors and Writers (SABEW) recently conducted a teletraining session on covering Obamacare issues that included as panelist a member of the The Commonwealth Fund, an organization run by a former Obama adviser.\nThe teletraining has been flagged by the conservative advocacy group Freedomworks in a post titled \u201cJournalists Receive Specialized Training From Group Led by Former Health Adviser to the President,\u201d which was then picked up by the Washington Examiner."}
