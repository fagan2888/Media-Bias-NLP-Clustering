It\u2019s got to be what\u2019s in the best interest of this country. Shutting down the government is ridiculous.\u201d\n\nHe went on: \u201cThis idea of us being bomb throwers, being zealots who, \u2018It\u2019s my way or the highway\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s craziness. Government is about negotiation, government is about compromise.\u201d\n\nIn Bevin\u2019s retelling, the secret key to Ronald Reagan\u2019s success as president was bipartisanship: \u201cThe reason things got done was because Ronald Reagan, as staunch conservative on one end, and Tip O\u2019Neill, as staunch liberal on the other end, remembered ultimately at the end of the day that they were there not to serve their party but they were there to serve the people. And that\u2019s something that we are missing.\u201d (In a later interview, Kentucky businessman Bevin even called arch-liberal O\u2019Neill \u201cstatesmanlike.\u201d)\n\nThese comments from Bevin appear on a video provided to National Review Online by Bevin\u2019s political opponents, which you can watch below.\n\nIn the closing seconds of the video, Bevin was just arriving at an important caveat. Compromise is crucial, he said, but not compromise of \u201cone\u2019s principles and not [on] things that are in the wrong direction for this country.\u201d With that, the video cuts off.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019ve said is not to confuse compromise for capitulation \u2014 for compromising one\u2019s principles,\u201d Bevin told me in a 25-minute interview about his remarks. \u201cMitch McConnell is the messenger of capitulation, which he then turns around and tries to sell to us as having been a compromise. Very big difference.\u201d\n\nDuring his Hardin County appearance, Bevin was asked: Didn\u2019t Republicans play into Democrats\u2019 hands by precipitating the shutdown? He focused his ire concerning the shutdown on how the dispute came to a head in September:\n\nDid anybody not hear the question? The question is \u2013 he\u2019s under the assumption \u2013 he\u2019s wondering: Would it be self-defeating to be somebody who would be a proponent of shutting down the government? Are we not playing into the hands essentially of Democrats with that thought process? I would say absolutely, that would be the case, which is why not even a little am I a proponent of that. So if in anything that I\u2019ve said I\u2019ve left you with that impression, I don\u2019t know how I\u2019ve done that. \u200b Because not even to the slightest degree am I a proponent of shutting down the government. Not even a little bit. In fact, I think our shutdown of it was so irresponsible because of the fact that we waited until the eleventh hour and fifty-ninth minute before we even started to discuss it. That\u2019s one of the other things that\u2019s destroying this country, is that we have become so partisan.\n\nIt\u2019s true that, throughout the fall budget debate, nobody said they wanted a shutdown. Reporters would press conservatives in the Capitol: But aren\u2019t you worried that shutting down the government will backfire? We don\u2019t want to shut down the government, they would say, we want to fund everything in the government except Obamacare.\n\nIn that sense, Bevin\u2019s proclamation of his opposition to shutting down the government is not remarkable. Another part of his analysis is also more or less routine: He points out that Republicans in Washington didn\u2019t press the issue until September, far too late to win the public\u2019s hearts and minds. \u201cEven [Utah senator] Mike Lee\u2019s letter\u201d \u2014 organizing members against including Obamacare money in the next government-funding bill \u2014 \u201ccame out I believe in July,\u201d he noted in the interview. A number of conservatives have made similar complaints about how the GOP leadership handled the shutdown episode. If they had been beating the war drums to defund Obamacare throughout the summer, the thinking goes, the battle might have been won.\n\nIt\u2019s Bevin\u2019s broader indictments of partisanship and intransigence that are difficult to square with his public image as a conservative alternative to McConnell \u2014 specifically, his statement that \u201cthis idea of us being bomb throwers, being zealots who \u2018it\u2019s my way or the highway\u2019\u201d is \u201ccraziness.\u201d One way to take Bevin\u2019s remarks is as a rejection of the labels that liberals use to criticize conservatives. Matt Hoskins, the head of the Senate Conservatives Fund group that has been strongly backing his campaign, says: \u201cMatt Bevin was pushing back against the language used by Mitch McConnell and the Democrats to attack conservatives. We aren\u2019t bomb throwers and we never supported a government shutdown. Conservatives have a system of principles that we believe should guide public policy because they will empower Americans to live free and prosperous lives. Matt Bevin is right to push back against these false labels.\u201d\n\nBut still, whom was he referring to as \u201cbomb throwers\u201d? Whom is he directing his criticisms at?\n\nNot Ted Cruz, not Mike Lee, not Rand Paul, Bevin told me. \u201cI applaud them for taking a principled stand. An informed stand. A representative stand. Because what they were doing was representing and fighting for the will of the people.\u201d\n\nSo, who?\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t naming specific people,\u201d he said. \u201cI can think of one example that I\u2019m not even going to throw out there because it\u2019ll get spun into its own little orbit of misinterpretation. There have been people who will just take a stand and will not move off of it regardless of how ill-informed that stance is. . . . That was not the case in anything involved in the budget debate, or the funding of Obamacare.\u201d\n\nBevin also explained his thinking on Reagan more fully. Reagan and O\u2019Neill both understood they needed to \u201cfocus on what is in the best interest of the country, and of the people, and not specifically what my ideology or party are telling me to do,\u201d he said. \u201cNow in reality \u2014 and now I\u2019m just being partisan here, but I\u2019m telling you \u2014 when people focus on reality, and pragmatism, and when they focus on what is in the best interest of the country, they do move towards conservative thinking. I\u2019m biased, but I\u2019m telling you. That\u2019s how Reagan got it done, because O\u2019Neill was smart enough to appreciate that Reagan was right. And he wasn\u2019t such a stubborn zealot that he wouldn\u2019t compromise on that.\n\n\u201cDo you think Harry Reid would have done anything as remotely statesmanlike as Tip O\u2019Neill? And believe me, I\u2019m not a fan of Tip O\u2019Neill. Gracious. But, that said, do you think that Harry Reid would have done anything as remotely statesmanlike? I don\u2019t. He is a man who will dig his heels in and throw a little temper tantrum. . . . He\u2019s been getting away with it because McConnell gets played like a sock puppet by Harry Reid. Repeatedly.\u201d\n\nAt the end of our conversation, Bevin vowed to stick to principle if elected to the Senate.\n\n\u201cIf 100 people are saying \u2018x\u2019 and I know that \u2018y\u2019 is the right thing to do, then \u2018y\u2019 is what I\u2019ll do. If a hundred are zigging, and zagging is the right thing to do, then zagging is what I\u2019ll do. I have always been this way, and this is exactly how I\u2019ll be as a senator,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2014 Jonathan Strong is a political reporter for National Review Online.", "article_metadata": {"tweettext": "Matt Bevin\u2019s Moderate Side", "sailthru.author": "Jonathan Strong", "description": "Let\u2019s put it this way: It\u2019s not the kind of rhetoric you\u2019d expect to hear from an insurgent primary candidate running to Mitch McConnell\u2019s right.\n\n\u201cWe have way too much partisanship in Washington,\u201d Matt Bevin told a Republican audience in Hardin County, Ky., on Monday. \u201cAnd it shouldn\u2019t be a function of, you know, the Democrats are this, therefore the Republicans have to be opposed to it or vice versa.

And that\u2019s something that we are missing.\u201d (In a later interview, Kentucky businessman Bevin even called arch-liberal O\u2019Neill \u201cstatesmanlike.\u201d)\n\nThese comments from Bevin appear on a video provided to National Review Online by Bevin\u2019s political opponents, which you can watch below.\n\n\n\nIn the closing seconds of the\u00a0video, Bevin was just arriving at an important caveat. Compromise is crucial, he said, but not compromise of \u201cone\u2019s principles and not [on] things that are in the wrong direction for this country.\u201d With that, the video cuts off.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019ve said is not to confuse compromise for capitulation \u2014 for compromising one\u2019s principles,\u201d Bevin told me in a 25-minute interview about his remarks. \u201cMitch McConnell is the messenger of capitulation, which he then turns around and tries to sell to us as having been a compromise. Very big difference.\u201d\n\nDuring his Hardin County appearance, Bevin was asked: Didn\u2019t Republicans play into Democrats\u2019 hands by precipitating the shutdown? He focused his ire concerning the shutdown on how the dispute came to a head in September:\u00a0\n\n\nDid anybody not hear the question? The question is \u2013\u00a0he\u2019s under the assumption \u2013\u00a0he\u2019s wondering: Would it be self-defeating to be somebody who would be a proponent of shutting down the government? Are we not playing into the hands essentially of Democrats with that thought process?\n\nI would say absolutely, that would be the case, which is why not even a little am I a proponent of that. So if in anything that I\u2019ve said I\u2019ve left you with that impression, I don\u2019t know how I\u2019ve done that.\u00a0\u200b\n\nBecause not even to the slightest degree am I a proponent of shutting down the government. Not even a little bit. In fact, I think our shutdown of it was so irresponsible because of the fact that we waited until the eleventh hour and fifty-ninth minute before we even started to discuss it.\n\nThat\u2019s one of the other things that\u2019s destroying this country, is that we have become so partisan.\n\n\n#page#\n\nIt\u2019s true that, throughout the fall budget debate, nobody said they wanted a shutdown. Reporters would press conservatives in the Capitol: But aren\u2019t you worried that shutting down the government will backfire? We don\u2019t want to shut down the government, they would say, we want to fund everything in the government except Obamacare.\u00a0\n\nIn that sense, Bevin\u2019s proclamation of his opposition to shutting down the government is not remarkable. Another part of his analysis is also more or less routine: He points out that Republicans in Washington didn\u2019t press the issue until September, far too late to win the public\u2019s hearts and minds. \u201cEven [Utah senator] Mike Lee\u2019s letter\u201d \u2014 organizing members against including Obamacare money in the next government-funding bill \u2014 \u201ccame out I believe in July,\u201d he noted in the interview. A number of conservatives have made similar complaints about how the GOP leadership handled the shutdown episode. If they had been beating the war drums to defund Obamacare throughout the summer, the thinking goes, the battle might have been won.\n\n#ad#It\u2019s Bevin\u2019s broader indictments of partisanship and intransigence that are difficult to square with his public image as a conservative alternative to McConnell \u2014 specifically, his statement that \u201cthis idea of us being bomb throwers, being zealots who \u2018it\u2019s my way or the highway\u2019\u201d is \u201ccraziness.\u201d One way to take Bevin\u2019s remarks is as a rejection of the labels that liberals use to criticize conservatives. Matt Hoskins, the head of the Senate Conservatives Fund group that has been strongly backing his campaign, says: \u201cMatt Bevin was pushing back against the language used by Mitch McConnell and the Democrats to attack conservatives. We aren\u2019t bomb throwers and we never supported a government shutdown. Conservatives have a system of principles that we believe should guide public policy because they will empower Americans to live free and prosperous lives. Matt Bevin is right to push back against these false labels.\u201d\n\nBut still, whom was he referring to as \u201cbomb throwers\u201d? Whom is he directing his criticisms at?\n\nNot Ted Cruz, not Mike Lee, not Rand Paul, Bevin told me. \u201cI applaud them for taking a principled stand. An informed stand. A representative stand. Because what they were doing was representing and fighting for the will of the people.\u201d\n\nSo, who?\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t naming specific people,\u201d he said. \u201cI can think of one example that I\u2019m not even going to throw out there because it\u2019ll get spun into its own little orbit of misinterpretation. There have been people who will just take a stand and will not move off of it regardless of how ill-informed that stance is.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0That was not the case in anything involved in the budget debate, or the funding of Obamacare.\u201d\n\nBevin also explained his thinking on Reagan more fully. Reagan and O\u2019Neill both understood they needed to \u201cfocus on what is in the best interest of the country, and of the people, and not specifically what my ideology or party are telling me to do,\u201d he said. \u201cNow in reality \u2014 and now I\u2019m just being partisan here, but I\u2019m telling you \u2014 when people focus on reality, and pragmatism, and when they focus on what is in the best interest of the country, they do move towards conservative thinking. I\u2019m biased, but I\u2019m telling you. That\u2019s how Reagan got it done, because O\u2019Neill was smart enough to appreciate that Reagan was right. And he wasn\u2019t such a stubborn zealot that he wouldn\u2019t compromise on that.\n\n\u201cDo you think Harry Reid would have done anything as remotely statesmanlike as Tip O\u2019Neill? And believe me, I\u2019m not a fan of Tip O\u2019Neill. Gracious. But, that said, do you think that Harry Reid would have done anything as remotely statesmanlike? I don\u2019t. He is a man who will dig his heels in and throw a little temper tantrum.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0He\u2019s been getting away with it because McConnell gets played like a sock puppet by Harry Reid. Repeatedly.\u201d\n\nAt the end of our conversation, Bevin vowed to stick to principle if elected to the Senate.\n\n\u201cIf 100 people are saying \u2018x\u2019 and I know that \u2018y\u2019 is the right thing to do, then \u2018y\u2019 is what I\u2019ll do. If a hundred are zigging, and zagging is the right thing to do, then zagging is what I\u2019ll do. I have always been this way, and this is exactly how I\u2019ll be as a senator,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2014 Jonathan Strong is a political reporter for\u00a0National Review Online.", "card": "summary", "title": "Matt Bevin\u2019s Moderate Side, by Jonathan Strong, National Review"}, "sailthru.date": "Thu, 2014-01-16 00:00", "robots": "follow, index", "sailthru.title": "Matt Bevin\u2019s Moderate Side", "keywords": "Jonathan Strong", "fb": {"app_id": 129250807108374}, "sailthru.tags": "Matt Bevin\u2019s Moderate Side, Jonathan Strong, National Review", "msvalidate.01": "E48498F585100158A880ED1615918208", "google-site-verification": "OOtPjyj3i8ggfSXzZ7MPoTiwFy_JnfzKMPkjZ5bhpk0", "copyright": "\u00a9 National Review, Inc.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Jonathan Strong, Politics, Nation, World"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd16b\"", "article_summary": "\u2014 Jonathan Strong is a political reporter for National Review Online.\nAnd that\u2019s something that we are missing.\u201d (In a later interview, Kentucky businessman Bevin even called arch-liberal O\u2019Neill \u201cstatesmanlike.\u201d)These comments from Bevin appear on a video provided to National Review Online by Bevin\u2019s political opponents, which you can watch below.\n\u201cWe have way too much partisanship in Washington,\u201d Matt Bevin told a Republican audience in Hardin County, Ky., on Monday.\nThat\u2019s how Reagan got it done, because O\u2019Neill was smart enough to appreciate that Reagan was right.\nVery big difference.\u201dDuring his Hardin County appearance, Bevin was asked: Didn\u2019t Republicans play into Democrats\u2019 hands by precipitating the shutdown?"}
