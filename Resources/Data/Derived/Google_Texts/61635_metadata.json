The postgame fireworks show was loaded and set to go. But first there was a baseball game to be played, and Rockies fans \u2014 including many, young and old, wearing No. 2 Colorado jerseys \u2014 assumed they\u2019d have a chance to watch Tulowitzki play in person.\n\nAfter Friday night, only two more home games remained before the all-star break, a four-day respite from games for those not heading to Cincinnati.\n\nYet Tulowitzki, who hit .381 in June and had a career-high 21-game hitting streak going into Friday night, and who unquestionably is one of the elite players in the game, wasn\u2019t in the lineup.\n\nSometimes the Rockies\u2019 organizational policy seems to be not just maddening, but also tone-deaf.\n\nEspecially in the wake of Tulowitzki\u2019s offseason hip labrum surgery, his occasional absence from the starting lineup is a familiar part of Walt Weiss\u2019 standard operating procedure. This season it started early, in the sixth game, when he pinch hit and struck out in the ninth inning of a 6-5 April 12 loss at home to the Cubs.\n\nWe know it\u2019s coming, but it\u2019s still aggravating.\n\nTulowitzki had a three-run homer in the Rockies\u2019 11-3 win over Atlanta on Sunday, and he goes into the break hitting .313, with 10 homers and 49 RBIs.\n\n\u201cI feel like we\u2019ve been on the same page with that,\u201d Weiss said after the game. \u201cDuring my time here, it\u2019s been our priority, and Tulo\u2019s been real upfront in communicating every few days about where he\u2019s at. \u2026 I think it\u2019s been somewhat of a factor, but he\u2019s been healthy and strong and having a great year.\u201d\n\nGoing into the break, Tulo- witzi has played in 79 of the Rockies\u2019 88 games, and quadriceps stiffness led to at least two of his absences from the box score. In six others, he came on as a pinch hitter. Two of his non-starts involved starting the other game in a doubleheader.\n\nYes, it\u2019s \u201cworking\u201d in the sense that Tulowitzi, injury-prone in recent seasons, hasn\u2019t missed a string of three or more consecutive games in 2015.\n\nThe phrase \u201ccorrelation does not imply causation\u201d is for science, not baseball or sports journalism. So we are conditioned to accept that if \u201cB\u201d follows \u201cA,\u201d then \u201cA\u201d caused \u201cB.\u201d\n\n\u201cWalt\u2019s the manager, and obviously, we talked about that in spring, that he was going to try and give me as many days (off) when he felt like I needed it as possible, and so far in this first half it\u2019s worked,\u201d Tulowitzki said Sunday. \u201cI think if something\u2019s working, you kind of stick with it, so I think that will be the plan.\u201d\n\nAmong other things, this has bolstered his trade value, given that his injury problems in recent seasons plus his contract either did \u2014 or should have \u2014 given potential trading partners pause \u2026 or cause to stay away from acquiring him, period.\n\nBut this idea that a shortstop should be like, oh, an NHL goalie who gets predictable games off \u2014 Patrick Roy routinely played about 65-of-82 games in his prime \u2014 is as irksome as having a team with three of its four infielders in the All-Star Game at 10 games under .500 at the break.\n\n(No. It\u2019s not all pitching.)\n\nAfter San Francisco manager Bruce Bochy made Tulowitzki an injury replacement Saturday, the Rockies shortstop will be making his fifth all-star appearance Tuesday, joining teammates Nolan Arenado and DJ LeMahieu on the NL roster.\n\nHe won\u2019t get the night off.\n\nTerry Frei: tfrei@denverpost.com or twitter.com/TFrei", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Frei: Time off for Troy Tulowitzki annoying", "title": "Frei: Time off for Troy Tulowitzki annoying", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/07/12/frei-time-off-for-troy-tulowitzki-annoying/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg", "height": 512}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-12T21:24:25+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-23T02:45:40+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Terry Frei"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce694\"", "article_summary": "But first there was a baseball game to be played, and Rockies fans \u2014 including many, young and old, wearing No.\nAfter Friday night, only two more home games remained before the all-star break, a four-day respite from games for those not heading to Cincinnati.\nTo his credit, Tulowitzki didn\u2019t want any part of overt campaigning, and St. Louis starting pitcher Carlos Martinez turned out to be the choice.\n2 Colorado jerseys \u2014 assumed they\u2019d have a chance to watch Tulowitzki play in person.\nAs the deadline for voting \u2014 including via Twitter and texting \u2014 for the final National League All-Star Game roster spot approached Friday afternoon, the Rockies invited fans to attend a gathering at a team sponsor restaurant to rally support for Troy Tulowitzki."}
