Wearing full turnout gear, firefighters from across Maine and New England raced down the slopes of Bridgton's Shawnee Peak Saturday at the 12th annual Mary's Firemen for a Cure ski race.

Tap for report

Teams of five firefighters held on to 50 feet of fire hose as they raced down a giant slalom course.

The event was started by Mary Allen, a longtime Shawnee Peak employee, and her husband Wayne, a volunteer firefighter. Mary died from breast cancer in 2005. Her family still holds the event in her honor and to support those battling breast cancer.

The Mary's Fireman for a Cure race benefits the Susan G. Komen Foundation, and WMTW News 8 is a proud sponsor of this event. More that $100,000 has been raised for the foundation over the last 11 years.
