The report suggests that companies that use independent contractors should be forced to offer them benefits \u2014 a responsibility the companies are eager to avoid.\n\n\u201cFirms have structured themselves to be capable of growing quickly by reducing their commitments to employees,\u201d the report reads. \u201cBy reducing the need to provide a stable, predictable income for the people doing the work, these companies free up capital and reduce overhead costs. Second, these firms also reduce costs by avoiding typical, minimum-mandated corporate expenses such as employment taxes and benefits.\u201d\n\nThat lack of predictable income can lead to \u201cexploitative employment conditions, with little warning about when and how much they will work in a given week,\u201d the authors write.\n\nThe economics of these companies is at the center of a widening new partisan divide over labor and technology. Republicans have championed, in particular, Uber, as a force for free-market competition in the face of existing city and state taxi regulations. They see the popularity of the companies as, in particular, a potential opening with younger voters \u2014 Sen. Marco Rubio writes in his new book that Uber converts progressives into free-market conservatives. The party likewise focused on the issue of Uber and government regulation in last year\u2019s Illinois governor\u2019s race.\n\nBut the Center for American Progress calls for increased government oversight, urging regulators to \u201cestablish best practices and to make legal or regulatory changes to discourage abuse.\u201d And the group\u2019s political ties \u2014 its former chairman, John Podesta, is expected to chair Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign \u2014 mean that its white papers could quickly become platform planks.\n\nWhile the report and (in an earlier BuzzFeed News report) several executives of sharing economy companies said the federal benefits \u2014 and specifically the Affordable Care Act \u2014 can solve independent contractors\u2019 health-care issues, other benefits remain intrinsically tied to employment. In addition to creating government programs to address the needs of families and workers who turn to the sharing and gig economy for their primary source of income and have no access to traditional benefits like workers\u2019 compensation and pensions, the Center for American Progress also suggests attempting to \u201cmodernize the employer-employee relationship to ensure that employers continue in their traditional roles.\u201d\n\nUsing the construction industry in the U.S. (\u201cwhere firms use subcontractors and create subsidiaries\u201d) as an example, the report also warns against misclassifying workers as contractors to avoid employer responsibilities.\n\n\u201cTo address these problems, basic legal protections for employees need to apply when an employment relationship exists, and these protections should not be negated by legal form. Firms that are in reality employers should be made responsible for basic protections such as overtime pay, workers\u2019 compensation, and unemployment compensation, as well as for following other protections provided by labor law. In some countries, certain rights are quite rightly bestowed on individuals after a continued period of employment by the same organization.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"bf": {"buzzid": 3575788, "userid": 1823255}, "description": "The Center for American Progress report targets Uber and other popular apps that use subcontractors to power their success \u2014 without...", "copyright": "Copyright 2016 BuzzFeed, Inc.
