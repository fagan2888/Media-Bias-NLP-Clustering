And basically, you know, call it the stupidity of the American voter or whatever, but basically that was really, really critical for the thing to pass.\u201d\n\nGruber made similar comments elsewhere. In 2012, he said a \u201cbasic exploitation of the lack of economic understanding of the American voter\u201d enabled Obama and congressional Democrats to include in Obamacare the \u201cCadillac Tax\u201d on expensive health care plans, and in 2013, he said \u201cthe American people are too stupid to understand\u201d how a tax on insurers gets passed along through higher premiums.\n\nGruber was an instrumental part of the effort by congressional Democrats and the Obama administration to pass the ACA. Despite recent Democratic attempts to suggest Gruber played little role in designing and promoting Obamacare, the fact is Gruber\u2019s fingerprints are all over the law.\n\nStart with the fact he was a \u201ckey architect\u201d of Romneycare, according to reporter Sam Stein of The Huffington Post, the Massachusetts health care reform law on which Obamacare was largely based. The Obama administration then hired Gruber to provide economic analysis of its health care reform plan and the Congressional Budget Office used his information to determine the budget impact.\n\nIn addition, according to a Politico story quoting Obama administration \u201ccar czar\u201d Steven Rattner, Gruber was the administration\u2019s \u201cguru on health care\u201d and \u201can important figure in helping to put Obamacare together.\u201d\n\nGruber has since been paid handsomely by several states to advise them on implementing Obamacare, a total of more than $5 million.\n\nSo, despite President Obama\u2019s recent claim Gruber was just \u201csome advisor who never worked on our staff,\u201d it\u2019s obvious the professor played a central role in Obamacare\u2019s design, passage, and implementation.\n\nBut although there are a variety of reasons to be outraged at Gruber\u2019s comments, conservatives should take a breath and realize they\u2019re probably not the ones Gruber was calling stupid and ignorant.\n\nSo who was Gruber referring to?\n\nThe people who fit Gruber\u2019s description are the Democratic base, independents who voted for Obama and the congressional Democrats in 2008, and the journalists, think-tank denizens, and others who were and remain reliable defenders of Obamacare and the administration\u2019s policies.\n\nConsider who was actually fooled by the promises about lower premiums, keeping your plan and your doctor, deficit reduction, and other key claims regarding Obamacare. It sure wasn\u2019t Republicans or conservatives, most of whom have consistently seen through the lies Gruber and others offered in support of Obamacare.\n\nNo, the people who bought into the scam (and forcibly took the rest of us along with them) were the Democratic base and a large number of independents who trusted Obama and his administration. They believed the Democrats were telling the truth when Republicans challenged their claims about Obamacare. They were wrong.\n\nYou\u2019ve never heard of a swindler insulting the intelligence of people who didn\u2019t fall for his scam, only the people who did. Once you recognize this, it\u2019s clear who should and who shouldn\u2019t feel insulted by Gruber\u2019s comments about the stupidity of the American voter.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how many of these true believers in Obamacare recognize they were conned and insulted and learn from the experience. They\u2019ve had a lot of chances to learn, but once again, they fell for the same old scam.\n\nSean Parnell ([email protected]) is a research fellow and the managing editor of Health Care News at The Heartland Institute.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Human Events", "description": "Conservatives should take a breath and realize they\u2019re probably not the ones Gruber was calling stupid and ignorant.", "title": "Gruber wasn\u2019t insulting Republicans and conservatives | Human Events", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://humanevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/jon_gruber-480x270.jpg", "url": "http://humanevents.com/2014/12/04/gruber-wasnt-insulting-republicans-and-conservatives/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"pages": 212436860202}, "description": "Conservatives should take a breath and realize they\u2019re probably not the ones Gruber was calling stupid and ignorant.", "twitter": {"image": "http://humanevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/jon_gruber-480x270.jpg", "site": "@humanevents", "card": "summary", "description": "Conservatives should take a breath and realize they\u2019re probably not the ones Gruber was calling stupid and ignorant."}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcda51\"", "article_summary": "It sure wasn\u2019t Republicans or conservatives, most of whom have consistently seen through the lies Gruber and others offered in support of Obamacare.\nSean Parnell ([email protected]) is a research fellow and the managing editor of Health Care News at The Heartland Institute.\nGruber was an instrumental part of the effort by congressional Democrats and the Obama administration to pass the ACA.\nBut although there are a variety of reasons to be outraged at Gruber\u2019s comments, conservatives should take a breath and realize they\u2019re probably not the ones Gruber was calling stupid and ignorant.\nOnce you recognize this, it\u2019s clear who should and who shouldn\u2019t feel insulted by Gruber\u2019s comments about the stupidity of the American voter."}
