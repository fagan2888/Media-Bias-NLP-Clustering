His interests focus on distributive justice within the global environmental emergency.\n\nIs our civilization doomed?\n\nI don\u2019t think so, though I\u2019ll admit that the case for doom is a pretty good one. But I wish to be clear on two points. First, it\u2019s not too late to avoid disastrous climate change. We\u2019re in trouble, no doubt about that, but we have the science, the technology, and the money to save ourselves. Second, we simply won\u2019t do so if we give ourselves up to the habits of pessimism.\n\nIs \u201cpeak oil\u201d a good way to talk about all this? The short answer is No, and this despite the fact that it draws attention to planetary limits, and to the great resource crunch that\u2019s now rising on the horizon. Still, peak oil \u2013 as a stance and as a reality \u2013 is essentially irrelevant, and even distracting, at least in the all-important climate context. We\u2019re just not running out of fossil energy soon enough, not in time to prevent climate catastrophe. It\u2019s not even going to be close.\n\nBottom line: If we even get close to burning the fossils we already have on our books, we\u2019re toast. And yet we\u2019re dead certain to discover a whole lot more. All this has been clear for years, and widely known since Bill McKibben put \u201cunburnable carbon\u201d onto the map last year in his great Rolling Stone piece. But the human \u201ccarbon budget\u201d is now official, for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change just cast it into some pretty solid numbers. As Thomas Stocker, the co-chair of the IPCC \u2019s \u201cWorking Group 1,\u201d put it: \u201cThere\u2019s a finite amount of carbon that you can burn if you don\u2019t want to go over 2\u00b0C [of warming]\u2026. That implies if there is more than that [in fossil fuel reserves], that you leave some of that carbon in the ground.\u201d\n\nMost of that carbon, actually.\n\nIn this context, it\u2019s a bit grim to watch as the peak-oilers strain to save their epicycles. Recent strategies include arguing that the fossil fuel industry\u2019s flacks are overestimating the size of the oil reserves; that the size of the frack-gas resource in particular is being radically exaggerated; that, in any case, they never said that oil would run out, only that it would get crushingly expensive. All of which is questionable, and all of which avoids the real issue, which is that, as the grassroots climate-justice folks have been saying for years, we have to \u201cleave the oil in the soil.\u201d\n\nThe key question is how we\u2019re going to do this. How are we going to negotiate a \u201cgreat transition\u201d to a new world in which \u2013 despite planetary limits \u2013 all people, everywhere, are able to find paths to dignified and sustainable ways of life? Because if this isn\u2019t the promise of the great transition, then we really are doomed. And this is a very different promise from the one suggested by peak-oil images of universal energy scarcity and \u201cpowering down.\u201d\n\nThe deeper issues here turn on the problems of economic justice in a small world. Does peak oil help on this front? It does not. Nor does it help us counter the fossil-fuel cartel, which has essentially melded with the most oligarchic and nihilistic wings of the plutocracy (e.g., the Koch brothers).\n\nFortunately, there are other approaches: A breakthrough in the global effort to negotiate a fair and ambitious climate treaty would help a great deal. So would real campaign finance reform in the United States. So would the political deepening of the \u201cclimate preparedness\u201d and \u201ccommunity resilience\u201d movements. And the fossil-fuel divestment movement, especially, seems to be a harbinger of great things to come.\n\nNone of these strategies, however, can work unless there is simultaneously a technology revolution of the first order. And here\u2019s where the problem of ritual pessimism raises its large and ugly head. Because most peak-oilers, it turns out, not only believe that we\u2019ve entered a time of immutable and altogether generalized scarcity, they also believe that technological optimism of any sort is a form of denial. See, for example, their take on what\u2019s called \u201cEnergy Return on Energy Investment,\u201d and their tales of a world in which we\u2019re so short of affordable fossil energy that we can\u2019t actually build out the infrastructure of a high-functioning global renewable economy. Point them to alternative views \u2013 like, say, those in the Rocky Mountain Institute\u2019s excellent Reinventing Fire \u2013 and they reply that they\u2019ve run the numbers, and that Amory Lovins is wrong.\n\nAnd there\u2019s another strange twist in their tale, one in which \u201cdebt\u201d is suddenly as big a problem as net-energy deficits. Take a look, for example, at Richard Heinberg\u2019s The End of Growth , wherein we learn that \u201cthe world economic system is a kind of Ponzi scheme that is only kept going by the confidence of its participants,\u201d and that \u201cthe Keynesian remedy doesn\u2019t cure the ailment but merely extends the suffering.\u201d Or check out Climate After Growth , a new Post-Carbon Institute report that announces that \u201cthe debate between stimulus and austerity is a distraction\u201d and that the coming reckoning is caused by not only \u201cthe end of the age of cheap oil,\u201d and \u201cthe diminishing economic impacts of new technologies\u201d but also by \u201cthe vast mountains of debt that we have incurred.\u201d\n\nReader Opinion\n\nPlease understand me. I don\u2019t intend to be divisive. But I read Climate After Growth on the morning of October 1, even as the House Republicans \u2013 the shock troops of idiot neoliberalism \u2013 were taking to the air to wave their \u201cdebt crisis\u201d banners against the Affordable Care Act. In this context, seeing the peak-oil worthies go on about \u201cthe vast mountains of debt that we have incurred\u201d struck me as a bit rich \u2013 and more than a bit dangerous.\n\nWe do indeed need a new politics of limits, but not one that tries to paper over tough realities \u2013 for example inequality, now hardening into a new caste system \u2013 with an overstated and tone-deaf pessimism. Just having a politics of limits isn\u2019t good enough. Our politics are going to be a politics of justice within limits, or they\u2019re going to drive the green movement into irrelevance. Or into something even worse.\n\nFor an opposing view, read what Aaron G.
