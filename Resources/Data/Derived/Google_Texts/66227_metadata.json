Publishers seem to be running out of forward-thinking story ideas so quickly that they\u2019ve resorted to going back to origin stories en masse. This year we\u2019ve already seen prequels for Gears of War, Tomb Raider, God of War, XCOM and then Batman\u2019s Arkham franchise in October.\n\nThe thing with prequels is that we\u2019re visiting a character or story already knowing how it ends. It\u2019s potentially difficult to create any drama in the storyline because we already know the outcome. For Capcom\u2019s Lost Planet 3, however, that\u2019s not a problem.\n\nLost Planet 3 takes places decades before the first Lost Planet game, where the planet E.D.N. III is still an ice world (in Lost Planet 2, the ice was melted and it became a tropical environment). You play as Jim Peyton, a contractor hired by construction company NEVEC to help harvest T-Energy, a valuable mineral on the planet and inside the planet\u2019s creatures, which could help humans back on Earth.\n\nBut Peyton\u2019s sole purpose is just to make enough money to take care of his wife and young son back on Earth. That is, until he finds out the truth about NEVEC and E.D.N. III.\n\nThe gameplay unfolds in two stages, the first as a third-person shooter and then as a first-person mech game. While on the ground, you have a grappling hook to help you get to hard-to-reach places, you\u2019re able to carry a pistol at all times, grenades and your choice of two larger weapons\n\nYour larger weapons \u2014 shotgun, hunting rifle, assault rifle, crossbow, pulse rifle and others \u2014 are all upgradeable with one or two components (mostly to carry more ammo or make them more powerful). For the most part, however, the weapons aren\u2019t all that interesting, especially since the action in the game gets really repetitive.\n\nThere are a variety of creatures, called Akrid, which are continually up in your face in both the open environments and confined spaces. You take them out run-and-gun style, along with the bigger boss Akrid, where you can dodge their attacks, shoot the glowing parts of their bodies, lather, rinse and repeat. The third-person gameplay wouldn\u2019t feel so unexciting if it featured cooler, more creative weapons and the enemies died in different ways \u2014 instead of just exploding the same way no matter which weapon you use.\n\nIn previous Lost Planet games players were equipped with a Vital Suit (VS), a mechanized device that boasts guns, rocket launchers, boosters, etc. In Lost Planet 3, you are working with a construction rig that has a drill, a large claw and other components that are added later, like a wrench and a blowtorch. Being inside the rig breaks up some of the monotony of the action, allowing you to pick up Akrid with your claw and drill through their bellies. But throughout the whole game you\u2019re thinking, \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be nice to have some guns on this bad boy, too?\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also multiplayer modes that feature different variations of the usual team deathmatch and capture the flag, with an upgrade system to customize multiplayer characters. The multiplayer also has the Vital Suits from previous games and team battles against Akrid.\n\nDespite all the shortcomings with the gameplay, it was the solo campaign\u2019s story that kept me coming back. The game is well-written and well-acted with its share of twists and turns and surprises throughout. The banter between Peyton and his wife through video messages seems authentic and later, I came to actually care about the same things and people that Peyton cared about and hoped for a satisfactory resolution. The game is not a must-have but could be worth checking out \u2014 unless you want to save your money for the more anticipated prequels coming out in a few months.\n\nGAME ON SCORE: 3 stars\n\n4 stars = Get On It!\n\n3 stars = Nice Job\n\n2 stars = Meh\n\n1 star = Avoid It\n\n0 stars = Nooooo!!!", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "batman,batman: arkham origins,Capcom,Gears of War,God of war,Lost planet,Lost Planet 3,Tomb Raider,XCOM", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "Game On", "description": "Prequels have the difficult task of creating drama in a storyline because we already know the outcome, but not in Lost Planet 3.", "title": "Lost Planet 3 review: Sci-fi franchise returns to its icy origins", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/videogames/2013/09/09/lost-planet-3-review-prequel/7950/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/videogames/files/2013/09/lost-planet-3-screenshot-2.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Prequels have the difficult task of creating drama in a storyline because we already know the outcome, but not in Lost Planet 3.", "title": "Lost Planet 3 review: Sci-fi franchise returns to its icy origins in worthy prequel", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/videogames/2013/09/09/lost-planet-3-review-prequel/7950/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/videogames/files/2013/09/lost-planet-3-screenshot-2.jpg", "creator": "@", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Prequels have the difficult task of creating drama in a storyline because we already know the outcome, but not in Lost Planet 3."}, "article_summary": "Lost Planet 3 takes places decades before the first Lost Planet game, where the planet E.D.N.\nIII is still an ice world (in Lost Planet 2, the ice was melted and it became a tropical environment).\nIn previous Lost Planet games players were equipped with a Vital Suit (VS), a mechanized device that boasts guns, rocket launchers, boosters, etc.\nFor Capcom\u2019s Lost Planet 3, however, that\u2019s not a problem.\nIn Lost Planet 3, you are working with a construction rig that has a drill, a large claw and other components that are added later, like a wrench and a blowtorch."}
