Coordinated Health does not offer surgery at the site, although it offers surgery at its hospital locations.\n\nCoordinated Health vacated two clinics, one across the street at Emrick Boulevard and one clinic on Greenwood Avenue in Palmer Township, to combine services into the new facility, where 100 employees are on site.\n\nWith the Affordable Health Care Act or Obamacare, it\u2019s timely now that people have accessibility with medical services, particularly on a regional level, Dr. Emil DiIorio, CEO of Coordinated Health, said Thursday.\n\n\u201cWe have a problem with complexity, and the root of the problem is it\u2019s very difficult to be cost-conscious. It is the job that the patient is asking us to do,\u201d DiIorio said. \u201cListening to the patient and trying to get done what the patient is asking you to do, that as an organization is the focal point of our integration. When quality goes up, the cost goes down as well.\u201d\n\nThis building offers a primary care division with family doctors, easy access and cardiology services on the first floor, he said.\n\nHealth care in the U.S. and Europe tends to have a culture where institutions try to be everything to everyone. The clinics are the solution shops, the areas where diagnoses are made and rehabilitation is given, DiIorio said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of bringing all these pieces together; the complexity is what causes quality problems,\u201d DiIorio said. \u201cYou have to start at the root.\u201d\n\nConverting to electronic health records is also a major focus of Coordinated Health. It can be costly and painful, but it remains the central nervous system of any health care organization, he said.\n\n\u201cUltimately what will be needed is portability with the patient for the electronic health record,\u201d DiIorio said.\n\nSeveral officials were on hand.\n\n\u201cDr. DiIorio has been a health care innovator for a long time,\u201d said U.S. Rep. Charlie Dent. \u201cHe delivers care on a regional level, how to integrate primary care. I suspect as health care continues to change, and I suspect it will, we are going to need people like DiIorio to help us sort it out.\u201d\n\nCoordinated Health has been a part of the Bethlehem Township family for many years, said Thomas Nolan, president of the township board of commissioners. As the population increases and continues to age, facilities such as Coordinated Health are welcome to the township, Nolan said.\n\nThis year represents the 25th anniversary of Coordinated Health, and the new company logo signifies the continuum of care that it strives to offer patients, from concierge to integrated clinic, according to Jim Tsokanos, president of Coordinated Health.\n\n\u201cThey [patients] want to go to one location in the community,\u201d Tsokanos said. \u201cIt\u2019s all integrated in several locations connected to our hospitals. We can keep overhead down; they get better faster.\u201d\n\nCoordinated Health is adding to its New Jersey presence, as well. In the first quarter of 2015, it is scheduled to open a health care facility in Lopatcong Township, near Phillipsburg.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Lehigh Valley Business", "description": "Offering its first public tour of its newest facility, Coordinated Health officials introduced the features of the latest campus to join the organization\u2019s growing health care business.", "title": "Coordinated Health showcases latest site, in Bethlehem Township | LVB", "url": "http://www.lvb.com/article/20140822/LVB01/140829954/coordinated-health-showcases-latest-site-in-bethlehem-township", "image": "http://www.lvb.com/storyimage/LV/20140822/LVB01/140829954/AR/0/AR-140829954.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "lvb.com", "description": "Offering its first public tour of its newest facility, Coordinated Health officials introduced the features of the latest campus to join the organization\u2019s growing health care business.", "creator": "@BrianLehigh", "image": {"src": "http://www.lvb.com/storyimage/LV/20140822/LVB01/140829954/AR/0/AR-140829954.jpg"}, "title": "Coordinated Health showcases latest site, in Bethlehem Township | LVB", "site": "@lvb_com", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "Offering its first public tour of its newest facility, Coordinated Health officials introduced the features of the latest campus to join the organization\u2019s growing health care business.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdedb3\"", "article_summary": "Offering its first public tour of its newest facility, Coordinated Health officials introduced the features of the latest campus to join the organization\u2019s growing health care business.\nCoordinated Health does not offer surgery at the site, although it offers surgery at its hospital locations.\n\u201cYou have to start at the root.\u201dConverting to electronic health records is also a major focus of Coordinated Health.\nIn the first quarter of 2015, it is scheduled to open a health care facility in Lopatcong Township, near Phillipsburg.\nAs the population increases and continues to age, facilities such as Coordinated Health are welcome to the township, Nolan said."}
