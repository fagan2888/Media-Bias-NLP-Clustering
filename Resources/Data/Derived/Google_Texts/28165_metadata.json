With each name, the noise level raised.\n\n\u201cIt is something that I will remember for the rest of my life - it was a once in a lifetime thing, unless we all play college ball together,\u201d Chris said.\n\nChris is a senior, Brian a junior and Augistine a sophomore. It was the first time all three had suited up for a varsity game this season, and it came on Kodiak\u2019s senior night.\n\nChris and Brian have played varsity for most of the season, while Anderson called up Augistine from the junior varsity team specifically to give Chris a chance to play with all of his siblings.\n\n\u201cYou try to figure out something to make it special for the seniors, and I thought that would be great for him to get out there with his brothers,\u201d Anderson said.\n\nChris soaked up all 70 seconds of his time on the floor, in what turned out to be a 13-point defeat. None of the brothers cracked the scoring column, but it didn\u2019t matter.\n\n\u201cI was telling my brothers on the sideline just to have fun. This is my last time with you guys on the court,\u201d Chris said.\n\nThe three brothers have bonded over basketball. They all played Little Dribblers. They all spent their summers playing hoops under the midnight sun and they all played in the Philippines on vacation.\n\n\u201cWe share the same room, all three of us,\u201d Brian said. \u201cIt is all basketball stuff.\u201d\n\nChris has played at every level, except for this year. He doesn\u2019t get on the floor much, but when he does he gives it his all. The 5-foot-5 guard has scored 25 points this season.\n\n\u201cIt is something new to me because in the past three years of my basketball career I have played a lot,\u201d Chris said. \u201cThis year was something different. I am happy where I am and at least I am part of a team. Just being with the team, bonding with them and playing with them makes me happy.\u201d\n\nEven though Chris doesn\u2019t contribute in many games, his impact is felt in practices.\n\n\u201cHe gets in these guys\u2019 faces like we want him to,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cHe is a tough player and all over the court on these guys. He is great for that. He has a great attitude and it takes a special person to do that.\u201d\n\nAnd for one night, with their parents in the stands, the Caguings had their moment on the court.\n\n\u201cThat minute and 10 seconds was something pretty special to me,\u201d Chris said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "With time ticking off the game clock, and Kodiak trailing Wasilla by double figures, coach David Anderson peered down the bench and motioned to three players.", "Author": "DEREK CLARKSTON", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "With time ticking off the game clock, and Kodiak trailing Wasilla by double figures, coach David Anderson peered down the bench and motioned to three players.", "title": "3 Kodiak brothers appear in final basketball game", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/mar/14/3-kodiak-brothers-appear-in-final-basketball-game/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/03/14/7f06754548897d0b700f6a7067007475.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/03/14/7f06754548897d0b700f6a7067007475.jpg", "title": "3 Kodiak brothers appear in final basketball game", "description": "With time ticking off the game clock, and Kodiak trailing Wasilla by double figures, coach David Anderson peered down the bench and motioned to three players.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d"}, "article_summary": "KODIAK, Alaska (AP) - With time ticking off the game clock, and Kodiak trailing Wasilla by double figures, coach David Anderson peered down the bench and motioned to three players.\n\u201cYou try to figure out something to make it special for the seniors, and I thought that would be great for him to get out there with his brothers,\u201d Anderson said.\n\u201cIt is something new to me because in the past three years of my basketball career I have played a lot,\u201d Chris said.\nIt was the first time all three had suited up for a varsity game this season, and it came on Kodiak\u2019s senior night.\nThe whistle finally came with 1 minute, 10 seconds left in last Saturday\u2019s game, and for the first and last time, the three brothers took the floor together, the Kodiak Daily Mirror newspaper (http://bit.ly/1C2PvBM) reported."}
