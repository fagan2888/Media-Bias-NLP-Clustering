WASHINGTON — A 97-mph fastball followed up by an 89 mph power changeup is a pretty effective combination.

Effective enough for right-hander Tommy Kahnle to land the job as the Rockies’ closer, at least for the time being.

Friday night, on his 26th birthday, the 6-foot-1, 235-pound Kahnle recorded the first save of his career, shutting down the Nationals in the ninth inning and striking out National League MVP candidate Bryce Harper to end the game.

“I think if we get in that situation again tonight, Tommy will be out there,” manager Walt Weiss said Saturday before the Rockies took on Washington in Game 2 of a three-game series at Nationals Park. “Over the last week or so, the plan was to mix and match in that ninth inning and play matchups — who’s the freshest, all of those things are a factor.

“But I have been wanting to see Tommy in that ninth inning. That’s the next step for him. He showed up really well last night, so we will give him opportunities. I’m not necessarily committing to anything, but I think the way Tommy performed last night, he gets a shot.”

The Rockies thought they struck gold with Adam Ottavino as their closer early in the season before he underwent season-ending Tommy John surgery. Then John Axford stepped into the role and performed well until faltering over the last month.

Kahnel, 0-0 with a 2.60 ERA in 27 ⅔ innings, said he approaches his job the same way, no matter if it’s the seventh inning or the ninth.

“I try not to let anything affect how I pitch,” Kahnle said. “I just go out and attack hitters.”
