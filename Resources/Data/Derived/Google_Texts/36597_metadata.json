She was lying beside the railroad tracks, unable to move or bark, Sullivan said.The GoFundMe.com account was started to raise money for Hope\u2019s recovery. So far, just over $1,600 of the $5,000 fundraising goal has been reached...According to the page, \u201cHope\u2019s body temperature was 92 degrees when she was found in the middle of the night, lying on the ground in the rain. She was unable to do more than wag her tail, which she does whenever she sees someone. Her weight is 27 pounds, about half of what she should weigh. She was approximately one hour from death when she was found. Hope will be facing months of medical care and rehabilitation.\u201d..Sullivan\u2019s best guess is that Hope is between 1 and 4 years old. Based on her condition, Sullivan believes Hope was abandoned. She had a clean coat and her nails and foot pads were in good condition.\u201cThis dog wasn\u2019t out and about. This dog was not a stray dog,\u201d she said...Hope is slowly making progress, Sullivan said.\u201cOne day at a time.
