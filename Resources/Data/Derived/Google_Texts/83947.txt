Odell Beckham Jr., Peyton Manning sees you.

Shortly after Manning and the Broncos finished off the Dolphins at Sports Authority Field at Mile High on Sunday, Beckham Jr., a rookie receiver for the Giants, pulled in an acrobatic, one-handed touchdown catch from Eli Manning that had the entire nation in awe.

And Peyton was among the millions gawking over the spectacular catch.

“That’s as fine a catch as I’ve seen,” Peyton said. “I was watching it on TV and it’s just what Newman graduates do. It’s what happens.”

Beckham Jr., who was drafted 12th overall by the Giants in last summer’s draft, was a three-sport letterman at Isidore Newman School in New Orleans, the same high school the Manning brothers attended. In his senior season, Beckham Jr. had 50 catches for 1,010 yards and 19 touchdowns, joining Cooper Manning as the only players in school history to have 1,000 or more yards in a season.

As of Wednesday, Peyton said he hadn’t spoken to Eli about play.

“No, not about that particular play,” Peyton said. “That was a heck of a catch. I was kind of glad I got to see it live action on TV as opposed to seeing the replays. It was a heck of a catch.”
