Many of the pictures he shot that day have become iconic reminders of the attack.\n\nHe still remembers the smell of burning flesh and the sight of wounded men floating in water coated with oil.\n\n\u201cThat was a horrible day,\u201d Doyle, 91, said on Sunday, the 73rd anniversary of a surprise attack that plunged the United States into World War II.\n\nDoyle and Luz Valerio, 96, a U.S. Army veteran who manned a seacoast gun battery during the attack, were honored at a memorial service Sunday at the Colorado National Guard headquarters in Centennial.\n\n\u201cI could see all those buildings burning,\u201d Valerio said.\n\nThe bombing took the lives of about 2,400 Americans and wounded 1,178 others.\n\nDoyle learned to fly from a crop-duster pilot who lived near his boyhood home in western Colorado. After Pearl Harbor, he went on to fly scouting missions.\n\nFlying a plane that had a camera bolted to its belly, he was shot down twice during the Battle of Guadalcanal.\n\n\u201cI got some shrapnel in my butt,\u201d he said.\n\nA second wound was more serious. The Japanese had soldiers hiding in a forest on islands near Guadalcanal, and the Marines wanted to know what they were up to, Doyle said.\n\nThey sent him to photograph the activity.\n\n\u201cI was at 8,000 feet and three Zeros jumped me,\u201d he said. He dodged them, but when he brought his aircraft closer to the ground, he was set upon by more Japanese planes.\n\n\u201cThat was when I woke up in Australia,\u201d he said. \u201cMy head was crushed, and I had a wet cloth on my brain.\u201d\n\nDoctors patched him up, but he required a second surgery to stop the bleeding in his brain.\n\nDoyle, who was medically dischaged from the Navy in 1943, won a Distinguished Flying Cross and two Purple Hearts.\n\nRetired Air Force Brig. Gen. Salvatore \u201cSal\u201d Villano, a Vietnam-era veteran, conducted a ceremony to honor the two.\n\n\u201cIt gives me a great sense of satisfaction to honor these war heroes,\u201d Villano said.\n\nTom McGhee: 303-954-1671, tmcghee@denverpost.com or twitter.com/dpmcghee", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Pearl Harbor survivor reflects on \u201chorrible day\u201d", "title": "Pearl Harbor survivor reflects on \u201chorrible day\u201d", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/12/07/pearl-harbor-survivor-reflects-on-horrible-day/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141207__20141208_A4_CD08PEARLp1.jpg", "height": 440}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141207__20141208_A4_CD08PEARLp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-07T14:48:18+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T03:20:12+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThat was a horrible day,\u201d Doyle, 91, said on Sunday, the 73rd anniversary of a surprise attack that plunged the United States into World War II.\nHe still remembers the smell of burning flesh and the sight of wounded men floating in water coated with oil.\n\u201cIt gives me a great sense of satisfaction to honor these war heroes,\u201d Villano said.\nMany of the pictures he shot that day have become iconic reminders of the attack.\nDoyle, who joined the U.S. Navy in 1939 when he was 16, grabbed a camera and went to work."}
