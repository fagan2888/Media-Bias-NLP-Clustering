A man has died after his small plane crashed in Pratt County.

The crash happened near Southeast 60th and Southeast 20 Avenues. That's just a few miles east-southeast of Pratt.

The Kansas Highway Patrol said the pilot was attempting to land on a private runway when his propeller hit the dirt, causing the plane to overturn.

The 85-year-old pilot was pronounced dead at the scene. Troopers identified him as Harrison Dale Rosenbaum of Pratt. He was the only person on board.

People in the community say this is surprising, because Rosenbaum was an accomplished pilot who's held a commercial pilots license for many years.

Neighbors say he flew just about every Saturday. This time they saw him take off and land, but didn't hear any noise from the crash.

Investigators from the NTSB are expected to arrive on scene Sunday morning.
