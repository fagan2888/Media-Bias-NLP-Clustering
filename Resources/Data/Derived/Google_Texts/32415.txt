WASHINGTON (AP) — The focus on Hillary Rodham Clinton’s email practices as secretary of state is causing historians and government record-keepers to take stock of an imperfect system for preserving the government’s history.

In this age of email, texting, Twitter and beyond, there are more records than ever on the workings of government.

But it’s also easy to make these records disappear — and challenging to find a manageable way to capture what’s significant.

Here’s how Paul Wester, chief records officer for the government, puts it: “The situation is not as good as we would like it to be,” he says — particularly during the transition from paper to electronic records.

He says the National Archives was surprised to learn Clinton used only a personal email account and server while secretary of state.
