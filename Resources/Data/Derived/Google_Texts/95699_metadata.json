What is trans-inclusive health care, and why is it necessary?\n\nTrans-inclusive health care can mean a lot of things. It\u2019s widely believed that the Affordable Care Act (ACA) made it illegal for insurance companies to discriminate against transgender individuals seeking healthcare coverage; however, this is partially correct. The ACA made it so that an insurance company can\u2019t deny you healthcare coverage for being transgender, but that doesn't mean they will cover transition-related treatment, such as hormone replacement therapy or transition-related surgeries that are often deemed \"aesthetic.\"\n\nMoreover, because many medical procedures are gendered, someone seeking a treatment for a procedure that would traditionally be rendered to someone of the opposite sex may have that procedure denied. For instance, a pregnant trans man seeking prenatal care or a pap smear may have that procedure denied because most insurance companies do not render that procedure to men. Likewise, trans women who need prostate exams may have that claimed denied as well.\n\nRead more on page 2>>>", "article_metadata": {"pubexchange": {"image": "http://www.latina.com/sites/default/files/styles/news_377x234/public/articles/2015-09-09/Joanna-Cifredo2.jpg?itok=Nx3FB3mV"}, "description": "This week\u2019s #WCW is a badass puertorrique\u00f1a shaking up the health care system so that it\u2019s inclusive of all mujeres, not just those who are cisgender.", "copyright": "LATINA", "og": {"url": "http://www.latina.com/lifestyle/our-issues/wcw-joanna-cifredo", "image": "http://www.latina.com/sites/default/files/articles/2015-09-09/Joanna-Cifredo2.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "This week\u2019s #WCW is a badass puertorrique\u00f1a shaking up the healthcare system so that it\u2019s inclusive of all mujeres, not just those who are cisgender.\nPLUS:\u00a0Woman Crush(ing the Patriarchy) Wednesday: Brandy Monta\u00f1o", "title": "Woman Crush(ing the Patriarchy) Wednesday: Joanna Cifredo"}, "fb": {"app_id": 456703624436354, "pages": 48654660602}, "keywords": "Joanna Cifredo wcw, Joanna Cifredo woman crushing the patriarchy Wednesday, Joanna Cifredo trans-inclusive health care, Joanna Cifredo trans Latina, Joanna Cifredo transgender Latina, Joanna Cifredo Latina feminist", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "wcw, transgender, health, LGBT"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfa37\"", "article_summary": "PLUS: Woman Crush(ing the Patriarchy) Wednesday: Brandy Monta\u00f1oWorking toward health equity and trans-inclusive health care, Joanna Cifredo\u2019s impressive career started in Central Florida, where she taught comprehensive sex education to at-risk and underserved youth.\nYou recently received the Visionary Voice Award by National Sexual Violence Resource Center for your work on health equity and trans-inclusive health care.\nWhat is trans-inclusive health care, and why is it necessary?\nTrans-inclusive health care can mean a lot of things.\nBelow, find out just how Cifredo\u2019s advocacy is putting another dent in the patriarchy."}
