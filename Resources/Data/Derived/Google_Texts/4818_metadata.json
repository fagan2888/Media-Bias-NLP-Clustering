It addressed the current abuses.\n\nThe city of Philadelphia, for example, seized 500 homes this year, according to an Atlanta Journal-Constitution story that Hendrix researched.\n\nA family was evicted from its home because law enforcement seized heroin from one occupant, even though nobody in the home had been convicted of a crime.\n\nGodfrey also gave the example of the Cobb County Sheriff\u2019s Office, which in 2003 seized $9.5 million worth of assets, roughly 76 percent of its budget.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a high incentive to pocket the money,\u201d he said, explaining that only a few states compel police officers to place seized property in a neutral account.\n\nHendrix\u2019s argument is that if a criminal is driving someone else\u2019s car, that third, possibly innocent party should not be punished.\n\nAnother bill supported smart highways, in which LED lights illuminate the medians and sides of main arteries.\n\nA senate bill proposed changing voter registration so that voters can rank their candidates.\n\nUnder the current system, explained Hendrix, libertarians are hesitant to back a third party candidate when their ideals are more closely aligned with the Republicans than the Democrats\u2014the two parties most likely to gain seats.\n\nOconee County High School student Emory Linder said he enjoyed debating controversial bills that deal with the legalization or decriminalization of marijuana and a repeal of a code allowing pharmacists to refuse certain types of contraceptives.\n\nLinder said students aren\u2019t beholden to a party, though there was tacit understanding when people leaned toward the left or right.\n\n\u201cThe checks and balances in Youth Assembly are pretty good,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are lobbyists, but they don\u2019t carry too much weight on your vote.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo a certain extent, it\u2019s a little bit better than the real word,\u201d said Hendrix, citing a rule that says a bill can only be one page in length. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to add earmarks when you have to be so concise.\u201d\n\nHe gave the Affordable Care Act, commonly labeled Obamacare, as an example of a piece of legislation that was bound to draw fire simply because of its tedious length.\n\n\u201cBy observing what takes place at Youth Assembly, our real-world legislators should be reminded of the reason they hopefully decided to pursue a political office,\u201d said North Oconee High Assistant Principal Eric Hamilton who advised the following students at Youth Assembly: Shariff Ciss\u00e9, Afahse Poteh, Georgios Samaras, and Robert Sligh.\n\n\u201cThe students' somewhat pure manner is what government of the people, for the people, and by the people was intended to be,\u201d said Hamilton.\n\nLinder noted that some of former and current government officials he spoke to went through Youth Assembly when they were teenagers.\n\n\u201cI believe that the future of our state will be in great hands if [our students] choose to [run for public office],\u201d said Hamilton. \u201cThey were able to experience first hand how state government works and maybe even more importantly, how it doesn't work. I saw them raising questions regarding appropriations and ethics, as well as questioning the role and responsibility of government in society.\u201d\n\nFor more on this story, see the Dec. 24 edition of The Oconee Enterprise, on sale now at convenience stores and grocery stores and newspaper boxes throughout Oconee County.
