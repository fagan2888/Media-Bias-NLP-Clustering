At that gathering in Colorado Springs, about 3,000 select Republicans will vote on who should appear on the June 28 primary ballot. It\u2019s not a winner-take-all thing; a candidate only has to break the 30 percent mark to qualify.\n\nBut with state Sen. Tim Neville, R-Littleton, expected to surpass that threshold easily, the challenge for Littleton and Glenn is to marshal enough support to crack 30 percent as well. Anything less for those two, and that\u2019s it \u2014 campaign finito. So March 1 is critical to Littleton and Glenn because they must get their supporters on the path to be among the 3,000 select Republicans who vote April 9.\n\nThose mini-elections \u2014 to pick the people who will pick the primary candidates \u2014 start Tuesday and continue through county assemblies later in March.\n\n\u201cFor me, it\u2019s the only route. It\u2019s the route that I respect,\u201d Glenn said of the caucus process.\n\nIt is not, however, the only way to get on the June 28 primary ballot and earn a chance to face incumbent Michael Bennet, a Democrat.\n\nColorado\u2019s primary system allows candidates who don\u2019t want to navigate the caucus system to \u201cpetition\u201d their way on the ballot. That requires each candidate to gather 1,500 signatures from each of the state\u2019s seven congressional districts \u2014 or 10,500 statewide.\n\nSeveral major Senate candidates have chosen to take this route, notably former state Rep. Jon Keyser, businessman Robert Blaha, former Aurora City Councilman Ryan Frazier and former CSU athletic director Jack Graham.\n\nThe advantage to the petition path is that it\u2019s less risky.\n\nHowever, the petition route can get expensive. Frazier, who is pursuing petitions but said he hasn\u2019t ruled out a convention bid either, estimated the low-end cost of a petition campaign is $130,000 to $180,000. The price tag can rise quickly, he added, the longer a candidate waits \u2014 although he added there were long-term advantages to the strategy.\n\n\u201cWe want to build a grassroots army,\u201d said Frazier of the petition drive. \u201cThis is a part of that.\u201d\n\nIn deciding between the petition or convention route, there\u2019s also a political calculus.\n\n\u201cThe attendees of the caucus are generally your most active and engaged Republican\u201d voter, said Dick Wadhams, the former state GOP chairman who now is running the Graham campaign. \u201cThey are naturally going to gravitate toward people who have been in elected office before.\u201d\n\nSo for a political outsider such as Graham, he added, it makes more sense to qualify for the ballot by petition. Especially because Graham put $1 million of his own money into his campaign account.\n\nThat option, however, is less viable for candidates such as Littleton or Glenn.\n\nSo Littleton said she\u2019s focusing on the March 1 caucus. She hired Elaine VanderJagt, a political consultant who in 2014 helped now state Attorney General Cynthia Coffman garner 69 percent of the GOP assembly vote.\n\nAnd later Littleton plans to target an unusual bloc of voters: GOP convention-goers who support petition candidates such as Keyser or Blaha. Because these candidates won\u2019t be on the ballot at the state convention, Littleton said she is courting these voters to help her crack 30 percent and give her campaign a jolt \u2014 and potentially add some intrigue to the June 28 primary.\n\n\u201cGoing the caucus route and getting out of there with 30 percent lends an air of credibility to funders and financers,\u201d Littleton said.\n\nAs a potential counter to this strategy, Neville may try to run up the score at the April 9 convention to keep Littleton and Glenn below the 30 percent mark.\n\nIn a recent fundraising email, Neville highlighted the importance of a \u201cstrong turnout\u201d March 1 to his overall campaign, so much so that he is offering backers a chance to win an AR-15 rifle.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t think of a better way to get that word out before March 1st than by giving away a brand new AR-15,\u201d he wrote. \u201cOf course, I know the anti-gun media may hate it,\u201d he noted. But \u201cI am the pro-gun, pro-Constitution candidate in this race for U.S. Senate.\u201d\n\nNeville\u2019s supporters include Dudley Brown, the executive director of Rocky Mountain Gun Owners and a force potent enough in the GOP caucus process that other candidates made note of that endorsement. It\u2019s one reason why Neville is likely to emerge from the April 9 convention \u2014 although it\u2019s uncertain by how much.\n\nNeville did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nIf Neville can\u2019t block Littleton or Glenn from the June 28 ballot, it could add a new layer of uncertainty to a primary slate that is likely to include several petition candidates such as Keyser, Blaha, Frazier and Graham.\n\nFormer state GOP Chairman Ryan Call said Neville would be hurt most if a candidate such as Littleton makes the primary.\n\nNot only would it deny him the \u201ctalking point of unified party support\u201d if he isn\u2019t the only one to emerge from the convention, but a Littleton candidacy could \u201ccarve more into\u201d Neville\u2019s conservative lane, he said.\n\n\u201cThe smart campaign \u2026 would be wise to throw their support behind an alternative to Neville\u201d at the assembly, he added.\n\nMark K.
