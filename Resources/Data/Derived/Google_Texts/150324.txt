About a dozen people attended the Cannabis Career Institute workshop at the conference center at Edgewater Beach Resort this morning.

The institute travels the country, teaching people about the industry, especially in states where voters are deciding, or have already decided to legalize marijuana in some form.

Robert Calkin is the founder of the institute and taught the class how to create their own medical dispensary or delivery service.

"We are hitting all of the major cities in Florida because we know that Floridians seem to be intensely interested in that subject," said Robert Calkin, Cannabis Career Institute Founder.

"It's 2014 and its time to make a change and I think everybody is ready for that," said Brandon Harper, Attendee.

Cannabis career institute has not scheduled a date for a second seminar in panama city beach, but officials say they could be back soon.
