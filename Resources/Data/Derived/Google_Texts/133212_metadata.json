Oakland, California-based Kaiser Foundation Health Plan Inc. also gave $270,000. Supporters, led by Santa Monica-based Consumer Watchdog, have raised $425,521.\n\nHealth insurers stand to lose control over raising rates in the most populous U.S. state at a time of dramatic growth in the customer base. More than 1.2 million people have enrolled in private health insurance plans under Obamacare through the end of March, according to Covered California, the state\u2019s health-insurance exchange.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is they want to continue to protect their excessive profits and their ability to set rates as they see fit,\u201d said Dave Jones, California\u2019s insurance commissioner, who is a Democrat and supports the ballot measure.\n\nPremiums for family medical coverage in California increased by 185 percent since 2002, with average monthly premiums for single coverage at $572 in 2013, compared with $490 nationally, according to a report released in January by the California HealthCare Foundation, an Oakland-based nonprofit group.\n\nJustify Rates\n\nThe ballot initiative would require insurers to disclose publicly and justify proposed rate changes and give the state insurance commissioner authority to reject increases. It would apply to every plan that covers individual and small-group policy holders.\n\nCalifornia voters in 1988 approved a ballot measure that gave the state insurance department the power to regulate rate changes for auto, property and casualty insurance.\n\nAbout 35 states have the authority to approve or deny rate changes, according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.\n\nDarrel Ng, a spokesman for WellPoint and Anthem, and Amy Thoma, a spokeswoman for Kaiser, declined to comment on the spending and referred questions to Robin Swanson, a spokeswoman for Californians Against Higher Health Care Costs, based in Sacramento.\n\n\u201cThis initiative creates a costly new bureaucracy that will be headed by a single elected politician who then has broad new powers over health care, including treatment options health insurance covers,\u201d Swanson said. \u201cTreatment decisions should be made by doctors and patients, not someone with a political agenda.\u201d\n\nThe California Medical Association is part of the group that opposes the initiative.\n\n\u2018Special Interests\u2019\n\n\u201cCalifornia just launched a new independent commission empowered to negotiate health-plan benefits,\u201d association President Richard Thorp said in an e-mailed statement, referring to Covered California. \u201cWe should allow them to do their job instead of passing a law that hands authority over health-care coverage to a politician who can take campaign contributions from special interests.\u201d\n\nJones said Covered California doesn\u2019t oversee premium changes.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s simply not true and an intentional misstatement of how the law works,\u201d he said. \u201cCovered California is governed by a board which negotiates rates. There\u2019s no regulation of rates by Covered California or any committee of Covered California.\u201d\n\nThe change is being sought as the Obama administration implements the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. As of March 31, more than 3 million Californians enrolled in health-insurance plans or in Medi-Cal, the state\u2019s health coverage for the poor, according to Covered California.\n\nEarly Lead\n\nThe $13.4 million already in the insurance industry\u2019s campaign fund comes with seven months to go before the November election.\n\n\u201cIt is unusual to have such substantial donations this early in the election process,\u201d said Daniel G. Newman, MapLight\u2019s president. \u201cIt shows what\u2019s at stake financially for those insurers and also what\u2019s at stake financially for health-insurance consumers.\u201d\n\nIn addition to WellPoint, Anthem and Kaiser, Blue Shield of California contributed $180,000 to oppose the measure and Health Net Inc. gave $135,000, according to MapLight, citing 2013-2014 election cycle data from the California Secretary of State. The California Association of Health Plans and UnitedHealth Group Inc.\u2019s United Healthcare unit each gave $30,000.\n\nThe largest support for the measure has come from Consumer Watchdog, at $250,000; the Committee for Corporate Accountability and Consumer Protection, $105,000, and the California Nurses Association, $50,000, according to the data.\n\nFunding Disparities\n\nMeasures with similar funding disparities have failed in recent years. In 2012, California voters rejected a proposal to raise cigarette taxes by $1 to fund cancer research that received $12.9 million in support from the American Cancer Society and other groups, while the opposition gave $47.8 million, led by Altria Group Inc. and Reynolds American Inc., according to MapLight data.\n\nThe financial advantage will give the measure\u2019s opponents the ability to run more television and radio advertisements and send out more mailers to sway voters, Newman said.\n\n\u201cThis battle will be a David and Goliath fight,\u201d said Carmen Balber, Consumer Watchdog\u2019s executive director. \u201cCalifornia voters are smart, and it raises red flags to the public when an industry spends overwhelmingly in opposition to something.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Alison Vekshin", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-04-08/wellpoint-leads-13-million-california-insurance-battle", "title": "WellPoint Leads $13 Million California Insurance Battle", "description": "WellPoint Inc., the second-largest U.S. health insurer, is leading companies that have poured $13.4 million into defeating a ballot initiative that would give California regulators the power to reject increases in health policy premiums.", "card": "summary", "site": "@business"}, "parsely-author": "Alison Vekshin", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "Anthem Inc,Health,California", "news_keywords": "Anthem Inc,Health,California", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-04-08/wellpoint-leads-13-million-california-insurance-battle", "parsely-title": "WellPoint Leads $13 Million California Insurance Battle", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff0000", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-04-08T01:31:46.360Z", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "WellPoint Inc., the second-largest U.S. health insurer, is leading companies that have poured $13.4 million into defeating a ballot initiative that would give California regulators the power to reject increases in health policy premiums.", "parsely-tags": "Anthem Inc,Health,California,Region: Global,Page: article", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.bwbx.io/business/public/images/favicons/mstile-144x144-bbd2101292.png", "date": "2014-04-08T01:31:46.360Z", "parsely-section": "science-energy", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "og": {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-04-08/wellpoint-leads-13-million-california-insurance-battle", "type": "website", "site_name": "Bloomberg.com", "description": "WellPoint Inc., the second-largest U.S. health insurer, is leading companies that have poured $13.4 million into defeating a ballot initiative that would give California regulators the power to reject increases in health policy premiums.", "title": "WellPoint Leads $13 Million California Insurance Battle"}, "fb": {"status": "WellPoint Inc., the second-largest U.S. health insurer, is leading companies that have poured $13.4 million into defeating a ballot initiative that would give California regulators the power to reject increases in health policy premiums."}, "parsely-post-id": "N3OHCD6S972V01", "format-detection": "telephone=no"}, "article_summary": "\u201cCalifornia voters are smart, and it raises red flags to the public when an industry spends overwhelmingly in opposition to something.\u201d\nCalifornia voters in 1988 approved a ballot measure that gave the state insurance department the power to regulate rate changes for auto, property and casualty insurance.\nMore than 1.2 million people have enrolled in private health insurance plans under Obamacare through the end of March, according to Covered California, the state\u2019s health-insurance exchange.\nJustify RatesThe ballot initiative would require insurers to disclose publicly and justify proposed rate changes and give the state insurance commissioner authority to reject increases.\n\u201cCovered California is governed by a board which negotiates rates."}
