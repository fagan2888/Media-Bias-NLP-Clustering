(AP) \u2014 Former House Speaker John Boehner unloaded on Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz during a talk to college students, calling the Texas senator \u201cLucifer in the flesh.\u201d\n\nSpeaking at a town hall-style event at Stanford University, Boehner called front-runner Donald Trump his \u201ctexting buddy,\u201d but offered a more graphic response when asked about Cruz.\n\n\u201cLucifer in the flesh,\u201d the former speaker said. \u201cI have Democrat friends and Republican friends. I get along with almost everyone, but I have never worked with a more miserable son of a bitch in my life.\u201d\n\nHis comments were first reported by Stanford\u2019s student newspaper.\n\nCruz, campaigning in Fort Wayne, Ind., Thursday ahead of the state\u2019s May 3 primary, responded by saying Boehner was letting his \u201cinner Trump come out\u201d with his remarks. He attempted to turn the criticism into a slam on Trump.\n\n\u201cJohn Boehner in his remarks described Donald Trump as his texting and golfing buddy,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cSo if you want someone that\u2019s a texting and golfing buddy, if you\u2019re happy with John Boehner as speaker of the House and you want a president like John Boehner, Donald Trump is your man.\u201d\n\nBoth Cruz and Carly Fiorina, who was campaigning with him after he named her as his running mate Wednesday, referred to Boehner\u2019s comments during the rally.\n\nIn 2013, Cruz joined forces with tea party conservatives in the House in triggering a partial, 16-day government shutdown over demands to undo the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThere was no chance Obama would agree to such a step, and Republican leaders like Boehner saw the move as a fruitless effort that only hurt the GOP politically.\n\nTwo years later, the same House conservatives challenged Boehner\u2019s leadership, and the speaker decided to step down rather than allow a very public fight.\n\nBoehner\u2019s successor, House Speaker Paul Ryan, said at his weekly news conference Thursday that he has \u201ca much better relationship than that with Sen. Cruz.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy job is to help unify our party,\u201d Ryan said, when reporters pressed him on Boehner\u2019s comments. \u201cI have a very good relationship with both of these men, and I\u2019m going to keep it that way.\u201d\n\nCruz told reporters that he never worked with Boehner.\n\n\u201cThe truth of the matter is I don\u2019t know the man,\u201d Cruz said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve met John Boehner two or three times in my life. If I have said 50 words in my life to John Boehner, I would be surprised. And every one of them has consisted of pleasantries, \u2018Good to see you, Mr. Speaker.\u2019 I\u2019ve never had any substantive conversation with John Boehner in any respect.\u201d\n\nCruz said he was rebuffed by Boehner when he asked to meet with him during the government shutdown.\n\nCruz said Boehner\u2019s comments reflect his frustration with Americans who stand with Republicans who want to hold members of Congress accountable for their campaign promises to repeal Obama\u2019s health care law and pursue other conservative goals.\n\n\u201cWhen John Boehner calls me Lucifer, he\u2019s not directing that at me,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cHe\u2019s directing that at you.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "news_keywords": "news,national", "og": {"url": "http://www.mohavedailynews.com/news/boehner-calls-cruz-lucifer-in-the-flesh/article_dc066a16-0ded-11e6-bd5c-079d77766ef4.html", "site_name": "Mohave Daily News", "type": "article", "description": "FORT WAYNE, Ind.
