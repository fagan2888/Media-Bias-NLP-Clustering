Steve King, suggested a few tweaks to Cruz\u2019s candidacy.\n\nKing, a prominent Iowa conservative, warned Cruz against opposing the Renewable Fuel Standard, which has increased the share of biofuels in gasoline and given a huge boost to one of Iowa\u2019s major industries.\n\n\u201cI thought it would be good for this campaign from an Iowa perspective,\u201d King told RealClearPolitics. No candidate has won the Iowa caucuses while opposing the RFS. But Cruz was rigid. King recalled: \u201cTed said, \u2018Legislation I have sponsored or co-sponsored, I am going to stick to,\u2019\u201d referring to anti-RFS bills Cruz supported in 2013 and 2014.\n\nCruz kept his word, and many Iowans are offering a few choice words of their own in response. During a six-day bus tour across Iowa, with stops in 28 counties, the Texas senator faced a steady drumbeat of questions about his RFS stance. A pro-ethanol group, America\u2019s Renewable Future, distributed unflattering literature in his wake.\n\nOn the Cruz campaign bus, King tinkered with the language in Cruz\u2019s forthcoming renewable fuel plan, which he believed would clarify Cruz\u2019s RFS stance and make it more palatable to Iowans. And at events along the route, King tried to act as a legitimizing force for the freshman lawmaker, insisting to constituents that Cruz would not hold oil interests above their own.\n\nTo one concerned woman in Cherokee, Iowa, King gave his normal spiel \u2014 Cruz would eliminate all subsidies, not only phase out the RFS \u2014 before adding with mild exasperation: \u201cWould you really risk the presidency of the United States over\u201d this?\n\nCruz has wagered that that woman, and other Iowans like her, will not. It could be a stunning miscalculation \u2014 or it could be one example of how Cruz\u2019s patient, deliberate plan to win his party\u2019s nomination has gained traction.\n\nThe fundamentals are familiar to anyone who watched Cruz\u2019s insurgent campaign for Senate in Texas in 2012, in which he cast himself as a principled conservative fighter who would take on Washington.\n\nHe\u2019s hardly the first candidate to use such themes, but the underlying theory of Cruz\u2019s candidacy hinges on his belief that conservative Republicans are sick of settling for a GOP nominee more moderate than themselves. They\u2019ve done this, he believes, having been convinced by the Mitt Romneys and John McCains of the Republican world that it\u2019s the best way to defeat the Democrats in November. Cruz is telling them what many movement conservatives long to hear: that the most pragmatic approach is also the most principled.\n\n\"If conservatives unite, we win,\" Cruz says on the stump. \"In past elections, what Washington\u2019s tried to do was divide and splinter conservatives, and what we\u2019re seeing is, conservatives are uniting.\"\n\nHe has found a willing audience for this message. Late last year, a large coalition of conservative leaders, nicknamed \u201cThe GROUP\u201d and led by Tony Perkins of the Family Research Council, decided wholesale to support Cruz after he courted them heavily. A wave of announcements followed, including from Bob Vander Plaats of The Family Leader, based in Iowa. Vander Plaats joined Cruz on his bus tour through Iowa last week; James Dobson, founder of Focus on the Family, also made a cameo.\n\nMeanwhile, Cruz has methodically cultivated the grassroots \u2014 first in his Senate bid, and then through his fights in Congress, which included a gambit to defund the Affordable Care Act that culminated in a government shutdown. In the presidential race, Cruz has bragged about the bridges he has burned on Capitol Hill, often invoking a New York Times story from the time of his campaign launch, which downplayed his odds of winning his party\u2019s nomination because he lacked establishment support.\n\n\u201cI kinda thought that was the whole point of the campaign!\u201d he concludes with a flourish.\n\nNone of this is accidental. Cruz saw in this election cycle, and even earlier than that, what many other Republican candidates did not: that a candidate running farthest to the right would enjoy a wide-open field with the full base behind him \u2014especially in a large field.\n\nCruz has described four lanes in this presidential race: a moderate-establishment lane, which he would cede in the primary; a Tea Party lane, his natural home field; an evangelical Christian lane, where he could grow his support; and a libertarian lane, which most people initially conceded to Rand Paul but has also become Cruz territory to an extent.\n\n\u201cThe players that were expected to be formidable in those lanes have not got the traction they had hoped,\u201d Cruz said in an interview with Politico. \u201cThe most encouraging thing I would say is that I think three of the lanes are collapsing into one, which is the evangelical lane, the conservative Tea Party lane, and the libertarian lane are all collapsing into the conservative lane, and we\u2019re seeing those lanes unify behind our campaign.\u201d\n\nCruz has not often been reluctant to discuss his strategy, except in this story: his campaign did not grant an interview, nor did multiple aides respond to requests for comment.\n\nThis strategy is rooted in recent political history. Cruz worked as a policy adviser for George W. Bush\u2019s 2000 presidential campaign, when Bush ran as a Washington outsider from Texas with a strong appeal to evangelical Christians. Cruz has likely also taken some inspiration from Bush\u2019s 2004 re-election campaign, which used a \u201cbase strategy\u201d of appealing to and turning out the Republican Party\u2019s most fervent supporters.\n\nCruz\u2019s tack has been remarkably impervious to changing political winds, or perhaps predictive of them \u2014 so much so that whole chunks of his stump speech remain the same.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here to tell you, I\u2019m incredibly optimistic,\u201d Cruz said during a 2009 campaign for state attorney general he would later abandon. \u201c... The reason I\u2019m so incredibly optimistic is, we are witnessing an awakening across the state of Texas, across our nation.\u201d\n\nHis stump speech today incorporates that line almost verbatim, with Cruz\u2019s self-identified optimism and his sense of an \u201cawakening\u201d featuring prominently.\n\nCruz uttered the line during his first stop on last week\u2019s bus tour, a small Christian bookstore in Boone, Iowa, where people pressed up against bookshelves and each other for a glimpse of the candidate. The venue choice was politically transparent, a play for the evangelical voters Cruz has been courting here.\n\n\u201cScripture tells us there\u2019s nothing new under the sun,\u201d Cruz told the crowd there. \u201cI think where we are today is very, very much like the late 1970s. Same failed economic policies, same misery, stagnation and malaise.\u201d But Cruz was optimistic, he insisted, \u201cbecause we know how that story ended.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll across this country, millions of men and women rose up and became the Reagan Revolution,\u201d he added. \u201cWhy am I so optimistic? Because the same thing is happening again, because conservatives are uniting and coming together, because the American people are rising up.\u201d\n\nAs part of his own rise, Cruz speaks about religion in more overtly personal terms than he did earlier in his career. At an evangelical rally in Fort Worth, Texas, in June 2012, Cruz spoke of religion only in legal terms \u2014 the cases he had argued before the Supreme Court, the constitutional right to religious liberty. The crowd responded favorably, but the style bore little resemblance to how Cruz talks today. Across Iowa he explicitly quotes the Bible and speaks of faith in deeply personal terms.\n\nJust two months after being sworn in to the Senate, Cruz invited CBN News, a Christian network, to his home in Houston, where they filmed him quoting the book of Proverbs to his family at the dinner table.\n\n\"Anyone in politics, you've got a special obligation to avoid being a Pharisee, to avoid ostentatiously wrapping yourself in your faith,\" Cruz said in that interview. \"Because I think in politics, it's too easy for that to become a crutch, for that to be politically useful.\"\n\nBy July 2013, CBN was sitting down in Des Moines with Rafael Cruz, Ted Cruz\u2019s father and a pastor. Rafael Cruz had traveled to Iowa with his son for a meeting of pastors at the Marriott downtown, which marked Ted Cruz\u2019s first trip to test the waters in the Hawkeye State. Vander Plaats, one of Cruz\u2019s key endorsements in this election, also attended that meeting.\n\nRafael Cruz\u2019s appearance was what Iowa Republican operatives have described since as a long, calculated charm offensive targeting the faith community in Iowa and ingratiating them toward his son.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s spent years on the ground doing what some campaigns have tried to do this year,\u201d said one strategist for a rival campaign in Iowa. \u201cHe pretty much moved in here and became the trusting voice for them.\u201d\n\nWhen Ted Cruz kicked off his presidential campaign in March 2013, he sent a clear signal to that tirelessly cultivated network by selecting Jerry Falwell\u2019s Liberty University as his launching pad. Rafael Cruz has remained a key figure, actively campaigning for his son and showcasing his religious credentials on the trail, while acting as a top campaign adviser behind the scenes.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got a major role,\u201d said Pastor Rob Ely, a county co-chair for Cruz in Iowa, \u201cmostly with helping to educate pastors and faith leaders on what our role should be in the whole process and how we can have a major impact. Part of the whole game plan is to really mobilize evangelicals and Christians.\u201d\n\nCruz encouraged his supporters in Iowa last week \u201cto awaken and energize the body of Christ\u201d in mobilizing voters.\n\nOver the course of a few years, Cruz positioned himself well for this election cycle to outflank and out-organize every candidate on the right. But then Trump happened, and that was never part of the plan.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t strategize around Trump,\u201d King said. \u201cHe\u2019s a complete political anomaly, and strategizing around him has essentially come up short.\u201d\n\nCruz and his allies appear to be trying, however. A message-testing call in Iowa on Monday floated seven potential attacks against Trump, from his faith to his party loyalty, asking the listener whether each would make them more or less likely to support Trump. Other questions about Cruz\u2019s approval pointed to his supporters having organized the poll.\n\nIf Cruz has captured the Tea Party zeal of a few years ago, Trump has hit on something new: a populist streak within the Republican Party that is surprisingly strong, if not ideologically pure.\n\nMeanwhile, as Cruz insists he has united conservative voters, three conservative candidates \u2014 Ben Carson, Rick Santorum, and Mike Huckabee \u2014 still threaten to undercut his base in Iowa. Huckabee and Santorum have each won the Iowa caucuses, in 2008 and 2012 respectively, and Carson was the frontrunner there for a period last year.\n\n\u201cIf they can slow (Cruz\u2019s) momentum,\u201d King said, \u201cthen I expect Trump will do well.\u201d\n\nOther campaigns aren\u2019t betting on it.\n\n\u201c(Cruz\u2019s) team has worked for months to consolidate the evangelical vote into his camp, and those efforts have largely worked,\u201d said Tim Albrecht, an Iowa Republican strategist advising Jeb Bush\u2019s campaign. \u201cThe real story would be if he didn\u2019t win the state, a scenario which seems highly unlikely at this point.\u201d\n\nAnd Iowa is only one piece of the Cruz master plan \u2014 the beginning, not the endgame. \u201cIt\u2019s been a national strategy from the beginning,\u201d King said.\n\nFor King, watching that strategy play out has been reaffirming, at least so far.\n\n\u201cI bought into something,\u201d King added, \u201cthat was better than I thought it would be.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "SIOUX CENTER, Iowa \u2014 In the early stages of Ted Cruz\u2019s campaign for president, his ally, Republican Rep.
