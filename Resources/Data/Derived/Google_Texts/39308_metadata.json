If he has a political philosophy at all, it is plutocratic hypocrisy. He inherited a fortune, used American capitalism to turn that into mega-wealth and now lectures everyone else that we need the government to take care of us.\n\nHe announced he will \u201c\u2026take care of everybody\u2026\u201d promising that \u201c\u2026the government\u2019s gonna pay for it.\u201d\n\nPutting aside the implications of \"TrumpCare\" for our taxes, economic growth and the national debt, the implications for conservatism are deadly.\n\nThe Republican presidential primary is being dominated by someone who agrees with Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton about the defining domestic policy issue of our time.\n\nThe problem is this: Donald Trump is not a conservative. If he has a political philosophy at all, it is plutocratic hypocrisy. He inherited a fortune, used American capitalism to turn that into mega-wealth and now lectures everyone else that we need the government to take care of us.\n\nThe danger is, if he persuades Americans that government controlled health care is acceptable, he will have opened the door for a nanny state and made the Republican Party irrelevant.\n\nIt would hand the Left a rationale for interference in every aspect of our lives. If government pays for your health care, they will claim it should have a say in your lifestyle: whether you smoke or drink, your salt and sugar intake, how you exercise and even whether you own a firearm. It would be former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg\u2019s big gulp campaign -- supersized.\n\nSince our country\u2019s founding, the bulwark against socialism\u2019s empty promises and this kind of state control, has been the good sense of the American people and the steel spines of conservatives.\n\nYet almost eight years of the Obama presidency and the passage of ObamaCare has put that defense in jeopardy. Not because Democrats are suddenly winning the argument, but because Republicans have stopped fighting.\n\nThe Washington establishment is telling us that we must accept a \u2018post-ObamaCare reality,' that the government should ensure coverage for every American.\n\nNow the establishment is enabling Donald Trump with their silence and making him think his position is acceptable.\n\nEven conservative senators like Ted Cruz are complicit. He has distinguished himself by praising Trump\u2019s positions and clinging to his events, in the hope of picking up his votes when he eventually fades.\n\nHe and others are putting short term political expedience above principle.\n\nPerhaps this explains why I am the only presidential candidate to have published an alternative to ObamaCare. The reason no one else has done it is because they have no intention of actually repealing and replacing the law.\n\nBut if they won\u2019t do it, I will.\n\nMy plan removes the individual and employer mandates, lowers costs through price transparency for consumers and allows providers to compete in open markets.\n\nIt rescinds every single word of ObamaCare and replaces it with a free-market alternative.\n\nIt represents a return to the principles of liberty and self-reliance for which conservatism has long stood.\n\nHealth care policy on the Right determines whether we will simply be cheaper Democrats, offering a cost-effective version of their world view, or whether we represent a truly alternative vision for the future.\n\nIf we capitulate on this issue, we lose our rationale as a political force. This is conservatism\u2019s last redoubt. Health care is our Alamo.\n\nIt will either be the gateway through which the forces of corruption and socialism ride, or it will become emblematic of the conservative revolution which takes back our country.\n\nTexans like to tell the tale of Colonel Travis drawing a line in the sand before the battle. He asked his men to choose to defend something worth fighting for, or flee.\n\nToday, I\u2019m offering Republicans the same choice. The good senator from the great state of Texas can be conservatism\u2019s modern day Moses Rose and quietly sneak out the back door, or he can denounce Donald Trump and stand with conservatives.\n\nIn turn, conservative voters have a responsibility to declare that anyone who supports single payer health care has no place in our movement.\n\nMake no mistake, this is no side issue.\n\nThe road to liberalism\u2019s false utopia is built on territory ceded by conservatives. To halt its advance, we must embrace our own principles and nominate a candidate who is intellectually and morally capable of standing their ground.\n\nIt is time for Republicans to pick a side of the line. It is time for conservatives to say that the circus is over. It is time to Dump Trump.\n\nRepublican Bobby Jindal is governor of Louisiana and a former Republican candidate for president of the United States.", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/EXECUTIVE/Health care", "dcterms.modified": "2015-10-01 04:04:55 EDT", "dcterms.abstract": "I am the only presidential candidate to have published an alternative to ObamaCare.", "twitter": {"description": "I am the only presidential candidate to have published an alternative to ObamaCare.", "creator": "@foxnews", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/01/donald-trump-doesnt-get-it-health-care-is-our-alamo.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/opinion/2015/10/01/donald-trump-doesnt-get-it-health-care-is-our-alamo/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1443717916306.jpg?ve=1", "title": "Jindal: Donald Trump doesn't get it.
