It\u2019s winning and learning and that\u2019s all we\u2019re trying to do.\u201d\n\nTyler Ulis put Kentucky ahead with a 3-pointer deep in double overtime to help hold off Texas A&M for the 70-64 win.\n\nThe game was tied at 63 when Ulis hit the shot with 1:26 left for his first points of the game.\n\nKentucky (15-0, 2-0 SEC) was coming off an overtime win against Mississippi on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThese kids are not machines,\u201d Calipari said. \u201cThey make mistakes. They do dumb things, but I\u2019ve got a good group that has a will to win.\u201d\n\nThe Aggies rallied in the final minutes to tie it in regulation. Trey Lyles made two foul shots with six seconds left in the first overtime for Kentucky, and Texas A&M took its time before missing a long 3 at the buzzer.\n\nDown 66-63, Kourtney Roberson made one of two free throws for Texas A&M (9-5, 0-2 SEC) before a turnover by Lyles gave the Aggies the ball back with 26.9 seconds left.\n\nDanuel House missed a 3-pointer with 16 seconds left and Dakari Johnson made two free throws for Kentucky. House finished with 25 points.\n\nJohnson wasn\u2019t surprised that Texas A&M gave them such a fight.\n\n\u201cWe know that this is every team\u2019s Super Bowl and everybody is going to give us their best shot,\u201d he said.\n\nDevin Booker led Kentucky with 18 points, Aaron Harrison had 12 and Andrew Harrison had nine. Three players fouled out for Kentucky and one for the Aggies.\n\nKentucky trailed by as many as 11 in the first half before a big run just before halftime and at the beginning of the second half put the Wildcats on top.\n\nThe Aggies didn\u2019t score a basket in the first overtime, but made four of six free throws to stay in it. The Wildcats got a bucket from Booker and missed three free throws before Lyles\u2019 tying foul shots.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m crushed that we didn\u2019t win \u2026 but I\u2019m proud of the way we competed and gave ourselves a chance to win,\u201d Texas A&M coach Billy Kennedy said.\n\nHouse made a pair of free throws to tie it with 18.4 seconds left in regulation. The Wildcats had a chance to win it in regulation, but a long 3-pointer by Aaron Harrison bounced off the rim.\n\nThe Aggies used a 5-2 run to cut the lead to 53-51 with 1 1/2 minutes left. They got the ball back and missed three shots on one possession before Kentucky grabbed a rebound and Andrew Harrison\u2019s layup on the other end rolled in and out of the basket before the free throws by House.\n\nTexas A&M scored five consecutive points, with two layups by House, to get within 48-46 with five minutes left. But Aaron Harrison sunk a 3 to extend Kentucky\u2019s lead to 5.\n\nThe Aggies played without leading scorer Jalen Jones, who has been averaging 12.1 points a game) who missed his second consecutive game with a sprained ankle.\n\nBooker scored five consecutive points for the Wildcats before Alex Robinson made Texas A&M\u2019s first field goal in 6 1/2 minutes on a layup about a minute later to cut the lead to 39-35.\n\nThe Wildcats scored the first four points of the second half to cap a 12-0 run that started before halftime and take their first lead of the game 29-28.\n\nTexas A&M jumped out to a 9-0 lead as Kentucky missed its first seven shots thanks in part to two blocks. The Wildcats finally got on the board on a 3-pointer by Booker with 14:40 left in the first half.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Kentucky coach John Calipari repeated over and over again that his team isn't very good, yet it showed so otherwise on Saturday by eking out a 70-64 victory at Texas A&M.", "Author": "Kristie Rieken", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Kentucky coach John Calipari repeated over and over again that his team isn\u2019t very good, yet it showed so otherwise on Saturday by eking out a 70-64 victory at Texas A&M.", "title": "Tyler Ulis\u2019 3-pointer helps No. 1 Kentucky hold off Texas A&M in double overtime", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jan/10/tyler-ulis-late-3-pointer-helps-no-1-kentucky-hold/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/10/87e4ed1ca086dd016a0f6a7067003320.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/10/87e4ed1ca086dd016a0f6a7067003320.jpg", "title": "Tyler Ulis\u2019 3-pointer helps No. 1 Kentucky hold off Texas A&M in", "description": "Kentucky coach John Calipari repeated over and over again that his team isn't very good, yet it showed so otherwise on Saturday by eking out a 70-64 victory at Texas A&M.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Sports, Texas A M, John Calipari"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde22f\"", "article_summary": "COLLEGE STATION, Texas \u2014 Kentucky coach John Calipari repeated the same thing again and again after his top-ranked team remained undefeated with a double-overtime victory against Texas A&M on Saturday.\nThe Aggies didn\u2019t score a basket in the first overtime, but made four of six free throws to stay in it.\nTexas A&M jumped out to a 9-0 lead as Kentucky missed its first seven shots thanks in part to two blocks.\nIt\u2019s winning and learning and that\u2019s all we\u2019re trying to do.\u201dTyler Ulis put Kentucky ahead with a 3-pointer deep in double overtime to help hold off Texas A&M for the 70-64 win.\nDanuel House missed a 3-pointer with 16 seconds left and Dakari Johnson made two free throws for Kentucky."}
