Jeb Bush has money but has been out of the game for a while, and also loves immigration reform and Common Core. Chris Christie \u2026 something about a bridge? Ted Cruz has what we may call a narrow, if vociferous, appeal, even among Republicans. Rand Paul doesn\u2019t love constant war enough; Marco Rubio is nothing. As we all know, Romneymentum is sweeping the country with a fervor unlike anything previously recorded in political history, but for whatever reason, he seems intent on not giving it another go.\n\nThis is all great news for Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker! Walker has everything Republicans want in a presidential nominee. Executive experience. A record of right-wing accomplishment in a blue state and fighting hard to save his hide in the backlash. And most important, a diverse coalition of supporters, ranging from white suburbanites to white suburbanites, and then back to white suburbanites again.\n\nThe New Republic\u2019s Alec MacGillis writes about Walker at length in the magazine\u2019s latest cover story. And it shows, at least to us, that Walker represents a great test of the crumbling national GOP foundation\u2019s ability to push through a presidential victory. If he\u2019s able to become president, the reconfigured appeal the GOP needs to be nationally competitive again will at least be delayed. If he isn\u2019t, then the party may learn once and for all that time\u2019s up.\n\nWalker\u2019s base is a lot like that of Republicans in other states: whiter rural and suburban parts that go to battle with more heavily African-American and Hispanic cities. As MacGillis explains, though, the racial imbalance in Wisconsin, specifically in and around Milwaukee, is almost total. \u201cToday, less than 2 percent of the WOW counties\u2019 population,\u201d MacGillis writes of the three most populous counties surrounding Milwaukee, \u201cis African American and less than 5 percent is Hispanic. According to studies by the Brookings Institution and Brown University, the Milwaukee metro area is one of the top two most racially segregated regions in the country.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new profile shows just how homogeneous the Wisconsin governor's support is.
