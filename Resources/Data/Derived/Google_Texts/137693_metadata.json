Many doctors just don\u2019t get too involved handling the business side of their practices.\n\nBut no one seems to know for sure how much, if anything, will be paid on outstanding claims.\n\nA survey of nearly 800 N.Y. physicians conducted last week by the Medical Society of the State of New York found that more than 80 percent say Health Republic hasn\u2019t provided them with clear information about the implications of the company\u2019s shut down. And the insolvent insurance company owes N.Y. doctors \u201cat least tens of millions of dollars,\u201d the Medical Society said today. Forty-three percent of doctors statewide have outstanding claims to Health Republic\u2014 some in the millions of dollars.\n\nA firm has been hired \u201cto manage the wind-down\u201d of Health Republic\u2019s operations and the co-op\u2019s financial consultants are hopeful that modest payments on outstanding claims may be made at some point in the future,\u201d according New York\u2019s deputy secretary for health and human services, Paul Francis.\n\nMeanwhile, the state insists that providers remain legally obligated to continue to provide care to Health Republic subscribers and are prohibited by law from \u201cbalance billing\u201d \u2014 holding subscribers responsible for amounts unpaid by the insurance carrier.\n\nComplicating matters further is the unclear status of Health Republic\u2019s provider network, which has patients, doctors and hospitals all wondering whether Health Republic\u2019s subscribers actually have health insurance through the end of this month, when the insurance carrier shuts down as ordered by the state.\n\nHealth Republic was the largest of 23 nonprofit co-ops (\u201cconsumer operated and oriented plans\u201d) established under Obamacare in 2014 to increase competition and provide more affordable health insurance. The federal government backed the co-ops with $2 billion in loans. So far, nine of the 23 \u2014 including Health Republic\u2014 have failed.\n\nHealth Republic established a robust provider network by entering a contract with MagnaCare, an existing traditional insurance company doing business in New York and New Jersey.\n\nBut after the state Department of Financial Services deemed the co-op insolvent and on Sept. 25 announced it had ordered Health Republic to cease writing new policies on Dec. 31, MagnaCare, whose participating providers were seeing their unpaid claims mount, terminated its contract with Health Republic on Oct. 19, effective Nov. 18.\n\nOn Nov. 6, MagnaCare informed its participating providers that \u201call claim payments will cease immediately,\u201d as per a Nov. 5 letter from Francis to MagnaCare CEO Joseph Berado.\n\nThe health official\u2019s letter \u201calso sets forth the State\u2019s position on a provider\u2019s obligation to comply with NY state laws regarding balance billing of members and continuity or transition of care,\u201d MagnaCare said in its Nov. 6 letter to providers.\n\n\u201cThe State has directed MagnaCare to keep this network in place until the end of November,\u201d Berado wrote.\n\nSome doctors fearing payment of \u201cpennies on the dollar\u201d are telling patients they must pay for services out-of-pocket, according to reports RiverheadLOCAL has collected from six different Health Republic customers \u2014 including one who has seen the same Nassau County physician for more than 20 years.\n\nOthers say they will continue to provide care, even though they know they won\u2019t be paid for it.\n\n\u201cMany of the practitioners are out a lot of money,\u201d Riverhead pulmonologist Dr. Rajesh Patel said. \u201cI will just go ahead and see them. If I don\u2019t get paid, I don\u2019t get paid,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat else can I do? They are my patients.\u201d\n\nInternist Dr. John O\u2019Connor, who owns North Shore Medical Care in Calverton, echoed Patel\u2019s sentiments.\n\n\u201cWhat can you do? Say no? I can\u2019t do that as a human being,\u201d O\u2019Connor said in an interview Monday night. \u201cYou have to do the right thing.\u201d\n\nAs a primary care provider, O\u2019Connor said he is already stretched to the max financially and fears the demise of Health Republic, which will cost his practice a significant amount of money, will be the straw that breaks the camel\u2019s back.\n\n\u201cThere will be no guys like me left when all is said and done,\u201d he said. \u201cSince the new year, there have been 20 physicians that I know of that have left the area in a 25-mile radius. A few more guys are waiting to go.\u201d\n\nA few years ago, when a government computer error put his name in the Medicare provider database three times \u2014 \u201cI\u2019ve been practicing in the same place with the same name for 15 years\u201d \u2014 his reimbursements were frozen for six months, while the government fixed their mistake.\n\n\u201cI had to borrow $40,000 to stay afloat,\u201d he said. \u201cI still haven\u2019t been able to pay it back.\u201d\n\nHe finds himself putting money from his personal savings into the business to make payroll.\n\nHe\u2019s also worried he\u2019ll need to increase his payroll to be able to meet new medical coding requirements \u2014 there are 76,000 new billing codes, he said. \u201cDo it wrong, you don\u2019t get paid. Worse, you will be fined. I\u2019ll have to hire someone just to take care of that. And I can\u2019t afford it.\u201d\n\nEvery new year brings with it the need for more financial juggling, as Medicare deductibles have to be paid before reimbursements come in. That regularly requires hitting the business line of credit during the first three months of the year. Not in 2016.\n\n\u201cBanks have erased all lines of credit for physicians,\u201d O\u2019Connor said. \u201cIf I don\u2019t get paid for Health Republic, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll be out of business,\u201d he said, obviously distraught.\n\n\u201cDo you know what that feels like?\u201d asked O\u2019Connor, who is the father of two young children.\n\n\u201cThis was an epic fail. You could predict this,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd this is just the beginning.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Doctors stand to lose tens of millions of dollars in the wake of the shutdown of insolvent health insurance co-op, Medical Society survey finds.", "wot-verification": "15191109ecd7f772357e", "og": {"site_name": "RiverheadLOCAL", "description": "Doctors stand to lose tens of millions of dollars in the wake of the shutdown of insolvent health insurance co-op, Medical Society survey finds.", "title": "Health Republic shutdown: Doctors, hospitals face huge losses", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 500, "identifier": "http://riverheadlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2015_1117_doctors_room.jpg", "height": 333}, "updated_time": "2015-11-18T05:32:47-04:00", "url": "http://riverheadlocal.com/2015/11/17/health-care-providers-face-staggering-losses-in-wake-of-insurance-companys-demise-some-fear-for-survival/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://riverheadlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2015_1117_doctors_room.jpg", "description": "Doctors stand to lose tens of millions of dollars in the wake of the shutdown of insolvent health insurance co-op, Medical Society survey finds.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Health Republic shutdown: Doctors, hospitals face huge losses"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 10155830199385492, "app_id": 105130769527571}, "google-site-verification": "M6EraiexRI8YB8fDKzJbnztQ2_4haJxd0OvUC4dVIcE", "article": {"publisher": "http://facebook.com/riverheadlocal2", "section": "Health", "tag": "Peconic Bay Medical Center", "published_time": "2015-11-17T19:53:39-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-18T05:32:47-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=1220"}, "article_summary": "Forty-three percent of doctors statewide have outstanding claims to Health Republic\u2014 some in the millions of dollars.\nHealth Republic was the largest of 23 nonprofit co-ops (\u201cconsumer operated and oriented plans\u201d) established under Obamacare in 2014 to increase competition and provide more affordable health insurance.\nDoctors are either reluctant to discuss how the shutdown of Health Republic by state regulators will impact them financially \u2014 or they just don\u2019t know.\n\u201cIf I don\u2019t get paid for Health Republic, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll be out of business,\u201d he said, obviously distraught.\nSo far, nine of the 23 \u2014 including Health Republic\u2014 have failed."}
