Burwell. The brief, co-authored by the National Latina Institute for Reproductive Health (NLIRH) and the Reproductive Justice Clinic at New York University (NYU) School of Law, asks the Court to uphold the contraceptive coverage accommodation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Equality opponents are seeking to remove this vital component of the landmark act to further control the reprodhttp://lgbtweekly.com/wp-admin/post-new.phpuctive health care choices of millions of Americans.\n\n\u201cA Supreme Court decision that allows discrimination under the guise of \u2018religious freedom\u2019 would drastically restrict the ability of LGBTQ people to control our reproductive health and sexual lives. Many of us, including cisgender women, transgender men, intersex and gender non-conforming people, can get pregnant and rely on a full range of reproductive health options, including birth control, in order to make the best decisions for ourselves,\u201d said Rea Carey, National LGBTQ Task Force Executive Director.\n\nCurrently, the ACA requires health insurance plans to cover birth control at no cost\u2014and also allows religiously affiliated employers and for-profit corporations with closely-held beliefs like Hobby Lobby to opt out if they submit a form stating their religious objection. But a group of employers say the form itself violates their religious beliefs because their employees can still get birth control through a third party.\n\nIf the Supreme Court were to decide against protecting access to birth control, or allow the lower court\u2019s decision to stand, it would establish a legal precedent that would have broader and more alarming implications. For example, if an employer can refuse to cover contraceptives because of religious beliefs, they could also use religion to refuse to cover other vital health care such as HIV/AIDS medication and PrEP.\n\nThe additional organizations that signed-on to the brief include: ACT for Women and Girls, Advocates for Youth, Black Women\u2019s Health Imperative, California Latinas for Reproductive Justice, Casa de Esperanza, Center on Reproductive Rights and Justice at the University of California, Berkeley, School of Law, Colorado Organization for Latina Opportunity and Reproductive Rights (COLOR), Desiree Alliance, Farmworker Justice, In Our Own Voice: National Black Women\u2019s Reproductive Justice Agenda, LatinoJustice PRLDEF, Law Students for Reproductive Justice, MANA, A National Latina Organization, National Advocates for Pregnant Women, National Asian Pacific American Women\u2019s Forum (NAPAWF), National Center for Lesbian Rights (NCLR), National Network of Abortion Funds, Northwest Health Law Advocates, Oregon Foundation for Reproductive Health, SisterLove, Inc., SisterReach, SisterSong National Women Of Color Reproductive Justice Collective, SPARK Reproductive Justice Now!, URGE: Unite for Reproductive & Gender Equity, Voto Latino, Women With A Vision, Inc (WWAV) and WV FREE.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "lgbtq task force,amicus brief,zubik v. burwell,gay,lgbt,", "og": {"site_name": "LGBT Weekly", "description": "WASHINGTON, D.C. \u2014The National LGBTQ Task Force has joined 28 other local and national LGBTQ rights,\u00a0civil rights,\u00a0youth advocacy, and reproductive health, rights and justice organizations in filing an\u00a0amicus brief\u00a0in support of respondents in Zubik v.
