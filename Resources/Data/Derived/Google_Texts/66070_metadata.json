This is a necessary feature in ACA, because if qualified individuals or families had to pay the full cost of health insurance up front, many would be unable to make the required health insurance payments each month.\n\nAccording to HHS\u2019s Office of Inspector General, in 2014 there weren\u2019t any solid mechanisms in place to ensure the subsidy payments made to health insurance companies were legally made. As The Wall Street Journal reported on January 6, 2016, \u201cthe [Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which is responsible for overseeing ACA,] couldn\u2019t verify the payments to insurers were only for consumers who had paid their premiums.\u201d\n\nWith no way to verify subsidy payments were properly made, it was virtually impossible for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to prevent fraud and waste, two problems that have plagued Obamacare since it was first implemented.\n\nKristina Ribali, senior coalitions director for the Foundation for Government Accountability (FGA), reported for The Blaze an investigation in July 2015 revealed \u201cdefrauding Obamacare was still very easy.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith a fake name and fake documents, the investigators were able to receive both insurance coverage and taxpayer subsidies, a year after they proved the first time that this fraud was achievable,\u201d wrote Ribali.\n\nRibali also recounted in her article how nearly $350 million in Obamacare tax credits had been overpaid by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) by early 2015, and Ribali reported back in August 2015 ACA made it virtually impossible to retrieve the lost cash.\n\nWhat is disturbing is not that another massive government-created social program is irresponsible with taxpayer money \u2013 a problem present in virtually every federal program \u2013 it\u2019s that the Obama administration was well aware of these problems at least as early as 2013 and chose to move forward knowing millions were likely going to be wasted or stolen.\n\nIn December 2013, Rachael Bade and Lauren French reported for Politico, \u201c[T]he [IRS] may not yet have a system in place to stop tax cheats seeking to underestimate their incomes and fraudulently cash in on health subsidies.\u201d\n\nBade and French quote directly from a Treasury Department report on the possibility of fraud, \u201cThe ACA Program has not yet completed a fraud mitigation strategy. It is important for the IRS to thoroughly consider fraud threats and risks that could impact new ACA systems.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately for taxpayers, the necessary changes made to the \u201cACA systems\u201d didn\u2019t take place until it was too late. Only now are automated systems being put into place that will prevent a significant amount of fraud and waste.\n\nWhile it\u2019s impossible to know how much money was wasted and how much of the taxpayer subsidies paid to insurance companies in 2014 was legitimate, it\u2019s important to note in 2014 HHS found 1.2 million people who signed up for health insurance in an Obamacare exchange had, as FoxNews.com reported in August 2014, \u201cinconsistencies in their applications.\u201d\n\nFoxNews.com also reported the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) claimed 85 percent of Obamacare applicants were considered eligible for some sort of taxpayer subsidy, which KFF estimated would cost \u201cabout $10 billion in subsidies in [2014].\u201d Now that we know the total cost actually reached $11 billion, it\u2019s necessary to ask, \u201cWhere did the rest of the money go?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to say whether the $1 billion difference between KFF\u2019s report in 2014 and the actual costs revealed in 2015 is the result of fraud, mismanagement, improper payments, waste, or just mistakes made by KFF and other groups calculating costs. There simply weren\u2019t any mechanisms in place to prevent or identify the waste. We do know, however, that at the very least hundreds of millions of dollars were wasted, that fraud was possible and did occur, and that the Obama administration moved forward with the Obamacare system knowing in 2013 it had no way of protecting taxpayers\u2019 money.\n\nFGA reports 5 to 25 percent of state welfare spending is fraudulent or wasted, which is why FGA launched its \u201cStop the Scam\u201d program (STS) to help states fight the fraud the federal government is unwilling or unable to control. STS \u201cembraces advances in technology and e-verify software to allow states to verify applicants are truly eligible for welfare benefits, monitor welfare enrollees to ensure they are still eligible to receive benefits, and prosecute welfare fraudsters who steal from taxpayers.\u201d\n\nAccording to FGA, STS has saved $350 million annually in Illinois and $300 million in Pennsylvania in that state\u2019s first year implementing the program.\n\n\u201cState lawmakers have a duty to protect scarce taxpayer resources and verify that those receiving Medicaid benefits are in fact actually eligible,\u201d Ribali told Consumer Power Report in an interview. \u201cBy adopting our bi-partisan Stop the Scam initiative, states can use enhanced technology to verify applicants, monitor welfare enrollees, and prosecute scammers who rob from taxpayers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a proven program, that if adopted nationwide could save taxpayers as much as $8 billion annually,\u201d Ribali said.\n\nThe decision to move forward with the Obamacare exchanges without proper safeguards in place is reminiscent of the Obama administration\u2019s decision to open the Healthcare.gov website even though it knew the site was woefully unprepared to begin its operations. In the end, politics was more important than preparedness and protecting Americans\u2019 hard-earned cash.\n\nIt\u2019s time states do what the Obamacare administration is unable or unwilling to do: enact programs similar to FGA\u2019s Stop the Scam initiative to ensure taxpayer money is being spent responsibly.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in learning more about the Foundation for Government Accountability\u2019s Stop the Scam program, visit FGA\u2019s website: http://thefga.org/solutions/welfare-reform/stop-fraud/.\n\n-- Justin Haskins\n\nIN THIS ISSUE:\n\nFTC, DOJ TELL SOUTH CAROLINA IT SHOULD REPEAL SOME CERTIFICATE OF NEED REGULATIONS\n\nThe federal government has recommended South Carolina repeal requirements that health facilities get state permission for many kinds of construction and expansion, backing up something Gov. Nikki Haley has sought for years. In a letter and attached statement to Haley, who sought officials\u2019 opinion in November, the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission wrote that laws requiring something known as a certificate of need impede competition and make such projects more expensive. South Carolina\u2019s certificate of need program nearly died in 2013 when Haley vetoed its $2 million in funding, saying then that such decisions were best left to the open market. The program was resurrected a year later when, after a lawsuit from hospitals, the S.C. Supreme Court ruled it couldn\u2019t be eliminated unless lawmakers directly voted to kill it.\n\nSOURCE: By Meg Kinnard, Associated Press\n\nHILLARY CLINTON ATTACK SANDERS\u2019 PLAN FOR NATIONAL SINGLE-PAYER HEALTH CARE SYSTEM\n\nHillary Clinton attacked Bernie Sanders\u2019 health care plan during a campaign stop in northeast Iowa on Monday, as the race for the Democratic nomination here continues to tighten. \u201cWe had enough of a fight just to get to the Affordable Care Act,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to rip it up and start over, but I sure don\u2019t want to turn over health care to Republican governors, for heaven\u2019s sake.\u201d Sanders, who was campaigning 140 miles away in Perry, has proposed a \u201cMedicare for all,\u201d universal healthcare system that he says is long overdue in the United States. Clinton, who says she wants to improve the Affordable Care Act by bringing out of pocket costs down, called his plan a \u201crisky deal.\u201d \u201cIt could hurt more than help American families,\u201d she said.\n\nSOURCE: By Hannah Fraser-Chanpong, CBS News\">\n\n\n\n\n\nLEGISLATORS BATTLE IN MINNESOTA OVER MOVING STATE HEALTH INSURANCE EXCHANGE TO FEDERAL HEALTHCARE.GOV\n\nA subcommittee of a state task force recommended Monday continuing with a state-run health insurance exchange like MNsure for now, rather than transferring Minnesotans to the national exchange called HealthCare.gov Moving to the federal website would be costly and wouldn\u2019t work with the state\u2019s MinnesotaCare insurance program, said a report endorsed by the 11-person subcommittee of the state task force on health care finance. Plus, by moving to HealthCare.gov, the state would lose control over its network of health insurance navigators that help people enroll in coverage, according to the report. \u201cThe committee overwhelmingly voted not to move to HealthCare.gov at this point,\u201d said chairwoman Lynn Blewett, who is a health care researcher at the University of Minnesota. The recommendations will be taken up Friday by the full Health Care Financing Task Force, which the Legislature created last May. The task force will decide what changes in Minnesota\u2019s insurance marketplace get proposed to the Legislature this year. Early last year, Republicans in the state House proposed a switch to the federal website in response to continued struggles with MNsure, which Minnesota launched in 2013 to implement the federal Affordable Care Act.\n\nSOURCE: By Christopher Snowbeck, Minneapolis Star Tribune\n\nKENTUCKY MOVES AHEAD WITH PLANS TO DISMANTLE HEALTH EXCHANGE\n\nKentucky\u2019s new Republican administration is moving forward with plans to shut down the state\u2019s health insurance exchange, becoming the first state to cut ties with one of the key pieces of President Barack Obama\u2019s signature healthcare law because of a political promise. Gov. Matt Bevin notified federal officials in a letter dated Dec. 30 that the state exchange will cease operations \u201cas soon as is practicable.\u201d That will be at least a year from now, according to federal law. It will not affect health plans sold for 2016. Kentucky is one of 14 states that run their own state health insurance exchanges. More than 100,000 people have used Kentucky\u2019s exchange, dubbed kynect, to purchase private health insurance plans with the help of a federal subsidy since it was implemented in 2013.\n\nSOURCE: Associated Press", "article_metadata": {}, "article_summary": "Although most tax credits are applied at the end of a tax year, Obamacare health insurance credits are sent automatically to health insurance companies when qualified Americans sign up for a policy through an Obamacare exchange.\nThis is a necessary feature in ACA, because if qualified individuals or families had to pay the full cost of health insurance up front, many would be unable to make the required health insurance payments each month.\nThe recommendations will be taken up Friday by the full Health Care Financing Task Force, which the Legislature created last May.\nKentucky is one of 14 states that run their own state health insurance exchanges.\nSOURCE: By Meg Kinnard, Associated PressHILLARY CLINTON ATTACK SANDERS\u2019 PLAN FOR NATIONAL SINGLE-PAYER HEALTH CARE SYSTEMHillary Clinton attacked Bernie Sanders\u2019 health care plan during a campaign stop in northeast Iowa on Monday, as the race for the Democratic nomination here continues to tighten."}
