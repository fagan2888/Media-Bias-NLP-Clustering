Editor’s Note: This blog has been cross-posted from The White House Blog, which on May 18 announced the launch of President Obama’s Twitter account: @POTUS.

Today, with a tweet from the Oval Office, President Obama launched @POTUS , the official Twitter account of the President of the United States.

The @POTUS Twitter account will serve as a new way for President Obama to engage directly with the American people, with tweets coming exclusively from him. President Obama is committed to making his Administration the most open and participatory in history, and @POTUS will give Americans a new venue to engage on the issues that matter most to them.
