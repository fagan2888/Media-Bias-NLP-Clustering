STEAMBOAT SPRINGS, Colo.—While many were glued to the AFC championship game, participants in Steamboat Springs’ annual ice fishing tournament were waiting patiently for some bites.

More than 80 people participated in Sunday’s tournament at Stagecoach Reservoir. They had six hours to catch fish and present their longest two catches to judges.

The Steamboat Pilot ( http://bit.ly/1f5Wni6) reports that some talked about Broncos football and rode snowmobiles and all-terrain vehicles when the fish weren’t biting.

Justin Nott of Steamboat won first place with a combined catch of 38.5 inches of trout, including the tournament’s only 20-incher.
