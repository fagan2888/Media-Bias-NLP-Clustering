But later that day, Mr. Kott found Quinn \u2014 a friendly, energetic athlete \u2014 on the bathroom floor. His speech was garbled.\n\n\u201cWe loaded him in the back of our pickup in the second seat, and we start heading to town to the emergency room right away,\u201d Brad Kott recalled. \u201cAnd on my way, my wife said, \u2018I think he\u2019s had a stroke.\u2019\u201d\n\nAfter the family arrived at Hill Country Memorial, the local hospital in Fredericksburg, the Kotts say Quinn\u2019s medical care went terribly wrong. Quinn waited in a wheelchair in the emergency room for hours despite his drooping face and slurred speech, and his parents and former hospital administrators say, the ER doctor was inattentive, callous and at a point late in the evening, decided to send Quinn home.\n\nAs Brad Kott brought his son out to his truck in the parking lot, his wife refused to take their son home. She rushed back into the ER and demanded to see the doctor.\n\n\u201cI met the doctor coming down the hall, and I said, \u2018Something is wrong with Quinn.\u2019 And he shushed me,\u201d Sherul Kott recalled. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018No, don\u2019t you tell me to shush. You\u2019re the doctor. I\u2019m the mom. There\u2019s something wrong with my son and I need to know what\u2019s wrong with my son, and we are not taking him home.\u2019\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until the next morning that a pediatrician finally examined Quinn. He was rushed to a hospital in San Antonio, about 70 miles south, and died soon after. He had suffered a massive stroke.\n\nFor Dr. Michael Williams, then Hill Country Memorial\u2019s chief executive officer, Quinn Kott\u2019s death in 2009 was a crucible moment.\n\n\u201cWe had a clear opportunity to either do what most hospitals do and what we had done previously, which was get our attorneys involved, be prepared for a lawsuit,\u201d Williams said. \u201cOr we could take a different approach and work directly, reach out to the family and ask them to partner with us in really transforming the hospital.\u201d\n\nIn truth, the hospital\u2019s problems went well beyond the emergency department. \u201cThe hospital was in the red on an annual basis,\u201d said Williams, who is now president of the University of North Texas Health Science Center in Fort Worth. \u201cThe patient satisfaction was very low. The employee satisfaction was very low. And across the board, what we heard from people, was that this used to be the community\u2019s hospital, and now people are leaving the community to go get their care elsewhere.\u201d\n\nYet fixing the problems would not be easy because the troubled hospital Fredericksburg was caught up in larger forces.\n\nSince 2010, more than 50 rural hospitals have closed across the country and hundreds more are in fragile financial condition. Rural populations have declined, and in many places, those that remain are largely elderly or uninsured. At the same time, congressional budget agreements and the Affordable Care Act reduced Medicare reimbursement and subsidies for the uninsured. Many rural hospitals have been unable to withstand the revenue losses.\n\nThe hospital in Fredericksburg, a town of about 10,000 deep in the heart of Texas Hill Country, could easily have faced a similar fate.\n\nDespite the area\u2019s live music scene and strong tourist economy, the hospital was the town\u2019s largest employer and cherished for much of its history. When it opened in 1971, 93 percent of the county\u2019s households contributed money \u2014 including Quinn Kott\u2019s grandparents \u2014 and old photographs show thousands of people lined up to have a first look.\n\nYears later, as the hospital faced the crisis of Quinn Kott\u2019s death, Williams was determined to bring back that spirit. He studied the Toyota plant in San Antonio and hired former Toyota employee Jeff Darnaby to help bring the car company\u2019s revered assembly line principles to Hill Country Memorial.\n\n\u201cThe Toyota production system basically allows you to identify waste, and remove that waste from your processes,\u201d Darnaby said. \u201cAnything that doesn\u2019t add value to the customer, to the process, is considered waste.\u201d\n\nToday at Hill Country Memorial, each department candidly displays specific goals for everyone to see: reduce ER wait times, eliminate falls and improve customer satisfaction. In addition to Toyota, Williams turned to a former executive with Southwest Airlines to remake the hospital\u2019s values and culture, and he hired a former trainer from Ritz Carlton, known for its legendary customer service, to change how patients and families were treated.\n\n\u201cWe took the approach that if we took patients and we treated them better than they\u2019d ever been treated before, that at the end of the day, they would drive the bottom line,\u201d said Williams.\n\nSeven years after Quinn\u2019s death, Hill Country Memorial now ranks among the top 100 hospitals in the country and recently won the nation\u2019s highest presidential honor for excellence through innovation and leadership.\n\nThe sweeping changes can be seen everywhere: staff members, including physicians, greet visitors in the hallway and ask if they need directions; during a daily afternoon quiet time, the hallway lights darken so patients can rest; and the kitchen staff, in an attempt to reduce waste, cut their egg budget in half. Along with other cost saving measures, the hospital cut costs by $600,000.\n\nEmily Padula, the hospital\u2019s chief strategy officer, says whatever the goal \u2013 reducing costs, growing market share, perfecting customer service \u2014 rural hospitals should not think they need a lot of money to improve. \u201cWe found that our costs are about the average for the country for a hospital, employee staffing is about average for the country, and yet our patient satisfaction is in the top 5 to 10 percent of the nation. So it\u2019s not that you have to put in place all these fancy things to make a difference,\u201d Padula said.\n\nIn response to trends affecting hospitals across the country\u2014fewer in-patient visits, declining Medicare reimbursement, and Texas officials\u2019 refusal to expand Medicaid\u2013Hill Country Memorial employees stake out new lines of business in weekly meetings in the so-called \u201cWar Room.\u201d Those efforts have led the hospital to diversify its offerings to include a breast health center with high-tech imaging, home hospice care and a wellness center.\n\nTo capitalize on the abundance of Medicare-insured retirees in Texas Hill Country, the hospital developed a well-regarded hip and knee replacement program that has attracted patients like George Brannies, a fifth generation Texan from the nearby town of Mason. After a riding accident a few years ago, Brannies, 72, sought care from a renowned surgeon in San Antonio. When the hip surgery failed, the rancher and bank chairman decided to try Hill Country Memorial. His surgeon and nurses were so exceptional, Brannies said, that he was back on his horse in four weeks.\n\n\u201cThey take such good care of you. It\u2019s like doing business at in a small-town bank. They give you their cell numbers. They say now if you have a problem, you call us. Try this with one of those big-city hospitals. It doesn\u2019t happen,\u201d he said.\n\nBrannie\u2019s surgeon, Dr. Chuck Romanick, has helped steer Hill Country Memorial\u2019s hip and knee replacement program to more than 400 surgeries a year.\n\n\u201cIn this community, if you do a bad job, everybody knows about it,\u201d Romanick said. \u201cYou will see your bad jobs down at the grocery store or whatever, so you have to focus on quality. And that\u2019s, I think, what we\u2019ve done.\u201d\n\nNow the hospital markets its nationally recognized program well beyond the Texas Hill Country.\n\nJayne Pope became chief executive officer of Hill Country Memorial in 2013, and she attributes much of the hospital\u2019s success to its fervent and never ending focus on improving patient care.\n\n\u201cWe know as a rural center, we can\u2019t do everything,\u201d Pope said. \u201cBut what we do, we determine what those core competencies are, and invest in those skills so that our patients have the best of care.\u201d\n\nBut not every rural hospital can replicate Hill Country Memorial\u2019s success.\n\nLen Nichols, a health economist at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va., says many small towns simply can\u2019t sustain an acute care hospital.\n\n\u201cWe probably have roughly 20 to 30 percent more hospitals beds than we actually need and so who\u2019s going to lose in the long run?\u201d said Nichols. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be those hospitals that are the least efficient, those who cannot deliver good, quality services for the lowest possible cost.\u201d\n\nInstead, the dozens of rural hospitals that have closed\u2013and hundreds more at risk\u2013should consider converting to urgent care centers and partnering with larger regional hospitals, Nichols said, to allow rural residents to be stabilized and moved quickly to hospitals where doctors often have more expertise.\n\nThe changes at Hill Country Memorial came too late for the Kott family. They\u2019re still haunted by the treatment Quinn received and the hospital\u2019s advertising campaign that trumpets its care as \u201cremarkable.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt first it makes me sick to my stomach, because the hospital was not remarkable at all. It just, it tears at you when you see a billboard that says that,\u201d Brad Kott said. \u201cHowever, I know that it has transformed into that, and it makes me proud that people in my community took a bad situation, took our tragedy and worked to turn it around.\u201d\n\nRead the full transcript below:\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Last week, we brought you a story about the many rural communities in the country affected by a recent wave of hospital closures.\n\nTonight, special correspondent Sarah Varney takes us to Fredericksburg, Texas, population 10,000, where a hospital is bucking that trend. Its turnaround is seen as a model for other rural hospitals struggling to keep their doors open.\n\nThis story was produced in collaboration with our partner Kaiser Health News.\n\nBRAD KOTT, Father of Quinn Kott: This is the picture we really love.\n\nSARAH VARNEY: Brad and Sheryl Kott didn\u2019t think much of it seven years ago, when their 13-year-old son, Quinn, a friendly, energetic athlete complained he wasn\u2019t feeling well.

They waited in the E.R. for hours. And the Kotts say the nurses and E.R. doctor were unattentive and callous, at one point deciding to send Quinn home. His mother refused.\n\nSHERYL KOTT, Mother of Quinn Kott: I met the doctor coming down the hall, and I said, something is wrong with Quinn. And he shushed me, because he didn\u2019t want anybody else to hear me. And I said, no, don\u2019t you tell me to shush. You\u2019re the doctor. I\u2019m the mom. There\u2019s something wrong with my son, and I need to know what\u2019s wrong with my son, and we are not taking him home.\n\nSARAH VARNEY: It wasn\u2019t until the next morning that a pediatrician finally examined Quinn.

MICHAEL WILLIAMS, Former CEO, Hill Country Memorial: We had a clear opportunity to do either do what most hospitals do, and what we had done previously, which was get our attorneys involved, be prepared for a lawsuit, take on a defensive mode, try to really guard ourselves, or we could take a different approach and work directly, reach out to the family and ask them to partner with us in really transforming the hospital.\n\nSARAH VARNEY: In truth, says Dr. Williams, who is now president of the University of North Texas Health Science Center in Fort Worth, the hospital\u2019s problems went well beyond the E.R.\n\nDR.

He studied the Toyota plant in San Antonio, and hired former Toyota employee Jeff Darnaby to help bring the car company\u2019s revered assembly line principles to Hill Country Memorial.\n\nJEFF DARNABY, Hill Country Memorial: The Toyota production system basically allows you to identify waste, and remove that waste from your processes. Anything that doesn\u2019t add value to the customer, to the process is considered waste.\n\nSARAH VARNEY: Today, at Hill Country Memorial, each department candidly displays specific goals for everyone to see, reduce E.R. wait times, eliminate falls, and improve customer satisfaction.\n\nJEFF DARNABY: This is based off the top five board that we brought here from Toyota. We didn\u2019t meet this goal yesterday. Here\u2019s where we\u2019re working on today, so I know I need to get in this role.\n\nSARAH VARNEY: And this isn\u2019t something that\u2019s just measured once a year or every quarter. These are sort of real-time feedback.\n\nJEFF DARNABY: Yes, it could be down to daily \u2014 daily tracking and reporting.\n\nSARAH VARNEY: In addition to Toyota, Dr. Williams turned to a former executive with Southwest Airlines to remake the hospital\u2019s values and culture, and he hired a former trainer from Ritz-Carlton, known for its legendary customer service, to change how patients and families were treated.\n\nDR.

I have my cholesterol, high cholesterol.\n\nSARAH VARNEY: To helping local workers like Domingo Gallegos get healthier with free nutrition counseling and access to the hospital\u2019s wellness center, and to more far-reaching initiatives planned out in the hospital\u2019s so-called war room, where new ventures are hatched to improve care and grow the business.\n\nWOMAN: A lot of patients come to class thinking they\u2019re going to cut out this much of my leg.\n\nSARAH VARNEY: To capitalize on the abundance of Medicare- insured retirees in Texas Hill Country, the hospital developed a well-regarded hip and knee replacement.\n\nWOMAN: Total knee replacement means they\u2019re resurfacing both sides of the knee.\n\nSARAH VARNEY: That program that has attracted patients like George Brannies. At 72, Brannies is a fifth-generation Texan from nearby Mason. He\u2019s a rancher and chairman of the local bank.\n\nAfter a riding accident a few years ago, Brannies sought care from a renowned surgeon in San Antonio. When the hip surgery failed, he decided to try Hill Country Memorial. Brannies says his surgeon and nurses were so exceptional that he was back on his horse in four weeks.\n\nGEORGE BRANNIES, Patient, Hill County Memorial: They take such good care of you. It\u2019s like doing business at in a small-town bank. They give you their cell numbers. They say, now, if you have a problem, you call us. Try this with one of those big city hospitals. Yes, it doesn\u2019t happen..\n\nSARAH VARNEY: The hospital now performs some 400 hip and knee surgeries a year, and markets its nationally recognized program well beyond Texas Hill Country.\n\nJayne Pope became CEO of Hill Country Memorial in 2013. She attributes much of the hospital\u2019s success to its fervent and never-ending focus on improving patient care, efforts, Pope says, that don\u2019t need to cost a lot of money.\n\nJAYNE POPE, CEO, Hill Country Memorial: We know, as a rural center, we can\u2019t do everything.
