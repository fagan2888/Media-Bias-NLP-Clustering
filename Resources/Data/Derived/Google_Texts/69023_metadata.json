Ted Cruz, who conducted a more than 21-hour speech marathon in the Senate this week against Obamacare. But he also said that \u201cI have not seen\u201d anything like the gridlock that now has left the country facing a federal shutdown by Tuesday.\n\nMcCain called the federal government \u201cvery dysfunctional.\u201d He was asked about divisions within the GOP over what strategy should be used to kill Obama\u2019s signature health care program.\n\nCopyright 2013 The Associated Press.
