For example, the market tends to dip on Mondays, because some companies have a tendency to release negative news such as disappointing earnings results on Friday after the market has closed.\n\n\u201cIt is thought that if bad news is released when the market is closed and investors have time to digest the information over the weekend that they will respond rationally and not emotionally,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThis leads to lower stock prices when the market is open for trading on Monday.\u201d\n\nSince institutional buyers and sellers control the market, the short sellers seek to close their positions before the weekend. Buying back stock or the closing of the short positions tends to drive up prices on Fridays, Johnson said. When they short sell the stock to re-establish the position on the following Monday, this leads to lower Monday stock prices, he said.\n\nThe Monday \u201cselling pressure could be from traders setting up for the week, since it can be difficult to sit on a short position over a weekend,\u201d said Patrick Morris, CEO of HAGIN Investment Management in New York City.", "article_metadata": {"layout": "main", "description": "While Mondays have proven historically to be the worst day for stock prices and Wednesdays have produced the largest returns, investors should avoid timing the market.", "author": "Ellen Chang", "og": {"site_name": "MainStreet", "description": "While Mondays have proven historically to be the worst day for stock prices and Wednesdays have produced the largest returns, investors should avoid timing the market.", "title": "Why Investors Should Not Time the Market When It Dips On Mondays and Rises on Wednesdays", "url": "https://www.mainstreet.com/article/why-investors-should-not-time-the-market-when-it-dips-on-mondays-and-rises-on-wednesdays", "image": {"width": 600, "secure_url": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/marketboard.jpg", "identifier": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/marketboard.jpg", "height": 400}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "section": "Financial Planning", "keywords": "Monday, Wednesday, timing, stock market, returns, dips, gains, patterns", "fb": {"app_id": 925400040808836}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MainStreet", "section": "Financial Planning", "tag": "patterns", "published_time": "2015-02-17T10:04Z", "author": "https://www.mainstreet.com/author/1611359"}, "date": "2015-02-17T10:04Z", "contentType": "article", "guid": 13023532, "twitter": {"description": "While Mondays have proven historically to be the worst day for stock prices and Wednesdays have produced the largest returns, investors should avoid timing the market.", "title": "Why Investors Should Not Time the Market When It Dips On Mondays and Rises on Wednesdays", "url": "https://www.mainstreet.com/article/why-investors-should-not-time-the-market-when-it-dips-on-mondays-and-rises-on-wednesdays", "image": {"src": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/marketboard.jpg", "identifier": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/marketboard.jpg"}, "site": "@mainstr", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Monday, Wednesday, timing, stock market, returns, dips, gains, patterns"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb61a\"", "article_summary": "ADVERTISEMENTNEW YORK (MainStreet) \u2014 While Mondays have proven historically to be the worst day for stock prices and Wednesdays have produced the largest returns, investors should avoid timing the market.\nFor example, the market tends to dip on Mondays, because some companies have a tendency to release negative news such as disappointing earnings results on Friday after the market has closed.\nWhen they short sell the stock to re-establish the position on the following Monday, this leads to lower Monday stock prices, he said.\n\u201cThis leads to lower stock prices when the market is open for trading on Monday.\u201dSince institutional buyers and sellers control the market, the short sellers seek to close their positions before the weekend.\nBuying back stock or the closing of the short positions tends to drive up prices on Fridays, Johnson said."}
