Chellie Pingree say they\u2019re more in touch with average voters than the three-term congresswoman.\n\nPingree, who enjoys a huge polling and financial advantage in the state\u2019s left-leaning southern district, says that argument is tired and her record proves otherwise.\n\nBoth Gorham Republican Isaac Misiuk, 25, and Sanford independent Richard Murphy, 37, are vying for the North Haven Democrat\u2019s U.S. House seat this year.\n\nBoth face uphill climbs against an incumbent ranked among the 50 wealthiest representatives in Congress by the Capitol Hill newspaper Roll Call. But both challengers also contend they can use Pingree\u2019s massive financial upper hand to their own advantage, painting her as too rich to understand the problems of low and middle class Mainers.\n\n\u201cMaine has [1.3] million residents and only 26,000 are millionaires,\u201d said Murphy, a National Guardsman and longtime construction worker and engineer. \u201cShe is representative of that small group, but that leaves a lot of us out in the cold. \u2026 I\u2019m hoping [voters] look at me and say, \u2018This guy understands what it\u2019s like not knowing if he can fill his gas tank this week.\u2019\u201d\n\nMisiuk, a non-traditional sophomore at the University of Southern Maine, is taking a similar approach to his campaign, albeit with the slant of casting himself as the voice for younger voters.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve struggled with the question of whether to buy formula and food or pay rent,\u201d said Misiuk, who is engaged and has a young son. \u201cI\u2019ve never had to consider the question of which champagne to have on my private jet.\u201d\n\nMisiuk has interned in the office of Republican Gov. Paul LePage, held a leadership position in the Cumberland County Young Republicans and worked as a field organizer for the College Republican National Committee.\n\nMisiuk and Murphy has each said his experience of trying to settle into stable employment should resonate with Maine voters, many of whom are still struggling to recover from the recent recession.\n\nMisiuk worked in retail, managing a RadioShack before moving on to a job in real estate. Murphy, a Massachusetts native, moved to Maine five years ago in hopes of finding work, but was forced to take contract jobs in Korea, Indonesia and Malaysia after coming up empty on the Pine Tree State job market.\n\n\u201cEveryone\u2019s still struggling. I\u2019m still struggling and the powers that be don\u2019t seem to be doing what they need to in order to make things better,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cI\u2019m working two jobs. My wife is working two jobs. We\u2019re doing what we have to do to make ends meet.\u201d\n\nPingree, 59, said she understands the struggles Mainers are going through, that she meets with, takes calls from and reads letters from constituents regularly.\n\nIn 2011, she married Donald Sussman, a billionaire investor and owner of the Maine Today Media newspaper group who donates heavily to Democratic candidates and causes, but said that relatively new wealth doesn\u2019t change the values she previously applied to her years of political service, going back to her eight years in the Maine Senate.\n\n\u201cThis is the fourth time I\u2019ve run, and every election cycle, whether it was the man I was dating or the man I married, the GOP tries to criticize me through him,\u201d Pingree said. \u201cMy voting record hasn\u2019t changed since long before I met Donald. I\u2019ve been married for three years, but I spent decades trying to start small businesses or being a single mom, and those are the experiences I bring with me into Congress.\u201d\n\nA University of New Hampshire Survey Center poll commissioned by the Portland Press Herald late last month found that Pingree\u2019s already sizeable lead in the race may have grown over the last three months.\n\nThe same organizations released poll numbers in June showing Pingree holding a lead of 56 percent to 21 percent over Misiuk. By the next poll in late September, support for Pingree had grown to 66 percent, with Misiuk\u2019s backers dropping to 13 percent.\n\nMurphy did not move the needle on either of the polls, a fact the independent dismissed in part as a result of his lack of name recognition early on, a deficiency he hopes to overcome through a month of grassroots, street-level campaigning.\n\nMurphy, who leans Libertarian in many of his political views, blasted Pingree\u2019s support of Democratic President Barack Obama\u2019s signature Affordable Care Act, as well as her stance favoring stricter record-keeping standards for gun shows and bans on large-capacity ammunition feeders.\n\nMisiuk said he opposed Obamacare\u2019s mandate that nearly all Americans sign up for health insurance, but admitted he\u2019s taking advantage of the part of the law allowing young adults to stay on their parents\u2019 insurance until the age of 26.\n\nThe GOP candidate wants to see Congress pass a law prohibiting expenditures from the Social Security account \u2014 saving that money exclusively for those who paid into it \u2014 as well as cuts to military spending and the abolishment of the federal Department of Education. The work performed by the latter department, he said, should be left in the hands of state-level school administrators.\n\nPingree said she wasn\u2019t thrilled with final version of the Affordable Care Act either, but, unlike her opponents, said the health care law didn\u2019t go far enough. She said she would have supported something closer to universal, government-run health care similar to what\u2019s offered in Canada and other developed nations.\n\nThe incumbent said her support for the law, which aims to make health insurance more accessible to lower income people, as well as her support for a higher minimum wage, are examples of ways she remains the better candidate for struggling Mainers, even if she\u2019s no longer in the same tax bracket.\n\nPingree sits on the powerful House Appropriations Committee, which she said puts her in a prime spot to push government funding for state transportation projects like the Sarah Mildred Long Bridge replacement and programs benefiting Maine employers like Bath Iron Works and Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery.\n\nAll three candidates said they\u2019re skeptical about increased U.S. military involvement in war-torn countries like Iraq and Syria, where Obama has authorized airstrikes in response to belligerent activities by the terrorist Islamic State.\n\nDuring the most recently reported federal filing period, which ended June 30, Pingree raised just over $303,000, with nearly $314,000 cash on hand. Misiuk raised just over $15,000 by the June 30 filing deadline, but ended the period with just under $1,300 cash on hand.
