In a dream, the elder was told to construct a jingle dress and have his granddaughter dance in it\u2014and she was healed.\n\nThe colorful dress is covered with rolled-up snuff can lids attached with bright colored ribbons. The jingles are close enough together to hit one another, creating a near-musical, happy\n\nsound, much like rain. Dancers perform simple zigzag steps\u2014no high stepping or fancy footwork\u2014and make the jingles sway. The jingles are attached to soft cloth such as taffeta\n\nor cotton. The dancer is judged by her footwork and grace.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Pow Wow Dance Style Origins: Jingle Dress Dance, Part 3", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/09/26/basics-jingle-dress-dance-style-157077", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/jingle_dress_dancer_selena_jackson_.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Pow Wow Dance Style Origins: Jingle Dress Dance, Part 3"}, "abstract": "Pow Wow Dance Style Origins: Jingle Dress Dance, Part 3", "dc": {"title": "Pow Wow Dance Style Origins: Jingle Dress Dance, Part 3"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/09/26/basics-jingle-dress-dance-style-157077", "dcterms.creator": "rcjohnson", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "robots": "follow, index", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.date": "2014-09-26T14:23-04:00", "dcterms.title": "Pow Wow Dance Style Origins: Jingle Dress Dance, Part 3"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf6a9\"", "article_summary": "Known also as the Healing Dance, the Jingle Dance originated with the Ojibwe in the Great Lakes region.\nIn a dream, the elder was told to construct a jingle dress and have his granddaughter dance in it\u2014and she was healed.\nThe dress is said to have originated as a means of healing a medicineman\u2019s granddaughter.\nThe colorful dress is covered with rolled-up snuff can lids attached with bright colored ribbons.\nThe jingles are attached to soft cloth such as taffetaor cotton."}
