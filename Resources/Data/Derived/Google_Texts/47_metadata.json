Reid Ribble: \u201cDozens and dozens\u201d of Republicans have told me they won\u2019t vote for Trump if he\u2019s the nominee\n\nposted at 6:41 pm on December 14, 2015 by Allahpundit\n\nLot of this going around lately. Lindsey Graham told a New Hampshire TV affiliate last week that he\u2019s liable to \u201coversleep\u201d on election day 2016 if Republicans nominate Trump. Now here\u2019s Reid Ribble (Update: Right Wisconsin had it first) insisting that not only won\u2019t he vote for Trump, other Republicans on Capitol Hill have told him they won\u2019t either. Quietly, I should say \u2014 they told him that quietly. Saying it loudly where others might hear is apt to have bad consequences for the party. Right, Jeff Flake?\n\nTwo things here. One: I could easily find you \u201cdozens and dozens\u201d of Republicans on Twitter who won\u2019t vote for Marco Rubio if he\u2019s the nominee because he sold them out by backing a terrible immigration bill. There are probably fewer Republicans who would balk at Rubio than would balk at Trump \u2014 Rubio\u2019s a conservative with a few liberal exceptions whereas Trump\u2019s a liberal with a few conservative exceptions \u2014 but let\u2019s not pretend like the donor class\u2019s dreamboat is acceptable to everyone either. Two: Most of these people are lying, whether they know it or not. Primaries are always full of \u201cI won\u2019t vote for X if he\u2019s nominated\u201d blather because each guy\u2019s voters are invested in him and as divisions sharpen up, that investment can turn bitter. Plenty of Romney-haters swore they\u2019d never vote for a man who paved the way for ObamaCare by passing RomneyCare in Massachusetts only to grudgingly pull the lever for him anyway in 2012 because, as usual, even a bad Republican is better than a Democrat. Most Rubio-haters would end up the same way after six months of Hillary propaganda demagoging them as racist and sexist for their political beliefs. (How many Rubio-haters voted for McCain in 2008 despite his much longer record pushing amnesty?)\n\nThe conservative anti-Trump contingent might be different, though, because Trump himself is so different. Weighing Rubio versus Hillary means deciding between a guy who\u2019d govern conservatively and agree to an amnesty with some new enforcement measures against a woman who\u2019d govern liberally and agree to a mega-amnesty whether there\u2019s security attached or not. Even if you hate Rubio, that\u2019s an easy call. Weighing Trump against Hillary is harder because there\u2019s reason to think he\u2019d govern from the center-left economically and, to the extent that he veered right, that it might be mostly on occasional showy panders like a Muslim travel ban that wouldn\u2019t actually do anything to stop terrorism (and might not even last long depending upon how much heat he took for it). Unlike Cruz or Rubio, Trump as president could redefine what it means to be a Republican, to the exclusion of conservatism, for a generation. If you vote for him over Hillary, you\u2019re accepting that risk in return for no real assurances of what you\u2019re getting policy-wise or even whether it\u2019ll be substantially more right-wing than what Hillary\u2019s offering. This is why I\u2019m skeptical of the \u201clifelong Republicans\u201d who are telling Joe Scarborough that they won\u2019t vote for Trump or Ted Cruz. Those two are night and day. You can think Cruz is charmless and that his populist mien is phony while also believing he\u2019s a good conservative. He\u2019s a known quantity politically, like him or not. He\u2019s unquestionably worth supporting as nominee over Hillary.\n\nBut so will Trump be to most GOPers if he\u2019s the nominee. I think the absolute floor for a major party candidate in a general election in our polarized age is around 45 percent. Trump could spend the summer and fall on the trail next year farting into his microphone for fun and he\u2019d probably do no worse than lose to Hillary by 10 points, around the same margin that McCain did in 2008. You can actually get a glimpse of this in his polling among Latinos: As bad as his favorable ratings among that group tend to be in most polls, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen one yet showing him doing worse head to head against Hillary among Latinos than Romney did against Obama in 2012. Romney appears to have reached the absolute floor with that group which Trump, for all the media heavy breathing about \u201cMexican rapists\u201d and mass deportation, can\u2019t break through. In fact, here\u2019s what Monmouth found today when it asked Republicans how they\u2019ll feel if Trump is nominee:\n\nThe \u201cdissatisfieds\u201d will all come around and even many of the \u201cupsets\u201d will ultimately be swayed by a year\u2019s worth of partisan politics. Besides, one virtue of Trump\u2019s centrism and yuuuuge charisma gap with Hillary is that he\u2019ll pick off a few Democrats too to offset the lost Republicans. He\u2019ll still lose, probably badly, but the age of 20-point blowouts in presidential races is over \u2014 partly because the phenomenon of \u201cI won\u2019t vote for X as nominee\u201d among partisans is largely over too.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Meme du jour.", "title": "GOP Rep.
