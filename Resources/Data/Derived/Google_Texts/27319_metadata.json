Wade, Social News, Life News, News, Politics News\n\nThis originally appeared on ProPublica\n\nRennie Gibbs\u2019s daughter, Samiya, was a month premature when she simultaneously entered the world and left it, never taking a breath. To experts who later examined the medical record, the stillborn infant\u2019s most likely cause of death was also the most obvious: the umbilical cord wrapped around her neck.\n\nBut within days of Samiya\u2019s delivery in November 2006, Steven Hayne, Mississippi\u2019s de facto medical examiner at the time, came to a different conclusion. Autopsy tests had turned up traces of a cocaine byproduct in Samiya\u2019s blood, and Hayne declared her death a homicide, caused by \u201ccocaine toxicity.\u201d\n\nIn early 2007, a Lowndes County grand jury indicted Gibbs, a 16-year-old black teen, for \u201cdepraved heart murder\u201d \u2014 defined under Mississippi law as an act \u201ceminently dangerous to others\u2026regardless of human life.\u201d By smoking crack during her pregnancy, the indictment said, Gibbs had \u201cunlawfully, willfully, and feloniously\u201d caused the death of her baby. The maximum sentence: life in prison.\n\nSeven years and much legal wrangling later, Gibbs could finally go on trial this spring \u2014 part of a wave of \u201cfetal harm\u201d cases across the country in recent years that pit the rights of the mother against what lawmakers, health care workers, prosecutors, judges, jurors, and others view as the rights of the unborn child.\n\nA judge is said to be likely to decide this week if the case should move forward or be dismissed. Assuming it continues, whether Gibbs becomes the first woman ever convicted by a Mississippi jury for the loss of her pregnancy could turn on a fundamental question that has received surprisingly little scrutiny so far by the courts: Is there scientific proof that cocaine can cause lasting damage to a child exposed in the womb, or are the conclusions reached by Hayne and prosecutors based on faulty analysis and junk science?\n\nThe case intersects a number of divisive and difficult issues \u2014 the criminal justice system\u2019s often disproportionate treatment of poor people of color, especially in drug prosecutions; the backlash to Roe v. Wade and the conservative push to establish \u201cpersonhood\u201d for fetuses as part of a broad-based strategy to weaken abortion laws. A wild card in the case \u2014 Mississippi\u2019s history of using sometimes dubious forensic evidence to win criminal convictions over many years \u2014 could end up playing a central role.\n\nProsecutors argue that the state has a responsibility to protect children from the dangerous actions of their parents. Saying Gibbs should not be tried for murder is like saying that \u201cevery drug addict who robs or steals to obtain money for drugs should not be held accountable for their actions because of their addiction,\u201d the state attorney general\u2019s office wrote in a brief to the Mississippi Supreme Court.\n\nBut some civil libertarians and women\u2019s rights advocates worry that if Gibbs is convicted, the precedent could inspire more prosecutions of Mississippi women and girls for everything from miscarriage to abortion \u2014 and that African Americans, who suffer twice as many stillbirths as whites, would be affected the most.\n\nMississippi has one of has one of the worst records for maternal and infant health in the U.S., as well as some of the highest rates of teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted disease and among the most restrictive policies on abortion. Many of the factors that have been linked to prenatal and infant mortality \u2014 poverty, poor nutrition, lack of access to healthcare, pollution, smoking, stress \u2014 are rampant there.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tremendously, tremendously frightening, this case,\u201d said Oleta Fitzgerald, southern regional director for the Children\u2019s Defense Fund, an advocacy and research organization, in Jackson. \u201cThere\u2019s real fear for young women whose babies are dying early who [lack the resources to] defend themselves and their actions.\u201d\n\nThose who share such worries point to a report last year by the New York\u00ad\u2013basedNational Advocates for Pregnant Women (NAPW) that documented hundreds of cases around the country in which women have been detained, arrested and sometimes convicted \u2014 on charges as serious as murder \u2014 for doing things while pregnant that authorities viewed as dangerous or harmful to their unborn child.\n\nThe definition of fetal harm in such cases has been broad: An Indiana woman whoattempted suicide while pregnant spent a year in jail before murder charges were dropped last year; an Iowa woman was arrested and jailed after falling down the stairs and suffering a miscarriage; a New Jersey woman who refused to sign a preauthorization for a cesarean section didn\u2019t end up needing the operation, yet was charged with child endangerment and lost custody of her baby. But the vast majority of cases have involved women suspected of using illegal drugs. Those women have been disproportionately young, low-income and African American.\n\nLynn Paltrow, the executive director of NAPW, said that decisions to arrest and charge women often have political and moral overtones and are mostly based on unproved or discredited notions about the effects of prenatal drug exposure.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has established stringent rules limiting the use of unproved science in legal proceedings, but these often fall by the wayside in fetal harm cases, Paltrow said. She said that women are typically convicted based on evidence that would be demolished by lawyers with the time and resources to effectively refute it in court \u2013 lawyers, say, for pharmaceutical companies whose drugs are challenged in court as being unsafe.\n\n\u201cIf a pregnant, drug-using woman were a corporation, her case wouldn\u2019t even get to trial because the rules of evidence require that there be science to prove causation,\u201d Paltrow said.\n\nThe quality of the science is very much an issue in the Gibbs case.In a motion to throw out Hayne\u2019s autopsy report, defense lawyers have claimed that that the medical examiner misinterpreted toxicology results and failed to explore alternative causes of death.\n\nThose claims are not the first time Hayne\u2019s work has come under attack. Indeed, Hayne \u2014 who effectively served as Mississippi\u2019s statewide medical examiner from the late 1980s to 2008, eventually performing 80 to 90 percent of the autopsies in the state annually \u2014 has been a hugely influential and controversial figure in the criminal justice system there for years.\n\nIn litigation (much of it by the Mississippi Innocence Project) and news reports (many of them by Radley Balko, now of the Washington Post), defense lawyers and other medical examiners have accused Hayne of being sloppy, exaggerating his credentials, and leaping to conclusions that sometimes had no basis in science. At least four murder convictions based on Hayne\u2019s evidence \u2014 one involving an innocent man sentenced to death for the killing of a three-year-old girl \u2014 have been overturned since 2007.\n\nDespite having failed to complete his certification test by the American Board of Pathology, Hayne not only practiced for two decades in Mississippi and nearby states, but by his own estimate he performed as many as 1,800 autopsies a year (the National Association of Medical Examiners recommends that a single doctor conduct no more than 250). Mississippi stopped hiring Hayne in 2008, but he continues to testify in cases that he handled before then.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new \"fetal harm\u201d case could open door for women to be prosecuted for everything from miscarriage to abortion", "title": "A terrifying precedent: Woman to be tried for murder for giving birth to stillborn", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "A new \"fetal harm\u201d case could open door for women to be prosecuted for everything from miscarriage to abortion", "title": "A terrifying precedent: Woman to be tried for murder for giving birth to stillborn", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/03/22/a_terrifying_precedent_woman_to_be_tried_for_murder_for_giving_birth_to_stillborn/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2010/11/colorado_rejects_fetal.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A new \"fetal harm\u201d case could open door for women to be prosecuted for everything from miscarriage to abortion", "title": "A terrifying precedent: Woman to be tried for murder for giving birth to stillborn", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2010/11/colorado_rejects_fetal.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Nina Martin", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Abortion, fetal harm, Mississippi, Pregnancy, ProPublica, Roe v.
