Depending on which is greater, uninsured could pay up to $2,085 bucks or 2.5% of their annual household income. Payment is due on 2016 taxes.\n\nThis year\u2019s penalty for missing the deadline is bigger than last. Depending on which is greater, uninsured could pay up to $2,085 bucks or 2.5% of their annual household income. Payment is due on 2016 taxes.\n\nAccording to insurance expert Stacy McAtee, with UnityPoint St. Luke's in Cedar Rapids, about six percent of Iowa's population is uninsured. Six percent of those people are in Linn County, about 11,280. That's the second highest collection of uninsured in the state, next to Polk County.\n\nHispanic men, 18 to 34 are the largest demographic without insurance at 16%. They're followed by African American men in the same age group at 15%. McAtee called them the \"invincibles\".\n\n\u201cWe're seeing a greater number of uninsured people between the ages of 18-34, who think that they're not going to get sick,\u201d McAtee said. \u201cI always tell them, you can't plan an appendectomy. The best health won't keep you from having appendicitis.\"\n\nMcAtee said insurance is often more affordable than people realize. She said the majority who apply through the online marketplace qualify for tax sharing or premium subsidies.\n\n\u201cEight out of ten people, typically pay $100 or less for their premiums each month,\u201d McAtee said. \u201cThat's once they have the tax credits to help with those premiums.\u201d\n\nTo find coverage, the computer savvy can head to HealthCare.gov to sign up through that online marketplace. If a phone sounds better, try 1-800-318-2596. McAtee said it'll take as few as ten minutes to get coverage.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u201cWe're seeing a greater number of uninsured people between the ages of 18-34, who think that they're not going to get sick,\u201d McAtee said. \u201cI always tell them, you can't plan an appendectomy.'", "language": "english", "author": "Forrest Saunders, KCRG-TV9", "og": {"url": "http://www.kcrg.com/content/news/ACA-Deadline-Looms-Thousands-Still-Uninsured-in-Linn-County-364631391.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/HOSPITAL79.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "\u201cWe're seeing a greater number of uninsured people between the ages of 18-34, who think that they're not going to get sick,\u201d McAtee said. \u201cI always tell them, you can't plan an appendectomy.'", "title": "ACA Deadline Looms, Thousands Still Uninsured in Linn County"}, "twitter": {"description": "\u201cWe're seeing a greater number of uninsured people between the ages of 18-34, who think that they're not going to get sick,\u201d McAtee said. \u201cI always tell them, you can't plan an appendectomy.'", "title": "ACA Deadline Looms, Thousands Still Uninsured in Linn County", "url": "http://www.kcrg.com/content/news/ACA-Deadline-Looms-Thousands-Still-Uninsured-in-Linn-County-364631391.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/HOSPITAL79.jpg", "creator": "@KCRG", "site": "@KCRG", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "ACA Deadline Looms, Thousands Still Uninsured in Linn County", "fb": {"app_id": 1482644542038403, "pages": 57827502171}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "_pi-uBEP3DU48yOrVs_IYPqZzPgLtRkS7bl24Ebx1MY", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "ACA Deadline Looms, Thousands Still Uninsured in Linn"}, "article_summary": "The January 31st deadline to sign up for the Affordable Care Act is fast approaching and thousands of Iowans in Linn County are still uninsured.\nDepending on which is greater, uninsured could pay up to $2,085 bucks or 2.5% of their annual household income.\nAccording to insurance expert Stacy McAtee, with UnityPoint St. Luke's in Cedar Rapids, about six percent of Iowa's population is uninsured.\nThat's the second highest collection of uninsured in the state, next to Polk County.\n\u201cWe're seeing a greater number of uninsured people between the ages of 18-34, who think that they're not going to get sick,\u201d McAtee said."}
