Rand Paul (R-Ky.) let loose on President Obama Tuesday at the University of South Carolina, going into candidate mode in using some of his strongest language yet to condemn the president\u2019s dismissal of constitutional forms and the rule of law.\n\n\u201cThe president says that \u2018if Congress won\u2019t act, I must.\u2019 That sounds like what you hear from a Third World autocrat. That doesn\u2019t sound like someone who believes in a Republic and rule of law,\u201d Paul told a small student audience.\n\n\u201c\u2018If Congress won\u2019t act, I will?\u2019 Congress is too messy for him. Democracy is too messy for him so he\u2019s just going to do whatever the hell he wants.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t hold back, senator.\n\nPaul was referring to Obama\u2019s general reliance on fiat rule at the expense of constitutional checks and balances, but his remarks were intended as a direct criticism of the president\u2019s unilateral action to mount a military response to ISIS.\n\n\u201cI think we should do something [about ISIS], but the president is going about it the wrong way,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThat worries me and it should worry all of us. And it hasn\u2019t been just with war powers. It\u2019s been with immigration, it\u2019s been with healthcare. He\u2019s acted outside the law and we have basically a constitutional confrontation now between an overbearing and arrogant executive who doesn\u2019t believe in the law and a Congress that hasn\u2019t really stepped up to enforce the law.\u201d\n\nBreitbart, which periodically posts exclusive opinion columns penned by the GOP presidential hopeful, had access to Paul following the speech, and learned that the political left is paying enough attention to Paul\u2019s message to send their partisan paparazzi to his speaking engagements \u2014 in the hope of collecting attack fodder:\n\nAt the event, Paul communications director Sergio Gor told Breitbart News three leftwing trackers-political operatives who wield video cameras to record statements to attack their political opponents-were present: one from the Democratic National Committee (DNC), another from pro-Hillary Clinton operative David Brock-run group American Bridge and another from a local leftwing group.\n\nPaul said the extra attention stems, in part, from his cross-party appeal as a candidate who\u2019s willing to distance himself from establishment GOP positions he considers stagnant or harmful. \u201cI think they fear me because I am outside the mold and I will attract Democrats and Independents and that I can create new constituencies that would allow the Republican Party to win again,\u201d he said.\n\nPaul\u2019s comments came as part of a far-ranging speech that touched not only on foreign policy, but also on domestic surveillance, student loans, civil liberties and, of course, the Fed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to keep pushing for a vote on audit the Fed, and this is the second time I think it\u2019s passed the House and it passed with what 350 votes? There\u2019s overwhelming bipartisan support for it,\u201d Paul said, according to Breitbart.", "article_metadata": {"projectnami": {"version": "1.3.3"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Personal Liberty\u00ae", "description": "Sen.
