America has just never treated royalty well.\n\nThe political equivalent of the Nutty Professor, Vermont\u2019s independent, democratic socialist U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, is closing the gap against Hillary Clinton, Inc. among Democrats in Iowa and nationally as the electorate begins to focus on the first caucus. In this sketchy, rough-and-tumble land of the free, divine right is actually considered wrong.\n\nWhat can even \u201cthe smartest woman in the world\u201d do about that?\n\nThis week, perhaps decided on a 3 a.m. phone call, the former First Lady of Arkansas, and then of all these United States, and later U.S. Senator from the Empire State of New York, and most recently the frequent-est flying-est Secretary of State the world of reset buttons and regime change has ever known, determined it was now finally time to unveil the newest Clintonian super-weapon: former (and perhaps soon to be again) First Daughter Chelsea Clinton.\n\nYes, you know her as a savvy media star, who years back garnered a fat $600,000 a year salary from NBC, even without any experience, and for what seemed like part-time work. Her once poverty-stricken parents were undoubtedly proud.\n\nOf course, Chelsea thinks altogether differently about money than do her parents. \u201cI was curious if I could care about [money] on some fundamental level,\u201d the young Clinton told the London Telegraph, \u201cand I couldn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nPoor Chelsea had to leave that sweet NBC gig when her mom\u2019s presidential campaign commenced, hopefully without too much economic suffering. Her net worth has been pegged at merely $15 million \u2014 most coming from her work for Avenue Capital Investment Group and McKinsey & Co. \u2014 but she clearly doesn\u2019t even think about money.\n\nAt heart, Chelsea Clinton is just one of the little people, whatever they\u2019re like.\n\nStill, her new role with her mother\u2019s campaign is certainly new for her: attack dog. You might expect former President Bill Clinton to serve in that position, but Donald Trump appears to have turned him into a puppy dog by bringing up his past philandering, perjury and worse: charges of sexual harassment and rape.\n\nAnd women\u2019s rights uber-advocate Hillary Clinton has forcefully and unequivocally said such accusations \u201chave the right to be believed.\u201d\n\nBack to Chelsea, she launched her first IED at her mother\u2019s chief rival in the presidential primaries last Tuesday. \u201cSen. Sanders wants to dismantle Obamacare, dismantle the [Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program], dismantle Medicare, dismantle private insurance,\u201d she charged, telling an Iowa audience that he \u201cwould strip millions and millions and millions of people off their health insurance.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a charge the liberal Politifact found to be \u201cmostly false.\u201d (Oh, what a chip off the old block!)\n\nThe Sanders campaign quickly fired back that the young Clinton was \u201cwrong\u201d and disingenuously ignoring the fact that Sanders would bestow government-paid healthcare coverage on every American. For free! (Unless you happen to pay taxes, that is. Then, it\u2019d be very expensive.)\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t an honest attack,\u201d declared Democratic strategist David Axelrod on CNN.\n\n\u201cThe thing that tells you as much as anything about [the Clinton campaign\u2019s] current state of mind is Chelsea going on the attack. It tells you everything you need to know,\u201d one Democratic strategist told The Hill anonymously, afraid to speak publicly out of fear for his career and physical well-being. \u201cThat this [challenge from Sanders] is real and they\u2019ve got to be freaking out.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m 100 percent for sharp elbows and blunt contrasts in campaigns, including paid negative ads in every possible medium,\u201d offered the brave Democratic strategist Craig Varoga. \u201cBut I cringe at the idea of using close family members to carry personal attacks, especially when the opponent is well-positioned to say the attack is untrue and desperate.\u201d\n\nLiberal Rep. Ra\u00c3\u00bal Grijalva (D-Ariz.) was \u201csurprised\u201d by the attack from Chelsea and \u201cthought it was out of character. It seems the Clinton campaign is going into full destruction mode very early in this process.\u201d\n\nDestruction hasn\u2019t been the result. \u201cAs of now, we are at about $1.4 million raised since yesterday when the panic attacks by the Clinton campaign began,\u201d reported a Sanders campaign spokesman. \u201cWe\u2019ve gotten 47,000 contributions. We\u2019re projecting 60,000 donations. Even for our people-powered campaign, this is pretty darn impressive.\u201d\n\nBeyond the misleading nature of the former First Daughter\u2019s comments, there are big problems for Hillary Clinton even when she accurately bashes Sen. Sanders over his far too expensive single-payer healthcare schemes: (1) progressive Democrats like single-payer pipe-dreams and vote in Democratic presidential primaries, and (2) she, too, has supported and claims to continue to support government-run, single-payer national healthcare.\n\nAfter the Chelsea attack-dog hub-bub this week, Rachel Maddow asked Hillary Clinton if she disagrees \u201cwith single-payer as a goal?\u201d Clinton responded, \u201cNo. I agree with universal health care,\u201d adding \u201cNo matter how you get there.\u201d\n\nHillary vehemently defended her daughter, of course. Still, even the 2008 version of Hillary took issue with her daughter\u2019s slap at Sanders.\n\nBack then, rival Sen. Barack Obama took issue with a single-payer system Hillary was promoting. Mrs. Clinton railed against his \u201ctactics right out of Karl Rove\u2019s playbook,\u201d and asked, \u201cSince when do Democrats attack one another on universal healthcare?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is wrong and every Democrat should be outraged,\u201d she continued. \u201cSo shame on you, Barack Obama!\u201d\n\nNow it\u2019s Hillary Clinton who knows no shame.\n\nRepublicans have never trusted Hillary Clinton. Polls show independent-minded voters find her less than honest. Now even Democrats are witnessing her campaign throw caution and credibility to the wind.\n\nShouldn\u2019t the first woman president be someone we can believe, someone we can be proud of?\n\nNot a Clinton, in other words.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hillary Clintons second arranged presidential coronation is not going according to plan.
