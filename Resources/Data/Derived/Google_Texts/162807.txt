JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - It was an emotional day as family and friends gathered to say goodbye to their loved ones heading overseas.

The U.S.S. Carney left Naval Station Mayport on Sunday morning and deployed to Spain. It's the last of four U.S. ships to leave Mayport for Spain.

The sailors will be supporting naval operations in the Mediterranean Basin and in the Atlantic Ocean.



People with loved ones on board the U.S.S. Carney moved closer as the ship left for Spain. It was a somber day for many of the families including Maria Pickard. Her husband is Kenneth Pickard and he's is the captain of the ship.



"We're sad to see him go. But we are very proud of him. Very proud of what he does for our family and this country, and we know that he will do great," Maria Pickard said.

Pickard's daughter will be thinking about her father while he's deployed.



"I'm going to miss his sarcastic jokes. I don't really know a lot of stuff, but I know he'll be safe," Martina Pickard said.



Dozens of families gathered to see their family members off.

Some came with signs to show their support. July Rangel says she's moving to Spain for a few years so she can see her husband and so her daughter can see her father.



"Very exciting. Get to see new cultures. Meet new people, new friends. She gets to go to school and learn a new language," Rangel said.



The ship will be permanently based in Spain. The sailors could be in Spain as long as their tour lasts and right now it's not clear how long that will be.
