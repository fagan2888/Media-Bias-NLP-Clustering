This paper explores the potential of hospitals to be such hubs by examining the experience of Washington Adventist Hospital (WAH), a community hospital in Maryland.\n\nWAH is a particularly interesting example for several reasons. For instance, it is in a state with a health care budgeting approach and an enhanced readmissions penalty system that provides strong incentives for community outreach. The Adventist HealthCare system\u2019s mission statement also emphasizes community care. Moreover WAH has aggressively undertaken a range of community initiatives. These include partnerships with an organization to help discharged patients to sign up for social services and benefits, and with local church and faith community nurses programs, a \u201chotspots\u201d approach to tackle safety and other issues in housing projects with a high incidence of 911 calls, and a proposed housing initiative with Montgomery County, Maryland, to address the transition needs of homeless patients.\n\nThe WAH experience highlights several challenges facing hospitals seeking to be community hubs. Among these:\n\nThe full impact of a hospital\u2019s community impact \u2013 especially beyond health impacts \u2013 is rarely measured and rewarded, leading to insufficient incentives for hospitals to realize their full potential.\n\nCreative approaches require regulatory and budget flexibility, especially at the state and county level, which is often lacking.\n\nData sharing is needed for effective partnerships, but interoperability problems and privacy laws hamper this.", "article_metadata": {"description": "With today&rsquo;s emphasis on population health strategies to address &ldquo;upstream&rdquo; factors affecting health care, such as\nhousing and nutrition deficiencies, there is growing interest in the potential role of hospitals to be effective leaders\nin tackling upstream factors that influence health, social and economic wellbeing.&nbsp;", "title": "Hospitals as Hubs to Create Healthy Communities: Lessons from Washington Adventist Hospital", "og": {"site_name": "The Brookings Institution", "description": "With today&rsquo;s emphasis on population health strategies to address &ldquo;upstream&rdquo; factors affecting health care, such as\nhousing and nutrition deficiencies, there is growing interest in the potential role of hospitals to be effective leaders\nin tackling upstream factors that influence health, social and economic wellbeing.&nbsp;", "title": "Hospitals as Hubs to Create Healthy Communities: Lessons from Washington Adventist Hospital", "url": "http://www.brookings.edu/research/papers/2015/09/28-hospitals-as-hubs-to-create-health-communities-butler-grabinsky-masi", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/papers/2015/09/health%20neighborhood/healthcommunity/healthcommunity_16x9.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 360}, "locale": "en", "type": "article", "determiner": "auto"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 151106990, "title": "Hospitals as Hubs to Create Healthy Communities: Lessons from Washington Adventist Hospital", "image": {"width": 560, "identifier": "http://www.brookings.edu//~/media/research/files/papers/2015/09/health%20neighborhood/healthcommunity/healthcommunity_16x9.jpg?w=560", "height": 315}, "site": {"identifier": "BrookingsInst", "id": 151106990}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "With today&rsquo;s emphasis on population health strategies to address &ldquo;upstream&rdquo; factors affecting health care, such as\nhousing and nutrition deficiencies, there is growing interest in the potential role of hospitals to be effective leaders\nin tackling upstream factors that influence health, social and economic wellbeing.&nbsp;"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 137459917707}, "ces": {"broadcontenttype": "Commentary", "title": "Hospitals as Hubs to Create Healthy Communities: Lessons from Washington Adventist Hospital", "topicsspecialized": "Social Mobility ; Human Capital", "topicsbroad": "Economics ; Health ; Metropolitan Areas", "centers": "Center for Health Policy", "experts": "Stuart M.
