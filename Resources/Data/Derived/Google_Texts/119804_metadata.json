He\u2019s the COO of a small business called Applied Machinery; his company makes oil-drilling rigs for the extraction industry; and he\u2019s from the deep red state of Texas. In all, it\u2019s safe to say that whether he\u2019s political or not, he isn\u2019t used to receiving unpleasant news from the GOP.\n\nSo for McDevitt, the recent battle in Washington over the future of the Export-Import Bank of the United States has been a new experience. Conservative Republicans in Congress seem intent on shutting down the Ex-Im Bank, which offers loans and guarantees to U.S. companies and foreign purchasers as a means of encouraging the export of U.S-made goods. (It costs taxpayers nothing; the bank operates at a profit.)\n\nRelated: McCarthy Rolls Over for Tea Party on Ex-Im Bank\n\n\u201cI was shocked to find out it was Republicans in Congress that aren\u2019t supporting the Ex-Im Bank,\u201d McDevitt said.\n\nThe two congressional districts in the Houston area where the several hundred employees of Applied Machinery work are represented by Ted Poe and Kevin Brady, two Republican lawmakers. Poe is an avowed opponent of Ex-Im, having voted against the renewal of its charter in 2012. Brady, who voted in favor of it in 2012, has not yet taken a public stance on renewing the charter when it expires at the end of the summer.\n\nThis puzzles McDevitt. \u201cTexas is the number one exporting state in the country and Houston is the number one exporting city,\u201d he said. \u201cNot to have a congressman stand up for exports, stand up for U.S. jobs? I\u2019m shocked.\u201d\n\nNeither Poe\u2019s nor Brady\u2019s office returned requests for comment on this story.\n\nRelated: New House Leaders Primed for Internal Struggle\n\nThe White House wants the bank reauthorized, as do many Senate Democrats. But hard-right conservatives in Congress argue that the bank is an example of \u201ccrony capitalism\u201d \u2013 the government providing sweetheart loan guarantees and other benefits to big corporations instead of forcing companies to get their financing on the open market.\n\nAnd on its face, they have a case.\n\nAccording to Ex-Im\u2019s own records, more than three quarters of the financial support the bank provides to U.S. businesses goes to a handful of huge corporations, including Boeing, General Electric, and Bechtel.\n\nThere are counter arguments, of course. Boeing\u2019s sole competitor is Airbus, the European airplane manufacturer that receives massive subsidies from multiple European governments. GE, Bechtel, and other U.S. multinationals compete with companies around the world whose governments aggressively subsidize exports.\n\nRelated: Infrastructure Tops To-Do List of Top Economists\n\nAs conservative economist Douglas Holtz-Eakin put it, it is essential that the U.S. not \u201cdisarm\u201d in fights over trade.\n\n\u201cThe reality is you would like to live in a world \u2026 that does not have a need for an export import bank, one where international transactions were done on a level playing field,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThat\u2019s just not the reality. Many other countries, notably China and the BRICs, other OECD countries, all have an export credit agency.\u201d\n\nMcDevitt\u2019s argument is more specific. His company, he says, faces significant challenges that would be difficult or impossible to overcome without its support.\n\n\u201cWe rely on Ex-Im Bank because we can\u2019t borrow money from the bank without Ex-Im backing it,\u201d he said, recounting the time a bank executive laughed at him when he went looking for a loan to do business in oil-rich Nigeria.\n\nRelated: Clock Ticks for States on Highway Funding\n\n\u201cThis sounds like an email scam,\u201d the banker told him. But when McDevitt came back with a loan guarantee from Ex-Im, Applied Machinery was able to secure a $25 million line of credit for working capital, which allowed the company to bid on \u2013 and win \u2013 the contract.\n\nThe benefit is not just in the provision of working capital. In countries like Nigeria, McDevitt said, it can be hard for purchasers of the equipment he makes to get local financing. Ex-Im loans to purchasers allows some deals to happen that otherwise would not.\n\n\u201cWhen we do international business, it would be very hard for us to compete without the Ex-Im Bank,\u201d he said.\n\nRelated: GOP Targets \u2018Double Dippers\u2019 to Pay for Highway Bill\n\nAs things stand right now, there appears to be a very good chance that the reauthorization of the bank will not get through the Republican-led House of Representatives. House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) has been non-committal, and newly elected Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) has come out against renewal.\n\nThe prospect of the bank\u2019s demise has McDevitt concerned. \u201cIt\u2019s really going to affect our business, because we are bidding on big international projects,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m scared about what\u2019s going to happen. Do I not commit to big international projects because the financing might not be there? Will I be laying people off because of this? I don\u2019t think they understand the effect this will have.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The opposition by some members of the Republican Party to the continued existence of the Export-Import Bank of the U.S. has some executives in traditionally Republican industries reeling.", "title": "Small Biz COO \u2018Shocked\u2019 by GOP Position on Ex-Im Bank", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/07/03/Small-Biz-COO-Shocked-GOP-Position-Ex-Im-Bank", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/06232014_Shipping_Containers_Import_Export.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/07/03/Small-Biz-COO-Shocked-GOP-Position-Ex-Im-Bank", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/06232014_Shipping_Containers_Import_Export.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The opposition by some members of the Republican Party to the continued existence of the Export-Import Bank of the U.S. has some executives in traditionally Republican industries reeling.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe22f6\"", "article_summary": "Related: McCarthy Rolls Over for Tea Party on Ex-Im Bank\u201cI was shocked to find out it was Republicans in Congress that aren\u2019t supporting the Ex-Im Bank,\u201d McDevitt said.\n\u201cWhen we do international business, it would be very hard for us to compete without the Ex-Im Bank,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe rely on Ex-Im Bank because we can\u2019t borrow money from the bank without Ex-Im backing it,\u201d he said, recounting the time a bank executive laughed at him when he went looking for a loan to do business in oil-rich Nigeria.\nConservative Republicans in Congress seem intent on shutting down the Ex-Im Bank, which offers loans and guarantees to U.S. companies and foreign purchasers as a means of encouraging the export of U.S-made goods.\nRelated: New House Leaders Primed for Internal StruggleThe White House wants the bank reauthorized, as do many Senate Democrats."}
