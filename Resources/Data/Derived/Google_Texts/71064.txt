JaVale McGee looked like the old JaVale McGee Friday night, in more ways than one.

The Nuggets’ big man scored 14 points on 6-of-6 shooting with eight rebounds and two blocks in nearly 19 minutes against the Pelicans at Pepsi Center.

In the second quarter, with the Nuggets up by 11, McGee scrambled to grab a rebound off Nate Robinson’s missed three and landed in the front row. And, being McGee, he couldn’t return to the game without getting a kiss.
