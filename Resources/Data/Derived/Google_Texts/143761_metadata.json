Until recently, centrist GOPers would greet tea-party saber-rattling about going third party with a Vader-esque \u201cnooooooooooo.\u201d Lately, based on what I see on Twitter, the feeling seems to be more of a \u201chmmmmmmm.\u201d If you believe that RINOs are no different from Democrats then there\u2019s no reason to fear losing to Democrats repeatedly over the short- and medium-term due to a split right-wing vote. And if you believe that the tea party is destroying the Republican Party\u2019s brand, amputating it now might be the only way to preserve the GOP as a rallying point for center-right voters. In theory, without very conservative voters in the party, some centrists who\u2019ve been reluctantly voting Democratic lately due to fear/loathing of the right will decide it\u2019s safe to come home to the newly RINO-esque GOP. Won\u2019t be enough to stop Hillary, but then, that\u2019s not the point. The whole point of the centrist/conservative brawling lately is that each side seems to see the other, not the Democrats, as the most immediate, threatening obstacle to good government in America. Hard to keep a movement together when it\u2019s in a state like that.\n\nSo here\u2019s conservative Sean Hannity saying maybe it\u2019s time for a right-wing third party, and here\u2019s centrist David Frum saying, \u201cYeah, maybe.\u201d\n\nPragmatists want to change the GOP so that it can win elections and govern effectively. Tea party Republicans prefer to express their principles regardless of consequences, which is why the Pew survey in September found that 71% of them favored a government shutdown even though nearly 40% of them expected that shutdown to have a \u201cmajor\u201d impact on the economy\u2026 Yet politics is a complicated business, and it\u2019s not always true that a party is weakened by the departure of its most extreme supporters\u2026 Right now, tea party extremism contaminates the whole Republican brand. It\u2019s a very interesting question whether a tea party bolt from the GOP might not just liberate the party to slide back to the political center \u2014 and liberate Republicans from identification with the Sarah Palins and the Ted Cruzes who have done so much harm to their hopes over the past three election cycles. It\u2019s worth repeating over and over again. Add Todd Akin in Missouri and Richard Mourdock in Indiana, Sharron Angle in Nevada and Ken Buck in Colorado, Christine O\u2019Donnell in Delaware and Joe Miller in Alaska \u2014 and you have half a dozen Senate races lost to the GOP by extremist nominations.\n\nSimple math for both wings: If you think the RINOs/tea partiers are ultimately costing you more votes than they\u2019re winning you, then you should consider accepting near-term losses to Democrats after a schism as the price of being able to rebrand and build a party platform that truly represents your constituency. For RINOs, that would mean mild spending cuts and very mild entitlement reform, if any; for tea partiers, it would mean more aggressive cuts and reforms. On social issues, RINOs would likely back gay marriage and amnesty; tea partiers would oppose both. You might even see foreign-policy delineations emerge, with RINOs sticking to Bush-esque hawkishness and tea partiers tilting a bit more towards the Paul \u201cnon-interventionist\u201d position.\n\nA key question: If it did happen, would that drag Democrats further to the center or further to the left? They\u2019d have a chokehold on national elections with the right divided, which is precisely why some lefties would feel tempted to up their own demands of the Democratic leadership. \u201cDo what we want,\u201d they\u2019d say, \u201cor we\u2019ll bolt like the tea partiers did and then your national advantage will be gone.\u201d This is why, I think, centrists like Frum want to make sure there\u2019s a RINO alternative to the tea party \u2014 if liberals did start muscling Democrats towards the left, a center-right outlet would be a natural safe harbor for centrist Democrats who are disaffected by their party\u2019s leftward turn. On the other hand, if Democrats tacked towards the center to preserve their national chokehold over the right, that would mean (a) a somewhat more right-wing Democratic Party than we have now and (b) a lot of disaffected liberals, who might eye what the tea party did and start thinking about forming a third (or rather fourth) party of their own. In fact, one point overlooked by most people in the big Gallup poll of third-party fee-vah last week is that Democratic voters increasingly like the idea too:\n\nImagine the electorate split in four \u2014 the Liberal Party with 10 percent of the vote, the Democrats with 40 percent, the GOP with 30 percent, and the Tea Party with 20. Imagine trying to blog that madness every two years during the midterm campaign. Two words, my friends: Traffic goldmine.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Can this marriage be saved?", "title": "Hannity: Maybe it\u2019s time for a new conservative party", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2013/10/15/hannity-maybe-its-time-for-a-new-conservative-party/", "image": {"width": 450, "identifier": "http://media.hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/ga2.jpg", "height": 233}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2013-10-16T00:01:14+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-16T00:55:11+00:00"}, "keywords": "conservative, cruz, hannity, independent, Mike Lee, Rand Paul, Tea Party, Third Party,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd6172\"", "article_summary": "Hannity: Maybe it\u2019s time for a new conservative partyposted at 8:01 pm on October 15, 2013 by AllahpunditVia the Daily Caller, maybe it\u2019s time.\nOn social issues, RINOs would likely back gay marriage and amnesty; tea partiers would oppose both.\nYou might even see foreign-policy delineations emerge, with RINOs sticking to Bush-esque hawkishness and tea partiers tilting a bit more towards the Paul \u201cnon-interventionist\u201d position.\nFor RINOs, that would mean mild spending cuts and very mild entitlement reform, if any; for tea partiers, it would mean more aggressive cuts and reforms.\nAnd if you believe that the tea party is destroying the Republican Party\u2019s brand, amputating it now might be the only way to preserve the GOP as a rallying point for center-right voters."}
