Boston-based American Well has filed suit against Dallas-based Teladoc in U.S. District Court in Massachusetts, mHealth News reports, charging that its online telehealth platform is too similar to its own technology.

"Teladoc has infringed American Well's intellectual property," Ido Schoenberg, American Well's co-founder and CEO, said in a June 8 press release. "While a transparent and competitive landscape is an imperative for innovation, Teladoc has unfairly disregarded American Well's ownership rights to advance its business. We developed and patented these innovations and we owe it to our clients, partners and shareholders to protect them."

The lawsuit centers on a patent related to American Well's platform that enables consumers to search for and connect with online telehealth providers.
