Now, Argentina has become a frontrunner in LGBT health care, lifting a 15-year-old ban that prevents gay and bisexual men from donating blood.\n\nTime reported that this lift could have a great impact on countries like the U.S., who still restrict donations from men in same-sex relationships. At a signing ceremony, Argentina's health minister Daniel Goll\u00e1n said that the change \u201cis scientifically and technically accurate,\u201d as well as based on a medical approach that overtakes an old concept of \u201crisk groups.\u201d He added that under this new policy, Argentina will be moving towards a national blood system that is both safe and inclusive.\n\nArgentina joins a minority of countries, including Spain and Italy, that considers each blood donor on an individual basis, rather than on the basis of their sexual orientation. Bans on gay and bisexual men donating blood are still commonplace in any countries, however, including the U.S.\n\nIn 1983, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a lifelong ban on men donating blood and tissue if they had had sex with another man. The ban was inspired by the AIDS epidemic, and it was to be upheld even if the potential donor didn't test positive for HIV. Some countries are taking steps to address this issue. In 2013, 86 members of congress wrote to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to say that the agency was upholding an outdated policy.\n\n\u201cWe have seen vast advances in blood screening technology, blood donation policy changes in other countries allowing MSM to donate, and opposition from our nation\u2019s blood banks who have called the current ban \u2018medically and scientifically unwarranted,\u201d they wrote. \u201cOur current policies turn away healthy, willing donors, even when we face serious blood shortages.\u201d\n\nThe FDA held a vote in 2014 to alter the ban, rather than totally lift it. The new requirements stated that men who have sex with other men could donate blood, but only if they have been abstinent for at least one year. The FDA is moving forward to implement the new policy.\n\nHowever, some still criticize the new policy, saying that it doesn\u2019t take into account the improvements in testing and safety in the U.S., and that it is still discriminatory at heart; all donated blood in the U.S. is tested for HIV.\n\nThe U.S. has only just implemented its new policy, so it may be a while before we see any changes soon.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "blood, donation, argentina, lifts, ban, gay, men, could, impact, other, countries, restrictive", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "In an \"incredible move,\" Argentina joins a minority of countries that allow gay and bisexual men to donate blood.", "title": "Argentina Now Allows Gay And Bisexual Men To Donate Blood", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/blood-donation-argentina-lifts-ban-gay-men-could-impact-other-countries-restrictive-353368", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/09/19/blood-donation.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In an \"incredible move,\" Argentina joins a minority of countries that allow gay and bisexual men to donate blood.", "title": "Argentina Now Allows Gay And Bisexual Men To Donate Blood", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/blood-donation-argentina-lifts-ban-gay-men-could-impact-other-countries-restrictive-353368", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/09/19/blood-donation.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/09/19/blood-donation.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Hill", "published_time": "2015-09-19T16:51:15-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-21T10:43:04-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "In an \"incredible move,\" Argentina joins a minority of countries that allow gay and bisexual men to donate blood."}, "article_summary": "Now, Argentina has become a frontrunner in LGBT health care, lifting a 15-year-old ban that prevents gay and bisexual men from donating blood.\nBans on gay and bisexual men donating blood are still commonplace in any countries, however, including the U.S.\nThe lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) community has seen some major moves toward equality lately, starting with the Supreme Court ruling that lifted bans against same-sex marriage.\nIn 1983, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a lifelong ban on men donating blood and tissue if they had had sex with another man.\nTime reported that this lift could have a great impact on countries like the U.S., who still restrict donations from men in same-sex relationships."}
