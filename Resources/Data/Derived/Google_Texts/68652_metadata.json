(Photo: Richard Drew/AP file photo / AP)Buy Photo Story Highlights Excellus medicare subscribers won\u2019t be able to fill prescriptions next year at two of the area\u2019s larger pharmacy chains.\n\nMedicare subscribers at Rochester\u2019s largest health insurer won\u2019t be able to fill their prescriptions next year at two of the region\u2019s larger pharmacy chains.\n\nExcellus BlueCross BlueShield has informed self-enrolled customers with Medicare Part D coverage \u2014prescription drugs \u2014 that both Walgreens and Rite Aid will not be participating in the plan next year, beginning on Jan. 1.\n\n\u201cThe change applies only to our Medicare Advantage customers starting in 2015,\u201d Excellus spokesperson Jim Redmond said this week. \u201cEvery year, pharmacies have the choice whether to participate with our plan, just like hospitals and doctors. This year, Walgreens and Rite Aid decided not to participate.\u2019\u2019\n\nRedmond said the pharmacy companies, not Excellus, made the call. No one from either company responded to requests for comment.\n\nThe Rochester region has one of the largest populations of Medicare Advantage customers in the nation. Medicare Advantage refers to enhanced Medicare coverage offered by private health insurers. The federal government provides administrative subsidies to these insurers.\n\nExcellus has about 38,000 Medicare Advantage subscribers in the Rochester area and 130,000 statewide. Medicare Advantage plans grew nationally by 1.4 million people to 15.7 million in 2013-14.\n\nIncreases in premiums and changes in services at the local insurer level have been instituted since The Affordable Care Act was adopted. The federal law is cutting $156 billion over 10 years from Medicare Advantage, cuts that affect insurers and, by extension, providers and pharmacies.\n\nRedmond said the loss of Rite Aid and Walgreens should not be too great an inconvenience for users.\n\n\u201cWhile some pharmacies don\u2019t participate, we have tens of thousands of pharmacies in our network so I\u2019m sure our members will be able to find one that\u2019s close and convenient,\u201d Redmond said.\n\nAn effort has begun to attract the Excellus Medicare Advantage customers moving from Rite Aid and Walgreens.\n\nWegmans Food Markets has run ads and sent out neighborhood flyers seeking to round up the exiled customers.\n\n\u201cYou may have been affected by recent changes in your current Medicare Part D plan,\u201d according to a recent Wegmans flyer. \u201cIf you are self-enrolled in Excellus BlueCross BlueShield, you recently received a notice that Walgreens and Rite Aid are no longer part of its Medicare Part D pharmacy network as of Jan. 1, 2015.\n\n\u201cIf you need to switch pharmacies, we hope you\u2019ll consider Wegmans Pharmacy as your new partner in wellness. Wegmans accepts most Medicare Part D plans, and has been part of the Excellus pharmacy network for over 40 years.\u201d\n\nExcellus and Wegmans also joined forces recently in an move that likely will send more pharmacy customers to the supermarket chain. Excellus subscribers can now get free home delivery of 90-day supplies when they have their prescriptions filled at Wegmans.\n\nTTOBIN@DemocratandChronicle.com\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.rocne.ws/1zYLB7P", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Excellus medicare subscribers won\u2019t be able to fill prescriptions next year at two chains.", "og": {"site_name": "Rochester Democrat and Chronicle", "description": "Excellus medicare subscribers won\u2019t be able to fill prescriptions next year at two chains.", "title": "Walgreens, Rite-Aid won\u2019t accept Excellus coverage", "url": "http://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/money/business/2014/11/26/walgreens-rite-aid-accept-excellus-coverage/19552053/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/democratandchronicle.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Excellus medicare subscribers won\u2019t be able to fill prescriptions next year at two chains.", "title": "Walgreens, Rite-Aid won\u2019t accept Excellus coverage", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/87bd217d7a02e4368a350ce7d700c975a37a2609/c=538-0-2944-2406&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Rochester/2014/11/26/B9315281544Z.1_20141126163856_000+GK898JIM3.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@DandC", "site": "@DandC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600028377", "fb": {"app_id": 176958652324613}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Companies/Rite Aid", "gci-asset-type": "data", "gci-categories": "Companies/Rite Aid", "title": "Walgreens, Rite-Aid won\u2019t accept Excellus coverage", "author": "Staff writer", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "money/business", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/27e0cdf8ed35b42bb6a5c1d99ca0ab2372c2ac0e/c=839-0-2643-2406/local/-/media/Rochester/2014/11/26/B9315281544Z.1_20141126163856_000+GK898JIM3.1-0.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/63181d28a31c08a31cac9694bbddaa5545501f82/c=538-0-2944-2406/local/-/media/Rochester/2014/11/26/B9315281544Z.1_20141126163856_000+GK898JIM3.1-0.jpg", "contenttype": "data", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3ef533998832e49160d05ba6f8f50e7c08116ded/c=137-0-3345-2406/local/-/media/Rochester/2014/11/26/B9315281544Z.1_20141126163856_000+GK898JIM3.1-0.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1497493f2b016431d742b7322d90bb2f53968a87/c=0-224-3482-2183&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/Rochester/2014/11/26/B9315281544Z.1_20141126163856_000+GK898JIM3.1-0.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-11-26T16:39:28.263000-05:00", "shorthed": "Pharmacies won\u2019t accept Excellus", "articleid": 19552053, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a08ab27651978874c3f00e36990c21e4f5e49a92/c=0-224-3482-2183/local/-/media/Rochester/2014/11/26/B9315281544Z.1_20141126163856_000+GK898JIM3.1-0.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6019d2073c6b1c6db13f0b4b144d13914b1a98ce/c=1064-0-2417-2406/local/-/media/Rochester/2014/11/26/B9315281544Z.1_20141126163856_000+GK898JIM3.1-0.jpg"}}}, "article_summary": "Buy Photo Excellus medicare subscribers won\u2019t be able to fill prescriptions next year at Walgreens, one of the region\u2019s larger pharmacy store chains.\nAn effort has begun to attract the Excellus Medicare Advantage customers moving from Rite Aid and Walgreens.\n\u201cThe change applies only to our Medicare Advantage customers starting in 2015,\u201d Excellus spokesperson Jim Redmond said this week.\nThis year, Walgreens and Rite Aid decided not to participate.\u2019\u2019Redmond said the pharmacy companies, not Excellus, made the call.\nMedicare Advantage refers to enhanced Medicare coverage offered by private health insurers."}
