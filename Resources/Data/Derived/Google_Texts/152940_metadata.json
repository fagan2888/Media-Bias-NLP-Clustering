Supporters say the practice will ensure students don\u2019t miss critical instructional time ahead of the high-stakes spring ISTEP+ test and will help districts avoid extending the school year to make up missed days.\n\n\u201cWhen we add days at the end of the year, that\u2019s past the time our students have taken the assessments by which we\u2019re measured,\u201d said East Allen Community Schools Superintendent Ken Folks, whose district of about 9,100 students missed 14 days due to weather last year. \u201cTo be able to capture instructional time prior to those assessments is key to us.\u201d\n\nBut the move to replace face-to-face lessons with virtual instruction has sparked concern from members of the State Board of Education.\n\nBoard member Brad Oliver said he thinks the virtual option is worth exploring but wants assurances from the Department of Education about how attendance and instruction will be monitored. He also thinks lawmakers should define what constitutes an instructional day in a virtual learning environment to ensure students still receive the 180 days of instruction required by state law.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m concerned about students getting lost in the cracks,\u201d Oliver said. \u201cI just don\u2019t see a 7-year-old who\u2019s an average student because they\u2019re living in poverty and for whatever reason they don\u2019t have the resources at home. \u2026 I just find it hard to believe they\u2019re going to call up the hotline to ask a teacher for help with their phonics homework.\u201d\n\nA resolution passed by the state board earlier this month asks the Department of Education to provide more information at a meeting in January.\n\nSchools across the country have been increasingly moving toward virtual instruction in place of snow days as more districts put technology in students\u2019 hands. Last winter\u2019s polar vortex caused some Indiana districts to miss up to 15 days, forcing them to shorten spring breaks, extend school days and tack on extra days at the end of the year.\n\nAs some districts faced the prospect of moving graduation to July, the Department of Education granted waivers allowing eligible districts to use the virtual option to make up some of the time. This year, the department is allowing schools to apply for virtual instruction days in advance.\n\nSchools that want to use the virtual option must ensure that teachers are available to answer questions. Districts also must provide accommodations for students who would normally have assistance in the classroom and provide appropriate learning activities for those with disabilities who don\u2019t use online learning platforms.\n\nThat can include adding extra time to complete the work or apps that read content aloud, said Connie Brown, director of special services for East Allen schools.\n\nSchools also need to ensure that even students without home Internet service can access online learning platforms. Many districts are opening computer labs or providing lists of businesses and libraries with free Internet access to ensure students can complete their lessons. Other, more rural districts, where Internet access can be a challenge have opted to stick with traditional makeup days.\n\nMany school districts will continue to have traditional snow days built into their calendars. And schools say students who can\u2019t complete their work online won\u2019t be penalized if they cannot access the Internet.\n\nRalph Walker, superintendent of the 1,400-student Delphi Community School District, said his district will open its elementary school computer labs for two hours and will direct students to local libraries if access is an issue.\n\nWalker said Delphi schools won\u2019t abandon snow days altogether. Instead, the district will use virtual learning days primarily when school officials know in advance that classes are likely to be canceled.\n\n\u201cIf we can\u2019t plan for it, it will be a regular old-fashioned snow day that we\u2019re going to make up,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "One of the best parts of winter could be melting away for many Indiana students as advances in technology make snow days rarer than an igloo in July.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "One of the best parts of winter could be melting away for many Indiana students as advances in technology make snow days rarer than an igloo in July.", "title": "Snow days melting away in many Indiana schools", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/dec/16/snow-days-melting-away-in-many-indiana-schools/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/16/4d945b264cb36831680f6a706700b7dc.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/16/4d945b264cb36831680f6a706700b7dc.jpg", "description": "One of the best parts of winter could be melting away for many Indiana students as advances in technology make snow days rarer than an igloo in July.", "card": "summary", "title": "Snow days melting away in many Indiana schools"}, "Author": "JENI O'MALLEY", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "INDIANAPOLIS (AP) - One of the best parts of winter could be melting away for many Indiana students as advances in technology make snow days rarer than an igloo in July.\nThis year, the department is allowing schools to apply for virtual instruction days in advance.\nWalker said Delphi schools won\u2019t abandon snow days altogether.\nMany school districts will continue to have traditional snow days built into their calendars.\nSchools across the country have been increasingly moving toward virtual instruction in place of snow days as more districts put technology in students\u2019 hands."}
