It transforms how people experience us, relate to us, and, most important, remember us. We are no longer remembered as vibrant and engaged but as feeble, ineffectual, even pathetic.\"\n\nEmanuel, who is 57 and opposes assisted suicide, said he believes trying to \"endlessly extend life\" is \"misguided and potentially destructive\". He said Eileen Crimmins, a researcher at the University of Southern California, pointed out that \"health care hasn't slowed the ageing process so much as it has slowed the dying process\".\n\nHe pointed to dementia and Alzheimer's statistics showing there will be a vast increase of sufferers in years to come because people are living longer. Even if people live into old age without these diseases, their mental functions decrease, being less able to focus, with declines in mental processing speed and long-term memory.\n\nCreativity is also lessened in the majority, he said, and physical deterioration is \"progressive erosion\" of abilities.\n\n\"We accommodate our physical and mental limitations. Our expectations shrink. Aware of our diminishing capacities, we choose ever more restricted activities and projects, to ensure we can fulfil them. Indeed, this constriction happens almost imperceptibly. Over time, and without our conscious choice, we transform our lives. We don't notice that we are aspiring to and doing less and less. And so we remain content, but the canvas is now tiny.\n\n\"The 'American immortal', once a vital figure in his or her profession and community, is happy to cultivate avocational interests, to take up bird watching, bicycle riding, pottery, and the like. And then, as walking becomes harder and the pain of arthritis limits the fingers' mobility, life comes to centre around sitting in the den reading or listening to books on tape and doing crossword puzzles. And then ... \".\n\nPeople, Emanuel said, do not want to be remembered as forgetful, sluggish burdens but as active, funny and engaged individuals. He believes at the age of 75, humans reach this moment when they have lived rich lives and \"hopefully imparted the right memories to our children\".\n\n\"Yes, with effort our children will be able to recall that great family vacation, that funny scene at Thanksgiving, that embarrassing faux pas at a wedding. But the most-recent years\u2014the years with progressing disabilities and the need to make caregiving arrangements\u2014will inevitably become the predominant and salient memories.\"\n\nEmanuel said a rejection of his view is natural, and that he does not think it is wrong to want to live as long as possible, but that for him \"75 defines a clear point in time\".", "article_metadata": {"com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages06.net,amp.ibtimes.co.uk,e-amp.newsweek.com,e-sns.newsweek.com,europe.newsweek.com,ibtimes.co.uk,newsweek.com,sns.europe.newsweek.com,sns.ibtimes.co.uk,www.ibtimes.co.uk", "Description": "Prominent American doctor says he wants to die at 75.", "Author": "Hannah Osborne", "og": {"site_name": "International Business Times UK", "description": "Prominent American doctor says he wants to die at 75.", "title": "ObamaCare Doctor Ezekiel Emanuel: Longevity is Overrated", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/obamacare-doctor-ezekiel-emanuel-longevity-overrated-1466959", "image": "https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1400847/ezekiel-emanuel.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Prominent American doctor says he wants to die at 75.", "title": "ObamaCare Doctor Ezekiel Emanuel: Longevity is Overrated", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/obamacare-doctor-ezekiel-emanuel-longevity-overrated-1466959", "image": "https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1400847/ezekiel-emanuel.jpg", "site": "@IBTimesUK", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"app_id": 133405490194030}, "Googlebot-news": "index, follow", "Keywords": "Ezekiel Emanuel,Ezekiel J Emanuel,obama care Ezekiel Emanuel,affordable care act Ezekiel Emanuel,Ezekiel Emanuel wants to die at 75,Ezekiel Emanuel longevity,longevity overrated,growing old is overrated,american immortal,obsession with longevity,Obamacare", "article": {"section": "Health", "tag": "obama care Ezekiel Emanuel", "published_time": "2014-09-24T12:09:28+01:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-24T14:37:03+01:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Health,Ezekiel Emanuel,Ezekiel J Emanuel,obama care Ezekiel Emanuel,affordable care act Ezekiel Emanuel,Ezekiel Emanuel wants to die at 75,Ezekiel Emanuel longevity,longevity overrated,growing old is overrated,american immortal,obsession with longevity,Obamacare"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4235\"", "article_summary": "We are no longer remembered as vibrant and engaged but as feeble, ineffectual, even pathetic.\"\nA prominent US doctor credited as the architect of Barack Obama's healthcare reform for America, ObamaCare, has said longevity is overrated and that he hopes to die at 75.\nPeople, Emanuel said, do not want to be remembered as forgetful, sluggish burdens but as active, funny and engaged individuals.\nEmanuel, who is 57 and opposes assisted suicide, said he believes trying to \"endlessly extend life\" is \"misguided and potentially destructive\".\nHe pointed to dementia and Alzheimer's statistics showing there will be a vast increase of sufferers in years to come because people are living longer."}
