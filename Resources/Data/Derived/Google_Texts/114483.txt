Donald Trump speaks to Pat Robertson at Regent Univ. (screen grab)

Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump charged on Wednesday that Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) was to blame for President Barack Obama’s health care reform law, which the candidate said was “killing everybody.”

During a forum at Regent University, televangelist Pat Robertson asked Trump what criteria he would use to replace Antonin Scalia and other Supreme Court justices.

Trump used the opportunity to point out that “Sen. Cruz is the one that pushed” for President George W. Bush to appoint Chief Justice John Roberts.

“And Justice Roberts was a terrible, terrible situation because he approved Obamacare when everybody said it was going to be terminated,” the billionaire candidate opined. “Then he had a second time at it, which would have also killed it, and he passed it then too.”

“The one that pushed him harder than anybody was Sen. Cruz. So, Sen. Cruz gave us Obamacare in a true sense,” Trump insisted, drawing laughs from the audience at Regent Univ. “It’s true! It’s true!”

“No matter what he does, he’s been a disastrous judge because Obamacare is killing everybody,” he added. “It’s killing everybody.”
