Sixty-seven percent of the 51.6 million hospital-based services in 2012 was provided by hospitalists as opposed to traditionalists (primary care physicians and others whose services primarily take place outside an acute-care facility), according to an analysis of Medicare payment data.\n\n23. Physician assistants make up about 10 percent of the primary care workforce and represent 9 percent of clinicians in community health centers.\n\n24. There are roughly 5,500 ambulatory surgical centers in the United States.\n\nHospital & Health System Compensation\n\n25.

In the U.S., there are 37 relatively \"firm\" planned hospital construction projects that are estimated to cost $50 million or more, each, according to a report by Reed Construction Data.\n\n59. Fifty-eight percent of the upcoming projects valued at $50 million or more each are considered new work, as opposed to hospital additions or alterations.\n\n60. BJC Healthcare, a nonprofit organization based in St. Louis, is planning the largest dollar allocation for hospital construction in the country at $1.5 billion. The money will be dispersed in several St. Louis locations.\n\nAccountable Care Organizations\n\n61. As of May, the number of accountable care organizations in the United States exceeds 600, according to a May 2014 analysis from Leavitt Partners.\n\n62. Approximately 20.5 million people are covered by ACOs, as of June, including the 5.3 million patients enrolled in the Medicare Shared Savings and Pioneer Programs.\n\n63. Medicare ACOs represent roughly 60 percent of all ACOs in the country, according to CMS.\n\n64. In a survey of 1,183 physician practices, 35 percent had already joined an ACO or planned to join one soon, while 60 percent had not joined an ACO and had no plans of joining one, according to a March 2014 study published in Health Services Research.\n\n65. CMS and HHS estimated ACOs will save the Medicare program up to $940 million in the first four years.\n\n66. There are 37 quality measures ACOs must meet to qualify for shared savings.\n\n67. The Houston-based Memorial Hermann ACO had the most shared savings in performance year one of the Medicare Shared Savings Program, saving $28.34 million.\n\n68.

Oregon leads in Medicaid ACOs with a total of 16 Coordinated Care Organizations covering more than 750,000 lives, according to Leavitt Partners.\n\n70. As of April 2014, more than two-thirds of Americans live in areas served by an ACO and more than 40 percent live in areas served by two or more ACOs, according to an Oliver Wyman report.\n\nHealth IT\n\n71. The Council for Affordable Quality Healthcare estimates the healthcare industry can save about $8.1 billion annually, including $6.7 billion in savings for healthcare providers and $1.4 billion for health plans each year, through additional conversions from manual to electronic transactions.\n\n72. In 2012, paper-based claims submissions cost the healthcare system $2.58 each while electronic claims submissions only cost the healthcare system $0.54 each.\n\n73. In 2013, 59 percent of non-federal acute-care hospitals in the U.S. had adopted at least a basic EHR system, according to the ONC, a 34 percent increase over 2012.\n\n74. A majority of physicians \u2014 83 percent \u2014 report they are using EHRs, according to a Medscape survey.\n\n75.

A majority of hospitals \u2014 78 percent \u2014 have evidence of unnecessary antibiotic combinations being administered for two or more days, resulting in potentially avoidable healthcare costs of nearly $13 million, according to research conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Premier.\n\n93. Of 63,418 total prescribed antibiotics, 7,876 (12.4 percent) were prescribed over the phone, according to a study in Pharmacoepidemiology and Drug Safety. Additionally, the rate of telephone-based prescribing increased over the study period from 2.2 prescriptions per 100 patient-years to 4.2 prescriptions per patient years.\n\n94. Prescription drug spending is expected to account for approximately $272.1 billion of health expenditures in 2013 and increase 6.8 percent in 2014, according to a CMS report.\n\n95.
