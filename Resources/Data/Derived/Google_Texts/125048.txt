You're not going crazy if you thought your water tasted salty during the past few days.

According to New Jersey American Water Company, which draws its water from the Raritan River in Bridgewater, the salty taste is caused by runoff from Central Jersey roads on which salt has been spread throughout the long winter.

When the snow melts or when it rains, the salt can run off into nearby streams and rivers.

The water company emphasizes that the water continues to meet all standards and does not pose a health hazard for most people.

However, the higher level of sodium may be a concern to people on sodium-restricted diets. The water company asks those people to contact their doctors with any questions.

New Jersey American Water said it is working with environmental organizations to discover another way of melting snow and ice on roads.
