Aya was supposed to graduate in 2014, but instead is only on track to receive her degree in 2016. That, Aya says, demonstrates \u201chow hard it has been for me to get through this institution,\u201d though it\u2019s worth noting she is an exceptional case, as Columbia has one of the highest four-year graduation rates in the country.\n\nAya attributed some of her academic troubles to the trauma of having to take Columbia\u2019s current Core Curriculum, which requires students to take a series of six classes with a focus on the culture and history of Western, European civilization. Aya says this focus on the West was highly mentally stressful for her.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s traumatizing to sit in Core classes,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are looking at history through the lens of these powerful, white men. I have no power or agency as a black woman, so where do I fit in?\u201d\n\nAs an example, Aya cited her art class, where she complained that Congolese artwork was repeatedly characterized as \u201cprimitive.\u201d She wanted to object to that characterization but, in the Spectator\u2019s words, was \u201ctired of already having worked that day to address so many other instances of racism and discrimination.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2015/11/columbia_student_traumatized_by_reading_books_about_white_people.html", "image": "http://www.americanthinker.com/assets/images/at-painter-og-image.png", "title": "Blog: Columbia student 'traumatized' by reading books about white people"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "One of the panelists at the event was black Columbia student Nissy Aya.\n\u201cIt\u2019s traumatizing to sit in Core classes,\u201d she said.\nAya was supposed to graduate in 2014, but instead is only on track to receive her degree in 2016.\n\u201cWe are looking at history through the lens of these powerful, white men.\nAya says this focus on the West was highly mentally stressful for her."}
