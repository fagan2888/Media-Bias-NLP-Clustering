What viewers may not have known about \u201cRise of the Drones\u201d was that it was funded in part by Lockheed Martin\u2013the giant aerospace corporation that just happens to be a major drone manufacturer.\n\n\u2013Perfect Weapons Award: Brooke Baldwin, Tom Foreman\n\nWhen it appeared that the US would carry out a military attack on Syria, some CNN reporters stepped right into Pentagon PR mode. Anchor Brooke Baldwin (8/30/13) declared that US warships \u201ccan carry cruise missiles able to strike targets more than 1,000 miles away with pinpoint accuracy.\u201d A few days later, CNN correspondent Tom Foreman (9/2/13) told viewers: \u201cCruise missiles are extraordinary weapons. They\u2019re very reliable. They have pinpoint accuracy.\u201d\n\n\u2013The Richard Cohen Award: Richard Cohen\n\nThe Washington Post columnist attempted to write a piece (11/11/13) about the GOP and racism\u2013but wound up revealing his own: \u201cPeople with conventional views must repress a gag reflex when considering the mayor-elect of New York\u2013a white man married to a black woman and with two biracial children\u2026. To cultural conservatives, this doesn\u2019t look like their country at all.\u201d This wasn\u2019t Cohen\u2019s only racist outburst this year; this summer (7/16/13), he said that while he was sorry that Trayvon Martin had been gunned down, he was \u201cwearing a uniform we all recognize.\u201d\n\n\u2013Misremembering Thatcher Award: David Ignatius, John Burns\n\nWhen former conservative British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher died in April, pundits lined up to pay tribute. The Washington Post\u2019s David Ignatius (4/10/13) wrote that he saw Thatcher \u201ctake down the British class system.\u201d He cheered that \u201cthe upper classes became porous\u201d and \u201clife became a Ralph Lauren ad.\u201d And the New York Times\u2018 John Burns (PBS NewsHour, 4/9/13) recalled: \u201cThe Britain I grew up in, in the wake of the Second World War, was a country which was in precipitous decline, which had entirely lost its national self-confidence. And Mrs. Thatcher put that right.\u201d (In the actual England under Thatcher, inequality and poverty increased markedly\u2013Guardian, 4/8/13.)\n\n-\u2018Both Sides\u2019 Want to Cut Social Security Award: David Brooks and Mark Shields\n\nOn the PBS NewsHour (4/12/13), conservative David Brooks thought Barack Obama\u2019s proposal to cut Social Security was \u201cbrave\u201d and a \u201cmove to the center.\u201d And the PBS version of the left, Mark Shields, thought it was \u201cgutsy\u2026. He should get credit for doing something bold and difficult.\u201d\n\n-Short Memory Award: Joe Scarborough\n\nMSNBC\u2018s Joe Scarborough (3/19/13) marked the 10th anniversary of the Iraq invasion by heaping scorn on media outlets like the New York Times that failed to acknowledge their responsibility for leading the country into war: \u201cThe very same people who spent years beating up George Bush were the very ones beating the drum for Iraq\u2019s regime change and Saddam Hussein\u2019s ouster.\u201d\n\nBut 10 years earlier, Scarborough (4/9/03) criticized media for not being pro-war enough: \u201cI doubt that the journalists at the New York Times and NPR or at ABC or at CNN are going to ever admit just how wrong their negative pronouncements were over the past four weeks.\u201d The next day (4/10/03), he declared, \u201cI\u2019m waiting to hear the words \u2018I was wrong\u2019 from some of the world\u2019s most elite journalists, politicians and Hollywood types\u2026. Their wartime predictions were arrogant, they were misguided and they were dead wrong. Maybe, just maybe, these self-anointed critics will learn from their mistakes.\u201d\n\n\u2014Know Your Enemy Award: David Gregory, Michael Grunwald\n\nInterviewing journalist Glenn Greenwald about the Edward Snowden revelations, NBC Meet the Press host David Gregory (6/23/13) offered this question:\n\nTo the extent that you have aided and abetted Snowden, even in his current movements, why shouldn\u2019t you, Mr. Greenwald, be charged with a crime?\n\nOn Twitter, Time correspondent Michael Grunwald (8/17/13) mused: \u201cI can\u2019t wait to write a defense of the drone strike that takes out Julian Assange,\u201d referring to the WikiLeaks editor-in-chief. Grunwald later deleted the tweet (NewYorker.com, 8/18/13), citing the argument that \u201cit gives Assange supporters a nice safe persecution complex to hide in.\u201d\n\n\u2013Everyone (I Know) Is Rich: David Gregory\n\nDuring a discussion of the Affordable Care Act (aka \u201cObamacare\u201d), NBC\u2018s Meet the Press host David Gregory (7/7/13) said that while he wasn\u2019t sure how the law would work out, he did know one thing: \u201cAnybody who gets a paycheck in this country understands one thing, that there\u2019s a new line item. And it says Medicare surtax.\u201d\n\nActually, that additional Medicare tax doesn\u2019t apply to \u201canybody who gets a paycheck\u201d\u2014it applies to people making over $200,000, who are in the top 2 percent of household income.\n\n\u2013Ask the Bosses: Fareed Zakaria\n\nFareed Zakaria dedicated a portion of his October 13 CNN show to a discussion of income inequality and the second anniversary of Occupy Wall Street. But he didn\u2019t bring any Occupy activists or advocates for the poor to the discussion; instead, he talked with three CEOs: Goldman Sachs\u2019 Lloyd Blankfein, Duke Energy\u2019s Jim Rogers and Digicel\u2019s Denis O\u2019Brien.\n\n\u2013Not Enough Skyscrapers Award: AP\u2019s Pamela Sampson\n\nAfter the death of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, Associated Press business reporter Pamela Sampson (3/5/13) offered this assessment:\n\nChavez invested Venezuela\u2019s oil wealth into social programs including state-run food markets, cash benefits for poor families, free health clinics and education programs. But those gains were meager compared with the spectacular construction projects that oil riches spurred in glittering Middle Eastern cities, including the world\u2019s tallest building in Dubai and plans for branches of the Louvre and Guggenheim museums in Abu Dhabi.\n\nThat\u2019s right\u2013who would want to provide for the poor when you could build a really tall building?\n\n\u2013Big News Out of Iran Award: Brian Williams\n\nThe NBC Nightly News anchor (9/27/13) saw a big shift coming from new Iranian president Hassan Rouhani: \u201cThis is all part of a new leadership effort by Iran, suddenly claiming they don\u2019t want nuclear weapons.\u201d That \u201csudden\u201d shift is nonexistent, though\u2013Iran\u2019s leaders have long made the same claim that they are not seeking nuclear weapons. In fact, Williams knows this\u2013he reported it himself, once telling viewers (9/19/06) that the previous president\u2019s claim that Iran was \u201cnot working to manufacture a bomb\u201d was also \u201ca new stance that we witnessed here today.\u201d\n\n\u2013Send a Union-Busting Message Award: Chris Matthews\n\nDuring a discussion about how the Obama administration should control the scandals swirling around the White House, MSNBC\u2018s Chris Matthews (Hardball, 5/14/13) brought up one president who did it right: Ronald Reagan, when he broke the PATCO air traffic controllers union in 1981:\n\nI think actions speak louder than words. And I got to tell you something. When Reagan broke the PATCO strike and fired them all for breaking their oaths, everybody in the world, including the people in Moscow, got the word\u2026. It\u2019s one of the reasons we ended the Cold War, because they knew we had a strong president.\n\n\u2013Deadly Website Award: Michael Shear\n\nThe botched rollout of the Healthcare.gov website was certainly widely covered, but it was New York Times reporter Michael Shear who thought it could be compared to a deadly hurricane that killed nearly 2,000 people (11/15/13):\n\nThe disastrous rollout of his health care law\u2026raises questions about his competence in the same way that the Bush administration\u2019s botched response to Hurricane Katrina undermined any semblance of Republican efficiency.\n\nWho exactly was raising this question? Shear attributes it to\u2026a former adviser to George W. Bush. But the website = Katrina line was soon everywhere\u2013which seemed absurd, until NBC\u2018s David Gregory explained that the more apt comparison would be the Iraq War (FAIR Blog, 11/18/13).", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "FAIR", "description": "Some of the year's stinkiest moments in corporate media-- it's the 2013 P.U.-Litzers!", "title": "The 2013 P.U.-Litzers", "url": "http://fair.org/take-action/media-advisories/the-2013-p-u-litzers/", "image": "http://fair.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/pu2013slider.jpg", "type": "article"}, "article": {"section": "Media Advisory", "published_time": "2013-12-27", "modified_time": "2014-03-14", "author": "http://fair.org/author/peter/"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary"}, "description": "Some of the year's stinkiest moments in corporate media-- it's the 2013 P.U.-Litzers!", "google-site-verification": "pCl34NejY1VEHc5CT-okaKYhVr4ZfSS3FkoYFM7aP7Q"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc99ea\"", "article_summary": "\u2013Perfect Weapons Award: Brooke Baldwin, Tom ForemanWhen it appeared that the US would carry out a military attack on Syria, some CNN reporters stepped right into Pentagon PR mode.\nAnd Mrs. Thatcher put that right.\u201d (In the actual England under Thatcher, inequality and poverty increased markedly\u2013Guardian, 4/8/13.)\nIt\u2019s one of the reasons we ended the Cold War, because they knew we had a strong president.\nThat\u2019s right\u2013who would want to provide for the poor when you could build a really tall building?\nBut the website = Katrina line was soon everywhere\u2013which seemed absurd, until NBC\u2018s David Gregory explained that the more apt comparison would be the Iraq War (FAIR Blog, 11/18/13)."}
