We have 47 dead and 79 injured,\u201d national police spokesman Emmanuel Ojukwu said, adding that Boko Haram was believed to be responsible.\n\nOjukwu also confirmed local media reports that the bomber was disguised as a student at the school, which has more than 1,000 pupils aged 15 to 20.\n\nYobe state governor Ibrahim Gaidam ordered the immediate closure of all public schools in the Potiskum area and slammed the government in Abuja for failing to tackle the insurgency.\n\n\u201cUrgent action must be taken right now to restore a fast-waning public confidence by doing whatever it takes to stop the escalating violence,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\n\u2013 Blood-stained uniforms \u2013\n\nStudent Adamu Abdullahi said those at the centre of the blast near the principal\u2019s office were flung in all directions and others were knocked off their feet.\n\n\u201cI found myself under the weight of another student, who fell over me. I\u2019m certain he was dead. I was dazed and disorientated for a moment,\u201d he told AFP.\n\n\u201cWhen I realised what had happened, I managed to push the body on top of me and started running like everyone else. It was confusion all over. Everybody was hysterical.\n\n\u201cI saw many people on the ground. Human flesh and blood were splattered all over the place\u2026 I ran out of the school and went home.\n\n\u201cWhen my father saw me he was terrified. I didn\u2019t realise my white school uniform was stained with human blood and bits of flesh.\u201d\n\nThe dead and injured were taken to the Potiskum General Hospital just 100 metres (yards) away.\n\nBoko Haram, which wants to create a hardline Islamic state in northern Nigeria, has previously carried out deadly attacks on schools teaching a so-called Western curriculum.\n\nIn February, gunmen killed at least 40 students after throwing explosives into the dormitory of a government boarding school in Buni Yadi, also in Yobe state.\n\nIn July last year, 42 students were killed when Boko Haram stormed dormitories in a gun and bomb attack on a government boarding school in the village of Mamudo, near Potiskum.\n\nBoko Haram\u2019s most high-profile attack on a school came in April, when fighters kidnapped 276 girls from the town of Chibok in Borno state, also in northeast Nigeria.\n\nMore than six months later, 219 of the girls are still being held.\n\nMonday\u2019s attack will again raise concerns about the level of security at schools in northern Nigeria \u2014 Abdullahi said the establishment was \u201cnot properly fenced\u201d.\n\n\u2013 Relentless violence \u2013\n\nPotiskum has been repeatedly targeted in deadly attacks blamed on Boko Haram, including last Monday, when a suicide bombing killed at least 15 at a Shiite religious ceremony.\n\nYobe is one of three northeastern states that has been under a state of emergency since May last year.\n\nBut violence has continued unabated and Boko Haram has seized at least two dozen towns and villages in recent months, raising doubts about the government\u2019s ability to control the region.\n\nGovernor Gaidam said President Goodluck Jonathan \u201chas a very urgent responsibility to explain\u2026 why murderous and callous insurgent and criminal attacks are still on the rise\u201d.\n\nBoko Haram fighters were seen in a new video obtained by AFP on Sunday parading a tank in an unidentified town that they apparently now control and Shekau preaching to locals.\n\nThe message in the 44-minute video appeared to be aimed at reinforcing Shekau\u2019s claim that he has created a caliphate within Nigeria.\n\nShekau, who has previously expressed solidarity with other jihadi groups and leaders, seemed to associate territory under his control with a wider, global caliphate.\n\nBut he does not submit to the authority of any other leader.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Boko-Haram-leader-Abubakar-Shekau-800x430.jpg", "height": 430}, "title": "Boko Haram suspected after suicide bomber kills 47 at Nigeria school"}, "fb": {"app_id": 212555972273585}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd136a\"", "article_summary": "We have 47 dead and 79 injured,\u201d national police spokesman Emmanuel Ojukwu said, adding that Boko Haram was believed to be responsible.\nThe massacre came just a day after the release of a new Boko Haram video in which the Islamist group\u2019s leader, Abubakar Shekau, again rejected Nigerian government claims of a ceasefire and peace talks.\nBut violence has continued unabated and Boko Haram has seized at least two dozen towns and villages in recent months, raising doubts about the government\u2019s ability to control the region.\nBoko Haram, which wants to create a hardline Islamic state in northern Nigeria, has previously carried out deadly attacks on schools teaching a so-called Western curriculum.\nBoko Haram fighters were seen in a new video obtained by AFP on Sunday parading a tank in an unidentified town that they apparently now control and Shekau preaching to locals."}
