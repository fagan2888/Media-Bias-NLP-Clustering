Insurers insist it will cause malpractice premiums to skyrocket and force many doctors to relocate out of California. Trial lawyers say it would simply allow more malpractice victims to recover just compensation.Amid all the campaign rhetoric, locally, there is one group who is hoping that Prop. 46 will pass: residents of Santa Clara County and San Mateo County who feel they were wronged when the damages they were permitted to recover in their medical malpractice claims was capped by the state legislature at $250,000.Past malpractice victims like Bob Pack, a Sunnyvale resident whose two preteen children were killed by a driver to whom HMO doctors had overprescribed painkillers, won\u2019t benefit directly if Proposition 46 passes. However, Pack, who is co-sponsoring the initiative, is committed to raising the cap to \u201cincrease doctors\u2019 accountability\u201d and make it easier for future victims to be fairly compensated.Proposition 46 proponents point to Robyn Frankel, a Menlo Park woman, who suffered a medical crisis during a routine medical procedure that rendered her a quadriplegic. Frankel, who died of her injuries in 2013, was no longer able to care for her two pre-teen children and required around-the-clock care.\n\nFrankel\u2019s $6 million verdict for pain and suffering by a Santa Clara County jury in 2012 was reduced by the cap to $250,000. If Proposition 46 had been in effect, the award would have still been reduced, but to $1.1 million.\n\nThe jurors were \u201cmortified\u201d after trial when they learned of the reduction, said Jeff Mitchell, her trial lawyer and one of the top medical malpractice attorneys. Under state law, jurors are not informed of the cap on damages during trial.\u201cIf this type of case were brought in a state like New York or Illinois [that has not imposed a cap], it would settle for $20 million, Mitchell said.When medical malpractice victims like Frankel do not receive enough in a settlement to cover their care, taxpayers end up picking up the bill, local lawyers explained.Hal Dasinger, vice president of government relations for The Doctors Company, the leading medical malpractice insurer in the state, said that passage of Proposition 46 would likely increase claims and have an \u201ceffect on premiums, on the availability of care, particularly specialty care, in those specialties that already pay high premiums\u201d like ob-gyn. Proponents like Wade Westhoff dismiss this concern, noting that a higher cap might actually reduce both premiums and claims by helping doctors \u201clearn from their mistakes.\u201dThe cap oftentimes deters lawyers from taking on worthy cases.Westhoff, whose 21-month-old daughter died in a 2013 surgery to cure a birth defect, had his malpractice case turned down by five different Bay Area attorneys because \u201cit just wouldn\u2019t make [economic] sense with the\u2026 $250,000 cap.\u201d He was only able to retain a lawyer from the Los Angeles area.\u201cWe couldn\u2019t believe we were getting kicked in the gut after getting our heart ripped out [in] losing our daughter,\u201d said Westhoff, a certified financial planner whose case for wrongful death is currently pending.Since it can cost up to $150,000 just for the expert witness fees and court costs involved in trying a case in the Bay Area, the current $250,000 cap on pain and suffering damages makes it economically impractical for many to file cases, noted local attorney Bradley Corsiglia, a top medical malpractice lawyer.Mitchell explained how he \u201cturns down 500 cases for every one that I take\u201d in the Bay Area because the $250,000 cap frequently makes the costs of litigating them more than the potential recovery. He stressed how the cap \u201cdisenfranchises 90 percent of the people who have meritorious malpractice claims\u201d because it makes their cases \u201ceconomically unfeasible.\u201dClaire McCormack, a Redwood City attorney whose three-year-old daughter Nora died in 2013 due to what she described as \u201ccompletely basic, preventable errors\u201d when being treated for septic shock, is still trying to find a malpractice attorney to take what is referred to by some attorneys as a \u201c250 case\u201d \u2014 one where the potential recovery is capped at $250,000.Pack \u2014 who was instrumental in putting this measure on the ballot \u2014 had his own case turned down by eight different attorneys.\u201c[The cap] victimized our family a second time\u2026by putting a value of $250,000 on the life of a child,\u201d he said. Although several doctors at the same HMO prescribed \u201cthousands of Vicodin pills\u201d to the driver who killed his two children, they were \u201cnot even disciplined,\u201d let alone held accountable in court because of the cap, he said.The most recent Field Poll taken Oct. 31 shows Proposition 46 trailing 49 percent to 32 percent. But if the measure does pass, it would take effect on Jan. 1.(Homepage image courtesy of \u201cjasleen_kaur\u201d on Flickr via Creative Commons.)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Peninsula Press", "description": "Debate over whether to adjust the $250,000 pain and suffering cap in medical malpractice lawsuits for inflation is pitting insurance companies against trial lawyers, each with different views of Prop. 46's implications.", "title": "Prior malpractice victims urge passage of Proposition 46 to aid future plaintiffs - Peninsula Press", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://peninsulapress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/stethoscope_flickr.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-11-03T23:50:43+00:00", "url": "http://peninsulapress.com/2014/11/01/proposition-46-california/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PeninsuPress", "section": "Health", "tag": "Wade Westhoff", "published_time": "2014-11-01T10:21:28+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-03T23:50:43+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Debate over whether to adjust the $250,000 pain and suffering cap in medical malpractice lawsuits for inflation is pitting insurance companies against trial lawyers, each with different views of Prop. 46's implications.", "creator": "@PeninsuPress", "image": "http://peninsulapress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/stethoscope_flickr.jpg", "title": "Prior malpractice victims urge passage of Proposition 46 to aid future plaintiffs - Peninsula Press", "site": "@PeninsuPress", "card": "summary"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.2.4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7ee0\"", "article_summary": "If Proposition 46 had been in effect, the award would have still been reduced, but to $1.1 million.\nTrial lawyers say it would simply allow more malpractice victims to recover just compensation.Amid all the campaign rhetoric, locally, there is one group who is hoping that Prop.\nThe jurors were \u201cmortified\u201d after trial when they learned of the reduction, said Jeff Mitchell, her trial lawyer and one of the top medical malpractice attorneys.\nInsurers insist it will cause malpractice premiums to skyrocket and force many doctors to relocate out of California.\nThe debate over whether to adjust the $250,000 pain and suffering cap in medical malpractice lawsuits for inflation is pitting insurance companies against trial lawyers, each offering their own versions of what passage of Proposition 46 would mean."}
