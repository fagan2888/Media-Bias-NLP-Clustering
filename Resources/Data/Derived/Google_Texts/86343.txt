A trial starting Tuesday in Montgomery could determine the future of what was once Alabama's largest casino.

VictoryLand casino in Shorter has been closed since Alabama Attorney General Luther Strange raided it in February 2013.

A civil trial starting Tuesday will determine whether the state can destroy the 1,615 gambling machines seized in the raid and keep the $223,405 in cash that was confiscated.

Strange says the games are illegal slot machines that should be destroyed.

VictoryLand attorney Joe Espy says an amendment to Alabama's constitution allows all forms of bingo to be played in Macon County, including games on machines, and the seized machines played bingo. He says VictoryLand will take the position it is entitled to reopen if the judge rules in its favor.
