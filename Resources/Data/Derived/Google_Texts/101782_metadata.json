Led by Representative Mark Meadows, the conservatives would bring up a rarely-used procedural motion calling for the election of a new speaker. If 30 or more Republicans opposed Boehner, he\u2019d need Democratic votes to defeat the motion and retain the speakership.\n\nIt\u2019s a nearly unprecedented choice for Democrats, and one that the party is just now beginning to contemplate. Would they bail out a man who has stymied nearly all of their legislative priorities for five years? Or would they allow Republicans to depose their own leader\u2014a move that might carry political advantages for Democrats but would almost certainly bring about a period of chaos in the House?\n\nOrdinarily, there would be nothing to think about. The biannual vote for speaker is the first the House takes once it convenes after an election, and it is by nature the most partisan: That tally is what formally determines which party controls the majority, and nearly all members simply vote for their own leader. Ousting a speaker in the middle of a term, by contrast, hasn\u2019t been done in more than a century, and if Meadows or another Republican forced a vote on what\u2019s known as a \u201cmotion to vacate the chair,\u201d the choice facing Democrats would be Boehner or another Republican, who would almost certainly be more conservative.\n\nBy and large, Democrats have longed viewed Boehner as an affable but ineffective speaker. He wants to make deals on issues like immigration and the deficit, but he\u2019s lacked either the political courage or the salesmanship to overcome conservative opposition in his party. \u201cI think most Democrats think the alternative would be worse,\u201d said Representative John Yarmuth, a Kentucky Democrat. Yarmuth told me on Friday that he could see himself voting to keep Boehner in office if it came to it. But his thinking is far from the consensus within the party. Another House Democrat, Gerry Connolly of Virginia, told me it would be \u201cuntenable\u201d for any Democrat to vote for Boehner. \u201cNo Democrat,\u201d he said, \u201ccould go home and say he or she voted for a Republican speaker.\u201d One possible way out for Democrats would be to vote present; because only a majority of those voting is needed, that would lower the bar enough for Boehner to survive as speaker with Republican votes alone. Democrats would, in that case, have kept him afloat without directly voting for him.\n\n\u201cNo Democrat could go home and say he or she voted for a Republican speaker.\u201d\n\nBoehner has voiced confidence he\u2019ll survive a challenge, but reports are rampant that Republicans beneath him are already jockeying for the position in the event of a new leadership race. The Republican next in line is Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California, but while some conservatives might prefer him to Boehner, others are likely to push for someone less tied to the establishment and with more credibility on the right.\n\nA floor challenge to Boehner is unlikely to come before October and might well depend on whether he leads Republicans into another government shutdown after federal funding runs out on September 30. Conservatives in the House Freedom Caucus, a relatively new group of hard-right lawmakers, have said they won\u2019t vote for any spending bill that includes money for Planned Parenthood. President Obama has vowed to veto any attempt to defund the women\u2019s health organization, and such a bill would almost certainly be filibustered in the Senate before it reached his desk. (Even Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, has deemed the effort foolhardy.)", "article_metadata": {"description": "If conservatives try to overthrow the speaker, it might be up to Nancy Pelosi and her colleagues to save him.", "author": "Russell Berman", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "If conservatives try to overthrow the speaker, it might be up to Nancy Pelosi and her colleagues to rescue him.", "title": "John Boehner Might Need Democrats to Save His Job", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2015/09/AP_164132358152/facebook.jpg?1442604918", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/09/will-democrats-rescue-john-boehner/406204/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0383\"", "article_summary": "If John Boehner survives this autumn as speaker, he may owe his job to Democrats.\nAnother House Democrat, Gerry Connolly of Virginia, told me it would be \u201cuntenable\u201d for any Democrat to vote for Boehner.\nIf 30 or more Republicans opposed Boehner, he\u2019d need Democratic votes to defeat the motion and retain the speakership.\nBy and large, Democrats have longed viewed Boehner as an affable but ineffective speaker.\n\u201cI think most Democrats think the alternative would be worse,\u201d said Representative John Yarmuth, a Kentucky Democrat."}
