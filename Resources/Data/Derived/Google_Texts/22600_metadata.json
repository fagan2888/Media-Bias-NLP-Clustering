What we have learned throughout the 20th century is in fact the micromanagement, central planning of complex societies doesn\u2019t work.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to assure brother Williams that there is no schadenfreude because I\u2019m not even pretending to be sorrowful,\u201d Will continued. \u201cOf course I want Obamacare to fail, because if it doesn\u2019t fail, it will just further entangle American society with a government that is not up to this. For 100 years, Juan, the narratives of progressives from Woodrow Wilson on, is that progress will come if and only if we concentrate more and more power in Washington, more and more Washington power in the executive branch and more executive power in the hands of experts \u2014 disinterested experts such as those who designed HealthCare.gov.\u201d\n\nFollow Jeff on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Jeff Poor", "description": "Columnist warns if health care reform law doesn't fail, power will shift to 'disinterested experts such as those who designed Healthcare.gov'", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Washington Post columnist George Will said he wants Obamacare to fail, pointing the impossibility of controlling one-sixth of the economy with central planning after his\u00a0co-panelist Juan Williams dec", "title": "George Will: \u2018Of course I want Obamacare to fail\u2019 [VIDEO]", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2013/10/27/george-will-of-course-i-want-obamacare-to-fail-video/", "image": {"width": 636, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Will1027-e1382894939205.jpg", "height": 273}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Columnist warns power may shift to 'disinterested experts such as those who designed HealthCare.gov'", "title": "George Will: \u2018Of course I want Obamacare to fail\u2019 [VIDEO] Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2013/10/27/george-will-of-course-i-want-obamacare-to-fail-video/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Will1027-e1382894939205.jpg"}, "creator": "@jeff_poor", "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-10-27 14:46:20", "sailthru.title": "George Will: 'Of course I want Obamacare to fail' [VIDEO]", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "sailthru.tags": "jeff-poor", "sailthru.description": "Washington Post columnist George Will said he wants Obamacare to fail, pointing the impossibility of controlling one-sixth of the economy with central planning after his\u00a0co-panelist Juan Williams dec", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Will1027-e1382894939205.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe101f\"", "article_summary": "\u201cOf course I want Obamacare to fail, because if it doesn\u2019t fail, it will just further entangle American society with a government that is not up to this.\n3932164Washington Post columnist George Will said he wants Obamacare to fail, pointing the impossibility of controlling one-sixth of the economy with central planning after his co-panelist Juan Williams declared Republicans did not want the law to work.\n\u201c And people, \u2018Oh yeah, you know, isn\u2019t it terrible \u2014 oh my gosh, Obamacare is having trouble.\u2019 Come on, Republicans don\u2019t want this thing to work.\n\u201c[Y]ou know, I just think there is a lot of schadenfreude on the panel this morning,\u201d Williams said.\nThat\u2019s the reality here.\u201dLater, Will predicted the demise of Obamacare and said he wanted the law to fail for fear of how it will further change Washington, D.C. as the central focus of power in the United States."}
