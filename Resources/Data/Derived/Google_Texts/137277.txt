In this Christmas season, we can follow Jesus’ example.

Our heart beats about 100,000 times every day, pumping blood to every cell in our bodies. This adds up to about 35 million beats in a year and 2.5 billion beats in an average lifetime.

Medical science tells us that every contraction is similar to the effort it would take for us to hold a tennis ball in our palm and give it a good, hard squeeze. Yet as amazing as our heart is, it’s only one example of a natural world that is designed to tell us something about our creator and savior.

The word “heart” is used hundreds of times in the Bible. Jesus, when asked what’s the most important thing in the world, responded by saying, “The first of all commandments is ... you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind and with all your strength. And the second, like it, is this: ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself. There is no other commandment greater than these.’” (Mark 12:31).

At this wonderful time of the year, there’s something more lasting and appreciative than giving gifts to family and friends at Christmas. Our love to others will far outlast and mean more than the finest gift we could choose.

Jesus Christ, our powerful and victorious savior, came as a helpless and innocent baby to offer us his love and hope and asks us to invite him into our spiritual hearts. His warm love has changed cold hearts and the world.

This joyous season is our opportunity to start to follow his example throughout the new year.
