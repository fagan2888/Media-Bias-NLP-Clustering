Biden goes 'kablooie' in video

President Barack Obama has his selfie stick, and now Vice President Joe Biden has autotune.

Not to be outdone by the president’s goofy BuzzFeed video — which saw more than 22 million hits in barely a day — Biden is starring in a new Valentine’s Day-themed YouTube clip. Like the commander-in-chief, the vice president is trying to encourage people to sign up for health insurance before this weekend’s enrollment deadline.

The video features The Gregory Brothers, a group known for autotuning news clips and other Internet oddities — and the posting doesn’t disappoint. Spliced into Biden’s message is a toothy young boy named Griffin, who starts to describe his first kiss. Suddenly it’s all a pop song. It seems to go on a long time.

Two minutes into the video, Biden is suddenly back to get to the real point.

“Your health and well-being is the best gift you can give your parents or anyone else who loves you out there, so go check out HealthCare.gov, and pick a plan that’s best fit for you,” Biden tells one of those Gregory Brothers. “I think you’re going to find that it’s more affordable than your cell phone bill.

“Kablooie.”
