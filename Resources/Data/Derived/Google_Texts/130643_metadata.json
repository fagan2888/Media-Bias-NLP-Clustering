With Harry Reid demanding that the upper chamber simply \"move on\" without even considering the consequential geopolitical agreement, Mitch McConnell is warning that an ongoing filibuster will result in the introduction of several amendments designed to make Reid's caucus squirm:\n\n\n\n\n\nMcConnell Amendment Would Link Lifting Sanctions to #Iran\u2019s Recognition of #Israel, Release of American Prisoners http://t.co/Qt7eLXhS3z \u2014 Sen. McConnell Press (@McConnellPress) September 15, 2015\n\n\u201cDemocrats seem to think they can end the discussion by blocking an up-or-down vote, then turn around and pretend they care deeply about Israel and human rights. Well if they vote again to deny the American people a final vote, they\u2019ll have a chance to test the theory. I will file on an amendment that would prevent the President from lifting sanctions until Iran meets two simple benchmarks: It must formally recognize Israel\u2019s right to exist, and it must release the American citizens being held in Iranian custody. The President has so far resisted linking his deal \u2014 a deal that fails to end Iran\u2019s enrichment program, while leaving it as an American-recognized nuclear threshold state \u2014 to other aspects of Iran\u2019s conduct. But linkage is appropriate, and in this negotiation would have been wise. \u201cIndeed, Senators say they understand the importance of standing up for an ally like Israel in a dangerous region, and the Senate voted unanimously just a few months ago in calling for Iranian leaders to release those Americans.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Escalation..05/26/2016 18:25:52PM EST.", "author": "Guy Benson", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Escalation.", "title": "Guy Benson - McConnell to Dems: I'll Force Painful Amendments If You Keep Filibustering the Iran Deal", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/guybenson/2015/09/15/mcconnell-iran-move-n2052829", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/125/8d9ca50a-a042-4424-9606-edebd1a24fde.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Escalation.", "title": "Guy Benson - McConnell to Dems: I'll Force Painful Amendments If You Keep Filibustering the Iran Deal", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/guybenson/2015/09/15/mcconnell-iran-move-n2052829", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/125/8d9ca50a-a042-4424-9606-edebd1a24fde.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "McConnell to Dems: I'll Force Painful Amendments If You Keep Filibustering the Iran Deal, Guy Benson, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "As I reported on Friday, Senate Republican leaders are applying new pressure to their Democratic colleagues who filibustered a vote on President Obama's unpopular, unilateral Iran deal last week.\nWell if they vote again to deny the American people a final vote, they\u2019ll have a chance to test the theory.\nThe President has so far resisted linking his deal \u2014 a deal that fails to end Iran\u2019s enrichment program, while leaving it as an American-recognized nuclear threshold state \u2014 to other aspects of Iran\u2019s conduct.\nBut linkage is appropriate, and in this negotiation would have been wise.\nI will file on an amendment that would prevent the President from lifting sanctions until Iran meets two simple benchmarks: It must formally recognize Israel\u2019s right to exist, and it must release the American citizens being held in Iranian custody."}
