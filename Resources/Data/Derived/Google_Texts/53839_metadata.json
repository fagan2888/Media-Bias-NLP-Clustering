And in the latest move to build momentum, Republican Sen. Dean Heller of Nevada and Democratic Sen. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico on Thursday unveiled the \u201cMiddle Class Health Benefits Tax Repeal Act\u201d to target the tax for extinction.\n\nRelated: Obamacare's Cadillac Tax Hits the College Campus\n\n\u201cImposing a devastating tax on the 1.3 million Nevadans receiving employer-sponsored health insurance is a terrible idea,\u201d Heller said in a statement. \u201cHardworking Nevadans employed in the restaurant and tourism industry, to public employees, to small business owners, and retirees will all face the effects of the \u2018Cadillac Tax.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cDoing away with this onerous tax on employees\u2019 health coverage before it goes into effect will protect important benefits for workers and ensure businesses and families get a fair deal,\u201d Heinrich added.\n\nWhile much of the controversy over Obamacare has focused on the government\u2019s cost of providing subsidized health insurance plans to millions of previously uninsured Americans, opposition has been simmering for months over the administration\u2019s plan for financing a substantial portion of the overall program with a stiff tax on higher-end policies provided by insurers and union organizations.\n\nBeginning in 2018, health plans that cost over $10,200 for an individual or $27,500 for a family plan will be subject to the tax, according to an analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation. The tax is 40 percent of the amount that exceeds those thresholds. Case in point: If a family plan costs $30,000, the employer offering the plan would have to pay 40 percent of the $2,500 above the threshold, or $1,000 for each family it covers under that plan.\n\nRelated: How Obamacare Will Impact Your Taxes\n\nAlthough there are still two years before the tax begins to bit, many businesses already have begun making plans for the tax, according to Bloomberg, and are considering scaling back health benefits for their upper income employees while paying strict attention to Internal Revenue Service rules.\n\nAn estimated one third of employers would be subject to paying the new tax in 2018 unless they adjust their insurance plans.\n\nMallory Micetich, a spokesperson for the National Coalition of Benefits, warned today, \u201cAbsent repeal, the 40 percent tax will slow private sector health care innovation and erode the value of the employer-sponsored health care benefits upon which more than 150 million Americans currently rely.\u201d\n\nThe tax was included in the Affordable Care act in part as a way to contain long-term health costs and reduce the benefit of a major federal tax provision that excuses employer-provided health insurance from income and payroll taxes, Bloomberg notes. But it also would be a huge revenue generator, raising an estimated $87 billion for the Treasury over the coming decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\n\nRelated: Sisyphus on the Potomac: The Senate Pushes Tax Reform Up a Long, Steep Hill\n\nJoseph Antos, a health care expert with the American Enterprise Institute, said that repeal of the tax is \u201cpretty much a bipartisan issue,\u201d although Republicans and Democrats may have sharply differing views on how to offset the tens of billions of dollars of lost revenue. Moreover, Congress might consider something short of full abolition of the tax, such as indexing so that the Cadillac tax doesn\u2019t hit everyone.\n\n\u201cIf it weren\u2019t a matter of money the tax would have been gone by now,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cBut it is a matter of money \u2013 quite a bit of money. And it\u2019s going to be the age old problem of how are they going to pay for it?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Tax reform has been pretty much put off until after the 2016 presidential election, bu", "title": "Bipartisan Support Builds to Repeal Obamacare \u2018Cadillac Tax\u2019", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/09/17/Bipartisan-Support-Builds-Repeal-Obamacare-Cadillac-Tax", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/columns/08202014_Repeal_Obamacare.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/09/17/Bipartisan-Support-Builds-Repeal-Obamacare-Cadillac-Tax", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/columns/08202014_Repeal_Obamacare.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Tax reform has been pretty much put off until after the 2016 presidential election, bu", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Moreover, Congress might consider something short of full abolition of the tax, such as indexing so that the Cadillac tax doesn\u2019t hit everyone.\nAnti-tax Republicans, liberal Democrats and even major labor unions are banding together to try to prevent the so-called \u201cCadillac Tax\u201d from taking effect.\nRelated: Obamacare's Cadillac Tax Hits the College Campus\u201cImposing a devastating tax on the 1.3 million Nevadans receiving employer-sponsored health insurance is a terrible idea,\u201d Heller said in a statement.\nAnd in the latest move to build momentum, Republican Sen.
