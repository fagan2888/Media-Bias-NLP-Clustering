Paul Ryan, the expected new speaker, begins work.\n\n\u201cThis has been a big push from our group,\u201d Rep. Jim Jordan, the Freedom Caucus chairman, told The Daily Signal in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019ve said it for a long time: the process and rule changes need to be done in such a way where they push influence across the conference and across the Congress. We think that environment is more conducive to doing what we told the voters we were gonna do.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd we are already making real progress there.\u201d Jordan added. \u201cWe have had more meetings on the rules the last couple weeks than we\u2019ve had in the eight years I\u2019ve been here.\u201d\n\nSpecifically, Jordan, R-Ohio, believes the conference could come to an agreement before Thursday to broaden member representation of the Steering Committee, a board that makes committee assignments.\n\nFreedom Caucus members and others argue that party leaders and their allies have too much power in how the Steering Committee operates. There are currently 33 Republicans on the Steering Committee. Each member has one vote, except for the speaker, who has five, and the majority leader, who has two.\n\n\u201cWe think it makes sense for there to be an immediate reduction in the number of votes certain members have,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cI think Ryan is very open to changes in the Steering Committee.\u201d\n\nAccording to CQ Roll Call, the Steering Committee is composed of members of elected leadership, representatives from 11 regions, plus the \u201csmall states\u201d and Texas.\n\n\u201cWe are hopeful to get a much broader base for the Steering Committee,\u201d said Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., a Freedom Caucus member, in an interview with The Daily Signal.\n\n\u201cWe want to allow it to be more representative of a larger population of states and not just a region, and for it to not be controlled by the speaker. Yes, the board is independent, but if you are intellectually honest about it, it\u2019s not independent, because the speaker with a wink or nod can encourage people to go in one direction or the other. There is broad support for changing this process.\u201d\n\nIn an hour-long meeting before the Freedom Caucus last week, and in comments to other groups, Ryan, R-Wis., has impressed members with his commitment to changing House process.\n\nThough he has spoken broadly about potential change, and not made specific promises, House leaders for weeks have been meeting with members to discuss ways to move forward.\n\nReps. Mick Mulvaney, R-S.C. and Morgan Griffith, R-Va., have negotiated on behalf of the Freedom Caucus with a diverse spectrum of lawmakers, including members of the moderate Tuesday Group.\n\nOn Tuesday night, Reps. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, the chair of the House Republican Conference, and Luke Messer, chair of the Republican Policy Committee, sent a \u201cdear colleague\u201d letter to members outlining rules changes suggested over several weeks.\n\nIn addition to \u201credefining\u201d the Steering Committee structure, House Republicans are interested in \u201cpromoting regular order\u201d and \u201cempowering individual members through procedures designed to enhance every Republican members\u2019 ability to have their voice heard in the conference.\u201d\n\nMcMorris Rodgers, R-Wash., and Messer, R-Ind., write that specific changes should be voted on quick enough to be implemented the first week of the new year.\n\nThough Freedom Caucus members would welcome changes to be voted on before Ryan is poised to be elected speaker Thursday, they won\u2019t rebuke him if change takes more time.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a deal killer only because Ryan has committed a number of times to process changes,\u201d Meadows said.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s not done [by Thursday], as long it\u2019s specified and directed in a time frame of getting it accomplished, that\u2019s fine. But I know he is working and we are working on seeing the changes through.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "House Republicans are negotiating changes to their official rules that could be voted on before they elect their new speaker Thursday.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "House Republicans are negotiating changes to their official rules that could be voted on before they elect their new speaker Thursday.", "title": "House Republicans Hope for Deal to 'Empower' Rank-and-File", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/RulesChanges.jpg", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1Mtkaxn"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "House Republicans are negotiating changes to their official rules that could be voted on before they elect their new speaker Thursday.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/RulesChanges.jpg"}, "title": "House Republicans Hope for Deal to 'Empower' Rank-and-File", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Featured Topics", "tag": "House of Representatives", "published_time": "2015-10-28T13:01:26+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Paul Ryan, speaker of the House, House Freedom Caucus, rule changes, Jim Jordan, Mark Meadows, Cathy McMorris Rodgers, John Boehner"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThis has been a big push from our group,\u201d Rep.
