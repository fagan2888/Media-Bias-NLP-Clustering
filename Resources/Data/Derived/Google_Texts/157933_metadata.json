That's not as bad as having your news organization banned on Reddit, but it's still gotta hurt.\n\nThe Taliban's critique, below, in full:\n\nYesterday \u2018The Daily Beast\u2019 newspaper, which pursues a malicious intelligence agenda and is run by famous intelligence agents, published a far from reality, purely propaganda based and fabricated report regarding the Islamic Emirate which stated that some leaders of Islamic Emirate had met in the Pakistani city of Islamabad, showed their inclination towards peace and other such nonsense\u2026\u2026. We reject every aspect of this report. The assertions cited by \u2018The Daily Beast\u2019 are contrary to the policy and manifesto of the Islamic Emirate and similarly the talk about conflict between the leaders of Islamic Emirate in also propaganda and devilish scheme of the said newspaper which has no substance. We urge all media outlets to be cautious of such pure propaganda which has no reality to it and is the work of intelligence agencies. We have designated spokesmen and a dedicated website for our activities from where anyone can contact us to attain access to information. Attributing false statements to the Islamic Emirate and associating unknown figures with us violates the basic principles of journalism. In our view these are vengeful attempts by certain identified persons who wish to spread their own personal agendas through these reports and we ask all independent media outlets to refrain from publishing these baseless reports. We would also like to point out that \u2018The Daily Beast\u2019 has on several occasions published such baseless reports to advance their agendas. They also regularly attribute their statements to \u2018Zabiullah\u2019 so as to portray it to be me, Zabihullah Mujahid, the spokesman of Islamic Emirate. The truth is that neither I have ever spoken with this media outlet nor has any other official within the Islamic Emirate ever corresponded with them. The spokesman of Islamic Emirate Zabihullah Mujahid 29/12/1343\n\nLink: \" Remarks of spokesman of Islamic Emirate regarding baseless report by \u2018The Daily Beast\u2019 \" [shahamat-english.com]\n\n(Via Romenesko)", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Boing Boing", "description": "A Daily Beast story about Taliban\u2019s ruling council meeting for peace talks in Pakistan \u201cviolates the basic principles of journalism\u201d and is \u201cnonsense,\u201d according to the Afghan Taliban. \u2026", "title": "Afghan Taliban critiques journalism ethics of The Daily Beast", "url": "http://boingboing.net/2013/11/04/taliban-critiques-journalism-e.html", "image": "http://media.boingboing.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/EN_eid-600x72.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 5971922, "title": "Afghan Taliban critiques journalism ethics of The Daily Beast", "site": "@boingboing", "card": "summary", "description": "Afghan Taliban critiques journalism ethics of The Daily Beast"}, "fb": {"admins": 1219680052}, "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-04T16:23:23+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-04T16:45:19+00:00"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Afghan Taliban critiques journalism ethics of The Daily BeastA Daily Beast story about Taliban\u2019s ruling council meeting for peace talks in Pakistan \u201cviolates the basic principles of journalism\u201d and is \"nonsense,\" according to the Afghan Taliban.\nThe spokesman of Islamic Emirate Zabihullah Mujahid 29/12/1343Link: \" Remarks of spokesman of Islamic Emirate regarding baseless report by \u2018The Daily Beast\u2019 \" [shahamat-english.com](Via Romenesko)\nWe would also like to point out that \u2018The Daily Beast\u2019 has on several occasions published such baseless reports to advance their agendas.\nAttributing false statements to the Islamic Emirate and associating unknown figures with us violates the basic principles of journalism.\nThey also regularly attribute their statements to \u2018Zabiullah\u2019 so as to portray it to be me, Zabihullah Mujahid, the spokesman of Islamic Emirate."}
