Anthony List (SBA List) was victorious in its legal battle against Ohio\u2019s \u201cfalse statement\u201d law, which previously allowed a politically-appointed government panel to determine true or false political speech. Judge Timothy Black ruled in favor of SBA List in the case of Susan B. Anthony List v. Ohio Elections Commission, striking down the Ohio law as unconstitutional, and leaving the SBA List and others free to engage in the public square without fear of prosecution.\n\n\u201cAfter four years and a trip to the U.S. Supreme Court, today we finally have a victory for free speech,\u201d said SBA List President Marjorie Dannenfelser.\n\nJudge Black quoted this statement from the SBA List oral arguments in his decision: \u201c[We are not] arguing for a right to lie. We\u2019re arguing that we have a right not to have the truth of our political statements be judged by the Government.\u201d\n\nPreviously the U.S. Supreme Court ruled unanimously that the SBA List had standing to continue its First Amendment challenge to the Ohio law. Similar laws exist in 15 other states.\n\n\u201cThis summer more than twenty groups from across the political spectrum submitted amicus briefs to the U.S. Supreme Court on behalf of SBA List. The ACLU, the Cato Institute, and even President Obama\u2019s own Solicitor General supported our fight for the right to criticize elected officials,\u201d continued Dannenfelser.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s decision allows us to freely communicate the truth with voters \u2013 that elected representatives who voted for the Affordable Care Act voted for taxpayer-funded abortion. It is beyond dispute that, because Congress and the White House failed to include the Stupak amendment, ObamaCare contains multiple abortion-funding provisions. This reality will continue to be a key part of our message to voters in the 2014 midterm elections and beyond.\u201d\n\nThe case was spurred by SBA List\u2019s 2010 attempt to put up billboards exposing that former Rep. Steve Driehaus (D-OH) supported taxpayer-funded abortion by voting for the Affordable Care Act. Last week, the Susan B. Anthony List launched a similar billboard campaign in Louisiana to expose Senator Mary Landrieu for her vote for taxpayer funded abortion. Like Driehaus, Senator Landrieu voted for the Affordable Care Act.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Pro-Life Group Wins as Judge Strikes Radical Law Prohibiting Pro-Life Free Speech", "og": {"site_name": "LifeNews.com", "description": "Today the national pro-life group Susan B.
