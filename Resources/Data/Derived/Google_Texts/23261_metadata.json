Thus, a hero was born.\n\n\u201cThere has been this resurgence of the superhero in general,\u201d she told Mashable. \u201cBut it\u2019s always like this save-the-world, huge thing, and I think that people have, every day, these moments where they just wish they had an extra bit of help.\u201d\n\nAn intimate crowd gathered at the Museum of Contemporary Art on Thursday night for the world premiere of series, which debuted to the masses on Friday on MOCAtv, the museum\u2019s digital media extension that has amassed more than 5 million views and 150,000 subscribers.\n\nMOCA showcased the first four episodes of Lambert\u2019s project, which features Armisen and Jack Black in a part sketch comedy, part artistic commentary series, at the event as well as sets by Armisen\u2019s SNL British punk persona Ian Rubbish and video artist Dynasty Handbag.\n\n\u201cYou gotta do it all by the rules. That\u2019s sort of the beauty of art, is that there\u2019s a misconception that you should not have guidelines, but I believe you do need them,\u201d Armisen as Rubbish said before his set on Thursday. \u201cYou need rules, because without that you\u2019ve got the kind of art they make in Amsterdam or whatever. Really shit art.\u201d\n\nThe tongue-in-cheek statement spread a subversive pall over the evening, which was rife with unconventional, eccentric and oblique art.\n\nArt + Comedy = Blurred Lines\n\nAmbiance Man is part of MOCA\u2019s inaugural Art + Comedy season, which draws upon and references the art historical tradition of comedic performances by contemporary artists. This year\u2019s programming is highlighted by a film digging into the ephemera of Andy Kaufman and his legacy, a celebration of video performer Alex Bag and new films by artists Kate Berlant, Martin Kersels, David Robbins and Dynasty Handbag (Jibz Cameron), a performance artist whose work is increasingly showing up in mainstream comedy.\n\nIn addition to Armisen, the cast includes Black, Peter Macon, Atsuko Okatsuka and Jibz Cameron playing Unidentifiable Odor, Cooke Alistaire, Feng-She and Buzz Kill.\n\nCameron, who plays alongside Black as part of a tag-team of nefarious villains, represents one of the show\u2019s and the series\u2019 most unique assets: a hybrid performance artist-comedian.\n\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m working on my own work it\u2019s just a giant mess and I\u2019m in charge of everything,\u201d Cameron said. \u201cBut the performative part of it was sort of similar in that a lot of times I had a loose narrative and improvised a lot of what I was doing. And so on set \u2026 we knew we had to get from Point A to Point B, but we could kind of do whatever we wanted to get there.\u201d\n\nAs part of the night\u2019s festivities, Cameron debuted a Dynasty Handbag video piece, titled \u201cRemote Penetration,\u201d which blended graphics, music, lewd and slapstick elements into a concoction of off-kilter humor. Cameron also gave a live set that included a sendup of the Christmas song \u201cSanta Baby,\u201d as well as others that critiqued feminism, masculinity and sexuality, among other themes.\n\nReeves noted Cameron as an example of art and comedy bleeding into one another: She is a performance artist, but she\u2019s transitioned gradually into comedy because of her humor.\n\n\u201cWe always wanted to do comedy programming, but there are certainly artists who work in a comedic fashion in the art world and there\u2019s art that has comedic properties,\u201d Reeves added. \u201cWe\u2019re just following that vein and we\u2019re interested in working with artists who are very consciously comedic but wouldn\u2019t call themselves comedians.\u201d\n\nReeves said that the programming is not meant to be empirical, but MOCAtv is viewing the programming more as experimental resources, which will range from miniature pseudo-documentaries to video art pieces to short series like Ambiance Man.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re blurring a lot of lines. It\u2019s all blurred lines,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd who really cares about those definitions anyway? It\u2019s really just an investigation of the comedic effect.\u201d\n\nThe Social Media Experiment\n\nAmbiance Man was entirely shot at YouTube Space LA, a production space in Playa Vista, Calif., geared specifically toward web content creators looking to make their mark on the Internet, as well as on social media, with digital content.\n\nIn the upcoming weeks, MOCAtv will continue to roll out similar digital content from its Art + Comedy slate on its YouTube channel, and Ambiance Man will air its next two episodes, as well as additional tangential content (such as the above AmBeyonc\u00e9 clip), starting on Dec. 27.\n\nMeanwhile, Lambert said that the show is implementing an interactive \u201cexperiment\u201d to galvanize potential fans. Fake Twitter accounts have been created for the show\u2019s main characters to complement the web series and to potentially stretch out the series\u2019 lifespan.\n\nReeves and Lambert said they are also looking to capitalize on YouTube\u2019s popularity, as a means to promote their work, the artists involved and the museum. But the motivation is less mercenary than investigative and enriching.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that it\u2019s important to have a YouTube channel, per se,\u201d Reeves said. \u201cIt\u2019s important that the institution has a very interested attitude toward digital communication, communication generally. \u2026 The attraction with YouTube is that it\u2019s so democratically available, anyone can stumble across this content, it\u2019s searchable, it\u2019s not locked in some website that only Ph.D. graduates know about.\u201d\n\nBoth Reeves and Lambert said that they don\u2019t really care about the numbers Ambiance Man will produce \u2014 those are more of an interesting byproduct. The reason, according to Reeves, is because some of the content is important in an art historical way, so it\u2019s less of a viral phenomenon and more of a resource for academia in the future.\n\nMost telling of all, though, was Armisen, who on his way back out into the rainy streets of Los Angeles, said: \u201cAnything having to do with MOCA is a good thing. \u2026 The Los Angeles art scene is one of my favorite scenes, but the idea of importance is irrelevant. It\u2019s entertaining; all it has to be is entertaining.\u201d\n\nHave something to add to this story?
