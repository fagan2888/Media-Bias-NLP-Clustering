Stanford Law School professor Michael McConnell wrote in a July 2013 Wall Street Journal op-ed that President Obama\u2019s decision to suspend the employer mandate of the Affordable Care Act for a year \u201craises grave concerns about his understanding of the role of the executive in our system of government.\u201d This followed Obama\u2019s effectively decreeing the DREAM Act for illegal immigrants who came as children, which Congress had decided not to pass, and effectively rewriting the No Child Left Behind Act. Since then, he\u2019s suspended Obamacare rules governing \u201csubstandard\u201d health-insurance plans and offered legal status to millions more illegal immigrants.\n\nWe should also recall Obama\u2019s (literally) injudicious decisions to make \u201crecess\u201d appointments to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) when he deemed the Senate \u201cunavailable to conduct business\u201d even though it had been conducting pro forma sessions every three days. In National Labor Relations Board v. Noel Canning, the Supreme Court disagreed with the president, holding that the Senate is in session \u201cwhen it says that it is.\u201d\n\nBut less well known is that the president\u2019s \u201cI know best, so we can ignore the law and due process\u201d mentality has also extended into areas of science-based regulation \u2014 or what should be science-based regulation. Questions of constitutionality aside, his abuses of discretion will incentivize bad behavior among individuals and companies.\n\nAn egregious example is the feds\u2019 treatment of the fast-growing, genetically engineered Atlantic \u201cAquAdvantage\u201d salmon, which reaches maturity twice as rapidly as its wild cohorts. The changes \u2014 the addition of a growth-hormone gene from the Chinook salmon and a regulatory DNA sequence from the ocean pout \u2014 cause no detectable difference in the fish\u2019s appearance, ultimate size, taste, or nutritional value; salmon with these alterations just grow faster, a tremendous economic advantage to those farming the fish in a closed-water system. The availability of such a salmon would also be a tremendous boon to consumers seeking low-fat and affordable sources of protein, especially in the face of food-price inflation and the obesity epidemic.\n\nNormally, the review and approval of such a product would occur routinely in the depths of the FDA\u2019s Center for Food Safety and Nutrition, but the review of the AquAdvantage salmon was hijacked and delayed indefinitely by the Obama administration \u2014 on the advice of an assistant White House chef , no less. The AquAdvantage still has not been approved, even though all the requirements were met in 2013. This ongoing delay is a violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which requires that the Health and Human Services secretary approve the AquaBounty application within six months after all the legal requirements have been met.\n\nAnother example of questionable \u201cenforcement discretion\u201d is the government\u2019s failure to show any interest in the federal and state felonies committed by Cynthia La Pier, a Massachusetts woman who decided to place her own warning labels on certain foods in a local supermarket, a flagrant violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. It would not be a difficult prosecution: On May 24, 2013, the New York Times ran on its front page a photo of the culprit in flagrante delicto, accompanied by an article that identified her and the scene of the crime.\n\nWhat is the reason for this vigilante action? Basically, La Pier and her ilk disapprove of the FDA\u2019s policy of not requiring labels to identify foods that are obtained from plants, animals, and microorganisms that have been genetically altered by the most modern, precise, and predictable genetic techniques. However, the FDA\u2019s policy makes scientific and common sense, and, most important for law enforcement, it is dictated by federal law.\n\nLa Pier is hardly a candidate for the FBI\u2019s Most Wanted List, but the unwillingness of the Department of Justice to investigate such obvious crimes illustrates yet again how enforcement discretion has morphed into all-progressive-politics-all-the-time. The feds are never too busy or resource-poor to selectively investigate and intimidate conservative groups seeking 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status, but they\u2019re uninterested in brazen violations of federal law when it suits them.\n\nJonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington University, testified before the House Judiciary Committee in December 2013 about the threat posed by a president who does not faithfully execute the laws. \u201cThe danger is quite severe,\u201d he told the committee. \u201cThe problem with what the president is doing is that he\u2019s not simply posing a danger to the constitutional system. He\u2019s becoming the very danger the Constitution was designed to avoid.\u201d\n\nThese examples capture perfectly the upside-down mentality of President Obama and his minions: By word and deed, they actually encourage anti-social behavior \u2014 ranging from illegal immigration to vigilantism \u2014 while discouraging innovation and investment in technological research and development.\n\nThere is no justification for a government that abuses executive discretion to further its parochial view of what America should be.\n\n\u2014 Henry I.
