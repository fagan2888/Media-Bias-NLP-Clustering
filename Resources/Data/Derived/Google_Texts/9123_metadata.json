Police say the woman, who stays at a residence in Torrington a few weeks out of the year, first pointed the gun at two civilians, asking if they were cops. The individuals ran away unharmed, WFSB reports.\n\nA short time later, Rothenberg stood in the doorway of the employee entrance in what police described as a \u201cshooting stance\u201d before shouting that she hated cops.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing, shoot me!\u201d she said. \u201cWhat are you scared of?\u201d\n\nAccording to WFSB, Rothenberg then raised the weapon towards police, yelling \u201cboom, boom, boom.\u201d The BB gun used in the incident was purchased earlier that day by Rothenberg \u201cbecause it looked real.\u201d\n\nPolice took Rothenberg into custody without incident, later charging her with first-degree threatening, seven counts of reckless endangerment, interfering with police, and second-degree breach of peace.\n\nWhile Rothenberg will likely be given due process, victims like John Crawford and Tamir Rice \u2014 both Black individuals who were holding toy guns when they were fatally shot by police officers \u2014 weren\u2019t even given a chance.\n\nAnd when you consider that Rice, just a child, did not verbally threaten police or point his toy gun in their direction as Rothenberg had, it\u2019s hard to imagine that police would consider a child in a park more dangerous than a grown woman holding a gun outside of a police station.\n\nA curious case, don\u2019t you agree?\n\nSOURCE: WFSB | PHOTO CREDIT: Getty", "article_metadata": {"pubexchange": {"headline": "\u201cBoom, Boom, Boom:\u201d White Woman Points BB Gun At Cops, Lives To Tell About It", "description": "The arrest of a 66-year-old White woman in Connecticut, who was taken into custody unharmed after pointing a BB gun at police officers, is raising questions about the use of lethal force against people of color following the non-indictment of officers who"}, "description": "Police took Rothenberg into custody without incident.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "Global Grind", "description": "Police took Rothenberg into custody without incident, later charging her with first-degree threatening, seven counts of reckless endangerment and interfering with police and second-degree breach of\u2026", "title": "\u201cBoom, Boom, Boom:\u201d White Woman Points BB Gun At Cops, Lives To Tell About It", "url": "http://globalgrind.com/2015/12/29/white-woman-points-bb-gun-cops-connecticut/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "https://ioneglobalgrind.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/14499934507875.jpg?w=1200", "height": 797}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The arrest of a 66-year-old White woman in Connecticut, who was taken into custody unharmed after pointing a BB gun at police officers, is raising questions about the use of lethal force against peopl", "creator": "@GlobalGrind", "image": {"src": "https://ioneglobalgrind.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/14499934507875.jpg?w=640"}, "title": "\u201cBoom, Boom, Boom:\u201d White Woman Points BB Gun At Cops, Lives To Te", "site": "@GlobalGrind", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "The World According to Hip-Pop", "tp": {"EnableExternalController": "true"}, "fb": {"pages": 8732630162, "app_id": 1612998638912583}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1", "application-name": "Global Grind", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WordPresscom", "published_time": "2015-12-29T18:00:01+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-29T18:17:20+00:00"}, "msvalidate.01": "30473C9E51B1FA7645F80C5736971CF1", "google-site-verification": "x-6a6ICNV5fUNJmw9lIXWM9BCuU5vIWnmirizanBR00", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://globalgrind.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/b6f2d7b5b7fe8b598091e1ad49899990?s=16", "news_keywords": "Tamir Rice, Toy guns, white woman points gun at cops"}, "article_summary": "A short time later, Rothenberg stood in the doorway of the employee entrance in what police described as a \u201cshooting stance\u201d before shouting that she hated cops.\nWitnesses say a woman, later identified as Elaine Rothenberg of North Carolina, was seen walking around the Torrington Police Department with what appeared to be a handgun.\nPolice say the woman, who stays at a residence in Torrington a few weeks out of the year, first pointed the gun at two civilians, asking if they were cops.\nNewsOne StaffThe arrest of a 66-year-old White woman in Connecticut, who was taken into custody unharmed after pointing a BB gun at police officers, is raising questions about the use of lethal force against people of color following the non-indictment of officers who fatally shot a 12-year-old Black child holding a toy gun.\nWhile Rothenberg will likely be given due process, victims like John Crawford and Tamir Rice \u2014 both Black individuals who were holding toy guns when they were fatally shot by police officers \u2014 weren\u2019t even given a chance."}
