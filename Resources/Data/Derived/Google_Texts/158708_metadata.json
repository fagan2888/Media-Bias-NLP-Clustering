Come out of the closet, Mr. Liddick; progressives tolerate different viewpoints more than conservatives.\n\nIn describing these perceived villains, Liddick uses terms like \u201cdesperate,\u201d \u201cloonier,\u201d \u201cself-loathing,\u201d \u201chopelessly ignorant,\u201d \u201cbedbugs,\u201d \u201cvampires,\u201d \u201cclown-shoes stupid,\u201d \u201cunhinged,\u201d \u201cunthinking,\u201d \u201coppressive,\u201d \u201cridiculous,\u201d \u201cdithering,\u201d you get the point.\n\nLiddick makes inaccurate statements that would be laughable, if not so insulting. Once, he implied only conservatives \u201cvalue tradition,\u201d \u201cembrace freedom,\u201d \u201cfollow rules and procedures,\u201d \u201cappreciate market economies,\u201d \u201chonor service to country,\u201d and \u201cdislike spending beyond their means.\u201d To refute just one of those, it was conservative President Bush who inherited a surplus (from a Democratic predecessor), and left a huge deficit, two unfunded wars, and a ruined economy.\n\nIn our democracy, political criticism is fair game. The problem with Liddick\u2019s diatribes: like Congressional Republicans, he\u2019s quick to criticize \u2013 but offers no new solutions. Case in point: the Republican-controlled House voted 50+ times to repeal ObamaCare, but hasn\u2019t offered a credible plan to replace it.\n\nCome on, Summit Daily. If you\u2019re going to run a weekly local conservative column, how \u2018bout one with more substance than bitter blaming? How \u2018bout a weekly progressive column to provide balance?\n\nJim Callison\n\nSilverthorne", "article_metadata": {"description": "Despite his cheerful photo, Morgan Liddick apparently spends much time angrily searching for villains to blame for all that\u2019s wrong with the world: President Obama, AG Holder, Secretary Kerry,", "og": {"url": "http://www.summitdaily.com/news/13180204-113/liddick-bout-closet-column", "image": {"identifier": "http://www.summitdaily.com/csp/mediapool/sites/SummitDaily/assets/img/facebook-thumbnail-1200.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg"}, "site_name": "The Summit Daily", "description": "Despite his cheerful photo, Morgan Liddick apparently spends much time angrily searching for villains to blame for all that\u2019s wrong with the world: President Obama, AG Holder, Secretary Kerry,", "title": "Callison: Morgan Liddick\u2019s very long list of dislikes | SummitDaily.com"}, "twitter": {"site": "@SummitDailyNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 143571369144148}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 13180204}}, "keywords": "BOUT, CLOSET, COLUMN, CONSERVATIVE, CONSERVATIVES, ENEMIES, GOVERNMENT, LIDDICK, LIST, PRESIDENT", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd762b\"", "article_summary": "Come out of the closet, Mr. Liddick; progressives tolerate different viewpoints more than conservatives.\nIronically, Liddick claims \u201cProgressives crave enemies.\u201d Considering his enemies list, he must be a closet progressive!\nHow \u2018bout a weekly progressive column to provide balance?\nIn describing these perceived villains, Liddick uses terms like \u201cdesperate,\u201d \u201cloonier,\u201d \u201cself-loathing,\u201d \u201chopelessly ignorant,\u201d \u201cbedbugs,\u201d \u201cvampires,\u201d \u201cclown-shoes stupid,\u201d \u201cunhinged,\u201d \u201cunthinking,\u201d \u201coppressive,\u201d \u201cridiculous,\u201d \u201cdithering,\u201d you get the point.\nIf you\u2019re going to run a weekly local conservative column, how \u2018bout one with more substance than bitter blaming?"}
