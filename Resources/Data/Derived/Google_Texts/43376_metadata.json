Minnesota raised its minimum wage to $8.00 per hour on August 1, up from the federal rate of $7.25. Craig Beemer, the owner of the Oasis Cafe, told The Star Tribune that it will cost him an extra $10,000 a year. Instead of raising the costs of menu items, Beemer decided to add the fee to every receipt.\n\n#Stillwater cafe faces heat for adding \"minimum wage fee\" to offset state's minimum wage hike http://t.co/ptgG5qOFiN pic.twitter.com/VVtpQpYSjB \u2014 Kelly Smith (@kellystrib) August 7, 2014\n\nThe extra line time echoes the argument some restaurants made when the Affordable Care Act went into effect. One Los Angeles restaurant began to charg a 3 percent Obamacare surcharge. In 2012, a Denny's franchise owner considered adding a 5 percent Obamacare surcharge. But as we've noted before, costs rise for restaurants all the time \u2014 droughts raise food prices, landlords raise rent prices, etc. \u2014 and companies rarely not their extra expenses on the bill. But Minnesota's new minimum wage \u2014 and the wider, national movement for a living wage \u2014 is something concrete and newsworthy that seems to justify the price hike.\n\nIn both cases, whether it's a fee for providing health care or for paying a living wage, the reaction seems to be mixed. As The Washington Post noted, some commenters praised the restaurant for showing how the new wage affects companies, while others said they didn't mind paying more as much as they minded Beemer's attitude. \u201cI\u2019d gladly absorb a price increase to make sure my waitress/waiter was making a more livable wage, but I won\u2019t patronize a restaurant with your attitude,\u201d Facebook user Chuck Smith-Dewey wrote.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Minnesota restaurant decided to greet the state's recent minimum wage increase by adding a $0.35-cent \"minimum wage fee\" to all bills.", "title": "News, opinion and aggregation on business, politics, entertainment, technology, global and national \u2013 The Wire", "og": {"site_name": "The Wire", "description": "A Minnesota restaurant decided to greet the state's recent minimum wage increase by adding a $0.35-cent \"minimum wage fee\" to all bills.", "title": "A Minnesota Restaurant's 'Minimum Wage Fee' Is the New 'Obamacare Tax'", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.thewire.com/media/img/upload/wire/2014/08/07/AP627551328156/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.thewire.com/politics/2014/08/a-minnesota-restaurants-minimum-wage-fee-is-the-new-obamacare-tax/375741/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A Minnesota restaurant decided to greet the state&#39;s recent minimum wage increase by adding a $0.35-cent \"minimum wage fee\" to all bills.", "title": "A Minnesota Restaurant's 'Minimum Wage Fee' Is the New 'Obamacare Tax'", "image": "http://cdn.thewire.com/media/img/upload/wire/2014/08/07/AP627551328156/lead_large.jpg", "creator": "@aritbenie", "site": "@thewire", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "app_id": 192759427473466}, "keywords": "The Wire, TheWire.com, TheWire.com, news, opinion, aggregation, business, politics, entertainment, technology, global, national", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheAtlanticWire"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccb81\"", "article_summary": "A Minnesota restaurant decided to greet the state's recent minimum wage increase by adding a $0.35-cent \"minimum wage fee\" to all bills.\nMinnesota raised its minimum wage to $8.00 per hour on August 1, up from the federal rate of $7.25.\nBut Minnesota's new minimum wage \u2014 and the wider, national movement for a living wage \u2014 is something concrete and newsworthy that seems to justify the price hike.\n#Stillwater cafe faces heat for adding \"minimum wage fee\" to offset state's minimum wage hike http://t.co/ptgG5qOFiN pic.twitter.com/VVtpQpYSjB \u2014 Kelly Smith (@kellystrib) August 7, 2014The extra line time echoes the argument some restaurants made when the Affordable Care Act went into effect.\nBut as we've noted before, costs rise for restaurants all the time \u2014 droughts raise food prices, landlords raise rent prices, etc."}
