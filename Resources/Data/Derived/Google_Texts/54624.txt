They’re coming at him from all sides. He may be living his last days as senator from Kentucky.

Republicans are buoyant they can capture the Senate this year – but will Mitch McConnell still be there as majority leader?

A surprising survey out of Kentucky this week underscores that the Senate minority leader is truly running the race of his life — and could even be the underdog heading into 2014.

The Bluegrass Poll, conducted by SurveyUSA for several local TV stations and newspapers, showed McConnell trailing Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes by four points, 46 percent to 42 percent. It’s the Secretary of state’s biggest lead yet and outside the poll’s margin of error.

Maybe most troubling for the 29-year incumbent are his persistently low approval ratings — 60 percent disapprove of the job he’s doing in office — which make him as unpopular as Obama in the Bluegrass State. Fifty percent of Kentuckians also view McConnell unfavorably.

Part of McConnell’s problem lies in the fact that he’s fending off attacks from both his left and right flanks. With a primary challenge from businessman Matt Bevin, he’s sustained attacks from conservative groups that have further dinged him along with Democrat hits. …TheHill
