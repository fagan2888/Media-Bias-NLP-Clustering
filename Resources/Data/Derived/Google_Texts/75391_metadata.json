But the Democratic Party filed for a recount, and last month a bipartisan Recount Commission certified its findings in Popp's favor.\n\nWilder said he will take the case to the Indiana Court of Appeals to honor a commitment that he made to Harrod in one of their last conversations. \"His passing doesn't relieve me of my personal obligation and assurance that we would go forward and that's what we're going to do.\"\n\nHarrod-Fieldhouse said the family supports the appeal because it was \"extremely important\" to her father and because of discrepancies related to the election.\n\n\"We would have taken this all the way to (the) Supreme Court, and we still intend to,\" she said. Remaining issues \"need to be ironed out and answered.\"\n\nHarrod, a retired Jeffersonville police officer, had a failed run for sheriff about 20 years ago that stuck with him, Wilder said.\n\nPart of his legacy is being \"the standard-bearer for making sure the county has correct and operational voting equipment and making sure the processes are followed,\" the attorney said.\n\nHarrod, the father of six biological children and four adopted ones, also will be remembered as a proud family man and former investigator who found ways to be kind to others. Harrod-Fieldhouse recalled the time her dad gave one of their air conditioners to a family in need.\n\n\"If we had two, he would take it and give it to somebody else,\" she said. \"That's what kind of man he was.\"\n\nCourier-Journal reporter Darla Carter can be reached at (502) 582-7068 or on Twitter @PrimeDarla.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cjky.it/1B9PtVQ", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Kelly Harrod was at the center of a Clark County Clerk election recount", "og": {"site_name": "The Courier-Journal", "description": "Kelly Harrod was at the center of a Clark County Clerk election recount", "title": "Former Clark Co. candidate Kelly Harrod dies", "url": "http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/local/indiana/2015/01/01/kelly-harrod-dies/21151763/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/courier-journal.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Kelly Harrod was at the center of a Clark County Clerk election recount", "creator": "@courierjournal", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d7ee8afabea291b1f0b810fe9d5f54b34f0a7b68/c=0-49-275-324&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/01/01/WHAS/WHAS/635557042219527765-kelly-harrod.jpg", "title": "Kelly Harrod, man at center of Clark County Clerk election, passes away at age 63", "site": "@courierjournal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600030236", "fb": {"app_id": 128534137209813}, "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Subjects/Heart attack", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Subjects/Heart attack", "title": "Former Clark Co. candidate Kelly Harrod dies", "author": "Darla Carter", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/local/indiana", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/eb17b7a0eb7acd20939d4f361db470453edcc223/c=0-3-275-370/local/-/media/2015/01/01/WHAS/WHAS/635557042219527765-kelly-harrod.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a1330886a1351d4c5c8fe353cb83fb2f851093d1/c=0-49-275-324/local/-/media/2015/01/01/WHAS/WHAS/635557042219527765-kelly-harrod.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/421d2675dceac75b7dba5f8f3112ad33c263a686/c=0-83-275-290/local/-/media/2015/01/01/WHAS/WHAS/635557042219527765-kelly-harrod.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b22991bf1b173ed9b414fb7ee4ae71cc1c453f11/c=0-109-275-264&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/01/01/WHAS/WHAS/635557042219527765-kelly-harrod.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-01-01T19:28:55.597000-05:00", "shorthed": "Kelly Harrod passes away at 63", "articleid": 21151763, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d249acd16eb3e7763823ce358fad8e6e6b2c57b5/c=0-109-275-264/local/-/media/2015/01/01/WHAS/WHAS/635557042219527765-kelly-harrod.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f293c189b018a8c7bba4eaa5822f2c3cc3047e22/c=33-0-242-373/local/-/media/2015/01/01/WHAS/WHAS/635557042219527765-kelly-harrod.jpg"}}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Kelly Harrod, Clark County circuit court clerk, Susan Popp, Jeffersonville police, Clark County sheriff's office, recount"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4481\"", "article_summary": "Kelly Harrod, 63, suffered a heart attack shortly before Christmas and never fully recovered, said his attorney Larry Wilder.\nKelly Harrod (Photo: Courtesy photo)A man who'd been involved in a battle to become circuit court clerk in Clark County (Ind.)\nHarrod died after heart attack; had wanted to be circuit court clerk in Clark County (Ind.)\n\"He had a massive heart attack,\" she said.\nHarrod, a Republican and Vietnam veteran, had been involved in an election controversy in the county."}
