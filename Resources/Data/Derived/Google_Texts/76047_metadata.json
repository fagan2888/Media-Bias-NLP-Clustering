Free contraceptives for Sandra Fluke. Free mammograms and checkups for you and me. Free (or subsidized) insurance for some 30 million uninsured. And, mirabile dictu, not costing the government a dime.\n\nIn fact, Obamacare is a full-scale federal takeover. The keep-your-plan-if-you-like-your-plan ruse was a way of saying to the millions of Americans who had insurance and liked what they had: Don\u2019t worry. You\u2019ll be left unmolested. For you, everything goes on as before.\n\nThat was a fraud from the very beginning. The law was designed to throw people off their private plans and into government-run exchanges where they would be made to overpay \u2014 forced to purchase government-mandated services they don\u2019t need \u2014 as a way to subsidize others. (That\u2019s how you get to the ostensible free lunch.)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until the first cancellation notices went out in late 2013 that the deception began to be understood. And felt. Six million Americans with private insurance have just lost it. And that\u2019s just the beginning. By the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 own estimates, about 75 million Americans would have plans that their employers would have the right to cancel. And millions of middle-class workers who will migrate to the exchanges and don\u2019t qualify for government subsidies will see their premiums, deductibles and co-pays go up.\n\n1 of 25 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 The Right\u2019s 25 most influential, from Townhall.com View Photos The conservative Web site\u2019s latest listing of the most prominent voices on the right, with a few names you may not know.

The dislocation extends to losing one\u2019s doctor and drug coverage, as insurance companies narrow availability to compensate for the huge costs imposed on them by the extended coverage and \u201cfree\u201d services the new law mandates.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just individuals seeing their medical care turned upside down. The insurance providers, the backbone of the system, are being utterly transformed. They are rapidly becoming mere extensions of the federal government.\n\nLook what happened just last week. Health and Human Services unilaterally and without warning changed coverage deadlines and guidelines. It asked insurers to start covering people on Jan. 1 even if they signed up as late as the day before and even if they hadn\u2019t paid their premiums. And is \u201cstrongly encouraging\u201d them to pay during the transition for doctor visits and medicines not covered in their current plans (if covered in the patient\u2019s previous \u2014 canceled \u2014 plan).\n\nOn what authority does a Cabinet secretary tell private companies to pay for services not in their plans and cover people not on their rolls? Where in Obamacare\u2019s 2,500 pages are such high-handed dictates authorized? Does anyone even ask? The bill itself is simply taken as a kind of blanket warrant for HHS to run, regulate and control the whole insurance system.\n\nRemember the uproar over forcing religious institutions to provide contraception coverage? The president\u2019s \u201cfix\u201d was a new regulation ordering insurers to provide these services for free. Apart from the fact that this transparent ruse does nothing to resolve the underlying issue of conscience \u2014 God sees \u2014 by what right does the government order private companies to provide free services for anyone?\n\nThree years ago I predicted that Obamacare would turn insurers into the lapdog equivalent of utility companies. I undershot. They are being treated as wholly owned subsidiaries. Take the phrase \u201cstrongly encouraging.\u201d Sweet persuasion? In reality, these are offers insurers can\u2019t refuse. Disappoint your federal master and he has the power to kick you off the federal exchanges, where the health insurance business of the future is supposed to be conducted.\n\nMoreover, if adverse selection drives insurers into a financial death spiral \u2014 too few healthy young people to offset more costly, sicker, older folks \u2014 their only recourse will be a government bailout. Do they really want to get on the wrong side of the White House, their only lifeline when facing insolvency?\n\n1 of 8 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 What Obama didn\u2019t know View Photos The many controversies that the White House says the president was kept in the dark about.

Thousands who had bought insurance have been receiving cancellations notices from insurers. The president said he wasn\u2019t aware his promise before the rollout would result in cancellations, and Obama had repeatedly stated that, although new health-care insurance would be available through the Affordable Care Act, those willing to stay on their plan would be able to do so.In fact, that wasn\u2019t the case.

They deserve what they get. They collaborated with the White House in concocting this scheme and are now being swallowed by it. But I do care about the citizenry and its access to a functioning, flourishing, choice-driven medical system.\n\nObamacare posed as a free-market alternative to a British-style single-payer system. Then, during congressional debate, the White House ostentatiously rejected the so-called \u201cpublic option.\u201d But that\u2019s irrelevant. The whole damn thing is the public option. The federal government now runs the insurance market, dictating deadlines, procedures, rates, risk assessments and coverage requirements. It\u2019s gotten so cocky it\u2019s now telling insurers to cover the claims that, by law, they are not required to.\n\nWelcome 2014, our first taste of nationalized health care.\n\nRead more from Charles Krauthammer\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The nation finally wakes up to how radical Obamacare is.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Charles-Krauthammer/95978776589", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The nation finally wakes up to how radical Obamacare is.", "title": "Charles Krauthammer: Story of the year", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/charles-krauthammer-story-of-the-year/2013/12/19/1d862c98-68f9-11e3-ae56-22de072140a2_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2013/12/19/Editorial-Opinion/Images/Health_Overhaul_Disparities-08b91-1709.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@krauthammer"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/charles-krauthammer-story-of-the-year/2013/12/19/1d862c98-68f9-11e3-ae56-22de072140a2_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "charles krauthammer, charles krauthammer column, charles krauthammer washington post, obamacare, affordable care act, obama health insurance, public option, obama health care, obama lie of the year, you can keep you plan, you can keep your health plan, politifact obama, politifact obama health care,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Charles-Krauthammer/95978776589"}, "news_keywords": "charles krauthammer, charles krauthammer column, charles krauthammer washington post, obamacare, affordable care act, obama health insurance, public option, obama health care, obama lie of the year, you can keep you plan, you can keep your health plan, politifact obama, politifact obama health care,", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "eomportal-uuid": "1d862c98-68f9-11e3-ae56-22de072140a2"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2806\"", "article_summary": "Do they really want to get on the wrong side of the White House, their only lifeline when facing insolvency?\nThen, during congressional debate, the White House ostentatiously rejected the so-called \u201cpublic option.\u201d But that\u2019s irrelevant.\nCaption The many controversies that the White House says the president was kept in the dark about.\nThey collaborated with the White House in concocting this scheme and are now being swallowed by it.\nRead more from Charles Krauthammer\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook."}
