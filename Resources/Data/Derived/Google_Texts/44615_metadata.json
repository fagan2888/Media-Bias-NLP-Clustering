Walking across the beach could produce anything from cigarette butts, to discarded Nathan\u2019s hot dog boxes, to dirty diapers under your bare feet.\n\nNow, it appears that a good chunk of other U.S. beaches are equally dirty \u2014 and dangerously so. A new report out of the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) found that 10 percent of U.S. beaches are filled with sewage and other contaminants, at levels way beyond the EPA\u2019s swimmers\u2019 safety threshold. In particular, the report singled out certain areas as the worst offenders \u2014 these included New England, the Gulf Coast, the Great Lakes region, and some areas of the West Coast. A good number of these beaches suffered from urban runoff and pollution.\n\nMeanwhile, Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia all scored highest when it came to \u201csuperstar\u201d beaches \u2014 these states had the most consistently clean beaches over the course of five years, with bacteria levels remaining low throughout this time.\n\nPolluted water at beaches could cause a number of diseases, ranging from skin rashes and pinkeye to stomach flu, dysentery, and hepatitis. According to the EPA, up to 3.5 million people get sick from contact with raw sewage in swimming water every year. \u201cSewage and contaminated runoff in the water should never ruin a family beach trip,\u201d Jon Devine, a senior attorney at NRDC, said in a statement. \u201cBut no matter where you live, urban slobber and other pollution can seriously compromise the water quality at your favorite beach and make your family sick.\u201d\n\nThe following beaches have shown \u201cconsistent contamination problems,\u201d and are listed on a \u201crepeat offender\u201d list by the NRDC. They have failed to meet public standards for water quality over 25 percent of the time since 2009, so be sure to avoid these:", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "dirty beaches, pollution, water", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A good chunk of beaches in the U.S. have failed to meet water safety standards and are contaminated with sewage and urban pollution.", "title": "10% Of US Beaches Are Dangerously Polluted, And These Are The Worst Offenders", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/10-us-beaches-fail-water-safety-test-due-heavy-pollution-and-raw-sewage-290242", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/26/pollution.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A good chunk of beaches in the U.S. have failed to meet water safety standards and are contaminated with sewage and urban pollution.", "title": "10% Of US Beaches Are Dangerously Polluted, And These Are The Worst Offenders", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/10-us-beaches-fail-water-safety-test-due-heavy-pollution-and-raw-sewage-290242", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/26/pollution.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/26/pollution.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-06-26T17:47:21-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-26T17:54:56-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A good chunk of beaches in the U.S. have failed to meet water safety standards and are contaminated with sewage and urban pollution."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb676\"", "article_summary": "According to the EPA, up to 3.5 million people get sick from contact with raw sewage in swimming water every year.\nA good number of these beaches suffered from urban runoff and pollution.\nPolluted water at beaches could cause a number of diseases, ranging from skin rashes and pinkeye to stomach flu, dysentery, and hepatitis.\nThe last time I was at Coney Island beach in Brooklyn, about a few weeks ago, the water was a murky brown and smelled like sewage.\n\u201cSewage and contaminated runoff in the water should never ruin a family beach trip,\u201d Jon Devine, a senior attorney at NRDC, said in a statement."}
