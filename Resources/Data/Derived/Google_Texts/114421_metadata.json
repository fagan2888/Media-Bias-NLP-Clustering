At Mission, the full report reveals an insect got into the operating room on at least two occasions, and a Register review of inspection reports for five major Orange County hospitals found issues such as lack of hand-hygiene compliance, rusty procedure tables and improper sterilization of surgical tools.\n\nHowever, a hospital could receive citations for multiple violations but still appear as good as or better than the national average based solely on public infection rates, the newspaper reported. Full inspection reports are only available through a Public Records Act request, which are released once the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services approve the provider in question's strategy for fixing the problem.\n\nWith increased transparency, patients could know what to look for and in some cases help their providers, according to Douglas Merrill, M.D., chief medical officer at UCI Medical Center, insisting their doctor take steps such as hand-hygiene compliance where necessary.\n\n\"Doctors are human beings; we will make mistakes,\" he told the Register. \"We shouldn't be dependent on the patient, but they do have a unique interest in us doing our jobs.\"\n\nProviders' lack of transparency often keeps victims of medical malpractice out of the loop, such as the case of a Cleveland man who was not told medical gauze was left in his stomach after a dental procedure despite it appearing on his medical records, FierceHealthcare previously reported.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nHow hospitals' 'culture of secrecy' keeps error victims out of the loop\n\nHospital medical errors now third-leading cause of death in the U.S.\n\nCalifornia hospital shuts down ORs after patient infections\n\nFinancial responsibility for hospital medical errors: No easy answers\n\nMass. hospitals rethink medical error response\n\nPhysician \"culture of perfection\" keeps medical errors high\n\nUpdated medical errors report shows progress\n\nCA senator demands hospitals reduce rampant medical errors\n\nHospital medical errors now the third leading cause of death in the U.S.\n\n5 ways the ACA may affect malpractice risk", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hospital medical errors are the third-leading cause of death in the United States, but an\u00a0environment of secrecy\u00a0often keeps the public from learning the details,\u00a0according\u00a0to an article published by the\u00a0Orange County Register.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Hospital medical errors are the third-leading cause of death in the United States, but an\u00a0environment of secrecy\u00a0often keeps the public from learning the details,\u00a0according\u00a0to an article published by the\u00a0Orange County Register.", "title": "Hospital error rates may hide mistakes", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/hospital-error-rates-may-hide-mistakes/2015-12-02", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Care Delivery,Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS),Hand Hygiene,Infection Control,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,medical errors,Mission Hospital,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes,patient safety,transparency", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd901f\"", "article_summary": "hospitals rethink medical error responsePhysician \"culture of perfection\" keeps medical errors highUpdated medical errors report shows progressCA senator demands hospitals reduce rampant medical errorsHospital medical errors now the third leading cause of death in the U.S.5 ways the ACA may affect malpractice risk\nTo learn more:- read the articleRelated Articles:How hospitals' 'culture of secrecy' keeps error victims out of the loopHospital medical errors now third-leading cause of death in the U.S.California hospital shuts down ORs after patient infectionsFinancial responsibility for hospital medical errors: No easy answersMass.\nHospitals are required by law to report their infection rates, but figures alone don't tell the full story in many cases.\nHowever, a hospital could receive citations for multiple violations but still appear as good as or better than the national average based solely on public infection rates, the newspaper reported.\nHospital medical errors are the third-leading cause of death in the United States, but an environment of secrecy often keeps the public from learning the details, according to an article published by the Orange County Register."}
