These little snippets are intended for readers to explore the technology being made right here. One company at a time, of course.\n\nJAB Broadband\n\nSomeone has to get Internet to those crazy people who willingly choose to live in a land with no broadband. JAB Broadband, a.k.a. Skybeam, Prairie iNet and others , targets remote areas with fixed wireless, a technology where fast Internet is beamed from central towers to homes up to 15 miles away. JAB, which are the initials of co-founder Jeff Kohler\u2019s three children (awww), typically offers 5 to 20 mbps starting at $40 a month. Fastest speed? 1 Gbps \u2014 yes, gigabit \u2014 for businesses willing to pay $2,500 a month. JAB likes to call itself the biggest company you\u2019ve never heard of. In 10 years, it\u2019s acquired 107 companies, albeit with some growing pains. DSLReports has mixed reviews mostly about customer service. Consider JAB a work in progress as a company offering Internet to those with very few options.
