It claimed this was a legal act it is prepared to repeat as necessary. Given the Fifth Amendment, how exactly was this justified? Thanks to a much contested, recently released but significantly redacted \u2014 about one-third of the text is missing \u2014 Justice Department white paper providing the basis for that extrajudicial killing, we finally know: the president in Post-Constitutional America is now officially judge, jury, and executioner.\n\nDue Process in Constitutional America\n\nLooking back on the violations of justice that characterized British rule in pre-Constitutional America, it is easy to see the Founders\u2019 intent in creating the Fifth Amendment. A government\u2019s ability to inflict harm on its people, whether by taking their lives, imprisoning them, or confiscating their property, was to be checked by due process.\n\nDue process is the only requirement of government that is stated twice in the Constitution, signaling its importance. The Fifth Amendment imposed the due process requirement on the federal government, while the Fourteenth Amendment did the same for the states. Both offer a crucial promise to the people that fair procedures will remain available to challenge government actions. The broader concept of due process goes all the way back to the thirteenth-century Magna Carta.\n\nDue process, as refined over the years by the Supreme Court, came to take two forms in Constitutional America. The first was procedural due process: people threatened by government actions that might potentially take away life, liberty, or possessions would have the right to defend themselves from a power that sought, whether for good reasons or bad, to deprive them of something important. American citizens were guaranteed their proverbial \u201cday in court.\u201d\n\nThe second type, substantive due process, was codified in 1938 to protect those rights so fundamental that they are implicit in liberty itself, even when not spelled out explicitly in the Constitution. Had the concept been in place at the time, a ready example would have been slavery. Though not specifically prohibited by the Constitution, it was on its face an affront to democracy. No court process could possibly have made slavery fair. The same held, for instance, for the \u201cright\u201d to an education, to have children, and so forth. Substantive due process is often invoked by supporters of same-sex unions, who assert that there is a fundamental right to marry. The meaning is crystal clear: there is an inherent, moral sense of \u201cdue process\u201d applicable to government actions against any citizen and it cannot be done away with legally. Any law that attempts to interfere with such rights is inherently unconstitutional.\n\nAl-Awlaki\u2019s Death\n\nOn September 30, 2011, on the order of the president, a U.S. drone fired a missile in Yemen and killed Anwar al-Awlaki. A Northern Virginia Islamic cleric, in the aftermath of 9/11 he had been invited to lunch at the Pentagon as part of a program to create ties to Muslim moderates. After he moved to Yemen a few years later, the U.S. accused him of working with al-Qaeda as a propagandist who may have played an online role in persuading others to join the cause. (He was allegedly linked to the \u201cUnderwear Bomber\u201d and the Fort Hood shooter.) However, no one has ever accused him of pulling a trigger or setting off a bomb, deeds that might, in court, rise to the level of a capital crime. Al-Awlaki held a set of beliefs and talked about them. For that he was executed without trial.\n\nIn March 2012, Attorney General Eric Holder made quite a remarkable statement about the al-Awlaki killing. He claimed \u201cthat a careful and thorough executive branch review of the facts in a case amounts to \u2018due process\u2019 and that the Constitution\u2019s Fifth Amendment protection against depriving a citizen of his or her life without due process of law does not mandate a \u2018judicial process.\u2019\u201d In other words, according to the top legal authority in the nation, a White House review was due process enough when it came to an American citizen with al-Qaeda sympathies. In this, though it was unknown at the time, Holder was essentially quoting a secret white paper on that killing produced by the Office of Legal Counsel, located in the department he headed.\n\nIn June 2014, after a long court battle to shield the underlying legal basis for the killing, the Obama administration finally released a redacted version of that classified 2010 white paper. In the end, it did so only because without its release key senators were reluctant to confirm the memo\u2019s author, David Barron, who had been nominated by President Obama to serve on the First Circuit Court of Appeals. (Once it was made public, Barron was indeedconfirmed.)\n\nThe importance of the white paper to understanding Post-Constitutional America cannot be understated. Despite all the unconstitutional actions taken by the government since 9/11 \u2014 including striking violations of the Fourth Amendment \u2014 this paper is to date the only glimpse we have of the kind of thinking that has gone into Washington\u2019s violations of the Bill of Rights.\n\nHere\u2019s the terrifying part: ostensibly the result of some of the best legal thinking available to the White House on a issue that couldn\u2019t be more basic to the American system, it wouldn\u2019t get a first-year law student a C-. The arguments are almost bizarrely puerile in a document that is a visibly shaky attempt to provide cover for a pre-determined premise. No wonder the administration fought its release for so long. Its officials were, undoubtedly, ashamed of it. Let\u2019s drill down.\n\nDeath by Pen\n\nFor the killing of an American citizen to be legal, the document claims, you need one essential thing: \u201can informed, high-level official of the U.S. government [who] has determined that the targeted individual poses an imminent threat of violent attack against the United States.\u201d In addition, capture must be found to be unfeasible and the act of killing must follow the existing laws of war, which means drones are okay but poison gas is a no-no.\n\nThe rest of the justification in the white paper flows from that premise in a perverse chain of ankle-bone-connected-to-the-leg-bone logic: the president has the obligation to protect America; al-Qaeda is a threat; Congress authorized war against it; and being in al-Qaeda is more relevant than citizenship (or as the document crudely puts it, \u201ccitizenship does not immunize the target\u201d). International borders and the sovereignty of other nations are not issues if the U.S. determines the host nation is \u201cunwilling or unable to suppress the threat posed by the individual targeted.\u201d Basically, it\u2019s all an extension of the idea of self-defense, with more than a dash of convenience shaken in.\n\nWhen the white paper addresses the Fifth Amendment\u2019s right to due process, and to a lesser extent, the Fourth Amendment\u2019s right against unwarranted seizure (that is, the taking of a life), it dismisses them via the \u201cbalancing test.\u201d Not exactly bedrock constitutional material, it works this way: in situations where the government\u2019s interest overshadows an individual\u2019s interest, and the individual\u2019s interest isn\u2019t that big a deal to begin with, and a mistake by the government can later be undone, the full due process clause of the Fifth Amendment need not come into play.\n\nThe three-point balancing test cited by the white paper as conclusive enough to justify the extrajudicial killing of an American comes from a 1976 Supreme Court case, Mathews v. Eldridge. There, the court held that an individual denied Social Security benefits had a right to some form of due process, but not necessarily full-blown hearings. In Anwar al-Awlaki\u2019s case, this translates into some truly dubious logic: the government\u2019s interest in protecting Americans overshadows one citizen\u2019s interest in staying alive. Somehow, the desire to stay alive doesn\u2019t count for much because al-Awlaki belonged to al-Qaeda and was in the backlands of Yemen, which meant that he was not conveniently available by capture for a trial date. Admittedly, there\u2019s no undoing death in a drone killing, but so what.", "article_metadata": {"description": "What happens when the executive branch can play judge, jury and executioner in the war on terror?", "title": "How to survive in post-constitutional America", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "What happens when the executive branch can play judge, jury and executioner in the war on terror?", "title": "How to survive in post-constitutional America", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/07/27/how_to_survive_in_post_constitutional_america_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/02/shutterstock_103142567-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "What happens when the executive branch can play judge, jury and executioner in the war on terror?", "title": "How to survive in post-constitutional America", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/02/shutterstock_103142567-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Peter Van Buren", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Anwar al-Awlaki, constitution, Drone strikes, Drone War, TomDispatch.com, War on Terror", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe19a4\"", "article_summary": "The importance of the white paper to understanding Post-Constitutional America cannot be understated.\nThe Fifth Amendment imposed the due process requirement on the federal government, while the Fourteenth Amendment did the same for the states.\nDue Process in Constitutional AmericaLooking back on the violations of justice that characterized British rule in pre-Constitutional America, it is easy to see the Founders\u2019 intent in creating the Fifth Amendment.\nDue process, as refined over the years by the Supreme Court, came to take two forms in Constitutional America.\nGiven the Fifth Amendment, how exactly was this justified?"}
