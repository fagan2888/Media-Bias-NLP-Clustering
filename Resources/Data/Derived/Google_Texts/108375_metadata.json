White, reconstituted the denomination under the doctrine that Jesus had actually relocated to a heavenly sanctuary where he would begin judgment of the world. She was seen as a prophet.\n\nUnlike members of other Christian denominations, Adventists honor the Sabbath on Saturdays instead of Sundays. They tend to be vegetarians, and they continue to wait patiently for the Second Coming and the end of the world.\n\nThe Seventh-day Adventist Church counts more than 18 million members globally and 1.2 million in North America, but some skeptics see it as a sect out of touch with mainstream Christianity. While the church avoids involvement in politics, Mr. Carson\u2019s emergence as a prominent political figure has presented an opportunity for it to gain credibility.\n\n\u201cWe do not endorse any candidates, and we do not use our church for political reasons,\u201d Alex Bryant, the secretary of the North American division of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, said of Mr. Carson\u2019s candidacy. \u201cBut we do look at it as an opportunity to tell the world, tell this country about Seventh-day Adventism, our beliefs and our desire to lift up Jesus Christ.\u201d\n\nA twice-baptized Adventist, Mr. Carson has become one of the church\u2019s biggest stars. In his autobiography, \u201cGifted Hands,\u201d he recounts his mother\u2019s conversion, which began in the ward of a mental hospital.\n\nIt was not until he was 14 that Mr. Carson became truly captured by his faith. Known for having a temper back then, the young Mr. Carson let a petty dispute turn into a tantrum that ended with his knifing a friend. The episode could have been deadly had it not been for a belt buckle that blocked his blade. From that time on, Mr. Carson prayed away his anger.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cMy temper will never control me again,\u201d Mr. Carson wrote in his book. \u201cNever again. I\u2019m free.\u201d\n\nMr. Carson, who declined to be interviewed for this article, attends church regularly and taught Bible school at his Seventh-day Adventist church in Maryland. Now that he is a politician, he speaks often about the role that God has played in his life, but he has tended to vary discussion of his religious beliefs depending on the venue.\n\nDuring a 1999 interview with the Religion News Service, Mr. Carson said he was happy to attend other kinds of churches. \u201cI spend just as much time in non-Seventh-day Adventist churches because I\u2019m not convinced that the denomination is the most important thing,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s the relationship with God that\u2019s most important.\u201d\n\nMore recently, however, Mr. Carson made clear that he would always defend his Adventist beliefs against skeptics.\n\nFirst Draft Newsletter Subscribe for updates on the 2016 presidential race, the White House and Congress, delivered to your inbox Monday - Friday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud of the fact that I believe what God has said, and I\u2019ve said many times that I\u2019ll defend it before anyone,\u201d Mr. Carson told the Adventist Report in 2013. \u201cIf they want to criticize the fact that I believe in a literal six-day creation, let\u2019s have at it, because I will poke all kinds of holes in what they believe.\u201d\n\nFor theological reasons, Adventism has faced tensions with the Roman Catholic and Baptist Churches over the years. Last spring, Mr. Carson was invited to speak at a Southern Baptist Pastors\u2019 Conference in Ohio, but he faced opposition because of his beliefs and eventually backed out.\n\n\u201cDr. Carson is a Seventh-day Adventist,\u201d a group of pastors from the Baptist organization B21 wrote in protest of his visit. \u201cTheir official theology denies the doctrine of hell in favor of annihilation,\u201d they wrote, \u201cand believes that those who worship on Sunday will bear the \u2018mark of the beast.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe church has also had a strongly anti-Catholic strain, and when Mr. Carson decided to attend Pope Francis\u2019 visit to Congress last month, Adventist message boards lit up with questions about his presence with the pontiff. Some questioned his referring to the pope as the \u201cHoly Leader\u201d and wondered, \u201cHow do such words come from the mouth of a Seventh-day Adventist?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOn the other hand, some Adventists have been disappointed in a perceived lack of tolerance regarding Islam from Mr. Carson, who said recently that he did not think a Muslim should be able to be president. His fierce opposition to the Affordable Care Act, which he has compared to slavery, has also rankled some in the community who say the law is in keeping with the religion\u2019s focus on promoting health.\n\n\u201cIt was certainly disappointing for me,\u201d Sam Geli, a retired Adventist chaplain who considers himself an independent, said of Mr. Carson\u2019s remarks about Muslims. \u201cIt was very sad.\u201d\n\nBut will Mr. Carson\u2019s religion affect his prospects with conservative evangelicals in places such as Iowa? So far it has not been a problem.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of evangelicals would say they would rather have a practicing Adventist than a nominal Presbyterian who doesn\u2019t seem to have basic theological understanding about Christianity,\u201d said Thomas Kidd, a professor of history and religion at Baylor University in Texas. \u201cEven if he\u2019s not an evangelical like us, he\u2019s sort of a friendly fellow traveler in a way that Trump is not.\u201d\n\nBob Vander Plaats, the president and chief executive of the Family Leader, a social conservative group in Iowa, said his members had not yet expressed concern about Mr. Carson\u2019s religion. He cited the support that Mr. Romney received from evangelicals in 2012, saying he did not think the fact that Mr. Carson is a Seventh-day Adventist would be an issue unless theology became central to the political debate.\n\n\u201cI think Trump threw out the fleece to let people check it out,\u201d Mr. Vander Plaats said of why he thought Mr. Carson\u2019s religion suddenly became an issue. \u201cPeople of faith will be more interested in the fruit of leadership, policy and does it align with honoring God or dishonoring God.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime":
