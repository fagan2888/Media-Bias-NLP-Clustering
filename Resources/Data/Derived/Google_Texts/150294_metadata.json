Her challenges in repeating that feat are three-fold, analysts say.\n\nThe unusually high turnout of African-American voters in the 2008 presidential election, buoyed by then-candidate Barack Obama at the top of the ticket, and key to Landrieu for the 90-plus percent of black voters who back her, is unlikely to be replicated in 2014.\n\nHurricane Katrina, which demonstrated Landrieu's ability to steer large recovery funds to her state, is for many a receding memory.\n\nAmong potential swing voters, she is weighed down by her association-by-party with President Obama, who is deeply unpopular among independent and Republican whites in the state, said Kurt Corbello, associate professor of political science at Southeastern Louisiana University and a longtime student of the state's politics.\n\nFOSSIL FUELS\n\nLandrieu confronts these obstacles with a message built around her clout and a robust fundraising apparatus that in the current cycle has taken in over $14 million, more than $5 million in excess of her main Republican challenger, U.S. Representative Bill Cassidy.\n\nTo woo moderates, the chairwoman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee has staked out positions - from supporting the Keystone XL oil pipeline to favoring continued tax breaks for oil drilling - that have also won over some in the state's fossil fuel industry.\n\nBut the 2008 \"Katrina bump\" she enjoyed among whites in greater New Orleans will be difficult to replicate, said John Couvillon, a Louisiana pollster who works mostly for Republican candidates.\n\nMoreover, he added, blacks made up an estimated 30 percent of Louisiana's electorate that year, a figure likely to be closer to 25-27 percent in 2014.\n\n\"In the absence of higher black turnout and Katrina, she would have gotten 49 percent,\" he said, referring to 2008. \"This occurred before she had to carry water for an unpopular Democratic president.\"\n\nIndeed, in a state Mitt Romney won by more than 17 percent in 2012, with overwhelming support from whites, Cassidy and his backers have persistently linked Landrieu to Obama and, in particular, to her support of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\"We\u2019re merely pointing out that her record is in lock step with the president's agenda,\" said Cassidy campaign spokesman John Cummins, noting the steady, if slim, lead his candidate has enjoyed in polls.\n\nIf, as expected, no candidate secures a majority in the Nov. 4 primary, the top-two finishers, likely Landrieu and Cassidy, will compete in a runoff on Dec. 6.\n\nBoth sides have set aside funds for the runoff, which, if Republicans in November pick up five of the six seats they need to gain Senate control, would likely prove decisive, said Jennifer Duffy, senior editor at the Cook Political Report.\n\n\"Whatever this race looks like on Nov. 3, it's going to look a lot different on Nov. 5. It\u2019s like hitting the reset button,\" she said.\n\nBut the hurdles in Landrieu's path appear unlikely to shrink after the primary, Couvillon said.\"I never count her out because she's a fighter,\" he said. \"But the winds are blowing against her more strongly than in the 2002 and 2008 elections.\"\n\n(Additional reporting by Alistair Bell in Washington; Editing by Gunna Dickson)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Jonathan Kaminsky", "Author": "Jonathan Kaminsky", "DCSext.PageNumber": 1, "twitter": {"description": "As U.S. Senator Mary Landrieu addressed students at a New Orleans university destroyed by Hurricane Katrina nine years ago telling of her struggles to fund its restoration, she could as easily have been describing her fight this year to get re-elected.", "title": "U.S. Senator Landrieu faces headwinds in Louisiana re-election bid", "image": "http://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20141010&t=2&i=982393330&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=LYNXNPEA990HX", "creator": "@Reuters", "site": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "DCSext.rChannel": "Article -
