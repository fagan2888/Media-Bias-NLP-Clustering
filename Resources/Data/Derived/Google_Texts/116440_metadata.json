It is modeled after the Healthy Montana Kids Program, which provides services to low income children in the state.\n\nBullock\u2019s plan would fully utilize approximately $100 million of federal funding to help subsidize coverage through 2020. It would provide coverage for families of three sustained on less than $11 per hour wages and individuals who earn less than $7.25 per hour. The program would remain funded 90 percent by the federal government. Another Republican-proposed plan would not utilize those dollars or expand coverage to as many people, according to Bullock.\n\n\u201cI think there are some plans that are more trying to say we\u2019re doing something than actually doing it,\u201d Bullock said. \u201cThere are some folks who will say that these 70,000 folks don\u2019t need insurance, but they show up at your emergency room and the vast majority of them are working.\u201d\n\nIn Lake County, more than 2,000 people are estimated to live without insurance, putting a burden on local hospitals.\n\nSt. Luke CEO Steve Todd said uncompensated charity care cost the hospital $3.5 million in 2013 and $3.7 million in 2014. Those costs end up being paid for by raising the price of services. When the Affordable Care Act set in during 2014, Todd said the hospital held insurance enrollment fairs, but at the end of the day many people were turned away because they were not eligible for coverage.\n\n\u201cTo get to that point and have to go \u2018There\u2019s really nothing we can do for you here,\u2019 was really disappointing,\u201d Todd said.\n\nConfederated Salish and Kootenai Director of Tribal Health and Human Services Anna Whiting Sorrell said that Native Americans make up 20,000 of the uninsured in the state. She pointed out that native men and women on average die two decades before their Caucasian counterparts, though they are supposed to be eligible for care through Indian Health Services.\n\nSorrell said the Tribes recently received a 66-page document inventorying basic diagnostic procedures that were denied by IHS in a six-month time frame. Most people denied care would be covered by Medicaid expansion.\n\nSorrell was not enthusiastic about the Republican-proposed alternative to Bullock\u2019s plan.\n\n\u201cOur tribal council members are testifying today before a House committee that has a bill to expand Medicaid that really doesn\u2019t expand Medicaid,\u201d Sorrell said. \u201cWhat it does is gets care for a few people.\u201d\n\nSalomon said the parties are trying to put aside partisan differences and work together.\n\n\u201cWe missed our chance last time,\u201d Salomon said. \u201cSo what are we going to do about it? Are we going to play politics? We have a lot of people who are saying \u2018no,\u2019 and that we need to take advantage of this opportunity. There are some issues, no bones about it. There are some issues we are trying to work through, but at the end of the day, how do we keep our hospitals going?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A bipartisan coalition is much more likely to pass some form of Medicaid expansion to provide health coverage for approximately 70,000 uninsured Montanans...", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1d19\"", "article_summary": "Megan Strickland Megan Strickland Megan Strickland Megan Strickland Megan Strickland Megan Strickland Megan Strickland Megan Strickland Megan Strickland Megan Strickland Megan Strickland Megan Strickland \u2039 \u203aA bipartisan coalition is much more likely to pass some form of Medicaid expansion to provide health coverage for approximately 70,000 uninsured Montanans in the ongoing legislative session than last session, Governor Steve Bullock said after a tour of St. Luke Community Hospital on Feb. 18.\nBullock touts Medicaid plan in RonanMegan Strickland Governor Steve Bullock explained his reasoning for expanding Medicaid in a Ronan presentation.\nMegan Strickland Governor Steve Bullock tours St. Luke Hospital in Ronan Feb. 11 with CEO Steve Todd.\n\u201cI think we are proposing a great plan,\u201d Bullock said.\nMegan Strickland Representative Dan Salomon, right, discusses healthcare issues with Steve Todd."}
