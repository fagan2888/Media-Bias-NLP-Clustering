Forty-one percent of those have been implemented, which has saved taxpayers approximately $56 billion; another $69 billion could be saved in the next decade.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service and the Defense and Health and Human Services departments are the biggest offenders identified in the new study.\n\nFor instance, the Pentagon could save \u201ctens of millions\u201d annually if the agency would centralize and enforce the existing acquisition policies in terms of purchasing \u201ccommercial satellite communications (SATCOM) services.\u201d\n\nRelated: Why Social Security\u2019s Crackdown on Disability Fraud Is Coming Up Short\n\nAs for the IRS, the agency could potentially collect billions in tax underpayments and help close the annual $385 billion \u201ctax gap\u201d if it better coordinated its nine public referral programs, efforts that allow whistleblowers to report scofflaws. The IRS currently doesn\u2019t have any way for those nine disparate programs to communicate with one another and to make matters worse, the efforts \u201cinvolve largely manual processes.\u201d\n\n\u201cUntil IRS takes these actions, it may be missing opportunities to assist the public, collect billions in uncollected taxes owed, and leverage resources to streamline processes, which could help it to better coordinate and identify possible efficiencies, as well as better manage fragmentation and overlap,\u201d according to GAO.\n\nMeanwhile, there is also redundant federal spending on health insurance coverage for individuals transitioning between Medicaid and federally subsidized state exchanges set up via Obamacare.\n\nRelated: Democratic Senators Demand Investigation of $3 Billion in Wasted Bio-Drugs\n\nTestifying about the report on Wednesday, U.S. Comptroller General Gene Dodaro told House lawmakers that the government could save more money through a host of actions, such as: eliminating overpayments by the Social Security Administration; granting federal agencies use of excess Pentagon facilities and ammunition \u201cso we don\u2019t have to buy it twice;\u201d and raising fees, some of which have not been increased in 20 years, to deal with things like deferred maintenance at national parks.\n\nMembers of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hailed the report and the work of the GAO, but nonetheless used the hearing to gripe about the glacial pace of implementing cost-saving measures.\n\n\u201cWhy do we need to come back year after year to discuss the same actions?\u201d asked chair Jason Chaffetz (R-UT). \u201cTaking action at just three agencies -- the Department of Defense, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Internal Revenue Service -- if we did just those three, we would save literally billions upon billions of dollars.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Despite efforts by Congress and the Obama administration, the federal government is still hemorrhaging tens of billions dollars every year on duplicative programs.", "title": "Billions of Taxpayer Dollars Wasted Annually in Redundant Federal Programs", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/04/13/Billions-Taxpayer-Dollars-Wasted-Annually-Redundant-Federal-Programs", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/07122011_Government_Waste_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/04/13/Billions-Taxpayer-Dollars-Wasted-Annually-Redundant-Federal-Programs", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/07122011_Government_Waste_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Despite efforts by Congress and the Obama administration, the federal government is still hemorrhaging tens of billions dollars every year on duplicative programs.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Despite efforts by Congress and the Obama administration, the federal government is still hemorrhaging tens of billions dollars every year on duplicative programs.\nMeanwhile, there is also redundant federal spending on health insurance coverage for individuals transitioning between Medicaid and federally subsidized state exchanges set up via Obamacare.\n\u201cTaking action at just three agencies -- the Department of Defense, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Internal Revenue Service -- if we did just those three, we would save literally billions upon billions of dollars.\u201d\nForty-one percent of those have been implemented, which has saved taxpayers approximately $56 billion; another $69 billion could be saved in the next decade.\n\u201cWhy do we need to come back year after year to discuss the same actions?\u201d asked chair Jason Chaffetz (R-UT)."}
