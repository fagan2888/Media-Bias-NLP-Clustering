The letter, which has been read by the trial judge, has been placed in the case file, but no action has been taken.\n\nHarleme Larry, who was 14 at the time of the shooting death of Agustin Hernandez in Dade City and is now 18, was found guilty of first-degree murder in June following two days of testimony. Deliberations took place over two days.\n\nLarry was sentenced in September to life in prison with the possibility of parole in 25 years.\n\nThe letter alleges some in the jury room during deliberations spoke about information that was not available to them in the courtroom. The writer suggests it came from news accounts of the trial\u2019s coverage.\n\n\u201cIt was not apparent at the time, or even noticed by me, which I cannot speak for any of the other jurors,\u201d the letter said, \u201cthat there was an incredible amount of information being said inside that jury room that was absolutely NOT information any of the jurors were privileged to know!!!! Information that was confusing and confounding!\u201d\n\n\u201cNone of this was clear to me until the very next day,\u201d the letter writer said. \u201cNot until I took the time to actually look up this information and read about it myself. Everything that was true, but unknown to the jury, was there, flying around in that jury room! I just felt saddened and angry.\u201d\n\nAttorneys Tom Hanlon and Dillon Vizcarra of the public defender\u2019s office, who represented Larry during the trial, want the juror to come forward.\n\n\u201cRight now, the case is under appeal, so we\u2019ve got to get permission to get this thing back into the trial court,\u201d Vizcarra said. \u201cWhat we\u2019d like to see happen, if they would interview the jurors, and of course find out if there was something inappropriate done, which is clearly what happened with the jurors.\n\n\u201cIf the jurors were given inappropriate information and it had a bearing on their verdict, I would think that any judge would grant a new trial and would start over with things the way they should be and not the way they were in this particular case.\u201d\n\nThe appeals process, which is underway, is expected to take a minimum of two years.\n\nVizcarra and Hanlon said they have never had a similar situation arise after a trial.\n\n\u201cIn 30 years, this is my first time,\u201d Hanlon said.\n\nIf there is ever an issue, it\u2019s usually addressed well before a verdict is handed out, Vizcarra said.\n\n\u201cMost jurors, what they do is they bring it up to the bailiff,\u201d Vizcarra said. \u201cThere\u2019s a bailiff responsible for their welfare and answering any questions, kind of like a liaison between the judge and themselves. They would bring (any issue) up to the bailiff\u2019s attention, and then the judge will deal with it right then.\u201d\n\nAssistant State Attorney Manny Garcia, who with Phil Matthey prosecuted the case, said questions have to be asked if there is any validity to the letter. Furthermore, why was it sent anonymously?\n\n\u201cThe difficulty in this is, is that letter truly from a juror that sat on the case or is that letter from an anonymous person that didn\u2019t sit on the case,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cBecause if you were that concerned with what transpired in the jury room and concerned that the defendant did not get a fair shake or a fair trial and you were that adamant, then why wouldn\u2019t you want it known that you are the person that\u2019s writing this letter?\u201d\n\nAnd just like the defense attorneys, Garcia has also never had a juror \u2014 anonymous or otherwise \u2014 write a letter about the deliberation process.\n\nBoth sides agree there is the possibility that Circuit Judge Pat Siracusa, who presided over the case, could examine the accusation further by having each juror come in and admit or deny writing the letter.\n\nGarcia said it could be a situation where jurors are brought in and no one confesses to writing the letter. Then things get murky.\n\n\u201cWell, where does that put us,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cObviously, somebody was tampering with the judicial system then if it wasn\u2019t any of the jurors that were there.\u201d\n\nDuring the early morning hours of July 10, 2010, Larry approached a group of men near 37303 Oak St. and robbed one of them of $4, according to investigators. One of the men, Hernandez, 31, was shot in his chest. He was taken to a hospital, where he later died.\n\nTwo days after the murder, Larry was driven to the Pasco Sheriff\u2019s Office\u2019s District 2 station in Dade City and confessed to the killing. That confession was recorded and later played for the jury of nine women and three men during the trial.\n\nLarry testified he was coerced into a confession by his friend Derrick Wright. He said he was driven to the station by Wright\u2019s aunt, while Larry and Wright sat in the car and went over a phony confession.\n\nLarry is housed in the Suwannee Correctional Institution in Live Oak. He\u2019ll be eligible for parole in 2039.\n\n\u201cWe need somebody to be able to come back and do the right thing,\u201d Hanlon said. \u201cEvidently, there was something that we didn\u2019t know about, that nobody knew about and (someone wrote the letter) anonymously. We need someone to come forward and say, listen, this was a 14-year-old kid, we need to do everything we can to make sure justice is right.\u201d\n\nedaniels@tampatrib.com\n\n(813) 371-1860\n\nTwitter: @EDanielsTBO", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sun, 09 Feb 2014 12:04:38 -0400", "Description": "DADE CITY \u2014 Nearly eight months after a Dade City teen was found guilty of a 2010 murder, an anonymous letter writer who claims to have been a juror in the case says the verdict may have been", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "DADE CITY \u2014 Nearly eight months after a Dade City teen was found guilty of a 2010 murder, an anonymous letter writer who claims to have been a juror in the case says the verdict may have been", "title": "Pasco murder conviction questioned", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/pasco-county/pasco-murder-conviction-questioned-20140209/", "image": {"width": 133, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140209/ARTICLE/140209346/AR/0/AR-140209346.jpg", "height": 211}, "updated_time": "2014-02-09T12:04:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "DADE CITY \u2014 Nearly eight months after a Dade City teen was found guilty of a 2010 murder, an anonymous letter writer who claims to have been a juror in the case says the verdict may have bee", "title": "Pasco murder conviction questioned", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140209/ARTICLE/140209346/AR/0/AR-140209346.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2014-02-09T12:04:38Z-04", "modified_time": "2014-02-09T12:04:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Two days after the murder, Larry was driven to the Pasco Sheriff\u2019s Office\u2019s District 2 station in Dade City and confessed to the killing.\nThe letter, which has been read by the trial judge, has been placed in the case file, but no action has been taken.\nThe letter alleges some in the jury room during deliberations spoke about information that was not available to them in the courtroom.\nInformation that was confusing and confounding!\u201d\u201cNone of this was clear to me until the very next day,\u201d the letter writer said.\nGarcia said it could be a situation where jurors are brought in and no one confesses to writing the letter."}
