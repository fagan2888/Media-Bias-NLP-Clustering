During that time, you would learn every component of that car, its speed, its strengths and weaknesses, and you would eventually become one with the car. But then, on the day of the race, when your blood is pumping and adrenaline is flowing, race officials stepped down and ordered that you would not be able to use the car you practiced with, instead using a different car that they deemed appropriate.\n\nThis is what some special operators of our U.S. military go through everyday and they are finally voicing their humble opinion.\n\nAccording to Fox News:\n\nAfter SEALs return from a deployment, their rifles are given to other commandos who are shipping out, said Hunter, a former Marine who served three combat tours in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Without this confidence, split-second mistakes can ultimately lead to death.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Imagine if you were race car driver and for 2 years you prepared for the Daytona 500 by driving endless practice laps with the same car.
