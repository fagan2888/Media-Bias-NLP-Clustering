Spaulding faces an uphill battle in the Democratic race, which is expected to include Attorney General Roy Cooper.\n\nDURHAM \u2013 It was a Spaulding family affair during gubernatorial candidate Ken Spaulding\u2019s recent meet and greet with the public.\n\n\n\nSpaulding, his wife Wendy, and cousin Vince, were just a few of the family members who thanked residents for coming out. Spaulding said the reception was a way to show his appreciation to those who have supported him since his candidacy for governor announcement a year ago.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been so many people who have been so kind to us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been campaigning all across the state, and we have people from all different counties here.\u201d\n\nSpaulding said the 2016 election is a people\u2019s campaign. So often candidates focus on their running, but in North Carolina it\u2019s all about the people.\n\nHe decided to run he said when he did not see things happening the way he would\u2019ve hoped.\n\n\n\n\u201cPeople are hurting out here,\u201d he said. \u201cI really hoped our leaders would\u2019ve stepped forward to really take on this McCrory administration and the extremist legislative majority.\u201d\n\nAttorney General Roy Cooper is also expected to run for governor, but Spaulding said Cooper has been defending many of Gov. Pat McCrory\u2019s policies like \u201cvoter suppression, (no) teacher tenure and (lack of) marriage equality.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cRoy Cooper\u2019s office has been defending those actions, so if he had planned to be the nominee, then I think (it\u2019d be) a good race between the two of us. The voters would get a chance to have a choice as to who they think best represents them,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nDebra Johnson said she wants to see improvements in North Carolina\u2019s education and tax system.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s several things that are going on now in North Carolina. It\u2019s not fair. Asking you to show ID for the vote; that\u2019s not fair,\u201d she said. \u201cSeveral things I\u2019m not pleased with now in North Carolina.\u201d\n\n\n\nWendy Spaulding said as potential first lady, she hopes to tackle the state\u2019s poverty problem.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something that\u2019s very dear and close to my heart as someone who grew up poor, I understand the face of poverty and all I have to do is look in the mirror and I see it,\u201d she said.\n\nVince Spaulding, who serves as campaign treasurer, said one of the most interesting and gratifying parts of campaigning has been to see how receptive folks are to Spaulding\u2019s campaign.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen we call folks and ask them for contributions, everybody seems to be enthusiastic about his willingness to run and his possibility of being successful,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nWhen asked what he thought about the possibility of North Carolina electing a black governor, family friend Ed Ellis said ,\u201cI think it\u2019s time for North Carolina to have a black governor, and he could be, and would be, I think, the first to do that; and if he makes it, that would be a plus for our great state.\u201d\n\n\n\nDurham County Commissioner Brenda Howerton, who is a friend of Wendy Spaulding, said she doesn\u2019t think \u201cblack or white\u201d matters.\n\n\n\n\u201cI think having the right person in office that cares about the community and cares about the people of the state is the main thing \u2013 doesn\u2019t matter what color they are,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nSpaulding said he plans to get votes according to his ethics and not his ethnicity.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis election will be in 2016 and, yeah, they\u2019ll have presidential elections, but I want to be able to at least convey the message so that we all together realize something that I didn\u2019t realize awhile back: The federal government can\u2019t do everything,\u201d he said. \u201cWe see on the Affordable Care Act how we tried nationally. They came forth with the legislation to help people, but here in North Carolina on the state level, we did not go along with Medicaid expansion, so therefore we have over half a million people that need health care in North Carolina who are suffering. So these decisions are not only federal decisions that take place and impact our lives, but, in particular, our state and local elections are very important in our everyday lives.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn the Net:\n\nSpaulding campaign\n\nwww.kenspaulding.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.thecharlottepost.com/news/2014/08/05/local/darkhorse-candidate-gets-warm-and-familiar-welcome", "type": "website"}, "keywords": "Charlotte Newspaper, Charlotte African American News, Charlotte Minority owned newspaper, Black community, African-American news, leading source", "description": "Leading source of News affecting African American community in Charlotte North Carolina.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0c3f\"", "article_summary": "DURHAM \u2013 It was a Spaulding family affair during gubernatorial candidate Ken Spaulding\u2019s recent meet and greet with the public.\nSo often candidates focus on their running, but in North Carolina it\u2019s all about the people.\n\u201cThere\u2019s several things that are going on now in North Carolina.\nSpaulding, his wife Wendy, and cousin Vince, were just a few of the family members who thanked residents for coming out.\nbyPHOTO/LATISHA CATCHATOORIAN N.C. gubernatorial candidate Kenneth Spaulding greets supporters last month at a Durham reception."}
