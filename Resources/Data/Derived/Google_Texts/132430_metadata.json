Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, faced intense opposition back home for his stance of no hearings and no votes for a Supreme Court nominee, but a town hall video shows a different picture.\n\n\u201cWe want to thank you for being courageous and holding that position because many people, elected officials, go to Washington and they don\u2019t do what they said they were going to do,\u201d Janae Stracke, born and raised in Iowa, told Grassley at a town hall event at Northwestern College, a small Christian school in Orange City, Iowa.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re saying what you said you\u2019re going to do, and you\u2019re being effective and efficient with the time that you\u2019re in the Senate to get other stuff done while this other situation is going on,\u201d Stracke added.\n\nGrassley, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which reviews judicial appointments, has stood firm that the Senate will not vote on any Supreme Court nominee to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia, a conservative, until the next president takes office.\n\n\u201cWe want to thank you for that position,\u201d Stracke, who represents Concerned Women for America, told Grassley. Her remarks were followed by \u201cthe biggest applause of the day,\u201d the Sioux City Journal reported.\n\nLast month, President Barack Obama nominated Merrick Garland, a federal appeals court judge, to fill the Supreme Court vacancy.\n\nAccording to Grassley\u2019s press office, the senator spoke to Garland on the evening of April 4 and invited the judge to a breakfast on April 12, where they can \u201cdiscuss the nomination and why the Senate will not consider a nominee until the next president takes office.\u201d\n\nGrassley spoke April 5 on the Senate floor on the public perception of the Supreme Court. He said, according to prepared remarks:\n\nThere are four justices who vote in a liberal way in effectively every case the public follows. There are two justices who stick to the constitutional text and vote in a consistently conservative way. One justice votes mostly but not always in a conservative way. And one justice votes sometimes with the conservatives and sometimes with the liberals. All of the liberals were appointed by Democrats. The conservatives and the swing justices were appointed by Republicans.\n\n\u2018Simply Not the Case\u2019\n\nThe week of March 27, Grassley held three town hall events in the mostly rural, strongly conservative northwest corner of Iowa, as part of his annual 99-county tour. He has visited every county across the state in each of the past 35 years.\n\nGrassley held the town meetings\u2014in Ocheyedan, Rock Rapids, and Orange City\u2014while the Senate was in recess.\n\nNews reports from the events include headlines such as these: \u201cIn Iowa, Grassley takes flak for court stance\u201d (The Des Moines Register), \u201cWhy won\u2019t Grassley hold Supreme Court hearings? He fears Republicans more than Democrats\u201d (The Washington Post), and \u201cSupreme Court vise closes on Grassley\u201d (Politico).\n\nThe Register reported that in Orange City, \u201cGrassley faced support and opposition to his Supreme Court stance in roughly equal measure at the town hall.\u201d\n\nConcerned Women for America\u2019s Stracke, in a letter to the editor in response to the newspaper\u2019s coverage, said:\n\nBut that was simply not the case. I can\u2019t speak for the support overall, but I was there at all three town halls this week, and the vast majority of people were supportive of Sen. Grassley.\n\nMedia Reports \u2018Misleading\u2019\n\nAt the town meeting in Rock Rapids, Grassley \u201cwas taking a beating from people who wanted to see him act to confirm Merrick Garland,\u201d The Post reported.\n\nA local chiropractor in Rock Rapids, Dr. Cody Hoefert, 38, told The Daily Signal another version of the town meeting, which he attended. He said that an \u201coverwhelming majority\u201d of the approximately 125 to 140 attendees appeared to support Grassley\u2019s position.\n\n\u201cThere was a large turnout,\u201d Hoefert, also co-chairman of the Iowa Republican Party, said. \u201cThere was lot of interest in Senator Grassley and a lot of interest in the Supreme Court.\u201d\n\n\u201cI got frustrated, because the headlines in the stories were \u2018Grassley\u2019s under pressure,\u2019 and that was the opposite of the reality of what was on the ground in that room,\u201d Hoefert said. \u201cThe headlines were very misleading and quite frankly disappointing.\u201d He added:\n\nThe overwhelming majority of the people in the room, I would say nine to one, supported the senator and support his position when it comes to the Supreme Court. There were one or two local Democratic operative folks who were there who asked questions about whether or not it was in the best interest to not hold hearings, but the overwhelming majority of the room was supportive. There were two or three people from out of the county, that didn\u2019t live in the county or even in the area, who had made their way up there and asked some questions trying to make it look as though the senator did not have the support that he had.\n\nAnother local Iowan, Scott Schneiderman, 48, told The Daily Signal that The Des Moines Register and the media in general \u201cmisportrayed the event.\u201d\n\nThe Register\u2019s story \u201cwas written as if the event in Rock Rapids was a 50-50 event,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t even close[.] \u2026 [T]here were only four or five people there that were trying to convince Grassley not to go down his current path.\u201d\n\nSchneiderman, a community banker in Rock Rapids, said of surrounding Lyon County: \u201cWe\u2019re very conservative, very Republican in this county.\u201d\n\nThe few local Democrats who came to the event were, for the most part, \u201crespectful of the senator,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018Very Civilized\u2019\n\nTammy Kobza, 55, who lives near Orange City, attended the Grassley town halls in Rock Rapids and Ocheyedan. She said both events were \u201cvery civilized.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know for certain there were a lot of people that were there supportive of what the senator was doing. The natives were, anyway,\u201d Kobza told The Daily Signal of the event in Ocheyedan. She added:\n\nA lot of Iowans are very thankful that Senator Grassley is doing this. I think he has a lot of statewide support.\n\n.@chuckgrassley will host Judge Garland for breakfast next Tuesday. #SCOTUS \u2014 Senate Judiciary (@senjudiciary) April 5, 2016\n\n\u201cWhen they structured our nation, the founders placed trust in three separate but equal branches of government,\u201d Grassley said in a formal statement March 16 after Obama nominated Garland.
