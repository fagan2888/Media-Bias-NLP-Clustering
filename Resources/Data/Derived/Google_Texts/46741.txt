After reaching new multiyear contracts with tight ends Owen Daniels and Virgil Green, the Broncos didnâ€™t have enough budget room for free-agent defensive lineman Kendall Langford.

The Broncos canceled their visit with Langford and he has now reached an agreement with the Indianapolis Colts.

The Broncos signed Daniels to a three-year, $12 million contract and Green to a three-year, $8.4 million deal. The Broncos entered free agency with roughly $19.5 million in cap space, which means the team will have to hit on some low-pay veterans and the draft.
