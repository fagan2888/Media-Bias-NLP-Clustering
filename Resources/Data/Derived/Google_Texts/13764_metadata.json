Of course, Planned Parenthood denied the claims, but also said that the question about baby parts ending up in landfills is something for their disposal service to answer. The publication added that Mike DeWine, Ohio\u2019s Attorney General, has also notified the state\u2019s Department of Health. He said that Planned Parenthood violated Ohio\u2019s Administrative Code, which states that a \u201cfetus shall be disposed of in a humane manner.\u201d\n\n\"You're really asking a question for the disposal company,\" she said.\n\nAsked where Planned Parenthood thought the fetal remains ended up, if not landfills, Kight responded, \"The Ohio attorney general hasn't said that any law has been broken. What he seems to be upset about is what the law allows.\"\n\nShe said that the new allegations are trying to bury the fact that the investigation found no evidence to support the original allegation that Planned Parenthood sells fetal tissue.\n\nShe said it is \"highly motivated by a political agenda that both the governor and attorney general are pushing right now in Ohio.\"\n\nIn a follow-up call with The Hill, Kight emphasized that the remains end up in a facility that is specially licensed to receive medical material, as prescribed by Ohio law.\n\nShe said it is the same way medical material from other healthcare providers is disposed of. \"Every healthcare provider follows these laws, every surgery center, every hospital,\" she said.\n\nAccording to cleveland.com, DeWine said in a press conference that the disposal system the state found does not violate Ohio law but does violate state administrative code, which states that a \"fetus shall be disposed of in a humane manner.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "Awful.05/27/2016 8:43:05AM EST.", "author": "Matt Vespa", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Awful", "title": "Horror: Aborted Baby Parts Are Ending Up In Landfills, Says Ohio Attorney General", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2015/12/12/horror-aborted-baby-parts-are-ending-up-in-landfills-says-ohio-attorney-general-n2093010", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/341/2015-12-03T012027Z_1_LYNXMPEBB201H_RTROPTP_3_COLORADO-SHOOTER-NEW-YORK.JPG", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Awful", "title": "Horror: Aborted Baby Parts Are Ending Up In Landfills, Says Ohio Attorney General", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2015/12/12/horror-aborted-baby-parts-are-ending-up-in-landfills-says-ohio-attorney-general-n2093010", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/341/2015-12-03T012027Z_1_LYNXMPEBB201H_RTROPTP_3_COLORADO-SHOOTER-NEW-YORK.JPG", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Horror: Aborted Baby Parts Are Ending Up In Landfills, Says Ohio Attorney General , Matt Vespa, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "The publication added that Mike DeWine, Ohio\u2019s Attorney General, has also notified the state\u2019s Department of Health.\nAsked where Planned Parenthood thought the fetal remains ended up, if not landfills, Kight responded, \"The Ohio attorney general hasn't said that any law has been broken.\nOf course, Planned Parenthood denied the claims, but also said that the question about baby parts ending up in landfills is something for their disposal service to answer.\nShe said it is \"highly motivated by a political agenda that both the governor and attorney general are pushing right now in Ohio.\"\nIn a follow-up call with The Hill, Kight emphasized that the remains end up in a facility that is specially licensed to receive medical material, as prescribed by Ohio law."}
