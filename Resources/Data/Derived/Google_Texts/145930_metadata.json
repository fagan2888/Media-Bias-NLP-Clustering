Those penalties are being assessed on hospitals considered to have too many patients requiring readmission for care within a month after their discharge.\n\nFor 2016, Medicare will also begin scoring hospitals for their numbers of surgical-site infections.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Champaign,Urbana,Danville,Paxton,Rantoul,Mahomet,Monticello,Tuscola,East Central Illinois,University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,News", "og": {"url": "http://www.news-gazette.com/news/local/2014-12-27/carle-sarah-bush-lincoln-hospitals-facing-medicare-penalities.html", "image": "http://news-gazette.com/sites/all/themes/custom/ng_fbg/images/social.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "They are among the 27 in Illinois being penalized for having too many avoidable complications and infections.", "title": "Carle, Sarah Bush Lincoln hospitals facing Medicare penalities"}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2015 The News-Gazette, Inc.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "URBANA \u2014 Two East Central Illinois hospitals are among the 27 in Illinois being penalized by Medicare for having too many avoidable complications and infections."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe4e95\"", "article_summary": "URBANA \u2014 Two East Central Illinois hospitals are among the 27 in Illinois being penalized by Medicare for having too many avoidable complications and infections.\nCarle Foundation Hospital in Urbana and Sarah Bush Lincoln Health Center in Coles County are among the 721 U.S. hospitals seeing their Medicare payments slashed by 1 percent for the 12 months from Oct. 1, 2014, to Sept. 30, 2015.\nFor 2016, Medicare will also begin scoring hospitals for their numbers of surgical-site infections.\nAbout a quarter of the hospitals evaluated for hospital-acquired conditions in Illinois are being fined, with smaller, critical-access hospitals being exempt.\nThose penalties are being assessed on hospitals considered to have too many patients requiring readmission for care within a month after their discharge."}
