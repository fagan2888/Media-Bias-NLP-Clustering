A long-time fixture in the town, Rotobec USA will mark its 30th anniversary in 2016 with the opening of an expansion that will triple the size of the company’s current facility and more than double its workforce...A privately owned business founded in Sainte-Justine, Quebec in 1975, Rotobec has had a distribution and design facility in Littleton since 1986.The company’s name is a combination of its being located in Quebec and a manufacturer of rotating hydraulic systems for the forestry, scrap recycling, waste handling, railroad maintenance, construction and bulk material handling industries...Robert Bouchard, the president of Rotobec, said the company rented several spaces in town before constructing a 10,000-square-foot warehouse in the Littleton Industrial Park in 2000.Beginning with a groundbreaking ceremony on July 22, however, that building will eventually be enlarged by 23,000 square feet. It will also include the fabrication of knuckle-boom loaders, something that will see Rotobec USA hire 25 new employees as welders, machinists and mechanics. Rotobec presently has 17 employees in Littleton...The expansion is prompted by increased customer demand in the U.S. market for Rotobec products, said Bouchard, who added that the imprimatur of “Made in the USA” should be a strong selling point for the loaders that will be made in Littleton...Thirty years ago, Rotobec came to Littleton because it is centrally located between the company’s Canadian headquarters and clients throughout New England, said Bouchard, adding that the town’s proximity to major highways was a key factor in Rotobec’s initial decision to come south...Over time, Rotobec realized it needed even more distribution capacity in Littleton, and three years ago it began considering not only an expansion but adding manufacturing there, too, Bouchard said.Although it could have expanded anywhere, Bouchard said Rotobec — which in 2011 was named one of the 50 Best Managed Companies in Canada — chose to stay in Littleton because of the opportunity to hire qualified employees and because the state of New Hampshire had a willingness to help train those employees for careers at Rotobec...The expanded Rotobec plant in Littleton is expected to open in March 2016, said Bouchard, with the first knuckle-boom loaders set to go out the door to customers two months later.Greg Eastman, who is president of the Littleton Industrial Development Corp., hailed the Rotobec expansion, which he noted comes on the heels of the expansions of two other industrial park tenants, Genfoot and Tender Corp. Cumulatively, the nearly 400-acre industrial park has 13 operating companies, which have upward of 1,500 employees...“The Littleton area business community is very fortunate to have a very successful Canadian company investing in our local economy,” Eastman said. “The company has chosen to expand again in Littleton given among other variables, our skilled labor force. The company is in a booming industry, and we are delighted they are expanding here.”..In 2014, Genfoot, which is based in Lachine, Quebec, said it will quadruple the size of its Kamik boot plant in Littleton. Tender Corp., which was founded in Littleton in 1973, said it, too, is growing. The company makes AfterBite, an insect-bite treatment, as well as insect repellents, first aid kits, burn remedies and survival products...Tender Corp’s new 117,000-square-foot facility “is progressing nicely on schedule,” said Eastman, while Genfoot’s 140,000-square-foot expansion is “working through its own process.”..
