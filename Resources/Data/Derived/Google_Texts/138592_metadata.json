Farmers say that if they\u2019re going to have to find legal workers, the government must make sure there\u2019s a supply of legal foreign workers available, through the H-2A program.\n\n\u201cIt is imperative that any effort to implement mandatory E-Verify be coupled with a solution to agriculture\u2019s unique labor needs,\u201d the lawmakers, led by Rep. Dan Newhouse, Washington Republican, said in a letter to House leaders. \u201cFailure to couple these reforms together would create an unworkable situation for American agriculture.\u201d\n\nBut that coupling is exactly what Republican leaders had been trying to avoid, hoping instead to take the immigration issue step by step, beginning with enforcement. Republicans were already divided over what kinds of enforcement to pass, with the leading border security bill deemed too weak for many in the GOP.\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s executive action in November granting a temporary deportation amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants has also complicated matters, with some Republicans insisting Congress\u2018 first step must be to find a way to reverse the amnesty. But several major attempts have fallen victim to a Democratic filibuster in the Senate, and Republican leaders have been unwilling to use Congress\u2018 power of the purse to engage in a major showdown on the matter with Mr. Obama.\n\nWith immigration stuck in gridlock Tamar Jacoby, president of ImmigrationWorks USA, said Congress should consider a small pilot program to test guest-worker changes. She said one option would be to allow more workers in places where unemployment has already dropped below 5 percent, which is a signal of a strong job market that could use more employees.\n\n\u201cThe idea is a small program, and the key to it is then you study it and find out, did it reduce wages, did it reduce unauthorized immigration in those areas,\u201d she said.\n\nMs. Jacoby said the demand for workers is picking up along with the economy, and all sides will see evidence of that this week, when U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services is expected to announce the country has already exceeded its annual cap on H-1B visa applications, after just a week.\n\nThe window opens April 1 every year, and Congress has allotted a total of 85,000 visas, with 20,000 of those going specifically to foreigners who obtained master\u2019s degrees at U.S. universities.\n\nDuring the economic slump, demand was low. It took most of the year to meet the cap in fiscal year 2011 and 2012. But all the visas were scooped up in just five business days the past two years, and analysts expect that to be the case this year as well.\n\nBut Jim Jefferies, president of IEEE-USA, which advocates for tech workers, said the visa numbers aren\u2019t a good measure of demand, arguing that many companies submit many more applications than they need in an effort to boost their chances of winning.\n\nHe also said the companies that tend to scoop up the visas are ones that outsource their work to foreigners already \u2014 which he said is a bad deal for the U.S. economy.\n\n\u201cH-1B visas are simply not that valuable,\u201d Mr. Jefferies said. \u201cIf they were, the federal government would not give them away at random in a way that clearly favors outsourcing companies.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "With the push for a broad immigration bill now dead in Congress, business advocates are ramping up their calls for Republicans who run both chambers to at least consider updating the nation's guest-worker programs to help boost the economy.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "With the push for a broad immigration bill now dead in Congress, business advocates are ramping up their calls for Republicans who run both chambers to at least consider updating the nation\u2019s guest-worker programs to help boost the economy.", "title": "Congress immigration debate turns to guest workers, high-tech visas for businesses", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/5/congress-immigration-debate-turns-to-guest-workers/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/13/85caaee6e05c1f30680f6a706700180f.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/13/85caaee6e05c1f30680f6a706700180f.jpg", "description": "With the push for a broad immigration bill now dead in Congress, business advocates are ramping up their calls for Republicans who run both chambers to at least consider updating the nation's guest-wo", "card": "summary", "title": "Congress immigration debate turns to guest workers, high-tech visas fo"}, "Author": "Stephen Dinan", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Social Issues, Politics, Congress"}, "article_summary": "With immigration stuck in gridlock Tamar Jacoby, president of ImmigrationWorks USA, said Congress should consider a small pilot program to test guest-worker changes.\nCitizenship and Immigration Services is expected to announce the country has already exceeded its annual cap on H-1B visa applications, after just a week.\nFarmers say that if they\u2019re going to have to find legal workers, the government must make sure there\u2019s a supply of legal foreign workers available, through the H-2A program.\n\u201cIf they were, the federal government would not give them away at random in a way that clearly favors outsourcing companies.\u201d\nMs. Jacoby said the demand for workers is picking up along with the economy, and all sides will see evidence of that this week, when U.S."}
