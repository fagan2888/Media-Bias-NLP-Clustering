No new individual Community Health Options plans will be sold through the federal marketplace, Healthcare.gov, after Dec. 26.\n\nThe move does not affect any plan renewals, and Community Health Options will not stop selling new group plans.\n\nCommunity Health Options, which is based in Lewiston, made the announcement Wednesday after consulting the Maine Bureau of Insurance and the New Hampshire Insurance Department. Co-op leaders said they made the decision to suspend individual sales because the co-op had experienced both extraordinary enrollment growth over the past two years and higher-than-expected claims in 2015.\n\n\u201cWe need to be responsible and work within the reserves that we have available,\u201d said CEO Kevin Lewis. \u201cI think it\u2019s a responsible measure in light of our current membership and the growth trajectory that we\u2019re on.\u201d\n\nThe Maine Bureau of Insurance has been working with the co-op to evaluate its options. Superintendent Eric Cioppa approved the plan to halt new individual sales.\n\nIn a statement released Wednesday, Cioppa said the decision was based on the co-op\u2019s third quarter financial statements, which showed a significant loss. And, since the co-op is responsible for more than 80 percent of the individual plans bought by Mainers through federal marketplace, its first priority is to its existing customers, he said.\n\nA bureau spokesman said the freeze on new plan sales is unusual. But, he said, it should be considered within the context of the new insurance environment created by the 2010 Affordable Care Act, including the fact that companies in the co-op\u2019s situation are not allowed to raise rates until January 2017.\n\nCo-ops are health insurance companies run by members for members. They were created through the Affordable Care Act in an effort to increase competition among health insurers and to provide consumers with greater choice in the marketplace.\n\nCommunity Health Options began selling plans in 2013 and quickly rocketed to the top of Maine\u2019s individual health insurance market, attracting members with its low premiums, broad network of doctors and hospitals and unique program benefits. Initially, it expected to serve 15,500 members in its first year and grow to 40,000 members by 2019.\n\nIt now has about 76,000 members in Maine and New Hampshire.\n\nAt one point, Community Health Options was the only profitable co-op in the country. But last month, it said it had begun losing money and was operating at a deficit because insurance claims were higher than expected.\n\nLewis said then that the co-op had enough capital to offset the anticipated $18 million shortfall and was not in danger of closing.\n\nHe said Wednesday that Community Health Options is still not in any danger of closing.\n\n\u201cNot in the slightest,\u201d Lewis said.\n\nHe believes Community Health Options will resume individual sales \u201cat some point in the not-so-distant future.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhether that happens over the course of 2016 or it\u2019s timed in line with open enrollment for 2017 has yet to be determined,\u201d he said.\n\nAlthough Community Health Options will stop selling new individual plans this month, other insurers will continue. They include Aetna, Anthem and Harvard Pilgrim Health Care/HPHC.\n\nAetna plans are not sold through the federal marketplace, which means they cannot be bought using a federal subsidy.\n\nCommunity Health Options\u2019 news comes during a rough period for co-ops nationwide. So far this year, 12 of the country\u2019s 23 co-ops have closed or announced plans to close, largely due to federal money that did not come through as expected.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Lewiston-based Maine Community Health Options announced it will limit individual enrollments for the health care plans it offers on the federal marketplace created by the Affordable Care Act.
