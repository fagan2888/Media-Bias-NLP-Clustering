But her leadership in the Ukraine crisis last year, her clinching of a deal this summer to keep Greece in the euro zone and her stance in the refugee crisis have changed that view.\n\nIn late August, when tens of thousands of migrants fleeing war in the Middle East streamed into Hungary, threatening a humanitarian crisis, Merkel agreed to suspend the European Union\u2019s asylum rules and allow them to continue into Germany. She declared to skeptical countrymen: \u201cWir schaffen das,\u201d which translates as, \"We can do this.\"\n\nHer \u201copen-door\u201d stance has led to a fall in support for her conservatives and in her own popularity ratings, which have slid to 54 percent from 75 percent over eight months.\n\nTime also noted her leadership this year in leading the West's response to Vladimir Putin's \"creeping theft of Ukraine\" and welcoming refugees to Germany despite \"the reflex to slam doors, build walls and trust no one.\"\n\nMerkel topped a short list of finalists that included U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, who came in third, and Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who was runner-up.\n\nShe is the first individual woman to hold the title since Corazon Aquino in 1986, though women have been honored as part of a group. Last year, a group of Ebola doctors and survivors won the title.\n\n(Reporting by Megan Cassella in Washington; Additional reporting by Joseph Nasr and Noah Barkin in Berlin; Editing by Nick Zieminski)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Time magazine named German Chancellor Angela Merkel its 2015 \"P", "title": "German chancellor Merkel named Time's 'Person of the Year'", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/12/09/German-chancellor-Angela-Merkel-named-Person-Year-Time", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/people-time-merkel_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/12/09/German-chancellor-Angela-Merkel-named-Person-Year-Time", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/people-time-merkel_2.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Time magazine named German Chancellor Angela Merkel its 2015 \"P", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Merkel celebrated her 10-year anniversary as chancellor last month, making her the European Union\u2019s longest-serving leader.\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Time magazine named German Chancellor Angela Merkel its 2015 \"Person of the Year\" on Wednesday, noting her resilience and leadership when faced with the refugee crisis and turmoil in the European Union over its currency this year.\nIn response to the news, Merkel spokesman Steffen Seibert told a government news conference: \"I am sure the chancellor will cherish this as an incentive in her job.\"\n(Reporting by Megan Cassella in Washington; Additional reporting by Joseph Nasr and Noah Barkin in Berlin; Editing by Nick Zieminski)\nIn late August, when tens of thousands of migrants fleeing war in the Middle East streamed into Hungary, threatening a humanitarian crisis, Merkel agreed to suspend the European Union\u2019s asylum rules and allow them to continue into Germany."}
