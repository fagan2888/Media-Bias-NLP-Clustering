Leaked documents have revealed some specifics, leaving consumer watchdog groups suspicious over a process intended to streamline labor policies and food labeling guidelines that would align the U.S. with partnering countries..\n\nIndividuals connected to some of the nation\u2019s largest corporate interests have been involved in the process, including former Monsanto lobbyist Islam Siddiqui, who is the head agricultural negotiator for the TPP on behalf of the U.S. Prior to his work as a GMO lobbyist with CropLife, he worked as the head agricultural trade advisor for the Clinton administration.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nCountries involved in the TPP include the U.S., Australia, Brunei, Chile, Canada, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Singapore and Vietnam.\n\nCountries like Japan, where GMO labeling is required, could find themselves in a global partnership intended to eliminate barriers for trade \u2014 and separate labeling for Japanese consumers would be out of the question, according to NationofChange, a nonprofit news and advocacy organization.\n\n\u201cThe labeling of foods containing GMOs (Genetically Modified Organisms) will not be allowed,\u201d writes Barbara Chicherio in a NationofChange op-ed. \u201cJapan currently has labeling laws for GMOs in food. Under the TPP Japan would no longer be able to label GMOs. This situation is the same for New Zealand and Australia. In the US we are just beginning to see some progress towards labeling GMOs. Under the TPP GMO labels for US food would not be allowed.\u201d\n\nVietnam is another nation that has been wary to latch on to Monsanto\u2019s growing global influence. As a nation that was devastated by Monsanto-produced, U.S.-military-delivered Agent Orange \u2014 which killed or injured an estimated 400,000 and caused another 500,000 instances of birth defects during and after the Vietnam War \u2014 it\u2019s seen as a touchy subject. If TPP goes through, laws could override such concerns.\n\nThe nations involved in the TPP represent 30 percent of the globe\u2019s agricultural industry, which would create a steady market for Monsanto as it seeks to maintain its position as the leading seed producer in the world, particularly at a time of growing resistance to the company and GMOs in general.\n\nEuropean nations have already taken a stand against Monsanto, with eight countries banning the use of GMO seeds, citing health concerns and cases in which agricultural workers have been poisoned by the large quantity of pesticides GMO plants are designed to absorb.\n\nPaul Francois, a 47-year-old French man who suffered neurological disorders after exposure to Monsanto chemicals, sued the company \u2014 and won.\n\n\u201cIt is a historic decision insofar as it is the first time that a pesticide maker is found guilty of such a poisoning,\u201d Francois\u2019 lawyer told Reuters.\n\nIt\u2019s cases like this that have rallied support within countries where much of the public opposes GMOs \u2014 and it\u2019s cases like this that are leading Monsanto to hold on to trade agreements that could give them an edge up in the global market.\n\nThe TPP negotiations are expected to wrap up at some point within 2013.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Monsanto stands to win big from the latest free-trade deal currently being negotiated. , Agent Orange, GMOs, Japan, labeling, Monstano, Trans-Pacific Partnership, Vietnam,", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Trisha Marczak", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "Monsanto stands to win big from the latest free-trade deal currently being negotiated. , Agent Orange, GMOs, Japan, labeling, Monstano, Trans-Pacific Partnership, Vietnam,", "title": "Trans Pacific Partnership Might Include International Ban On GMO Labeling", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/monsanto-trans-pacific-partnership-bans-gmo-labeling/168797/", "image": "http://mnpprodpublic.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/091113_monsanto_16x9-690x388.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-09-11T14:05:02-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Monsanto stands to win big from the latest free-trade deal currently being negotiated. , Agent Orange, GMOs, Japan, labeling, Monstano, Trans-Pacific Partnership, Vietnam,", "creator": "@TrishaMarczakMP", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/091113_monsanto_4x3.jpg", "title": "Trans Pacific Partnership Might Include International Ban On GMO Labeling", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Daily Digest", "tag": "Vietnam", "published_time": "2013-09-12T05:02:37-05:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-11T14:05:02-05:00"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1bb9\"", "article_summary": "Trans Pacific Partnership Might Include International Ban On GMO LabelingMonsanto stands to win big from the latest free-trade deal currently being negotiated.\nIn the US we are just beginning to see some progress towards labeling GMOs.\nPrior to his work as a GMO lobbyist with CropLife, he worked as the head agricultural trade advisor for the Clinton administration.\nUnder the TPP GMO labels for US food would not be allowed.\u201dVietnam is another nation that has been wary to latch on to Monsanto\u2019s growing global influence.\nUnder the TPP Japan would no longer be able to label GMOs."}
