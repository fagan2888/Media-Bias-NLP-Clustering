Yields have been attractive and valuations have largely been an afterthought.\u201cThis year, investors will need to pay more attention to valuations in order to pick the best opportunities.\"There will be significant differences in how various economies perform in 2014, Padowitz said.\u201cFor instance, the US is looking very strong, with an improving labour market, oil and shale revolution, manufacturing renaissance and strengthening housing markets. However, Europe is treading water, and China is making the difficult transition from investment to consumption, and may experience a credit crisis.\u201dPadowitz said as well as the energy sector, some of the best opportunities for international equities are likely to lie in healthcare.The introduction of \u2018Obamacare\u2019 in the US will create mixed opportunities for investors, he said.\u201cCompanies with scale and low costs \u2013 such as large insurance companies and service providers \u2013 will benefit from Obamacare, while those with high profit margins and minimal product differentiation will find the new environment much more challenging. This includes hospitals and medical professionals.\u201dDonald Williams, chief investment officer at Australian equities manager Platypus Asset Management, agreed there are opportunities in healthcare and said there are also a number of positive signs for the domestic market.\u201cWe are now seeing the lagged impact of low domestic interest rates, which are starting to have the effect the RBA was looking for, and the declining Australian dollar is generally positive for earnings.\u201cConsumers are more optimistic; the property market is improving, resulting in a wider wealth effect among Australians; and the IPO market is back which is often a precursor to M and A activity.\u201cAll these indicators lead us to be reasonably bullish for Australian equities, though the February reporting season could be tough, reflecting the ongoing weakness in the economy last year,\u201d he said.Williams predicted a number of positive opportunities for companies in the Australian healthcare sector \u2013 such as Resmed, Ramsay Healthcare, Healthscope and CSL \u2013 because of the falling Australian dollar combined with these companies\u2019 defensive earnings profile.\u201cWe also anticipate a number of healthcare IPOs in 2014 which will create good opportunities for investors.\u201dChris Smith, head of healthcare and retirement property at Australian Unity Investments, said like the rest of the world, growth in healthcare property and services in Australia is \u201cpretty much guaranteed\u201d because of the aging population.\u201cOur aging population and greater longevity, combined with generally increasing prosperity, will lead to greater demand for healthcare, both facilities and services,\u201d he said.\u201cBoth the government and the private sector will need to step in to meet this demand over the next few decades.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Three fund managers are predicting a challenging year ahead for investors, but pinpoint the sectors to watch for 20 - Wealth Professional Magazine", "author": "WP"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1392\"", "article_summary": "Chad Padowitz, chief investment officer at global equities manager Wingate Asset Management, said although there are still good opportunities around, this year will be more challenging than 2013 for investors.\u201cThere was a bit of investor complacency in 2013, as the lack of alternative investment options and low volatility enticed investors back into the equities market.\nYields have been attractive and valuations have largely been an afterthought.\u201cThis year, investors will need to pay more attention to valuations in order to pick the best opportunities.\n\"There will be significant differences in how various economies perform in 2014, Padowitz said.\u201cFor instance, the US is looking very strong, with an improving labour market, oil and shale revolution, manufacturing renaissance and strengthening housing markets.\nHowever, Europe is treading water, and China is making the difficult transition from investment to consumption, and may experience a credit crisis.\u201dPadowitz said as well as the energy sector, some of the best opportunities for international equities are likely to lie in healthcare.The introduction of \u2018Obamacare\u2019 in the US will create mixed opportunities for investors, he said.\u201cCompanies with scale and low costs \u2013 such as large insurance companies and service providers \u2013 will benefit from Obamacare, while those with high profit margins and minimal product differentiation will find the new environment much more challenging.\nThis includes hospitals and medical professionals.\u201dDonald Williams, chief investment officer at Australian equities manager Platypus Asset Management, agreed there are opportunities in healthcare and said there are also a number of positive signs for the domestic market.\u201cWe are now seeing the lagged impact of low domestic interest rates, which are starting to have the effect the RBA was looking for, and the declining Australian dollar is generally positive for earnings.\u201cConsumers are more optimistic;
