In 2012, the company spent $5,000 to support gay marriage in a referendum in Washington, according to data from the National Institute on Money in State Politics.\n\n\n\nThe Center for Public Integrity reviewed 55 publicly traded companies and top corporate givers to ballot measures and found nine instances of curious positions \u2014 positions taken even when the companies\u2019 policies emphasize their business interests as the overriding criteria in doling out political contributions.\n\nThe areas of interest were fairly diverse, but most seemed to focus on social issues or were aimed at fundamental changes to how state government operates.\n\nPlaying politics\n\nWhen spending is aimed at playing politics, rather than business, it raises concerns with activists and shareholders, said Bruce Freed, president of the Center for Political Accountability, a nonprofit that advocates for transparency in corporate political spending.\n\n\u201cCompanies need clear policies, and they need to follow those policies,\u201d he said. \u201cI think there is significant shareholder concern.\u201d\n\nWhat interest Nike had in the Oregon initiative on primaries remains a matter of speculation, as the company did not give a specific explanation when asked. A spokesman said the company gives based on \u201cthe merits of the ballot initiative, including the potential direct or indirect impact to our business.\u201d\n\nNike policy states that political contributions are \u201cto protect or enhance shareholder value.\u201d\n\nCorporate giving to politics has come under more scrutiny since the Supreme Court\u2019s 2010 ruling on Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission opened the door for corporations and unions to spend more advocating for or against candidates.\n\nBut even before that ruling, business interests have been generous givers to ballot measure campaigns, unhampered by limitations since a 1978 Supreme Court ruling.\n\nIn 2014 alone, business interests accounted for more than three-quarters of the $266 million given by top donors to statewide ballot measures.\n\nCourting decision-makers\n\nSome of the contributions that don\u2019t line up with company policy appear to be aimed at building corporate political clout in the states.\n\nCompanies are keen to make governors and legislatures as friendly as possible to business, according to Paul Kelly, a board member of the Association of Government Relations Professionals, which represents lobbyists.\n\nSometimes that means contributing to issues that control how those politicians are elected.\n\nExxon Mobil Corp. opposed public funding of political campaigns and stricter contribution limits in California in 2006.\n\nCompanies may also win friends by giving to ballot measures backed by powerful state leaders.\n\nAT&T Inc. and Altria Group Inc., for example, gave to a pair of California government finance initiatives championed by Gov. Jerry Brown in 2014. In Maine, AT&T, Waste Management Inc. and Coca-Cola Co. were among more than a dozen companies that helped fight the repeal of a governor-backed school consolidation plan in 2009.\n\n\u201cThat, too, can be an effective tactic,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cIt goes on to some degree in order to be involved and help people that you have to work with.\u201d\n\nCoca-Cola\u2019s policy says that it gives politically to benefit the \u201clong-term, sustainable growth of our global beverage business.\u201d\n\nCoca-Cola spokesman Kent Landers said that the company opposed the Maine repeal measure because the company supports education. \u201cEducation is one of the keys to socioeconomic development in the communities in which we operate,\u201d he wrote in an email.\n\nWaste Management said the Maine school plan helped stabilize the state\u2019s budget, which aided the company\u2019s local business interests; Altria and Exxon Mobil did not say specifically how their contributions fit with their policies.\n\nAT&T did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nRisk or reward?\n\nExperts are divided over whether using contributions to create political allies can actually help a company\u2019s bottom line. Robert J. Shapiro, a senior fellow at the Georgetown Center for Business and Public Policy who has written on this issue, said corporate political activity generally boosts business.\n\n\u201cCompanies spend this kind of money because it produces a return,\u201d he said. \u201cCorporations are not irrational actors.\u201d\n\nNot all shareholders agree. Critics of corporate political giving warn of risks to a company\u2019s reputation, citing protests outside retailing giant Target Corp.\u2019s doors in 2010 after the company gave to a pro-business political action committee that backed a candidate who opposed gay marriage.\n\nSince 2014, shareholders have sponsored at least 58 proposals about political spending at annual meetings of Fortune 250 companies, according to an analysis of the Proxy Monitor database, which is sponsored by the Manhattan Institute\u2019s Center for Legal Policy. None passed.\n\nZevin Asset Management, a Boston firm that calls itself a pioneer in socially responsible investing, helped craft one unsuccessful shareholder resolution in 2013 that asked Exxon Mobil to study whether it should stop political giving.\n\n\u201cWe still think there\u2019s reason for concern and risk to shareholder value by companies using funds to influence elections,\u201d said Zevin President Sonia Kowal. \u201cThe returns are unclear.\u201d Click here for more stories in this series\n\nAll or nothing\n\nSome public companies, such as Accenture PLC, make it a policy not to give to ballot measures.\n\nStill others give widely with no concrete policies or explanations \u2014 Wal-Mart Stores Inc., for example, gave at least $100,000 to support the 2014 California government finance measures but has said in documents that sharing the \u201cbusiness rationale\u201d behind political contributions \u201cwould place our company at a competitive disadvantage by revealing our long-term business strategies.\u201d\n\nOther firms have policies explicitly saying they give to a wide range of ballot measures as a form of community involvement. These broader policies are intended to benefit not just stockholders but \u201cstakeholders,\u201d including employees, customers and more.\n\nMicrosoft Corp. has a global public policy agenda that takes stances on the environment, education and other issues. In 2012, it gave $99,500 to support gay marriage in its home state of Washington and earlier this year published a blog post defending its contribution.\n\n\u201cDiversity and inclusion help drive our business and our bottom line,\u201d the company wrote. \u201cOur customers literally are as diverse as the people of the world. To create technology that empowers the world, we need a workforce that reflects the diversity of the world.\u201d\n\nThis story is from The Center for Public Integrity, a nonprofit, nonpartisan investigative media organization in Washington, D.C.
