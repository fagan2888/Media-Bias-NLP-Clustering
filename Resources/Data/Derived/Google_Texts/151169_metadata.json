With the cessation of driving, the study found:\n\n\n\nDiminished productivity and low participation in daily life activities outside of the home\n\n\n\nRisk of depression nearly doubled\n\n\n\n51 percent reduction in the size of social networks over a 13-year period\n\n\n\nAccelerated decline in cognitive ability over a 10-year period\n\n\n\nFive times as likely to be admitted to a long term care facility\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Its important older drivers have a plan in place that helps maintain mobility and independence once they have retired from driving,\" said Michele Harris, traffic safety consultant for AAA.\n\n\n\nCopyright 2015 by News4Jax.com.
