NEW YORK (AP) â€” NBC's "Saturday Night Live" has aired a special tribute show titled "Goodnight Sweet Prince."

"Tonight Show" host and SNL alum Jimmy Fallon hosted the episode. It featured clips of Prince performing on the comedy show over the past four decades and skits with former cast member Fred Armisen portraying the artist.

The show also included a video of Prince's impromptu performance at an after-party following the show's 40th anniversary special last year, where Prince sang "Let's Go Crazy" on a small stage alongside Fallon, fellow SNL vets Chris Rock, Maya Rudolph, Martin Short and other celebrities.

The 57-year-old music icon died Thursday at his Paisley Park compound in suburban Minneapolis. An autopsy was done Friday but no cause has been announced.

The tribute show replaced a scheduled SNL rerun.
