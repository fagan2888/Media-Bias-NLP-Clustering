LAS VEGAS (AP) - Las Vegas area authorities are investigating three separate homicides that occurred in a period of less than 24 hours.

Police located the body of 54-year-old Kevin Michael Hockar on Saturday night outside his home near Maryland Parkway and Serene Avenue.

They say he was shot and killed by a Hispanic male who fled in a maroon sedan.

North Las Vegas police found a 24-year-old man with a fatal gunshot wound at a home early Sunday.

No suspects have been identified.

A few hours later, Las Vegas police responded to an apartment complex at Mountain Vista Street and Vegas Valley Drive.

Investigators say a fight led to a man getting fatally shot.

The incidents come on the heels of a teenage boyâ€™s shooting death at a rec center Saturday morning.
