It was unclear how many would stay, with temperatures in the 40s Fahrenheit and rain forecast.\n\nSunday\u2019s demonstration was sparked by anger over the government\u2019s sudden move last week to pull out of the EU agreement and focus instead on trade ties with Russia, under strong pressure from Moscow.\n\nAfter the rally at European Square, dozens of protesters clashed with police and pro-Russia activists near the government building, while another standoff took place outside Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s office. Police said they used tear gas at the government building after protesters threw a smoke bomb and refused to back off.\n\nA larger crowd of several thousand headed for nearby Independence Square, planning to continue the protest. Meanwhile, Yanukovych supporters held their own rally on another Kiev square.\n\nThe pro-EU demonstrators, carrying giant Ukrainian and EU flags, chanted, \u201cUkraine is Europe,\u201d and sang the national anthem as they marched toward European Square for the rally.\n\n\u201cShould we go toward Europe or toward Russia? It\u2019s a choice between the past and the future,\u201d opposition leader Arseniy Yatsenyuk, a top ally of imprisoned former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, told the crowd.\n\nIn an emotional letter read to demonstrators by her daughter, Mrs. Tymoshenko called on Ukrainians to continue demonstrating until Mr. Yanukovych signs the EU deal.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t let him humiliate us all in this way,\u201d Eugenia Tymoshenko read out, shaking from cold and emotion. \u201cIt\u2019s our road map to a normal life.\u201d\n\nThe protesters responded with chants of \u201cFreedom to Yulia\u201d and \u201cDown with the gang,\u201d a reference to Mr. Yanukovych and his government.\n\nU.S. and EU officials expressed deep disappointment with Ukraine\u2019s decision, and U.S. Secretary of State John F. Kerry canceled a visit to Kiev in early December.\n\nEU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele, who has been lobbying for the deal for years, indicated Sunday that the deal is was still on the table. In a Twitter post written in English, Ukrainian and Russian, Mr. Fuele said, \u201cOur commitment to modernization of Ukraine remains firm, door remains open, benefits 4 neighbours too, despite rhetoric.\u201d\n\nOne key EU demand for signing the deal is the release of Mrs. Tymoshenko, whose imprisonment the West sees as politically driven. Mr. Yanukovych narrowly defeated Mrs. Tymoshenko in the 2010 presidential election. He comes up for re-election in 2015, and Mrs. Tymoshenko accuses him of keeping her behind bars to prevent her from running.\n\nYuri Lutsenko, a Tymoshenko ally who recently was released from jail on charges the West also called politically motivated, struck a more militant tone, asking the protesters whether they were ready to fight for their country\u2019s future.\n\n\u201cThey declared war on us,\u201d Mr. Lutsenko told the crowd. \u201cAre we ready to take on this challenge?\u201d\n\n\u2022 Associated Press writer Mark Rachkevych contributed to this article.", "article_metadata": {"description": "About 50,000 demonstrators rallied in the center of Kiev on Sunday to demand that the Ukrainian government reverse course and sign a landmark agreement with the European Union in defiance of Russia.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "About 50,000 demonstrators rallied in the center of Kiev on Sunday to demand that the Ukrainian government reverse course and sign a landmark agreement with the European Union in defiance of Russia.", "title": "Tens of thousands rally in Ukraine for closer EU ties", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/nov/24/tens-thousands-rally-ukraine-closer-eu-ties/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/11/24/aptopix-ukraine-eu-_lea.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/11/24/aptopix-ukraine-eu-_lea.jpg", "description": "About 50,000 demonstrators rallied in the center of Kiev on Sunday to demand that the Ukrainian government reverse course and sign a landmark agreement with the European Union in defiance of Russia.", "card": "summary", "title": "Tens of thousands rally in Ukraine for closer EU ties"}, "Author": "Maria Danilova", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, War Conflict, European Union, Viktor Yanukovych, Ukraine"}, "article_summary": "He comes up for re-election in 2015, and Mrs. Tymoshenko accuses him of keeping her behind bars to prevent her from running.\nIn an emotional letter read to demonstrators by her daughter, Mrs. Tymoshenko called on Ukrainians to continue demonstrating until Mr. Yanukovych signs the EU deal.\nMr. Yanukovych narrowly defeated Mrs. Tymoshenko in the 2010 presidential election.\nThe pro-EU demonstrators, carrying giant Ukrainian and EU flags, chanted, \u201cUkraine is Europe,\u201d and sang the national anthem as they marched toward European Square for the rally.\n\u201cIt\u2019s our road map to a normal life.\u201dThe protesters responded with chants of \u201cFreedom to Yulia\u201d and \u201cDown with the gang,\u201d a reference to Mr. Yanukovych and his government."}
