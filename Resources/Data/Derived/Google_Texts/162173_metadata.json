Most attempts to log in or get information about insurance options were denied Tuesday \u2014 more than a week after the Obama Administration promised the site would be working for a \"vast majority of users.\"\n\nNow some experts are worried that the federal government alienated the Hispanic community by allowing technical problems to push the launch of cuidadodesalud.gov from Oct. 1 to Dec. 6, a mere 17 days before the deadline to get covered by the beginning of the new year.\n\n\"I think there is this sense of frustration,\" says Daniel Garza, executive director of the Libre initiative.\n\n\"There\u2019s also neglect that they feel, just like on the issue of immigration. It\u2019s almost systemic how this administration has almost marginalized or shoved them to the side.\"\n\nBut new numbers from the Transamerica Center for Health Studies suggest the site's delay hasn't had any cooling effect on the Hispanic community. The organization's latest survey, released Tuesday, shows that 5 percent of Latinos have already purchased health insurance through the new exchanges, compared to just 1 percent of the white population.\n\nHector de la Torre, executive director of the Transamerica Center for Health Studies offered that many Latinos will wait until the last minute to sign up.\n\n\"Having grown up in a Mexican-American household, we're not very good at RSVP'ing and doing things ahead of time,\" quipped Hector de la Torre.\n\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid pledged in a January statement to \"ramp up our promotional efforts to drive Spanish speakers to CuidadoDeSalud.gov.\"\n\nFollow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatino\n\nLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino\n\nPeter Doocy is currently a Washington-based correspondent for FOX News Channel (FNC).
