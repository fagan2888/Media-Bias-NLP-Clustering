But results from a study led by researchers at the Yale School of Public Health suggest group prenatal care can reduce these disparities and improve health outcomes.\n\nWith group prenatal care, women were 33 percent less likely to deliver babies who were small for their gestational age when compared to women who received individual care. These women also had a lower risk of preterm and low birth weight. Attending group prenatal care sessions were also associated with fewer days in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). The more group sessions the women attended, the less likely they were to have an adverse birth outcome, to become pregnant again soon after giving birth, or to catch an STD.\n\n\"Few clinical interventions have had an impact on birth outcomes,\" said Jeannette R. Ickovics, lead author of the study, in a statement. \"Group prenatal care is related to improved health outcomes for mothers and babies, without adding risk. If scaled nationally, group prenatal care could lead to significant improvements in birth outcomes, health disparities, and health care costs.\u201d\n\nFor the study, researchers conducted a multisite randomized controlled trial in 14 health centers throughout New York City. In all, the study involved more than 1,000 pregnant women aged 14 to 21 who were less than 24 weeks pregnant, and whose pregnancies were not considered high risk. They were placed in groups of eight to 12 women who were of the same gestational age, and who had a clinical and medical assistant tending to them. Each group attended 10 two-hour sessions, which followed clinical guidelines from the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.\n\nIn 2013, black and Latino infants had 16 and 11 percent higher respective preterm birth rates when compared to white infants, according to the March of Dimes. The current study\u2019s findings could help to mitigate these persistent racial and ethnic disparities in birth and sexual health outcomes, although more research is needed to identify why group sessions were more effective.\n\n\u201cIs it additional time afforded for education and skills building in groups, opportunity for social support, or inclusion of self-care that relates to outcomes observed?\u201d the researchers asked. Maybe soon, they\u2019ll find out.\n\nSource: Ickovics J, Earnshaw V, Lewis J, et al.
