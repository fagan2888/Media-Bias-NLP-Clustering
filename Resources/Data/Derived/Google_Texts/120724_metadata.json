According to The Verge, adding a female character would have \u201cdoubled the work,\u201d for developers.\n\n\u201cIt was on our feature list until not too long ago, but it\u2019s a question of focus and production,\u201d Ubisoft\u2019s technical director James Therien explained to VideoGamer.\n\n\u201cSo we wanted to make sure we had the best experience for the character. A female character means that you have to redo a lot of animation, a lot of costumes [inaudible],\u201d Therien continued, in the interview with VideoGamer. \u201cIt would have doubled the work on those things. And I mean it\u2019s something the team really wanted, but we had to make a decision \u2026 It\u2019s unfortunate, but it\u2019s a reality of game development.\u201d\n\nA similar excuse was given to Polygon by Ubisoft creative director Alex Amancio.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s double the animations, it\u2019s double the voices, all that stuff and double the visual assets,\u201d Amancio told Polygon. \u201cEspecially because we have customizable assassins. It was really a lot of extra production work.\u201d\n\n\u201cAssassin\u2019s Creed: Unity,\u201d which takes place during the French Revolution through the Napoleonic wars, is a four-player co-0p, explained by Amancio here. Players can customize their gear, but always see themselves as the main character, Arno Dorian.\n\n\u201cBecause of that, the common denominator was Arno,\u201d Amancio explained. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we could cut our main character, so the only logical option, the only option we had, was to cut the female avatar.\u201d\n\nUbisoft designer Bruno St. Andre also told Polygon that they would need around 8,000 new animations.\n\n\u201cWe started, but we had to drop it,\u201d St. Andre said to Polygon. \u201cI cannot speak for the future of the brand, but it was dear to the production team, so you can expect that it will happen eventually in the brand.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ubisoft dropped plans to add female character in new game, \"Assassin's Creed: Unity\"", "author": "Sarah Gray", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Ubisoft dropped plans to add female character in new game, \"Assassin's Creed: Unity\"", "title": "Video game developer: Adding female characters would have \u201cdoubled the work\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/11/video_game_creator_adding_female_characters_would_have_doubled_the_work/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/Screen-Shot-2014-06-11-at-10.41.58-AM.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ubisoft dropped plans to add female character in new game, \"Assassin's Creed: Unity\"", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/Screen-Shot-2014-06-11-at-10.41.58-AM.png", "title": "Video game developer: Adding female characters would have \u201cdoubled the work\u201d", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Video game developer: Adding female characters would have \u201cdoubled the work\u201d", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, assassin's creed, E3, gamers, Sexism, video game, women in tech", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfda1\"", "article_summary": "According to The Verge, adding a female character would have \u201cdoubled the work,\u201d for developers.\nTopics: assassin's creed, E3, gamers, Sexism, video game, women in tech, Innovation News, Technology News, Life NewsThere will be no option to play a female characters in game developer Ubisoft\u2019s next installment of \u201cAssassin\u2019s Creed.\u201d Why?\nA female character means that you have to redo a lot of animation, a lot of costumes [inaudible],\u201d Therien continued, in the interview with VideoGamer.\n\u201cIt\u2019s double the animations, it\u2019s double the voices, all that stuff and double the visual assets,\u201d Amancio told Polygon.\n\u201cIt was on our feature list until not too long ago, but it\u2019s a question of focus and production,\u201d Ubisoft\u2019s technical director James Therien explained to VideoGamer."}
