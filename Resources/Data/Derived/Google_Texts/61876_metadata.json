The number of Ohioans on Medicaid, but with no other insurance, increased by an estimated 200,948 in 2014.\n\nLast year marked the beginning of expanded Medicaid coverage pushed through by Republican Gov. John Kasich, allowing people earning up to 138 percent of the poverty level to receive coverage.\n\nThe expanded coverage became available under the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, but many states with Republican leadership declined to participate.\n\nThe Kasich administration estimated at the time that up to half the newly qualified people held jobs that didn't provide health plans. The new estimates show more people, both working and not working, are now insured.\n\nThe uninsured rate for working Ohioans dropped from 12.4 percent in 2013 to 7.8 percent in 2014, the Census Bureau estimates.\n\nFor unemployed people looking for work, the uninsured rate dropped from 37.4 percent to 28.5 percent. And the uninsured rate for people not in the labor force dropped from 9.7 percent to 6.9 percent.\n\nThe number of Ohioans with private health insurance also increased, though not as sharply, with an additional 67,000 insured last year over 2013. There were increases for both people receiving health insurance from their employer and among those buying insurance on their own, the estimates said.\n\nNationally, insurance coverage for people with private plans increased in 36 states, and decreased only in Massachusetts.\n\nThe number of people with public health insurance increased in 36 states. There was no statistically significant increase or decrease in the others, the Census Bureau said in announcing the findings. Public health insurance includes Medicaid or Medicare.\n\nAnother group that has seen a sharp increase in coverage is young adults. The Affordable Care Act allowed young adults to stay on their parents' coverage through the age of 26, Previously, most lost coverage under their parents plans by the time they graduated from college or moved away from home.\n\nThe estimates for 2014 say 147,972 Ohioans ages 18 to 24 were uninsured, down from 268,725 in 2010.\n\nHere's a snapshot for uninsured rates in the Cleveland and Akron metro areas:\n\nAkron metro area (Summit and Portage counties)\n\nOverall: 7.6 percent.\n\nChildren: 4.3 percent.\n\nAge 18 to 64: 10.6 percent.\n\nAge 65 and older: 0.1 percent.\n\nWhite: 6.7 percent.\n\nBlack: 12.1 percent.\n\nLess than high school graduate: 12.9 percent.\n\nHigh school graduate: 10.8 percent.\n\nSome college: 7.8 percent.\n\nCollege graduate: 4.1 percent.\n\nFull-time worker: 6.3 percent.\n\nPart-time worker: 12.5 percent.\n\nCleveland metro area (Cuyahoga, Geauga, Lake, Lorain and Medina counties)\n\nOverall: 7.6 percent.\n\nChildren: 3.2 percent.\n\nAge 18 to 64: 11 percent.\n\nAge 65 and older: 0.6 percent.\n\nWhite: 6.7 percent.\n\nBlack: 10.4 percent.\n\nLess than high school graduate: 15.7 percent.\n\nHigh school graduate: 10.1 percent.\n\nSome college: 7.8 percent.\n\nCollege graduate: 3.2 percent.\n\nFull-time worker: 6.9 percent.\n\nPart-time worker: 13.2 percent.\n\nRich Exner, data analysis editor for the Northeast Ohio Media Group, writes about numbers on a variety of topics.
