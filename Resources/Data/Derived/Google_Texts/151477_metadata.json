Sure, when we are asked why we made a certain decision, we can usually come up with a serviceable explanation, but in most cases that explanation \u2014 that \u201creason why\u201d \u2014 was formed after the decision was made. Not before.\n\nThis is certainly true in politics and is especially true in primary politics, when voters are choosing between a set of candidates that all track relatively close to their ideological positioning. Supporters of Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and Donald Trump are all able to identify what they would describe as major differences between their preferred candidate and their respective opponents, but in many cases those differences were identified after they had been pushed in one direction or another at an affective, non-conscious level.\n\nOnce our brain has been pushed in one direction or another, we will attempt to justify that direction. This is most readily observed in split-brain patients. As Harvard psychologist Fiery Cushman explained:\n\nNeuroscientists have devised clever experiments in which information is provided to the right hemisphere (for instance, pictures of naked people), causing a change in behavior (embarrassed giggling). Split-brain individuals are then asked to explain their behavior verbally, which relies on the left hemisphere. Realizing that their body is laughing, but unaware of the nude images, the left hemisphere will confabulate an excuse for the body\u2019s behavior (\u201cI keep laughing because you ask such funny questions, Doc!\u201d).\n\nCase in point:\n\nTrump voter on Fox News says he likes that Trump doesn\u2019t give specific policy ideas because otherwise other candidates might steal them. \u2014 Elise Foley (@elisefoley) March 2, 2016\n\nNo, the Trump voter in question hasn\u2019t had brain surgery, but this is still some next-level confabulation. The same basic process is taking place. The voter has engaged in a behavior (supporting Trump) and now has to fish for a justification of their position (he has a secret plan to fight ISIS, perhaps). The reason they came up with is obviously bogus, as plenty of candidates have adopted Trump\u2019s positions on issues ranging from the Great Wall of Texas to Syrian refugees and Trump has called them out for it \u2014 \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t even be talking about immigration if it weren\u2019t for me\u201d \u2014 to his benefit. But that doesn\u2019t matter. He\u2019s their candidate, and they\u2019re sticking to him.\n\nIn cognitive terms, this is less expensive. Confirming existing beliefs is easy; changing them is hard. That\u2019s why people faced with disconfirming information regarding a political opinion will work to discredit or rationalize the information rather than incorporate it into a new opinion. That\u2019s why when you show Trump supporters attacks on Trump, it makes them like him more, not less.\n\nWe all do this to a certain degree, but it\u2019s especially interesting to watch Trump\u2019s voters do it because he gives them so much latitude. Politicians are intentionally vague so as to avoid alienating specific voters who have specific concerns, but Trump is so vague \u2014 he will make us \u201cwin again\u201d on trade (how?), he will build infrastructure (besides the wall?) and he will replace Obamacare with \u201csomething terrific;\u201d and he\u2019ll do it all with \u201cgood management\u201d \u2014 that he gives voters tons of room to fill in the blanks for themselves.\n\nEven when the blanks they have to fill are the blanks in Trump\u2019s platform.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "2016, cognition, confabulate, Donald Trump, Elections, split brain", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "AMERICAblog News", "description": "Trump's vagueness lets his supporters come up with their own reasons for supporting him.", "title": "Confabulators for Trump - AMERICAblog News", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1464, "identifier": "http://americablog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-28-at-10.25.48-AM.png", "height": 840}, "updated_time": "2016-03-02T22:05:46-04:00", "url": "http://americablog.com/2016/03/confabulators-for-trump.html", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Trump's vagueness lets his supporters come up with their own reasons for supporting him.", "creator": "@_Jon_Green", "image": "http://americablog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-28-at-10.25.48-AM.png", "title": "Confabulators for Trump - AMERICAblog News", "site": "@americablog", "card": "summary"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "6a65cadbb06b6a8cd2795a412c36d6b4"}, "fb": {"admins": 504024627}, "google-site-verification": "LrdwJVMR_suty6YsOZ4xc1Hv3-F8Ms0Wo-VhCAoXm_U", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/AMERICAblog", "section": "Elections", "tag": "split brain", "published_time": "2016-03-02T13:51:20-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-02T22:05:46-04:00"}}, "article_summary": "That\u2019s why when you show Trump supporters attacks on Trump, it makes them like him more, not less.\n\u2014 Elise Foley (@elisefoley) March 2, 2016No, the Trump voter in question hasn\u2019t had brain surgery, but this is still some next-level confabulation.\nPoliticians are intentionally vague so as to avoid alienating specific voters who have specific concerns, but Trump is so vague \u2014 he will make us \u201cwin again\u201d on trade (how?\nCase in point:Trump voter on Fox News says he likes that Trump doesn\u2019t give specific policy ideas because otherwise other candidates might steal them.\nWe all do this to a certain degree, but it\u2019s especially interesting to watch Trump\u2019s voters do it because he gives them so much latitude."}
