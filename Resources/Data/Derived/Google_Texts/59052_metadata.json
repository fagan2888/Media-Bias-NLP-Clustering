Unions gave ProgressOhio $134,500 in 2012, $97,000 in 2011 and $136,450 in 2010.\n\nRegular union contributors to ProgressOhio include UAW Region 2B, Ohio Education Association and Service Employees International Union District 1199.\n\nRothenberg has been paid a six-figure salary to help ProgressOhio \u201cprovide a progressive voice for Ohio\u2019s citizens\u201d and \u201cinform and education the public about progressive ideals,\u201d based on the 501(c)(4) nonprofit\u2019s annual disclosures to the IRS.\n\nRothenberg was paid $113,116 in 2012, $110,124 in 2011 and $107,730 in 2010.\n\nLabor union influence of ProgressOhio goes further than donations and payments for research and other consulting services. As of 2012, more than a third of the 16 members on ProgressOhio\u2019s board of directors were union officials:\n\nAmerican Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Council 8 political and legislative director Robert Davis\n\nOEA vice president Bill Leibensperger\n\nUAW Region 2B director Ken Lortz\n\nOhio Civil Service Employees Association (AFSCME Local 11) president Chris Mabe\n\nSEIU District 1199 public affairs director Monica Moran\n\nOhio AFL-CIO secretary-treasurer Pierette Talley\n\nIn October, ProgressOhio Education Fund announced its annual \u201cProgressive Hero\u201d award will be presented Nov. 17 to former UAW president Bob King. At the ceremony held at UAW 2B headquarters in Maumee, ProgressOhio will honor King \u201cfor all his work but especially his role in saving the American auto industry thus benefiting all Ohioans.\u201d\n\nPast Progressive Hero events have been generously supported by the labor unions represented on ProgressOhio\u2019s board of directors.\n\nDuring ProgressOhio\u2019s search for Rothenberg\u2019s replacement, former Cleveland Plain Dealer statehouse bureau chief Sandy Theis will serve as interim director, the group announced Nov. 4.\n\n\u201cThe mission of ProgressOhio will remain largely the same, but I hope the increased number of fiscal conservatives elected to the General Assembly will join with ProgressOhio, StudentsFirst, Fordham and others who are deeply concerned that too many charter schools are wasting millions of dollars and hurting thousands of kids each year,\u201d Theis said in an email to Ohio Watchdog.\n\n\u201cI hope this is one of those no-brainers that can unite the two parties,\u201d she added.\n\nProgressOhio and donor OEA have both pushed for increased regulation of charter schools \u2014 focusing in particular on charters run by Concept Schools, a business under state and federal investigation. Framing unionized public school districts\u2019 shortcomings as evidence they need more funding, ProgressOhio and OEA are highly critical of school choice programs redirecting state funds to non-union charter schools.\n\nRothenberg\u2019s move to Detroit coincides with a leadership change at the Ohio Democratic Party, where Rothenberg was communications director prior to joining ProgressOhio. ODP chair Chris Redfern is stepping down in mid-December.\n\nRothenberg has been executive director of ProgressOhio since the state affiliate of national leftist advocacy network ProgressNow was launched in 2006. Redfern has led ODP since 2005.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Brian Rothenberg is leaving his leadership role at activist group ProgressOhio for a position with United Auto Workers, one of ProgressOhio's union donors.", "og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Brian Rothenberg is leaving his leadership role at activist group ProgressOhio for a position with United Auto Workers, one of ProgressOhio's union donors.", "title": "ProgressOhio leader leaving for United Auto Workers job - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/11/uaw-logo-300px.gif", "updated_time": "2016-05-10T11:05:57+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/182066/progressohio-leader-uaw/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Brian Rothenberg is leaving his leadership role at activist group ProgressOhio for a position with United Auto Workers, one of ProgressOhio's union donors.", "title": "ProgressOhio leader leaving for United Auto Workers job - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/11/uaw-logo-300px.gif"}, "creator": "@jasonahart", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Labor", "tag": "united auto workers", "published_time": "2014-11-07T10:52:06+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-10T11:05:57+00:00"}, "news_keywords": "ProgressOhio, United Auto Workers, Brian Rothenberg, Sandi Theis, Ohio Education Association, Service Employees International Union, SEIU District 1199, UAW Region 2B, Bob King"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcc06\"", "article_summary": "Brian Rothenberg is leaving his leadership role at activist group ProgressOhio for a position with United Auto Workers, one of ProgressOhio\u2019s many union donors.\nUnions reported payments totaling $122,500 to ProgressOhio and sister nonprofit ProgressOhio Education in their fiscal 2013 reports to the U.S. Department of Labor.\nLabor union influence of ProgressOhio goes further than donations and payments for research and other consulting services.\nRegular union contributors to ProgressOhio include UAW Region 2B, Ohio Education Association and Service Employees International Union District 1199.\nAs a senior communications adviser for UAW, Rothenberg will be directly paid by a labor union, after several years of getting paid by labor unions indirectly."}
