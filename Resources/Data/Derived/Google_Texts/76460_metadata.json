Yet even a cursory examination of their positions reveals they\u2019re not defending the free market, but attempting to protect the fossil fuel industry from competition.\n\nA top target has been a wind energy tax incentive known as the production tax credit (PTC). These groups peddle the false claim that the PTC distorts the free market and tilts the playing field unfairly for wind.\n\nThe fatal flaw in their argument is that all energy is subsidized, and while these shills are indignantly protesting the PTC, they remain silent about the many goodies being showered on coal, oil and natural gas\u2014which are greater than what the PTC provides to wind energy.\n\nBy advocating an end to the PTC, these groups are not seeking to create a level playing field, they are working to maintain a skewed one and keep the market rigged in favor of coal and gas.\n\nIf eliminating federal subsidies and letting the market drive energy choices was their true goal, those crusading against the wind PTC would be working just as hard to eliminate fossil fuel subsidies. They\u2019re not.\n\nThe same bias is trumping free market principles in their attacks on solar energy.\n\nPeople who install solar arrays on their homes or businesses make use of something called net metering. Net metering allows owners of solar panels to sell the energy they produce to the utilities. This prevents energy from being wasted and provides a fair return for the investment in solar panels, allowing individuals to be more energy self-sufficient.\n\nThese benefits from net metering sound like a good thing for the free market and liberty, right? Barry Goldwater Jr. thinks so, as do the Christian Coalition, various tea party groups, Conservatives for Energy Freedom, and Conservatives for Responsible Stewardship. But not AFP or ALEC, both groups are relentlessly attacking net metering across the country.\n\nDue to the efforts of ALEC, AFP and some utilities, legislation has been introduced in 21 states to either make net metering illegal or penalize solar owners with fees and regulations. Keep in mind that these are the same groups who oppose any kind of regulation or fees on fossil fuel interests.\n\nThese groups seek to bolster certain federal subsidies by attacking others, rig the market in the name of preserving it, pick winners and losers under the pretense of opposing such things, stifle freedom while pretending to promote it, and encourage waste and inefficiency. All of this while pretending to be conservative and support free market principles.\n\nThis special interest hijacking of the conservative label comes at the expense of real conservative values\u2014and our nation\u2019s long-term energy security.\n\nAs President Reagan liked to say \u201cfacts are stubborn things.\u201d Despite the efforts of Koch surrogates to undermine wind and solar, these renewable sources of energy are gaining market share at a record pace\u2014which is the real reason behind this war on renewable energy.\n\nWhy are utilities adding so much wind and solar? Because diversifying their fuel mix with wind and solar helps keep their fuel costs down, their electricity rates more stable, and the grid more reliable.\n\nThere is no conservative creed that argues against such diversification and in favor remaining overly dependent on finite fossil fuels. Only the imprudent whims of short-sighted special interests would take America down that path.\n\nIt\u2019s time for genuine and principled conservatives to defend conservatism from this misappropriation.\n\nA good start is to challenge the Koch-sponsored war on renewables and advance a fact-based, prudent, and truly conservative energy policy that is in long-term the best interest of all Americans\u2014not just the narrow interests of a few.\n\n\n\nJenkins is president of Conservatives for Responsible Stewardship", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "These shills protesting the PTC remain silent about the many goodies being showered on coal, oil and natural gas\u2014which are greater than what the PTC provides to wind energy.", "description": "These shills protesting the PTC remain silent about the many goodies being showered on coal, oil and natural gas\u2014which are greater than what the PTC provides to wind energy.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Congress Blog"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "These shills protesting the PTC remain silent about the many goodies being showered on coal, oil and natural gas\u2014which are greater than what the PTC provides to wind energy.", "title": "Conservatism hijacked for war on renewables", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/energy-environment/252010-conservatism-hijacked-for-war-on-renewables", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T05:25-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/energy-environment/252010-conservatism-hijacked-for-war-on-renewables", "dcterms.date": "2015-08-28T14:00-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Joe Picard", "author": "David Jenkins", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-28T14:00:03-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/energy-environment/252010-conservatism-hijacked-for-war-on-renewables", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "These shills protesting the PTC remain silent about the many goodies being showered on coal, oil and natural gas\u2014which are greater than what the PTC provides to wind energy.", "card": "summary", "title": "Conservatism hijacked for war on renewables"}, "dcterms.title": "Conservatism hijacked for war on renewables"}, "article_summary": "There is a war on energy being waged, but the target is not coal, it is renewable energy, namely wind and solar.\nYet even a cursory examination of their positions reveals they\u2019re not defending the free market, but attempting to protect the fossil fuel industry from competition.\nThese benefits from net metering sound like a good thing for the free market and liberty, right?\nA top target has been a wind energy tax incentive known as the production tax credit (PTC).\nThe same bias is trumping free market principles in their attacks on solar energy."}
