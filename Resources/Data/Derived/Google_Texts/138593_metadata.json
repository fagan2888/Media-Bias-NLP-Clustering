The harm done by HB2 to North Carolinians cannot be rectified by mere tweaks to this anti-LGBT and anti-worker law. HB 2 must be repealed outright.\n\nHouse Bill 2 is part of a broader assault on the constitutional rights of communities across North Carolina to equal protection under the law.\n\nSince the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act in 2013, removing North Carolina voting changes from federal oversight, the state has been a leader in pushing through laws intended to disenfranchise minority voters.\n\nIn North Carolina, tens of thousands of voters have been disenfranchised or burdened by voter suppression laws and the inconsistent implementation of them across the state.\n\nGiven these assaults on voting rights, coupled with North Carolina\u2019s failures to pass the Medicaid Expansion under the Affordable Care Act or a long-overdue minimum wage increase, the passage of discriminatory House Bill 2 paints a troubling picture of a state legislature that is attacking the rights of vulnerable communities from all angles.\n\nFor centuries, those seeking to deny civil rights to others have used the same religious freedom arguments we hear today.\n\nFreedom of religion is a fundamental American value. That\u2019s why religious freedom is so strongly protected in the First Amendment and the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA). Many states have religious freedom laws that mirror the federal RFRA. But more recent religious freedom bills are going beyond the intended shield of protection for religious minorities and using religion as a sword to attack minority communities. As more and more bills arise across the country aimed at singling out LGBT people for harm under the guise of religion, it\u2019s important to understand the long and ruinous history of this deplorable tactic.\n\nDating back to the times of slavery, religious exemption rhetoric and legal arguments have been used to stymy civil rights to many communities. Claims of religious freedom have been used to justify support for segregation and discrimination against immigrants, women, and people with disabilities, and have even endangered religious minorities that the original Religious Freedom Restoration Act set out to protect.\n\nA new report out from The Leadership Conference Education Fund, Striking a Balance, details the history behind the legal and rhetorical religious arguments used to subvert the rights of minority communities and provides groundbreaking insight into the ways these arguments are still being used today.\n\nHouse Bill 2 is a dangerous step in the wrong direction for North Carolina. Tinkering with the language to appear more moderate is insufficient to protect North Carolinians. HB 2 must be repealed immediately.\n\nFor more information, please contact Scott Simpson with The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights (simpson@civilrights.org/202-466-2061).", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.civilrights.org/press/2016/memo-north-carolina-hb2.html", "site_name": "The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights", "image": "http://www.civilrights.org/about/leadershipconf_foraboutus2.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Memo: North Carolina Executive Order is Not Enough, Anti-LGBT and Anti-Worker Law Should be Repealed"}, "google-site-verification": "MZqmxaaLtHrtdDTgIy05HoURMLj_17JgG3kZvNcjzkI", "fb": {"admins": 586003167, "app_id": 143697325675837}, "verify-v1": "yx24KLK9Z91PlNBYDVG+GR0/FEa8WnlL6vU6rboKHLI=", "generator": "Convio CMS"}, "article_summary": "That\u2019s why religious freedom is so strongly protected in the First Amendment and the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA).\nIn North Carolina, tens of thousands of voters have been disenfranchised or burdened by voter suppression laws and the inconsistent implementation of them across the state.\nHouse Bill 2 is part of a broader assault on the constitutional rights of communities across North Carolina to equal protection under the law.\nThe harm done by HB2 to North Carolinians cannot be rectified by mere tweaks to this anti-LGBT and anti-worker law.\nFor centuries, those seeking to deny civil rights to others have used the same religious freedom arguments we hear today."}
