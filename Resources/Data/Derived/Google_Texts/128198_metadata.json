Another 28 percent pick President George W. Bush. Ronald Reagan is the best president since WWII, 35 percent of voters say, with 18 percent for Bill Clinton, 15 percent for John F. Kennedy and 8 percent for Obama, the independent Quinnipiac (KWIN-uh-pe-ack) University poll finds. Among Democrats, 34 percent say Clinton is the best president, with 18 percent each for Obama and Kennedy. Obama has been a better president than George W. Bush, 39 percent of voters say, while 40 percent say he is worse. Men say 43 \u2013 36 percent that Obama is worse than Bush while women say 42 \u2013 38 percent he is better. Obama is worse, Republicans say 79 \u2013 7 percent and independent voters say 41 \u2013 31 percent. Democrats say 78 \u2013 4 percent that he is better. Voters say by a narrow 37 \u2013 34 percent that Obama is better for the economy than Bush. America would be better off if Republican Mitt Romney had won the 2012 presidential election, 45 percent of voters say, while 38 percent say the country would be worse off. Missing Mitt are Republicans 84 \u2013 5 percent and independent voters 47 \u2013 33 percent, while Democrats say 74 \u2013 10 percent that the U.S. would be worse off with Romney.\n\nPolls are often a quick way to manufacture news, and they\u2019re used as much to manipulate public opinion as measure it, but this particular survey isn\u2019t the sort of thing media organizations are going to relish putting in headlines and inviting liberal guests to discuss. I\u2019ve always been a bit suspicious of these \u201cbest and worst presidents in history\u201d rankings, because they\u2019re more of a lens for magnifying partisan passions than a dispassionate critique of performance. That would explain how President Obama ends up as both the absolute worst, and the fourth-best, postwar president in the same poll.\n\nThere\u2019s also going to be a heavy bias toward recent memory \u2013 would the respondents for this poll care to sit for follow-up questions in which they discuss the best and worst policy decisions of the Eisenhower Administration? \u2013 and toward media mythology, which is why a large number of people who could not accurately describe a single thing President John F. Kennedy did will assure you he was the best President ever, the luminous ideal for every chief executive to come after stovepipe hats went out of fashion.\n\nSo what this is all really saying is that Obama\u2019s disapproval rating among everyone who isn\u2019t a passionate Democrat partisan is hitting rock bottom, and the passionate partisans aren\u2019t feeling very energetic about defending him at the moment. This isn\u2019t the first poll to show strong buyer\u2019s remorse for Mitt Romney, who is probably benefiting from the impression that he\u2019s competent, while even Obama supporters are having a hard time making that claim for their man with a straight face:\n\nAmerica would be better off if Republican Mitt Romney had won the 2012 presidential election, 45 percent of voters say, while 38 percent say the country would be worse off. Missing Mitt are Republicans 84 \u2013 5 percent and independent voters 47 \u2013 33 percent, while Democrats say 74 \u2013 10 percent that the U.S. would be worse off with Romney. \u201cOver the span of 69 years of American history and 12 presidencies, President Barack Obama finds himself with President George W. Bush at the bottom of the popularity barrel,\u201d said Tim Malloy, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll. \u201cWould Mitt have been a better fit? More voters in hindsight say yes.\u201d American voters say 54 \u2013 44 percent that the Obama Administration is not competent running the government. The president is paying attention to what his administration is doing, 47 percent say, while 48 percent say he does not pay enough attention.\n\nOf course, as we should all remember from the 2012 exit polls, that election had almost nothing to do with competence. It was all about empathy, the perception that Obama understood and cared for the Sainted Middle Class more than Baron Harkonnen did. How\u2019s that working out for everyone?\n\nAnother interesting thing about this poll, and other recent surveys with similar results, is how a fairly modest shift in crucial demographics can produce tectonic poll movement for those who depend upon identity politics:\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s job approval rating, inching up since a negative 38 \u2013 57 percent in December, 2013, his all-time low, is stalled at a negative 40 \u2013 53 percent. This compares to the president\u2019s negative 42 \u2013 50 percent job approval in an April 2 national survey. Today, the president gets negative scores of 10 \u2013 88 percent from Republicans, 31 \u2013 59 percent from independent voters, 37 \u2013 57 percent from men and 42 \u2013 49 percent from women. Democrats approve 79 \u2013 13 percent. The president gets mixed grades for character as voters say 48 \u2013 48 percent that he is honest and trustworthy and 51 \u2013 47 percent that he cares about their needs and problems. He gets a negative 47 \u2013 51 percent for leadership qualities. The economy and jobs are the most important problems facing the country today, 35 percent of voters say, with 12 percent listing politicians/campaigns/corruption, 6 percent each for healthcare and foreign affairs, 5 percent for the budget and 4 percent each for education and immigration.\n\nIndies and men didn\u2019t support him all that much in 2012, either. Women disapproving 42-49 is the crushing blow. Also, notice how the Number One issue for the Ruling Class, immigration reform, chugs in with a measly 4 percent among actual Americans. Politicians and corruption climbing into second place isn\u2019t happy news for the people who think the State should run everything, especially if Republicans can do a good job of hammering the essential point that Big Government and Honest Government are fundamentally incompatible concepts.\n\nThat\u2019s a bit \u201cif,\u201d but as a snapshot of the evolving national discussion, a major poll showing people writing off Obama as the worst President in seven decades is interesting. His numbers will perk up after he\u2019s gone, just as President Bush\u2019s dismal numbers are shifting; time heals political wounds. As I\u2019m sure Mr. Bush would attest, that\u2019s not much comfort in the days after a grim midterm election defeat. I don\u2019t suppose a spirited debate over whether Obama is more unpopular than Bush, or vice versa, is something either man\u2019s supporters would relish\u2026 but it\u2019s bound to be a more unpleasant discussion for those who line up behind the man that\u2019s still in office.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Human Events", "description": "Hey, maybe competence is more desirable in a President than empathy, after all!", "title": "Poll says Obama worst president in 70 years, respondents wish they had chosen Romney instead | Human Events", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://humanevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/obamacare_cbo-480x360.jpg", "url": "http://humanevents.com/2014/07/02/poll-says-obama-worst-president-in-70-years-respondents-wish-they-had-chosen-romney-instead/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"pages": 212436860202}, "description": "Hey, maybe competence is more desirable in a President than empathy, after all!", "twitter": {"site": "@humanevents", "image": "http://humanevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/obamacare_cbo-480x360.jpg", "description": "Hey, maybe competence is more desirable in a President than empathy, after all!", "card": "summary", "creator": "@@Doc_0"}}, "article_summary": "That would explain how President Obama ends up as both the absolute worst, and the fourth-best, postwar president in the same poll.\nObama has been a better president than George W.
