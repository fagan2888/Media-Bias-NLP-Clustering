Mr. Curry, two-word answer only.\"\n\nCurry replied, \"I will work with the next sheriff. It's critically important\u2014\" before Ogden cut in, \"Not the question. I'm sorry. We're going to keep this on focus tonight. You're not going to say who you'll vote for?\"\n\nBrown similarly dodged the question with the reply, \"Well, I'm going to make sure that, at the end of the day, that I'm going to work with whomever becomes the next sheriff.\u201d\n\nOgden said, \"All right, my math is bad, but it was just two-word answers, so hopefully we'll be a little more forthcoming throughout the evening.\u201d\n\nIt didn\u2019t seem to help, however, as both candidates continued to duck and weave around some of the more sensitive issues. Brown, for instance, did not say whether he would support expanding the city\u2019s human rights ordinance to protect members of Jacksonville\u2019s LGBT community from discrimination. Or whether he supports the Affordable Care Act, known as ObamaCare.\n\nCurry did not answer whether he knows any families living on minimum wage nor what steps he would take to prove to Jacksonville residents he'll listen to points of view other than the Republican Party's. Curry served as state GOP chairman until recently.\n\nThroughout the evening, Curry stuck to a theme that Brown fails to take responsibility for shortcomings, including the city's Police and Fire Pension meltdown and lopsided budgets.\n\nEach candidate was given the chance to ask the other a question.\n\nBrown highlighted Northeast Florida's economic growth, asking Curry how he can say Jacksonville is worse off than it was four years ago with thousands of new jobs. Curry responded that job growth has been only in certain parts of town, while entire communities have been left out.\n\nCurry asked Brown, \"Do you think I'm a racist?\" in response to a Brown campaign mailer implying Curry suppressed black people's votes as GOP chairman by fighting for shortened early-voting days. Brown defended the mailer, saying he believes a Curry mayorship would \"turn back the clock\" because Curry opposes raising the minimum wage and equal pay for women.\n\nAs soon as the cameras stopped rolling, the two candidates argued about negative attack ads and who was running more personal attacks.\n\nThe third and final mayoral debate is Thursday night at Jacksonville University. It\u2019s sponsored by WJXT and JU\u2019s Public Policy Institute.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics", "description": "Democratic incumbent mayor Alvin Brown and Republican mayoral challenger Lenny Curry went head to head Monday night in the second of three candidate", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://news.wjct.org/post/face-face-brown-curry-tackle-racism-economic-growth-mayoral-debate", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wjct/files/styles/medium/public/201505/browncurry_0.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Democratic incumbent mayor Alvin Brown and Republican mayoral challenger Lenny Curry went head to head Monday night in the second of three candidate", "title": "'Face To Face,' Brown, Curry Tackle Racism, Economic Growth In Mayoral Debate"}, "story_id": 406156927, "twitter": {"site": "@WJCTJax", "card": "summary", "creator": "@JessicaPubRadio"}, "author": "Jessica Palombo, Cyd Hoskinson", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "&#039;Face To Face,&#039; Brown, Curry Tackle Racism, Economic Growth In Mayoral Debate"}, "nid": 21637, "datePublished": "2015-05-12", "keywords": "jacksonville mayor\\'s race, Alvin Brown, Lenny Curry, 2015 Jacksonville City Elections, 2015 Mayor\\'s Race", "wordCount": 504, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Brown highlighted Northeast Florida's economic growth, asking Curry how he can say Jacksonville is worse off than it was four years ago with thousands of new jobs.\nCurry responded that job growth has been only in certain parts of town, while entire communities have been left out.\nin response to a Brown campaign mailer implying Curry suppressed black people's votes as GOP chairman by fighting for shortened early-voting days.\nBrown defended the mailer, saying he believes a Curry mayorship would \"turn back the clock\" because Curry opposes raising the minimum wage and equal pay for women.\nCurry asked Brown, \"Do you think I'm a racist?\""}
