The Newberry County Sheriff's Office said a State of Emergency was declared for the county on Sunday afternoon.

Sheriff Foster with the Newberry County Sheriff's Office said the Cannon Creek Bridge collapsed, causing US 176 to close down.

Foster said US 176 was closed after the bridge collapsed due to flooding. The road was closed between a two mile range of SC 219 and SC 773. Detours were in place.

Foster said the bridge was completely gone and officials saw it buckling earlier in the day and had already blocked the road before it collapsed. The bridge was built in 1949.

The Pomaria-Garmany Elementary School area was heavily flooded. Foster said officials were opening a shelter at Newberry High School.

Officials in Newberry County said some creek bridges, especially on rural roads are covered with water.

On Monday, the SC Department of Transportation reported numerous road closures in Newberry County. See the list here.

Emergency officials opened a shelter Sunday after emergency evacuations were ordered but the sheriff's office said the decision was made to close the shelter Monday morning because no one was using it.
