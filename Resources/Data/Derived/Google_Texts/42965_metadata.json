He cites three 19th-century decisions and one from 1958 in support of his thesis. Although he does not elaborate on just how the decisions he mentions nail the nullification coffin shut, even the mere insinuation that such is true (or even could be!) deserves some attention.\n\nWhere does the Supreme Court derive the power to declare the actions of the states unconstitutional? Despite mentioning Article III, Gitz is unable to point to that clause or provision of that article granting to the Supreme Court the authority to nullify nullification.\n\nSimply put, such a conception of Supreme Court power was never contemplated by the Founders.\n\nTo begin with, Thomas Jefferson specifically addressed this assumption in the Kentucky Resolution of 1798.\n\nThe principle and construction contended for that the general government is the exclusive judge of the extent of the powers delegated to it, stop nothing short of despotism since the discretion of those who administer the government, and not the constitution, would be the measure of their powers: That the several states who formed that instrument, being sovereign and independent, have the unquestionable right to judge of its infraction, and that a NULLIFICATION by those sovereignties, of all unauthorized acts done under color of that instrument, is the rightful remedy. [Emphasis in original.]\n\nHow did so many scholars, lawyers, and professors come to believe that the authority to nullify an unconstitutional act of the federal government is the exclusive prerogative of the Supreme Court? Along those same lines, how did so many otherwise intelligent people come to accede such absolute power to a small claque of black-robed oligarchs?\n\nTwo words: judicial review. From Marbury v. Madison to the Cooper v. Aaron case cited by Gitz, professors and students of law and government have been conditioned to accept that the Supreme Court is the final arbiter of all things constitutional. If that gaggle of justices decrees an act to be in conformity to the Constitution, then there is no appeal and the matter is settled for eternity.\n\nThere\u2019s are a couple of problems with this popular, easy, albeit sloppy, reasoning.\n\nFirst, as Mary Babitz of the New Jersey Tenth Amendment Center explains:\n\nIn fact, however, there is nothing in Marbury v. Madison to warrant such a supremacy, merely a statement that the Supreme Court, like any other branch of federal or state government, has the authority and duty of Constitutional review in determining whether another branch of its level, or the other level, of government has acted beyond the scope of its powers and infringed on the powers of the other.\n\nBabitz is correct. The usurpation of exclusive authority to define the boundaries of the Constitution did not occur until the decision handed down in the Cooper v. Aaron case.\n\nIn that 1958 ruling, Chief Justice Earl Warren, without any right whatsoever, decreed that Marbury v. Madison \u201cdeclared the basic principle that the federal judiciary is supreme in the exposition of the law of the Constitution,\u201d adding that judicial review \u201chas ever since been respected by this Court and the Country as a permanent and indispensable feature of our constitutional system.\u201d\n\nWell, that\u2019s decided then. Except it isn\u2019t.\n\nWhich of our founders \u2014 even among the most ardent nationalists \u2014 would a reader imagine would support as a core principle of federalism the endowment of a very small group of unelected, unaccountable, life-tenured lawyers with supreme, exclusive, and unassailable power over the Constitution?\n\nHow would anyone with even a passing appreciation for limited government and an elementary familiarity with the framing of our Constitution accept the idea of Supreme Court infallibility and concede to that robe-clad coterie power only dreamed of by King George III and every other tyrant throughout history?\n\nUnfortunately, Gitz and Americans for Limited Government not only have fallen for this ruse, but have now repeated it, a much more deadly and unforgivable sin.\n\nNext, why is it, if we accept Gitz\u2019s portrayal of Supreme Court power, that such immense power seems never have been wielded to save the people from the countless congressional acts that have not only exceeded that body\u2019s constitutionally established powers, but have robbed the people of the United States of their most cherished, fundamental liberties and burdened them with the almost unbearable financial obligation of funding these unconstitutional programs and policies?\n\nIf the Supreme Court is, as Gitz insists, the decider of all things constitutional, it is certainly doing a terrible job and have inexplicably fiddled while the Bill of Rights burned, leaving it all but unidentifiable. Surely, Gitz, the ALG, and other \u201cconservative\u201d organizations do not genuinely support such tyranny.\n\nNext, Professor Gitz argues that the so-called Supremacy Clause of Article VI of the Constitution \u201cspecifies that federal laws \u201care the supreme law of the land\u201d and therefore take precedence over state laws, meaning that in our constitutional framework Obamacare legally trumps any legislative acts from South Carolina\u2019s state government.\u201d\n\nWith all due respect, Dr. Gitz, the Supremacy Clause (as Gitz and others incorrectly label it) of Article VI does not declare that federal laws are the supreme law of the land. It states that the Constitution \"and laws of the United States made in pursuance thereof\" are the supreme law of the land.\n\nThe phrase that pays is \u201cIn pursuance thereof, not \u201cin violation thereof.\u201d If an act of Congress is not permissible under any enumerated power, it is not made in pursuance of the Constitution and therefore not only is not the supreme law of the land, it is not the law at all.\n\nAlexander Hamilton put a fine point on the matter in The Federalist, No. 33:\n\nBut it will not follow from this doctrine that acts of the larger society which are not pursuant to its constitutional powers, but which are invasions of the residuary authorities of the smaller societies, will become the supreme law of the land. These will be merely acts of usurpation, and will deserve to be treated as such. [Emphasis in original.]\n\nActs not authorized under the enumerated powers of the Constitution are \u201cmerely acts of usurpations\u201d and deserve to be disregarded, ignored, and denied any legal effect.\n\nAlthough Gitz would disagree, more state legislators need to learn this. Familiarity with this fact of constitutional construction is fundamental to a reclaiming of state authority and removing the threat to liberty posed by the centralization of power in the federal government.\n\nFinally, we address Gitz\u2019s misleading claim that James Madison \u201cdenounced \u201cnullification\u201d in no uncertain terms.\u201d In support of this misrepresentation of Madison\u2019s position, Gitz relies on a statement by Madison that has become the (cracked) foundation upon which so much opposition to modern state attempts to nullify unconstitutional acts of the federal government have been built.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s unclear from his paper whether Gitz intentionally or accidentally removes the quote from Madison from its context, putting it back will help readers reconcile Madison\u2019s allegedly contradictory statements.\n\nIn his \"Notes on Nullification,\" Madison\u2019s disapproval of nullification was not with the principle, but with the practice, specifically as was being proposed by South Carolina and John Calhoun.\n\nAnyone reading Madison\u2019s notes would notice that in several passages he refers to \u201cher\u201d doctrine of nullification, with South Carolina being the female in question. Furthermore, in other places in the notes, Madison says he is writing to resist South Carolina\u2019s \u201cpeculiar doctrine\u201d of nullification.\n\nAgain, placing Madison\u2019s statements back within their proper context would go a long way toward disabusing anyone \u2014 including Dr. Gitz \u2014 of the notion that Madison \u201cdenounced \u2018nullification\u2019 in no uncertain terms.\u201d\n\nMadison wrote his Notes on Nullification in response to inquiries being made to him specifically regarding South Carolina\u2019s efforts to invalidate a federal act and the assumption many were making that if one state nullified such an act then all states would be bound to do likewise unless a convention was called.\n\nThis equally erroneous attempted application of nullification is what prompted Madison to put pen to paper. He rightly believed that one state can nullify a federal act without requiring other states to follow suit. Furthermore, in addressing South Carolina\u2019s tack, Madison wanted to be on record as opposing a bloody civil war.\n\nFor those interested in seeing the full picture of Madison\u2019s notion of nullification, consider this statement, also taken from Madison\u2019s notes:\n\n\u201cThe right of nullification meant by Mr. Jefferson is the natural right, which all admit to be a remedy against insupportable oppression.\u201d\n\nNotice: Madison says \u201call admit\u201d that nullification is a \u201cremedy against insupportable oppression.\u201d\n\nTo the point, if Gitz genuinely believes that Madison would not support South Carolina\u2019s attempt to hold ObamaCare as \u201cnull, void, and of no legal effect,\u201d then he must also believe that Madison would not consider the health care behemoth to be an \u201cinsupportable oppression.\u201d\n\nIf ObamaCare doesn\u2019t meet Madisonian muster of an \u201cinsupportable oppression,\u201d then one would be hard pressed to find any federal act that does.\n\nUntil \u201cconservative\u201d state legislators begin informing themselves of the rights retained by the states and begin ignoring the irrational and incorrect opinions of professors and judges, there will be no end of federal demands and they will get more and more difficult to comply with and will thereby justify increasing federal control over the apparatuses of state government.\n\nThe trajectory is easy to see and follow into the future. The federal government will soon grow into a central government after the model of the so-called European democracies, one \u201cinsupportable oppression\u201d after another.\n\nJoe A.
