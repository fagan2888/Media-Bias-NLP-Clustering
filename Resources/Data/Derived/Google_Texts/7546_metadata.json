After the 2008-2009 recessions, Sayre was hit with the Federal Sequestration, which cut Medicare payments by 2 percent,\" the statement said. \"Then in 2012, CMS (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services) reduced reimbursements by 30 percent to 35 percent to Sayre for Medicare patients who can't cover their out-of-pocket expenses. In addition to these strains, the State of Oklahoma not expanding Medicaid has been detrimental to the hospital's operations.\u201d\n\nThe statement also blamed the stress on the local economy for the closure, including the shuttering of the privately run North Fork Correctional Facility in Sayre in November.\n\n\u201cLocally, the economy has recently taken a hit due to the unfortunate closure of the prison and the decline in oil and gas which also accelerated the hospitals struggles,\u201d the statement said.\n\nThe 31-bed, nonprofit community hospital ceased all operations at 3:30 p.m. Monday. Sayre, in western Oklahoma about halfway between Oklahoma City and Amarillo, Texas, has a population of about 4,400.\n\nSayre Memorial staff who answered the phone on Monday afternoon said they had been instructed by hospital staff not to talk to the media.\n\nIn 2006, voters in Sayre approved a 1-cent sales tax increase to help replace the then 46-year-old Sayre Memorial Hospital building. The $14 million capital bond issue was underwritten by Stern Brothers & Co. of St. Louis.\n\nIn a statement posted on its Facebook page, the Sayre Chamber of Commerce said the hospital was a victim of the downturn in the local economy and that the hospital bond holders forced the closure due to an inability to lower payment amounts.\n\nNo money left\n\nThe loss of oil and gas revenue in Sayre, combined with the closing of the North Fork Correctional Facility, a major employer, created a $64,000 monthly deficit in the city's budget, the Sayre Chamber of Commerce said.\n\n\u201cThe city had been making payments and keeping the hospital open by funding payroll,\u201d the Sayre chamber said. \u201cWith the huge loss of city revenue, there is no money left to give.\u201d\n\nSayre City Manager Guy Hylton declined to comment on the closure.\n\nCraig W. Jones, president of the Oklahoma Hospital Association, said in a statement that the hospital closure is a \u201ctremendous loss for the community\u201d\n\n\u201cHospitals across the state, as they are across the nation, are struggling due to cuts in reimbursements, such as Medicare and Medicaid, difficulties recruiting physicians, the rising cost of care and technology, as well as facility improvement challenges,\u201d Jones said. \u201cWe urge Oklahoma lawmakers to accept all available funding for health care in our state to allow communities like Sayre to transition their health care services.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Blaming \"continual financial strain,\" Sayre Memorial Hospital abruptly closed Monday.
