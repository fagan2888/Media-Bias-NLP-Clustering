Many of those loopholes have become the subject of an annual game in which Congress waits until the last minute \u2014 or longer \u2014 to reinstate the supposedly temporary provisions after they\u2019ve expired.\n\nThe full package of 52 tax breaks, also known as tax extenders, mostly affect business and industry, but quite a few also allow everyday Americans to reduce how much they owe Uncle Sam each year. \u201cThese are popular tax provisions that Americans like to claim,\u201d said Jackie Perlman, senior tax research analyst with the Tax Institute at H&R Block. \u201cThey are expired or need to be renewed. And it\u2019s dependent on Congress to do that.\u201d\n\nRelated: Tax Cheats Rejoice! The IRS Can\u2019t Afford to Track You Down\n\nThis year, six tax benefits have expired and won\u2019t be available to taxpayers preparing their 2015 returns unless lawmakers choose to extend them again:\n\n1. Qualified charitable rollovers\n\nAt age 70.5 years, Americas are required to take a minimum distribution from their IRA or Roth IRA funds. Since 2006, if they roll over part of that distribution directly to a charity, they can reduce their adjusted gross income by that amount, up to $100,000. So, if a senior must take out $5,000 from his IRA to satisfy the minimum distribution requirement, but gives $1,000 to charity, only $4,000 of that distribution is taxed, says Perlman.\n\n2. State and local sales tax deduction\n\nSince 2002, taxpayers who itemized their deductions had the option to claim state and local sales taxes or state and local income taxes on their federal return. They cannot deduct both. If they claimed sales taxes, they would either have to save their receipts throughout the year or tabulate the total they paid in sales taxes using a worksheet or calculator provided by the IRS.\n\nThe provision was especially helpful for residents in Florida, Nevada, Texas, Washington, Wyoming and South Dakota, where there is no income tax. Last year, this deduction was used on 9.75 million tax returns worth $16.14 billion (or $1,655 per return), according to estimates from H&R Block\u2019s Tax Institute using historical IRS data.\n\nRelated: Meet the Two Men Who Can Change Your Tax Rate\n\n3. Mortgage premium insurance deduction\n\nThis deduction allowed taxpayers to subtract their annual payments for private mortgage insurance. Homeowners are required to pay for such insurance if they put less than 20 percent down toward their home purchase. The insurance protects the lender from default on the home loan.\n\nThe deduction was created by the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 and was supposed to expire in 2007. But lawmakers have extended it each year through 2014 to help the housing market recover. Last year, this deduction was taken on 4 million tax returns worth a total of $5.83 billion (or $1,465 per return), according to the Tax Institute.\n\n4. Mortgage debt relief\n\nTypically, the amount of debt that has been canceled or forgiven is taxable. But since 2007, homeowners who had their mortgage restructured or debt forgiven from a foreclosure or short sale were exempt from this taxation up to $2 million under the Mortgage Debt Relief Act. Last year, this deduction was taken on 336,501 tax returns worth $29.42 billion (or $87,422 per return), according to the Tax Institute.\n\n5. Tuition and fees deduction\n\nTaxpayers have been able to deduct higher education expenses paid during the year, up to $4,000, for themselves, their spouse or their dependents. Filers don\u2019t have to itemize their taxes to claim this deduction. It can\u2019t be claimed if married filing separately or if someone claims the filer as a dependent. H&R Block\u2019s Tax Institute estimates that this deduction, which was first instituted in 2002, was taken on 1.2 million tax returns last year worth nearly $2.71 billion (or $2,290 per return), according to H&R Block\u2019s Tax Institute.\n\nRelated: It\u2019s Not Just the Rich Who Would Be Hit by Sanders\u2019 Tax Hikes\n\n6. Educator expense deduction\n\nEducators have been able to deduct up to $250 a year in out-of-pocket expenses for books, supplies, computer equipment or other equipment used in class. This deduction applies to K-12 teachers, counselors, principals or aides who worked 900 hours a school year. Last year, this deduction, which can be claimed without itemizing, was taken on 3.5 million tax returns worth $869.6 million (or $250 per return), according to H&R Block\u2019s Tax Institute.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Republican presidential hopefuls have talked often this year about overhauling the tax", "title": "6 Popular Tax Breaks That Americans Need Congress to Renew", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/10/6-Popular-Tax-Breaks-Americans-Need-Congress-Renew", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/09252013_Ominous_Capitol.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/10/6-Popular-Tax-Breaks-Americans-Need-Congress-Renew", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/09252013_Ominous_Capitol.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Republican presidential hopefuls have talked often this year about overhauling the tax", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThese are popular tax provisions that Americans like to claim,\u201d said Jackie Perlman, senior tax research analyst with the Tax Institute at H&R Block.\nLast year, this deduction was taken on 336,501 tax returns worth $29.42 billion (or $87,422 per return), according to the Tax Institute.\nLast year, this deduction was taken on 4 million tax returns worth a total of $5.83 billion (or $1,465 per return), according to the Tax Institute.\nLast year, this deduction, which can be claimed without itemizing, was taken on 3.5 million tax returns worth $869.6 million (or $250 per return), according to H&R Block\u2019s Tax Institute.\nLast year, this deduction was used on 9.75 million tax returns worth $16.14 billion (or $1,655 per return), according to estimates from H&R Block\u2019s Tax Institute using historical IRS data."}
