The organization is currently under congressional investigation for potentially criminal activity.\n\nUnder suspicion of bias, Harris County, Texas District Attorney Devon Anderson convened a grand jury that cleared Planned Parenthood of any wrongdoing in the video expos\u00e9 and, instead, indicted Center for Medical Progress project lead David Daleiden and his colleague Sandra Merrit. Two pro-choice law professors wrote that the indictment of Daleiden and Merrit amounted to \u201ca stunning act of legal jujitsu\u201d and was a \u201cdeeply disturbing\u201d outcome both for the First Amendment and undercover citizen journalists attempting to expose corruption.\n\nThough Planned Parenthood has denied any wrongdoing in its sale of body parts, the abortion business also released a statement in October announcing it will no longer accept payments for aborted fetal tissue.\n\nThe organization and its leftwing media supporters continue to insist the videos produced by CMP were \u201cdeceptively edited.\u201d However, a Democrat opposition research firm named Fusion \u2013 hired by Planned Parenthood to review the videos \u2014 said that while their analysts observed the videos had been edited, \u201cthe analysis did not reveal widespread evidence of substantive video manipulation.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, Fusion noted, \u201c[A]nalysts found no evidence that CMP inserted dialogue not spoken by Planned Parenthood staff.\u201d\n\nAn analysis by Coalfire, a third-party forensics company hired by Alliance Defending Freedom, found that the videos were \u201cnot manipulated\u201d and that they are \u201cauthentic.\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe this is the most important election of my lifetime,\u201d Clinton added. \u201cAnd this is my first election as a mom. I worry everything I care about is at risk.\u201d\n\nClinton discussed the GOP candidates during the recent debate in Texas.\n\n\u201cThey are almost normalizing hate speech,\u201d she said. \u201cI find it profoundly disturbing,\u201d and added that rhetoric about keeping a list of Muslims and building a wall at the Mexican border is \u201chorrifying.\u201d\n\nClinton also discussed the future of the Supreme Court as an important issue for voters. She reportedly told her listeners the next president will likely choose one or two Supreme Court justices who will make important decisions about gun control, discrimination, and corporate money in politics.\n\nFinally, Clinton addressed healthcare by saying Obamacare \u2013 which she said was once called Hillarycare \u2013 is under continued attack by the GOP-led Congress.\n\n\u201cWe need to defend the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cAnd then we need to do more\u2026to get to 100 percent coverage.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Chelsea Clinton: \u2018We Need to Do Everything We Can to Protect Planned Parenthood\u2019", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Chelsea Clinton: \u2018We Need to Do Everything We Can to Protect Planned Parenthood\u2019", "title": "Chelsea Clinton: \u2018We Need to Do Everything We Can to Protect Planned Parenthood\u2019 - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/04/chelsea-clinton-elle-mag-cover.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/02/29/chelsea-clinton-we-need-to-do-everything-we-can-to-protect-planned-parenthood/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Chelsea Clinton: \u2018We Need to Do Everything We Can to Protect Planned Parenthood\u2019", "title": "Chelsea Clinton: \u2018We Need to Do Everything We Can to Protect Planned Parenthood\u2019 - Breitbart", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/04/chelsea-clinton-elle-mag-cover.jpg", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Chelsea Clinton, criminal investigation of Planned Parenthood, Hillary Clinton 2016, Hillarycare, obamacare, Planned Parenthood, Planned Parenthood congressional investigation, Planned Parenthood videos, sale of aborted baby parts, super tuesday,2016 Presidential Race, Big Government, Hillary Clinton,Chelsea Clinton", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "super tuesday", "published_time": "2016-02-29T23:16:22-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,2016 Presidential Race,Hillary Clinton"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\u201cWe need to do everything we can to protect\u201d Planned Parenthood, Chelsea Clinton told voters in Rochester, Minn.\u201cIt\u2019s important that we all care about Planned Parenthood,\u201d she said in advance of the Super Tuesday votes, reports the Post-Bulletin.\nThis month, Planned Parenthood said they would spend millions of dollars to help Chelsea\u2019s mother, Hillary Clinton, get elected in November.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERChelsea Clinton was responding to a question by a 17 year-old girl, who said she is a peer educator at Planned Parenthood and was concerned about the future of the organization.\n\u201cWe need to defend the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Clinton said.\nThough Planned Parenthood has denied any wrongdoing in its sale of body parts, the abortion business also released a statement in October announcing it will no longer accept payments for aborted fetal tissue."}
