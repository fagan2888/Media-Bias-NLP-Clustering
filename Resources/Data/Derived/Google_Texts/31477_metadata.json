One is on private property north of the Lone Tree Cemetery. The other is in the Bear Creek wilderness, according to the sheriff\u2019s website.\n\n\u201cWhat we are seeing is beyond illegal. These trashed sites are a threat to public health, the environment and also pose enormous obstacles physically and financially to clean them up,\u201d Masters said. \u201cHuman waste, beer cans, liquor bottles, garbage and other hazardous waste have been found at numerous sites over the last year.\u201d\n\nThe discovery of two new illegal sites follows the discovery of one of the worst cases of an illegal campsite ever found d in the county, off the Jud Wiebe trail in Telluride.\n\nA man has been charged with violations relating to illegally residing and littering in a National Forest and is scheduled to appear in Federal court in Durango.\n\nThe sheriff hiked through the woods to record trash left at the encampments. He sometimes is short of breath and apologizes for having a shaky camera.\n\nAt one point, he expresses surprise as he sees what he believes is a wedding dress.\n\n\u201cIt gets to the point where it is so much piled up you can\u2019t get through without climbing over this refuse,\u201d Masters said on the video. \u201cUnbelievable mess.\u201d\n\nThe sheriff fears a spike in illegal encampments as the festival season approaches. He is asking residents to support social services available in town, rather than give money to transients.\n\n\u201cSome of these alcoholic and borderline, insane-transients have made a conscious lifestyle decision to come here and then degrade our environment,\u201d Masters said. \u201cWe should not encourage them. Many of these transient panhandlers impacting the area are simply trying to get money for drugs or alcohol.\u201d\n\nNoelle Phillips: 303-954-1661, nphillips@denverpost.com or twitter.com/Noelle_Phillips", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "San Miguel sheriff disgusted over camps outside Telluride", "title": "San Miguel sheriff disgusted over camps outside Telluride", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/05/23/san-miguel-sheriff-disgusted-over-camps-outside-telluride/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-23T09:08:37+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-23T09:08:37+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda304\"", "article_summary": "San Miguel County Sheriff Bill Masters\u2019 disgust is evident as he narrates a video of an illegal encampment in a wilderness area outside Telluride.\n\u201cAbsolutely outrageous.\u201dThe sheriff is calling for more aggressive enforcement of illegal camps outside the popular mountain town, known for its series of summer festivals, including the Telluride Bluegrass Festival.\n\u201cCan you imagine what the clean up cost of this is gonna be?\u201d Masters said on the video.\n\u201cUnbelievable mess.\u201dThe sheriff fears a spike in illegal encampments as the festival season approaches.\nMany of these transient panhandlers impacting the area are simply trying to get money for drugs or alcohol.\u201dNoelle Phillips: 303-954-1661, nphillips@denverpost.com or twitter.com/Noelle_Phillips"}
