Chris Christie, in his State of the State address last week, called \u201can insatiable beast.\u201d\n\nIn boom years, New Jersey leaders shortchanged the pension system, and those \u201csins of the past,\u201d Christie said, \u201chave made the system unaffordable.\u201d\n\nFully funding the pension system this fiscal year would cost $3.9 billion, but Christie cut the pension payment to just $700 million to balance the budget \u2014 a move that landed him in court, battling an attempt by unions to force him to pay more.\n\nUnion leaders accuse the governor of going back on his word to have the state make full payments in exchange for higher contributions from workers. It\u2019s a hot issue in Trenton made even bigger with Christie considering a White House run.\n\n\n\nThe governor has called for more changes to the system to bring down costs, and over the summer assembled a bipartisan commission to issue recommendations.\n\nThat commission, which has yet to release its final report, echoed Christie\u2019s call for additional reforms.\n\nHere\u2019s a recap of what\u2019s happening with New Jersey\u2019s pension mess:\n\nWhat went wrong?\n\nNew Jersey\u2019s pension funds were flush at the turn of the 21st century. But since 1996, governors from both parties have been underfunding the system, making payments far below what actuaries recommend.\n\nThe state skipped payments altogether from 2001 to 2004, when the annual required contribution called for $2.8 billion. And while the state was taking a pension holiday, it increased benefits for employees.\n\n\n\nEvery time the state doesn\u2019t make a full payment, it\u2019s like paying only the minimum on your credit card bill while continuing to charge stuff. So while the ultimate cost of pensions grows, partial payments by the state in one year makes the next payment even bigger \u2014 and harder for the state to make. It\u2019s multiplied like crazy for the last decade.\n\nThe stock market had a hand in it, too. New Jersey lost $20 billion in the dot-com bust between 2000 and 2003, according to the Hall Institute of Public Policy, and was knocked around again by the Great Recession.\n\nIs it true that Christie has contributed more than any other governor?\n\nAfter skipping a $3.1 billion payment in fiscal year 2011, Christie contributed $484 million in 2012, $1 billion in 2013 and $696 million in 2014 \u2014 more than any of his five predecessors. He\u2019s expected to make a $681 million payment this year.\n\nFormer Gov. Christie Whitman\u2019s payments totaled roughly $1 billion, while the state contributed $100 million under James E. McGreevey and $2.1 billion under Jon Corzine.\n\nBut Christie\u2019s payments are still a fraction of what is needed to keep the pension system from piling up even more debt.\n\nWhat did the 2011 pension law do?\n\nThe Legislature adopted and Christie signed into law a pension reform package to gradually increase the state\u2019s pension contribution over seven years until it reached the full annual required contribution.\n\nEmployees had to make concessions too: the law raised the retirement age, suspended cost-of-living increases for retirees, and required workers to contribute more toward their pensions and health benefits.\n\nThe contribution rate for workers enrolled in the Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System and Teachers\u2019 Pension and Annuity Fund increased will increase from 5.5 percent to 7.5 percent over seven years.\n\nPolice and firemen\u2019s rates increased from 8.5 percent to 10 percent of pay, and state police\u2019s contribution jumped from 7.5 percent to 9 percent. Judicial employees will phase in an additional 9 percent of their salary.\n\nI thought those changes were going to save the system. What happened?\n\nThe state got bad news last spring, when tax collections came in much lower than the Christie administration expected, blowing holes in the previous and current fiscal years\u2019 budgets.\n\nChristie reduced the pension payment for the fiscal year that ended June 30 from $1.6 billion to $696 million and the payment for the current fiscal year from $2.25 billion to $681 million.\n\nThe remaining payments are enough to cover employees currently receiving benefits, but it doesn\u2019t leave anything for the unfunded liability.\n\nBut even before the revenue emergency, Christie was warning that pensions and benefits needed to be revised again because their costs would swallow up a bigger chunk of the state budget each year.\n\nConceding he needed more help, Christie last summer appointed a commission to come up with recommendations on how to revamp the system. The panel has not yet come up with a final report, which is months late.\n\nThe unions have taken Christie to court over both pension cuts, and lost the first round in June. Superior Court Judge Mary Jacobson said the fiscal emergency backed the governor into corner, and making the full pension payment would produce \u201csevere and immediate impacts on vulnerable populations.\u201d\n\nChristie\u2019s administration challenged the legality of the 2011 pension law during a hearing Thursday, with lawyers calling it unconstitutional and saying Christie doesn\u2019t have to pay. Jacobson has not issued a ruling.\n\nHow bad is it?\n\nNew Jersey faces $37 billion in unfunded pension liabilities, according to a report from Christie\u2019s pension commission. Each household would have to write a check for $12,000 to close the gap, the commission said.\n\nAn actuarial rule change that assumes less optimistic investment returns doubled the unfunded liability figure to $83 billion, and pushed the dates that two of the largest pension funds will go broke to 2024 and 2027.\n\nThe state has $40 billion in assets, covering 32.6 percent of its $122.8 billion in liabilities.\n\nHow does that compare to the rest of the country?\n\nNew Jersey\u2019s pension shortfall ranks fourth worst in the country, behind Illinois, Connecticut and Kentucky.\n\nTwo-thirds of states contributed at least 90 percent of full funding in fiscal year 2013, according to Moody\u2019s. New Jersey contributed 28 percent.\n\nWhat about unfunded health care benefit liabilities?\n\nRetiree health benefits add another $53 billion in unfunded liabilities.\n\nThose costs consume 8 percent of the state budget, and according to Christie\u2019s commission, could grow to 14 percent of the budget within 10 years.\n\nPart of the problem, the commission says, is that 80 percent of public workers are enrolled in what would be considered a \u201cplatinum\u201d plan under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cThe state health programs provide generous benefits with little pricing incentive for employees to select anything but plans with the most comprehensive coverage and highest cost to the state,\u201d the report says.\n\nIn addition, the commission noted that beginning in 2018, the federal government will impose a 40 percent excise tax on such plans that would cost the state another $58 million that year and $284 million by 2022.\n\nWhat about the municipalities?\n\nLocal government portions of the pension plans are much better funded than the state\u2019s. Moody\u2019s Investors Service said late last year that these local governments \u201ccurrently are not affected by the state\u2019s severe pension underfunding problem.\u201d\n\nLocal funding for the Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System is 73.9 percent, and it\u2019s 77 percent for the Police and Firemen\u2019s Retirement System \u2014 the two state and local government shared plans. The state government portions are funded at 46 percent and 48.6 percent, respectively.\n\n\u201cCities and counties have historically contributed to PERS and PFRS at much higher rates than the state,\u201d Moody\u2019s said. \u201cThese local governments\u2019 annual rates determined contributions., determined by state statute, have ranged from 84 percent to 92 percent of (annual required contribution) in recent years, versus the state\u2019s very low 4 percent to 28 percent.\"\n\nWhat\u2019s next?\n\nTrenton waits for Christie\u2019s commission to make its recommendations, and Jacobson\u2019s ruling on whether or not Christie had the right to knock out $1.5 billion from the current budget. With his eyes on the White House, Christie has been taking aim at public employee pension and health benefits. Democrats have said they won\u2019t discuss making workers pay more without guarantees that the state will make full payments, perhaps by changing the state constitution.\n\nSamantha Marcus may be reached at smarcus@njadvancemedia.com .
