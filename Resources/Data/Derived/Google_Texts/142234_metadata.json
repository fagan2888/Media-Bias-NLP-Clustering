WSJ's Michael Casey and Paul Vigna discuss. Photo: Getty.\n\nHave you felt it? Getty Images\n\nThere has been an awakening. Have you felt it?\n\nWe refer not to the next \u201cStar Wars\u201d movie, but the capital markets, which have been unusually serene over the past two years. Oh, sure, there have been hiccups here and there, there always are, but for the most part, the market\u2019s lulled investors into a sleepy contentedness. Several measures bear this out: the VIX has been historically low, and the St. Louis Fed\u2019s market stress index has also been historically low.\n\nThose golden slumbers may be ending.\n\nEquity valuations by any number of measures are at a higher point that in any post-war era save the height of the dot-com bubble, noted Lindsey Group\u2019s chief market analyst Peter Boockvar. We\u2019re talking such measures price to sales, market cap to GDP, the cyclically adjusted PE ratio developed by Robert Shiller, or Tobin\u2019s Q, a ratio developed by Yale\u2019s James Tobin that measures a company\u2019s market value against the replacement value of its assets.\n\nHigh valuations aren\u2019t necessarily a problem in and of themselves; Mr. Lindsey points out that the same circumstance existed a year ago as well. The problem is when valuations are high at the same time that the market shifts, because far too many investors will have very little margin of safety \u2013 the concept coined by the godfather of value investing, Benjamin Graham.\n\nThe margin of safety is essentially the difference between an asset\u2019s intrinsic value and its market value. It\u2019s a corollary of \u201cbuy low, sell high.\u201d If you buy when prices are low but intrinsic value is high, you have a margin of safety. If you buy when prices are high, higher than intrinsic value, you have no margin of safety.\n\n\u201cI bring this up,\u201d he wrote, \u201cbecause with little to no margin of safety at current market levels, valuation in 2015 should be a key focus that investors should be more sensitive to (has already begun in small caps in 2014) because things are about to change with respect to the activities of central banks and it\u2019s been central banks that have elevated the multiples across a broad spectrum of securities.\u201d\n\nThe world\u2019s three major central banks are all facing their own pivot points, and it\u2019s not clear what that means for the support they\u2019ve provided the market. The Fed is looking at its rate-hike regime, the ECB is struggling to craft a broad stimulus plan acceptable to all of its leadership, and the Bank of Japan is seeing that the massive stimulus plan it launched in conjunction with \u201cAbenomics\u201d has not revived growth.\n\n\u201cWe are reaching the final act of central bank largesse that has never before been seen,\u201d Mr. Boockvar said. \u201cCentral banks have got nothing left. We\u2019ll now see who can stand on their own and who can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nOr, to put it another way, is it really plausible that crude oil prices crash by more than 40%, but stock prices keep rising? \u201cGiven that crude has been a top story on financial networks and a major headline in the mainstream news, as well, it\u2019s quite amazing that the [S&P 500] continued to inch higher the last few weeks,\u201d said Frank Cappelleri, executive director of institutional equities at Instinet. \u201cWhen a major asset class experiences perpetual pain like this, it can only be ignored for so long.\u201d\n\nThen again, maybe what\u2019s happening is even bigger than that.\n\n\u201cIn my view, we are likely witnessing the peak of the third equity valuation bubble in the past 14 years,\u201d John Hussman of Hussman Funds wrote on his blog this week, \u201cthe first two which saw major indices plunge by at least 50%.\u201d But of course, Mr. Hussman is one of the last bears standing, and he\u2019s been saying variations of that dire pronouncement for some time.\n\nMarkets move in cycles, and Mr. Hussman is likely to be right eventually. The point isn\u2019t whether or not that will happen. The point is that, when the markets strike back, people with a margin of safety are likely to feel safer than those without.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "The market's unusually calm demeanor is being upset, as central banks pivot, and investors who are over-extended are going to find themselves with no margin of safety.", "title": "A Force Awakens in the Markets", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/12/09/a-force-awakens-in-the-markets/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/MK-CH695_DISNEY_G_20131107200652.jpg"}, "site": "WSJMoneyBeat", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "A Force Awakens in the Markets", "description": "The market's unusually calm demeanor is being upset, as central banks pivot, and investors who are over-extended are going to find themselves with no margin of safety.", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Paul Vigna", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "MoneyBeat Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "MoneyBeat", "article.summary": "The market's unusually calm demeanor is being upset, as central banks pivot, and investors who are over-extended are going to find themselves with no margin of safety.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-12-09T17:55:09-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-139", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/12/09/a-force-awakens-in-the-markets/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-MBB-30674", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "The market's unusually calm demeanor is being upset, as central banks pivot, and investors who are over-extended are going to find themselves with no margin of safety.", "title": "A Force Awakens in the Markets", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/12/09/a-force-awakens-in-the-markets/", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/MK-CH695_DISNEY_G_20131107200652.jpg", "height": 369}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "MoneyBeat", "article.id": "BL-MBB-30674", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-12-10T14:46:39-05:00"}, "article_summary": "The point is that, when the markets strike back, people with a margin of safety are likely to feel safer than those without.\nThe margin of safety is essentially the difference between an asset\u2019s intrinsic value and its market value.\nWe refer not to the next \u201cStar Wars\u201d movie, but the capital markets, which have been unusually serene over the past two years.\nMarkets move in cycles, and Mr. Hussman is likely to be right eventually.\nOh, sure, there have been hiccups here and there, there always are, but for the most part, the market\u2019s lulled investors into a sleepy contentedness."}
