JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - Cars coming off Interstate 10 and Stockton Street have crashed into the Gateway Rehab facility on Stockton Street three different times in a matter of 18 months.

The most recent crash was in the building where the center's waiting room is. Thankfully, no one was hurt, but people there worry it’s only a matter of time before someone is.

The staff at Gateway said they’re tired of people driving recklessly and hitting their building.

"When they come off there, sometimes they're coming pretty fast and sometimes it's raining and they seem to make that turn and they slide into the building," Vice President of Facility Operations Raphael Thomas said.

The most recent point of impact was in someone's office.

A woman would have been hit if she hadn't gotten up moments before, they said.

"She could have been killed and anyone in the building that they are not sectioned that are coming through. We have clients in there. They can be injured and killed very easy with a car coming through, especially when you have trucks, big trucks coming through, they can slide right through that wall," said Thomas.

The Florida Department of Transportation put up signs indicating a tight turn and changed the lines on the road to better direct traffic, but the Gateway staff want more done.

"It’s going to happen again, you know. It's already happened three times. It's going to happen again, so we need something in there, a barrier or guardrail to protect the, not the building, but the clients in the building," said Thomas.

Gateway is repairing the most recent damaged office, and .some of those repair costs are coming out of pocket.

They have been working to get Public Works to put up a guardrail. If the city doesn't, then Gateway will do what they can to try to keep its staff and clients safe.
