The Catholic-based health system also posted operating profit of $284 million, up more than fourfold from last year's operating profit of $62 million. Dignity Health's operating margin increased from 0.7 percent to 2.7 percent.\n\nIn a news release, Dignity Health President and CEO Lloyd Dean said the organization has worked aggressively to both reduce costs and improve the quality of care. He added these themes have been part of Dignity Health \"long before passage of the Affordable Care Act.\"\n\nDignity Health CFO Michael Blaszyk said the health system will still face financial challenges over the next several years, especially since Medicare and Medicaid patients represent more than 60 percent of Dignity Health's payer mix. However, he sees positives in the healthcare reform law.\n\n\"As we evolve from a fee-for-service to pay-for-value system, reducing costs and achieving efficiencies will become even more critical,\" Mr. Blaszyk said in the release. \"We are encouraged by the launch of the healthcare marketplaces and the expansion of Medicaid, as we think these will be important and meaningful ways to stabilize the system by allowing more people to obtain health insurance.\"\n\nThis month, Dignity Health also announced it created a joint venture revenue cycle company with Optum. The groups anticipate the new company, Optum360, will simplify the billing process and result in significant backend savings.\n\nMore Articles on Hospital Finance:\n\nMoody's: Health Insurance Exchange Uncertainties Hurt Nonprofit Hospitals\n\n83% of Connecticut Hospitals Had Positive Margins in 2012\n\nStudy: Medicare, Medicaid ED Patients Ding Hospital Profitability\n\n\u00a9 Copyright ASC COMMUNICATIONS 2016.
