Oh, how valiant they are, these supporters of developers, to take on such a noble cause and save the less fortunate among us by supporting thousands of new Tier 3 housing units and all the ground floor retail goodness those projects would surely bring to the benefit of us all. Who could question the purity of their mission as they strive to create their vibrant new Santa Monica, which is oh-so-threatened by evil resident advocates and Residocracy upstarts who dare raise a lance to oppose them? Why wouldn\u2019t we herald these dedicated-to-development Davids in their golden quest to counter an angry army of resident Goliaths?\n\nWe will not because residents are smart enough to know the story rings hollow. Santa Monica Forward is a group of pro-development, high-density proponents attempting to put a \u201ccommunity\u201d face on profiteering. Its mission is a sham; its promises are hollow. It is merely the latest act in a much broader campaign to enlist support for a pro-development agenda designed to counter true grassroots gains made by residents who make up Santa Monica\u2019s real community groups: Wilmont, Northeast Neighbors, Mid-City Neighbors, Friends of Sunset Park, NOMA, OPA, PNA, Santa Monica Coalition For a Livable City, and now Residocracy.\n\nThe mission statement of Santa Monica Forward is some of the best \u201cThink-Speak\u201d since Orwell\u2019s \u201c1984.\u201d What\u2019s \u201cprogressive\u201d are the progressively higher profits developers stand to make unless residents see this group for who it really represents: developers who care about maximizing profits and nothing else. There is nothing forward-thinking about the deception of politicians and builders whose past promises have delivered us the urban sprawl we now grapple with every day. This group speaks loftily of \u201cdiversity\u201d and \u201cinclusiveness\u201d but closes its Facebook page and breeds divisiveness as it strives to divide us, our older from our young. And their \u201csustainability\u201d will sustain only the profit margins from dozens of new projects that would further drain our water and choke our air and our streets with more traffic.\n\nTheir urban policy shills preach the need for more buildings with less parking, claiming more parking attracts more cars. They argue Santa Monica\u2019s population has stayed relatively static for decades at around 90,000, but neglect to mention our dayside population routinely expands to three times that number. They support another 5,000 housing units in our already dense city and say everyone will just ride a bike or the new Expo or the Big Blue Bus (with its shiny new blue stools) on Wilshire Boulevard. I\u2019ve never seen one of their designer-suit developer friends on a bus or a bike. And here\u2019s one final inconvenient truth: Very few of those who truly need the housing Santa Monica Forward and their chorus of development brethren pant to build will ever be able to afford the market-rate housing units they strive to stack in our city like so many sardines in a can.\n\nSo, no, our horns are not trumpeting their arrival. They\u2019ve been here all the while. And we\u2019ve heard their song before.\n\nJohn C.
