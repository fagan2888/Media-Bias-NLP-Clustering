But Governor Matt Bevin has announced that he plans to dismantle it.\n\nThe move will force all Kentuckians looking for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, to use the federal health insurance site, instead of Kynect.\n\nBut with the success of Kynect, many are wondering if it's not broken, why fix it?\n\n\"Kynect is just for the state of Kentucky. It was set up on exchange to get your tax credit, it's a lot easier to use than 'HealthCare.gov', that's the exchange for those states that have not set up their own exchange,\" Individual Specialist at Van Meter Insurance, Chappell Watt said.\n\nIn a statement from the governor's office, the Kynect program is called a 'redundancy'.\n\n\"I've heard that people in the past have had problems with Kynect, and Governor Bevin is going to make some changes, maybe change might be good for them,\" insurance carrier Brenda Iler said.\n\nAnd beginning in 2017, customers will start from square one.\n\n\"And basically do everything over again,\" Watt said.\n\nOne health insurance carrier says he doesn't have an opinion about Bevin's change.\n\n\"Currently, I fall underneath the federal program because of the Tricare and VA.gov. So I don't have anything or never did have anything with the state,\" Joseph Parker said.\n\nNPR reports that more than 500,000 Kentuckians have gotten health insurance through Kynect.\n\n\"As busy as the federal exchange gets, this was kind of a local, you could call somebody local and do it pretty easily this way,\" Watt added.\n\nShe continued to say that the insurance coverage will not be any different once the change comes in 2017.\n\nThe last day to enroll for 2016 coverage under Kynect is Sunday, January 31st.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "The move will force all Kentuckians looking for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, to use the federal health insurance site, instead of Kynect.", "language": "english", "author": "Jacqueline Nie", "og": {"url": "http://www.wbko.com/content/news/kynect-366941011.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/421*315/kynect2.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The move will force all Kentuckians looking for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, to use the federal health insurance site, instead of Kynect.", "title": "Gov.
