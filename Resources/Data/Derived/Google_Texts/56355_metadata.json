Some said they turned down offers of better salaries because of the district's health care coverage.\n\nBoard President Richard Vladovic, a former teacher and administrator, said the health care benefits were among the reasons he first came to the district. He supported Obamacare, he said, because people across the United States deserve coverage.\n\n\u201cThis is not going to wreck anybody, not going to hurt anybody,\u201d Vladovic said of the district's benefits.\n\nVladovic is facing a runoff next month along with board members Tamar Galatzan, and Bennett Kayser. Various school labor unions support each of the incumbents.\n\nGeorge McKenna, who ran unopposed, was the only other board member to support Ratliff's motion.\n\n\u201cPopularity is not my interest. I am interested in the information here,\u201d McKenna said. He went on to suggest members rejected the call for more information because they would learn something they \u201cdidn\u2019t want to know.\u201d\n\nThe three-year, $3.3 billion health care package is separate from the negotiations underway with the district's teacher union. The two sides remain apart on salary increases, which the teachers have not had for eight years.", "article_metadata": {"author": "Southern California Public Radio", "og": {"site_name": "Southern California Public Radio", "description": "A majority of LAUSD's school board approved a $1 billion employee health care agreement, but turned down a call to look into the district's mounting financial obligations.", "title": "LAUSD's multibillion-dollar health care deal wins approval", "url": "http://www.scpr.org/news/2015/04/14/51022/lausd-board-backs-1-billion-employee-health-care-a/", "image": {"width": 1024, "identifier": "http://a.scpr.org/i/21f859404ab1035509784c03ca8af5c1/82603-full.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 682}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "http://scpr.org", "description": "Member-supported public radio for Southern California.
