Ted Cruz\u2019s comments on the net neutrality debate Monday accomplished two things. One, they successfully mobilized a coalition to oppose the president. Two, they set the internet ablaze. Cruz may have razed the structures on which internet \u201cfast lanes\u201d are built before this matter is even resolved.\n\nIn response to President Obama\u2019s call on the Federal Communications Commission to \u201cimplement the strongest possible rules to protect net neutrality,\u201d Cruz tweeted the most unflattering comparison involving the buzziest term in telecommunications regulation:\n\n\"Net Neutrality\" is Obamacare for the Internet; the Internet should not operate at the speed of government. \u2014 Senator Ted Cruz (@SenTedCruz) November 10, 2014\n\nHe elaborated on Facebook, writing that the president\u2019s suggested approach of bringing consumer broadband under tighter federal oversight \u201cputs the government in charge of determining Internet pricing, terms of service, and what types of products and services can be delivered, leading to fewer choices, fewer opportunities, and higher prices for consumers.\u201d Without such regulation, proponents of the president\u2019s plan or something like it say, internet service providers are the bogeymen. Were the FCC to permit \u201cfast lanes,\u201d they say ISPs like Comcast would have undue authority to discriminate how quickly they deliver companies\u2019 products by price. For example, if a small company were unable to afford or declined to pay an ISP a fee for faster content delivery, would it sink?\n\nThe debate aside for a moment, Cruz completely hacked off the web. Imagine his comments were a book. Here\u2019s how the reviews on the jacket cover would read:\n\n\u201d \u2026 a disingenuous, chickenshit political maneuver and nothing more.\u201d \u2014 Gizmodo\n\n\u201c\u2026 an insanely cynical tactic that should worry all citizens regardless of political stripe \u2026\u201d \u2014 The Verge\n\n\u201d \u2026 completely nonsensical \u2026\u201d \u2014 Salon\n\n\u201cLet this be a reminder about how damn glad we are that Congress is not in charge of this critically important issue.\u201d \u2014 Tech Crunch 1\n\n\u201cWhat the f*ck does that mean, \u2018The speed of government?\u2019 \u201d \u2014 Cenk Uygur\n\n\u201cWhat does that mean, \u2018To play us out?\u2019 Otherwise, a thought-provoking read.\u201d \u2014 Bill O\u2019Reilly\n\nContinuing the internet dwellers\u2019 tradition of \u2018splaining things to people they see as dumb \u2014 what a self-esteem booster and adrenaline rush it must be! \u2014 The Oatmeal came up with a cute cartoon that \u201cdestroyed\u201d or \u201cdismantled\u201d Cruz\u2019s argument, or \u201cdisemboweled it in totality, leaving its entrails strewn across your bandwidth and accessible free of charge (take that, Verizon!)\u201d if we\u2019re really getting colorful.\n\nThe cartoon called the internet \u201cthat throbbing, fractious hydra of whirring, blinking hard drives,\u201d which is fittingly pornographic, if not terribly helpful. If the internet were truly a hydra, wouldn\u2019t the hard drives have shorted in the water? Or at least shrunk. Whatever.\n\nAnd whatever the merits of Cruz\u2019s overtly political description and the offended and hyperbolic responses to it, the whole party is perhaps guilty of this foul: \u201cThe net neutrality debate has got many facets to it, and most of the points of the debate are artificial, distracting, and based on an incorrect mental model on how the internet works,\u201d Dave Taht, an open-source networking software developer, told WIRED. (For more information about that model, read the WIRED piece, as well as this paper from Reason.)\n\nThe internet evolves with great speed, and to believe that it is \u201cneutral\u201d by default is unrealistic and erroneous. From congressional testimony from tech expert and researcher Craig Labovitz this year:\n\n\u201cWhereas Internet traffic was once broadly distributed across thousands of companies, we found that by 2009 half of all Internet traffic originated in less than 150 large content and content distribution companies. By May of 2014, this number had dropped by a factor of five. Today, just 30 companies, including Netflix and Google, contribute on average more than one half of all Internet traffic in the United States during prime time hours.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause these companies are moving so much traffic on their own,\u201d WIRED notes, \u201cthey\u2019ve been forced to make special arrangements with the country\u2019s internet service providers that can facilitate the delivery of their sites and applications.\u201d\n\nWhat much of the net neutrality debate misses \u2014 and would surely reassure supporters of more regulation if the following were to come to fruition \u2014 is the development of more competition among ISPs. Only one-quarter of Americans can choose among two or more ISPs for a 25 Mbps connection, which the FCC views as the emerging staple consumer speed.\n\nSome municipalities are trying to build their own broadband networks, but face legal pushback from ISPs. As Ars Technica notes, it\u2019s difficult as all heck for a private entity to enter the game, largely because of cost. In any case, there\u2019s room for that hackneyed word, \u201cinnovation.\u201d\n\n\u201cBandwidth is like putty in the hands of entrepreneurs \u2014 new regulations are cement,\u201d a piece from Andy Kessler in The Weekly Standard observed eight years ago. \u201cNet neutrality is already the boring old status quo. But don\u2019t give in to the cable/(telecom) status quo either. Far better to have competition, as long as it\u2019s real, than let Congress shape the coming communications chaos and creativity.\u201d (The net neutrality issue was previously a hot legislative item in Congress.)\n\nThe bottom line is that there is no easily understood, crafted and implemented policy or rule to address what has the pro-regulation folks worried: the \u201cunequal\u201d treatment of data. What is certain is that reclassifying broadband as essentially a public utility under 80-year-old law so it can be tightly regulated by the government \u2014 as the president called for Monday \u2014 could be an unreasonably forceful and misguided attempt to resolve a concern that can be addressed better through other means.\n\n\u2014\n\n1 The URL to this is just too much: http://techcrunch.com/2014/11/10/hahahahahahahahahahahahahahaah-ted-cruz-you-silly-senator/.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Sen.
