Most Americans would likely answer \u201cyes.\u201d But what\u2019s a \u201cgood reason?\u201d Must the government\u2019s allegedly \u201cgood\u201d reasons be supported with evidence or should courts just give the government the benefit of the doubt?\n\nBoth progressives and conservatives often do ask judges to put a thumb on the judicial scales in the government\u2019s favor. Progressives see government as generally a force for good (except when certain preferred rights are threatened, as defined by progressive elites), while conservatives want judges to defer to the elected branches (except when Obamacare or other disfavored federal programs are at issue). Thus we have the twin scourges of judicial adventurism and minimalism \u2013 rewriting or ignoring inconvenient constitutional or statutory provisions \u2013 instead of unblinkered judicial enforcement of the law.\n\nIn other words, both progressives and conservatives miss the boat when they focus on judicial modes (whether a ruling is \u201cactivist,\u201d an empty term meaning that its user disagrees) rather than interpretative theories (originalism vs. living constitutionalism, textualism vs. purposivism). Indeed, even people who care about judicial modes should want judges who apply their preferred interpretive theory without regard to extra-legal considerations and without adopting biases towards the government or any other type of party. The nomenclature is less important than the substance, but \u201cjudicial engagement\u201d is increasingly becoming the name for the alternative to the wholly unsatisfactory debate about judicial \u201cactivism\u201d and \u201crestraint.\u201d\n\nJudicial engagement is a term coined by the Institute for Justice (IJ) to describe the judicial mode that focuses on interpretive theories rather than whether a judge is \u201cactive\u201d or \u201cpassive.\u201d It\u2019s an approach to judicial review that provides a means of ensuring that Americans receive an honest, reasoned explanation in court whenever they allege a plausible abuse of government power.\n\nJudicial engagement involves a genuine, impartial search for the truth concerning the government\u2019s means and ends, grounded in reliable evidence. An engaged judge will place the burden on the government to demonstrate that its actions are justified by a constitutionally proper end. IJ\u2019s Center for Judicial Engagement \u2013 led by my friend Clark Neily, whose deputy is former Cato legal intern Evan Bernick \u2013 has published its first annual review of the judiciary\u2019s performance, \u201cEnforcing the Constitution\u201d, explaining the concept of judicial engagement as well as its opposite, judicial abdication, and summarizing cases decided over the past year that vividly demonstrate the difference between meaningful and meaningless judicial review.\n\nJudicial engagement sounds like something that judges should be doing already, but it\u2019s the exception rather than the rule. At present, judicial engagement is reserved for a handful of constitutional cases implicating so-called \u201cfundamental rights\u201d that the Supreme Court has identified on an ad hoc basis over the years, or those involving suspect classifications. The Court has held, and lower courts have understood, the default standard \u2013 the so-called \u201crational basis test\u201d \u2013 to require reflexive judicial deference to the government\u2019s factual assertions and even oblige judges to invent justifications for the government\u2019s actions if the government\u2019s lawyers can\u2019t do so on their own.\n\nIn other contexts as well, courts have bent over backwards to say \u201cyes\u2019 to government, refusing to invalidate government actions unless they are clearly, unambiguously prohibited by the constitutional text, without any reference to the Constitution\u2019s core function: securing individual rights. Simply put, this is not adjudication \u2013 it\u2019s an abdication of judicial responsibility \u2013 and it\u2019s incapable of preventing illegitimate assumptions of power by the political branches.\n\n\u201cEnforcing the Constitution\u201d illustrates the concepts of engagement and abdication through 20 important cases decided in 2014 and 2015, 10 of which showcase the kind of judicial review that\u2019s required if the courts are to serve as \u201cbulwarks of liberty,\u201d 10 of which saw judges abdicating their responsibility to keep the political branches in check. They come from state and federal courts, including the Supreme Court. They involve SWAT raids on barbershops, licensing schemes for tour guides, gun rights, gay marriage, raisin pilfering, and Obamacare SCOTUScare RobertsCare the Affordable Care Act. Each case tells a story; some offer inspiration, others serve as cautionary tales. To prepare readers for the journey, the report provides a taxonomy of engagement and abdication \u2013 I highly recommend this part, which is a timeless rubric by which to evaluate all judicial rulings \u2013 so readers can determine for themselves when judges are performing their duty, or neglecting it.\n\nThe Constitution was written to empower government to secure our liberty, but then limit it to protect us against the government\u2019s own excesses \u2013 recall the \u201cif men were angels\u201d bit in Federalist 51, which made it into my wedding \u2013 but those limits are meaningless unless judges enforce the Constitution and stop public officials when they overstep their bounds. Decades of judicial abdication have given us far more government than the Constitution permits, and far less freedom than it guarantees. Judicial engagement offers defenders of liberty an approach to judging that is capable of delivering on the Constitution\u2019s unparalleled promise.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Judges should judge, rather than deferring to the government or being concerned with whether a particular law or state action is upheld.", "og": {"site_name": "Cato Institute", "description": "Judges should judge, rather than deferring to the government or being concerned with whether a particular law or state action is upheld.", "title": "Judicial Engagement, Illustrated", "url": "http://www.cato.org/blog/judicial-engagement-illustrated", "image": "http://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/default_images/blog_torch_large.gif", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.cato.org/blog/judicial-engagement-illustrated", "title": "Judicial Engagement, Illustrated", "description": "Judges should judge, rather than deferring to the government or being concerned with whether a particular law or state action is upheld.", "card": "summary", "creator": "@CatoInstitute"}, "robots": "noodp", "site": "Cato Institute", "node_creation_date": "2015/10/16", "fb": {"admins": 5311211, "app_id": 158687980817033}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-19T08:30:11-04:00"}, "publication_date": "2015/10/19", "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcffee\"", "article_summary": "IJ\u2019s Center for Judicial Engagement \u2013 led by my friend Clark Neily, whose deputy is former Cato legal intern Evan Bernick \u2013 has published its first annual review of the judiciary\u2019s performance, \u201cEnforcing the Constitution\u201d, explaining the concept of judicial engagement as well as its opposite, judicial abdication, and summarizing cases decided over the past year that vividly demonstrate the difference between meaningful and meaningless judicial review.\nJudicial engagement offers defenders of liberty an approach to judging that is capable of delivering on the Constitution\u2019s unparalleled promise.\nJudicial engagement involves a genuine, impartial search for the truth concerning the government\u2019s means and ends, grounded in reliable evidence.\nJudicial engagement sounds like something that judges should be doing already, but it\u2019s the exception rather than the rule.\nDecades of judicial abdication have given us far more government than the Constitution permits, and far less freedom than it guarantees."}
