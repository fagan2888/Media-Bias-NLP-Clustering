Jim Ferlo doesn\u2019t want to spend any more time or money talking about privatizing Pennsylvania\u2019s state-controlled liquor stores.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s put this B.S. privatization to bed and bury it,\u201d the Allegheny County Democrat said, calling it \u201cbaloney\u201d to think there\u2019d be a better selection of wines in private system.\n\nThough Gov. Tom Corbett isn\u2019t counting on money from privatizing the state-controlled liquor stores to balance his next budget, the issue of privatization hung heavy over Wednesday\u2019s state Senate Appropriations Committee meeting with the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board.\n\nFerlo said the debate might not end until November, which carries the assumption that Corbett won\u2019t win a second term. Until then, the issue looks like it will linger.\n\nWhen considering \u201cunfinished business\u201d during his budget address, Corbett focused more on pension reform than privatizing the state stores \u2014 though he argued that New Jersey, Delaware and Maryland pick up business from people who want more convenience and a reprieve from \u201cmonopoly prices.\u201d\n\nThat costs the state about $80 million each year, the governor said in his speech, saying 2014 should be the \u201clast call\u201d for state-controlled liquor.\n\nState Rep. Joe Markosek, the minority chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, said he\u2019s not sure how hard Corbett will push state-store privatization, but noted there\u2019s less support for it in the Legislature now than a year ago.\n\n\u201cIt was tried once and it failed,\u201d Markosek, D-Allegheny, said. \u201cI think members want to move on. They have other things on their plates.\u201d\n\nNo matter what, it\u2019s clear the state stores play a role in Pennsylvania\u2019s fiscal health.\n\nThe proposed budget includes an $80 million influx from the state stores, and PLCB Chairman Joseph \u201cSkip\u201d Brion said that figure could be increased to as much as $100 million.\n\nCorbett\u2019s privatization plan, which fell apart last year, would have phased out the more than 600 state-controlled liquor stores, while auctioning off up to 1,200 private liquor licenses. A revenue boost of $600 million to $1 billion was expected.\n\nMany Democratic lawmakers, though, argue state stores are an important asset better fated for modernization than privatization, which they say could jeopardize thousands of unionized state jobs.\n\nThe PLCB already has taken steps to improve convenience, including moving stores closer to grocery stores in hopes of attracting people who don\u2019t want to crisscross town to do all their shopping, Brion said.\n\nStores that have been relocated have seen big sales bumps, PLCB Board Member Robert Marcus said.\n\n\u201cCan we do better? Yes. We\u2019re trying to do better,\u201d Brion said.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean there wasn\u2019t troubling fiscal news from the Liquor Control Board.\n\nSo far, the state has received only six applications from taverns hoping to run small games of chance. That\u2019s a big problem, considering Corbett\u2019s budget banks on $102 million in tax revenue from the expanding gaming.\n\nSenate Appropriations Committee Chairman Jake Corman, R-Centre, said he\u2019s heard complaints about an onerous application process that needs to be addressed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s making Obamacare look robust back in November,\u201d he said, referring to the botched rollout of President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law.\n\nFerlo targeted a different chief executive when he spoke up about the dearth of applicants.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, our illustrious governor and his administration handed us a budget that is replete with imaginary figures and money that just does not exist and is not going to materialize,\u201d Ferlo said. \u201cAnd nowhere is that more clear than in the issue of the so-called small games of chance for the taverns.\u201d\n\nFerlo would like to see the law allowing small games of chance in taverns repealed, just as he wants to see the discussion about privatization disappear.\n\nWhile Corman said he\u2019s comfortable with either privatization or modernization, Brion just wants to focus on running the state stores even as legislators leave their future in limbo.\n\nBrion wasn\u2019t about to argue for or against privatization, adding he didn\u2019t want to lose sight of other agency responsibilities such as licensing and promoting responsible drinking.\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t all about profits,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about other things as a government agency.\u201d\n\nAndrew Staub is a reporter for PA Independent and can be reached at Andrew@PAIndependent.com.
