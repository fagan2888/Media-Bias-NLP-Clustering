NEW YORK (MainStreet) — Arrogance and a sense of self-importance might impress some people at the office park, but it won’t get you long-term respect from employees. A recent study by Arizona State University shows that humble CEOs who are more self-aware and open to feedback inspire more positive reactions from their staff. If you want to get more out of your employees, it’s time to let your own needs take a back seat.

“Humble people focus on promoting the welfare of others. This translates into commitment and engagement from employees, which translates into more positive work attitudes and higher performance,” says Angelo Kinicki, who performed the study and is a professor of management at the W. P. Carey School of Business at Arizona State.

The concept of “servant leadership” is nothing new, but more companies are starting to embrace it for its effectiveness building and maintaining the motivation of a team. Humble leadership creates a trusting work environment where employees thrive, says Janet Flewelling, managing director of service operations at HR firm Insperity.

“Servant leadership demonstrates maturity, level-headedness and fosters an atmosphere of teamwork in the workplace,” she says. “When bosses operate from a position that promotes and uplifts team members while proving they are imperative to the success of the company as a whole, those team members are motivated to deliver.”

Employees want to work hard for an organization that genuinely cares about them and recognizes their efforts, Flewelling says. An effective boss is one who appreciates the hard work of others and gives credit where credit is due.
