That\u2019s what we tell folks in Washington.\u201d\n\nHaving grown up in a banking family in Omaha, Jetter joined the FHLBank in Topeka in 1987 as an attorney and then was promoted to general counsel two years later. In the 1990s, he rose through the management ranks and was chosen as the bank\u2019s leader in 2002, just the fifth president since the Federal Home Loan Bank system was created in 1932 when Chester Sterling was the Topeka location\u2019s first leader.\n\nTopeka is home to one of 12 federal home loan banks that have their own boards of directors. They operate independently of one another but are aligned with the U.S. government and are subject to a high level of regulation.\n\nPresident Herbert Hoover signed the Federal Home Loan Bank Act in 1932 to try to pull the country out of the Great Depression. The legislation created the home loan bank system that would help thrift institutions provide home loans to the middle class.\n\n\u201cOnly the wealthy bought homes (for cash) as commercial banks didn\u2019t make home loans then,\u201d Jetter said. \u201cThrift institutions were the only significant source of financing for the middle class to buy homes and the Federal Home Loan Banks were created to help the thrift institutions.\u201d\n\nOver the past 82 years, the home loan banks have evolved to provide the same access to funding and capital to banks so they can invest in their communities, providing small business loans and economic development funds as part of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989.\n\n\u201cIn today\u2019s economy, retail financial institutions can\u2019t rely solely on consumer deposits to fund their operations,\u201d according to background information provided, \u201cand many turn to FHLBank Topeka for supplemental funding.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are a major, major player in liquidity funding for community banks,\u201d said Julie DeVader, vice president for marketing and communications for FHLBank Topeka. \u201cWe are a bank for banks.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Federal Home Loan Bank has always worked behind the scenes,\u201d Jetter added.\n\nOther federal home loan banks are scattered across the country, but Charles Curtis, a Topeka native and Hoover\u2019s vice president, wanted the capital city to have a federal home loan bank that would serve Kansas, Oklahoma, Nebraska and Colorado.\n\n\u201cIt was because of Charles,\u201d DeVader said. \u201cHe basically said, \u2018I want one in my hometown.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe first location was in the former First National Bank building at 6th and Kansas Avenue, later moving to Town Site Plaza at 6th and Quincy and then to the west side of Topeka in 2002 where it is located on the Security Benefit campus.\n\nIn the four-state region, the bank started with just six employees and several million dollars from the U.S. Treasury. It has since grown to 210 employees, $33.3 billion in assets and $1.5 billion in capital. In addition to community banks, the FHLBank serves credit unions, savings institution and insurance companies.\n\nAs part of its promotion of homeownership, FHLBank sets aside 10 percent of its annual earnings to provide funding for the Affordable Housing Program, or AHP, targeted at low and low-moderate income individuals, DeVader said. She said the program helps member banks provide funding for projects such as new housing for seniors, rental housing for persons with disabilities, the rehabilitation of vacant, single family homes and commercial property and improvements to public housing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great outreach,\u201d DeVader said. \u201cThe stories are incredible.\u201d\n\nWith affordable homeownership remaining as its core mission, Jetter said the federal home loan bank system has been able to evolve and be resilient through changes in the banking industry and several downturns in the economy since 1932. He said that is because the FHLBank has been a stable source of funding for community banks through the savings and loan crisis of the 1990s, the housing crisis of the Great Recession and now the ongoing consolidation of community banks in Kansas.\n\n\u201cFHLBank\u2019s capital can adjust to what our customer business needs are,\u201d Jetter said. \u201cWe can double in size and continue to be well-capitalized. We can grow and shrink by whatever is going on (in the market).\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Business, News, Local, Angela Deines, Local business, Andy Jetter, Charles Curtis, Chester Sterling, Herbert Hoover, Julie DeVader", "og": {"site_name": "CJOnline.com", "description": "As an entity that is private but closely aligned with the U.S. government, the system of federal home loan banks in the U.S. has acted much like a silent partner in helping banks help their communities for the past 82 years.", "title": "Topeka's FHLBank one of 12 in country", "url": "http://cjonline.com/news/business/2014-10-11/topekas-fhlbank-one-12-country", "image": "http://cjonline.com/sites/default/files/13788211.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "As an entity that is private but closely aligned with the U.S. government, the system of federal home loan banks in the U.S. has acted much like a silent partner in helping banks help their communities for the past 82 years.\u201cWe\u2019re big fans of the community banks,\u201d said Andy Jetter, 58, president and CEO of Federal Home Loan Bank, or FHLBank, in Topeka. \u201cThey\u2019re the lifeblood of their communities.
