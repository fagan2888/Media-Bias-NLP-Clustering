Ashley Brady has been on a long road to recovery since losing her leg in an accident last year. At 26 years old, she has had to relearn how to walk and climb stairs using her prosthetic leg, which was no easy task during the snowy winter months. Luckily, Brady’s apartment complex finally designed a handicap spot this past Thursday to make getting around a little easier and safer. On Saturday, though, she got home to a handicap placard-less car sitting in her brand new spot.

Thinking the driver of the vehicle made an honest mistake in parking in a handicap spot, Brady left a note explaining her grievance on the car’s windshield. The response Brady received from her neighbor, whose identity has not been made public, was unlike anything she expected:

“Hey handicap! First, never place your hands on my car again! Second, honey you ain’t the only one with ‘struggles.’ You want pity go to a one leg support group! You messed with the wrong one! I don’t care what your note said shove it, but you touch my car again I will file a report, I am not playing! I let the office know the cry baby one leg touches my property I will cause trouble so go cry your struggles to someone who cares cause I’m walking away with both mine! -B***h.”

Brady’s sister decided to post the outrageous note on Facebook where it has currently garnered over 2,000 Likes and 2,000 Shares. While the identity of her irate neighbor remains anonymous, Brady has already filed a complaint with the Miamisburg Police Department while the apartment complex settles on the right course of action.
