I started just before the government shutdown in 2013 at a tea party rally at the U.S. Capitol. Politicians railed against the president and the Affordable Care Act \u2014 a show to get a sound bite into the next news cycle.\n\n\n\nFormer U.S. secretary of state and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton hosted a town hall in Derry, N.H., in January.\n\nSince then I have followed the political spin as it tilts its way to November. Donald Trump\u2019s entrance into the race, taking control of TV talking heads, making the media his press agent, is true Political Theater.\n\n\n\nAmerican businessman Donald Trump at the Conservative Political Action Conference in National Harbor, Md., in February 2015.\n\nAfter a Trump rally in Lowell, Mass., a father said to his sons, \u201cNow that was entertaining.\u201d His sons agreed, chiming in with their favorite lines from Trump\u2019s speech. In New Hampshire after Bernie Sanders gave a speech, he walked down the stage stairs, and when he saw photographers there he stopped and raised an arm in a power salute.\n\n\n\nRepublican Sen. Ted Cruz at the RedState Gathering in Atlanta in August.\n\n\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders at the 2016 New Hampshire Primary Student Convention in New Hampshire in January.\n\nI want to pull back the curtain and show these politicians as they really are. Even though they are in plain sight, they can hide behind words and carefully arranged imagery to project their vision of America. I am using my camera to cut through the staging of these moments and reveal the cold, naked ambition for power.\n\n\n\nRepublican presidential hopeful Jeb Bush attends a \u201cPolitics and Pie\u201d event in Concord, N.H., in April.\n\n\n\nCarly Fiorina is interviewed by Fox News at the RedState Gathering in Atlanta in August.\n\n\n\nNew Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) speaks at the RedState Gathering in Atlanta in August.\n\n\n\nA cutout of Republican Sen. Marco Rubio at the New Hampshire Primary Student Convention in New Hampshire in January.\n\nMark Peterson is an award winning photographer and regular contributor to Time, MSNBC, New York Magazine and Politico. @markpetersonpixs\n\nRELATED CONTENT:", "article_metadata": {"description": "On the road, backstage at events, the presidential candidates captured in plain sight.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "On the road, backstage at events, the presidential candidates captured in plain sight.", "title": "Political theater: A photographer cuts through the traditional campaign trappings", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2016/02/04/political-theater/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/style-blog/files/2016/02/h_14742553sm.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2016/02/04/political-theater/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "trump, fiorina, rubio, cruz, carson, hillary, clinton, sanders, bernie, ted, donald, marco, carly, jeb, bush, chris, christie", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "trump, fiorina, rubio, cruz, carson, hillary, clinton, sanders, bernie, ted, donald, marco, carly, jeb, bush, chris, christie"}, "article_summary": "Carly Fiorina is interviewed by Fox News at the RedState Gathering in Atlanta in August.\nChris Christie (R) speaks at the RedState Gathering in Atlanta in August.\nDonald Trump\u2019s entrance into the race, taking control of TV talking heads, making the media his press agent, is true Political Theater.\nA cutout of Republican Sen.
