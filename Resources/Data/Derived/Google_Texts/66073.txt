The State Election Board launched a new Online Voter Tool that will allow Oklahomans to look up their voter registration, polling location, sample ballots and check the status of their absentee ballots all in one location.

The Online Voter Tool is available at http://elections.ok.gov. According to officials, while the Oklahoma State Election Board's website has featured a polling place locator in the past, the enhanced tool also allows voters to view sample ballots for upcoming elections, track their absentee ballots and confirm their voter registration all in the same place.

"The new Online Voter Tool gives Oklahomans unprecedented online access to their voter information," said Oklahoma State Election Board Secretary Paul Ziriax. "We are especially happy to have this service up and running in time for the June 24 Primary Election."

Users can enter their name and birth date, and those who have successfully registered to vote will see their information. Those who are not registered will get an alert telling them to contact their county election board.

The tool includes a map showing the voter's polling location and links to sample ballots for upcoming elections in which they are eligible to vote. Those who have requested an absentee ballot can also see when the ballot was sent and received by their county election board.
