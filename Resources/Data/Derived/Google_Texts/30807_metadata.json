No\n\n1. What makes you qualified to do the job better than your opponent?\n\nI am an attorney and very active in the community. I am well known and will bring the kind of legal expertise sorely lacking on the current council. I am an Assistant Girl Scout Troop Leader and the Legal Counsel to the Monmouth Council for the Boy Scouts. I also sit on the board of the New Jersey Bar Foundation and run a holiday toy drive for the Division of Youth & Family Services on behalf of the Middlesex County Bar Foundation.\n\n2. What would you consider to be the single most important issue you\u2019ll face in office if victorious?\n\nI believe one area which the council needs to focus on is public safety. One of the first actions the current council took four years ago was to fire 10 police officers. Despite what the council claims, the move actually cost all Old Bridge taxpayers money while putting us at risk. We now have fewer officers on the job and as a result have seen a spike in bank robberies, home invasions, and break-ins. Public safety is a right not a budget item to be politicized.\n\n3. Why should voters trust you to do what you say you\u2019ll do?\n\nVoters can trust me because as I have no vested interest in serving \u2014 only the desire to help the community in which I was raised and, with my beautiful wife, am proud to be able to raise my children.
