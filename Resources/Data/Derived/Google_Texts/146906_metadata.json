On the the court, the Nuggets have to hope the things they accomplished prior to Sunday afternoon\u2019s 100-84 loss to Utah will be good enough.\n\nThe Jazz let the air out of the Pepsi Center by first taking the air out of the Nuggets\u2019 offense. As they had done three other times this season. Utah was the one team the Nuggets not only didn\u2019t beat, losing the season series 0-4, but couldn\u2019t even begin to solve.\n\nIn four games, the Jazz held the Nuggets to 84.2 points per game and never allowed the Nuggets more than 88 points in any of them. They ground the Nuggets offense to a halt every single time, and many times made it look frighteningly simple to do.\n\n\u201cYou get beat four times by a division opponent, there\u2019s no mixed or magical reason,\u201d Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. \u201cThey\u2019re a better team than us. They defend, we can\u2019t score against them\u2026they\u2019re right now ahead of us. They\u2019re on the cusp of making the playoffs and we\u2019re on the outside looking in.\u201d\n\nThe worst moment of the series came in the third quarter, when the Nuggets scoring dried up altogether. When Nikola Jokic made a bucket with 6:56 in the third, the Nuggets were up 62-58. Then, the Jazz put the screws to them on defense.\n\nThe Nugget did not score another point, and Utah sprinted past them using what became a 24-0 run to end the third. The Nuggets went 0-for-12 with four turnovers in the stretch.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s where the game was lost,\u201d Malone said. \u201cYou can\u2019t let a team go on that type of run where you don\u2019t get stops, you don\u2019t score, where you don\u2019t execute.\u201d\n\nThe drought stretched into the fourth quarter with the Nuggets missing their first two shots of that period, too. By the time Will Barton made a breakaway dunk with 10:28 in the fourth, the Nuggets had not scored in 8 minutes, 28 seconds of game time.\n\nAnd it was still a 24-2 run.\n\nThey never recovered and ended their home schedule the way it began \u2014 with a loss. The Nuggets finished their home schedule with an 18-23 record, one win shy of last season\u2019s 19. Establishing a home court edge was something the Nuggets desperately wanted to get to but never truly did.\n\nTheir best stretch was a 5-2 record in a seven-game homestand in March. But, in the end, it wasn\u2019t the turning point the Nuggets had hoped it would be. They finished with two wins in the final six home contests.\n\n\u201cI think 18-23 at home is poor. It\u2019s one less than they won last year so we took a step back in that area, which is disappointing,\u201d Malone said. \u201cIf you want to be a playoff-caliber team, if you want to be a competitive team, you have to protect your home court.\u201d\n\nRudy Gobert dominated the Nuggets front line on both ends, finishing with 16 points, 14 rebounds and a career-high six blocks.\n\nMeanwhile, the Nuggets did put five players into double figures, led by Nikola Jokic\u2019s 19 points and 11 rebounds. Emmanuel Mudiay finished with 19 points as well.\n\n\u201cThey did a better job of executing their plays in the second half,\u201d Mudiay said. \u201cThey kind of slowed us down.\u201d\n\nChristopher Dempsey: cdempsey@denverpost.com or @dempseypost", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Denver can\u2019t figure out Utah as Nuggets go 0-4 against Jazz", "title": "Denver can\u2019t figure out Utah as Nuggets go 0-4 against Jazz", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/04/10/denver-cant-figure-out-utah-as-nuggets-go-0-4-against-jazz/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160410__Nuggets_Jazz_Horizontalp1.jpg", "height": 453}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160410__Nuggets_Jazz_Horizontalp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-04-10T18:34:35+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T14:01:54+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The Nuggets finished their home schedule with an 18-23 record, one win shy of last season\u2019s 19.\nUtah was the one team the Nuggets not only didn\u2019t beat, losing the season series 0-4, but couldn\u2019t even begin to solve.\nIn four games, the Jazz held the Nuggets to 84.2 points per game and never allowed the Nuggets more than 88 points in any of them.\nThe Jazz let the air out of the Pepsi Center by first taking the air out of the Nuggets\u2019 offense.\n\u201cYou get beat four times by a division opponent, there\u2019s no mixed or magical reason,\u201d Nuggets coach Michael Malone said."}
