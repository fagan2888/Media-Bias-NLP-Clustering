Over five seasons in the 1990s as they were rising under Brett Favre and Reggie White, the Green Bay Packers lost to the Dallas Cowboys seven straight times, including three playoff games. All of the games were in Dallas. They finally broke through with a big victory at Lambeau Field in the 1997 season, which ended with a Super Bowl appearance. Today, the Packers have lost to the San Francisco 49ers three times in a row, including once in the playoffs.
