The Health Network has relationships with more than 140 practices in the Lehigh Valley.\n\nHe said patients of the merged physician groups will be notified of the change and about rescheduling appointments.\n\n\u201cThere will be minimal impact on patients other than going to another practice or service that\u2019s nearby,\u201d Downs said.\n\nLVHN is the largest employer in the Lehigh Valley with a payroll of 14,000 workers. In addition to Hazleton, the network has hospitals in Salisbury Township, Allentown and Bethlehem.\n\nIt also has a dozen health centers in five counties and numerous primary- and specialty-care physician practices in the region.\n\nLehigh Valley Physician Group is among the largest medical groups in the U.S., according to LVHN\u2019s website. More than 700 physicians and more than 300 advanced clinicians represent 47 medical specialties in the affiliated practices.\n\nLVPG practitioners perform about 2 million visits annually in practices, hospitals and other affiliated locations.\n\nIn its most recent IRS Form 990 filing for Lehigh Valley Physician Group, from July 1, 2013, to June 30, 2014, the physician group recorded revenue of\n\n$412.5 million and expenses of $424.5 million \u2014 a deficit of nearly $12 million.\n\nIn the statement, LVHN says: \u201cWhile more patients than ever are using Lehigh Valley Physician Group and our outpatient services overall, we have an opportunity to consolidate LVPG practices where there are multiple practices nearby. These factors have resulted in changes to our workforce.\n\n\u201cThe number of staff affected by these changes is small, but every single individual is a colleague and is important to us. We are working with each person affected by the changes and anticipate the majority of them will remain with LVHN in different capacities.\u201d\n\nThe statement ends by saying LVHN will continue to make \u201cperiodic adjustments\u201d based on market needs and local and national trends in health care.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, Downs said the matter is related to the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, in the area of \u201cfee for service versus fee for value,\u201d and government reimbursements from Medicare and Medicaid.\n\n\u201cIn the past, the government paid for all you did,\u201d Downs said. \u201cNow we get paid in a bundle payment and this is it, all based on value.\u201d\n\nExperts generally agreed with LVHN\u2019s premise about the change in government payouts for health care in the overall rising cost of health care.\n\n\u201cA lot of change is going on that is forcing health systems to consolidate, redefine how medicine is being delivered,\u201d said Tom Croyle, president of the Lehigh Valley Business Coalition on Healthcare.\n\nCroyle said Medicaid typically pays below the cost of services, while Medicare\u2019s payouts are based on employer groups and individual insurance coverage.\n\nLehigh Valley Health Network\u2019s 2015 fiscal year \u2014 its second full fiscal year under the Affordable Care Act \u2014 ended June 30 with revenue of $1.9 billion, 13 percent higher than the year before. Operating income, the difference between day-to-day income and expenses, surged\n\n$30 million \u2014 72 percent \u2014 to $72 million.\n\nLVHN intends to merge later this year with Pocono Health System, which includes Pocono Medical Center in East Stroudsburg.\n\nStaff writer Kent Jackson contributed to this report.\n\nasalamone@mcall.com", "article_metadata": {"author": "By Anthony Salamone of The Morning Call", "title": "LVHN consolidation has no impact in Greater Hazleton", "robots": "ACAP allow-index", "DC.creator": "By Anthony Salamone of The Morning Call", "tout": {"article": {"id": "1.1995152"}}, "keywords": "Local", "DC.subject": "Local", "DC.title": "LVHN consolidation has no impact in Greater Hazleton"}, "article_summary": "No workers in Greater Hazleton or at Lehigh Valley Hospital-Hazleton will be affected, network spokesman Brian Downs said.\nLehigh Valley Physician Group is among the largest medical groups in the U.S., according to LVHN\u2019s website.\nLVHN is the largest employer in the Lehigh Valley with a payroll of 14,000 workers.\nThe Health Network has relationships with more than 140 practices in the Lehigh Valley.\nIt also has a dozen health centers in five counties and numerous primary- and specialty-care physician practices in the region."}
