WILMINGTON, NC (WWAY) — As he fights to get his old job back, Cape Fear Community College’s former president looks ready to find a new home.

According to real estate listings, Ted Spring’s house in Wilmington went on the market June 26 with an asking price of $498,000. An updated listing for the home obtained by WWAY shows the five-bedroom, four-bathroom house on Winforde Road went under contract July 17.

Records show Spring and his wife Andrea bought the 3,381-square-foot home in July 2013 for $479,000.

Spring resigned from CFCC in January. He later sued the school’s Board of Trustees for his job back plus legal fees claiming trustees forced him out improperly.

Today the Office of the State Auditor released a report of an investigative audit that was critical of Spring’s spending as president, including using more than $35,000 in discretionary funds for personal expenses.

Spring’s attorney has not returned calls for comment.
