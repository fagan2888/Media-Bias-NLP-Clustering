Rep. Mike Coffman, R-Colo., on Wednesday introduced legislation that would tie the completion of the project to employee bonuses, prohibiting the department from awarding them until the facility is finished and fully operational. That is slated to happen in 2017.\n\n\u201cThe Aurora VA hospital is approximately $900 million underfunded and 2.5 years from completion,\u201d wrote Coffman spokesman Tyler Sandberg by email. \u201cWith the bonuses suspended for 2.5 years at $360 million per year that gets us to exactly $900 million, which means the hospital can be finished in a deficit-neutral manner.\u201d The Aurora facility originally was supposed to be done by May 2015 at a cost of $630 million. It is now on track to cost the government a total of $1.73 billion.\n\nVA has $360 million authorized for bonuses in fiscal 2015; however, the department is the second largest in the federal government with more than 300,000 employees. Between fiscal years 2012 and 2013, VA reduced the average amount of individual performance awards for its career senior executives from $12,010 to $9,159. Of its 346 career senior executives in fiscal 2013, about 63 percent received a performance award.\n\n\u201cRather than improving the quality of VA health care, bonus money has fueled corruption by incentivizing the sort of misconduct which led to the ongoing \u2018secret waiting list\u2019 scandal,\u201d Coffman said in a statement.\n\nGlenn Haggstrom, the former senior executive in charge of construction nationwide at VA, retired from the department effective March 25. In a statement, VA officials said the problems with the construction of the Aurora medical center were \u201cunacceptable\u201d and that Haggstrom \u201chad recently been relieved of any decision-making in the Office of Construction and Facilities Management.\u201d\n\nHaggstrom, who earned an annual salary of $181,497 in 2014 according to a federal pay database, reportedly earned nearly $64,000 in bonuses since 2007. As of Thursday, it appeared that the VA had taken down Haggstrom\u2019s online bio on the department\u2019s website. Assistant Secretary for Operations, Security, and Preparedness Kevin Hanretta will oversee VA\u2019s Office of Acquisition, Logistics, and Construction until the department finds a permanent replacement.\n\nHaggstrom retired with his full retirement benefit, which angered some members of Congress.\n\n\u201cThough Glenn Haggstrom may have tried to do a good job at VA, he certainly did not succeed,\u201d said House Veterans\u2019 Affairs Committee Chairman Rep. Jeff Miller, R-Fla. \u201cWhat\u2019s most disappointing about this situation, however, is that Haggstrom left on his own terms \u2013 with a lifetime pension \u2013 even though any reasonable person would conclude that he should have been fired years ago.\u201d\n\nThe House earlier this month passed a bill designed to address similar situations, by giving the VA secretary the authority to claw back bonuses of employees found to have engaged in misconduct. The legislation does not specify criteria that would be grounds for ordering a repayment, giving the secretary broad discretion.\n\nIn addition to the bonus ban until the Aurora facility is open for business, Coffman\u2019s bill would increase the current spending cap on the project -- $880 million \u2013 to enable the Army Corps of Engineers to complete construction. The Army Corps of Engineers last week took over the project from VA. Coffman\u2019s legislation also would prohibit the VA from building medical facilities costing more than $10 million in the future, and would put the Army Corps of Engineers in charge of those projects.\n\nAnother provision directs the Government Accountability Office to review VA\u2019s internal investigation into the Aurora project, requiring the watchdog \u201cto establish when senior VA officials knew about the excessive cost overruns and the reasons that information was withheld from Congress,\u201d according to Coffman\u2019s press release.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Kellie Lunney", "description": "Colorado Republican introduces bill tying employee bonuses to the completion of the new Aurora VA hospital.", "og": {"site_name": "Government Executive", "description": "Colorado Republican introduces bill tying employee bonuses to the completion of the new Aurora VA hospital.", "title": "Lawmaker Wants to Ban All VA Bonuses Until Troubled Construction Project is Finished", "url": "http://www.govexec.com/pay-benefits/2015/03/lawmaker-wants-ban-all-va-bonuses-until-troubled-construction-project-finished/108568/", "image": "http://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2015/03/26/032615coffman.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Colorado Republican introduces bill tying employee bonuses to the completion of the new Aurora VA hospital.", "creator": "@klunney", "image": "http://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2015/03/26/032615coffman/open-graph.jpg", "title": "Lawmaker Wants to Ban All VA Bonuses Until Troubled Construction Project is Finished", "site": "@govexec", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-03-26T20:17:08Z", "sailthru.images.full": "http://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2015/03/26/032615coffman.jpg", "sailthru.title": "Lawmaker Wants to Ban All VA Bonuses Until Troubled Construction Project is Finished", "keywords": "va mismanagement, va scandal, bonuses, executive bonuses", "fb": {"admins": 578600878}, "sailthru.images.thumb": "http://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2015/03/26/032615coffman/sailthru-thumbnail.jpg", "sailthru.tags": "va-mismanagement,channel-pay-&-benefits,type-story,length-medium,site-govexec", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/GovernmentExecutive"}, "sailthru.description": "Colorado Republican introduces bill tying employee bonuses to the completion of the new Aurora VA hospital."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe42ef\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe Aurora VA hospital is approximately $900 million underfunded and 2.5 years from completion,\u201d wrote Coffman spokesman Tyler Sandberg by email.\nGlenn Haggstrom, the former senior executive in charge of construction nationwide at VA, retired from the department effective March 25.\nRepublicans and Democrats are outraged over the troubled construction of a new VA medical facility in Aurora, a project that\u2019s been beset by schedule delays and is hundreds of millions of dollars over budget.\nVA has $360 million authorized for bonuses in fiscal 2015; however, the department is the second largest in the federal government with more than 300,000 employees.\nA new House bill would prohibit the Veterans Affairs Department from awarding any bonuses until a nearly $2 billion VA hospital in Colorado is up and running."}
