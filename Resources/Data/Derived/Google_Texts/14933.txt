Abdullah Alkhuzai was tortured by Saddam Hussein and his henchmen back in the early '90s. He fled to Pittsburgh and now, his parents are here as well.

It was a reunion more than two decades in the making. For the first time in 23 years, Alkhuzai hugged his father and cried with this mother. He was overwhelmed with joy, love, heartache, Sunday evening, at Pittsburgh International Airport, as he saw them for the first time since he left Iraq.

"Honest to god, like the truth, I don't have no words in the dictionary to explain how happy I am," Alkhuzai said.

In Iraq, he was tortured under Saddam Hussein's rule, he says, beaten, stabbed, and starved in prison.

Alkhuzai fled to the United States in 1994 and 10 years later, he made national headlines when a federal court awarded him $88 million after he sued Saddam and his two sons.

It was a turning point in Alkhuzai's life, but he says the happiness he felt then doesn't compare to today.

"Right now I feel life is complete. Especially my city of Pittsburgh. I feel like it's my hometown because my mom and my dad they are with me," he said.

It's a day his wife wasn't sure she'd ever see.

"It just means everything that his dream came true for him. This meant everything for him," said Christine Alkhuzai.

Now this reunited family looks forward to building a life together in Pittsburgh.

"Just spending time with them and seeing my husband reunite. Just starting a new chapter in his life," she said.

Alkhuzai's parents will be staying here in the U.S. for good. His wife says Congressman Mike Doyle helped get them here after Alkhuzai's three brothers were also killed in Iraq.
