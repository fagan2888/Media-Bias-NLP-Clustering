For a second time this season, OKC Energy FC and Tulsa Roughnecks FC played to a draw, 1-1 Saturday night at Taft Stadium. OKC's Danni König netted his league-leading 14th goal of the season

After a scoreless first half, Tulsa struck first when Brady Ballew took a lead pass from Oscar Jimenez near the goal line on the right side of the OKC net and chipped a steep-angle shot into the top-left corner, just out of reach of Energy FC keeper Evan Newton.

OKC tied the score in the 61st minute when König was hauled down in the Tulsa box and awarded a penalty kick. On the ensuing shot, König blasted the ball past a diving Roughnecks keeper Jake Feener to knot the score at one. The goal was König's seventh in eight games, with the forward accounting for Energy FC's last five goals.

Despite an intense match that saw three cautions issued to each team, neither Tulsa nor OKC was able to muster a go-ahead score in the game's closing minutes.

With the tie, Energy FC wins the season series against Tulsa, recently named the Black Gold Derby by OKC supporters group The Grid and Roughnecks backers the Roustabouts. OKC captain Michael Thomas received the Wrench award in a ceremony following the match. Though the teams meet again in Tulsa on Sept. 6, OKC clinched the season series with a 2-0 win at Taft Stadium on June 13 and a win in U.S. Open Cup play on May 27 in Tulsa. The teams played to a 1-1 draw in the season opener on March 28.

Energy FC next travels to St. Louis, Mo., where it faces Saint Louis FC in a 7 p.m. start on Saturday, July 25 at World Wide Technology Soccer Park.

OKC's next home match is Friday, July 31, when the club welcomes Arizona United SC for a 7 p.m. match at Taft Stadium.
