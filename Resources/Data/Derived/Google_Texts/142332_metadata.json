(APPLAUSE) Before lifting those restrictions, the world should demand that Iran do three things. First, stop its aggression against its neighbors in the Middle East. Second\u2026 (APPLAUSE) Second, stop supporting terrorism around the world. (APPLAUSE) And third, stop threatening to annihilate my country, Israel, the one and only Jewish state.\n\nObama claimed at the time not to have watched the speech, but said he read the transcript, so he is aware of Netanyahu\u2019s alternative.\n\nIn addition, others have suggested alternatives. Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) presented one, for example, on Thursday, in announcing his opposition to the Iran deal: \u201cBetter to keep U.S. sanctions in place, strengthen them, enforce secondary sanctions on other nations, and pursue the hard-trodden path of diplomacy once more, difficult as it may be.\u201d Zakaria\u2019s interview with Obama occurred on the same day.\n\nZakaria also invited Obama to attack Netanyahu:", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Barack Obama claimed that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had offered no alternative to the Iran deal.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "President Barack Obama claimed that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had offered no alternative to the Iran deal.", "title": "Iran Deal: Obama Says 'No Alternative' from Netanyahu", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/06/obama_netanyahu-Jim-Young-Reuters.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/08/09/iran-deal-obama-says-no-alternative-from-netanyahu/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "President Barack Obama claimed that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had offered no alternative to the Iran deal.", "creator": "@joelpollak", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/06/obama_netanyahu-Jim-Young-Reuters.jpg", "title": "Iran Deal: Obama Says 'No Alternative' from Netanyahu", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Fareed Zakaria, fareed zakaria gps, iran deal, iran nuclear, israel injected, obama iran, obama netanyahu,Big Government, Big Journalism, National Security,Iran Deal", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-08-09T07:49:49-07:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/joelpollak", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "obama netanyahu", "categories": "Big Government,National Security,Big Journalism"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERPresident Barack Obama claimed Sunday that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had offered no alternative to the Iran deal.\nSecond\u2026 (APPLAUSE) Second, stop supporting terrorism around the world.\nObama claimed at the time not to have watched the speech, but said he read the transcript, so he is aware of Netanyahu\u2019s alternative.\nIn the interview, taped after Obama\u2019s Iran speech last week, Obama also reiterated that it was \u201cabsolutely true factually\u201d that Republicans had made \u201ccommon cause\u201d with hardliners in Iran.\nZakaria also invited Obama to attack Netanyahu:"}
