We\u2019re going to repeal and replace Obamacare, which is a total disaster\u201d in response to an ad by fellow candidate former Florida Governor Jeb Bush criticizing Trump\u2019s position on healthcare among other issues on Tuesday\u2019s \u201cSean Hannity Show.\u201d\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nTrump stated that he \u201cgot along with all politicians\u201d and that he had an \u201cobligation\u201d to his company as a businessman to get along with all politicians. He continued, \u201cSupposing, for instance, you didn\u2019t get along with the Clintons and they\u2019re in high positions of power, and I need things done over the years, you know, you go back to them two, three years later, and they don\u2019t like you because you were never nice to them, or you fought them. Again, I wasn\u2019t a politician until three months ago, Sean, I just turned politician three months ago.\u201d\n\nHe further dismissed the ad as \u201cvery old hat.\u201d He also said that he changed his position on abortion after knowing people who chose not to abort their child. He also pointed out that New York is heavily Democratic and \u201cif you\u2019re not a Democrat, you\u2019re like \u2014 what are you doing? Again, I was a businessperson. It was important that I get along with everybody. I got all \u2014 everything I ever wanted.\u201d\n\nAfter host Sean Hannity said, \u201cyou said to me you don\u2019t support a single-payer system, you said after you did some research, you support healthcare savings accounts,\u201d Trump concluded by saying, \u201cBut the other thing \u2014 and two things,\u201d before discussing his past tax positions. Once he got to healthcare, he stated, \u201cAs far as single-payer and all \u2014 there\u2019s so many different things you could have. Honestly, Sean, to do, to have great health insurance. The one thing I do tell people, we\u2019re going to have something great. We\u2019re going to repeal and replace Obamacare, which is a total disaster. Well, Sean, look at what\u2019s happening with the premiums, okay. Look at what\u2019s happening to deductibles, I mean you can die and never even see your health insurance because you didn\u2019t spend enough money trying to save yourself.\u201d\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett", "article_metadata": {"description": "Donald Trump stated, \"As far as single-payer and all -- there's so many different things you could have\" on healthcare", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Donald Trump stated, \"As far as single-payer and all -- there's so many different things you could have\" on healthcare", "title": "Trump on Healthcare: 'As Far As Single-Payer And All - There's So Many Different Things You Could Have' - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/08/donald-trump-points-it-out-AP.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2015/09/01/trump-on-healthcare-as-far-as-single-payer-and-all-theres-so-many-different-things-you-could-have/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Donald Trump stated, \"As far as single-payer and all -- there's so many different things you could have\" on healthcare", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/08/donald-trump-points-it-out-AP.jpg", "title": "Trump on Healthcare: 'As Far As Single-Payer And All - There's So Many Different Things You Could Have' - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Donald Trump, healthcare, single-payer healthcare,2016 Presidential Race, Breitbart TV, Obamacare,Trump", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "single-payer healthcare", "published_time": "2015-09-01T18:32:52-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart TV,2016 Presidential Race,Obamacare"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce212\"", "article_summary": "Once he got to healthcare, he stated, \u201cAs far as single-payer and all \u2014 there\u2019s so many different things you could have.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump stated, \u201cAs far as single-payer and all \u2014 there\u2019s so many different things you could have\u201d and \u201cwe\u2019re going to have something great.\nHe also pointed out that New York is heavily Democratic and \u201cif you\u2019re not a Democrat, you\u2019re like \u2014 what are you doing?\nWell, Sean, look at what\u2019s happening with the premiums, okay.\nThe one thing I do tell people, we\u2019re going to have something great."}
