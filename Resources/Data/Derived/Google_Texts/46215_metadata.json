BuzzFeed, a site that uses native ads that look like its own articles, is accusing the New York Observer of running Russian propaganda.\n\nThe New York Observer is standing by a reporter who has written more than a dozen articles for the outlet with a slavishly pro-Kremlin bent, the most recent a story with no sources that blames the murder of opposition leader Boris Nemtsov on his love life. The reporter, Mikhail Klikushin, has written 15 articles for the outlet since November 2014, according to the Observer\u2019s website. He has no online presence \u2014 in English or Russian \u2014 beyond the stories he has written for the Observer, which have also been picked up by other outlets. A Nexis search turns up no public record of Klikushin.\n\nWhile that kind of thing is standard propaganda, BuzzFeed was just responsible for an ObamaCare promotional video in which Obama goofs around with a selfie stick.\n\nAs far as \"slavish bents\" go, BuzzFeed is far worse.\n\nIts article sourcing is even more dubious because it's hard to tell its ads apart from its community posts from its articles, and that's without even mentioning its plagiarism problem.\n\nThis comes down to a slap fight between a government propaganda network and a propaganda guy for a foreign government. That might normally not be too hard of a choice what with my country right or wrong, but Obama doesn't represent the country. Like Putin, he's a rogue figure dedicated to his own power and agenda.\n\nThe cited Klikushin piece may be terrible, but New York Magazine still has posts up claiming that Hamas didn't kill the Israeli teens. The content is equally dishonest and trashy. The difference is that one of them is politically correct. The other isn't.\n\nEven the argument that Putin is an enemy seems weak. When the Washington Post can run a post sympathizing with ISIS and suggesting that its rapists and murderers are the real victims, anything goes.", "article_metadata": {"rating": "general", "description": "Pot meets kettle", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Frontpage Mag", "description": "Pot meets kettle", "title": "Obama's BuzzFeed Propagandists Accuse NY Observer of Putin Propaganda", "url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/point/252406/obamas-buzzfeed-propagandists-accuse-ny-observer-daniel-greenfield", "updated_time": "2015-06-22T23:41:51-04:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/point/252406/obamas-buzzfeed-propagandists-accuse-ny-observer-daniel-greenfield", "description": "Pot meets kettle", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama's BuzzFeed Propagandists Accuse NY Observer of Putin Propaganda"}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-03T03:28:36-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-22T23:41:51-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccff6\"", "article_summary": "BuzzFeed, a site that uses native ads that look like its own articles, is accusing the New York Observer of running Russian propaganda.\nWhile that kind of thing is standard propaganda, BuzzFeed was just responsible for an ObamaCare promotional video in which Obama goofs around with a selfie stick.\nThis comes down to a slap fight between a government propaganda network and a propaganda guy for a foreign government.\nThe reporter, Mikhail Klikushin, has written 15 articles for the outlet since November 2014, according to the Observer\u2019s website.\nHe has no online presence \u2014 in English or Russian \u2014 beyond the stories he has written for the Observer, which have also been picked up by other outlets."}
