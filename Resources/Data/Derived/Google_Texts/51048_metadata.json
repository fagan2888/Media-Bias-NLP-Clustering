He intended to stay a few years, then strike out on his own. But he found that he loved it there. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nI wish the subject of this week\u2019s column existed before I underwent a root canal a decade ago.\n\nThe dentist attacked the wrong tooth. He found the correct one a few days later, after I returned feeling like Mike Tyson had KO\u2019d me.\n\nMedical mistakes: B-Line Medical is about catching them before they happen.\n\nThe company, nestled in a corner building a block off Dupont Circle, sells kits to medical and nursing schools so educators can film future doctors and nurses practicing on people or on wired-up dummies.\n\n\u201cWhen doctors and nurses are learning, they perform exercises with people pretending to be sick and mannequins that can do everything a human can do,\u201d said B-Line Medical President Hartley Thompson. \u201cThey have to practice routinely so they don\u2019t harm the real patients. We provide video equipment that records those interactions.\u201d\n\n\n\nEducators use the recordings, from B-Line\u2019s \u201cSimCapture\u201d platform, as a teaching aid. A faculty member might use the software to check on whether students identified themselves to the patient, when they washed their hands and how they delivered good or bad news.\n\n\u201cBefore, a professor or faculty member would have to stand in the room with a notepad,\u201d said Thompson. \u201cNow they can sit at home, watch in real time while the student is practicing and fill out the evaluation from the laptop.\u201d\n\nB-Line Medical products come in a briefcase \u2014 \u201cthe black box\u201d \u2014 containing a laptop, portable cameras with microphones and a data-capture device. There also is a non-portable unit that can connect to cameras, microphones and gadgets already installed in a hospital or a simulation room and relay them to the Internet.\n\nB-Line Medical\u2019s 500 clients across 24 countries include most of the premier U.S. medical schools, such as Harvard and the University of Pennsylvania. Around Washington, George Washington University, Georgetown and Johns Hopkins Medical Schools are B-Line Medical customers.\n\nThat\u2019s only half the business.\n\nB-Line Medical also sells a platform called \u201cLiveCapture.\u201d That involves filming doctors and nurses caring for patients. Hospitals using B-Line Medical can document events including operating-room activities, emergencies and routine hospital-room visits. The idea is to use the system to spot trouble and improve care.\n\nMayo Clinic in Minnesota, the Cleveland Clinic, the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia and Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston are among its customers.\n\nThe hard part is persuading medical staff to allow the cameras. Honestly, I cannot imagine a camera recording my interviews and listening in.\n\nThompson said that the Affordable Care Act prevents the use of the recordings in lawsuits, which helps allay physicians\u2019 concerns. Hospitals can also institute procedures that protect physicians and nurses.\n\nAs for patient permission, Thompson said that most hospital patient-consent forms include a paragraph that informs people that their treatment is subject to being recorded.\n\nB-Line Medical was founded in 2005 and has about 70 employees. It grossed well over $10 million last year, with a profit margin of 30 percent. About 80 percent of the business is in the United States. Most of the rest is in Australia, Saudi Arabia and South Korea.\n\nB-Line has no debt, is cash positive and was founded by Chafic Kazoun and Lucas Huang.\n\nIts products sell for $12,000 to $30,000 per unit, depending on the complexity. The more expensive the system, the more that instructors can accomplish. Some allow greater interaction with students, providing feedback, creating reports and debriefing classes. The LiveCapture model sells for around $30,000.\n\nThe average sale is about $100,000, Thompson said.\n\nOne of the most attractive parts of the business is its recurring revenue stream. About 93 percent of B-Line Medical\u2019s customers have signed up for technology support. The support contract is priced at from 15 to 20 percent of the product\u2019s price. So people who buy a $12,000 unit might pay $1,800 a year for the ability to summon B-Line Medical\u2019s support team any time of the day or night. Thompson said that 99 percent of customers signing up renew those contracts.\n\nThompson grew up in the Bahamas, in Freeport. His easygoing nature belies his ambition. His parents pushed him early on to learn the importance of money and entre\u00adpre\u00adneur\u00adship.\n\nHis father has started various businesses. His mother owns an event-planning company.\n\n\u201cMy dad really pushed me and my brothers to go out and make your own money,\u201d he said. \u201cAt 8 years old, we started a window-washing and car-washing business.\u201d\n\n\u201cI fell in love with just providing a service to somebody and a product and actually getting paid for it,\u201d he said.\n\nHe attended Liberty University in Lynchburg, Va., on scholarship, graduating with a degree in management information systems.\n\nThompson joined B-Line Medical in 2007 as employee No. 12. The company was 18 months old. He found the job on CareerBuilder.com.\n\n\u201cWe were not making money when I got here,\u201d he said. \u201cLike any start-up, we were having lean days. Some bills didn\u2019t get paid.\u201d\n\nThompson\u2019s plan was to get experience, then start his own company in a few years. But he loved B-Line.\n\n\u201cI just showed a passion for the business and a hunger to take on more responsibility and keep learning,\u201d said Thompson, who has a master\u2019s degree in information management from the University of Maryland.\n\nB-Line\u2019s breakthrough came when its technology was purchased by Washington University in St. Louis and by Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.\n\n\u201cWhen we landed those two, things started snowballing,\u201d Thompson said.\n\nRevenue jumped from the single-digit millions in 2009 to nearly $10 million in 2010 and is well beyond that now. Last year, the company\u2019s revenue grew around 30 percent.\n\nWith a limited number of U.S. medical schools, the company\u2019s biggest challenge is to expand revenue by coming up with new products. That includes upgrading old units and adding new options. There are also applications for B-Line technology in the legal, law enforcement and pharmaceutical training areas.\n\nThe company is in 130 of the 170 or so accredited medical schools in the United States.\n\n\u201cThe biggest challenge is coming up with ways to innovate,\u201d said Thompson. \u201cThere are a lot of new simulators coming out, and we want B-Line to be the hub for all of that data. That could hopefully lead to stronger revenue.\u201d\n\nThompson takes me through the product development center. It is eerily quiet, a dimly lit and carpeted room with dark walls, where the product engineers \u2014 \u201cthe talent\u201d \u2014 are working on creating B-Line\u2019s next big breakthrough.\n\nWe pass a six-foot-high \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d castle, which says to me that I am among the techies.\n\n\u201cWe give people a mission, and we really like to have fun,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cIf you\u2019re not having fun at work, there\u2019s no point in coming.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "business, Value Added, capbiztopnews", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "A District technology company creates teachable moments by filming practice and real-life medicine.", "title": "That knee replacement you just underwent might make it onscreen", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/that-knee-replacement-you-just-underwent-might-make-it-onscreen/2016/01/17/6d192e1e-baef-11e5-b682-4bb4dd403c7d_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/01/14/Local/Images/Botsford_valueAdded_16_01_14_01571452791111.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@addedvalueth"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/that-knee-replacement-you-just-underwent-might-make-it-onscreen/2016/01/17/6d192e1e-baef-11e5-b682-4bb4dd403c7d_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "business, Value Added, capbiztopnews", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "eomportal-uuid": "6d192e1e-baef-11e5-b682-4bb4dd403c7d", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "description": "A District technology company creates teachable moments by filming practice and real-life medicine."}, "article_summary": "Around Washington, George Washington University, Georgetown and Johns Hopkins Medical Schools are B-Line Medical customers.\nMedical mistakes: B-Line Medical is about catching them before they happen.\nB-Line\u2019s breakthrough came when its technology was purchased by Washington University in St. Louis and by Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.\nB-Line Medical also sells a platform called \u201cLiveCapture.\u201d That involves filming doctors and nurses caring for patients.\nHospitals using B-Line Medical can document events including operating-room activities, emergencies and routine hospital-room visits."}
