Students are then tested on those standards, she said.\n\nMcQueen clarified those statements during a tour of Randolph Howell Elementary in Columbia. The Tennessee Board of Education and state educators help develop the curriculum before it is adopted, she said.\n\n\u201cThe department (of education) helps with the training on those standards, and the assessment of those standards, and then the locals, whether that\u2019s the principal level or the teacher level, are making decisions around the curriculum that\u2019s used, instructional practices and strategies that are used,\u201d McQueen said. \u201cCertainly, we are setting that expectation, but how\u2019s it done, what instructional practices are used, what strategies are used, what curriculum is used is absolutely a local decision.\u201d\n\nBecause of the recent uproar over the Five Pillars of Islam being taught in schools, state social studies standards will be reviewed in January 2016, instead of 2018 as originally slated.\n\nEducators and state officials will examine whether the instruction is appropriately balanced and review teaching standards, McQueen said. She anticipated the process will last through the spring.\n\n\u201cOur intent has been to use the standards to actually look at world religions and world cultures and see how it impacts world history,\u201d McQueen said. \u201cThe way a parent can then talk about that at home is certainly an approach that will be individualized. They should take that information and have those conversations with students through their own belief system and weigh that appropriately inside their own homes.\u201d\n\nHanvey was unable to talk by phone Friday but answered The Daily Herald\u2019s questions by email. She echoed McQueen\u2019s statements that the state sets the standards, and the local districts develop the curriculum based on those standards.\n\nThe district sets the curriculum through pacing guides and can tailor the instruction through teaching strategies and activities in the classrooms, Hanvey said in the email.\n\n\u201cWe cannot remove the historical content regarding Islam or any other religion,\u201d she said. \u201cAs we discussed (Thursday) during the school board meeting, removing religious references would handicap the instruction of history. Religion has had a tremendous impact on the world\u2019s people.\u201d\n\nThe district would support changing the pacing guides, as long as it meets the standards by which students and teachers are measured, she wrote. Maury County schools review curriculum throughout the year and make revisions as needs are identified, Hanvey added.\n\nParents should engage school officials when they have concerns about what is being taught in schools, as they did during last week\u2019s meeting, she wrote.\n\n\u201cAt our individual schools, as always, we welcome parents\u2019 questions and want them to bring classroom concerns to their child\u2019s teacher and their child\u2019s principals,\u201d Hanvey said in the email.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Local schools have the freedom to tailor teachings as long as they align with state standards, but altering the curriculum to remove religious studies would put students at a disadvantage during test time, education officials said.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "TIM HODGE thodge@c-dh.net", "og": {"site_name": "Columbia Daily Herald", "description": "Local schools have the freedom to tailor teachings as long as they align with state standards, but altering the curriculum to remove religious studies would put students at a disadvantage during test time, education officials said.", "title": "Education commissioner talks Islam in schools issue", "url": "http://columbiadailyherald.com/news/local-news/education-commissioner-talks-islam-schools-issue", "image": "http://columbiadailyherald.com/sites/columbiadailyherald.com/files/field/media/web1_TN-Com-of-Ed-Candice-McQueen-at-Howell_2332_swt_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://columbiadailyherald.com/news/local-news/education-commissioner-talks-islam-schools-issue", "title": "Education commissioner talks Islam in schools issue", "card": "summary", "creator": "@thedailyherald"}, "al": {"web": {"should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"url": "columbiadailyherald://?eid=1312647", "app_name": "columbiadailyherald", "package": "com.stephensmedia.columbiadailyherald"}, "ios": {"url": "columbiadailyherald://?eid=1312647", "app_store_id": 964773799, "app_name": "columbiadailyherald"}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=964773799", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.stephensmedia.columbiadailyherald", "keywords": "Local News,,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-12T23:54:37-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9"}, "article_summary": "Dr. Jan Hanvey, Maury County Public Schools middle school supervisor, said during a Thursday school board meeting the district is following state curriculum guidelines.\nEducators and state officials will examine whether the instruction is appropriately balanced and review teaching standards, McQueen said.\nMaury County schools review curriculum throughout the year and make revisions as needs are identified, Hanvey added.\nThe Tennessee Board of Education and state educators help develop the curriculum before it is adopted, she said.\nShe echoed McQueen\u2019s statements that the state sets the standards, and the local districts develop the curriculum based on those standards."}
