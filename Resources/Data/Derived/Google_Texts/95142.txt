Sixteen percent who have considered quitting say they would work in a field they prefer where jobs typically provide little or no health insurance.

Speculation about "job-locked" employees who stay on the job only for insurance benefits has been mostly anecdotal â€” until now.

Four in 10 employees would leave their jobs if they could purchase health insurance on the open market that is comparable to their existing coverage and out-of-pocket expenses, according to a survey by the Securian Financial Group. The company spoke with 767 employed Americans in April. Ninety-four percent of respondents worked full time, and the others worked part time.
