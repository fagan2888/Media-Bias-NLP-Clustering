Some 30,000 state workers have already migrated to the new system \u2014 including Gov. Martin O'Malley and his top aides.\n\nFor the O'Malley administration, the transition has gone far more smoothly than the state's other ongoing major technology effort, the health insurance exchange developed to implement the Affordable Care Act. That more significant project has led to finger-pointing among contractors, hearings in Annapolis and political infighting.\n\nJeff Pittman, a spokesman for the Maryland chapter of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, said he wasn't aware of any workforce complaints about the state switching to Google.\n\nGovernment agencies have been steadily moving to the cloud for years, and several experts said that the progression is all but guaranteed to continue. For one thing, states save money by having to rely less on huge server farms that require significant electricity to keep them air-conditioned.\n\nUrban said he could not estimate how much money Maryland will save because the state's prior crazy quilt of email systems was so confusing that nobody knew how much was being spent on it.\n\nBut there are more mundane benefits to an integrated system, such as being able to reliably find contact information for an employee in another agency. In the past, workers had to search the other agency's website to find that information.\n\nGoogle, with more than $50 billion in annual revenue, has built an Internet empire that provides email, document storage, mapping, blogging software, phone and other services. The company announced earlier this year that it is expanding its effort in cloud computing, taking on companies such as Amazon and Microsoft.\n\nIn a statement, the company said it welcomed Maryland as the latest state \"empowering [its] employees to move fast and innovate with tools [it] can trust.\"\n\nThe rapid growth in cloud computing comes despite initial security concerns about whether data stored off-site is safe from attack or theft. Bhavani Thuraisingham, a computer science professor at the University of Texas at Dallas, said the systems can be designed to be safe.\n\nAnd Urban argued that the new system offers many improved safety features. Officials can now implement government-wide security protocols that block state employees from inadvertently emailing sensitive data, such as Social Security numbers, for instance. Some agencies have those measures in place now, but not all.\n\nFor O'Malley, who as mayor of Baltimore planted a BlackBerry on his hip long before smartphones became common, the transition to a smarter email system is a natural fit. The Democrat rose to national prominence in part by leveraging computer technology to create a program that kept the statistical pulse of the city known as CityStat.\n\nIn his City Hall days, there was often still a lot of paper on desks at CityStat meetings. Now, as he oversees the state equivalent of the program, the governor is apt to rely on a tablet.\n\nThe state of Colorado made the switch to Google in 2012 and rapidly moved about 30,000 employees onto the system.\n\nKristin Russell, Colorado's secretary of technology and chief information officer, said the transition was initially rough for some.\n\n\"It's just a different tool,\" she said. \"They're used to picking up a hammer to do something. I just gave them a screwdriver.\"\n\nBut Russell said that after the start up, the state never looked back. Now, employees are vastly expanding the number of documents they share. They no longer have to trade physical business cards to exchange contact information. Employees can now quickly reach one another.\n\n\"It isn't just email,\" Russell said. \"It's a very powerful tool.\"\n\njohn.fritze@baltsun.com\n\ntwitter.com/jfritze", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Email issues?
