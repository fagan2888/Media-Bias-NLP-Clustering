It will also include a new medical office building for doctors who want to set up shop on the property.\n\nThe second phase will increase the hospital's labor and delivery department and the nursery. It will also improve the neo-natal intensive care unit from a level two to a level three, allowing them to care for sicker babies and mothers.\n\nMowan said the expansion is needed to keep up with the demand.\n\n\"We're seeing a large, increasing demand over the last three or four years for health care services in Las Vegas,\" he said.\n\nMowan said now that more people have health insurance under the Affordable Care Act they are seeking health care through emergency rooms because it is difficult to get a primary care physician.\n\nMowan pointed out that Nevada ranks 48th in the nation for physician shortage. To help with that, the hospital is also starting a new residency program to train medical school graduates to become doctors specializing in internal medicine and family practice.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://knpr.org/knpr/2015-09/mountainview-hospital-begins-another-multi-million-dollar-expansion", "type": "article", "image": "http://knpr.org/sites/default/files/public/styles/detail/public/images/story/mnt-view-east.jpg?itok=pZ7J1xOH", "site_name": "Nevada Public Radio", "title": "MountainView Hospital Begins Another Multi-Million Dollar Expansion"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "HandheldFriendly": "True"}, "article_summary": "The expansion of MountainView Hospital comes two years after completion of another expansion project.\nMountainView Hospital says business is good.\n\"We're seeing a large, increasing demand over the last three or four years for health care services in Las Vegas,\" he said.\nChris Mowan, CEO of MountainView Hospital, told KNPR's State of Nevada that the first phase will add two more floors to the new south tower.\nBusiness is so good, the hospital is embarking on a $90 million expansion that will begin this month."}
