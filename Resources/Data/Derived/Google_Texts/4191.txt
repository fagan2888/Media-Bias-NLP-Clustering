The state of Oregon may be getting back in the health insurance game.

The Department of Consumer and Business Services, which oversees the Oregon Health Insurance Marketplace, is seeking proposals for technology solutions that could run the small business and individual marketplaces.

This means Oregon could again set up its own exchange platform, a strategy the state deviated from after Cover Oregon's failure to launch.

DCBS's Pat Allen told legislators Wednesday he would look at systems that are already running that could be implemented in Oregon, similar to Kentucky's Medicaid platform the state is now using to enroll and determine eligibility for Oregon Health Plan members.

The RFPs are due Feb. 5. Allen plans to provide an analysis of the options to the Legislature during the February session.

Oregon insurers face an additional fee proposed by the federal government for allowing the state to use HealthCare.gov for Obamacare enrollments.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has proposed a 3 percent of premium fee beginning in 2017. This would be in addition to the 2.9 percent fee the state already charges insurers to cover Marketplace expenses, Allen said. Currently, there's no fee for using HealthCare.gov.

The proposed fee would amount to $13 million, DCBS spokesman Jake Sunderland said.

It's possible the request for proposals could unearth a more affordable option, he said.
