The trees outside of Merrehope became a little more festive Sunday Afternoon.

Members of a 4-H Club, gathered outside of the historic home to decorate the trees for the holidays. 4-H President Keri Moore says the event has been done for many years in the past and they decided to continue it this year, as a service project in hopes of learning something from it.

"To make good leaders for the future of Meridian," Moore said.

The trees were decorated with edible decorations for the birds to feed on.
