Bellissimo!\n\nPlaudits came easily Sunday for the food, drink and fun at the 29th annual La Festa Italiana. This was the third and probably final year the festival was at the National Guard Center near 116th Street and Rainwood Road.\n\n\u201cNext year, if we\u2019re ready, we will be at our permanent home at 132nd and Fort,\u201d said Dr. Ted Bolamperti, one of the festival\u2019s founders. \u201cWe will have a 14,000-square-foot banquet facility on eight acres of grounds. It will be beautiful.\u201d\n\nLa Festa Italiana, sponsored by the American Italian Heritage Society, was first held at Peony Park. About 8,000 dinners are served every year over Labor Day weekend.\n\nBolamperti said every bit of the sausages, pizzas, pastries, meatballs and sauces are homemade. Even the garden vegetables and herbs are grown by some of the 1,000 volunteers.\n\n\u201cWe try to recreate a little bit of Italy here with our food and music,\u201d Bolamperti said. \u201cWe're pretty consistent. We've got it down to where we and our festival-goers like it.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, visitors toured a pictorial history of Italian-Americans in Omaha before heading into the dining hall.\n\nDon and Shirley Livingston of Omaha relaxed at a table after devouring salads, pizza, pasta with meatballs, and ice cream.\n\n\u201cThis is maybe only the second time we've come, but the food is very good,\u201d Don Livingston said. \u201cYou should've seen the size of the meatball she had.\u201d\n\nSausages sizzled on grills outdoors, and people purchased food and Italian wine and beer from booths.\n\nBeth Patterson sat under an umbrella with her daughter and two friends, listening to music. Patterson sipped a glass of Chianti wine as she talked about her appreciation for the spirit of the festival.\n\n\u201cI just love the tradition and the food and the camaraderie that you see passing from generation to generation,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt all starts with the hors d'oeuvres. The calamari and then the sausage and pizza and spaghetti and ice cream. You get here and turn into food mongers,\u201d Patterson said.\n\nOver the years, Bolamperti said, the American Italian Heritage Society has awarded nearly $100,000 in scholarships and donated more than $20,000 to homeless shelters.\n\nHis son Ted \u201cSecundo\u201d Bolamperti II, 48, recalled helping in the kitchen as a teenager. Now the kitchen is his domain.\n\nBolamperti guides every aspect of the food preparation \u2014 including showing a youngster how to properly shake Parmesan cheese on bread before it goes into the oven, or stirring gallons of thick red tomato sauce.\n\n\u201cWe start making the things we can freeze, like pastries, on the Fourth of July weekend,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery weekend we\u2019re making something to get ready.\u201d\n\nWhen La Festa\u2019s permanent home opens next year, other groups will be invited to use the grounds, Bolamperti said.\n\n\u201cEverybody should be proud of his heritage.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Omaha.com", "description": "This was the third and probably final year the festival was at the National Guard Center near 116th Street and Rainwood Road.", "title": "Homemade dishes mark 29th annual La Festa Italiana", "url": "http://www.omaha.com/news/homemade-dishes-mark-th-annual-la-festa-italiana/article_4a11d54d-51e7-50a7-98bd-5de49eca21e6.html", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/omaha.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/d/be/dbeb9d8e-8815-519b-955e-f4a144866b40/53330ad639151.image.jpg?resize=600%2C504", "height": 504}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@OWHnews", "card": "summary"}, "description": "This was the third and probably final year the festival was at the National Guard Center near 116th Street and Rainwood Road.", "fb": {"app_id": 117714391577072}, "keywords": "news", "google-site-verification": "gE-kSjgMAF16OyUU3QCB0Ap0PQnFlh5oPdueJO6D2cQ", "news_keywords": "news"}, "article_summary": "It will be beautiful.\u201dLa Festa Italiana, sponsored by the American Italian Heritage Society, was first held at Peony Park.\nPlaudits came easily Sunday for the food, drink and fun at the 29th annual La Festa Italiana.\n\u201cNext year, if we\u2019re ready, we will be at our permanent home at 132nd and Fort,\u201d said Dr. Ted Bolamperti, one of the festival\u2019s founders.\nOver the years, Bolamperti said, the American Italian Heritage Society has awarded nearly $100,000 in scholarships and donated more than $20,000 to homeless shelters.\n\u201cYou should've seen the size of the meatball she had.\u201dSausages sizzled on grills outdoors, and people purchased food and Italian wine and beer from booths."}
