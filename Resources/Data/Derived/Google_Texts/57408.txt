BLANTYRE, Malawi (AP) — An aid official in Malawi says the prevention of waterborne diseases is a priority where floods have killed at least 176 people and displaced 200,000.

Oxfam’s country director in Malawi, John Makina, told The Associated Press Sunday from Lilongwe that the international aid organization is focused on preventing the spread of diseases like malaria, cholera and diarrhea.

Malawi’s southern districts, which have been the worst hit, remain difficult to access because of impassable roads, said Makina. In other areas the floods are receding and people who had taken refuge in tented camps are beginning to return home, he said.

Vice President Saulos Chilima said that heavy rains are expected to continue and urged Malawians in low-lying areas to move to higher ground and avoid crossing rivers.
