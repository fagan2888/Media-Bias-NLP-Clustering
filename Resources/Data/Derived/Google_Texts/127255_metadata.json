Scott Walker has vowed to clean up the Obama administration\u2019s mess, and he intends to do so without using any additional money from the state\u2019s general purpose revenue fund.\n\nThe Republican governor has called for legislation to extend BadgerCare coverage by three months for close to 80,000 Wisconsin residents while the federal government irons out the kinks that have massively disrupted the Affordable Care Act\u2019s online exchange systems.\n\nApproximately 77,000 Wisconsinites were expected to switch from BadgerCare Plus \u2014 the state\u2019s version of Medicaid \u2014 to the new federal insurance plans on Jan. 1, but Walker said the problems that have plagued the exchanges likely will prevent that from happening.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want anyone in this state to fall through the cracks,\u201d Walker said Thursday.\n\nOnly 877 Wisconsin residents had selected a marketplace insurance plan through the federal online exchange system between Oct. 1 and Nov. 2, according to a report released Wednesday by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nWalker said that failure is precisely why he rejected more than $4 billion in federal funding through 2019 to expand Medicaid coverage in Wisconsin as part of the ACA.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve said time and time again, I\u2019m not going to jeopardize and put at risk the taxpayers in my state for a federal government that cannot balance its budget, a federal government that continues to grow the national debt, as well as the deficit, and today \u2026 a federal government that can\u2019t even get a basic website up and going they\u2019ve known about for several years,\u201d Walker said.\n\nUnder Walker\u2019s proposal, 77,000 citizens would be able to keep their BadgerCare coverage until March 31. After that date, they would be responsible for getting insurance through the federal exchange.\n\nThe BadgerCare extension will not require any additional general purpose revenue funds, according to Walker.\n\nThe governor\u2019s 2013-2015 budget already had added approximately $650 million in general purpose revenue for Medicaid. Overall, the total Medicaid budget for the 2013-2015 biennium is about $16.3 billion.\n\nWalker is also asking the Wisconsin Legislature to pass a bill that would extend the state\u2019s Health Insurance Risk-Sharing Plan by three months to provide an added safety net during the transition.\n\nThe Health Insurance Risk-Sharing Plan, which covers about 20,000 people, has a considerable surplus to allow the state to continue the program, Walker said.\n\nAttempts to reach the Wisconsin Office of the Commissioner of Insurance to determine the amount of the surplus were unsuccessful.\n\nBoth of Walker\u2019s initiatives, which are expected to be considered by the Legislature in a special session sometime after Thanksgiving, would not require approval from the federal government, according to Tom Evenson, the governor\u2019s spokesman.\n\nWalker predicts the legislation will pass with broad bipartisan support.\n\nBut some Democratic lawmakers are not as optimistic.\n\n\u201cWhat Governor Walker failed to mention during his press conference (Thursday) is that we wouldn\u2019t need to call for a special session if he had not repeatedly refused funding to strengthen BadgerCare and develop a Wisconsin-specific health care exchange,\u201d state Rep. Sandy Pasch, D-Shorewood, said in a press release.\n\nWalker is also requesting that the federal government grant the state a waiver that would allow Wisconsinites who qualify for subsidies to be able to use that financial assistance for any qualified health plan, even those outside the exchanges.\n\nWalker\u2019s proposal comes on the heels of President Barack Obama\u2019s announcement that Americans will now be able to keep their cancelled health insurance policies for a year.\n\nMore than 4.8 million Americans had received notices that their preexisting plans were soon to be illegal, according to Forbes.\n\nInsurance companies must also inform consumers of what benefits those plans lack, and of options for better coverage under the new law.\n\nObama\u2019s initiative is extremely similar to the \u201cIf You Like Your Health Care, You Can Keep It Act,\u201d that was already introduced by U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis.\n\nContact Adam Tobias at atobias@watchdog.org or follow him on Twitter @Scoop_Tobias", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Wisconsin governor unveils plan to address Obamacare rollout failure", "title": "Wisconsin governor proposes insurance plan to address Obamacare rollout failure - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2012/07/ScottWalker-2-300x238.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-11-14T17:23:57+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/116284/wisconsin-obamacare-governor/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "News", "tag": "Affordable Care Act,BadgerCare,Barack Obama,Health Insurance Risk-Sharing Plan,medicaid,ObamaCare,Ron Johnson,Scott Walker,Tom Evenson,U.S. Department of Health and Human Services,Wisconsin", "published_time": "2013-11-14T15:52:54+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-14T17:23:57+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Wisconsin governor unveils plan to address Obamacare rollout failure", "creator": "@watchdogorg", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/10/scottwalker.jpg"}, "title": "Wisconsin governor proposes insurance plan to address Obamacare rollout failure - Watchdog.org", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "description": "Wisconsin governor unveils plan to address Obamacare rollout failure"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddfd2\"", "article_summary": "Under Walker\u2019s proposal, 77,000 citizens would be able to keep their BadgerCare coverage until March 31.\nWalker\u2019s proposal comes on the heels of President Barack Obama\u2019s announcement that Americans will now be able to keep their cancelled health insurance policies for a year.\nThe Health Insurance Risk-Sharing Plan, which covers about 20,000 people, has a considerable surplus to allow the state to continue the program, Walker said.\nAttempts to reach the Wisconsin Office of the Commissioner of Insurance to determine the amount of the surplus were unsuccessful.\nWalker said that failure is precisely why he rejected more than $4 billion in federal funding through 2019 to expand Medicaid coverage in Wisconsin as part of the ACA."}
