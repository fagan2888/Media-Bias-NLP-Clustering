Barack Obama had assured us \u2013 another in his long series of broken promises \u2013 that the meetings held to devise the plan would be televised on C-SPAN. Americans would have every opportunity to know what the law is, and how it would affect them.\n\nThat never happened. The law was put together behind closed doors. Nancy Pelosi later arrogantly told us \u201cwe have to pass the law so you can know what\u2019s in it.\u201d\n\nNow we\u2019re finding out.\n\nNational Right to Life was a lone early voice exposing how the law would cause rationing of life-saving care. But Obamacare supporters have mocked the claim. Their standard line has been \u201cthe ACA is designed to expand coverage, not reduce it.\u201d\n\nBut that\u2019s only one part of the law. Central to this overhaul of our healthcare system is a harsh regime of rationing \u2013 denial of care. And it\u2019s finally being admitted.\n\n_______________\n\nAmericans don\u2019t yet realize the law will prevent you from\n\nspending your own money to get treatments deemed \u201cineffective\u201d in an Orwellian way\n\nby the unelected, largely unaccountable IPAB board.\n\n_______________\n\nLast summer, former Vermont governor, Democratic presidential candidate, physician and Obamacare supporter Howard Dean made headlines when he spilled the beans. The Independent Payment Advisory Board set up by Obamacare, Dean said, was \u201cessentially a health care rationing board.\u201d\n\nFurther clarification about the role of this board, known as IPAB, came in a series of interviews and tweets last week by Time magazine Senior Political Analyst Mark Halperin. Coming from an avowed supporter of universal coverage, as Halperin is, the interviews were very instructive, containing insights every American should know.\n\nHalperin first discussed rationing on a November 25th Newsmax TV program. \u201cIt\u2019s built into the plan. It\u2019s not like a guess or like a judgment. That\u2019s going to be part of how costs are controlled.\u201d\n\nLater that day, Halperin clarified in a tweet that his comments were not about so-called \u201cdeath panels,\u201d as the show\u2019s host had termed it, but about rationing. This is an important distinction for pro-lifers to understand so we (unlike Obama) are completely clear and honest about what the Affordable Care Act does when we discuss it with others.\n\n\u201cDeath Panels\u201d vs. broad government-generated rationing in the ACA\n\nThe British National Health Service (NHS) has appeals committees to review \u201cindividual funding requests.\u201d They meet to determine whether treatments in a specific case will or won\u2019t be paid for by the government health care system, NHS. These have sometimes been termed \u201cdeath panels\u201d because if a patient needs a treatment to save or extend his life and can\u2019t afford to pay for it himself, a verdict of \u201cno\u201d by the committee means the patient could die \u2013 hence, the term \u201cdeath panel.\u201d\n\nObamcare\u2019s Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB) will not operate this way. It won\u2019t review individual cases; in fact, the law is written to preclude this type of direct rationing. That\u2019s why some Obamacare supporters protest that the law actually bars IPAB from rationing.\n\nBut Obamacare actually gives IPAB far more power to ration than if it was acting as judge and jury to individual patients. Broadly speaking, IPAB is given sweeping powers to recommend to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) whether and how whole categories of treatments are to be reimbursed \u2013 and is required to use these powers to prevent overall health care spending from being allowed even to keep up with medical inflation. Thus, they can (in fact, it is their job to) limit reimbursement and ration care from thousands or millions of people at a time.\n\nFor example, IPAB might decide that a new, promising treatment for breast cancer is not \u201ccost-effective,\u201d given the board\u2019s calculation of the number of lives it might save versus the cost to offer the treatment. HHS might then issue a \u201cquality measure\u201d binding on health care providers that does not authorize use of the treatment.\n\nEffectively, HHS would have the power to drive most doctors out of business if they ignore its directives to ration. Women who might have been saved by the new treatment would die if the older, cheaper treatments don\u2019t cure them.\n\nHalperin was open about the law\u2019s intention to ration in a follow-up interview on CNBC last Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThose decisions that are made by that board are going to lead to what I think could be described perfectly reasonably as rationing, \u201c Halperin said. \u201cAgain, as I said, that\u2019s built into the system.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Independent Payment Advisory Board, which is a big part of the Affordable Care Act that is central to cost control, is something that hasn\u2019t been debated in a real way . . . we need to have that debate in this country.\u201d\n\nCLICK LIKE IF YOU\u2019RE PRO-LIFE!\n\nCurrently, if an insurance company, doctor or hospital denies you a treatment or payment for a treatment, you have several options. States have insurance commissions to which you have a right to appeal payment denials by insurance companies. You can go to another doctor or hospital to get care.\n\nUnder Obamacare, these avenues will be largely closed off to you and your loved ones. If the government says you can\u2019t get a treatment, your current ability to appeal to a government body will be curtailed. And Americans don\u2019t yet realize the law will prevent you from spending your own money to get treatments deemed in an Orwellian way \u201cineffective\u201d by the unelected, largely unaccountable IPAB board.\n\nThat makes it absolutely critical that National Right to Life inform Americans, warn Americans, empower Americans to overturn this law that will be so deadly to so many of their loved ones \u2013 and ultimately to many of us.
