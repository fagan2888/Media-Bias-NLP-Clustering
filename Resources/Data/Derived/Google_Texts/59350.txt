Former U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Human Services Secretary, Democrat Kathleen Sebelius, believes “politics is denying health care and coverage” for about 150,000 low-income Kansans who would be covered by the expansion of Medicaid as part of the federal Affordable Care Act. Sebelius oversaw the rollout of “Obamacare” starting in 2010. She served in President Barack Obama’s cabinet from April 2009 through June 2014.

Republican governors of several states, including Kansas, have refused to participate in the Medicaid expansion program.

Sebelius, who also served as Kansas governor from 2003 to 2009 and Kansas Insurance Commissioner prior to that, spoke at Fort Hays State University Monday night. She kicked off this season’s Keith G. Sebelius Lecture Series, named after her father-in-law, former U.S. Rep. Keith Sebelius, R-Norton, who graduated from FHSU in 1941.

Her one-hour discussion with moderator Dr. Chapman Rackaway, acting chairman of the FHSU Political Science Department and Director of Liberal Education, drew laughter, numerous rounds of applause and a final standing ovation from the audience in Beach/Schmidt Performing Arts Center.

Sebelius met briefly with the local media prior to her public appearance.

She was asked about the ACA, the legacy and public service of Keith Sebelius, the law that will allow most people to carry concealed firearms without a permit on the campuses of Kansas universities, and her transition from longtime public servant to working as an adviser in the private sector.

Gary Sebelius, son of Keith and husband of Kathleen, was in the audience. He is a federal magistrate judge.
