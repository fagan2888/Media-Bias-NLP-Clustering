That elected official would be Robert Battle, who ran unopposed and was sworn in for his second term on the council in county jail (via Chicago Tribune):\n\nAn unnamed official was brought in to do the swearing-in on Friday for Battle, who is being held in federal custody at the Porter County facility, according to Sheriff David Reynolds. \"There is no reason for me to deny it legally,\" Reynolds said, adding he spoke to the U.S. marshal, who agreed. Battle could have chosen to be sworn in via video conferencing but opted for an in-person oath, Reynolds said. Indiana law permits Battle to hold his seat \u2013 and collect the $42,365 salary that it pays \u2013 until he resigns, admits his guilt on any of the charges or is found guilty in court. Battle, a Democrat, ran unopposed in November and received 308 votes.\n\nAccording to the Washington Post, John Buncich, chair of the Lake County Democratic Central Committee, is upset over the current situation since no bond was offered during Battle\u2019s arraignment, meaning he cannot fulfill the duties of his elected office. He also mentioned that Battle didn\u2019t even vote for himself since he was in jail at the time. Additionally, the publication noted that the city is a hotbed for corruption and delved into Battle\u2019s murder and drug charges:", "article_metadata": {"description": "What!?.05/27/2016 8:21:24AM EST.", "author": "Matt Vespa", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "What!?", "title": "Surreal: East Chicago City Councilman Takes Oath In Jail Because He\u2019s Been Saddled With Murder and Drug Charges", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2016/01/26/surreal-east-chicago-city-councilman-takes-oath-in-jail-because-hes-been-saddled-with-murder-and-drug-charges-n2110020", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2016/1/26/1.png", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "What!?", "title": "Surreal: East Chicago City Councilman Takes Oath In Jail Because He\u2019s Been Saddled With Murder and Drug Charges", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2016/01/26/surreal-east-chicago-city-councilman-takes-oath-in-jail-because-hes-been-saddled-with-murder-and-drug-charges-n2110020", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2016/1/26/1.png", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Surreal: East Chicago City Councilman Takes Oath In Jail Because He\u2019s Been Saddled With Murder and Drug Charges , Matt Vespa, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "Additionally, the publication noted that the city is a hotbed for corruption and delved into Battle\u2019s murder and drug charges:\nJust over the Illinois border, East Chicago City, Indiana is the home of a rather bizarre incident: a city councilman has been re-elected, despite being hit with federal murder and drug charges.\nBattle, a Democrat, ran unopposed in November and received 308 votes.\nBattle could have chosen to be sworn in via video conferencing but opted for an in-person oath, Reynolds said.\nHe also mentioned that Battle didn\u2019t even vote for himself since he was in jail at the time."}
