Very recently, he and his wife, Amal Alamuddin, sat with Syrian refugees in Germany and the International Rescue Committee to talk about the partisan divide between rejecting and accepting them into Western nations.\n\nThe Inquisitr recently covered George Clooney\u2019s response to Donald Trump from the same letter, giving more details along with the ticket prices for the fundraiser and his views on Bernie Sanders.\n\nHis attack on Trump is just one of many since he\u2019s taken a liberal political stance, as when the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported in 2014 that there was an exchange between him and casino owner Steve Wynn, who was being critical about the Affordable Care Act during dinner at a promotional event for Clooney\u2019s tequila, Casamigos.\n\nWhen George Clooney was asked about the incident then, he said it was less about politics and more about character, and it\u2019s been reported that some expletives were exchanged.\n\nMuch like Donald Trump however, Steve Wynn fired back, and the article appears to make it seem as if he\u2019s continued to attack George Clooney for having too much to drink. Wynn has made statements saying that when only when he\u2019s drunk does Clooney say that the president is his \u201cfriend.\u201d He\u2019s made other comments such as, \u201cIf you drink with George Clooney, make sure you get there early and don\u2019t stay too late.\u201d\n\nIn that same year, prior to getting married to human rights lawyer Amal Alamuddin, The Daily Mail wrote that the marriage was probably part of his plan to become more involved with politics and hinted that he might run for office.\n\nBut The Independent reported that those were just rumors, as he said he was not interested and added that Obama is \u201csmarter than anybody,\u201d with no need for anyone like Clooney to take his place.\n\nThe United Nations made George Clooney a messenger of peace in 2008, as his central cause has been around the situation in Darfur, but The Independent also mentions that he stepped down from his role as a United Nations peace messenger because he was too busy.\n\nHis new \u201crival,\u201d Donald Trump, recently referred to the United Nations during his speech at AIPAC, where he said that if he were elected president, he would remove the United Nations from the negotiation process between Israel and the Palestinians, which is mentioned in an article about Hillary Clinton\u2019s views of the conflict by The Inquisitr.\n\nClearly, George Clooney\u2019s life is loaded with political responsibilities, with his wife Amal having been working vigorously on getting an overthrown president out of prison in the Maldives, an area which reportedly has a growing ISIS presence.\n\nAs the first guest on The Late Show With Stephen Colbert last year, George Clooney spoke on his activism and her work.\n\nWhile doing promotion for his new film Hail Caesar! at the Berlin Film Festival, George Clooney was asked by a reporter what else he did other than make movies and hang out with politicians.\n\nThis caused the award-winning actor to snap back at the reporter, asking him what he was doing to try to make the world a better place, according to Contact Music:\n\n\u201cI spend a lot of time working on these things, and it\u2019s an odd thing to have someone stand up and say, \u2018What do you do?\u2019 That\u2019s fine, knock yourself out,\u201d he bristled visibly when the Mexican journalist grilled him. \u201cI have gone to places that are very dangerous and I work a lot on these things. I\u2019d like to know what you are doing to help the situation?\u201d he finished his outburst.\n\nEven closer to George Clooney is that, as an actor, he\u2019s a member of the Screen Actor\u2019s Guild (SAG) and recently remembered the SAG-AFTRA president Ken Howard, who died Wednesday at the age of 71 according to People.\n\nSAG offers protection for actors who are considered union, which George Clooney no doubt supports.\n\nThe Wrap goes into more details about George Clooney\u2019s dinner event for Hillary Clinton, saying that other events will take place in San Francisco and name drops the presence of other heavy-hitters like Steven Spielberg.\n\n[Featured image by Pablo Martinez Monsivais | AP Photo]", "article_metadata": {"description": "American actor George Clooney recently announced his endorsement for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in a letter sent to her supporters", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "American actor George Clooney recently announced his endorsement for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in a letter sent to her supporters", "title": "A Short History Of George Clooney\u2019s Political Activism And The Times He\u2019s Lost His Cool", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/2920932/a-short-history-of-george-clooneys-political-activism-and-the-times-hes-lost-his-cool/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/AP_120315085098-900x440.jpg", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-24T05:17:50+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-24T05:41:16+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/AP_120315085098-900x440.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2016-03-24T05:17:50+00:00", "fb": {"pages": 71179904752, "app_id": 164157850314499}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "activism,george clooney,george clooney political view,hillary clinton,buzzworthy", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/AP_120315085098-900x440.jpg", "height": 440, "width": 900}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "American actor George Clooney recently announced his endorsement for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in a letter sent to her supporters"}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "article_summary": "American actor George Clooney recently announced his endorsement for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in a letter sent to her supporters.\nAs the first guest on The Late Show With Stephen Colbert last year, George Clooney spoke on his activism and her work.\nBut George Clooney has not shied away from his political views, as he\u2019s made them very public since 2005, around the time he released Syriana.\nSAG offers protection for actors who are considered union, which George Clooney no doubt supports.\nat the Berlin Film Festival, George Clooney was asked by a reporter what else he did other than make movies and hang out with politicians."}
