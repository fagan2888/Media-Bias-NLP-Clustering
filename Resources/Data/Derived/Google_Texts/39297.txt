CLAYTON, MO (KTVI) – Authorities are investigating whether a member of the grand jury in the Michael Brown shooting case may have leaked information.

Our partners at the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, report that a woman with the Twitter handle @thesusannichols tweeted, “...I know someone sitting on the grand jury of this case. There isn't enough at this point to warrant an arrest. #Ferguson."

That account has since been deleted.

St. Louis County Prosecutor Bob Mcculloch told the paper that he would “be shocked if a jury member said anything”.
