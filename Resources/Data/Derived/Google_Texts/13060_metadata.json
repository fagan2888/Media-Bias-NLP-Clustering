In a trend that speeded up in the 1980s and \u201990s, however, the low end of the economy has broadened outward like a pyramid with a disproportionately wide base.\n\n\u201cThis is not an overall improvement in job quality,\u201d Autor said. \u201cThe problem with many of these jobs is they require fairly generic skill sets, which means workers have limited negotiating power and are fairly interchangeable. These are not, in general, attractive jobs.\u201d\n\nThe statistical snapshots of the most in-demand jobs, however, aren\u2019t well known. Surprisingly few experts study the perennially practical question of where actual jobs can be found, particularly compared with the armies of analysts who react furiously to every backward-looking unemployment index.\n\nThe Labor Department\u2019s rankings of job openings don\u2019t attract much attention because the agency doesn\u2019t include them in its Bureau of Labor Statistics database, where postings often trigger wild swings in world stock markets. Instead, the Labor Department hosts in-demand jobs on a website called CareerOneStop.\n\nWhat\u2019s remarkable about the rankings is how deeply the low-wage sector \u2014 once seen as temporary and transitional \u2014 has entrenched itself in the world of work.\n\nAccording to the Labor Department, the No. 1 employment opportunity in the U.S. is for retail salespeople.\n\nTypical retail work requires \u201cless than high school\u201d education.\n\nRetail jobs do not always pay well, but there are plenty of them: Nearly 200,000 open up on average each year in the U.S.\n\nAt the Labor Department, officials have developed complex models to predict annual demand for occupations. The figures on CareerOneStop are updated every two years, meaning the estimates do not reflect an exact real-time tally of openings. To create its rankings, the Labor Department culls data from each state as well as the Bureau of Labor Statistics. High turnover, which leads to more openings, is among the factors in the rankings, said Jason Kuruvilla, a spokesman for the Labor Department.\n\nThe estimates include hourly and annual wage levels for each occupation in each state \u2014 an average cashier grosses $18,700 a year in Texas but $20,600 in California, for example.\n\nCareerOneStop also breaks out occupations according to levels of education. Pay rises quickly for those with a two-year or four-year degree \u2014 although the estimated volume of openings for higher-paying occupations dwindles rapidly in comparison to low-end sectors.\n\nThe site also ranks the fastest-growing occupations. Those show high growth, but often off a low base. The nation\u2019s leading high-growth occupation is called \u201cindustrial-organizational psychologist,\u201d which requires a master\u2019s degree and pays $80,300 a year. Those openings are projected to grow over 50 percent by 2022, albeit with only 1,600 openings per year nationally.\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum are what the Labor Department calls occupations with declining employment.\n\nMany of the fast-disappearing jobs pay well, but the list evokes an earlier age: data-entry workers, meter readers, travel agents, typists, loggers, locomotive firers, motion picture projectionists, and multiple categories of postal workers.\n\nJohn Schmid,\n\nMilwaukee Journal Sentinel", "article_metadata": {"description": "The current slate of job openings overwhelmingly involves cashiers, waitstaff, personal aides, janitors, and fast food workers.", "og": {"description": "The current slate of job openings overwhelmingly involves cashiers, waitstaff, personal aides, janitors, and fast food workers.", "title": "Most U.S. job openings are for low-skill, low-pay workers", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20150425-most-u.s.-job-openings-are-for-low-skill-low-pay-workers.ece", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20150425-biz_wrk-jobmarket_mw_43336379.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/BIZ_WRK-JOBMARKET_MW_43336379.JPG", "height": 853}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2015-04-25T23:17:21Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2015-04-25T23:17:21Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Most U.S. job openings are for low-skill, low-pay workers\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20150425-most-u.s.-job-openings-are-for-low-skill-low-pay-workers.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20150425-biz_wrk-jobmarket_mw_43336379.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/BIZ_WRK-JOBMARKET_MW_43336379.JPG\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"2271637\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-04-25T23:17:21Z\", \"section\": \"Economy & You Headlines\", \"author\": \"\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20150425-biz_wrk-jobmarket_mw_43336379.jpg.ece/ALTERNATES/w660/BIZ_WRK-JOBMARKET_MW_43336379.JPG", "publishtime": "2015-04-25T23:17:21Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "article_summary": "It turns out the vast preponderance of job openings these days are low-skill, hourly-wage work with high turnover.\nTo create its rankings, the Labor Department culls data from each state as well as the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nAt the other end of the spectrum are what the Labor Department calls occupations with declining employment.\nThose openings are projected to grow over 50 percent by 2022, albeit with only 1,600 openings per year nationally.\nMany of the fast-disappearing jobs pay well, but the list evokes an earlier age: data-entry workers, meter readers, travel agents, typists, loggers, locomotive firers, motion picture projectionists, and multiple categories of postal workers."}
