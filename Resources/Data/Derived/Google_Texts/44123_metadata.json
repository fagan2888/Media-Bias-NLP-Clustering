Wade, Sen. Lindsey Graham today introduced a measure in the U.S. Senate that would drastically limit women\u2019s ability to access abortions past a certain point in their pregnancy.\n\nThe legislation, called the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, passed the House in May by a 242-to-184 vote and would ban abortions after 20 weeks (approximately halfway through a pregnancy).\n\nThe bill is based on a broad consensus of research that shows unborn infants are able to feel pain 20 weeks after fertilization, and at this point, children\u2019s hospitals throughout the U.S. \u201croutinely\u201d administer fetal anesthesia when performing surgery.\n\nThe measure includes exceptions for cases of rape, incest or to save the life of the mother.\n\n\u201cThe legislation is groundbreaking, but simple at the same time,\u201d Graham, a Republican from South Carolina, told a group of reporters today. \u201cDoes the government have a legitimate compelling interest to protect that baby? The answer, I believe, is yes.\u201d\n\nSpeaking in front of prominent pro-life leaders in Washington, D.C., Graham promised a vote on the measure this year, noting that America is only one of seven nations\u2014in the company of China and North Korea\u2014to allow late-term abortions.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re part of a pretty exclusive club that I would like to get out of,\u201d he said.\n\nA Senate source told The Daily Signal that Republicans hope to vote on the legislation around the time that Pope Francis is scheduled to address a joint session of Congress on Sept. 24.\n\nIn order to become law, Graham will have to win the support of 60 senators and President Obama, who has already threatened a veto.\n\n\u201c[The legislation] disregards women\u2019s health and rights, the role doctors play in their patients\u2019 health care decisions, and the Constitution,\u201d Obama said in an earlier statement to the press.\n\nTony Perkins, president of the pro-life Family Research Council, called on Obama during Graham\u2019s press conference to \u201cbring his policies in line with his rhetoric.\u201d\n\nPerkins cited a speech Obama made to the Catholic Health Association on Tuesday, in which he said:\n\n\u201c[E]very human being, made in the image of God, deserves to live in dignity; that all children, no matter who they are or where they come from or how much money they were born into, ought to have the opportunity to achieve their God-given potential.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe agree with President Obama,\u201d Perkins said. \u201cThat potential, that opportunity, it begins with life.\u201d\n\nAccording to public opinion polls, the majority of Americans support limits on late-term abortions.\n\nFor that reason, Graham and leaders of the pro-life community hope to rally bipartisan support for the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act.\n\n\u201cIs there a point where we can find common ground and come together on this?\u201d asked Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the national pro-life group Susan B. Anthony List.\n\n\u201cThis is the most important piece of legislation in 40 years since Roe v Wade,\u201d she said.\n\nLate-term abortions performed after 20 weeks, when not done by induction of labor (which leads to fetal death due to prematurity), are most commonly performed by dilation and evacuation procedures, which often involve removing the fetus with forceps or other instruments.\n\nIn 2013, a congressional report found that some 11,000 abortions take place each year at 20 weeks or more after fertilization.\n\nDespite there being no national law banning the procedure, a number of states have taken it upon themselves to limit women\u2019s access to late-term abortions.\n\n>>> Read More: Where Does Your State Stand on Late-Term Abortions?\n\nCritics of the bill\u2014including some physicians\u2014argue the unborn child is \u201cincapable of experiencing pain until a point later in pregnancy than 20 weeks after fertilization,\u201d and doubt the measure would stand up to a Supreme Court challenge.\n\nThe 1973 Supreme Court case Roe v. Wade left room for states to impose limitations on abortions, so long as there\u2019s a compelling state interest, and those restrictions do not enact an \u201cundue burden\u201d on the right to access an abortion.\n\nOn Tuesday, a federal appeals court upheld a strict abortion law in Texas that critics call \u201cdevastating,\u201d and say would shut down the majority of clinics in the state.\n\n>>> Read More: \u2018Devastating\u2019 Texas Abortion Law Could Be on Road to US Supreme Court\n\nIn the case, the court ruled that the the law does not impose an \u201cundue burden,\u201d on women\u2019s ability to access abortions.\n\n\u201cTexas\u2019 stated purpose for enacting H.B. 2 was to provide the highest quality of care to women seeking abortions and to protect the health and welfare of women seeking abortions,\u201d read the ruling by the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans. \u201cThere is no question that this is a legitimate purpose that supports regulating physicians and the facilities in which they perform abortions.\u201d\n\nWhen asked whether the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act would stand up in a similar fashion, Graham said:\n\n\u201cI think science is on our side and I think law will be on our side.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sen.
