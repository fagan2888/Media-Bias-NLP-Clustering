You\u2019d think he\u2019d prefer to play against immobile, pocket passers like his own Peyton Manning or Tom Brady. But as it turns out, Ware likes playing against the scramblers.\n\nWhy? Because Ware loves the chase. And he has the speed for it. He showed his pass-rush speed Thursday night as three times he ran after Seattle quarterback Russell Wilson. Ware caught Wilson once for a 1-yard sack and hurried him the other two times.\n\n\u201cThink about it, I\u2019ve been playing a long time against quarterbacks who can run,\u201d said Ware, a former Dallas Cowboy who played in the NFC East Division. \u201cOne of them being Michael Vick. Then you\u2019ve got RG III. That\u2019s four games out of the season where you\u2019re going to be chasing somebody. The majority of the quarterbacks in the NFC, they can run. You get used it. You figure out how to cage-rush them. I like it.\u201d\n\nWilson has some nifty, back-tracking, escape moves. When he started to scramble away from pressure in the Super Bowl, the Broncos didn\u2019t have anybody who can chase him down. Ware was able to close.\n\n\u201cYou have to have a relentless rush against guys that can run,\u201d said Ware, whose 117.0 career sacks already ranks 18th all-time. \u201cBecause if you stop the rush they\u2019ll run somewhere else just to string plays out.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "DeMarcus Ware,Michael Vick,Peyton Manning,Russell Wilson,Tom Brady", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "First-and-Orange", "description": "DeMarcus Ware showed that he has the speed to go up against even quarterbacks like Russell Wilson, who can scramble with the football.", "title": "DeMarcus Ware: Preseason Defensive Player of the Game vs. Seattle", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2014/08/08/preseason-defensive-player-game-demarcus-ware/28638/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2014/08/demarcus-ware-vs-seahawks.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "DeMarcus Ware showed that he has the speed to go up against even quarterbacks like Russell Wilson, who can scramble with the football.", "creator": "@mikeklis", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2014/08/08/preseason-defensive-player-game-demarcus-ware/28638/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2014/08/demarcus-ware-vs-seahawks.jpg", "title": "Preseason Defensive Player of the Game vs. Seattle: DeMarcus Ware", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "DeMarcus Ware showed that he has the speed to go up against even quarterbacks like Russell Wilson, who can scramble with the football."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf3c9\"", "article_summary": "\u201cYou have to have a relentless rush against guys that can run,\u201d said Ware, whose 117.0 career sacks already ranks 18th all-time.\nHe showed his pass-rush speed Thursday night as three times he ran after Seattle quarterback Russell Wilson.\n\u201cBecause if you stop the rush they\u2019ll run somewhere else just to string plays out.\u201d\nWare caught Wilson once for a 1-yard sack and hurried him the other two times.\nBut as it turns out, Ware likes playing against the scramblers."}
