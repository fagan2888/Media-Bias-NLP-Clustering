Super Typhoon Haiyan, the most powerful storm of 2013, struck the central Philippines early Friday, killing at least four people. More than 700,000 people evacuated their homes.

5. Senate approves bill to ban workplace discrimination against gays

The Senate on Thursday passed a bill discriminating against workers over their sexual preference or gender identity. Ten Republicans joined the Senate's Democrats in a 64-32 vote that signaled how sharply views on gay rights have shifted in recent years.

6. Evangelist Billy Graham speaks out on his 95th birthday

Billy Graham delivered what was billed as his final sermon Thursday night at a party to celebrate his 95th birthday. The evangelist addressed hundreds of well-wishers in an Asheville, N.C., ballroom through a video that was recorded over the past year, in which he said the country is following the wrong path.

7. October jobs numbers are expected to show effects of shutdown

Economists expect the October employment report, which will be released Friday morning, to show that the unemployment rate rose from 7.2 percent to 7.3 percent, the first increase since May. Forecasters say employers probably added 122,000 jobs during the month, down from 148,000 in September and far below the average of 180,000 in the first nine months of the year. Many economists blame the anticipated decline on the two-week government shutdown, and expect a reversal in November. (UPDATE: 8:36 a.m.: The report shows the economy added 204,000 jobs in October, far more than expected.) [Associated Press]

9. The FDA proposes ridding the food supply of trans fats

The Food and Drug Administration is proposing standards to effectively ban artificial trans fats from American diets. The FDA plan, unveiled Thursday, would prevent companies from using partially hydrogenated oils, the source of trans fats, in food products, such as microwave popcorn and frozen pizzas, unless they can prove it poses no health threat. The move could prevent 20,000 heart attacks and 7,000 deaths a year, the FDA said. [New York Times]

10. The Sochi Olympic torch makes history in space

Crew members on the International Space Station are preparing to take the torch for the 2014 Winter Olympics on a space walk Saturday. The torch has been in space before — aboard the space shuttle Atlantis in 1996 — but this is its first trip outside an orbiting spacecraft. The torch won't be lit during its four days at the space station — that would be dangerous — but it will be part of the longest (39,000 miles) torch relay in history. [Irish Independent]
