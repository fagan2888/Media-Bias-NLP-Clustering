Polls don\u2019t matter. Bernie Sanders isn\u2019t going to beat Hillary in a primary. Yeah, I get it.\n\nBut Holy Workers Party Revolution, guys. The Republican brand is so bad right now that Bernie Democratic Socialist Sanders is beating every single major Republican candidate in a CNN poll released yesterday.\n\nAmong the adult population, Sanders beat Jeb Bush 48-47, Scott Walker 48-42 and Donald Trump by a massive 58-38 margin. When narrowing the field to registered voters, Sanders trails Bush by one point, but maintains solid leads among all other Republican challengers.\n\nTo be clear, 41 percent of respondents had never heard of Sanders, so his leads over the Republican candidates could be in many respects a function of voters selecting a generic Democrat ahead of any Republican. But at the end of the day, isn\u2019t that significant in and of itself? To the extent that voters are paying attention to the Republican primary campaign, they know that it\u2019s a hot mess, and that whichever candidate emerges from the fray is going to be someone who doesn\u2019t come close to sharing their values.\n\nSo sure, you can say that Sanders has little to no chance of beating Hillary Clinton in a primary campaign, but what you can\u2019t say is that you shouldn\u2019t vote for him because the general electorate would write him off as a beyond-the-pale extremist.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to note that the CNN poll\u2019s toplines recorded adults, while filtering for registered voters, and that likely voter models normally produce less favorable results for Democratic candidates. However, as Demos\u2019s Sean McElwee pointed out earlier today, the kinds of policies Sanders is advocating \u2014 debt-free college, universal pre-K, basic income, ending corporate welfare \u2014 are the kinds of policies that turn unlikely voters into voters. Sanders isn\u2019t electable simply because he isn\u2019t as extreme as his opponents make him out to be, and he isn\u2019t electable simply because the American public agrees with him on his core issues. The real reason Sanders is electable is that he has the potential to turn people out who otherwise wouldn\u2019t vote at all.\n\nAs McElwee noted, 54 percent of unregistered voters \u2014 over 25 million people who are disproportionately comprised of low-income, minority and liberal voters \u2014 believe that politics is too corrupt; 42 percent believe that there\u2019s no difference between the two parties. And when they say \u201cno difference,\u201d they may well acknowledge that one party wants to tweaks the marginal tax rate for the top one percent, or even that the two parties diverge significantly on social policy, but that isn\u2019t their point. When they say \u201cno difference\u201d they mean that politicians in both parties are beholden to a donor class that is fundamentally opposed to addressing the root causes of structural inequality; neither party really cares about people like them. Bernie Sanders is the only candidate who can make a credible claim to understanding this grievance, let alone wanting to do something about it, and for this reason he has a monopoly on the disaffected vote.\n\n(You could make the argument that Donald Trump is tapping into similar disaffection on the right. He is, but those voters are turning out to vote for the eventual Republican nominee either way.)\n\nThere\u2019s a reason why a poll last week found that Sanders is the only politician in either primary field with a net positive favorability rating: They like what he has to say, and they don\u2019t think he\u2019s sold out to the donor class.\n\nArmchair political observers have a tendency to measure electability in terms of endorsements and fundraising as opposed to, you know, the number of people who say they want to vote for a given candidate. But by that metric Bernie Sanders is in a position to do just fine in a general election.", "article_metadata": {"description": "They say Bernie Sanders isn't electable. Bernie Sanders is electable.
