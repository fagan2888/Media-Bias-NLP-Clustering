The individuals had attempted to report misconduct and wasted tax dollars to their superiors.\n\nOne whistleblower, Linda Thomas, filed a complaint alleging her boss was trying to move his entire staff to an office closer to his home in the Chicago suburbs. The supervisor responded by attempting to force her to work in a converted jail cell without a computer, desk or phone, she alleges. One day before she was scheduled to move to the cell, the Bureau of Prisons agreed to let her stay in her existing office. She was eventually transferred to what the Special Counsel calls \u201can appropriate work space\u201d at a different location.\n\nThe second whistleblower, Julia Landucci, a Minnesota-based employee, reported misconduct and management issues within her agency\u2019s substance-abuse program, including a gross misuse of taxpayer dollars. In this case, Landucci was removed from overseeing a drug abuse program and was referred for a mental health exam. Then her supervisor attempted to exile her to a tiny office \u2014 one that was roughly one-sixth of the size of her old office. What\u2019s worse, the Special Counsel maintained that Landucci\u2019s new office was conveniently situated right next to another employee against whom she had filed workplace violence and discrimination cases.\n\nRelated: Federal Waste, Fraud and Abuse: No One Pays the Price\n\nThe Office of Special Counsel ultimately stepped in before the bureau could move the workers into their newly assigned workstations. They were also able to switch office locations to resolve the issue.\n\nThe Justice Department declined to comment on the allegations. The Special Counsel\u2019s report says that the Bureau of Prisons leadership has cooperated with its investigations and has agreed to include whistleblower topics in its training sessions for new prison wardens.\n\nThe latest charges of whistleblower retaliation represent a new strike against the Justice Department, which federal auditors say is the worst agency for whistleblowers. Last month, the Government Accountability Office reported that the FBI doesn\u2019t have any real protections in place for employees who report wrongdoing.\n\nThe auditors said the Justice Department currently rejects nearly 90 percent of complaints by FBI employees who fear retaliation for coming forward with information about misconduct within their department. Between 2009 and 2013, 55 of the 62 complaints reviewed by the GAO were rejected.\n\nRelated: Riches or Retaliation Await Whistleblowers\n\nThat finding was the subject of a hearing before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary last month, where lawmakers grilled FBI officials for their treatment of whistleblowers.\n\n\u201cWhistleblowers are kind of treated like a skunk at a picnic, and I hope you\u2019ll do all you can to reverse that,\u201d Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA), chairman of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, told FBI Associate Deputy Director Kevin Perkins.\n\n\n\nThe allegations against Justice\u2019s treatment of whistleblowers come at a time when the government claims it is cracking down on retaliation. Lawmakers and agencies have proposed new whistleblower protections designed to encourage federal workers to come forward if they witness wrongdoing.\n\nThe government has for years offered financial incentives to whistleblowers, including millions of dollars to expose tax cheats at the IRS. Coming forward, however, can present a high risk of retaliation. For now, it seems the protections have not prevented retaliation from taking place.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Imagine you blow the whistle on a federal agency because it\u2019s guilty of misconduct \u2014 t", "title": "This Government Whistleblower Almost Wound Up in a Jail Cell", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/01/Government-Whistleblower-Almost-Wound-Jail-Cell", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/0611_whistleblower_630x420.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/01/Government-Whistleblower-Almost-Wound-Jail-Cell", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/0611_whistleblower_630x420.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Imagine you blow the whistle on a federal agency because it\u2019s guilty of misconduct \u2014 t", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "The Justice Department is being accused of unfairly punishing a whistleblower in exactly that way.\nThe individuals had attempted to report misconduct and wasted tax dollars to their superiors.\nThe latest charges of whistleblower retaliation represent a new strike against the Justice Department, which federal auditors say is the worst agency for whistleblowers.\nThe supervisor responded by attempting to force her to work in a converted jail cell without a computer, desk or phone, she alleges.\nImagine you blow the whistle on a federal agency because it\u2019s guilty of misconduct \u2014 then find yourself banished to a jail cell while you\u2019re still working there."}
