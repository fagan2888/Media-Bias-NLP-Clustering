If approved, it would be the largest K-12 capital construction bond issue in Boulder Valley's and Colorado's history. The district would raise the $576.5 million by selling bonds, with landowners paying back the debt over 30 years through property taxes. District officials project the total repayment cost of the bonds, once interest is added in, to be $1,351,017,635. It's estimated that the tax increase would cost homeowners an estimated $47 more a year per $100,000 of home value, or $188 a year for a $400,000 home.\n\nWhat supporters say: By addressing years of deferred maintenance through renovations and repairs, 3A will provide a significant positive impact. It's up to local communities to ensure that students, teachers and educational staff are provided with safe and effective learning environments. Fifty percent of the bond money will be used to address critical deferred maintenance on all 55 school buildings in the district, of which 72 percent are more than 30 years old. Funds will also be directed toward the rebuilding of three schools, building a new school in Erie and creating space to ensure there's enough space for all-day kindergarten and preschool programs for all children in Boulder Valley. An oversight committee will ensure that the money is spent as outlined in a facility master plan.\n\nWhat opponents say: The school district shouldn't have allowed schools to fall into disrepair and won't maintain improvements if the measure passes. Some of the projects are excessive or aren't true needs, such as a central district kitchen. The school district is asking for too much money and should find money in its budget for maintenance. The district already has too much debt and shouldn't ask for more. Property owners, especially those on fixed incomes, can't afford higher taxes. There's no guarantee that a future school board won't make changes to the projects.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-county-election-news/ci_26686487/boulder-valley-school-district-ballot-issue-3a", "modificationDate": "2014-10-12T23:28:38-0600", "sailthru.section": "Election: Boulder County & special districts", "endDate": "2024-10-08T10:16:18-0600", "description": "What it asks: \"Shall Boulder Valley School District RE-2 debt be increased $576,520,000 with a repayment cost of up to $1,351,017,635, and shall district taxes be increased up to $56,097,800 annually to pay such debt, all for the purposes described in the district's educational facilities master plan approved by the board of education and monitored by a citizens' bond oversight committee, including but not limited to the following:\n\n\n\u2014 Investing in all district schools, sites and", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:26686487:view"}, "startDate": "2014-10-12T23:27:13-0600", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-county-election-news/ci_26686487/boulder-valley-school-district-ballot-issue-3a", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "What it asks: \"Shall Boulder Valley School District RE-2 debt be increased $576,520,000 with a repayment cost of up to $1,351,017,635, and shall district taxes be increased up to $56,097,800 annually to pay such debt, all for the purposes described in the district's educational facilities master plan approved by the board of education and monitored by a citizens' bond oversight committee, including but not limited to the following:\n\n\n\u2014 Investing in all district schools, sites and", "title": "Boulder Valley School District Ballot Issue 3A"}, "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "What it asks: \"Shall Boulder Valley School District RE-2 debt be increased $576,520,000 with a repayment cost of up to $1,351,017,635, and shall district taxes be increased up to $56,097,800 annually to pay such debt, all for the purposes described in the district's educational facilities master plan approved by the board of education and monitored by a citizens' bond oversight committee, including but not limited to the following:\n\n\n\u2014 Investing in all district schools, sites and", "title": "Boulder Valley School District Ballot Issue 3A", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-county-election-news/ci_26686487/boulder-valley-school-district-ballot-issue-3a", "image": "http://local.dailycamera.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/dailycamera.png", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-10-12T23:27:13-0600", "sailthru.title": "Boulder Valley School District Ballot Issue 3A", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "news_keywords": "boulder,colorado,boulder county,louisville,lafayette,superior,longmont,candidates,city council,ballot,ballot issues", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "pubDate": "2014-10-12T23:30:23-0600", "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}}, "article_summary": "The school district is asking for too much money and should find money in its budget for maintenance.\nWhat opponents say: The school district shouldn't have allowed schools to fall into disrepair and won't maintain improvements if the measure passes.\nWhat it means: The Boulder Valley School District is asking for a $576.5 million bond issue to pay for building a new school in Erie, rebuilding three existing elementary schools, adding a centralized kitchen, repairing and renovating schools, and other capital projects.\nIf approved, it would be the largest K-12 capital construction bond issue in Boulder Valley's and Colorado's history.\nFifty percent of the bond money will be used to address critical deferred maintenance on all 55 school buildings in the district, of which 72 percent are more than 30 years old."}
