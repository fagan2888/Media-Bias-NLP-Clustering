In animal studies, uric acid has been shown to have some potential as a treatment for MS.Results of these studies led investigators in the CCLM study to search for a relationship between MS severity and levels of uric acid. In the case-control study, using propensity score matching, investigators paired 362 patients with MS and 181 control individuals without MS.To reduce variation between populations, investigators corrected data for patient age, gender, and kidney function. Upon regression analysis, investigators identified a significant association between low levels of serum uric acid among patients with MS compared with controls, with an R-squared value of 30.4% and significance determined at a P value level of 1.4%.Longer disease duration was associated with a longer time from diagnosis and a higher Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score (P < .001, all comparisons). These findings suggest that uric acid levels may be a biomarker of MS disability and progression, even though previous studies suggest that uric acid may have a limited role as a disease marker and as a therapeutic target in MS.For example, a 2006 analysis, published in the journal Clinical Neurology and Neurosurgery, found that uric acid levels did not change as a result of immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive drug treatment in patients with MS.In addition, in the ASsociation of Inosine and Interferon beta in relapsing- remitting Multiple Sclerosis (ASIIMS) trial, investigators administered a precursor of uric acid\u2014inosine\u2014to patients with MS in conjunction with interferon-beta over the course of 2 years. The results of this trial were negative, and uric acid did not have any additional benefit on disability outcomes versus interferon-beta alone.Despite the negative result of the ASIIMS trial, antioxidative drugs may have a future in treatment of MS. However, uric acid may be a biomarker\u2014 not a treatment modality. Studying uric acid may help physicians predict the progression of MS in patients, although previous research indicates that uric acid levels do not predict response to treatment,and supplementation with uric acid does not alter the progression of disability in MS.Further study will be necessary to determine whether or not drugs that mimic the effects of uric acid are of any value.1.
