The median later-stage round was $12.4 million, up from $10 million in the first quarter, and some deals far exceeded that.\n\nTopping the list was a $1.2 billion financing for ride service Uber Technologies Inc. Backers included BlackRock Private Equity Partners, Fidelity Investments and Summit Partners, the kinds of growth, public-market and private equity investors who are fueling the investment boom.\n\nThe hot investment pace, however, remains well below dot-com levels. The fourth quarter of 2000 saw $18.3 billion flow into venture-backed companies and total investment that year was $94 billion.\n\nFurthermore, venture investors aren\u2019t financing nearly as many companies as they did during the dot-com peak. Overall, the number of deals increased only modestly in the second quarter of this year, to 917 from 885 in the first quarter. In the second quarter of 2000, venture investors backed 1,759 companies.\n\nThis time around, much of the investment is going to a handful of highly valued, pre-IPO companies such as Uber. The valuation data reflect this, although it can be tricky to interpret because of its volatility quarter-to-quarter.\n\nThe median pre-money valuation of $58.3 million came on the heels of a first-quarter median of $28.4 million. The median for the half was $50.3 million, far higher than the median of $18.8 million for all of last year. Median valuation in 2000 was $25 million.\n\nReflecting the intense investor interest in companies such as Uber, room-rental service Airbnb Inc., and scrapbooking website Pinterest Inc., the consumer services segment saw a huge inflow of capital. The industry accounted for $3.88 billion of second-quarter investment, up 107% from the first quarter of 2014 and 164% from the second quarter of 2013. The number of deals barely budged, with 171 financings compared with 165 in the first quarter and 178 a year ago.\n\nThe health-care sector, which has seen a string of biotechnology IPOs this year, attracted strong investor interest with $3.01 billion flowing to 201 companies. Investment was up 33% from the first quarter. Within the industry, medical software and information services saw a 129% jump from the first quarter with 41 companies drawing $655 million.\n\nVentureSource is owned by VentureWire publisher Dow Jones & Co.\n\nWrite to Russ Garland at russell.garland@wsj.com.
