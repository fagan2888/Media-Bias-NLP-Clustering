He began work with that organization after high school, planning to stay only a year. However, after 20 years he was still with the YMCA, serving as a program manager and becoming one of 20 national training instructors.\n\n\u201cThose skills transfer and are a good fit,\u201d Wedell said of his experience.\n\nLHT provides legal services to low-income individuals who have HIV or are terminally ill. While there are other legal aid societies who assist people with HIV or a terminal illness, LHT is the only one in the United States that assists both. The organization, originally called Dallas Legal Hospice, grew and spread its umbrella to cover 16 North Texas counties. The organization changed its name in 2007, Wedell said, because it was difficult to raise money in Fort Worth when Dallas was in the title.\n\nToday, clients need information about how the Affordable Care Act is changing how they access healthcare, one of the reasons LHT is evaluating its mission. Also, medical technology has changed how cancer, Alzheimer\u2019s, renal disease and hepatitis C are treated. Advances in transplant procedures have extended patients\u2019 lives. LHT\u2019s services must evolve to address those changes. Wedell said the legal issues faced by clients with HIV have become more complex over the last decade.\n\n\u201cIn the early years, they needed a will because they were going to be dead within six months,\u201d he said.\n\nToday, attorneys spend more time on cases, such as a social security appeals or an insurance company challenging a long-term disability claim. LHT is prepared for those challenges.\n\n\u201cI was told we had a great legal staff on board and about 40 volunteer attorneys,\u201d Lokash said.\n\nLokash said the position appealed to him because of dealing with terminal illness in his own family and understanding how traumatic it can be.\n\nHe said helping people with their legal needs reduces their stress and can help with their healing or recovery.\n\nIn planning for the future, Lokash said he\u2019s listening to the needs of the community rather than providing services based on the funding and resources.\n\n\u201cThe need builds the vision,\u201d he said.\n\nOver the next year, he\u2019ll be watching the ACA carefully to see what legal issues arise and how they\u2019ll affect his clients. He hasn\u2019t seen any red flags yet, but with such a major change in the way healthcare will be covered for so many people, problems will inevitably occur.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that attracted me to Legal Hospice is that we make service delivery more barrier-free,\u201d he said.\n\nHe hopes to continue that tradition.\n\nThis article appeared in the Dallas Voice print edition December 20, 2013.\n\nComments (powered by FaceBook)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Dallas Voice", "description": "As the new executive director of Legal Hospice of Texas, Tony Lokash hopes to continue to make service delivery barrier-free   DAVID TAFFET | Staff Writer", "title": "LHT transitions to meet legal, medical changes", "url": "http://www.dallasvoice.com/lht-transitions-meet-legal-medical-10164054.html", "image": "http://www.dallasvoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Tony-Lokash.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100004508915842, "app_id": 780617392052602}, "generator": "WordPress 3.5.2", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9ff1\"", "article_summary": "\u201cOne of the things that attracted me to Legal Hospice is that we make service delivery more barrier-free,\u201d he said.\nLHT provides legal services to low-income individuals who have HIV or are terminally ill.\nThe organization, originally called Dallas Legal Hospice, grew and spread its umbrella to cover 16 North Texas counties.\nWedell said the legal issues faced by clients with HIV have become more complex over the last decade.\n\u201cI was told we had a great legal staff on board and about 40 volunteer attorneys,\u201d Lokash said."}
