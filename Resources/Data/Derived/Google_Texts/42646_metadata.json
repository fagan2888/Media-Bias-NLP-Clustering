The order was drawn at a musher\u2019s banquet Thursday night in Anchorage, and Perano got the leading spot.\n\nThe finish line is on Front Street in Nome, which runs parallel to the Bering Sea coast. Standing between the mushers and the finish line are about 1,000 miles of unforgiving Alaska terrain, including two mountain ranges, untamed wilderness, the mighty Yukon River and the wind-whipped Bering Sea coast.\n\nAmong those in the field are Mitch Seavey, last year\u2019s champion, and his son, Dallas Seavey, the 2012 winner.\n\n\u201cThe last two winners might create more media interest,\u201d Dallas Seavey said before the race started. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019re necessarily the two most competitive racers this year.\u201d\n\nAdding to the uncertainty of this year\u2019s race is an influx of Scandinavian mushers, including two-time champion Robert Sorlie.\n\nThe Sunday event in Willow is officially called the race\u2019s \u201crestart.\u201d It follows a ceremonial start Saturday in downtown Anchorage.\n\nAt that fan-friendly event, mushers talked to people and had their pictures taken for hours before their names were called to the start line. They then took their sleds on a leisurely 11-mile run on urban trails within the city, oftentimes with an auction winner, called an Iditarider, on the sled.\n\nMushers then trucked their dog teams and equipment up the Parks Highway to this community, which on clear days offers a stunning view of nearby Mount McKinley, North America\u2019s tallest peak.\n\nThe race turns serious Sunday, and mushers were busy preparing their sleds for the race.\n\nThe Iditarod has a late-afternoon start, which allows fans from both Anchorage and Fairbanks, about 250 miles to the northeast, to make the trip.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "69 mushers, hundreds of dogs prepare for Alaska\u2019s Iditarod", "title": "69 mushers, hundreds of dogs prepare for Alaska\u2019s Iditarod", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/03/01/69-mushers-hundreds-of-dogs-prepare-for-alaskas-iditarod/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140302__p_6d6ef662-4a9a-442d-9f87-a13c26014981lsoriginalph.jpg", "height": 383}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140302__p_6d6ef662-4a9a-442d-9f87-a13c26014981lsoriginalph.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-02T06:35:44+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T21:37:57+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcca72\"", "article_summary": "A New Zealand man will be the first musher en route to the town of Nome when the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race begins Sunday.\nCurt Perano and 68 other mushers will begin the world\u2019s most famous sled dog race by crossing frozen Willow Lake about 50 miles north of Anchorage.\nAt that fan-friendly event, mushers talked to people and had their pictures taken for hours before their names were called to the start line.\nThe race turns serious Sunday, and mushers were busy preparing their sleds for the race.\nThe Sunday event in Willow is officially called the race\u2019s \u201crestart.\u201d It follows a ceremonial start Saturday in downtown Anchorage."}
