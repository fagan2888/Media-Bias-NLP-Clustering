The rumor mills have started up yet again, and she's slamming it. As a matter of fact, she's laughing it off, brushing it off, and using any and every other tactic conceivable to deny the allegations that her husband, Brad Paisley, may be having an affair. The famed actress actually finds the whole debacle quite amusing. But, how did it all start?\n\nThe National Enquirer actually was the first to report the claim. Their report alleged that Paisley and fellow country music star, Carrie Underwood, had been 'hooking up.' The two recently hosted the Country Music Awards together, and shortly after, the allegations came pouring in. So, once the claims started to circulate, US Weekly decided to ask the \u201cSouthern Comfort Zone\u201d singer's wife how she felt about it all.\n\nHere we go RT @Wildaboutmusic: follow @BradPaisley, @carrieunderwood & me for behind-the-scenes #CMAawards pic.twitter.com/8BjFw5uQRH \u2014 Brad Paisley (@BradPaisley) November 6, 2013\n\nWell, according to E! News, the Nashville native was asked by US Weekly of her thoughts on the infidelity rumors when she attended the 5th Annual African Children's Choir Gala on Thursday in New York City. Williams literally burst into laughter immediately declaring the rumors to be outlandish. \"Are you serious?\u201d, she asked the publication. \u201cWow! I hope it helps our careers! That's all I can say.\"\n\nHad ball at the #CMAawards!!

We spend as much time as we can. We're very down-to-earth people. We come from good families, and we appreciate family,\u201d explained Williams-Paisley. But, she isn't the only one that's went on record for doting on her spouse. Paisley has also done the exact same thing. Paisley recently shared the story behind his latest single, \u201cI Can't Change the World,\u201d with iHeartRadio. The song was actually inspired by his wife. It's also a verbal expression of the feelings he felt when the two first started dating over 12 years ago.\n\niheartRadio News also reported that Paisley spoke of the sentiments he shared with her before they decided to take on a commitment with their relationship. He said that he \u201cwasn't sure what she was looking for, and admitted he had his limits, but would do everything he could for her.\"\n\nSo, it's safe to say the rumor was just that where the Paisleys are concerned. The two have been married since March of 2004. They have two children together; Huck, 6; and Jasper, 4.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/rnoa7qFHjC4\n\nImage(s) via Twitter | Kimberly Williams-Paisley", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "WebProNews", "description": "Kimberly Williams-Paisley won't even entertain it.
