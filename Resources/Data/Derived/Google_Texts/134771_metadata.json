At JAT, Connor ranked as the firm's top performing investment analyst.\n\n\"Our portfolio construction is designed to create a balanced portfolio and position us to be opportunistic in noisy and volatile markets,\" Connor wrote in the letter.\n\nHe hired three former JAT analysts - Abhinav Kumar, Matt Hostetler, and Andrew Johnston - and Ray Bao, who used to work for prominent technology investor Dan Benton's Andor Capital.\n\nConnor is launching his fund at a time many hedge funds are in the red - the average fund is off 2 percent this year, according to Hedge Fund Research. Analysts are noting that many of the themes the worked last year, including bets on tech stocks like Amazon and Netflix, are losing money this year.\n\n(Reporting by Svea Herbst-Bayliss; Editing by Bill Trott)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/03/08/Former-JAT-Capital-partner-Chris-Connor-launches-hedge-fund", "type": "article", "site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "\"We are now actively putting capital to work,\" Connor wrote in a letter to investors a", "title": "Former JAT Capital partner Chris Connor launches hedge fund"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/03/08/Former-JAT-Capital-partner-Chris-Connor-launches-hedge-fund", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "\"We are now actively putting capital to work,\" Connor wrote in a letter to investors a", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Connor had worked at John Thaler's JAT Capital from 2007 until the fund returned investors' capital in 2015.\nConnor is launching his fund at a time many hedge funds are in the red - the average fund is off 2 percent this year, according to Hedge Fund Research.\n\"We are now actively putting capital to work,\" Connor wrote in a letter to investors and friends, dated Monday and seen by Reuters on Tuesday.\nAt JAT, Connor ranked as the firm's top performing investment analyst.\nThe fund started trading with $120 million in assets and has committed capital of as much as $200 million."}
