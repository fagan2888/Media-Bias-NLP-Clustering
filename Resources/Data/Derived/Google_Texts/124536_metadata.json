Dave Brat (R-Va.) meets with pilots from the Air Line Pilots Association at his office in the Cannon House Office Building in Washington. Amanda Voisard/For The Washington Post\n\nRep. Dave Brat, who shocked the political establishment by defeating Eric Cantor in a primary, is adjusting to his new life.\n\nRep. Dave Brat, who shocked the political establishment by defeating Eric Cantor in a primary, is adjusting to his new life.\n\nRep. Dave Brat, who shocked the political establishment by defeating Eric Cantor in a primary, is adjusting to his new life.\n\nRep. Dave Brat, the Virginia Republican, awoke on a recent morning in his U.S. Capitol office, a suite that has doubled as his Washington bedroom since he pulled off what may be the most astonishing political upset in a generation.\n\nIf a mattress on the floor seems like a dubious reward for toppling House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, Brat betrays nothing less than gusto as he settles into the few-frills life of a freshman lawmaker.\n\nBy 9:30 that morning, the congressman was at a cramped round table a few feet from his receptionist, nodding with vigor as three airline pilots briefed him on something called the FAA Reauthorization Act.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s getting this?\u201d Brat asked his hovering aides before excusing himself to walk a long hallway, then another, for a meeting that was over before he arrived. Then it was downstairs to a budget hearing, where a full 84 minutes passed before the chairman called on him to ask a question.\n\nA bit more than a year ago, voters in Virginia\u2019s 7th Congressional District were represented by Cantor, one of Washington\u2019s most powerful men, with dominant influence over key committee chairmanships in the House of Representatives and over whether legislation lived or died.\n\nRep. Dave Brat (R-Va.) holds a town hall style meeting at Beaverdam Baptist Church. (Reza A. Marvashti/ For the Washington Post)\n\nBack home in his heavily Republican district, that power was not universally admired. Cantor alienated constituents who perceived him as more interested in the trappings of Washington than their conservative ideals. In the GOP primary last June, they embraced Brat, 50, an unknown economics professor at the time whose chief virtue was that he was not Eric Cantor.\n\nCantor\u2019s fall has meant an unquestionable loss of clout in the House for voters of the 7th District and Virginia overall. Their new leader is another face in a swarm of 435 lawmakers, albeit one known as the \u201cDragon Slayer,\u201d as one passing Republican colleague greeted Brat in the hallway that morning.\n\nSo what did Virginia get in the bargain? Driven by tea party activists, Brat\u2019s victory was interpreted as evidence that conservative voters would reject Republicans who temper their views. Yet, whether that conclusion endures is an open question, as establishment Republicans won several primaries in Virginia this month.\n\n[In Virginia, the GOP establishment battles back \u2014 for the White House]\n\nA second puzzle is whether Brat is the fleeting beneficiary of anti-Cantor fervor or has what it takes to build and maintain command over a district stretching from the James River in southeastern Virginia to rural horse country west of Washington.\n\nSince joining Congress, Brat has aligned with his party\u2019s most conservative caucus, and he voted against John A. Boehner\u2019s reelection as House speaker. Brat also has learned that his every pronouncement can face scrutiny, sometimes with less than pleasing results.\n\nRuss Moulton, a leading conservative activist in Virginia, said Brat\u2019s opposition to Boehner reaffirmed his status as \u201cone of our big heroes.\u201d\n\nRep. Dave Brat (R-Va.) held a town hall meeting at Beaverdam Baptist Church last month in Hanover County. Brat met with constituents and answered questions from a mostly tea party-affiliated crowd. (Reza A. Marvashtit/for The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cIt told me we had someone who is remaining consistent with what he believes,\u201d Moulton said. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t going to Washington and being consumed by the Borg.\u201d\n\nYet, Linwood Cobb, a Cantor ally, said the congressman\u2019s Boehner vote suggested that \u201che\u2019s appealing to the fringe. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s representing the majority of residents in his district.\u201d\n\nDespite his opposition to Boehner, as well as Cantor, Brat insists on describing himself as a \u201cunifying force\u201d who is championing his party\u2019s core principles. As for whether Cantor\u2019s exit diminished Virginia\u2019s standing in the House, Brat said: \u201cThe goal is not to amass the most power. It\u2019s to represent the people. Their voice is now heard.\u201d\n\nAs he spoke, the congressman was on his way to the Small Business Committee, where he sat at the far end of the dais and smiled as the chairman distilled the life of a freshman lawmaker.\n\n\u201cYou get here,\u201d the chairman said, \u201cand you think, \u2018How did I get here?\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u2018If you\u2019re not bawlin\u2019 . . . \u2019\n\nOn a Monday night, Brat traveled to a tea party-sponsored community meeting in Mechanicsville, where conservative activists distributed fliers and pamphlets, including one titled \u201cThe Muslim Brotherhood in the Obama Administration.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy the end of this, if you\u2019re not bawlin\u2019 you\u2019re not American,\u201d Brat said before reading a proclamation and presenting a flag to a retired Campbell\u2019s Soup salesman who was one of his campaign volunteers.\n\nAfter a standing ovation, Brat talked of his new life \u201cup there\u201d in Washington, mixing in barbs for the likes of President Obama\u2019s energy secretary (\u201cHe\u2019s got the bad hairdo\u201d) and Hillary Rodham Clinton, who he suggested could end up in prison garb for erasing State Department e-mails (\u201cShe looks good in orange.\u201d).\n\nWhen a woman asked whether Obama \u201ccould go for a third term,\u201d Brat replied, \u201cThat would be the end. Patrick Henry and the rifles would be coming out \u2014 that wouldn\u2019t be good.\u201d\n\nBrat likes to portray himself as a man of modest tastes, telling an audience that in Washington, \u201cI\u2019m fighting against guys who drink lattes.\u201d (Days later, after voting on the House floor, he expressed interest in a cappuccino.) When a stranger complimented him on his watch, Brat volunteered that he \u201cgot it half off at Nordstrom.\u201d\n\nAs much as he postures as a plain-spoken Washington outsider, Brat is the image of the insider, with his rimless glasses, dark suits and a smile made for television. He acknowledges that a political career was his long-term ambition as he earned a master\u2019s degree at Princeton Theological Seminary, a doctorate in economics at American University and a teaching post at Randolph-Macon College in Ashland, about 90 miles south of Washington.\n\nA decade ago, Brat volunteered as an assistant for state Sen. Walter Stosch (R-Henrico), an establishment Republican who became his political mentor. With Stosch\u2019s financial help, Brat mounted his first campaign in 2011 for a House of Delegates seat, and he was angry when other Republican leaders, including Cantor, helped anoint a politically connected opponent.\n\n[Virginia delegate and son of Dominion CEO says he is his own man]\n\n\u201cHe felt he was so qualified that no one should consider the other individuals running,\u201d said Don Boswell, a Henrico County Republican leader. \u201cHe expressed his displeasure to me to the effect that this was another case of the backroom political establishment making the decision.\u201d\n\nThree years later, Brat took on Cantor, despite discouragement from Stosch and others who didn\u2019t think he had a chance. As the election approached and another Cantor sweep seemed imminent, Brat sensed he had the support at 60 percent of the doors on which he was knocking as he talked of Republican principles and issues such as the need for term limits.\n\nConservative radio host Laura Ingraham gave Brat a big boost, but it was a Cantor television ad that portrayed Brat as liberal that may have done the most to publicize his underdog bid. \u201cWe\u2019d go to people\u2019s doors,\u201d said Phil Rapp, Brat\u2019s campaign manager, \u201cand they\u2019d say, \u2018That\u2019s the professor from the ad. He\u2019s a liberal?\u2019 \u201d\n\nA year later, as Brat travels his district, he said he gets \u201cno pushback or negativity\u201d from Cantor allies.\n\nBut it may be unwise to view silence as acceptance.\n\n\u201cThere were significantly hard feelings that are still around,\u201d Boswell said. \u201cI regret losing the influence we had with Cantor.\n\n\u201cDave was in the right place at the right time,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that was an extreme anomaly.\u201d\n\nBeyond beating Cantor\n\nBetween meetings one afternoon, Brat was in his office in the Cannon House Office Building, eating a tuna sandwich that an aide had delivered from the cafeteria downstairs. A portrait of James Madison hung on a wall. On another was a rendering of Jesus on a boat in a storm.\n\n\u201cI thought it was a good metaphor for the office,\u201d the congressman said, his words alternating with the sound of crunching chips.\n\nBrat described his new job as an \u201coverwhelmingly huge thought project,\u201d one that does not make him miss the teaching gig he gave up for Congress. \u201cThis is better. In academia, you get to study it. Here you get to do it.\u201d\n\nBrat is aware that he may always be known as \u201cthe guy who beat Eric Cantor,\u201d as Glenn Beck, the conservative television host, referred to him recently \u2014 and that whatever Brat accomplishes in Congress may be overshadowed forever by that feat. The way to top his victory, he said, is: \u201cI do something for people. You\u2019ve got to get something done.\u201d\n\nWhat Brat is pushing is a balanced budget amendment, an idea that has been proposed by others. He also has embraced a full menu of conservative talking points, decrying the national debt and criticizing the Affordable Care Act and amnesty for undocumented immigrants.\n\nOne aspect of Washington politics Brat said he disdains is how \u201cscripted\u201d his colleagues can be. Yet Brat himself is capable of disciplined answers, particularly when a question is pointed.\n\nOne apparently sensitive spot is his link to Stosch, his mentor, who is more moderate than the conservative activists who backed Brat\u2019s victory last year. While Brat worked for him, Stosch supported tax increases that tea party leaders oppose.\n\nAsked during an interview whether he favored the tax increases that Stosch backed, Brat said: \u201cI didn\u2019t support them or not support them. It wasn\u2019t my role.\u201d\n\nThen he said: \u201cI don\u2019t want to say anything. He was my mentor.\u201d\n\nAt other moments, his discipline seems to falter.\n\nOn several occasions, he has talked of \u201c2,000\u201d Syrian refugees having crossed American borders \u201clast month\u201d or \u201ctwo months ago.\u201d He describes the refugees as having been \u201cun-vetted\u201d by immigration officials, a statement he repeated during a radio interview in which he added that Syria \u201cis the home of ISIS.\u201d\n\nAsked during the interview to cite evidence for his assertion, Brat said, \u201cI don\u2019t use anything unless I\u2019ve checked it umpteen times.\u201d Then, turning to Julia Hahn, his press secretary, the congressman asked, \u201cJulia, do you know?\u201d\n\nBrian Gottstein, Brat\u2019s communications director, later acknowledged that, despite the congressman\u2019s statements, 2,000 Syrian refugees have not arrived, though they are \u201cexpected by this fall or sooner.\u201d\n\nThe FBI has testified that it \u201cdoesn\u2019t have adequate information to separate legitimate refugees from potential terrorists,\u201d Gottstein said. \u201cRep. Brat, along with others, has sounded the alarm on this fact.\u201d\n\n\u2018Blurred\u2019 reply on term limits\n\nAt a community meeting in Beaverdam on another Monday, Brat complained that a reporter had twisted his words to suggest he was comparing undocumented immigrants to terrorists when he criticized a proposal to invite such immigrants to enlist in the military.\n\n\u201cI always said I loved every single person in the world,\u201d Brat said as he spent nine minutes criticizing the Richmond Times-Dispatch article, including the choice of a photo that he said showed him scowling.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s called bias,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter completing his critique, he asked the crowd, \u201cWhat else do you need to raise your blood pressure?\u201d\n\nSomeone thanked him for representing the district. Someone else asked, \u201cWhat will it take to have Hillary arrested?\u201d\n\nA man stood and told the congressman that the issue that \u201cdrew me to you was the concept of term limits.\u201d\n\nBrat recalled his campaign promise to serve no longer than 12 years, but he then volunteered that he was supporting a bill that would set the limit at 20 years.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a magical number,\u201d he said. Days later, he would explain that 20 years was \u201cbetter than nothing.\u201d\n\nBut that night, in the last row, Buzz Foster, a retired state police officer who voted for Brat, wasn\u2019t sure what to make of the congressman\u2019s response.\n\n\u201cIt was a little blurred,\u201d Foster said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t answer it. He didn\u2019t really say he\u2019d put it in motion.\u201d\n\nHe sighed and shook his head.", "article_metadata": {"description": "After deposing Eric Cantor, U.S. Rep.
