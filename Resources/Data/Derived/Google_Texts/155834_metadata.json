This incredibly common procedure is rarely shown outside a tragic context \u2014 with notable exceptions including Greenberg, Friday Night Lights, and Obvious Child.\n\nBut what about birth control, which is also very much under attack politically? Fifty-five years ago today, the FDA approved Enovid, the first oral contraceptive pill in the world, and 50 years ago this month, Griswold v. Connecticut affirmed the right to privacy that legalized birth control. Yet today the pill and other methods \u2014 along with insurance coverage for them \u2014 have become political footballs again. Remember the fight over Obamacare\u2019s no-copay birth control? It\u2019s still echoing through the halls of power.\n\nRight now, Republican senator Kelly Ayotte wants to make birth control over the counter \u2014 which would improve its accessibility in theory but also make it costly for many women \u2014 while her Democratic colleague, Patty Murray, wants it to be OTC and covered by insurance. \u201cAs members of the Senate debate what a future with over-the-counter birth control might look like, some of their colleagues are sticking to the older, more puritanical fights over reproductive rights,\u201d Meredith Clark wrote last week at Refinery29. \u201cOn Tuesday, House Republicans issued a proposal that would eliminate all Title X funding, which offers grants for groups to provide contraceptive and preventative health care to low-income women,\u201d effectively cutting off that group\u2019s birth control.\n\nWith so much at stake, and so many women using it, why doesn\u2019t birth control appear more often in pop culture? There are many reasons, but the primary one is how it might function in a plot. Condoms and diaphragms often do show up, in novels and even in films (although not nearly often enough) \u2014 but other kinds of birth control, whether an IUD, a pack of pills, a shot, a ring, or a patch, are rarely seen, discussed, or even mentioned. Unfortunately, there\u2019s little interesting or plot-advancing about taking the same small pill every day. Something that by its very nature creates freedom \u2014 an absence of risk and worry \u2014 isn\u2019t easy to depict in genres that rely on conflict. And on the flip side, a character forgetting multiple doses of oral contraceptives is hardly as convenient a plot device as scrambling, in the heat of the moment as it were, to find a condom or even worse, having it break. For the latter, think about the absurd scene in Knocked Up which shows the condom being manhandled and ultimately discarded.\n\nThere are a few exceptions, however:\n\nIn Mad Men\u2018s premiere, Peggy\u2019s now-infamous visit with the slut-shaming doctor who is nonetheless known as a permissive type who will give women prescriptions for the pill. Unfortunately, it\u2019s too late for her, since she sleeps with Pete too early and ends up pregnant without knowing it.\n\nAnother great example of non-hormonal female birth control being central to a plot is the infamous Seinfeld episode, \u201cThe Sponge,\u201d in which Elaine\u2019s favorite brand of contraceptive sponge is taken off the market. With only a few boxes left, she is forced to evaluate potential suitors based on their sponge-worthiness.\n\nIn the Romanian film 4 Months, 3 Weeks, and 2 Days, the girls are seen sharing and trading packs of pills on the black market, which explains why so many of them end up getting underground abortions.\n\nAn episode of 30 Rock featured a pregnancy scare for Liz Lemon that involved a frantic scramble through a stack of birth control packs, in classic Liz Lemon style (as well as multiple tainted pregnancy tests, corrupted by cheese curls).\n\nAnd of course, there\u2019s Loretta Lynn\u2019s song, \u201cThe Pill.\u201d\n\nBut Lynn\u2019s song was released in the \u201970s. Today, the pickings remain slim. One cultural shift, however, has been in writing. Over the past few years, as the pill became a hot topic, personal essays about birth control \u2014 loving it, hating it, needing it \u2014 have proliferated. In the current era of the first-person narrative, birth control is being normalized in writing. And as that millennial aesthetic, both feminist and confessional, seeps from online essays and lists into broader pop culture, we may be seeing a lot more art about the pill in years to come.\n\nOne can hope such a shift will shield birth control from political attack, but I wouldn\u2019t count on it.", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Pages and pages of feminist ink have\u00a0been spilled\u00a0about the lack of abortion scenes on screen, and how that turns abortion into something of\u00a0a\u00a0taboo, despite its presence in many people's lives.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "Flavorwire", "description": "Pages and pages of feminist ink have\u00a0been spilled\u00a0about the lack of abortion scenes on screen, and how that turns abortion into something of\u00a0a\u00a0taboo, despite its presence in many people\u2019s liv\u2026", "title": "Why Aren\u2019t There More Depictions of Birth Control in Pop Culture?", "url": "http://flavorwire.com/524392/why-arent-there-more-depictions-of-birth-control-in-pop-culture", "image": {"width": 1000, "identifier": "https://flavorwire.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/peggy-bc.jpg", "height": 564}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://flavorwire.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/peggy-bc.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "@flavorwire", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@flavorwire"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "p": {"domain_verify": "d14fb4bfdccbc45ec9b9cf467123426d"}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://flavorwire.com/feed;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/5af1ea63c8deb1c43404735fce2401ed?s=16", "application-name": "Flavorwire", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WordPresscom", "published_time": "2015-06-23T18:16:55+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-25T00:42:58+00:00"}, "keywords": "activism, buzz, film, pop culture, television, 30 rock, friday night lights, griswold v. connecticut, loretta lynn, mad men, obvious child, seinfeld", "google-site-verification": "LEPlfEAe87ZYYO-w5cvjSSIHi6-qE8orVaxsi6TkE9Y", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/flavorwire-2016/img/ms-icon-144x144.png"}, "article_summary": "With so much at stake, and so many women using it, why doesn\u2019t birth control appear more often in pop culture?\nOne can hope such a shift will shield birth control from political attack, but I wouldn\u2019t count on it.\nBut what about birth control, which is also very much under attack politically?\nRemember the fight over Obamacare\u2019s no-copay birth control?\nIn the current era of the first-person narrative, birth control is being normalized in writing."}
