Webb has found it both exciting and challenging to work for a more rural medical center, but has taken advantage of opportunities to expand the center\u2019s services by spearheading esophageal motility studies.\n\nThe demand for health care is growing, yet more than 80 positions remain unfilled at Olympic Medical Center.\n\nAvailable positions widely vary from, but aren\u2019t limited to, medical assistants, registered nurses, an accountant, housekeepers and a psychiatrist to an orthopedic surgeon.\n\nThe numbers of doctors entering the medical field aren\u2019t keeping pace with the increasing demand, leaving a \u201chuge\u201d shortage in areas like primary care, according to Eric Lewis, Olympic Medical Center chief executive officer.\n\n\u201cThere is a national shortage in health care providers and that creates a competitive situation,\u201d Lewis said.\n\nOMC, also known as Clallam County Public Hospital District No. 2, provides inpatient and outpatient services in Clallam County and is a designated sole community hospital and rural referral center by Medicare. An 80-bed acute-care hospital, level-three trauma designated emergency department, surgical services and labor and delivery fall under the umbrella of OMC centered in Port Angeles.\n\nAdditionally, OMC provides a variety of outpatient services such as physical therapy, laboratory, nutrition and diabetes, home health, primary care, a walk-in clinic and cancer care in both Port Angeles and Sequim.\n\n\n\n\n\nA growing demand\n\nAs a rural medical center, OMC isn\u2019t excused from the impacts associated with the surge of people entering the national health care system, but its more rural setting can instead cause more challenges.\n\n\u201cMost of our positions require advanced education, and finding, but also retaining people with advanced education is often more difficult in rural communities,\u201d Lewis said.\n\nThe U.S. health care system is \u201calready strained,\u201d according to the Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, yet it faced an influx of patients in 2014 after most major provisions of the Affordable Care Act were phased in, allowing \u201c32 million Americans\u201d access to health insurance for the first time.\n\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, referred to as Obamacare, was signed into law by President Barack Obama in 2010. Shortly following, the Affordable Care Act and expansion of Medicaid eligibility was implemented in Washington in 2013 and it is among 25 other states to have expanded Medicaid coverage.\n\nLocally, Lewis estimates about 5,000-6,000 more people in Clallam County have health insurance as a result of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAdditionally, as individuals born between the years 1946-1964, categorized as \u201cbaby boomers\u201d by the U.S. Census Bureau, reach retirement age, they\u2019re requiring more specialized medical attention, as well as retiring from the medical field themselves.\n\nIn an effort to meet medical demands spurred by both the shifts in health care coverage and the aging population, OMC official are actively seeking more staff. Beyond simply meeting the area\u2019s health care demands, Lewis said, OMC officials are continuously working to enhance and develop the services they provide.\n\nTo keep up with the demand, infrastructure as well as personnel are needed. Structurally, among the most recent enhancements at OMC is a 42,000-square-foot medical office building under way at the Port Angeles campus and in Sequim, OMC officials are considering a capital campaign in 2016 to expand the cancer center.\n\n\u201cEvery building in Sequim, we\u2019d like to make bigger,\u201d Lewis said.\n\n\n\n\n\nLocal challenges\n\nDeepening the widespread challenges facing health care, Clallam County has its own unique obstacles when it comes to not only recruiting people, but more importantly the right people and retaining them.\n\n\u201cHere the challenge is finding the right people that also want to live here,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cRelocating is a complex decision to make, especially if they\u2019re married or have children.\u201d\n\nBecause of the county\u2019s rural setting there isn\u2019t the diversity of jobs readily found in more urban areas, nor does the area offer the same amount of the amenities, nightlife, ease of transportation or selection of restaurants that a city can. However, Lewis noted the rural setting also has a lot of offer someone who\u2019s interested in that kind of lifestyle.\n\nThe lack of community support to pass a proposed $49.3 million Sequim School District construction bond earlier this month is concerning to OMC officials hoping to bring in younger, skilled medical professionals as well as to those like Bill Greenwood, Clallam County Economic Development Corporation executive director.\n\nSchools are a large part of recruiting because medical professionals \u201cpay a lot of attention (to schools),\u201d Lewis said.\n\n\u201cDoctors got where they are at because they invested in education,\u201d he said.\n\nThe resistance to upgrade and expand the public school system goes beyond creating challenges for recruiting medical professionals to the area, but \u201cIt\u2019s fouling up our opportunities to expand this economy,\u201d Greenwood said. Without a growing economy it can be difficult for the spouses of professionals interested in moving to the area to find employment, Greenwood said.\n\n\u201cThis (problem) goes beyond health care,\u201d he said.\n\nDespite the variety of challenges, OMC\u2019s job listings get plenty of interest, but that doesn\u2019t mean every applicant is right for the position, Lewis said.\n\n\u201cWe may get a lot of interest, but we also want to hire excellent employees,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re more concerned with retention \u2014 that\u2019s always something we\u2019re working on.\u201d\n\nEven when OMC officials are able to fill positions with the right people, their efforts often break even with the number of professionals retiring from health care industry, Lewis explained.\n\nPrograms offered at Peninsula Community College help to combat some of the staffing and health care demands at OMC, Lewis said, but many of the positions needing filled require more education than what\u2019s available at the college.\n\n\u201cWe tell them where we need (staffing) \u2026 and they\u2019re (Peninsula Community College) expanding,\u201d he said, \u201cBut it takes time.\u201d\n\nReflecting both the nationwide and local challenges to recruit and retain, the number of available positions at OMC \u201cis definitely a little higher,\u201d but it\u2019s not uncommon for the center to have around 50 positions open at any given time, as it employs 1,200 people, Lewis said.\n\n\u201cRight now there\u2019s way more demand than supply of trained professionals. It takes about 10-12 years to train a physician,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re definitely hiring, there are just some serious headwinds.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nOpportunity\n\nGastroenterologist Duane Webb joined Olympic Medical Center about a year and a half ago \u2014 allowing OMC to have two gastroenterologists on staff. Still, Webb\u2019s department is shorthanded and thus he\u2019s heading the recruitment process for another gastroenterologist.\n\nThe position has been open for about five months and has generated \u201csome\u201d interest, he said.\n\nTo Webb, the ideal recruits for OMC are medical professionals in the midst of their career seeking change and/or new challenges.\n\nWhen recruiting for a gastroenterologist, Webb highlights the area\u2019s rural lifestyle with fairly close proximity to Seattle or Victoria, the lack of traffic, mild weather and ample outdoor recreational opportunities \u2014 all reasons he and his wife were drawn to the area.\n\nStill, it\u2019s a \u201ccompetitive situation\u201d given there are a lot of jobs out there for medical grads coming out of their fellowships, Webb said.\n\nSince working at OMC, Webb has been impressed with the way the center is flexible with the scheduling to allow for many part-time doctors not quite ready to retire to stay involved.\n\n\u201cThis helps to fill the voids, especially in primary care,\u201d he said.\n\nOMC officials also work with surrounding resources and partners like Swedish Medical Center to continue to build the Rural Family Medicine Residency program where health care professionals do one year at Swedish and next two years on the peninsula.\n\nOMC as an affiliate of a larger health care network like Swedish was another plus to Webb when accepting his position at OMC and relocating from Vancouver. Additionally, before coming on with OMC, officials with the center committed to funding and supplying the equipment needed for Webb to pursue an interest of his and offer a specialized service \u2014 esophageal motility studies.\n\nAlthough Webb only has had the equipment to actively do esophageal function motility studies for about one month, he\u2019s already referred one patient to Swedish Medical Center based on the data collected. The ability for Webb to provide his patient with specialized care locally and gather his own data saved the patient three trips and a one-night stay in Seattle, he said.\n\n\u201c(OMC) is a great opportunity for people wanting to grow and implement new services,\u201d Webb said. \u201cI think there\u2019s a huge demand here and for people that are passionate about that, then it\u2019s exciting \u2014 that was my case.\u201d\n\nReach Alana Linderoth at alinderoth@sequimgazette.com.
