Some Gulf States do have Patriot Missile Defense systems, but the equipment isn\u2019t compatible with one another\u2013making the building of a missile defense shield in the region a moot point at present. Defense One reported that rivalries and concerns about cyber espionage have become obstacles in this matter:\n\n\u2026\n\nWhile the missile\u2019s target may be in Saudi Arabia, it would travel over UAE, Qatar or Kuwait. America\u2019s friends have sophisticated, American-made missile interceptors. But there\u2019s one problem, the equipment in one country does not talk to the equipment in another. So, the United States is renewing its push during this week\u2019s Gulf Cooperation Council summit outside Washington to get Arab states to link-up the missile interceptors and radars into a single Middle East missile shield.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t just buy lots of interceptors and park them in the desert,\u201d said Thomas Karako, a missile defense expert with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, or CSIS. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to stitch them together into the network and give them plenty of early warning and sensor information so they know where to shoot.\u201d\n\nGCC members are united in their fear of nuclear missile attacks from Iran, but regional politics, military rivalries and even cyber espionage concerns have blocked them from setting up an intertwined missile defense shield akin to what NATO has built in Europe. There, alliance members have been beefing up missile defenses to protect the continent from long-range Iranian missiles.\n\n\u201cThe difference is that you don\u2019t have NATO in the Middle East,\u201d Karako said. \u201cReally the prerequisite to serious cooperation, to serious interoperability and integration is and always has been the lack of political integration and \u2026 security integration like you have with NATO.\u201d\n\n\u2026\n\nSaudi Arabia purchased $2 billion worth of Patriots last month and Qatar signed a $2.4 billion deal for interceptors in December. As Patriot orders have come in from the Middle East and elsewhere, Raytheon has funded upgrade and improvement projects for the missile.\n\nUAE also has purchased the THAAD interceptors, built by Lockheed Martin, and are supposed to get them by the end of the year. Saudi Arabia and Qatar are also reportedly interested in THAAD.\n\nThe U.S. has 10 Patriot batteries deployed in the region, including one in Jordan to defend against a possible missile attack from Syria.\n\nBut while the Gulf States have purchases top-end missile interceptors, they do not have the sophisticated radars and satellites that the Pentagon uses to track ballistic missiles.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Not a lot of time....05/26/2016 5:17:27AM EST.", "author": "Matt Vespa", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Not a lot of time...", "title": "Matt Vespa - Iran Missile Launch Leaves Neighbors With Four-Minute Reaction Time", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2015/05/19/iran-missile-launch-leaves-neighbors-with-four-minute-reaction-time-n1999475", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/231/2014-08-20T030506Z_1_LYNXMPEA7J02H_RTROPTP_3_MIDEAST-GAZA.JPG", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Not a lot of time...", "title": "Matt Vespa - Iran Missile Launch Leaves Neighbors With Four-Minute Reaction Time", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2015/05/19/iran-missile-launch-leaves-neighbors-with-four-minute-reaction-time-n1999475", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/231/2014-08-20T030506Z_1_LYNXMPEA7J02H_RTROPTP_3_MIDEAST-GAZA.JPG", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Iran Missile Launch Leaves Neighbors With Four-Minute Reaction Time, Matt Vespa, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb790\"", "article_summary": "Some Gulf States do have Patriot Missile Defense systems, but the equipment isn\u2019t compatible with one another\u2013making the building of a missile defense shield in the region a moot point at present.\nAmerica\u2019s friends have sophisticated, American-made missile interceptors.\nBut while the Gulf States have purchases top-end missile interceptors, they do not have the sophisticated radars and satellites that the Pentagon uses to track ballistic missiles.\nAs negotiations over Iran's nuclear ambitions continue, it should be noted that in the event of an Iranian missile launch, neighboring Middle Eastern countries only have four minutes of reaction time.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t just buy lots of interceptors and park them in the desert,\u201d said Thomas Karako, a missile defense expert with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, or CSIS."}
