(WLFI) \u2013 A shortage of substitute teachers may force the Lafayette School Corporation to hire an outside vendor, which could cost the district more than $100,000.\n\nLSC Associate Superintendent John Layton informed the school board Monday evening that the district only has an 87 percent fill rate for teacher absences, a steep drop from 97 percent just two years ago and 91 percent last year.\n\nLayton believes the statewide teacher shortage, as well as the strong economy, has shrunk the pool of qualified subs. There\u2019s also now new limits due to the Affordable Care Act that keep the district from using the same sub more than three days a week. Otherwise, the district must offer health care benefits, which brings an extra cost which is prohibitive to the corporation.\n\nSubbing currently costs the district about $500,000 a year. Hiring an outside vendor might add an extra $125,000 to that, but administrators believe it might be worth it.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t have a qualified sub, then pretty much mindless things are going on in the classroom like worksheets,\u201d said Layton. \u201cWe\u2019ve moved so far beyond those days where we just fill time with kids. We don\u2019t have time to do that.\u201d\n\nA vendor would provide training and benefits to the substitutes.\n\nLayton says there are a few dozen Hoosier districts which have already hired similar services. He adds the next step for LSC is more research and getting some answers to questions board members had Monday night.\n\nShare this: Email\n\nPrint\n\nTwitter\n\nFacebook\n\nGoogle\n\nMore\n\nPinterest\n\nLike this: Like Loading...", "article_metadata": {"description": "LAFAYETTE, Ind.
