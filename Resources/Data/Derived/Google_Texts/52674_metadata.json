His wife, Um Mohammed, told the Norwegian Refugee Council:\n\nIs this what our lives have come into? Living in a shack after we invested all what we had to build a house? I am very depressed and feel unable to take care of my children. I used to help them with their studies; their performance at school is now deteriorating. I feel no hope for the future or reconstruction. I am afraid we will spend the rest of our lives in this shack, in suffering and despair.\n\nIn their joint statement, the organizations lay out some of the ongoing problems:\n\nsince July, the situation has deteriorated dramatically. Approximately 100,000 Palestinians remain displaced this winter, living in dire conditions in schools and makeshift shelters not designed for long-term stay. Scheduled power cuts persist for up to 18 hours a day. The continued non-payment of the salaries of public sector employees and the lack of progress in the national unity government further increases tensions. With severe restrictions on movement, most of the 1.8 million residents are trapped in the coastal enclave, with no hope for the future. Bearing the brunt of this suffering are the most vulnerable, including the elderly, persons with disabilities, women and nearly one million children, who have experienced unimaginable suffering in three major conflicts in six short years. Children lack access to quality education, with over 400,000 of them in need of immediate psychosocial support.\n\n\u201cI am afraid we will spend the rest of our lives in this shack, in suffering and despair.\u201dThe statement adds that \u201cIsrael, as the occupying power, is the main duty bearer and must comply with its obligations under international law,\u201d and concludes: \u201cWe must not fail in Gaza.\u201d\n\nIn an update earlier this month, UNRWA said a funding shortfall had forced it \u201cto suspend its cash assistance program supporting repairs and providing rental subsidies to Palestine refugee families in Gaza,\u201d and Oxfam pointed to the responsibility of the international community as well.\n\n\u201cOnly an end to the blockade of Gaza will ensure that people can rebuild their lives,\u201d Catherine Essoyan, Oxfam\u2019s Regional Director, said in a media statement.\n\n\u201cFamilies have been living in homes without roofs, walls or windows for the past six months. Many have just six hours of electricity a day and are without running water. Every day that people are unable to build is putting more lives at risk. It is utterly deplorable that the international community is once again failing the people of Gaza when they need it most,\u201d Essoyan stated.\n\nBut Electronic Intifada co-founder Ali Abunimah writes that little change to the dire situation will come if aid agencies continue to make appeals to the vague \u201cinternational community\u201d and avoid putting blame on \u201cthe home governments of many of the international civil society organizations have been complicit in Israel\u2019s military attacks and siege on Gaza.\u201d\n\nHe continues: \u201cAid agencies should not have waited six long months to speak out. Now that they have done so, they should have called for specific punitive measures against the party they correctly call the \u2018occupying power\u2019 to force it to end its siege.\u201d\n\n\u201cIsrael, moreover, could not carry on the way it does without the complicity of \u2018Western\u2019 governments: the aid agencies should hold their governments accountable and pressure them to end their complicity,\u201d Abunimah writes.\n\nHuman rights organizations Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have issued reports finding that some of Israel\u2019s actions during the summer assault amounted to war crimes, but the head of a UN war crimes inquiry into the operation announced his resignation this month, stating: \u201cThis work in defense of human rights appears to have made me a huge target for malicious attacks.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "'Only an end to the blockade of Gaza will ensure that people can rebuild their lives.' \u2014Catherine Essoyan, Oxfam", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Andrea Germanos | Common Dreams", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "'Only an end to the blockade of Gaza will ensure that people can rebuild their lives.' \u2014Catherine Essoyan, Oxfam", "title": "Oxfam: Could Take 100 Years To Rebuild Gaza", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/rebuild/202661/", "image": "https://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Mideast-Israel-Palest_Muha1-001.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-02-28T01:18:18-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "'Only an end to the blockade of Gaza will ensure that people can rebuild their lives.' \u2014Catherine Essoyan, Oxfam", "creator": "@MintPressNews", "image": "https://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Mideast-Israel-Palest_Muha1-001.jpg", "title": "Oxfam: Could Take 100 Years To Rebuild Gaza", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Daily Digest", "tag": "Palestine", "published_time": "2015-02-28T05:00:33-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-28T01:18:18-05:00"}}, "article_summary": "\u201cOnly an end to the blockade of Gaza will ensure that people can rebuild their lives,\u201d Catherine Essoyan, Oxfam\u2019s Regional Director, said in a media statement.\nThe organization\u2019s statement comes six months after a ceasefire agreement ended Israel\u2019s 50-day assault on Gaza, which left over 2,100 Palestinians dead, decimated thousands of structures, and weakened already damaged infrastructure systems.\nA Palestinian girl sits inside a room of her family\u2019s building which was damaged in last summer\u2019s Israel-Hamas war, in the Shijaiyah neighborhood of Gaza City, northern Gaza Strip, Monday, Feb. 23, 2015.\nIt is utterly deplorable that the international community is once again failing the people of Gaza when they need it most,\u201d Essoyan stated.\nDespair and destruction continue to envelop the blockaded Gaza strip, where the rebuilding of vital structures could take up to a century, Oxfam International has warned."}
