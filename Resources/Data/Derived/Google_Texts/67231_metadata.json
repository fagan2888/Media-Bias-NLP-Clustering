The unions submitted a complaint to the National Labor Relations Board.\n\nThe IBEW local negotiator said the company had no interest in working with the striking workers, and a spokeswoman for the company said the unions made no proposals.\n\nAt the protest Tuesday, workers from both the IBEW local, which represents about 1,700 members in Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont, and the Communications Workers of America Local 1400, which represents nearly 300 workers in those three states, stood outside the Senator Inn waving signs at passers-by. Winton said most workers were from Lewiston and points north.\n\nPeter Keefe, a splice service technician from Hebron, said the company has gone after workers\u2019 health care, pensions and job security by trying to contract out work.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve gone after everything,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re in the fight of our lives, and we know it. We\u2019re dug in and we\u2019re ready.\u201d\n\nKeefe, 43, said the strike has affected him, because without health insurance, he\u2019s expecting a hefty bill after his son needed treatment at the hospital.\n\nThe company recently asked workers to return to work in Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont, saying that the old contract was out of sync with the rest of the industry, according to the Associated Press.\n\n\u201cThere is no lockout,\u201d Mike Reed, FairPoint\u2019s president in Maine, told the AP. \u201cIf they want to return to the workforce, then they need only to call their supervisor.\u201d\n\nThe chamber forum at the Senator Inn was focused on the federal Affordable Care Act and what mandates will affect Maine businesses in the next two years.\n\nKrista MacKay, of South Gardiner, said she joined her fellow union members Tuesday to send a message to FairPoint.\n\nMacKay, 48, said as a result of losing her insurance during the strike, she\u2019s been unable to afford all of her prescriptions and has to choose which to buy herself.\n\n\u201cRight now, I\u2019m without health insurance, and hopefully nothing catastrophic happens,\u201d MacKay said. \u201cA lot of people are in the same boat.\u201d\n\nPaul Koenig \u2014 621-5663\n\n[email protected]\n\nTwitter: @paul_koenig", "article_metadata": {"description": "The workers said they were protesting a health care forum because health insurance is a key issue in their dispute with FairPoint Communications.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Central Maine", "description": "The workers said they were protesting a health care forum because health insurance is a key issue in their dispute with FairPoint Communications.", "title": "FairPoint workers protest outside Senator Inn in Augusta - Central Maine", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 300, "identifier": "http://www.centralmaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/347475_457204-fairpoint1.jpg", "height": 200}, "updated_time": "2014-12-02T18:54:35-04:00", "url": "http://www.centralmaine.com/2014/12/02/fairpoint-workers-protest-outside-senator-inn-in-augusta/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.centralmaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/347475_457204-fairpoint1.jpg", "description": "The workers said they were protesting a health care forum because health insurance is a key issue in their dispute with FairPoint Communications.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "FairPoint workers protest outside Senator Inn in Augusta - Central Maine"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=966680591", "fb": {"app_id": 754222714628811}, "article": {"section": "Local & State", "published_time": "2014-12-02T09:13:01-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-02T18:54:35-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "DT-FwcrUrXtAltcTNXUsA7tR4Ha0CLErawYbGlkpg94", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "AUGUSTA \u2014 More than 30 FairPoint Communications union workers protested on Tuesday outside the Senator Inn and Spa because FairPoint co-sponsored a Maine State Chamber of Commerce forum on health insurance.\n\u201cRight now, I\u2019m without health insurance, and hopefully nothing catastrophic happens,\u201d MacKay said.\nRelated Headlines Unions dismiss FairPoint invitation to return to work Additional Images Krista MacKay, of South Gardiner, right, holds a sign while picketing Tuesday outside a health care conference in Augusta sponsored in part by FairPoint Communications.\nHowever, a spokeswoman for FairPoint said that even though the workers lost their health insurance when they walked off the job, they still have other options for coverage.\nPeter Keefe, a splice service technician from Hebron, said the company has gone after workers\u2019 health care, pensions and job security by trying to contract out work."}
