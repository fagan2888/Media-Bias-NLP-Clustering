The grading system, which began in 2010 under then-Mayor Michael Bloomberg, assigns restaurants a grade, generally A, B or \"grade pending.\"\n\nDuring his campaign for mayor last year, Mr. de Blasio promised to lower the fines, which some restaurant owners and industry advocates have said are unfair and too costly.\n\nThe drop in projected revenue from the restaurant grading program includes a 15% reduction in the dollar amount of fines incurred by restaurants that receive health violations, officials said.\n\nThe overhaul will also offer \"consultative, penalty-free inspections\" to restaurants that request them in addition to official inspections. The final rules on the new system are expected to be released by the agency next week, officials said.\n\nThe amount of money in fines collected by the city's health department was $40.4 million in fiscal 2013, down from its peak of $52 million in fiscal 2012.\n\nWrite to Mara Gay at mara.gay@wsj.com", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "article.created":
