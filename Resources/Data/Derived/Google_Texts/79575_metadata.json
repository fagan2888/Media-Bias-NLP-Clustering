Mike Feuer.\n\nA criminal complaint filed Friday in L.A. County Superior Court charged the garage business owner, Steven Garcia, with 60 misdemeanors, including unlawfully taking a motor vehicle, refusing to accept payments by credit card and charging an excessive rate for towing and storage.\n\nTwo drivers for Valley Impound Garage face nine total misdemeanor charges including operating without proper city and state permits and refusing to release a car to an owner who arrived before it was towed away.\n\nThe owner of the parking lot where the cars were towed was charged with 10 misdemeanor counts of not contracting with a tow company with proper permits.\n\n\u201cHolding vehicles ransom and charging excessive fees for their release is an outrageous and unscrupulous business practice,\u201d Feuer said in a prepared statement. \u201cMy office will continue to crack down on predatory businesses, hold their operators accountable, and protect Los Angeles drivers.\u201d\n\nEach count carries a maximum penalty of six months in jail and a $1,000 fine.\n\nInterested in the stories shaping California?

His attorney, David Kestenbaum, said he could not comment on the charges because his client had not been served with a copy of the criminal complaint.\n\n\u201cI just caution the press that these complaints are made by people who have illegally parked in lots that have the required signage about parking restrictions,\u201d Kestenbaum wrote in an email.\n\nHe added that he works across the street from the Van Nuys Courthouse and watches people bypass the city's parking lot in favor of the small lot next to his law office. \u201cPeople look at all the signs and decide to save $10,\u201d Kestenbaum said. \u201cThen they lie about how long they had been there.\u201d\n\nOne driver who parked in the Northridge lot went into a hair salon and beauty supply store on Reseda Boulevard, Feuer's office said. Twenty-five minutes later, her car was towed, the office said. California law requires that tow truck drivers wait one hour before towing vehicles that are parked illegally in commercial lots.\n\nThe driver told investigators the tow truck driver demanded $120 in cash to retrieve her car \u201con the spot,\u201d or $280 to recover it from the tow yard in Van Nuys.\n\n\u201cThat is the basic pattern for all the cases,\u201d city attorney spokesman Rob Wilcox said.\n\nEric Rose, the executive director of the Official Police Garage Assn. of Los Angeles, which represents the city's 18 licensed impound lots, said the law is clear that tow truck drivers must wait at least an hour after a vehicle is parked illegally before removing it from a commercial parking lot.\n\n\u201cPeople make mistakes, and they need to have a chance to come retrieve their cars,\u201d said Rose, whose group does not include Valley Impound Garage.\n\nTowing companies are required to charge rates set by local governments. L.A.'s towing fee is $121. The daily fee at the impound lot is $38.\n\nOfficials said those who believe they have been towed illegally by Valley Impound Garage can contact the city attorney's office at (213) 978-8340 or the Los Angeles Police Commission's towing complaint hotline at (323) 680-4TOW\n\nFor more Los Angeles transportation news, follow @laura_nelson on Twitter.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Impound firm accused of predatory towing in Northridge", "Description": "Los Angeles city prosecutors have filed criminal charges against four people tied to a towing operation accused of using \u201cpredatory practices\u201d to target drivers who left cars at a Northridge parking lot.From September 2014 to January 2015, drivers for Valley Impound Garage towed 10 vehicles from...", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "Los Angeles city prosecutors have filed criminal charges against four people tied to a towing operation accused of using \u201cpredatory practices\u201d to target drivers who left cars at a Northridge parking lot.", "title": "Impound firm accused of predatory towing in Northridge", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-predatory-towing-20150817-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56fd643a/turbine/la-l-a-times-logo-20160331/600", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp15.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/84225562", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2015-08-17", "y_key": "cee2fe4077f8d050", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "googlebot": "index"}, "article_summary": "Los Angeles city prosecutors have filed criminal charges against four people tied to a towing operation accused of using \u201cpredatory practices\u201d to target drivers who left cars at a Northridge parking lot.\nThe daily fee at the impound lot is $38.\nCalifornia law requires that tow truck drivers wait one hour before towing vehicles that are parked illegally in commercial lots.\nThe owner of the parking lot where the cars were towed was charged with 10 misdemeanor counts of not contracting with a tow company with proper permits.\n\u201cMy office will continue to crack down on predatory businesses, hold their operators accountable, and protect Los Angeles drivers.\u201dEach count carries a maximum penalty of six months in jail and a $1,000 fine."}
