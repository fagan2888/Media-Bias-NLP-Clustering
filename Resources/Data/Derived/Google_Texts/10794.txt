It was conscience over party for state Rep. Dan Thurlow, R-Grand Junction, as he voted “no” on four bad gun bills last week. Monday night’s committee hearings went late into the night, ending with a victory for Colorado gun safety advocates, but really for all of Colorado, with a Republican voting alongside Democrats for common-sense gun laws. Thurlow showed courage and made a firm statement that Republicans can cross party lines on this issue.
