A police chief delivered a roadside baby, his own daughter, on Interstate 70 in the mountains Tuesday with the help of a police dispatcher.

Eagle Police Chief Joey Staufer called 911 at about 2 a.m. to report his wife, Vio, was in labor at the Gypsum off-ramp exit of the highway.

Kelly Klein, a Vail police dispatcher, fielded the call and helped Staufer deliver his first child, a girl.

“This is why I got into emergency services, for experiences like this,” Klein said in a Vail media release.

Eagle County paramedics and emergency responders with the Gypsum Fire Protection District arrived shortly after the birth.

Vio and her daughter were transported to a local hospital where both are “doing well,” according to the release.

Klein, who has worked at the police department’s communication center for less than a year, will be recognized with a “pink stork pin” and will have his name inscribed on a communications center plaque, according to the release.
