Matisyahu refused.\n\n\u201cThe festival organizers contacted me because they were getting pressure from the BDS movement. They wanted me to write a letter, or make a video, stating my positions on Zionism and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to pacify the BDS people. I support peace and compassion for all people\u2026Were any of the other artists scheduled to perform asked to make political statements in order to perform? \u201d Matisyahu said.\n\nRemember: this is Spain. These are the folks who brought you the Spanish Inquisition, the expulsion in 1492, and who are now inviting descendants of the expelled to return and regain the Spanish citizenship that was stripped from their ancestors.\n\nHere is what happened. People condemned the festival for singling Matisyahu out as a Jew. Even the Spanish government protested.\n\nSo, the festival backtracked.\n\n\u201cRototom Sunsplash rejects anti-Semitism and any form of discrimination towards the Jewish community,\u201d read a statement from the festival. \u201cWe respect both their culture as religious beliefs and we sincerely apologize for what has occurred.\u201d\n\nWelcome to the cultural war against the Jews.\n\nDon\u2019t think that Matisyahu is alone.\n\nTake Rabbi Bob Alper, whose \u201cpulpit\u201d is comedy.\n\nBob has been performing with Arab Muslim comedians (including Egyptian-American Ahmed Ahmed and Palestinian-American Mo Amer) in an effort to bring peace through shared laughter.\n\nBob and his comic colleagues recently performed in Israel. They were supposed to perform together in Ramallah, in the heart of the Palestinian Authority, having already performed in (Palestinian) East Jerusalem.\n\nExcept, Bob wasn\u2019t allowed to perform.\n\nYou see, the folks in Ramallah don\u2019t like Israelis that much. The only Israelis they tend to see are soldiers.\n\nBut it\u2019s worse than that. As Bob says:\n\nWhen I told him [the producer of the event] I was not an Israeli (!), he responded that it didn\u2019t matter, and that the only way the audience would like me would be if I started by, basically, renouncing Israel, Zionism, supporting the BDS movement, and placed myself somewhere to the left of Norman Finkelstein (his words, not my gloss) [Finkelstein is a prominent anti-Zionist academic]\n\nWhen I said that what I do is try to humanize \u201cthe other\u201d in both directions (as do Ahmed Ahmed and Mo Amer when we perform together), he said that is unacceptable, since it \u201cnormalizes\u201d the current situation.\n\nAnd people accuse Israel of apartheid?\n\nIn Ramallah, they have comedic apartheid.\n\nOK \u2014 back to Spain and Matisyahu.\n\nAccording to the late historian Benzion Netanyahu, the Spanish Inquisition was the beginning of modern racism. It was all about limpieza de sangre, the purity of blood.\n\nThe BDS people no longer care about the purity of blood.\n\nFor them, it\u2019s about the purity of ideas.\n\nJews are free to be Jewish.\n\nBut they are not free to support Israel or its institutions in any way, because Zionism is an impure idea.\n\nIn sixth grade parlance, it gives you the cooties. No one will sit with you in the cafeteria.\n\nJust as medieval Spanish Jews had to convert to Christianity, contemporary Jews must convert to anti-Zionism.\n\nBack in early modern Europe, if Jews wanted to be acceptable in polite society, they had to cut off their payis (earlocks), forget their Yiddish, and ditch the customs and dress that would mark them as the Other.\n\nTwo hundred years later \u2014 today \u2014 if Jews want to be acceptable in \u201cpolite\u201d (read: left-wing, academic, and European) society, they have to rid themselves of their otherness.\n\nWhich means, Zionism.\n\nMatisyahu and Bob Alper did the Nancy Reagan bit: they just said \u201cno.\u201d They refused to separate their Jewish religious identity from their Jewish national identity.\n\nThe title of Matisyahu\u2019s latest album is \u201cAkedah\u201d \u2014 Abraham\u2019s near-sacrifice of his son, Isaac.\n\nMatisyahu refused to sacrificially slaughter his Judaism on the Moriah of Euro-acceptability.\n\nMatisyahu is, as they say, a rock star. He is a hero for young Jews. \u201cYou don\u2019t like me as I am \u2013a Jew who cares about Judaism, and a Jew who cares about his people, and a Jew who cares about his land? Tough.\u201d Ultimately, his music won out.\n\nAnd Rabbi Bob Alper? As sweet as they come. Totally non-political. As he put it: \u201cI just wanted to make people laugh.\u201d\n\nBut his cancelled gig in Ramallah is a wake up call.\n\nWe can remind the world and ourselves that shalom and salaam have the same Semitic root. We can laud musician David Broza\u2019s efforts in making that happen. And we can certainly give Bob Alper a thumbs up for his outstretched hand, which, most of the time, has been accepted lovingly.\n\nBut, Ramallah. What does it say that in Ramallah, a Jewish and Zionist comedian is as welcome as, well, last week\u2019s humus?\n\nAs Matisyahu would sing: One day\u2026.one day this will all be different. One day there will be wider co-existence. One day, Jews and Arabs in Ramallah will be able to sit and actually laugh together.\n\nBut at this precise moment, that day seems even further away.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Beliefs, Culture, Opinion, Ahmed Ahmed, anti-Semitism, BDS, Bob Alper, Christian, Interfaith, Israel", "generator": "Easy Digital Downloads v2.5.16", "og": {"site_name": "Religion News Service", "description": "Two American Jewish performers learn that Jew hatred extends to the concert stage.", "title": "No Jews and Zionists allowed!", "url": "http://religionnews.com/2015/08/20/no-jews-and-zionists-allowed/", "image": "http://religionnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/shutterstock_263610437.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@RNS", "card": "summary"}, "syndication-source": "http://religionnews.com/2015/08/20/no-jews-and-zionists-allowed/", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://religionnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-RNS_logo_RGB-336x336.gif", "original-source": "http://religionnews.com/2015/08/20/no-jews-and-zionists-allowed/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "Two American Jewish performers learn that Jew hatred extends to the concert stage."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd259\"", "article_summary": "Just as medieval Spanish Jews had to convert to Christianity, contemporary Jews must convert to anti-Zionism.\nOne day, Jews and Arabs in Ramallah will be able to sit and actually laugh together.\n\u201cWe respect both their culture as religious beliefs and we sincerely apologize for what has occurred.\u201dWelcome to the cultural war against the Jews.\nWhat does it say that in Ramallah, a Jewish and Zionist comedian is as welcome as, well, last week\u2019s humus?\nExcept, Bob wasn\u2019t allowed to perform."}
