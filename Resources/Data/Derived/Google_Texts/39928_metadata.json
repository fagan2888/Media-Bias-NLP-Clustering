Paul Wieland won an appeal, today (7-20), in his fight against the Affordable Care Act\u2019s mandated birth control coverage. The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the lower court\u2019s rejection of his legal challenge, which will allow Sen. Wieland\u2019s case, based on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision last year in Hobby Lobby, to proceed.\n\n\u201cThe government has no business forcing parents to pay for coverage of abortion drugs and devices that violate their religious beliefs,\u201d said Wieland. \u201cThis decision is a win for religious liberty.\u201d\n\nLast year, the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis heard arguments by Republican State Sen. Paul Wieland of Imperial and his wife, Teresa, against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and two other federal agencies.\n\nAs a legislator, Sen. Wieland pays for his family\u2019s insurance coverage through the Missouri Consolidated Health Care Plan (MCHCP), a group health care plan made available to employees of the State of Missouri. The Senator was allowed to opt out of coverage for contraceptive methods contrary to his Catholic faith prior to the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, but that choice was taken away in August of 2013.\n\nLast year, the Wieland\u2019s lawyer, Timothy Belz, urged the three-judge panel to reverse the U.S. District Court\u2019s November 2013 ruling dismissing the case. He cited the Supreme Court\u2019s decision that private companies with religious objections, such as Hobby Lobby, can opt out of the contraceptive requirement under the federal health care law and said that parents should have at least as many rights as does Hobby Lobby. The Wielands have three daughters.\n\nThe United States Supreme Court ruled in Hobby Lobby that for-profit employers can be exempt from following the HHS Mandate under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, because their exercise of religious faith is substantially burdened when the government forces them to provide religiously objectionable insurance coverage for their employees. Today\u2019s unanimous decision allows the Wielands to pursue their claim that their religious freedom, as individuals and as parents, should also be protected under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Missouri Times", "description": "ST LOUIS\u2014Missouri lawmaker Sen.
