President Barack Obama appeared on Funny or Die’s “Between Two Ferns with Zach Galifianakis” to pitch ObamaCare. Lately, the President has been aggressively pushing for young people to sign up for his signature health care plan — a necessity if the program is going to be financially viable. ObamaCare desperately needs the young and healthy to overpay for health insurance as a way to cover the costs of the less healthy.

It comes as no surprise that Funny or Die would be willing to participate in something that promotes a mandated and centralized federal government program. The left-wing Funny or Die was co-founded by comedy director Adam McKay and comedian Will Ferrell. For years, both have been active in protecting and promoting the establishment.
