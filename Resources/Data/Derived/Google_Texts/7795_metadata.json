This begs the question \u2014 what are some other areas in which the administration has failed, in terms of our basic freedoms?\n\nWithout further ado, here they are, in no particular order:\n\nThe Top 5 Freedom Blunders by the United States Government\n\n1. IRS as Political Big Brother\n\nIn 2010, the IRS cobbled together a \u201cBe On The Lookout\u201d list to help identify politically active groups as targets for scrutiny. Keywords included \u201cPatriots,\u201d \u201cTea Party,\u201d \u201cGovernment Spending,\u201d and \u201cIsrael,\u201d and covered subjects such as Constitutional Education and inquiries into the Affordable Care Act.\n\nSome claimed it also targeted conservative-leaning groups almost exclusively. For example, although the Occupy Movement was targeted, according to the Republican-led House Oversight Committee, it and the small number of other liberal groups listed didn\u2019t receive nearly the scrutiny of conservative groups.\n\n2. The Invisible Rulebook for Identifying Terrorists\n\nIn March 2013, the National Counterterrorism Center released a 166-page document called the March 2013 Watchlisting Guidance, detailing the U.S. government\u2019s rules for placing people on its terrorist watch list.\n\nIt was officially declassified. But the White House refused to release it, then it wound up being published in full by The Intercept. If it was declassified, why refuse to let the public see it openly?\n\n3. Free Speech on Campus\n\nIn response to the University of Montana\u2019s dealings with sexual assault, the Department of Education and the Department of Justice teamed together and issued a letter to the school, intended as a national blueprint for handling sexual harassment.\n\nAmong other things, the letter urged a lockdown on \u201cunwelcome speech\u201d on campus. It also insisted that matters be processed through extra-judicial procedures that support punishment before trial, lack of legal representation for \u201cdefendants,\u201d and convictions based on a \u201cguilty before proven innocent\u201d standard more reminiscent of Judge Dredd than of a modern democracy.\n\n4: N-S-Ayy, May I Listen in on Your Conversation?\n\nDespite Obama\u2019s talks of reform in 2014, the NSA still wields the power to conduct surveillance on cell phone data. In addition, the FBI may still seize records without a court order. Tough call, but unconstitutional government spying and a carte blanche for a federal agency to collect private papers without due process don\u2019t seem like hallmarks of a free society.\n\nOh, and there was the Senate\u2019s Cybersecurity Bill, which would increase information sharing among the \u2018intelligence community\u2019 and expand NSA surveillance powers.\n\n5: Freedom of Information Acting Rather Strange Lately\n\nThe Bush administration\u2019s policy of refusing requests for records to the Office Of Administration became policy under the Obama administration this week, in case you missed it. The irony: it was announced on National Freedom of Information Day.\n\nWhile it\u2019s fair to say that Obama didn\u2019t start this one and that several other departments, disturbingly, also make it policy to refuse such requests, taking such action on the day meant to celebrate\u2026.freedom of information sure takes some sand.", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "These don't seem like hallmarks of a free society...", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=878142436", "og": {"site_name": "Independent Journal Review", "description": "These don't seem like hallmarks of a free society...", "title": "Top 5 Freedom Blunders by the US Government That Show Just How 'Transparent' We Really Are", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 628, "identifier": "http://static.ijreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/obama-press-conference1.jpg", "height": 368}, "updated_time": "2015-03-18T18:24:04-04:00", "url": "http://www.ijreview.com/2015/03/273936-top-five-freedom-blunders-us-govt/", "type": "article"}, "is_article": 1, "twitter": {"description": "These don't seem like hallmarks of a free society...", "title": "Top 5 Freedom Blunders by the US Government That Show Just How 'Transparent' We Really Are", "image": "http://static.ijreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/obama-press-conference1.jpg", "creator": "@injo", "site": "@injo", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Jed Smith", "robots": "noodp", "DC.date.issued": "2015-03-18T18:00:46-04:00", "wp-categories": "482 1471", "fb": {"admins": 1116123001, "app_id": 251714254848821}, "p": {"domain_verify": "770b5b250556c52fa42a70dc373c541b"}, "published_at": "2015-03-18T18:00:46+00:00", "url": "http://www.ijreview.com/2015/03/273936-top-five-freedom-blunders-us-govt/", "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "wp-category-slugs": "nation, politics", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/injoreview/", "section": "Nation", "published_time": "2015-03-18T18:00:46-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-18T18:24:04-04:00"}, "post_id": 273936, "image": "http://static.ijreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/obama-press-conference1.jpg", "tags": "Politics", "is_https": 0}, "article_summary": "The irony: it was announced on National Freedom of Information Day.\nWithout further ado, here they are, in no particular order:The Top 5 Freedom Blunders by the United States Government1.\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Fresh off the AP wire Wednesday is news that the Obama administration has set a new record for denying and censoring government files.\n5: Freedom of Information Acting Rather Strange LatelyThe Bush administration\u2019s policy of refusing requests for records to the Office Of Administration became policy under the Obama administration this week, in case you missed it.\nThis begs the question \u2014 what are some other areas in which the administration has failed, in terms of our basic freedoms?"}
