That\u2019s not a quarterback barking out signals. That\u2019s the list of my five favorite Psalms. My least favorite may have been the long and seemingly repetitious Psalm 119, but Michigan pastor Kevin DeYoung\u2019s Taking God at His Word: Why the Bible Is Knowable, Necessary, and Enough, and What That Means for You and Me (Crossway, 2014) has changed that. DeYoung showed me that 119, the Bible\u2019s longest chapter, is a love poem \u201cnot about marriage or children or food or drink or mountains or sunsets or rivers or oceans, but about the Bible itself.\u201d Below, by publisher permission, is the first chapter of Taking God at His Word. DeYoung wants us to love in the Bible \u201cnot just the obviously theological parts. Not just the memorable stuff. Not just the parts that resonate with us. All of it\u2014history, chronology, philosophy\u2014every truth the Bible affirms ought to be taken as God\u2019s truth. Every word in the Bible is there because God wanted it there.\u201d We see you\u2019ve been enjoying the content on our exclusive member website.

This book begins in a surprising place: with a love poem. Don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not from me. It\u2019s not from my wife. It\u2019s not from a card, a movie, or the latest power ballad. It\u2019s not a new poem or a short poem. But it is most definitely a love poem. You may have read it before. You may have sung it, too. It\u2019s the longest chapter in the longest book in the longest half of a very long collection of books. Out of 1,189 chapters scattered across 66 books written over the course of two millennia, Psalm 119 is the longest.[1] And for good reason. This particular psalm is an acrostic. There are 8 verses in each stanza, and within each stanza the 8 verses begin with the same letter of the Hebrew alphabet. So verses 1\u20138 all begin with aleph, verses 9\u201316 with beth, verses 17\u201324 with gimel, and on and on for 22 stanzas and 176 verses\u2014all of them exultant in their love for God\u2019s word. In 169 of these verses, the psalmist makes some reference to the word of God. Law, testimonies, precepts, statutes, commandments, rules, promises, word\u2014this language appears in almost every verse, and often more than once in the same verse. The terms have different shades of meaning (e.g., what God wants, or what God appoints, or what God demands, or what God has spoken), but they all center on the same big idea: God\u2019s revelation in words. Surely it is significant that this intricate, finely crafted, single-minded love poem\u2014the longest in the Bible\u2014is not about marriage or children or food or drink or mountains or sunsets or rivers or oceans, but about the Bible itself. The Poet\u2019s Passion I imagine many of us dabbled in poetry way back when. You know, years before you had kids, before you got engaged, or, if you\u2019re young enough, before last semester. I\u2019ve written a few poems in my day, and even if we were best friends I still wouldn\u2019t show them to you. I\u2019m not embarrassed by the subject matter\u2014writing for and about my lovely bride\u2014but I doubt the form is anything to be proud of. For most of us, writing a love poem is like making cookies with wheat germ\u2014it\u2019s supposed to be the real thing but doesn\u2019t taste quite right. Some love poems are amazing, like Shakespeare\u2019s Sonnet 116: \u201cLet me not to the marriage of true minds admit impediments. Love is not love which alters when it alteration finds,\u201d and all that jazz. Beautiful. Brilliant. Breathtaking. Other poems, not so much. Like this poem I found online by a man reliving his teenage romantic genius: Look! There\u2019s a lonely cow\n\nHay! Cow!\n\nIf I were a cow, that would be me\n\nIf love is the ocean, I\u2019m the Titanic.\n\nBaby I burned my hand on\n\nThe frying pan of our love\n\nBut still it feels better\n\nThan the bubble gum that hold us together\n\nWhich you stepped on Words fail, don\u2019t they? Both in commenting on the poem and in the poem itself. Still, this bovine- and bubble gum\u2013themed piece of verbal art does more with subtlety and im\u00adagery than the entry entitled \u201cPurse of Love\u201d: Girl you make me\n\nBrush my teeth\n\nComb my hair\n\nUse deodorant\n\nCall you\n\nYou\u2019re so swell\n\nI suppose this poem may capture a moment of real sacri\u00adfice for our high school hero. But whatever the earnestness of intention, it is strikingly bad poetry. Most poems written when we are young and in love feel, in retrospect\u2014how shall we say?\u2014a bit awkward. This is partly because few teenagers are instinctively good poets. It\u2019s about as common as cats being instinctively friendly. But the other reason our old love poems can be painful to read is that we find ourselves uncomfortable with the exuberant passion and extravagant praise. We think, \u201cYikes! I sound like a nineteen-year-old in love. I can\u2019t believe I was so over-the-top. Talk about melodramatic!\u201d It can be embarrassing to get reacquainted with our earlier unbounded enthusiasm and unbridled affection, especially if the relationship being praised never worked out or if the love has since grown cold. I wonder if we read a poem like Psalm 119 and feel a bit of the same embarrassment. I mean, look at verses 129\u2013136, for example: Your testimonies are wonderful; therefore my soul keeps them.\n\nThe unfolding of your words gives light; it imparts understanding to the simple.\n\nI open my mouth and pant, because I long for your commandments.\n\nTurn to me and be gracious to me, as is your way with those who love your name.\n\nKeep steady my steps according to your promise, and let no iniquity get dominion over me.\n\nRedeem me from man\u2019s oppression, that I may keep your precepts.\n\nMake your face shine upon your servant, and teach me your statutes.\n\nMy eyes shed streams of tears, because people do not keep your law. This is pretty emotional stuff\u2014panting, longing, weeping streams of tears. If we\u2019re honest, it sounds like high school love poetry on steroids. It\u2019s passionate and sincere, but a little unrealistic, a little too dramatic for real life. Who actually feels this way about commandments and statutes? Finishing at the Start Crossway Kevin DeYoung I can think of three different reactions to the long, repetitive passion for the word of God in Psalm 119. The first reaction is, \u201cYeah, right.\u201d This is the attitude of the skeptic, the scoffer, and the cynic. You think to yourself, \u201cIt\u2019s nice that ancient people had such respect for God\u2019s laws and God\u2019s words, but we can\u2019t take these things too seriously. We know that humans often put words in God\u2019s mouth for their own purposes. We know that every \u2018divine\u2019 word is mixed with human thinking, redaction, and interpretation. The Bible, as we have it, is inspiring in parts, but it\u2019s also antiquated, indecipherable at times, and frankly, incorrect in many places.\u201d The second reaction is \u201cHo, hum.\u201d You don\u2019t have any particular problems with honoring God\u2019s word or believing the Bible. On paper, you have a high view of the Scriptures. But in practice, you find them tedious and usually irrelevant. You think to yourself, though never voicing this out loud, \u201cPsalm 119 is too long. It\u2019s boring. It\u2019s the worst day in my Bible reading plan. The thing goes on forever and ever saying the same thing. I like Psalm 23 much better.\u201d If the first reaction is \u201cYeah, right\u201d and the second reaction is \u201cHo, hum,\u201d the third possible reaction is \u201cYes! Yes! Yes!\u201d This is what you cry out when everything in Psalm 119 rings true in your head and resonates in your heart, when the psalmist perfectly captures your passions, your affections, and your actions (or at least what you want them to be). This is when you think to yourself, \u201cI love this psalm because it gives voice to the song in my soul.\u201d The purpose of this book is to get us to fully, sincerely, and consistently embrace this third response. I want all that is in Psalm 119 to be an expression of all that is in our heads and in our hearts. In effect, I\u2019m starting this book with the conclusion. Psalm 119 is the goal. I want to convince you (and make sure I\u2019m convinced myself) that the Bible makes no mistakes, can be understood, cannot be overturned, and is the most important word in your life, the most relevant thing you can read each day. Only when we are convinced of all this can we give a full-throated \u201cYes! Yes! Yes!\u201d every time we read the Bible\u2019s longest chapter. Think of this chapter as application and the remaining seven chapters of this book as the necessary building blocks so that the conclusions of Psalm 119 are warranted. Or, if I can use a more memorable metaphor, think of chapters 2 through 8 as seven different vials poured into a bubbling cauldron and this chapter as the catalytic result. Psalm 119 shows us what to believe about the word of God, what to feel about the word of God, and what to do with the word of God. That\u2019s the application. That\u2019s the chemical reaction produced in God\u2019s people when we pour into our heads and hearts the sufficiency of Scripture, the authority of Scripture, the clarity of Scripture, and everything else we will encounter in the remaining seven chapters. Psalm 119 is the explosion of praise made possible by an orthodox and evangelical doctrine of Scripture. When we embrace everything the Bible says about itself, then\u2014and only then\u2014will we believe what we should believe about the word of God, feel what we should feel, and do with the word of God what we ought to do.\n\nWhat Should I Believe about the Word of God? In Psalm 119 we see at least three essential, irreducible characteristics we should believe about God\u2019s word. First, God\u2019s word says what is true. Like the psalmist, we can trust in the word (v. 42), knowing that it is altogether true (v. 142). We can\u2019t trust everything we read on the Internet. We can\u2019t trust everything we hear from our professors. We certainly can\u2019t trust all the facts given by our politicians. We can\u2019t even trust the fact-checkers who check those facts! Statistics can be manipulated. Photographs can be faked. Magazine covers can be airbrushed. Our teachers, our friends, our science, our studies, even our eyes can deceive us. But the word of God is entirely true and always true: God\u2019s word is firmly fixed in the heavens (v. 89); it doesn\u2019t change.\n\nThere is no limit to its perfection (v. 96); it contains nothing corrupt.\n\nAll God\u2019s righteous rules endure forever (v. 160); they never get old and never wear out. If you ever think to yourself, \u201cI need to know what is true\u2014what is true about me, true about people, true about the world, true about the future, true about the past, true about the good life, and true about God,\u201d then come to God\u2019s word. It teaches only what is true: \u201cSanctify them in the truth,\u201d Jesus said; \u201cyour word is truth\u201d (John 17:17). Second, God\u2019s word demands what is right. The psalmist gladly acknowledges God\u2019s right to issue commands and humbly accepts that all these commands are right. \u201cI know, O LORD, that your rules are righteous,\u201d he says (Ps. 119:75). All God\u2019s commandments are sure (v. 86). All his precepts are right (v. 128). I sometimes hear Christians admit that they don\u2019t like what the Bible says, but since it\u2019s the Bible they have to obey it. On one level, this is an admirable example of submitting oneself to the word of God. And yet, we should go one step further and learn to see the goodness and rightness in all that God commands. We should love what God loves and delight in whatever he says. God does not lay down arbitrary rules. He does not give orders so that we might be restricted and miserable. He never requires what is impure, unloving, or unwise. His demands are always noble, always just, and always righteous. Third, God\u2019s word provides what is good. According to Psalm 119, the word of God is the way of happiness (vv. 1\u20132), the way to avoid shame (v. 6), the way of safety (v. 9), and the way of good counsel (v. 24). The word gives us strength (v. 28) and hope (v. 43). It provides wisdom (vv. 98\u2013100, 130) and shows us the way we should go (v. 105). God\u2019s verbal revelation, whether in spoken form in redemptive history or in the covenantal documents of redemptive history (i.e., the Bible), is unfailingly perfect. As the people of God, we believe the word of God can be trusted in every way to speak what is true, command what is right, and provide us with what is good. What Should I Feel about the Word of God? Too often, Christians reflect on only what they should believe about the word of God. But Psalm 119 will not let us stop there. This love poem forces us to consider how we feel about the word of God. We see that the psalmist has three fundamental affections for God\u2019s word. First, he delights in it. Testimonies, commandments, law\u2014they are all his delight (vv. 14, 24, 47, 70, 77, 143, 174). The psalmist can\u2019t help but speak of God\u2019s word in the deepest emotive language. The words of Scripture are sweet like honey (v. 103), the joy of his heart (v. 111), and positively wonderful (v. 129). \u201cMy soul keeps your testimonies,\u201d writes the psalmist; \u201cI love them exceedingly\u201d (v. 167). But some people say, \u201cI will never love the word of God like this. I\u2019m not an intellectual. I don\u2019t listen to sermons all day. I don\u2019t read all the time. I\u2019m not the sort of person who delights in words.\u201d That may be true as a general rule, but I\u2019ll bet there are times you get passionate about words on a page. We all pay attention when the words we are hearing or reading are of great benefit to us, like a will or an acceptance letter. We can read carefully when the text before us warns of great danger, like instructions on an electrical panel. We delight to read stories about us and about those we love. We love to read about greatness, beauty, and power. Do you see how I\u2019ve just described the Bible? It\u2019s a book with great benefit to us, and one with grave warnings. It is a book about us and those we love. And most of all, it\u2019s a book that brings us face-to-face with One who possesses all greatness, beauty, and power. To be sure, the Bible can feel dull at times, but taken as a whole it is the greatest story ever told, and those who know it best are usually those who delight in it most.\n\nOver and over, the psalmist professes his great love for the commands and testimonies of God (vv. 48, 97, 119, 127, 140). The flip side of this love is the anger he experiences when God\u2019s word is not delighted in. Hot indignation seizes him because of the wicked, who forsake God\u2019s law (v. 53). Zeal consumes him when his foes forget God\u2019s words (v. 139). The faithless and disobedient he looks upon with disgust (v. 158). The language may sound harsh to us, but that\u2019s an indication of how little we treasure the word of God. How do you feel when someone fails to see the beauty you see in your spouse? Or when people don\u2019t see what makes your special-needs child so special? We are all righteously indignant when someone else holds in little esteem what we know to be precious. Extreme delight in someone or something naturally leads to extreme disgust when others consider that person or thing not worthy of their delight. No one who truly delights in God\u2019s word will be indifferent to the disregarding of it. Second, he desires it. I count at least six times where the psalmist expresses his longing to keep the commands of God (vv. 5, 10, 17, 20, 40, 131). I count at least fourteen times when he expresses a desire to know and understand the word of God (vv. 18, 19, 27, 29, 33, 34, 35, 64, 66, 73, 124, 125, 135, 169). It\u2019s true for all of us: our lives are animated by desire. It\u2019s what literally gets us up in the morning. Desire is what we dream about, what we pray about, and what we think about when we are free to think about whatever we want to think about. Most of us have strong desires related to marriage, children, grandchildren, jobs, promotions, houses, vacations, revenge, recognition, and on and on. Some desires are good; some are bad. But consider, in that jumble of longings and passions, how strong is your desire to know and to understand and to keep the word of God? The psalmist so desired the word of God that he considered suffering to be a blessing in his life if it helped him become more obedient to God\u2019s commands (vv. 67\u201368, 71). Third, he depends on it. The psalmist is constantly aware of his need for the word of God. \u201cI cling to your testimonies, O LORD; let me not be put to shame!\u201d (v. 31). He is desper\u00adate for the encouragement found in God\u2019s promise and rules (v. 50, 52). There are a lot of things we want in life, but there are few things we really need. The word of God is one of those things. In Amos\u2019s day the most severe punishment to fall on the people of God was a \u201cfamine \u2026 of hearing the words of the LORD\u201d (Amos 8:11). There is no calamity like the silence of God. We cannot know the truth or know ourselves or know God\u2019s ways or savingly know God himself unless God speaks to us. Every true Christian should feel deep in his bones an utter dependence on God\u2019s self-revelation in the Scriptures. Man does not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of the Lord (Deut. 8:3; Matt. 4:4). What we believe and feel about the word of God are ab\u00adsolutely crucial, if for no other reason than that they should mirror what we believe and feel about Jesus. As we\u2019ll see, Jesus believed unequivocally all that was written in the Scriptures. If we are to be his disciples, we should believe the same. Just as importantly, the New Testament teaches that Jesus is the word made flesh, which means (among other things) that all the attributes of God\u2019s verbal revelation (truth, righteousness, power, veracity, wisdom, omniscience) will be found in the person of Christ. All that the psalmist believed and felt about the words from God is all that we should feel and believe about the Word of God incarnate. Our desire, delight, and dependence on the words of Scripture do not grow inversely to our desire, delight, and dependence on Jesus Christ. The two must always rise together. The most mature Christians thrill to hear every love poem that speaks about the Word made flesh and every love poem that cel\u00adebrates the words of God. What Should I Do with the Word of God? The goal of this book is to get us believing what we should about the Bible, feeling what we should about the Bible, and to get us doing what we ought to do with the Bible. Given all that we\u2019ve seen about the psalmist\u2019s faith in the word and passion for the word, it\u2019s no surprise that Psalm 119 is filled with action verbs illustrating the Spirit-prompted uses for the word:\n\nwe sing the word (v. 172)\n\nspeak the word (vv. 13, 46, 79)\n\nstudy the word (vv. 15, 48, 97, 148)\n\nstore up the word (vv. 11, 93, 141)\n\nobey the word (vv. 8, 44, 57, 129, 145, 146, 167, 168)\n\npraise God for the word (vv. 7, 62, 164, 171)\n\nand pray that God would act according to his word (vv. 58, 121\u2013123, 147, 149\u2013152, 153\u2013160) These actions are no substitute for proper faith and af\u00adfection, but they are the best indicators of what we really believe and feel about the word. Sing, speak, study, store up, obey, praise, and pray\u2014this is how men and women of God handle the Scriptures. Now don\u2019t panic if you seem to fall short in believing, feeling, and doing. Remember, Psalm 119 is a love poem, not a checklist. The reason for starting with Psalm 119 is that this is where we want to end. This is the spiritual reaction the Spirit should produce in us when we fully grasp all that the Bible teaches about itself. My hope and prayer is that in some small way the rest of this book will help you say \u201cYes!\u201d to what the psalmist believes, \u201cYes!\u201d to what he feels, and \u201cYes!\u201d to everything he does with God\u2019s holy and precious word. A Few Final Clarifications Before diving into the rest of the book, it might be helpful to know what type of book you are reading. While I hope this volume will motivate you to read the Bible, this is not a book on personal Bible study or principles for interpreta\u00adtion. Nor do I attempt an apologetic defense of Scripture, though I hope you will trust the Bible more for having read these eight chapters. This is not an exhaustive book, cov\u00adering all the philosophical, theological, and methodological territory you might see in a fat, multivolume textbook. This is not an academic book with lots of footnotes. This is not a \u201ctake down\u201d book where I name names and cite \u201cchapter and verse\u201d for current errors. This is not a groundbreaking work in exegetical, biblical, historical, or systematic theology. \u201cSo what is this book?\u201d you ask yourself, wondering how you managed to pick up such a know-nothing volume. This is a book unpacking what the Bible says about the Bible. My aim is to be simple, uncluttered, straightforward, and manifestly biblical. I make no pretenses about offering you anything other than a doctrine of Scripture derived from Scripture itself. I know this raises questions about canon (how do you know you have the right Scriptures in the first place?) and questions about circular reasoning (how can you reference the Bible to determine the authority of the Bible?). These are reasonable questions, but they need not hold us up here. Both questions have to do with first principles, and a certain form of circularity is unavoidable whenever we try to defend our first principles. You can\u2019t establish the supreme authority of your supreme authority by going to some other lesser authority. Yes, the logic is circular, but no more so than the secularist defending reason by reason or the scien\u00adtist touting the authority of science based on science. This doesn\u2019t mean Christians can be irrational and unreasonable in their views, but it does mean our first principle is neither rationality nor reason. We go the Bible to learn about the Bible because to judge the Bible by any other standard would be to make the Bible less than what it claims to be. As J. I. Packer wrote more than fifty years ago when facing similar challenges, \u201cScripture itself is alone competent to judge our doctrine of Scripture.\u201d[2] There are many good books, some accessible and some technical, that thoughtfully explain and defend the canon of Scripture and the reliability of Scripture. I\u2019ve listed several of them in the appendix. If you have doubts about how the books of the Bible proved to be self-authenticating, or doubts about the historical accuracy of the Bible, or doubts about the ancient biblical manuscripts, by all means study the is\u00adsues for yourself. The claims of orthodox Christianity have no reason to avoid hard evidence and nothing to fear from a detailed examination of the facts. But my conviction, born out of experience and derived from the teaching of Scripture itself, is that the most effec\u00adtive means for bolstering our confidence in the Bible is to spend time in the Bible. The Holy Spirit is committed to working through the word. God promises to bless the reading and teaching of his word. The sheep will hear their Master\u2019s voice speaking to them in the word (cf. John 10:27). In other words, the word of God is more than enough to accomplish the work of God in the people of God. There is no better way to understand and come to embrace a biblical doctrine of Scripture than to open the cage and let Scripture out.\n\nIf you\u2019ve read this far, you probably have some interest in knowing the Bible better. You probably have some background in the Bible or have been directed here by someone who does. You may come with skepticism or full of faith, with ignorance needing to be remedied or with knowledge eager to be sharpened. Whatever the case, I trust, now that you know what kind of book this is, you\u2019ll be better prepared to benefit from it. And if you benefit from anything in these pages, it will be not because I\u2019ve done anything wonderful, but because it is life-changing to come face-to-face with the world\u2019s most wonderful book. May God give us ears, for we all need to hear the word of God more than God needs any of us to defend it. Excerpt from Taking God at His Word. \u00a9 2014 by Kevin DeYoung. Published by Crossway.
