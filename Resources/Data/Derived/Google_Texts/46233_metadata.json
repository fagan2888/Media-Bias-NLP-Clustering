Al Franken and GOP challenger Mike McFadden raised their voices and the temperature of their race Sunday, facing off in a spirited televised debate.\n\nMuch of the debate was punctuated by the candidates interrupting each other as they wrestled to answer questions on some of the most complex issues of the day: how to handle Islamic extremists, how to fix the Affordable Care Act and whether the United States should enact a travel ban from West Africa because of the Ebola virus.\n\nFranken attempted to paint McFadden, a Sunfish Lake businessman, as inexperienced and unprepared to handle the rigors and quick decisions that face a U.S. senator. McFadden assailed Franken for his 97 percent voting record with President Obama, saying the first-term senator is part of the partisan problem in Washington.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t be a rubber stamp for any president,\u201d McFadden said. \u201cIt\u2019s an issue because I think this president is leading in the wrong direction \u2026 I haven\u2019t met anyone who agrees with another person 97 percent of the time.\u201d\n\nFranken said the bulk of the votes cited were nominations and other smaller matters and that he votes \u201cfor Minnesota.\u201d\n\nThe two, sitting at a desk facing WCCO-TV moderators, had several volleys before Franken warmed up to full-throated attacks on McFadden. Franken called him out for what the incumbent termed inadequate answers to foreign policy questions and slammed McFadden\u2019s business background, calling him responsible for layoffs and so-called inversions, which allow companies to move operations overseas.\n\nGOP challenger Mike McFadden, right, shook hands with Sen. Al Franken\u2019s wife, Franni Bryson, after the debate Sunday.\n\n\u201cThis is a job where you have to answer questions in real time,\u201d Franken said. \u201cYou can\u2019t take cheap shots from the bleachers.\u201d\n\nOn fighting Islamic extremists, McFadden said he was disappointed in Obama\u2019s \u201cleading from behind\u201d on the issue. He called Franken\u2019s letter sent earlier this year to the U.S. Department of Justice asking for additional support to combat terror recruiting efforts in Minnesota a \u201cmeager, meager effort.\u201d\n\nFranken called the ISIL terror group \u201cbarbaric\u201d and said he supported a limited bombing campaign in Syria and Iraq to fight ISIL. He said he has been in touch with the FBI since 2009 on the recruitment of young people from Minnesota by terror groups in Somalia and the Middle East.\n\nHe said McFadden didn\u2019t talk about foreign policy for the first 10 months of his campaign.\n\n\u201cThere wasn\u2019t anything from you,\u201d Franken said, looking McFadden in the eye. \u201cIn the first 10 months of his campaign there was not a word about foreign policy, about terrorism, about public health \u2026 He ducked. And the reason why he ducked was because it is a difficult political decision.\u201d\n\nOn Ebola, Franken struggled to say whether he supported a travel ban, finally saying after being pressed three times that he had \u201cnothing against it\u201d but that he believed it would be insufficient because the majority of travelers from West Africa don\u2019t fly directly to the United States. McFadden said he supports a temporary travel ban, which many international experts call ineffective.\n\nWhen asked whether he was satisfied with Obama\u2019s handling of Ebola, Franken said, \u201cNo, and I don\u2019t think he is either.\u201d\n\nOn Obamacare, Franken acknowledged problems with the implementation but said 95 percent of Minnesotans now have health insurance, thanks to the law. He called McFadden\u2019s idea to scrap the plan and put states in charge impractical.\n\nMcFadden said states are \u201claboratories for experiments\u201d and that they \u2014 not the federal government \u2014 should decide whether to implement an individual mandate.\n\nThe GOP candidate said Franken was lying about McFadden\u2019s company\u2019s involvement with the restructuring of Smurfit Stone, a Montana mill, which closed and laid off 417 workers in 2009.\n\nOnce Franken\u2019s campaign began running ads last week on Smurfit, McFadden\u2019s company, Lazard Middle Market, took the deal off its website.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a CEO and you don\u2019t take responsibility for what your company does, what are you going to do as a senator?\u201d Franken asked. \u201cAren\u2019t you embarrassed?\u201d\n\nMcFadden said his company had nothing to do with the Smurfit deal. A campaign spokesman said McFadden ran Lazard Middle Market, while the company responsible for the Smurfit layoffs was called Lazard Fr\u00e8res.\n\nIn remarks after the debate, McFadden said he is on a leave from the company and didn\u2019t know why details of the Smurfit deal were scrubbed from Lazard\u2019s website, right after Franken began running negative ads about it.\n\n\u201cI would encourage you to call Lazard tomorrow and ask them,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nMcFadden said he has tried to keep the tone positive during the campaign and was \u201cdisappointed\u201d that Franken had spent millions attacking his reputation.\n\n\u201cMinnesotans are so sick of these attacks,\u201d McFadden said.\n\nSunday\u2019s faceoff was the second of three debates in the campaign; Franken and McFadden meet again next Sunday in a radio debate.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "Differences on ISIL and Ebola led to raised voices and sharp exchanges in Sunday confrontation moderated by WCCO-TV.", "title": "Franken, McFadden trade attacks in Senate debate", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/franken-mcfadden-raise-temperature-of-their-race-in-debate/280461602/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/08+386327+1SENDEBATE102714.JPG?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/08+386327+1SENDEBATE102714.JPG?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "twitter": {"description": "Differences on ISIL and Ebola led to raised voices and sharp exchanges in Sunday confrontation moderated by WCCO-TV.", "title": "Franken, McFadden trade attacks in Senate debate", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/franken-mcfadden-raise-temperature-of-their-race-in-debate/280461602/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/08+386327+1SENDEBATE102714.JPG?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/08+386327+1SENDEBATE102714.JPG?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "description": "Differences on ISIL and Ebola led to raised voices and sharp exchanges in Sunday confrontation moderated by WCCO-TV."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccffc\"", "article_summary": "Sunday\u2019s faceoff was the second of three debates in the campaign; Franken and McFadden meet again next Sunday in a radio debate.\nU.S. Sen.
