Her views place her even further outside the mainstream of the American electorate than President Barack Obama, who systematically dismantled U.S. immigration law during his two terms in office.\n\nBelow are just a few of the extreme immigration positions held by Clinton.\n\n(1) Expanding Unconstitutional Executive Amnesty\n\nPerhaps one of the most radical aspects Clinton\u2019s open borders platform is that she is openly campaigning on defending and even expanding President Obama\u2019s unconstitutional executive amnesties.\n\n\u201cYou can count on me to defend President Obama\u2019s executive actions on DACA and DAPA when I am president,\u201d Clinton said, referring to Obama\u2019s 2012 (DACA) and 2014 (DAPA) executive amnesties, which gave work permits and access to federal benefits to millions of illegal immigrants.\n\nClinton\u2019s campaign website states that, as President, she will \u201cdefend President Obama\u2019s executive actions to provide deportation relief for DREAMers and parents of Americans and lawful residents.\u201d Meaning, Clinton will allow millions of illegal immigrants to remain in the United States, receive work permits to legally fill American jobs, and get access to federal benefits paid for by U.S. taxpayers.\n\nIn addition, Clinton\u2019s website says she will \u201cextend those actions to additional persons with sympathetic cases if Congress refuses to act.\u201d\n\nIf Congress continues its refusal to act on comprehensive immigration reform, Hillary will put in place a simple, straightforward, accessible system for parents of DREAMers and others with a history of service and contribution to their communities to be able to make their case and be eligible for deferred action as well.\n\nHowever, as Sen. Jeff Sessions has pointed out, Congress has acted on so-called \u201ccomprehensive immigration reform\u201d and it has rejected it. Sessions explains that the reason any executive-ordered amnesty is unconstitutional is because \u201cthe President\u2019s action erases the laws Congress has passed in order to implement laws Congress has refused to pass.\u201d\n\nSessions said that \u201cCongress considered and rejected these changes to immigration law in 2006, 2007, 2010, 2013, and 2014.\u201d\n\nWhile Clinton is pushing for immigration policies that would expand migration rates, polls show that the American electorate overwhelming wants immigration levels to be frozen or reduced\u2014including 92% of the GOP electorate and 83% of the American electorate overall.\n\nMoreover, according to an October Rasmussen survey, most Americans still oppose Obama\u2019s unconstitutional executive amnesty. A Kellyanne Conway poll found that by a 2-1 margin, voters believe that illegal immigrants should be encouraged to return home by shutting off their access to U.S. jobs and welfare.\n\n(2) Amnesty Within 100 Days\n\nClinton has pledged to enact amnesty within her first 100 days in office. As NBC recently reported: \u201cIf elected, the former secretary of state has promised to build on President Obama\u2019s executive actions and introduce comprehensive immigration reform during her first 100 days in office.\u201d\n\nClinton\u2019s website has explained that by \u201ccomprehensive immigration reform,\u201d Clinton means full citizenship for illegal immigrants, which would give them welfare access, voting privileges, and the ability to bring over their family members through chain migration.\n\n\u201cAs president, Hillary will fight for comprehensive immigration reform that provides a full and equal path to citizenship,\u201d Clinton\u2019s website states.\n\nFull amnesty for the illegal immigrant population will cost U.S. taxpayers $6.3 trillion, according to a report from the Heritage Foundation.\n\nClinton\u2019s pledge for amnesty perhaps explains why she won the endorsement of open borders advocate Luis Gutierrez\u2013who has previously said \u201cI have only one loyalty\u2026 and that\u2019s to the immigrant community.\u201d\n\nIn return, Clinton has heaped praise on Gutierrez, declaring that \u201cfew people have done as much as Luis to make sure that when it comes to America\u2019s policies on immigration, those policies reflect America\u2019s values. He organizes, strategizes, preaches, teaches, inspires, cajoles, whatever it takes to keep this movement moving forward.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, Paul Ryan also won the early endorsement of Gutierrez prior to being elected as House Speaker. As Bretibart News has previously reported, Ryan\u2019s views on foreign migration, foreign trade, and foreign wars are more similar to Hillary Clinton\u2019s views than those of GOP presumptive nominee Donald Trump.\n\n(3) Freezing deportations\n\nClinton has said that, as President, that she will essentially freeze deportations.\n\n\u201cI would not deport children. I do not want to deport family members either,\u201d Clinton declared in March. Clinton\u2019s pledge not to enforce U.S. immigration law as President represents an essentially unprecedented departure from the nation\u2019s history of enforcing immigration law.\n\nThe Center for Immigration Studies\u2019 Mark Krikorian described Clinton\u2019s pledge as \u201ca breathtaking step toward open borders.\u201d\n\nAs the Washington Post reported: \u201cClinton\u2019s pledge not to deport any illegal immigrants except violent criminals and terrorists represents a major break from President Obama, and it could vastly increase the number of people who would be allowed to stay in the country.\u201d\n\nClinton\u2019s vision erases entirely the protections that U.S. immigration laws are supposed to afford American citizens: such as protecting Americans from losing a job to an illegal immigrant, preventing the sapping of school and hospital resources, as well as defending the voting privileges and enfranchisement of U.S. citizens (giving citizenship to illegal immigrants allows them to cancel out the votes of native-born American citizens).\n\nThe implication of Clinton\u2019s platform\u2013 i.e. that illegal entry is not in and of itself a deportable offense\u2013represents a central pillar of the open borders credo: namely, that millions of people can illegally come to the country, take jobs, attend U.S. schools, receive affirmative action, apply for federal benefits, and give birth to children who receive birthright citizenship.\n\nMoreover, waiting until after a violent conviction has been obtained to deport an illegal alien means that immigration laws were enforced far too late\u2013i.e. they were not enforced until after an American was victimized, raped, or murdered by a criminal alien. A federal policy that waits to enforce immigration laws until after there is a criminal conviction would mean admitting and releasing criminals by the hundreds of thousands, and letting them roam free until after they have committed a crime, and have been apprehended, tried, and convicted for that crime.\n\nAs Sen. Sessions has explained, immigration laws ought to remove criminal aliens before they are convicted of a violent crime. \u201cOur goal should be to keep 100% of dangerous aliens out of the United States\u2026 we need to remove potentially violent offenders before they hurt innocent families\u2014before the irreversible occurs.\u201d\n\n(4) There\u2019s no need to secure the border because it\u2019s already \u201cthe most secure border we\u2019ve ever had\u201d\n\nEven as tens of thousands of migrants continue to pour across our southern border, Clinton has declared that the border is \u201cthe most secure border we\u2019ve ever had\u201d\u2013 suggesting that she does not feel it is necessary to take additional actions to secure it. Clinton argues that since the border is already secure, it is time to give amnesty to the millions of migrants who have entered illegally.\n\n\u201cWe have the most secure border we\u2019ve ever had\u2026 The Republicans, the opponents, no longer have an argument,\u201d Clinton said during a March CNN/Univision Democratic debate. \u201cWe enhanced the border security. That part of the work is done\u2026 Everybody who I know who has looked at it says it is OK. We have a secure border. There\u2019s no need for this rhetoric and demagoguery that still is carried out on the Republican side. You\u2019ve run out of excuses. Let\u2019s move to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.\u201d\n\n(5) Closing Detention Centers\n\nOn her website, Clinton pledges to \u201cend family detention and close private immigrant detention centers\u201d.\n\n\u201cHillary believes we should end family detention for parents and children who arrive at our border in desperate situations. We have alternatives to detention for those who pose no flight or public safety risk, such as supervised release,\u201d Clinton\u2019s website explains.\n\nThis again represents a radical step in further dismantling what little immigration enforcement is now in place. Clinton is essentially saying that she will not detain new incoming illegal immigrants, but will instead release them into the interior of the United States.\n\n(6) Obamacare for illegal aliens\n\nClinton has repeatedly said that she supports giving Obamacare to illegal immigrants. Clinton\u2019s website says that Clinton wants to \u201cExpand access to affordable health care to all families\u2026 She believes we should let families\u2014regardless of immigration status\u2014buy into the Affordable Care Act exchanges.\u201d\n\nChelsea Clinton echoed this sentiment while campaigning for her mother. \u201cIt\u2019s so important to extend the Affordable Care Act to people who are living and working here, regardless of immigration status, regardless of citizenship status,\u201d Chelsea Clinton said in March.\n\n(7) Full path to citizenship\n\nClinton has pledged to use federal resources to ensure that millions of more foreign migrants are able to vote in U.S. elections:\n\nThere are millions of people in America who could be naturalized, but for one reason or another, they\u2019re not. So let\u2019s help more of our neighbors claim their rights. It\u2019s so powerful, so precious, to be a citizen of the United States! To be able to vote in our elections, to have a voice in our future, and I want to take down the barriers that are holding people back. So here\u2019s a few things I will do: I will work to expand fee waivers, so more people seeking naturalization can get a break on the costs. I will increase access to language programs to help people boost their English proficiency. I will enhance outreach and education so more people know their options and are engaged in the process. I don\u2019t want anyone who could be a citizen to miss out on that opportunity.\n\nPolling data suggests that Clinton\u2019s voter importation plan will overwhelmingly benefit the Democratic Party.\n\nA 2011 Pew survey found that Hispanics have a more negative view of capitalism (55%) than do supporters of Occupy Wall Street (47%). A 2012 Pew Hispanic Center survey found that 75% of Hispanics prefer bigger governments that provide more services as opposed to smaller governments that provide fewer services.\n\nPolitical scientists have documented how mass immigration helps Democratic politicians. As University of Maryland\u2019s James Gimpel noted: \u201cthe enormous flow of legal immigrants into the country \u2014 29.5 million 1980 to 2012 \u2014 has remade and continues to remake the nation\u2019s electorate in favor of the Democratic Party.\u201d\n\nReuters has similarly reported: \u201cImmigrants favor Democratic candidates and liberal policies by a wide margin, surveys show, and they have moved formerly competitive states like Illinois firmly into the Democratic column and could turn Republican strongholds like Georgia and Texas into battlegrounds in the years to come.\u201d\n\n(8) Expanded refugee resettlement\n\nHillary Clinton has called for a massive expansion in Middle East migration.\n\nAs Donald Trump has observed, \u201cCrooked Hillary wants a radical 500% increase in Syrian refugees.\u201d\n\nIndeed, last year Clinton called for admitting 65,000 Syrian refugees\u2014on top of the roughly 30,000 refugees and asylees the U.S. already admits from the Middle East each year. Adding in refugees from across the Muslim world, this means that under Clinton\u2019s plan, the U.S. would admit at least 105,000 thousand refugees from the Muslim world annually.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll work to ensure that every single refugee who seeks asylum in the United States has a fair chance to tell his or her story, this is the least we can offer people fleeing persecution and devastation,\u201d Clinton said in December.\n\nAs Breitbart News has previously reported, below is a more detailed breakdown of Islamic migration that would occur in her first term under the minimum numbers she has put forward thus far:\n\n\u2013 374,000 refugees/asylees from the Middle East during her first term, based on DHS data.\n\n\u2013 420,000 refugees/asylees from the Muslim world during her first term.\n\n\u2013 560,000 permanent migrants from the Middle East during her first term.\n\n\u2013 730,000 permanent migrants from the Muslim world during her first term.\n\nAccording to a September 2015 Rasmussen survey, only 5% of likely voters said that they wanted the U.S. to admit more than 100,000 refugees from the Middle East.\n\nWomen oppose Clinton\u2019s plan to bring more than 100,000 refugees from the Middle East by a remarkable 21-to-1 margin, with 84 percent opposing and four percent supporting.\n\nDemocrat voters oppose Clinton\u2019s refugee plan by a 17-to-1 margin with 87 percent opposing and five percent supporting.\n\nMost remarkably, 85 percent of black voters oppose Clinton\u2019s refugee agenda with less than one percent of black voters supporting her plan.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Clinton Releases Plan to Dissolve U.S. Border Within 100 Days", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Clinton Releases Plan to Dissolve U.S. Border Within 100 Days", "title": "Clinton Releases Plan to Dissolve U.S. Border Within 100 Days - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/05/Open-Southern-Border-Hillary-Clinton-AP-Photos.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/05/25/clinton-releases-plan-dissolve-us-border-within-100-days/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Clinton Releases Plan to Dissolve U.S. Border Within 100 Days", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/05/Open-Southern-Border-Hillary-Clinton-AP-Photos.jpg", "title": "Clinton Releases Plan to Dissolve U.S. Border Within 100 Days - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "center for immigration studies, DACA, DAPA, Islamic immigration, obamacare, occupy wall street, Sen Sessions,2016 Presidential Race, Hillary Clinton, Immigration,Hillary Clinton, Immigration", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "Sen Sessions", "published_time": "2016-05-25T10:48:57-07:00", "categories": "Immigration,2016 Presidential Race,Hillary Clinton"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "That part of the work is done\u2026 Everybody who I know who has looked at it says it is OK.
