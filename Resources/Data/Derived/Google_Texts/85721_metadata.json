(Huron and U.S. Society for Augmentative and Alternative Communication v. Cobert, Director of U.S. Office of Personnel Management (C.A.F.C. No. 14-5042, 1/19/2016)).\n\nThe facts described here are taken from the court\u2019s decision dismissing the lawsuit.\n\nMost readers are aware that the Office of Personnel Management is in charge of the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program (FEHB). In this role, the agency contracts with many insurance companies on a year-to-year basis for plans to be served up to employees and retirees as part of the annual open season selection process.\n\nSince 2008 OPM has \u201cencouraged\u201d rather than required the plans to cover speech-generating devices under their durable medical equipment coverage for FEHB. In response to this encouragement, some policies cover the devices and some do not. Of those that provide coverage, it varies in amount.\n\nThe plaintiffs are a non-profit society with interest in such issues, and Mr. Huron, who is both a member of the Society and a spouse covered through his wife\u2019s FEHB insurance. Huron uses a speech-generating device that was previously covered by his private insurance. After switching to his wife\u2019s GEHA policy through the FEHB, Huron\u2019s $5000 device went kaput. However, GEHA provides no coverage for the device and Medicare reimburses only 80% of the cost for a new one.\n\nWithout going into the detailed legal analysis, essentially the court concluded there was no jurisdiction because Huron\u2019s \u201cinjury\u201d (no coverage for the device by GEHA) is not traceable to OPM\u2019s actions, but rather to Huron\u2019s decision to pick a plan that did not cover the device even though other FEHB plans did.\n\nWhile the plaintiffs raised an issue of more than passing interest to those who rely on these devices, they will not get their day in court. The lesson perhaps is when selecting coverage during the annual open season, be careful to do your due diligence if you rely on particular medical devices or procedures that not all plans may cover.\n\nHuron v.
