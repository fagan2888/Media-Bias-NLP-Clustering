Super Bowl IX, also at Tulane Stadium, had a kickoff temperature of 46 degrees, holds the number two spot.\n\nSo after all the scrutiny and concern over holding an outdoor Super Bowl in a cold weather setting, Super Bowl XLVIII will only go down as the third coldest ever played, barely beating out Super Bowl VIII in Houston, Tex., which had a kickoff temperature of 50 degrees.\n\nThe temperature is expected to drop steadily throughout the game, but not to uncomfortable levels. It appears the game will miss a snowstorm by just 12 hours, but no precipitation is expected. And winds remain calm and should not have an impact on passing or kicking throughout the game.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "nj-weather, super-bowl-2014, weather, news", "title": "Super Bowl 2014 weather: With 49 degree kickoff temperature, only the third coldest ever played", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "Super Bowl XLVIII turned out to be rather pleasant, weather-wise", "title": "Super Bowl 2014 weather: With 49 degree kickoff temperature, only the third coldest ever played", "url": "http://www.nj.com/weather-guy/index.ssf/2014/02/super_bowl_2014_weather_at_49_degrees_at_kickoff_only_the_third_coldest_ever_played.html", "image": "http://image.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/star-ledger/photo/2014/02/14203632-large.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Super Bowl XLVIII turned out to be rather pleasant, weather-wise", "creator": "@sstirling", "image": "http://image.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/star-ledger/photo/2014/02/14203632-large.jpg", "title": "Super Bowl 2014 weather: With 49 degree kickoff temperature, only the third coldest ever played", "site": "@njdotcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article_date_updated": "Sunday, February 02, 2014,  6:53 PM", "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/StephenDStirling"}, "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Sunday, February 02, 2014,  6:52 PM", "article_author": "Stephen Stirling | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com", "Description": "Super Bowl XLVIII turned out to be rather pleasant, weather-wise"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd919a\"", "article_summary": "Super Bowl VI, played at Tulane Stadium in New Orleans, still holds the title with a kickoff temperature of 39 degrees.\nSo after all the scrutiny and concern over holding an outdoor Super Bowl in a cold weather setting, Super Bowl XLVIII will only go down as the third coldest ever played, barely beating out Super Bowl VIII in Houston, Tex., which had a kickoff temperature of 50 degrees.\nSuper Bowl IX, also at Tulane Stadium, had a kickoff temperature of 46 degrees, holds the number two spot.\nWith a temperature reading of 49 degrees at kickoff, the first open-air cold-weather climate didn't actually turn out to the the coldest ever played.\nThe temperature is expected to drop steadily throughout the game, but not to uncomfortable levels."}
