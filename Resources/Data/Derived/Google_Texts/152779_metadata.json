They seemed to have no issues. They knew the two of us were a same-sex couple,\u201d Ms. White told Canada\u2019s CBC news. \u201cI referred some of my friends to them, just because I did get good customer service and they had good prices.\u201d\n\nSEE ALSO: Gay-rights advocates torpedo GoFundMe campaign for Christian-owned bakery\n\nA friend of the couple went in to the store to purchase a ring for his girlfriend and saw a poster that read \u201cThe sanctity of marriage is under attack. Let\u2019s keep marriage between a man and a woman,\u201d CBC reported May 16.\n\nThe friend took a photo of the poster and sent it to Ms. White, who said she had no idea about the poster until that point.\n\n\u201cIt was really upsetting. Really sad, because we already had money down on [the rings], and they\u2019re displaying how much they are against gays, and how they think marriage should be between a man and a woman,\u201d Ms. White said, CBC reported.\n\nThe couple went to the store the next day to ask about the sign and demanded a refund.\n\n\u201cThey just said that that\u2019s their beliefs, and they think they can put up whatever they want. I just said it was very disrespectful, it\u2019s very unprofessional and I wanted a refund,\u201d Ms. White said, CBC reported. \u201cI have no issues with them believing in what they believe in. I think everyone\u2019s entitled to their own opinion. But I don\u2019t think they should put their personal beliefs inside their business.\u201d\n\nToday\u2019s Jewellers co-owner Esau Jardon said he has been posting signs in his stores throughout the years and he has never before had a problem with a customer.\n\n\u201cIt seems to be a Canadian right to post what you believe,\u201d Mr. Jardon told CBC.\n\nMr. Jardon said that he and his family immigrated to Canada because of its rights and freedoms and said he won\u2019t apologize for his beliefs.\n\n\u201cI feel really bad that [Ms. White] feels that we would in any way try to hurt or discriminate against her, but we will not retract from what we believe. I cannot say, \u2018Well because you feel bad, I will stop believing what I believe,\u2019\u201d he said, CBC reported.\n\n\u201cWhen I walk on Church Street in Toronto, where I am right now, and I see [LGBT rainbow flags], and I see a lot of signs and a lot of things on public property, I don\u2019t have a problem with them. I accept it. I chose to come to Canada\u2026 and we accept the whole package\u2026 I don\u2019t discriminate against that, nor do I come and tell them to take them down. For the same reason, I ask to have the same respect in return, especially when it\u2019s in my own business,\u201d Mr. Jardon said.\n\nHe told The Telegram that while he believes in a traditional family, he does not believe same-sex marriage should be illegal, and said the sign has been misunderstood.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t even mention homosexuals or a specific group within that. It could talk about, for example, the sanctity of the traditional family. There are other forms of heterosexuals that are practicing that (my family doesn\u2019t) believe in, that we think the traditional form is the best way. For example, if people are cohabitating,\u201d Mr. Jardon said, the newspaper reported.\n\nMr. Jardon said he has received so many hate emails and bullying messages on social media that he has been forced to shut down the business\u2019 Facebook page.\n\nThe social media backlash prompted Mr. Jardon to give Ms. White and Ms. Renouf a refund for their rings, which were already finished and waiting to be picked up.\n\n\u201cWe understand now that these attacks have nothing to do with Nicole or Pam they have been really nice and just want their money back to go buy elsewhere so we are giving them their money back,\u201d Mr. Jardon told the newspaper.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Canadian jeweler is under fire for displaying posters in his store advocating traditional marriage, which has prompted one same-sex couple to ask for a refund of their custom-made engagement rings.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A Canadian jeweler is under fire for displaying posters in his store advocating traditional marriage, which has prompted one same-sex couple to ask for a refund of their custom-made engagement rings.", "title": "Canadian jeweler makes rings for gay wedding, still threatened for traditional marriage views", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/may/23/canadian-jeweler-makes-rings-for-gay-wedding-still/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/23/Women_wedding_AP.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/23/Women_wedding_AP.jpg", "description": "A Canadian jeweler is under fire for displaying posters in his store advocating traditional marriage, which has prompted one same-sex couple to ask for a refund of their custom-made engagement rings.", "card": "summary", "title": "Canadian jeweler makes rings for gay wedding, still threatened for tra"}, "Author": "Kellan Howell", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Nicole White, Pam Renouf, Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, Canada, Esau Jardon"}, "article_summary": "A Canadian jeweler displayed posters in his store advocating traditional marriage, which prompted one same-sex couple to ask for a refund of their custom-made engagement rings.\n\u201cIt seems to be a Canadian right to post what you believe,\u201d Mr. Jardon told CBC.\nThey knew the two of us were a same-sex couple,\u201d Ms. White told Canada\u2019s CBC news.\nI just said it was very disrespectful, it\u2019s very unprofessional and I wanted a refund,\u201d Ms. White said, CBC reported.\nThe social media backlash prompted Mr. Jardon to give Ms. White and Ms. Renouf a refund for their rings, which were already finished and waiting to be picked up."}
