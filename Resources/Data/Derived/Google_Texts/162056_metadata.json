However, the program worked so poorly that it led to a major backlog of food stamp distribution.\n\nThe faulty North Carolina program is just one example of the firm\u2019s problems laid out in a Washington Post report. In spite of its troubled past, the administration granted Accenture a contract worth around $90 million to fix the glitchy Obamacare website.\n\nAs the Post notes, the U.S. Postal Service Inspector General\u2019s Office warned the Post Office against using Accenture as recently as last June. The IG\u2019s office recommended the Post Office consider terminating its more than $200 million in contracts with Accenture.\n\n\u201cAccenture\u2019s involvement in several improper contracting practices creates an immediate risk of future fraud and abuse in Postal Service contracts,\u201d deputy assistant inspector general Michael Magalski wrote in a memo. \u201cThe supplier has demonstrated an absence of business ethics, a lack of transparency, and insufficient internal controls in its business dealings with the Postal Service.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, a 2007 report from the Interior Department\u2019s inspector general criticized Accenture\u2019s work on a computer system for the Minerals Management Service, the Post reports. The new computer system reportedly took 15 times as long as the one it replaced. Then-inspector general Earl Devaney told the Post he \u201ccould not understand why Accenture had not been thrown out the door. Millions of dollars, and they still hadn\u2019t gotten this up and running after all that time.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe Post tallied nearly 30 problematic Accenture projects from the past decade that included technical problems and cost overruns. The firm says it has worked on more than 1,000 successful government projects in just the past year.\n\n\u201cAccenture is known for taking on the most complex and \u00admission-critical assignments and getting the job done,\u2019\u2019 company spokesman Jim Mc\u00adAvoy told the newspaper. \u201cWe have long-term relationships with the world\u2019s leading companies and our clients value our capabilities and our track record, and the quality of our work has been recognized.\u201d\n\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) decided last month to tap Acccenture to fix HealthCare.gov when its contract with CGI, the company originally responsible for the site, expired. Accenture was already maintaining California\u2019s state-run Obamacare website, and it assisted in the development of Kentucky's state site.\n\nSome major portions of HealthCare.gov, such as the program to process appeals from consumers whose insurance applications were initially processed incorrectly, have yet to be built.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The consulting giant Accenture was awarded a $90 million contract to fix HealthCare.gov in spite of past performance issues", "og": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/firm-fixing-obamacare-website-has-history-of-problems/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/12/25/99749f49-4097-4e51-90ad-299f67032cf7/thumbnail/1200x630/619a8ecf14e0ed66e8715d926f9453b1/AP106902674308.jpg", "height": 630}, "type": "article", "description": "The consulting giant Accenture was awarded a $90 million contract to fix HealthCare.gov in spite of past performance issues", "title": "Firm fixing Obamacare website has history of problems"}, "twitter": {"description": "The consulting giant Accenture was awarded a $90 million contract to fix HealthCare.gov in spite of past performance issues", "title": "Firm fixing Obamacare website has history of problems", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "cbsnewsapp://news/firm-fixing-obamacare-website-has-history-of-problems/", "iphone": "cbsnewsapp://news/firm-fixing-obamacare-website-has-history-of-problems/", "googleplay": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/firm-fixing-obamacare-website-has-history-of-problems/"}, "country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "CBS News", "iphone": "CBS News", "googleplay": "CBS News"}, "id": {"ipad": 334256223, "iphone": 334256223, "googleplay": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}}, "creator": "@http://twitter.com/stephcondoncbs", "site": "@CBSPolitics", "image": "http://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/12/25/99749f49-4097-4e51-90ad-299f67032cf7/thumbnail/1200x630/619a8ecf14e0ed66e8715d926f9453b1/AP106902674308.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"web": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/firm-fixing-obamacare-website-has-history-of-problems/"}, "android": {"app_name": "CBS News", "package": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}, "ios": {"url": "cbsnewsapp://news/firm-fixing-obamacare-website-has-history-of-problems/", "app_name": "CBS News", "app_store_id": 334256223}}, "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"app_id": 1536620209892267}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CBSPolitics", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/Political-Hotsheet/"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Postal Service Inspector General\u2019s Office warned the Post Office against using Accenture as recently as last June.\nThe IG\u2019s office recommended the Post Office consider terminating its more than $200 million in contracts with Accenture.\nIn spite of its troubled past, the administration granted Accenture a contract worth around $90 million to fix the glitchy Obamacare website.\nAccenture was already maintaining California\u2019s state-run Obamacare website, and it assisted in the development of Kentucky's state site.\nThe faulty North Carolina program is just one example of the firm\u2019s problems laid out in a Washington Post report."}
