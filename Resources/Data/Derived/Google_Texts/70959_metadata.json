The price tag: $41 trillion over ten years.\n\nActually, the correct number may well be higher. Friedman claims that Sanders\u2019 plan would reduce national health-care spending (both public and private) by $6.3 trillion over ten years, through a combination of price controls and rationing. If these savings aren\u2019t realized, the cost will exceed $41 trillion.\n\nRoy questions whether $6.3 trillion will be saved:\n\nThe plan would make nearly all health-care services free to all U.S. residents, regardless of price or value. As anyone who has been to an open bar knows, when you make the apparent cost of a service \u201cfree,\u201d the nearly certain outcome is more consumption, not less. The only way to keep costs down under single-payer is to control access and price, as Canada has attempted to do. It\u2019s far from clear that American doctors, hospitals, nurses, et al. will accept the 15 percent pay cut needed to realize Friedman\u2019s savings.\n\nBut let\u2019s assume that Sanders\u2019 plan costs only $41 trillion over ten years. According to Roy, this translates into an increase of 55 percent in federal spending from 2017-2026.\n\nNo wonder Hillary Clinton prefers gradualism, i.e., \u201cbuilding\u201d on Obamacare, to a \u201ccontentious debate\u201d over completely socialized medicine and its huge price tag.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Power Line", "description": "Bernie Sanders has proposed \u201cMedicare for all Americans.\u201d It sounds sweet, but how much would it cost?
