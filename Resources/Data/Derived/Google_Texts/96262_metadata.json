The authors explain that evaluating the quality of a child\u2019s emotional health is based on analysing a range of internal factors in a person\u2019s early life, including whether they endured unhappiness, sleeplessness, eating disorders, bedwetting, fearfulness or tiredness.\n\nThe academics claim that their study, What Predicts a Successful Life? A Life-course Model of Well-being, published in the latest edition of the Economic Journal, offers \u201ca completely new perspective on which factors contribute most to a satisfying life\u201d. The study claims to challenge \u201cthe basic assumption of educational policy in recent years \u2013 that academic achievement matters more than anything else\u201d. This claim appears to be an implicit criticism of former education secretary Michael Gove, who instructed schools not to focus on \u201cperipheral\u201d issues such as children\u2019s moral, social and cultural development in favour of academic excellence. Gove\u2019s successor, Nicky Morgan, has pledged to reverse this approach.\n\nLayard and his team analysed data from about 9,000 people who were born over a three-week period in 1970 and then tracked by the British Cohort Survey, a study that asks them to complete an extensive questionnaire about their lives every five to seven years. They were also asked to rate their satisfaction at key periods through their lives. The team then examined factors including their income, educational achievement, employment, whether they had been in trouble with the law, whether they were single, as well as their physical and emotional health \u2013 to gauge how significant these were in determining satisfaction. In addition, a range of factors that affect a child\u2019s development \u2013 for example, intellectual performance, family socio-economic background and emotional health were also examined.\n\nMany people have assumed income is the most important factor in an adult\u2019s life satisfaction. But the academics say their data makes clear this is far less important than emotional health \u2013 both in a child and in an adult. \u201cIncome only explains about 1% of the variation in life satisfaction among people in the UK \u2013 one sixth of the fraction explained by emotional health,\u201d they note. Or, to put it another way, money really cannot buy you happiness.\n\nThe findings are controversial. As one of Layard\u2019s colleagues, Andew E Clark, notes in an accompanying paper, the suggestion that \u201ceducation and income are among the least important determinants of adult success, as measured by life satisfaction \u2026 risks provoking outrage among some.\u201d\n\nBut the economics of happiness or wellbeing is now a growing and respected discipline within economics that is starting to influence politicians.\n\nDavid Cameron has stated: \u201cIt\u2019s time we admitted that there\u2019s more to life than money and it\u2019s time we focused not just on GDP but on GWB \u2013 general well-being.\u201d\n\nThe findings raise questions about the extent to which intervening in a child\u2019s life will pay dividends later on.\n\n\u201cChild interventions can produce massive savings to public finances but these are often at a much later date,\u201d the authors note. They conclude: \u201cBy far the most important predictor of adult life-satisfaction is emotional health, both in childhood and subsequently. We find that the intellectual performance of a child is the least important childhood predictor of life-satisfaction as an adult.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#005689", "description": "LSE study says money, success and good grades are less important", "application-name": "The Guardian", "author": "Jamie Doward", "og": {"site_name": "the Guardian", "description": "LSE study says money, success and good grades are less important", "title": "Emotional health in childhood \u2018is the key to future happiness\u2019", "url": "http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/nov/08/happiness-childhood-emotional-health-richard-layard", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/8/1415463335821/fcc27b63-6718-438e-9627-cefc8390495f-2060x1236.jpeg?w=1200&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=8795f65833078bd78cc73ec2670f2e1f", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"app": {"url": {"ipad": "gnmguardian://society/2014/nov/08/happiness-childhood-emotional-health-richard-layard?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/nov/08/happiness-childhood-emotional-health-richard-layard", "iphone": "gnmguardian://society/2014/nov/08/happiness-childhood-emotional-health-richard-layard?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}, "id": {"ipad": 409128287, "iphone": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"ipad": "The Guardian", "googleplay": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}}, "image": "https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/8/1415463335821/fcc27b63-6718-438e-9627-cefc8390495f-2060x1236.jpeg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@guardian"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Guardian", "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://society/2014/nov/08/happiness-childhood-emotional-health-richard-layard?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "HandheldFriendly": "True", "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287}, "theme-color": "#005689", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/f06f6996e193d1ddcd614ea852322d25/windows_tile_144_b.png", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "Children,Education,Education policy,Politics,Society,Michael Gove,London School of Economics and Political Science,Happiness indices,Health & wellbeing,World news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "published_time": "2014-11-08T20:34:03.000Z", "author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jamiedoward", "section": "Society", "modified_time": "2016-05-07T10:32:54.000Z", "tag": "Children,Education,Education policy,Politics,Society,Michael Gove,London School of Economics and Political Science,Happiness indices,Health & wellbeing,World news"}, "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/8/1415463335821/fcc27b63-6718-438e-9627-cefc8390495f-2060x1236.jpeg?w=620&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=67950902b911c37ba54f26bf887da3e7", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Children,Education,Education policy,Politics,Society,Michael Gove,London School of Economics and Political Science,Happiness indices,Health & wellbeing,World news"}, "article_summary": "They conclude: \u201cBy far the most important predictor of adult life-satisfaction is emotional health, both in childhood and subsequently.\nBut the academics say their data makes clear this is far less important than emotional health \u2013 both in a child and in an adult.\n\u201cIncome only explains about 1% of the variation in life satisfaction among people in the UK \u2013 one sixth of the fraction explained by emotional health,\u201d they note.\nIn addition, a range of factors that affect a child\u2019s development \u2013 for example, intellectual performance, family socio-economic background and emotional health were also examined.\nWe find that the intellectual performance of a child is the least important childhood predictor of life-satisfaction as an adult.\u201d"}
