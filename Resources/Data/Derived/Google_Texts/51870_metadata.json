But some of these drivers have encountered the opposite \u2014 bumper-to-bumper traffic that some say is much worse than in the regular lanes.\n\nWith the warmer weather in recent weeks, the volume of traffic on I-95 has been steadily increasing. Friday afternoons are the busiest travel period on the interstate. To the dismay of late-week drivers in the Express Lanes, a long delay has formed over the past several Friday afternoons in Quantico. The backup leads to the southern end of the Express Lanes, where an elevated ramp deposits traffic into the main lanes of I-95 before the highway\u2019s interchange at Route 610.\n\nLast Friday, this queue was over seven miles long by midafternoon, beginning near Dumfries, Virginia. Some who drove the lanes said they waited for more than an hour in an exit-less stretch through the Quantico Marine Base just for an opportunity to escape. Most agreed that the drivers in the main lanes were making better time.\n\nOne driver put it this way: \u201cI feel ripped off.\u201d Liz commutes from Fredericksburg to Reston using the Express Lanes on I-95 and I-495 every day. She was quick to express her frustration as she inched through the recurring Friday afternoon traffic jam several weeks ago.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m paying the highest price right now, probably, because of the amount of volume \u2026 and I\u2019m going a fraction of the pace of the mainline. I bowl in a bowling league and I thought I\u2019d be home by seven o\u2019clock, but now I probably won\u2019t be home until eight at the earliest.\u201d\n\nMike McGurk, with TransUrban, the developer and operator of the 95 Express Lanes, says he is aware of the delay: \u201cIt\u2019s the Friday getaway traffic that\u2019s compounding it.\u201d\n\nTranUrban has attempted to moderate the backup in recent weeks.\n\n\u201cWe are using dynamic message signs to advise of congestion whenever that does occur. This is atypical of that area, but when it does happen, we are using those signs to advise folks that there\u2019s congestion ahead so they do have that in advance,\u201d McGurk says.\n\nOne of these signs has been placed before the last exit point in Dumfries. It offers drivers one last chance to get back into the main lanes before they commit to the final leg in Stafford County. Liz admits she\u2019s missed the exit a few times and has paid for it in money and time.\n\n\u201cThe exits from the [Express] Lanes are different from they used to be. Now that flyover for Quantico is in a different spot.\u201d\n\nIn addition to guidance from electronic signs, TransUrban will continue to tweak the cost of the lanes during peak times to dissuade drivers from using the lanes when the congestion develops.\n\n\u201cOver the longer term, I think what drivers might expect is to see the toll prices increase to continue in the lanes after that exit point,\u201d McGurk says.\n\nThe price for the lanes fluctuates depending on the volume of traffic. TransUrban relies on this form of congestion pricing to keep the traffic in the lanes moving, even during rush hours. This tactic works most of the time.\n\nStill crawling through Quantico, Liz wonders how much money her trip will ultimately cost.\n\n\u201cI think that paying for it is an ultra-bummer \u2026 I\u2019m watching my colleague drivers over there in the mainline \u2014 who opted not to pay \u2014 make better progress than I am.\u201d\n\nMcGurk and others at TransUrban have been fielding questions, complaints and compliments since the unveiling of the facility late last year.\n\n\u201cIf you have feedback, or you weren\u2019t satisfied with your trip, you can certainly contact our customer service center. We always want that feedback. The 95 Express Lanes are still so brand new that \u2026 it\u2019s going to help us provide a better option for people over the years ahead.\u201d\n\nAnyone with questions can call 1-855-495-9777 or visit https://www.expresslanes.com/contact.\n\nFollow @WTOP on Twitter and WTOP on Facebook.\n\n\u00a9 2015 WTOP.
