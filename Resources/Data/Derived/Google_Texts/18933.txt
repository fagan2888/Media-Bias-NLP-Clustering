Kansas State University has announced a $1 billion fundraising campaign.

The schools said in a news release that President Kirk Schulz unveiled the effort Friday before a crowd filled with hundreds of supporters. The goal is to grow the university's endowment, providing resources to improve student retention and graduation rates, train faculty and assist with new research efforts.

The school says that in the five year leading up to the public announcement, $766 million has been in invested in the university through the campaign.

Schulz thanked donors for their generosity, saying it's the "foundation" for the university's success. The university has set a goal of being among the top 50 public research universities by 2025. Schulz says the campaign is "another huge step forward."
