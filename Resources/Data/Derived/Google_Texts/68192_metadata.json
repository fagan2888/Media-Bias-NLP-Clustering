Christie when asked by reporters about his wife\u2019s \u201ceye roll,\u201d which he insisted was not, in fact, an eye roll. \u201cI\u2019ve seen the eye roll for 32 years. That was not an eye roll.\u201d (Christie dodged a question about how he felt about Trump\u2019s remark on Clinton playing the \u201cwoman card.\u201d)\n\nHAPPY BIRTHDAY: Rep.

Wigenton. Baldassare, representing former Port Authority of New York and New Jersey Deputy Executive Director Bill Baroni, grabbed a reporter's cell phone to emphasize that he wants physical possession of Gov. Chris Christie's phone to see if it contains evidence to help his case. Baldassare also said he wants the cell phones of former Christie Chief of Staff Regina Egea and spokesman Michael Drewniak, and the phones of any other Christie staffers that were turned over to Gibson Dunn.\u201d http://bit.ly/1N3Juel\n\nTHAT ENDLESS SKYWAY \u2014 \u201cPort Authority in talks with SEC about settling Pulaski inquiry,\u201d by POLITICO\u2019s Ryan Hutchins: \u201cThe Port Authority of New York and New Jersey is trying to reach a deal with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to end an investigation of statements the agency made in bond documents. A settlement with the financial regulator could mean the Port will avoid being sued over financial disclosures involving the $1.8 billion Pulaski Skyway project and other nearby infrastructure work. \u2018Discussions have been initiated between the Port Authority and the staff of the SEC regarding a potential resolution of the investigation,\u2019 the Port disclosed in a bond offering document released on Thursday.\u201d http://politi.co/1qZFGAv\n\nATLANTIC CITY \u2014 \u201cAtlantic City, America\u2019s worst-rated town, stares at default,\u201d by The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Timothy W. Martin and Heather Gillers: \u201cAtlantic City has so little money left that it could miss a $1.8 million bond payment due Sunday, a step that would make it the first New Jersey municipality to default on debt since the Great Depression. The Jersey Shore gambling destination has endured years of strain as a third of its casinos shut down. But now its cash levels are low enough that bankruptcy is a possibility for the 39,000-population city, according to Mayor Don Guardian. \u2018We\u2019re down to a couple million dollars on any given day,\u2019 the mayor said in an interview. Once prized as a vacation destination because of its giant casinos and boardwalk, Atlantic City is in this position because of a declining economy and mounting debt. Its predicament is more severe than most distressed U.S. municipalities because it has the worst credit rating of any American city.\u201d http://on.wsj.com/1WWJ6Aj\n\nWHERE\u2019S THEIR CUT? \u2014 \"Port Authority officials take issue with Newark\u2019s $10M Uber deal,\" by POLITICO's Dana Rubinstein: \u201cThe chairman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey doesn't approve of a recent deal Newark Mayor Ras Baraka hammered out with Uber. Following Thursday's Port Authority board meeting, chairman John Degnan said he doesn't think Newark has the right to \u2018charge for the ability to use Uber or Lyft or other ride-sharing companies at Newark Airport.\u2019 ... Degnan made his remarks the day after Baraka unveiled more details about his city's agreement to allow Uber drivers access to Terminals B and C at Newark airport, which sits on land the Port Authority leases from the city. Under the terms of Baraka's deal with the San Francisco-based car-hail giant, Uber agreed to pay Newark $10 million over ten years to access airport customers. \u2026 \u2018I think our position is that the laws of New York and New Jersey, as well as the lease between the Port Authority and the city of Newark, don\u2019t permit that,\u2019 said the Port's executive director, Pat Foye. It's not clear what happens next.\u201d http://politi.co/1STXU32\n\n\u2014Today is Rob Duffey\u2019s last day as policy and communications director for New Jersey Working Families. Duffey is moving to Berlin\u2026. I mean BerlinRosen Public Affairs, to be part of the firm\u2019s new national labor & economy team.\n\nTTF \u2014 \"Could Democrats cut a deal on state tax deduction for charitable contributions,\" by NJ Spotlight's John Reitmeyer: \u201cRepublican lawmakers have tried in vain for roughly a decade to convince Democrats who control the state Legislature to create a new tax break for New Jersey residents who make charitable contributions. But this year Democrats in the Senate are taking a second look at the issue, offering new hope to the GOP sponsors who want to see New Jersey added to the list of states that permit charitable donations to be deducted from state income taxes just as they can deduct contributions from federal taxes. Whether the tax break can make it out of the Legislature this year is still unclear. It will depend largely on how talks progress over the next few weeks on a series of proposed tax-policy changes, including an increase of the state gas tax that Democrats are seeking to bring in more money for New Jersey\u2019s going-broke Transportation Trust Fund.\u201d http://bit.ly/1WWKO4T\n\n\u2014In a screed against Christie over gun control, a Huffington Post blogger offers one potential news nugget, saying Democrats in New Jersey plan yet another gun control push this spring. No details on that. http://huff.to/1WWL4Ro\n\nIF ONLY THERE WAS A PROJECT ALREADY UNDERWAY \u2014 \u201cFeds to hold North Jersey hearing on Gateway tunnel project,\u201d by The Record\u2019s Christopher Maag: \u201cThe Federal Railroad Administration will hold its first public hearings in May on the long-stalled Gateway project to dig a new train tunnel under the Hudson River. The hearings are intended to get public comment about the scope of the project\u2019s environmental review, a necessary first step that is required for the tunnel to gain federal approval for construction to begin. The review will be conducted by the rail administration and NJ Transit. Anthony Foxx, the U.S. Secretary of Transportation, has added to speed up the review process so that construction can begin as soon as possible.A new tunnel must be built before the existing one fails, which could happen any time in the next 19 years, say officials at Amtrak, which owns the tunnel.\u201d http://bit.ly/1N3I2sv\n\nTHE CHRONICLES OF OMNIA \u2014 \u201cWill Horizon penalize N.J. doctors for not telling patients about new health plans?\u201d by NJ Advance Media\u2019s Susan K. Livio: \u201cNew Jersey's oldest physician organization has lashed out against Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey, the state's largest health insurance company, for requiring doctors to explain how patients enrolled in discount plans can save more money by using a preferred network of doctors. If doctors don't discuss \u2018the cost sharing implications\u2019 of using \u2018Tier 1 or 2\u2019 doctors and hospitals with their patients who are enrolled in Horizon's OMNIA plans, they\u2019 \u2018may be subject to consequences, up to and including termination from Horizon BCBSNJ's networks\u2019 according to a newsletter Horizon sent doctors last month.\u201d http://bit.ly/1VWQiwX\n\nLIKE RICE ON WHITE HAIR \u2014 \u201cRice says Norcross is \u2018less than a man\u2019\u2019 by PolitickerNJ\u2019s Max Pizarro: \u201cRoyally irritated state Senator Ronald L. Rice (D-28) today chastised South Jersey power broker George Norcross III for intruding into Statehouse politics, upbraiding the boss for buttonholing Bergen leadership to discuss taking out Speaker Vincent Prieto (D-32) \u2026 \u2018I have a real problem with George,\u2019 the Newark senator told PolitickerNJ. \u2018The last time he said hello to me I let him know how I feel, and I intend to tell him again the next time I see him. \u2018George, you\u2019re a very wealthy guy, but you\u2019re not going to use your influence to push people around.\u201d http://bit.ly/1N3IuHc\n\nOBAMACARE \u2014 \u201cCould N.J. lose one of its Obamacare insurers?\u201d by NJ Advance Media\u2019s Kathleen O\u2019Brien: \u201cInsurance giant UnitedHealthcare roiled the political landscape recently when it revealed it will stop selling policies through the federal government website in all but \"a handful\" of states. Such policies - in most cases heavily subsided - are a cornerstone of the Affordable Care Act, now in its third full year. UnitedHealthCare has declined to say whether it will remain in New Jersey's ACA marketplace, where it operates under the name of a subsidiary, Oxford Health. State insurance regulators in 26 other states have stated they've been notified by United that it will be pulling out of their marketplaces in 2017. Officials in New York, Nevada and Virginia say the company will be staying in their states. The N.J. Department of Banking and Insurance has not responded to inquiries about United's intentions.\u201d http://bit.ly/1T81hgs\n\nSHOCKED - SHOCKED! \u2014 \u201cCops 'shocked' over officer's racial slurs in 'nanny-cam' video,\u201d by NJ Advance Media\u2019s Bill Wichert: \u201cOn the morning of June 21, 2013, Millburn Detectives Collin McMillan and Andrew DelRusso and other township police officers responded to a residence where an African-American man had attacked a woman during a home invasion and fled the scene. A \u2018nanny-cam\u2019 video in the house captured McMillan using racial slurs about the assailant on three occasions. While speaking with DelRusso at one point, McMillan referred to the attacker as a \u2018monkey\u2019 and said the case would take precedence over his other cases. DelRusso then replied, \u2018Yup.\u2019 \u2026 DelRusso said he first heard the slur when he recently viewed the video, saying the remark was \u2018completely shocking.\u2019\u201d http://bit.ly/1T8229j\n\nYOU WON\u2019T BELIEVE WHAT WEEDMAN WAS ARRESTED FOR \u2014 \u201c'NJ Weedman' facing pot charges, 9 others arrested at Joint,\u201d by Keith Brown for NJ.com: \u201cEd \u2018NJ Weedman\u2019 Forchion \u2026 who opened the restaurant and sanctuary last year, faces 10 charges of marijuana possession and distribution, as well as distribution of drug paraphernalia, maintaining a narcotics nuisance, and for having booby traps in a manufacturing or distribution facility.\u201d http://bit.ly/1T82oN7\n\n\u2014How the man in charge of Medicare plans to win back doctors' hearts and minds.

But two South Jersey sources contend that Stellato floated the name of Assemblyman Gary Schaer (D-36) as a possible Prieto replacement.\u201d http://bit.ly/1T86Z27\n\n\u2014New Jersey is the third most similar state to the rest of the country, trailing only Illionois and New York, according to 538.

The representative, Tom MacArthur, shared new revelations from whistle-blowers that the agency\u2019s process to re-examine insurance claims from the devastating storm \u2014 after allegations of fraud arose last year \u2014 had itself been plagued by fraud. Representative MacArthur, a Republican serving the Third Congressional District, said he had been provided three affidavits outlining accusations of impropriety from several whistle-blowers who had worked on a review process set up by FEMA last year to take a renewed look at flood insurance claims after revelations that engineers assessing damage had altered their reports. \u2018I have seen doctored engineering reports with my own eyes,\u2019 he said.\u201d http://nyti.ms/1WWLp6v\n\n\u2014\u201cCongressional candidates in S.J. argue over political ties\u201d http://bit.ly/1WWLA1G\n\nENERGY \u2014 \"Amid state\u2019s refusal to comply, groups chart a path toward Clean Power Plan,\" by POLITICO's David Giambusso: \u201cDespite assurances from the Christie administration that it has no intention of complying with the federal Clean Power Plan, the state-appointed Clean Air Council nonetheless spent Thursday hearing from industry and advocacy experts on how best to comply with the emissions regulations. Created in 1954, the council, whose members are largely appointed by the governor, advises the state Department of Environmental Protection on air pollution-related issues. Even though Gov. Chris Christie insists New Jersey will not comply with the plan, the state will be forced to adhere to it if the regulation is upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court, where it remains in a state of limbo.\u201d http://politi.co/1XXywr3\n\nEVERYONE\u2019S FAVORITE BISTATE AGENCY \u2014 \u201cPort Authority leaders blame N.J. lawmakers for delay in reforms; call Uber-Newark deal illegal,\u201d by The Record\u2019s Christopher Maag: \u201cThe agency\u2019s leaders were especially critical of Democratic lawmakers in New Jersey, who have refused to pass long-stalled legislation to reform the Port Authority in the wake of the George Washington Bride lane closure scandal. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo already has signed a law overhauling the agency\u2019s leadership structure. But the Democrats who control the New Jersey legislature have refused to pass the same law, primarily because it includes no language forcing Port Authority leaders to appear for hearings \u2026 As a bi-state agency, the Port Authority needs identical legislation in both states before the reforms can become binding. John Degnan, the port\u2019s chairman and a Christie appointee, accused the Democrats of holding up important changes for trivial reasons. \u2018I think it\u2019s gilding the lily to hold up the entire reform for that minor provision,\u2019 said Port Authority Chairman John Degnan, who was appointed by Gov. Christie, a Republican.\u201d http://bit.ly/1qZFHUT\n\nSTATE TO MANDATE THEY\u2019RE ALL MADE OUT OF TICKY-TACKY \u2014 \u201cTiny house trend hits the statehouse,\u201d by POLITICO\u2019s Matt Friedman: \u201cNew Jersey legislators are getting in on the tiny-house trend, with two bills that would have the state assist in the building of tiny homes for the homeless or to combat climate change. State Sen. Raymond Lesniak on Monday introduced legislation (S2110) that would direct the state to seek charitable or federal grants for a \u201cTiny Home Pilot Program\u201d in three parts of the state. Lesniak, a Democrat from Union County, first introduced the bill in December 2014, attracting a substantial amount of media attention. But in that version, the state would have provided $5 million to jump-start the program. \u201cBut the state doesn\u2019t have the money for that, so we\u2019re directing the HMFA [New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency] to seek private funding or federal grants to see if that could boost the development of these homes that would be affordable for many types of people who can\u2019t afford any type of housing in New Jersey,\u201d Lesniak said. Assemblywoman Pamela Lampitt in January introduced legislation (A1471) modeled on Lesniak\u2019s, but with the aim of combating climate change instead of poverty. Lampitt\u2019s bill would appropriate the $5 million from the general fund.\u201d http://politi.co/1T88a1k\n\nSCUTARI \u2014 \u201cLinden court held hearings without prosecutor, defense attorney, lawsuit claims,\u201d by NJ Advance Media\u2019s Tom Haydon: \u201cDuring the litigation over [former municipal court judge Louis] DiLeo's lawsuit, an email from then Linden court administrator Elizabeth Gavigan to the mayor said that then municipal prosecutor, state Senator Nicholas Scutari (D-Union), routinely left court before the docket was completed. Scutari denies leaving court sessions early. \u2018I always completely finished the prosecutor's duties before I left,\u2019 Scutari said. \u2018We never left until our duties were over.\u2019\u201d http://bit.ly/1WWJoHt\n\nWHY ARE THEY IGNORING THE URGENT NEED FOR FLIGHTS TO COLUMBIA, SC? \u2014 \u201cJetBlue adding more flights from Newark to Florida after airport change,\u201d by NJ Advance Media\u2019s Craig McCarthy: \u201cJetBlue is the first airline to take advantage of Newark airport's new federal reclassification, announcing Thursday it will add six more flights a day from the Garden State to the Sunshine State. Starting in the fall, the airline said it will increase its daily roundtrip options to Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, Orlando International Airport, Tampa International Airport, Palm Beach International Airport and Fort Myers' Southwest Florida International Airport.\u201d http://bit.ly/1T82Zyv\n\nA LITTLE LATE FOR THAT \u2014 \u201cCounty executive calls for audit of nonprofit amid corruption probe,\u201d by Cristina Rojas for NJ.com: \u201dMercer County Executive Brian Hughes is calling for an audit into The Friends of Mercer County Park, addressing for the first time on Thursday the state attorney general's investigation into the nonprofit. \u2018I will ensure the Mercer County Park Commission and all entities related to our park system uphold the ethical standards that are hallmarks of my administration and that are expected by the taxpayers of this great county,\u2019 he said.\u201d http://bit.ly/1WWJK0E\n\nHIGHLAND PARK \u2014 \u201cN.J. school district seeks to lead in transgender equality,\u201d by NJ Advance Media\u2019s Spencer Kent: \u201cThe borough has never been afraid to take a stand for progressive values, even if it meant making a little noise, said Darcie Cimarusti, president of the Highland Park Board of Education. Which is why Cimarusti and other officials and experts were not afraid to say that the state has not gone nearly far enough in addressing transgender and gender diverse equality with statewide policy.\u201d http://bit.ly/1T81sIR\n\nALL OUR BASES STILL BELONG TO US \u2014 \u201cArmed Services Committee approves defense bill without base closures,\u201d by The Burlington County Times\u2019 David Levinsky: \u201cLawmakers in Congress approved a $610 billion defense policy bill early Thursday that would once again block the Pentagon from moving forward with its request to begin preparations for a new round of base closures \u2026 New Jersey Reps.

The flames pose a threat, particularly as development as crept up to the woods, but they're also an integral part of the Pinelands' natural ecosystem process.

It is illegal to intentionally feed black bears in New Jersey and punishable by a fine of up to $1,000.

This year\u2019s case featured the Ministry of Magic v. Harry Potter, with the young wizard on trial for the murder of his longtime arch nemesis, Lord Voldemort. Potter contended that the killing was a matter of self-defense during the two wizards\u2019 final duel. The ministry argued that it was always Potter\u2019s intent to kill Voldemort and that he should not have taken matters into his own hands, but rather let Voldemort be captured and have justice be done for his prior bad acts.\u201d http://bit.ly/1SUhRXg\n\nMORE NEWS\n\n\u2014\u201cChristie sending all motor vehicle employees to customer service training\u201d http://bit.ly/1qZFalV\n\n\u2014\"Federal agency gives approval for new nuclear reactor in Salem County\u201d http://politi.co/1rm1NBr\n\n\u2014\u201cState could force 5 more towns to reassess properties\u201d http://bit.ly/1WWIURA\n\n\u2014 \"With 12 days until Atlantic City coffers run dry, Christie pushes Prieto\u201d http://politi.co/1STXABm\n\n\u2014\u201cBergen County Executive James Tedesco unveils $545M budget\u201d http://bit.ly/1N3K7o9\n\n\u2014\u201cBattle pits union against union in Jersey City\u201d http://bit.ly/1N3HJOa\n\n\u2014\u201cN.J. university adding new nursing school amid spike in demand\u201d http://bit.ly/1T82JPW\n\n-Want to make an impact?
