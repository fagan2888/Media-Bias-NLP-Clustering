Wendy Davis would consider using \u201cexecutive action\u201d to expand the state's Medicaid program under the Affordable Care Act in the face of likely opposition from a Republican-dominated state Legislature, she said Saturday in a wide-ranging interview at The Texas Tribune Festival.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s some indication that an executive action can achieve this,\u201d Davis told Tribune CEO and Editor-in-Chief Evan Smith. \u201cSometimes you have to do hard things when they\u2019re the right things.\u201d\n\nHad Texas expanded Medicaid to cover more adults under federal health care reform, the federal government would have covered 100 percent of the cost for three years, eventually reducing its coverage to 90 percent. Davis criticized Republicans\u2019 opposition to the offer, which she noted was projected to create as many as 300,000 jobs in the state.\n\n\u201cOnce again, we\u2019ve got people who are more interested in partisan rhetoric than being leaders for our state,\u201d Davis said.\n\nDavis spoke at length during the hourlong interview with Smith about her plans if she wins her race against Republican Attorney General Greg Abbott. She singled out two bills \u2014 a repeal of the state\u2019s in-state tuition law for illegal immigrants and an \u201cArizona-style\u201d immigration bill banning sanctuary cities \u2014 as measures she would veto if they reached her desk as governor.\n\nOf the in-state tuition repeal, which has strong support among Republicans in the Texas Senate, Davis said she'd \"veto it in a heartbeat.\"\n\nGiven the Legislature\u2019s likely makeup next year, Davis said she was pessimistic that a measure to repeal the abortion restrictions she filibustered last year would ever make it to her desk, though she would sign it if it did. She said it was the same case for a bill that would put the state\u2019s redistricting process under an independent commission,\n\nSmith began the interview asking Davis about Friday\u2019s televised debate with Abbott. He questioned why she didn\u2019t respond to Abbott when he asked her at the debate if she regrets voting for President Obama.\n\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t regret it,\u201d Davis said. She suggested that she didn\u2019t answer Abbott\u2019s question at the time because she thought it wasn\u2019t valid in the \u201ccontext\u201d of a gubernatorial debate.\n\n\u201cI thought it was striking that when he had the one opportunity to ask me a question, instead of asking me who I would be as governor, he asked me who I voted for for president,\u201d Davis said.\n\nOn education, Davis revealed that she expects her proposal for a statewide pre-kindergarten program in Texas for 4-year-olds to cost $700 million, and plans for the service to be offered on a \u201csliding scale.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt matters because if we don\u2019t invest in them, it will hurt our state economy in the future,\u201d Davis said.\n\nDavis was more circumspect when asked about a plan proposed by Democratic lieutenant governor candidate Leticia Van de Putte to tap the state\u2019s Rainy Day Fund for $2 billion to subsidize community college tuition.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel like I understand enough about her particular plan,\u201d Davis said, though she said she looked forward to seeing the Legislature consider it. Minutes later, her campaign tweeted from Davis\u2019 account: \u201cYou won't find a bigger supporter of community college than me. #tribunefest\u201d\n\nDespite polls showing her trailing Abbott, Davis expressed confidence that she would win on Election Day. She noted that when she unseated state Sen. Kim Brimer, a Fort Worth Republican, in 2008, her campaign was trailing further at this point in the race than she currently is against Abbott. She also said the reaction she is seeing when she campaigns across Texas gives her confidence that pundits will be surprised by this year\u2019s turnout and outcome.\n\n\u201cWe have built an infrastructure of people who for the first time in a long time that their voices can really matter at the ballot box in a gubernatorial race in Texas,\u201d Davis said.\n\nDuring an audience question-and-answer portion of the event, one questioner noted Davis\u2019 past criticism of Perry, particularly allegations of cronyism, and asked how Davis could launch a law firm with Brian Newby, Gov. Rick Perry\u2019s former chief of staff. Davis and Newby launched Newby Davis in 2010.\n\n\u201cMy law partner is no more the double twin to Rick Perry than I am to any other person,\u201d Davis said. \u201cHe\u2019s a fine upstanding human being. And again, because I believe in working in a bipartisan way, I\u2019m very proud to work with a law partner who once served in a Republican administration in this state. \u2026 He is one of the finest human beings I\u2019ve ever met in my life, and I\u2019m proud to call him my law partner.\u201d\n\nAnother questioner loudly asked Davis, \u201cWhy do you want to California my Texas, our Texas?\u201d a line similar to one Abbott has lobbed at Davis.\n\nDavis responded that the decision by Texas Republican leaders, and supported by Abbott, to turn down federal Medicaid dollars was sending Texas' tax dollars to California.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s California-ing my Texas,\u201d Davis said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://gilmermirror.com/images/article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "verify-v1": "cnJf+n0zijJm/DSSi60+/M9S2I5I0hubPWs19LuOY98=", "description": "Davis Intends to Use Executive Action, Veto Power if Elected by Aman Batheja , The Texas Tribune Sept. 20, 2014 If elected governor, state Sen.
