Washington currently has fish consumption advisories issued throughout the state.\n\n\u201cThe tribes are not only interested in protecting all the species of fish they eat, but they\u2019re also concerned about protecting their economic interests,\u201d said Ann Seiter, fish consumption rate coordinator for the Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission.\n\nRELATED: Toxic Waters: Consumption Advisories on Life-Giving Year-Round Fish Threaten Health\n\nTribes are calling for major changes in pollution policy. When health officials from Washington and Oregon issued advisories for mid-Columbia River\u2019s resident fish last September due to elevated mercury and PCB levels, tribal leaders were outraged.\n\n\u201cThe focus should not be \u2018Do not eat\u2019\u2013it should be \u2018Clean up\u2019\u2013the Columbia River,\u201d said Yakama Nation Chairman Harry Smiskin in a statement at the time.\n\nThe Umatilla, Yakama, Nez Perce and Warm Springs tribes urged the governors of Washington and Idaho to update water quality standards and fish consumption rates.\n\n\u201cThe tribes believe that the long-term solution to this problem isn\u2019t keeping people from eating contaminated fish\u2014it\u2019s keeping fish from being contaminated in the first place,\u201d Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission Chairman Joel Moffett said in a statement. \u201cArmed with higher fish consumption rates and water quality standards, we hope there will be a greater motivation to remove pollutants from the Columbia River and its tributaries.\u201d\n\nWashington has also issued a lower Columbia advisory that warns of PCBs, DDT and Dioxin as well as other compounds. To the state\u2019s east, an advisory has been issued for the Spokane River, which is contaminated with PCBs, lead and other harmful materials. There is also a statewide mercury advisory.\n\nWashington and Idaho are reevaluating their fish consumption rates, which are used to calculate water quality standards that protect human health. The four Oregon tribes urged Washington and Idaho to adopt at least the same rate that Oregon uses to establish water quality standards protective of all fish consumers in the region, according to the White Salmon Enterprise.\n\nOregon\u2019s 175-grams-per-day suggested consumption is a more accurate representation of how much fish most of Oregon\u2019s residents actually eat. But even that does not go far enough, tribal leaders say. State and federal governments must act to clean the polluted sections of the Columbia River contaminating fish, Smiskin said.\n\n\u201cThe fish advisories confirm what the Yakama Nation has known for decades,\u201d Smiskin said. \u201cState and federal governments can no longer ignore the inadequacy of their regulatory efforts and the failure to clean up the Columbia River.\u201d\n\nThe Yakama Nation repeatedly identified contaminated sites along the Columbia, expressing concerns for the health and culture of the Yakama people and calling upon the state and federal agencies for cleanup actions that would protect the tribe\u2019s resources, retained by them in the Treaty of 1855.\n\n\"The new advisories once again pass the burden of responsibility from industry and government to tribes and people in the region,\" Smiskin said. \"Rather then addressing the contamination, we are being told to reduce our reliance on the Columbia River\u2019s fish.
