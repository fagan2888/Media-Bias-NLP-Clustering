VanDercar, has voluntarily relinquished his license rather than fight a charge of inappropriate prescribing.\n\nVanDercar, who operated Tampa Pain Clinic for many years, faced a state Department of Health complaint filed last year that said he over-prescribed several types of painkillers \u2013 including oxycodone, valium and methadone \u2013 to a patient identified only by his initials, JNE. (The patient was later identified as Jeremy Eubanks, a young UPS driver who was sent to prison after being convicted of robbing pharmacies).\n\nVanDercar and DOH prosecutors had agreed to settle the case with a $15,000 fine, reprimand and permanent ban on prescribing controlled drugs. The agreement said that by signing it the physician was not admitting wrongdoing.\n\nWhen he appeared before the Florida Board of Medicine in August, VanDercar said he had treated Eubanks appropriately and \u201cdid not see any signs of addiction from him.\u201d But the physician said he wanted to avoid the lengthy evidentiary process at the Division of Administrative Hearings since he had to undergo cancer surgery. He said he had sold his pain clinic and had withdrawn from practicing medicine.\n\nUsually, the Board of Medicine accepts settlements. But at the hearing, the patient\u2019s mother, Laurie Eubanks, persuaded them that the penalty amounted to \u201ca slap on the wrist.\u201d\n\n\u201cDr. VanDercar will probably retire and feel no penalty,\u201d she said at the hearing. \u201cHe\u2019s being ordered to pay a fine that is minimal compared to the money he has made (at the pain clinic).\u201d\n\nAfter hearing from both sides, the Board of Medicine rejected the settlement. It counter-offered to resolve the case by suspending VanDercar\u2019s license until he passed a state review of his practice.\n\n\n\nDr. Nabil El Sanadi of Fort Lauderdale persuaded fellow board members that the penalties in the settlement did not go far enough.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s our job to protect the public,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to suspend these doctors and send the message that what they are doing is not OK.\u201d\n\nThe board cannot suspend a physician who appears on a settlement agreement; it can only request that DOH prosecutors seek a suspension through a formal hearing if the physician will not agree to it. The Secretary of DOH, the surgeon general, can suspend a doctor\u2019s license on an emergency basis if there is legal cause to do so, but even in such cases the physician can often get court permission to resume practice during the appeal.\n\nBy law, when the board gives physicians a counter-offer to the settlement, they have some time to think it over. Ultimately VanDercar voluntarily relinquished his license, which ended the proceedings.", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "A well-known Tampa pain specialist, Dr. David H.
