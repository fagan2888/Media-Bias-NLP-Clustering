Average life expectancy has increased by 10 years since 1970, and the number of doctors in all OECD countries has increased by absolute numbers and per capita (pdf, pg 80).\n\nBut when it comes to spending, the US\u2019s massive health care expenses are not reaping returns.\n\nAccording to the study, the United States spends more money per capita than any other OECD country on health care\u2014about $8,713 per person, more than twice the OECD average of $3,453.\n\nYet Americans face an average life expectancy of 78.3 years, below the OECD average of 80.5, and just on par with Chile.\n\nHere\u2019s another way to look at it, courtesy of the OECD report:\n\nNorway, Greece, Japan, Slovenia, and many other countries spend less money on health care, but have citizens that live just as long as Americans, or even longer.\n\nThis extra spending is not going to top-quality care, and sometimes not to care at all\u2014the US wastes about $750 billion a year patching up the system\u2019s inefficiencies, including poor administration, unnecessary services, and fraud.\n\nThe report did show a slight decline in the number of uninsured US citizens. The percentage of uninsured Americans dropped from 15% to 11% between 2013 and 2015, the study said, because of the implementation of the Affordable Care Act.", "article_metadata": {"bitly-verification": "3cc1017cee1d", "description": "If you live in a one of the world's more developed countries, chances are your access to quality health care has gotten better within the past ten years.
