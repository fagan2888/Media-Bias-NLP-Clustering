What was supposed to be an easy November win for incumbent Sen. Pat Roberts has turned into the race of his career against independent challenger Greg Orman. As Roberts\u2019 campaign tries to paint Orman as a Liberal Democrat in disguise, Orman has won support campaigning against Roberts as a Washington insider and part of the problem in Congress. KPR\u2019s Stephen Koranda highlights the sparring on the campaign trail.\n\nAt a campaign office in Topeka, Senator Pat Roberts is meeting with dozens of supporters. His decades of campaigning show. He\u2019s jovial, and polished when speaking with people and shaking hands.\n\nAt events like this, Roberts\u2019 main message is that this isn\u2019t just about Kansas. He has called this a \u201cnational campaign,\u201d and he says electing him will help solidify a Republican majority in the U.S. Senate.\n\n\u201cWith a Republican majority, we can repeal Obamacare, we can stop amnesty, open the Keystone pipeline and grow the economy,\u201d says Roberts.\n\nRoberts mentions his experience and accomplishments at stops like this, but those aren\u2019t his main focus.\n\nHe\u2019s been criticized for his decades in Washington, especially in the primary, with claims he\u2019s been there too long.\n\nAfter a tough primary fight and falling behind in some polls, Roberts has been working to shore-up his Republican base. He\u2019s even brought in some big name Republicans to help him campaign.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had everybody from Jeb Bush to Sarah Palin. It shows you that every segment of the Republican Party is united behind my race,\u201d says Roberts.\n\n\u201cWhat does Pat Roberts stand for? You\u2019ve seen it. A constitutional conservative, a fiscal conservative, a social conservative,\u201d says Tom Coburn, a conservative Republican senator from Oklahoma who is joining Roberts at this campaign stop.\n\nCoburn repeats the second main point Roberts is pushing: the claim that independent Greg Orman isn\u2019t really so independent.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a liberal Democrat cloaking himself as a moderate independent, and he\u2019s anything but that,\u201d says Coburn.\n\nIn Roberts\u2019 ads and speeches, he mentions President Obama and Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid repeatedly.\n\nHe says a vote for Orman is a vote for President Obama\u2019s agenda and he points out that Orman has given money to several Democrats. But Orman is firing back.\n\n\u201cSome of the contributions he\u2019s failed to talk about are my contributions to Republicans,\u201d says Orman.\n\nOrman says he\u2019s been both a Republican and a Democrat, he\u2019s donated to both parties and he\u2019s been dissatisfied with both.\n\nHe touts his business experience as a successful entrepreneur and says that has required him to fix problems on a daily basis.\n\n\u201cIf you want to look at how my history defines me, my history defines me as a fiscally responsible, socially tolerant businessman who really just wants to solve problems,\u201d says Orman.\n\nSome of Orman\u2019s business dealings haven\u2019t helped him in the race. The Roberts campaign points to lawsuits against him and connections to someone jailed for insider trading.\n\nSpeaking after a recent debate, Orman took aim at Roberts\u2019 argument that a Republican majority would end gridlock in the Senate.\n\n\u201cAfter 47 years in Washington, he\u2019s telling us that he\u2019s the solution to the gridlock in Washington. I want to know how someone who didn\u2019t talk about working together up there, spent all his time talking about fighting, how that person actually is able to move into an environment where we solve problems,\u201d says Orman.\n\nOrman says he would likely caucus with whichever party has a clear majority in the U.S. Senate. If neither has a majority, he\u2019ll choose the party that is willing to take up his ideas.\n\nOrman doesn\u2019t have the campaign experience of Roberts, but he has a bright smile and youthful charm on the campaign trail.\n\nHe also has a lot of money, a personal fortune and impressive campaign donations for an independent candidate. That\u2019s helped him hit the airwaves.\n\n\u201cAs an independent, I won\u2019t answer to either party, I\u2019ll answer only to the people of Kansas,\u201d says Orman.\n\n\u201cThis has been a bizarre election,\u201d says Fort Hays State University political science professor Chapman Rackaway.\n\nHe says Roberts has experience and a voting record that should appeal to many Kansans, but there\u2019s some anti-incumbency feelings in the air that could be stirred up by touting his experience.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s exactly the tightrope that Senator Roberts walks,\u201d says Rackaway.\n\nRackaway says Orman\u2019s outsider angle helps him. He says political outsiders like Orman can make promises about what they\u2019ll do if elected, but without a past record of political experience it\u2019s hard to judge those promises.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no record of their performance to run on, and so it ends up being very much a measure of their personality,\u201d says Rackaway.\n\nNo matter who is elected, Rackaway says this is the first time since Ross Perot ran for president in 1992 that an independent candidate has made such a major splash in Kansas.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In an election season when party control of the U.S. Senate is on the line, the GOP is facing a surprisingly challenging battle for Kansas.
