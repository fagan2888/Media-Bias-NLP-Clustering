Sept. 2014: Kaiser announces it will pay the fine, cancelling a month-long public hearing. Monday: Some 2,600 mental health professionals are to begin a weeklong strike.\n\nMost of Kaiser Permanente\u2019s 2,600 mental health professionals \u2014 members of the National Union of Healthcare Workers \u2014 are expected to start a weeklong strike at 6 a.m. Monday, where they hope to draw attention to what they call a \u201cchronic failure\u201d to provide members with timely, quality mental health care.\n\nThe union alleges that Kaiser Permanente does not staff its behavioral health staff with enough clinicians to treat the growing number of patients \u2014 in violation of state mandates and industry standards.\n\nIn its statements, the union likens the situation to last year\u2019s Veterans Administration scandal, where long delays in receiving medical care became a national issue.\n\nResponding to the charge, Kaiser Permanente executives said while they are battling a nationwide shortage in behavioral health specialists, they have increased hiring in these specialties last year and plan to continue the trend.\n\nIn 2014, a year when California Kaiser Permanente membership ranks swelled 8 percent, KP hired 25 percent more mental health professionals than the previous year, John Nelson, Kaiser Permanente vice president of government relations said last week.\n\nUnion officials say the Affordable Care Act has made the staffing situation in behavioral health even worse.\n\nStarting Monday and continuing through Friday, union members will be on 65 picket lines at more than 35 locations throughout the state, including West Los Angeles and Fontana medical centers Monday, West Covina and Ontario Tuesday and Woodland Hills and Fontana medical centers Thursday.\n\nUnion ranks include 108 members in Fontana and 56 in Ontario, said Justin DeFreitas, a union spokesman.\n\nUnion membership includes psychologists, therapists and social workers.\n\nIn 2013, Kaiser Permanente was fined $4 million by the California Department of Managed Health Care, the second largest fine in the history of the agency and the largest fine ever in the behavioral health realm.\n\nKaiser Permanente considered the fine \u201cexcessive\u201d and countered that state allegations that documents were falsified were, in fact, accommodations made by appointment schedulers seeking accommodate patients who did not want to be seen within the 10-day period, Nelson said.\n\nNelson took a swipe at the striking NUHW, saying that in the five years that this union has existed, Kaiser Permanente has reached contract agreements with more than 30 other bargaining units.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe union has not secured its first collective bargaining agreement with Kaiser Permanente.\n\n\u201cWe support the right for employees to choose unions. Unions are in our DNA,\u201d he said,\n\nThe union maintains that it is only Kaiser\u2019s collective bargaining unit to tackle the issue of the quality of care that Kaiser delivers.\n\nAmong its allegations is that delays in behavioral health services has resulted in several suicides, a charge Nelson denied.\n\nMarsha Grilli, a Milpitas city councilwoman, saidthat her sister committed suicide while waiting for an appointment to see her psychiatrist.\n\nThe doctor would not increase the frequency of the visits \u2014 every six weeks \u2014 even though her sister\u2019s mental condition was deteriorating rapidly.\n\n\u201cNobody felt the urgency we felt,\u201d she said.\n\nState regulations require that new non-urgent patients be seen by a health profession within 10 business days.\n\nNelson said that Kaiser Permanente is now in compliance with the regulations, but union officials say it is not.\n\nElizabeth White, a licensed clinical social worker in West Los Angeles, said she has a lot of children in her practice and often can\u2019t see them on a timely basis.\n\n\u201cMost children bounce back quickly from divorce and domestic violence if they can be seen on a weekly basis,\u201d she said.\n\nBut often, because of the limitations on when they can see a therapist, they can\u2019t get in more than once a month, which, White said, isn\u2019t often enough to continue the forward momentum of one-on-one sessions.\n\nAnd children \u2014 as well as adults \u2014 can benefit from group therapy sessions.\n\nBut often there isn\u2019t space to hold one.\n\n\u201cThere has been no effort to plan space for more groups,\u201d said White, who is a member of the union\u2019s bargaining committee.\n\nNelson said that behavioral health lacks the large body of \u201cbest practices\u201d which family medicine and other medical specialties involving the body have accumulated over the years.\n\nOn its own and with others, KP is seeking to find protocols which bring the most favorable results for behavior health patients.\n\nThis process would look at issues of frequency and duration of therapy, among other issues, he said.\n\nDuring contract talks, the NHWU has proposed the creation of clinician-management committee in each facility that can work together to determine adequate staffing levels and outsourcing needs.\n\nIn a statement, Kaiser has said it has implemented \u201ccomprehensive contingency plans throughout the region to ensure the continued care, service and safety of our members, patients before, during and after the work stoppage..,\u201d\n\n\u201cOur hope is that the success of this action to deal with mental health will be a catalyst for other providers, and society in general, to treat mental health on the same level of care as physical health,\u201d said Sal Rosselli, the NUHW president.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Most of Kaiser Permanente\u2019s 2,600 mental health professionals
