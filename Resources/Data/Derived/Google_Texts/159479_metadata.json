While Cole is pretty popular overseas, a lot of folks who reside in the US probably aren\u2019t overly familiar with her work. Of course, this doesn\u2019t mean you should start shooting nasty message to the woman on Twitter.\n\nAccording to India Today, Cheryl Cole doesn\u2019t have any time to waste on trolls who spend all their free time stirring up trouble online. Although her recent declaration will probably inspire a new wave of hate to wash over her accounts, Cole is standing firmly behind her position on the matter.\n\n\u201cFirstly, I only follow nice, positive people. Secondly, if someone takes the time to follow me and write a horrible comment, I just think, \u2018Oh, loser, get a life\u2019. What are you doing on my feed?\u2019 So no, I\u2019ve learnt not to take any notice, in this business you cannot,\u201d Cole recently explained to Bang Showbiz.\n\nShe added, \u201cTwitter can be twisted by the media. I might write something and it can be taken completely out of context. But Instagram can\u2019t be. I use it to tell my fans about what\u2019s going on in my life and the things that I like.\u201d\n\nIn other words, don\u2019t post stuff like this:\n\nCheryl cole is a racist but loves getting piped by black men. Doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s not racist lol \u2014 LeNiggaAintShit\u2019Quan (@LeroyAFC) June 1, 2014\n\nInstead of messing with the singer on social media, why not do something positive and take an interest in her career? A good place to start is her upcoming single, which Cheryl Cole intends to unleash on the world in the very near future.\n\nDigital Spy reports that Polydor Records will unveil \u201cCrazy Stupid Love\u201d on July 20. Cole reportedly teamed up with English rapper Tinie Tempah to bring the track to life. Fans who reside in the UK can expect to hear the song on certain radio stations this Monday (June 2).\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t remember being so excited to be releasing new music. After taking some time out I feel brand new and I had such a special time making this record,\u201d she explained.\n\nAre you a fan of Cheryl Cole? Are you surprised that people spend so much time sending nasty message to the singer on Twitter?\n\n[Image via Bing]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Cheryl Cole thinks people who spend time harassing celebrities on social media are the scum of the earth.
