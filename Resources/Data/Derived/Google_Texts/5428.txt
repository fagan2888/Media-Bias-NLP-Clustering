A newborn baby girl is in the hospital after she was found buried alive, under asphalt and rubble, Los Angeles officials said.

Authorities received a report Friday afternoon of a baby crying in a riverbed in Compton, a city in southern L.A. County, the Los Angeles Sheriffâ€™s Department said.

Responding deputies heard a baby's muffled cry, said the sheriff's department, and as they searched inside a crevice along a bike path, they found the baby girl buried under pieces of asphalt and rubble.

She was believed to have been born within the last 36 to 48 hours, the sheriff's department said today. The baby "was wrapped in a blanket and cold to the touch," the sheriff's department said.

The baby was hospitalized in stable condition, officials said, and will remain at the hospital for observation.
