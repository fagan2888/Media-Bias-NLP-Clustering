The Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall Consolidated Tax Center will open Jan. 19, providing free individual income tax preparation and e-filing services to service members, retirees and their families.\n\n\n\nLocated in Building 205 at 101 Bloxon Street on the Fort Myer portion of the joint base, the consolidated tax center made its debut in 2015, combining the Fort Myer and Henderson Hall tax centers into one location.\n\n\n\nThe consolidated tax center will be staffed by Soldiers, Marines and civilian volunteers, all of whom are IRS-trained and certified tax preparers, said Philip Jussel, senior paralegal for Joint Force Headquarters-National Capital Region and the Military District of Washington.\n\n\n\nThe facility will provide cost-free federal and state income tax return preparation and e-filing for military personnel, their families and other eligible clients throughout the 2015 tax season. Tax center staffers will also help with itemized deductions and certain self-employment income and expenses.\n\n\n\nChange in services\n\nJussel noted that the tax center will not be able to provide some services that it did last year.\n\n\n\n\u201cAcross DoD, we are not going to be able to do some returns that we did last year,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nDuring the 2016 tax season, only individual tax returns, not business tax returns, can be prepared, according to Jussel. This is because regulations prohibit government assistance to most business interests, and because the IRS considers tax preparation part of the cost of running a business.\n\n\n\nExceptions will be made for child care providers operating on-post or on-base child care facilities, he said.\n\n\n\nRetired reservists who are not yet drawing their pensions, or 'gray area' retirees, will also be ineligible for services this year, according to Jussel. Reserve component Service Members who are not on active duty for more than 29 days will not be able to use the tax center, and activated reserve members will need to bring a copy of their active duty orders.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, because of changes in tax law, people earning more than $300,000 per year are not eligible and should seek services with other tax preparers, Jussel said, recommending that those taxpayers seek the services of a full-time tax professional.\n\n\n\nJussel stressed that if a customer is active-duty, then the tax center will do their tax returns no matter what.\n\n\n\n\u201cI want to make sure people understand, if they\u2019re active duty, it doesn\u2019t matter how much money they make\u2013we\u2019ll take care of them,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nBut high-ranking customers with high incomes and complex returns will be better served with a financial planner, according to Jussel.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re making so much money, that when we start doing their tax returns, they start losing a lot of benefits,\u201d Jussel said. \u201cWe\u2019re doing simple tax returns, and if you\u2019re making over $250,000, you have a complex tax return. We don\u2019t want to do returns for people and have them not get their maximum benefit. Those folks need to go see a financial planner.\u201d\n\n\n\nNew laws, new requirements\n\nFinally, Jussel said that the Affordable Care Act could impact some taxpayers this year, but not many.\n\n\n\nThe ACA requires every American to have \u201cminimal essential coverage,\u201d he said. Active duty service members are covered through the military; most family members and retirees are covered by Tricare; and many other retirees are covered by either Medicare of Medicaid.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe people who may not qualify are family members who got married during the year and weren\u2019t covered by Tricare all year,\u201d Jussel said. \u201cThose are not common, but we are very good at dealing with their Affordable Care Act Issues.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe tax center will be open Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. and Tuesday and Thursday 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m beginning Jan. 19. A grand opening ceremony is scheduled for Jan. 20.\n\n\n\nIn the event of inclement weather, customers should consult the JBM-HH CTC webpage page at http://go.usa.gov/cnu9J, the JBM-HH Facebook page at www.facebook.com/MYERTAXCENTER or the OPM weather page at www.opm.gov/status.
