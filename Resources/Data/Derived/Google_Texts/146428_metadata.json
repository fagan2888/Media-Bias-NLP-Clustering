The news conference was in North Charleston\u2019s City Hall, which would soon become a focal point for international attention.\n\nNorth Charleston Police Chief Eddie Driggers has a reputation as an affable, compassionate man with a keen sense of right and wrong, but some question whether that will be enough to lead his department through the biggest challenge it has ever faced.\n\nDriggers, who came out of retirement from law enforcement two years ago to become North Charleston\u2019s top cop, finds himself under national scrutiny in the wake of Walter Scott\u2019s shooting earlier this month.\n\nHe received good marks for his condemnation of the 50-year-old black man\u2019s death at the hands of a white police officer. But his work has only just begun as Driggers attempts to guide the embattled department toward what one city official called \u201ca new normal.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a job that goes well beyond keeping the city\u2019s streets peaceful as the judicial case against Scott proceeds. Driggers will guide the department as all officers start wearing body cameras and as it engages the community in a frank discussion about its policies and procedures.\n\nHis challenge also involves tackling a problem that existed long before Patrolman 1st Class Michael Slager was videotaped firing eight shots at Scott as he ran from a traffic stop: improving trust and cooperation between the police and those they serve.\n\nThat goal, which has only been made more challenging by Scott\u2019s killing, has been thwarted for decades by complaints of racial profiling, harassment and excessive force that have shaped the department\u2019s reputation, some North Charleston residents said.\n\nFor them, Scott\u2019s death wasn\u2019t an outlier, but indicative of what those who know and live on the city\u2019s streets have been saying for years.\n\nDriggers had already begun chipping away at the issue. Since taking over as police chief in 2013, Driggers has reached out to the community by meeting with activists, sponsoring youth athletic programs and other activities. But some have questioned whether that is enough to impart the sort of sweeping change that many residents believe is needed.\n\nSoft-spoken and self-effacing, Driggers\u2019 current job caps a lengthy law enforcement career that began as a patrolman on North Charleston\u2019s streets in 1975. He went on to work for the Charleston County Sheriff\u2019s Office and the Coastal Crisis Chaplaincy before returning to the North Charleston Police Department as its leader.\n\nAs befitting Driggers\u2019 status as an Episcopal deacon, his leadership style is to de-emphasize himself, or to put his role in a larger perspective.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just a part of that cog in the machine,\u201d he said in an interview shortly after the Scott shooting. \u201cEverybody always says, \u2018How do you do your job?\u2019 I say I do my job because I\u2019m 343-strong. Sworn. There are over 400 men and women who work here at the city of North Charleston, and they all have the same goal \u2014 to serve and protect.\u201d\n\n\u2018Very decisive\u2019\n\nAs president of the Charleston NAACP, Dot Scott has been as vocal a critic as North Charleston police has encountered in recent years.\n\nBut Dot Scott, who lives in North Charleston, said she does not think Slager\u2019s shooting of Scott reflects poorly on the chief\u2019s leadership.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s unfortunate it happened on his watch,\u201d she said. \u201cIt sits on his table because these are the people that he\u2019s more or less responsible for their behavior. I think that\u2019s the extent that it goes.\u201d\n\nDavid Thomas, a senior research fellow with the Police Foundation, a Washington-based nonprofit that studies how police can improve, has looked at how several police departments have handled a crisis moment like the Slager case.\n\nThomas, himself a former police officer, said Driggers and the city\u2019s leadership \u201cdid an excellent job,\u201d in part because they acted quickly to announce Slager would be charged with murder.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at a lot of these other cases, it seems like the department and the prosecutor\u2019s office hide behind statute because they\u2019re afraid to make a decision,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were very decisive with what they did, and I have to support them on that.\u201d\n\nHe added that the cellphone video helped make the case \u201cpretty clear cut. In other cases, you don\u2019t have video, so you have to follow the evidence,\u201d he said.\n\nCity Councilman Ron Brinson also gave the chief a high mark for his leadership in response to the incident.\n\n\u201cFrom what I see, he\u2019s very much leading from the front. He\u2019s showing a lot of compassion,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t see why anyone would question his leadership today as a result of how he\u2019s acted so far.\u201d\n\nSeveral of the residents the chief has sworn to protect and serve, however, weren\u2019t so quick to sing his praises.\n\nOne young man walking along Rivers Avenue on a recent afternoon described Driggers as \u201cirrelevant\u201d in controlling the actions of individual officers that he alleged were \u201cterrorizing\u201d communities in the area. He refused to identify himself for fear of being harassed by police.\n\n\u201cHe ain\u2019t handling it worth a nickel, if you ask me,\u201d said another man, Nathan Johnson.\n\nThe 59-year-old was born and raised in North Charleston\u2019s predominantly black Ten Mile community. He recently spoke of Driggers and his experiences with the city\u2019s police department while chatting with five other men of a similar age who had gathered beneath a bay of trees in the neighborhood.\n\n\u201cIt all starts from the top,\u201d Johnson said, saying Driggers ultimately is responsible for the actions of his officers.\n\nJohnson said he wasn\u2019t impressed by Driggers while watching news conferences on television in the days after Scott\u2019s death. The chief\u2019s voice had quivered during statements in the week after the shooting, and he occasionally appeared on the verge of tears as he addressed local and national reporters.\n\n\u201cHe couldn\u2019t even talk,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThe mayor had to talk for him.\u201d\n\nThe others with Johnson said they weren\u2019t even certain what Driggers looked like. They said they didn\u2019t believe he made much of an effort to get to know residents in the city\u2019s predominantly black neighborhoods.\n\nThe police department is about 18 percent black in a city that is 45 percent black.\n\nIf more training on community and race relations is needed in that department, Johnson said, it\u2019s Driggers\u2019 responsibility to make that happen.\n\n\u201cQuit stereotyping,\u201d another man said.\n\nHe, like the rest of the group, refused to identify himself for fear of police retaliation.\n\n\u201cOnce they know who you are, they\u2019ll start gunning for you,\u201d he said. \u201cThey harass when you talk against them.\u201d\n\nThe man described watching officers ignore a group of white men who were hanging out on a nearby street, choosing instead to focus their attention on black men who were standing nearby.\n\nInteractions with police often escalate, he said, because of the attitudes of the officers when approaching black residents.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t know how to talk to people,\u201d he said, \u201cbut they\u2019ve got to at least respect you for being a human, don\u2019t they? That\u2019s what I was taught.\u201d\n\nA good track record\n\nDriggers met or exceeded all expectations set for him over the last two years, according to personnel evaluations that rated his work ethic, knowledge of the job, judgment, leadership skills and other qualities. The evaluations, conducted by the mayor\u2019s office, were released last week by the city of North Charleston in response to a Freedom of Information Act request from The Post and Courier.\n\nCity officials who have watched the chief have said they welcomed his approach, which they described as a personable one.\n\nBrinson said he was concerned when former Chief Jon Zumalt left abruptly. His tenure was marked by a decrease in the city\u2019s crime rate but a rise in complaints that the police presence and their tactics were too aggressive, particularly in minority neighborhoods.\n\nDriggers has helped ease such complaints, Brinson said. \u201cI have actually seen him resolve some neighborhood concerns or issues by going and knocking on the door, so he\u2019s out there,\u201d Brinson said.\n\nLt. Dan Isgett of the Charleston County Sheriff\u2019s Office, who oversees the county\u2019s Community Liaison unit, knows Driggers from the chief\u2019s time at the county.\n\n\u201cHe cares deeply for people, whether it\u2019s law enforcement officers or the victims\u2019 families, no matter who it is,\u201d Isgett said. \u201cHe takes it personally, but he\u2019s the right man at the right time at the right place for this. I feel that he\u2019s got the right combination of skills to handle this situation.\u201d\n\nBrinson said that empathy will help Driggers in the months ahead.\n\n\u201cThe next challenge for Chief Driggers is to make sure, with this new normal, he provides the kind of leadership to keep this moving forward,\u201d Brinson said. \u201cAnd I think he\u2019s up to it. You can\u2019t have too much empathy in a situation like this, and I think his men and women recognize the value of that.\u201d\n\nThe challenges ahead\n\nWhile Driggers is warm and personable in a small group, he can appear uncomfortable while speaking in public, such as at the news conferences immediately following Scott\u2019s death.\n\nHe declined an interview request for this story.\n\nCharleston County Sheriff Al Cannon said Driggers\u2019 unease with public speaking is part of the job.\n\n\u201cWhen you know you don\u2019t have the answers to a lot of the questions that are likely to be asked, it makes any of us uncomfortable,\u201d Cannon said.\n\nSharing certain information can affect potential witness statements as an investigation continues. \u201cThose sorts of things make it really complicated, and quite frankly, police departments around the country are struggling with that because the normal process is one that takes some time if you are going to be as thorough as you need to be,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd there is the issue of the city\u2019s rising crime rate.\n\nLast year, North Charleston again led the region in homicides, three years after posting its lowest murder rate in decades, an achievement attributed in part to the aggressive policing instituted by Driggers\u2019 predecessor, Chief Jon Zumalt. Last year, the city had 22 killings, up from 16 deaths in 2013, 13 in 2012 and five in 2011.\n\nDriggers said all but two of those slain knew their killer in some way, and illegal drugs played a part in some killings, as did gangs. The increase also matched a larger trend in a rising number of murders across the region.\n\nDriggers has said he hasn\u2019t seen any overall trends emerge to explain the violence, and about 1 percent of the city\u2019s population is causing most of the problems.\n\n\u201cThese crimes are committed by the same people \u2014 most of them in the criminal element \u2014 over and over,\u201d he said in an interview late last year. \u201cWe need to start blaming the people responsible for these things and not taking it out on the entire population.\u201d\n\nChanging cultures\n\nLatorcha Montgomery of James Island estimated that she has been stopped as many as 10 times by North Charleston police in recent years, including at least one instance where she felt she was racially profiled, perhaps because she drove a BMW.\n\n\u201cTo be honest with you, because of all the things that are currently happening, I try to take different routes to get to where I need to go so I wouldn\u2019t have to go in the heart of North Charleston,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing that the past five years.\u201d\n\nA middle-age white man who lives in North Charleston\u2019s Ashley Heights neighborhood welcomed the idea of the city\u2019s police force being outfitted with body cameras, but he said that alone wouldn\u2019t be enough to change the department for the better. \u201cFire all their asses \u2014 the chief too,\u201d he said. The man refused to identify himself, citing fears of future harassment.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve got too many young ones over there who just got out of the service,\u201d he said. \u201cAll they know is toting a gun.\u201d\n\nPaul Pinckney Jr., a 75-year-old lifelong resident of North Charleston\u2019s Accabee neighborhood, said he\u2019s maintained a low profile and stayed away from criminal activity to avoid having a bad encounter with the city\u2019s police department.\n\n\u201cWhen you see them rough handling the young ones, it can look pretty bad,\u201d he said. But he added that sometimes officers have no choice but to be aggressive for the sake of maintaining control.\n\nQuestions of force aside, Pinckney said he appreciated the consistent patrols the officers made in his neighborhood to improve safety.\n\n\u201cBack in the day, the only time police would come around here was if they were whipping heads,\u201d he said.\n\nDot Scott said the Walter Scott shooting raises the question of how the North Charleston Police Department can rid itself of the bad apples.\n\n\u201cI really believe it\u2019s just a few of them,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think in any way this is a mind-set of the majority of these officers, but it\u2019s a culture we have allowed to breed at this point.\u201d\n\nDot Scott said she would like to see a citizens review board not \u201chandpicked with cheerleaders\u201d to improve transparency.\n\nWhether it\u2019s a citizens review board, policy changes or more community outreach, Mayor Keith Summey said the city\u2019s main crime-fighting challenge is convincing residents to trust and work with police when they know someone is breaking the law.\n\n\u201cPeople are fearful of giving us information because they\u2019re fearful of retaliation,\u201d Summey said. \u201cEverything that happens in this community, somebody knows about it. It\u2019s getting them to tell us about it that\u2019s the difficult part.\u201d\n\nSummey said he would like to see more families stand up to their children much like the city stood up to Slager after he shot Walter Scott.\n\n\u201cWe need families to stand up to kids and say, \u2018You\u2019re wrong,\u2019 and if they can\u2019t get them to work out, let us get engaged to try to help them change before it\u2019s too late,\u201d Summey said. \u201cA slap on the hand could lead to the saving of a life.\u201d\n\nBrenda Rindge contributed to this report.
