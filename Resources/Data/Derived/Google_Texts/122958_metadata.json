The discovery reflects the earliest evidence of water having existed on Mars. The past existence of less dry, rocky and harsh conditions on the planet is reflected in a group of rocks at Endeavor known as the Matjevic Formation.\n\nPrevious evidence of the past existence of water on Mars, the Red Planet, was gathered by the Mars rover, Curiosity. In September, Curiosity found traces of water evident in Martian soil. Then, in December, the rover\u2019s findings indicated that a freshwater lake of the life-giving liquid had likely been present on the planet approximately 3.5 billion years ago. The confirmation by a second rover, Opportunity, that water existed on Mars, gives scientists and researchers increased hope for the possibility of finding evidence that life could, in fact, have existed sustainably there at some point.\n\nThe findings of both Curiosity and Opportunity indicate to scientists that at one time fresh, drinkable groundwater may have been flowing on the planet but that it became more alkaline and acidic over time.\n\nAccording to NASA, Opportunity isn\u2019t able to perform the same kinds of tests as Curiosity to determine all of the organic chemicals that might be present in the samples it gathers. Nonetheless, the researchers continue to be pleased with Opportunity\u2019s performance after 10 years and approximately 24 miles of Martian surface covered. The Mars rover was originally intended to operate for just 90 days. Opportunity is still going strong even in the face of one of its six wheels going bad and the existence of \u201can arthritic robotic arm.\u201d The rover landed with a twin, Spirit, that worked on the planet for about six years before being declared \u201cdead.\u201d It is currently hoped that Opportunity will be able to use its powers of observation to assist NASA scientists in determining how rocks were formed on the planet.\n\nThis new discovery is only one of several credited to Opportunity. The Rover is also credited with the recent discovery of the now famous Martian \u201cjelly doughnut\u201d rock discovered earlier this month. The mysterious rock showed up seemingly out of nowhere in Opportunity\u2019s view. It is theorized that it either landed nearby the rover as a result of an impact or that one of Opportunity\u2019s wheels simply kicked it up onto the soil. Examination has revealed that it\u2019s unique composition seems to include high levels of iron, sulfur, phosphorous and manganese. According to an Opportunity researcher \u201cIt represents pretty substantial deposition of salts and oxides.\u201d Heated debate about what the rock means for scientists has been ongoing since the discovery. The rock was also discovered on the Endeavor crater where Opportunity is hard at work these days.\n\nNow that this second Mars rover, Opportunity, has confirmed other evidence of the past existence of water on the Red Planet, NASA scientists are anxiously awaiting what the next remarkable discovery will be for this history-making machine.\n\nBy Michele Wessel\n\nSources:\n\nBusiness Week\n\nNBC News\n\nRT\n\nWashington Post\n\nShare this: Print\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nPocket\n\nReddit\n\nEmail\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle\n\nFacebook\n\nTumblr\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Guardian Liberty Voice", "description": "The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has reported that its 10-year-old Mars rover, Opportunity, has become the second to confirm the existence of water on the so-called \u201cR\u2026", "title": "NASA: Second Mars Rover Confirms Existence of Water on Red Planet", "url": "http://guardianlv.com/2014/01/nasa-second-mars-rover-confirms-existence-of-water-on-red-planet/", "image": {"width": 753, "identifier": "http://guardianlv.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/mars1.jpg", "height": 502}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-23T20:51:08+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-23T20:51:08+00:00"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://guardianlv.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/mars1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@ifrackle", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3ebc\"", "article_summary": "Previous evidence of the past existence of water on Mars, the Red Planet, was gathered by the Mars rover, Curiosity.\nNow that this second Mars rover, Opportunity, has confirmed other evidence of the past existence of water on the Red Planet, NASA scientists are anxiously awaiting what the next remarkable discovery will be for this history-making machine.\nThe Mars rover was originally intended to operate for just 90 days.\nThe discovery reflects the earliest evidence of water having existed on Mars.\nThe confirmation by a second rover, Opportunity, that water existed on Mars, gives scientists and researchers increased hope for the possibility of finding evidence that life could, in fact, have existed sustainably there at some point."}
