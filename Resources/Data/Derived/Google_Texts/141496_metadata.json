All of these happened before the age of 50.\n\nThere are many reasons for the health crisis among African Americans, the stress of systematic poverty being chief among them. But there is one major contributing factor that is much easier to fix than economic inequality and it lies within the everyday power of American doctors: better listening skills.\n\nResearch consistently shows that black patients \u2014 especially those who are poor or perceived as less sophisticated \u2014 receive less attention from their doctors during office visits.\n\nUnfortunately, this inattentiveness may result in unnecessary deaths. African Americans die faster for multiple reasons. Among them:\n\nThey are more likely to receive less desirable procedures like amputation as a consequence of diabetes and end-stage renal disease. Rates of amputation are 3.6 times higher for African Americans than for whites, and they are twice as likely to undergo above-knee amputation, according to a 2002 report from the Institute of Medicine.\n\nThey are more likely to be enrolled in lower-end health plans characterized by higher per capita resource constraints and stricter limits on covered services, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation\u2019s \u201cHealth Coverage for the Black Population Today and Under the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nThey are 41 percent less likely to receive a major procedure for treatment of colorectal cancer, according to a study published in the American Journal of Gastroenterology. Despite 20 percent higher rates of in comparison to whites, African Americans receive 28 percent fewer sigmoidoscopic examinations \u2014 a considerably more advanced diagnostic procedure than barium enemas.\n\nI experienced this bias personally. After several sleepless nights, I went to a neurologist about a constant buzzing in my ears. The neurologist\u2019s diagnosis was multiple sclerosis. The conclusion was that I should \u201cconsider taking a steroid and adapt\u201d and talk with my family doctor, who only shrugged and referred me back to the specialist. No other treatments were offered, no readings recommended, and absolutely no time taken to discuss how I felt about the diagnosis.\n\nWe could simply conclude that these are incompetent doctors, but the underlying stereotype of \u201cblacks don\u2019t take care of themselves\u201d is pernicious. Why continue with an approach that obviously is not working? We must disrupt this archaic model and adopt a more ecological perspective.\n\nIn the traditional biomedical practice of medicine, the focus is solely on the doctor-patient interaction in which the doctor controls the conversation by asking specific questions about signs and symptoms, examines the physical body, and then issues a directive for treatment. Most of the questions asked by the doctor are closed-ended and designed to be answered with one word \u2014 yes or no.\n\nAn ecological approach values the voice of a patient in addition to that of the doctor. The communication would be collaborative and much more patient-centered \u2014 a dialogue instead of a questionnaire. This is more complex and time-consuming but can be mainly handled through an intake conducted by a physician\u2019s assistant or a nurse.\n\nA doctor\u2019s appointment should result in more than a summary of tests results, a prescription for drugs, and a mandate to eat healthy and exercise. Shortcuts for gathering patient information must be avoided. Time invested in the beginning of a doctor-patient relationship will be cost-effective in the long term and result in better health outcomes in the African-American community.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Racial minorities experience shorter lives, but until we can fix economic inequality there\u2019s an easy way to improve this health crisis\u2026", "title": "The Stress of Systemic Poverty Is Killing Us \u2014 Pacific Standard", "og": {"site_name": "Medium", "description": "Racial minorities experience shorter lives, but until we can fix economic inequality there\u2019s an easy way to improve this health crisis\u2026", "title": "The Stress of Systemic Poverty Is Killing Us \u2014 Pacific Standard", "url": "https://psmag.com/the-stress-of-systemic-poverty-is-killing-us-1543b5c230e6", "image": "https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*nYKA6WDzbOl0F9QPOvVIHQ.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "always", "twitter": {"creator": "@PacificStand", "label1": "Reading time", "image": {"src": "https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*nYKA6WDzbOl0F9QPOvVIHQ.jpeg"}, "site": "@Medium", "data1": "2 mins", "app": {"url": {"iphone": "medium://p/1543b5c230e6"}, "name": {"iphone": "Medium"}, "id": {"iphone": 828256236}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Pacific Standard", "al": {"web": {"url": "https://psmag.com/the-stress-of-systemic-poverty-is-killing-us-1543b5c230e6"}, "android": {"url": "medium://p/1543b5c230e6", "app_name": "Medium", "package": "com.medium.reader"}, "ios": {"url": "medium://p/1543b5c230e6", "app_name": "Medium", "app_store_id": 828256236}}, "fb": {"app_id": 542599432471018, "smart_publish": {"robots": "noauto"}}, "theme-color": "#000000", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/medium", "published_time": "2016-04-20T15:01:03.109Z", "author": "https://psmag.com/@pacificstand"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "There are many reasons for the health crisis among African Americans, the stress of systematic poverty being chief among them.\nPhysicians have known for years that racial minorities, especially African Americans, experience shorter lives because of a higher-than-average prevalence of maladies like kidney disease, heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and hypertension.\nDespite 20 percent higher rates of in comparison to whites, African Americans receive 28 percent fewer sigmoidoscopic examinations \u2014 a considerably more advanced diagnostic procedure than barium enemas.\nAfrican Americans die faster for multiple reasons.\nAmong them:They are more likely to receive less desirable procedures like amputation as a consequence of diabetes and end-stage renal disease."}
