It was after school on a Friday on her way to work at Swadley's BBQ when she and a co-worker got in a bad accident.\n\n\"We were just having a good time riding around before me and Bailey had to go to work and she lost control, and next thing I know, I'm waking up in a hospital,\" Daley said.\n\nDaley suffered a fractured vertebra, three fractured ribs, a bruised lung and lacerated spleen. And even though she's in a wheelchair with a neck brace, she says she wouldn't miss this dinner for the world.\n\n\"This is the nicest thing anyone has ever done for me,\" Daley said. \"I'm just glad I'm alive, and I'm thankful for everybody's prayers.\"\n\nLong Lines wrapped around for food while raffle tickets sold fast.

Our goal is to let these families know that we're here and this whole entire community along with others are here to support them,\" said benefit organizer Brandi Duvall.\n\n\"It may not make a financial impact, so to speak, but it's going to make an emotional impact for every one of these kids.\"\n\n3/5/2014 Related Story: Second El Reno Teen Dies After Weekend Car Crash\n\nDaley was released from the hospital three days ago and has to take pills four times a day, not including pain medication and a blood thinner shot she has to insert in her stomach. She hopes to be out of her wheelchair and using her walker and going to back to school soon.\n\nDaley is expected to be out of her neck brace in time for graduation on May 23.\n\n\"That's how I've made it through, just all the support,\" Daley said.\n\nAll the money raised will be split among the families of the teens.
