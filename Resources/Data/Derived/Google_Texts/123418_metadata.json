Rick Scott.\n\nSan Francisco-based NextGen Climate Action Committee last month gave $750,000 to its Florida committee, the first contribution in the state. On its website, Scott is listed as one of seven Republican candidates the group is targeting.\n\nThe group was founded by Tom Steyer, who built a $1.6 billion net worth as a hedge fund manager. He\u2019s now using that personal wealth to bankroll campaigns against those he sees as bad for the environment.\n\n\u201cFloridians can\u2019t afford to re-elect Gov. Rick Scott. As a climate denier who refuses to accept basic scientific fact, he has put Florida\u2019s communities, infrastructure and economy directly in harm\u2019s way,\u201d said Suzanne Henkels, a NextGen spokeswoman.\n\n\u201cMaybe Tom Steyer didn\u2019t get the memo that Charlie Crist\u2019s commitment to the environment is all hot air,\u201d Scott\u2019s campaign responded Thursday. \u201cAfter all, Charlie flew on a polluter\u2019s private jet last week from Gainesville to Tallahassee (a two-hour drive), then hopped into a Prius to get to an event where he pretended to care about the environment.\u201d\n\nThe chairman of the NextGen organization\u2019s Florida political arm is Chris Fadeff, NextGen\u2019s chief financial officer. Its political director is Joshua Romero, the former legislative assistant for state Rep. Victor Torres, D-Orlando.\n\nNextGen also has received $100,000 from Barbara Stiefel, a Democratic donor from Coral Gables. This election cycle, she has given nearly $1 million in support of a constitutional amendment that would legalize medical marijuana and another that aims to boost conservation spending.\n\nIt is organized as a so-called \u201celectioneering communication organization,\u201d groups that are set up to buy television commercials and mail pieces. The group also will focus on a program designed to encourage voting by segments of the electorate, including Hispanics and the young, that don\u2019t go to the polls during non-presidential elections.\n\nThe environment has become a higher-profile issue in Florida\u2019s gubernatorial race in recent weeks.\n\nAfter Scott declined to meet with 10 scientists who wanted to talk to him about climate change, the Crist campaign scheduled two meetings that were open to the press.\n\nThose turned into a round of bad headlines, however, when Crist traveled between the events in a private jet owned by James Finch, a developer whose company has been fined by the state for water pollution.\n\nNextGen has positioned itself as the counterweight to the Koch brothers, a set of billionaire businessmen who financially supported Republican candidates and causes usually opposed by environmental groups.\n\n\u201cWe are using our resources to promote an interest that we believe will help our children, while the Koch brothers continue to deny basic science and promote an agenda that will benefit their economic self-interest,\u201d Henkels said.\n\nSteyer, the group\u2019s founder, has faced questions about his environmental background.\n\nEarlier this month, the New York Times reported that Steyer\u2019s fund, Farallon Capital Management, spent millions funding coal projects across the globe. Even though he promised to divest from those projects, they will \u201cgenerate tens of millions of tons of carbon pollution for years, if not decades, to come,\u201d the newspaper reported.\n\nIn an op-ed he wrote responding to the Times\u2019 story, he said he left the firm because his philosophy on the environment changed.\n\n\u201cI could not reconcile my personal values with managing a fund that by mandate is invested in all sectors of the global economy, including fossil fuels,\u201d he wrote in the piece, which was published by Politico, a Washington-based news organization.\n\nOther than Florida, the group will be paying for media buys in governor\u2019s races in Maine and Pennsylvania, and U.S. Senate races in Colorado, Iowa, Michigan, and New Hampshire.\n\nIn its first foray into big state campaigns, the NextGen spent $11 million in the 2013 Virginia governor\u2019s race to help Democrat Terry McAuliffe defeat Republican Ken Cuccinelli.", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sat, 02 Aug 2014 21:05:44 -0400", "Description": "TALLAHASSEE \u2014 A hedge fund billionaire-turned-environmentalist who is seeking to boost the political importance of climate change has his eye on knocking off Florida Gov.
