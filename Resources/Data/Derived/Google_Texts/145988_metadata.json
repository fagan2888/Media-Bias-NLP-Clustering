(AP Photo, File)\n\n\n\n\n\nGRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (WOOD) \u2014 A new survey released Thursday by Grand Valley State University is showing that since the Affordable Care Act was implemented, more small businesses are deciding not to offer health insurance to their employees.\n\nThe survey, conducted by Assistant Professor of Economics Leslie Muller, focused on companies that have fewer than 50 employees. Companies of that size are not mandated by the ACA to offer insurance to employees.\n\n\u201cSmall firms have faced, traditionally faced, higher costs so they\u2019ve been strapped for a while. That doesn\u2019t necessarily have anything to do with the ACA it just has to do with the fact that health care costs have been raising it\u2019s been particularly hard on the small firms,\u201d Muller said.\n\nThe Survey found that of small businesses that offered health insurance over the past two years, only 40 percent plan to offer insurance in 2015 and only 28 percent in 2016.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying these escalating health care costs are due to the ACA. We just don\u2019t know that. We don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen because it\u2019s going to take a couple of years for the markets to play out, even out,\u201d Muller said.\n\nIn fact, Muller says the survey suggests small business may be dropping their health insurance coverage because of the availability of the public health exchange.\n\n68 percent of the small businesses that do not plan on offering insurance in 2015 are encouraging their employees to purchase health insurance on the public exchange.\n\n\u201cIt just now gives them another option I think as to what they can do if they become particularly strapped in money for offering health insurance,\u201d Muller said.\n\nMuller said some workers may end up better off on the exchange, since individuals who earn up to 400% of the poverty level are eligible for federal subsidies, which they wouldn\u2019t get if their employers offered them health insurance.\n\n\u201cEspecially those people that pre-existing conditions, can now go out into this public exchange that the ACA put together and buy insurance and they are not discriminated against because of pre-existing conditions. That was not available before,\u201d Muller said.\n\nOther findings of the survey:\n\nOf those offering plans in 2014, 75 percent plan on offering insurance in 2015. Half of these firms plan on offering plans in 2016.\n\nSixteen percent of firms are uncertain as to whether they will offer insurance in 2015; 28 percent are unsure about 2016.\n\nOf those companies not offering plans in 2015, 68 percent plan on sending employees out to the public exchange to buy individual health insurance.\n\n\u2014\u2013\n\nOnline:\n\nRead the entire survey (pdf)\n\nShare this: Email\n\nPrint\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle\n\nPinterest\n\nMore\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\n\n\nReddit\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new survey released by GVSU is showing that since the Affordable Care Act was implemented, more small businesses are deciding not to offer\u2026", "generator": "WordPress.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=488527284", "og": {"site_name": "WOODTV.com", "description": "A new survey released by GVSU is showing that since the Affordable Care Act was implemented, more small businesses are deciding not to offer health insurance to their employees.", "title": "Study: Small businesses dumping employee health insurance", "url": "http://woodtv.com/2015/01/22/study-small-businesses-dumping-employee-health-insurance/", "image": {"width": 650, "identifier": "https://lintvwood.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/health-overhaul_remp.jpg", "height": 370}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A new survey released by GVSU is showing that since the Affordable Care Act was implemented, more small businesses are deciding not to offer health insurance to their employees.", "title": "Study: Small businesses dumping employee health insurance", "image": {"src": "https://lintvwood.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/health-overhaul_remp.jpg?w=640"}, "creator": "@woodtv", "site": "WOODTV", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Grand Rapids, MI news, weather, sports and traffic", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.linmedia.newstouch.wood", "fb": {"pages": 20114386235}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://woodtv.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/28c7d45e6d62506344f0aad2af937984?s=16", "application-name": "WOODTV.com", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/woodtv", "published_time": "2015-01-23T04:10:30+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-23T04:10:30+00:00"}, "msvalidate.01": "25404283363C09DE121A55A903F03873", "google-site-verification": "nqHTbbkW32A8Ssjvec6oDik57M8cANvAMyR0LzfR1to", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd653c\"", "article_summary": "68 percent of the small businesses that do not plan on offering insurance in 2015 are encouraging their employees to purchase health insurance on the public exchange.\nIn fact, Muller says the survey suggests small business may be dropping their health insurance coverage because of the availability of the public health exchange.\n\u201cIt just now gives them another option I think as to what they can do if they become particularly strapped in money for offering health insurance,\u201d Muller said.\nThe Survey found that of small businesses that offered health insurance over the past two years, only 40 percent plan to offer insurance in 2015 and only 28 percent in 2016.\nCompanies of that size are not mandated by the ACA to offer insurance to employees."}
