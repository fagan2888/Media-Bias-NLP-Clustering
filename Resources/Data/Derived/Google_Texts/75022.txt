As New York University president John Sexton begins the final two years of his tenure, he will consider issues such as student debt, the value of an NYU education and who his successor will be, he said in a recent interview.

“We care about student debt,” Mr. Sexton said. “But the more important thing for us is that when students borrow to go to school they’re getting the best education possible in return for that borrow. That makes it wise borrowing.”

In January NYU is opening the NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering in downtown Brooklyn — one of the last major initiatives of Mr. Sexton’s presidency, which ends in 2016. The engineering school is NYU’s 14th school in total and will cost $40,000 per year.

Mr. Sexton has been criticized for devising potentially costly expansion plans while student debt surges, but he said an NYU education is a prudent investment.

“We provide the highest quality education we can, so when a student borrows to go to college, they’re getting as much value as they can. We prepare them for a joyful, useful, prosperous — however they define prosperous — life. If you borrow wisely, it’s okay. If you borrow $28,000 to buy two sports cars, that’s a different kind of borrowing. A college education will stay with you for life. A sports car will be worth half as much the minute you drive it into the streets.”

That said, “our single highest priority right now at NYU is raising money for financial aid,” Mr. Sexton said.

The university president said it is unlikely that NYU will open another school during his tenure. “My job now is to create an organic transition to the next team,” he said.

Asked who he thinks should or will succeed him, Mr. Sexton said he has “no idea at all,” but is “curious.”

He’ll find out “in due time,” he said.
