Scott Walker unveiled his proposal for Wisconsin\u2019s state budget on Tuesday night, and he did not shy away from offering bold ideas.\n\nThe second-term Republican governor has proposed a budget for 2015-17 that would cut property taxes again, eliminate the cap on the state\u2019s school choice program, and reform government by merging agencies.\n\nWalker\u2019s budget would also spin off the public University of Wisconsin System as a separate state entity and require those receiving government benefits to take a drug test.\n\n\u201cOur plan is based on growth and opportunity\u2014which leads to freedom and prosperity for all. Secondly, our plan will use common sense reforms to create a government that is limited in scope and\u2014ultimately\u2014more effective, more efficient, and more accountable to the public,\u201d Walker said. \u201cAnd finally, our plan will ensure a state where people are safe and sound in their homes and throughout their communities.\u201d\n\nWalker, regarded as a leading candidate for the GOP presidential nomination, continued to build on the policies passed in his first term, which included public-sector collective bargaining reforms, $2 billion in tax cuts and reforms to the state\u2019s entitlement programs.\n\nThe budget proposal, which will be heavily debated by state legislators in the coming months, would give homeowners additional property tax relief over the next two years.\n\n\u201cLargely because of our reforms and the flexibility we gave to local governments, property taxes on a typical home in Wisconsin are $131 less this year than they were in 2010,\u201d Walker said in his speech.\n\n\u201cTonight, I am proud to say that our state budget will continue those reforms, so the property tax bill on a typical home will be even lower during the next two years. Just as I promised, property taxes by the end of 2016 will be lower than they were in 2014.\u201d\n\nThis is in contrast to the $230 total increase in the four years before Walker took office.\n\nThe governor also talked about expanding the state\u2019s school choice program.\n\n\u201cI am excited to announce our plans to lift the cap on vouchers so more families \u2026 can have the choice to find the best school for their children,\u201d Walker said. \u201cEvery child deserves the chance to succeed.\u201d\n\nIf passed by the GOP-led legislature, all students living under 185 percent of the federal poverty level and currently attending a public school would have access to a voucher to attend a private school.\n\nThis expansion is on top of school choice programs already in place in the cities of Milwaukee and Racine.\n\nWalker\u2019s budget also expands public school choice in the form of independent charter schools. Wisconsin currently authorizes these schools in the city of Milwaukee, but nowhere else in the state. Independent charter schools are public schools, but do not operate under the auspice of the local school board or teachers\u2019 union.\n\nThe governor has proposed a statewide board, which would authorize new charter schools statewide. In Milwaukee, the independent charter schools have repeatedly outperformed their traditional public school peers.\n\nWalker\u2019s budget would also build on his past reforms of state government. The plan calls for the merger of multiple state departments\u2014including the Department of Financial Institutions, the Department of Safety and Professional Services, and the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation, among others\u2014into two, more efficient agencies.\n\nWalker also introduced a plan recently that would build on his previous entitlement reforms.\n\n\u201cOur budget expands the requirement for able-bodied adults to be enrolled in an employment and training program in order to receive food stamps,\u201d Walker announced. \u201cNow, some might claim that we\u2019re making it harder to get government assistance. We\u2019re not. We\u2019re making it easier to get a job.\u201d\n\nThe governor did not speak about the topics of right-to-work or eliminating the state\u2019s prevailing wage law\u2014both policies that are expected to be discussed this legislative session.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Gov.
