The friend pulled the trigger, thinking it wasn't loaded, according to the Flagler County Sheriff's Office.\n\nDeputies responded to a home on Parkview Drive in Palm Coast Tuesday afternoon to investigate a report of a shooting. They found Shane Huber, 18, conscious and alert with a single gunshot wound to the neck.\n\nHuber was flown to Halifax Medical Center in Daytona Beach. His condition was unknown.\n\nDetectives said Huber was showing his Romania .762x39mm AK-47 rifle to his 18-year-old friend, Brandon Williamson.\n\nHuber handed the rifle to Williamson. Williamson didn't believe the rifle was loaded and pulled the trigger, striking Huber, according to FCSO.\n\nDetectives believe the incident was accidental. No one else was in the home at the time.\n\nNo charges have been filed.\n\nCopyright 2015 by News4Jax.com. All rights reserved.
