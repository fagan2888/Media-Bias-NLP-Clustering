John Kasich speaks during a town hall meeting Oct. 5 at the University of Richmond in Richmond, Va. (Steve Helber/AP)\n\nRepublican presidential contender John Kasich vowed Monday to stick with his understated style even if it costs him the nomination \u2014 but also said he would think about whether he should \u201cjuice it up.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not playing to the cheap seats,\u201d he said at a town hall-style meeting at the University of Richmond. \u201cIf that\u2019s what it takes, I\u2019m not going to be president. I\u2019m not doing it. ... [But] I\u2019ll keep in mind what you\u2019re saying. Maybe there\u2019s a way at times to kind of juice it up and all that stuff.\u201d\n\nThe Ohio governor made the remark after a young man in the audience suggested that in an angst-ridden election season, Kasich had cast himself as a \u201chappy warrior\u201d \u2014 with too much emphasis on the \u201chappy.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere is the warrior most of the time?\u201d he asked Kasich.\n\nThe governor, running as a moderate, has struggled to get traction in a nomination contest that has been dominated by the swashbuckling Donald Trump. Even with support for the billionaire developer and reality television star falling, Trump still ranks first with nearly 23 percent in the latest Real Clear Politics average of the polls. Kasich is seventh, with just over 3 percent.\n\nKasich said that his style on the campaign trail should not be confused with a lack of resolve, pointing to his victories as governor and as a member of Congress before that. He called himself a \u201ctroublemaker,\u201d but one with a purpose. He said he so shook up Ohio government that his approval rating sank to the nation\u2019s lowest \u2014 before his reforms took hold and he won reelection in a rout.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t have any doubt about the fact that I have the spine and the toughness,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t balance the federal budget \u2014 make everybody in the town angry \u2014 you don\u2019t become the most unpopular governor in the country when you\u2019re turning a state around, unless you have the guts to do it. But I also know that tone matters.\u201d\n\n[Kasich has a novel pitch to voters: He\u2019s a politician]\n\nKasich, who spent 18 years in Congress then worked for Wall Street\u2019s Lehman Brothers before becoming governor, spent much of the hour-long meeting recounting his victories in state and federal budget-balancing, and defending his moderate stances on health care and immigration.\n\nHe played up his humble roots and youthful chutzpah. The son of a Pittsburgh-area postman and grandson of a coal miner, Kasich was an Ohio State freshman when he somehow finagled his way into a 20-minute Oval Office audience with President Richard M. Nixon.\n\nKasich also led the crowd in a chorus of \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d after a student said he\u2019d been given the chance to ask the first question because it was his big day. Serenade aside, student government President Angelo Suggs Jr. remained undecided, but said he liked Kasich\u2019s style.\n\n\u201cExecutive leadership might not always look like the hottest, most wild rhetoric,\u201d said Suggs, who had just turned 22.\n\nWhen a female student asked about immigration, Kasich said the country needs to secure its border just as her dorm\u2019s front door must be kept locked. But he also said that he supported a way for illegal immigrants to gain legal status.\n\n\u201cFor the ones that are here, if they didn\u2019t violate the law, they\u2019re part of our community, let them stay,\u201d he said.\n\nBut he said he does not favor making them full citizens over people who have been waiting their turns through legal channels.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t just say, \u2018Everything\u2019s okay,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t favor a path to citizenship. Give them the legalization. That\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\n\nKasich drew hundreds of people to the event, many of them students. Alice Reiniger, a homemaker who lives not far from the suburban campus, came to get a second look at the man she and her husband happened to meet in an elevator in New Hampshire in 1998, when Kasich was mulling an earlier bid for president.\n\n\u201cHe had a few moments to take a break and we sat together in the lobby for literally 10 minutes and just talked,\u201d she recalled. \u201cHe was so approachable, smart and confident, just an ease about him that he could handle whatever came his way.\u201d\n\nShe came away from the event \u201cvery encouraged.\u201d\n\nSome of Kasich\u2019s moderate policy stances put him out of step with Republican leaders in Virginia. Under Kasich, Ohio agreed to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, something Virginia\u2019s Republican-led General Assembly has repeatedly rejected. He has defended that decision as both compassionate and financially sound, saying that the health-care program for the poor will keep people from using the emergency room for routine medical care.\n\nJust three Republicans in the Virginia Senate have supported a form of Medicaid expansion. One of them, Sen. Emmett Hanger of Augusta, will serve as Virginia co-chairman of Kasich\u2019s campaign in the state, along with Dels. Chris Peace (R-Hanover) and Ron Villanueva (R-Virginia Beach). Former congressman Tom Davis, one of the state\u2019s most prominent moderate Republicans, will serve as honorary state chairman.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Republican presidential hopeful, insisting that \u201ctone matters,\u201d says he will never play to the \u2018\u201dcheap seats.\u201d", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/laura.vozzella", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The Republican presidential hopeful, insisting that \u201ctone matters,\u201d says he will never play to the \u2018\u201dcheap seats.\u201d", "title": "Understated Kasich says he\u2019ll think about the possible need to \u2018juice it up\u2019", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/understated-kasich-says-hell-think-about-the-possible-need-to-juice-it-up/2015/10/05/25da4a52-6b75-11e5-9bfe-e59f5e244f92_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/10/05/Local-Politics/Images/GOP_2016_Kasich-0cbb6-621.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@LVozzella"}, "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "va politics, virginia politics, ppinclude, kasich, kasich richmond, kasich juice it up, donald trump, university of Richmond,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/laura.vozzella"}, "eomportal-uuid": "25da4a52-6b75-11e5-9bfe-e59f5e244f92", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "va politics, virginia politics, ppinclude, kasich, kasich richmond, kasich juice it up, donald trump, university of Richmond,"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd84c7\"", "article_summary": "Under Kasich, Ohio agreed to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, something Virginia\u2019s Republican-led General Assembly has repeatedly rejected.\nFormer congressman Tom Davis, one of the state\u2019s most prominent moderate Republicans, will serve as honorary state chairman.\nThe governor, running as a moderate, has struggled to get traction in a nomination contest that has been dominated by the swashbuckling Donald Trump.\nOne of them, Sen.
