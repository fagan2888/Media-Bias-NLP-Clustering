The gloves, tied to a street sign on Commerce in Deep Ellum, caught our attention first; then, the note tied to the wool knitted handwear.

“I AM NOT LOST!” said the note. “If you are stuck out in the cold, please take this to stay warm.”

Earlier this year, ABC News and Huffington Post noted that groups all over the country started leaving gloves, scarves and hats for strangers — mostly, the homeless. It began in Easton, Pennsylvania, ABC reported, with a Facebook-organized group called Chase the Chill, which has spread across Canada and the U.S. It dates back to 2008.

Chase the Chill says it’s “an annual graffiti/yarn bombing event that distributes scarves in public places so that those in need — regardless of income and without any qualifiers — can help themselves.”

Wilmington, North Carolina, has a similar organization: Scarves in the Port City, which has garnered national attention by doing what someone did in Deep Ellum. Says its Facebook page, “We collect and distribute scarves for the homeless during inclement weather. Our mission is to promote kindness and service in our community.”

It’s not clear — yet — who’s doing the good deed in Dallas. A colleague believes it might be the Dallas Yarn Bombers, which did something similar with scarves conjunction with Warm Up America in February. We’ve asked. [Update: And they say no, via Facebook, adding that “we’re planning a ‘secret’ for Valentine’s Day.”] Another friend says it’s a group called Sharing the Warmth.

Regardless, it’s beginning to feel a lot like Christmas.
