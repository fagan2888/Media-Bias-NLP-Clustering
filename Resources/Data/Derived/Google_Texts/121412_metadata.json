It\u2019s because of homosexuality and same-sex marriage. It\u2019s because of abortion \u2014 or, more specifically, from the deep-blue state\u2019s failure to enact enough draconian antiabortion laws, according to Republican state lawmaker Shannon Grove.\n\nAt a recent California ProLife Council event honoring the state\u2019s few anti-choice legislators, Assemblywoman Grove approached the pulpit podium with her bible in tow, which she reportedly held above her head before she began her pronouncements. \u201cThis is the infallible word of God,\u201d Grove said. \u201cI fear Him more than I fear anyone.\u201d\n\n\n\nAccording to RH Reality Check, Grove then went on to offer her very logical explanation for California\u2019s extreme water crisis:\n\n\u201cTexas was in a long period of drought until Governor Perry signed the fetal pain bill,\u201d she told the audience, presumably referring to HB 2, the omnibus Texas abortion bill that included a 20-week ban based on junk science. \u201cIt rained that night. Now God has His hold on California.\u201d\n\nIt is indeed true that since Perry signed the extraordinarily restrictive antiabortion law \u2014 the enforcement of which has left fewer than a dozen clinics open in the massive state \u2014 Texas has seen the end of its drought. And it would seem, to use Grove\u2019s logic, that The Lord celebrated by sending some epic floods to parts of the state and killing more than 30 people a mere two years after HB 2 was first enacted. (Perhaps God was just waiting to make sure the Fifth Circuit held up its end of the deal.)\n\nAs Salon\u2019s resident writers on feminist issues and sustainability, however, we are skeptical of Grove\u2019s logic. We know that abortion can allow women to have more opportunities in the workforce and greater economic success, as well as basic reproductive and bodily autonomy, but there\u2019s not a ton of research about the whole drought thing. We also know antiabortion laws are associated with increased rates of poverty, maternal and infant mortality, and generally worse health outcomes for women and children. Oh, and there\u2019s no clear correlation between abortion restrictions and precipitation\u2026yet.", "article_metadata": {"description": "State Assemblywoman Shannon Grove thinks God is smiting states with pro-choice laws.
