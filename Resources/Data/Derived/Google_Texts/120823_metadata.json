They cranked out 16 hits, including two-run homers by Corey Dickerson and Nolan Arenado.\n\n\u201cOur confidence is out the roof, for sure,\u201d said Dickerson, who drove in four runs. \u201cI think other teams see this lineup and know it\u2019s dangerous. We are a confident team.\u201d\n\nWATCH: Woody Paige, Les Shapiro pick the best six players in Major League Baseball\n\nHow good a day was it for the Rockies? According to Milwaukee catcher Jonathan Lucroy, Dickerson broke his bat on his line-drive home run. Dickerson claimed otherwise, but the raw power he displayed was symbolic of the Rockies\u2019 onslaught.\n\nFor a team that limped to a 21-60 road record last season, Monday\u2019s romp was a welcome changeup. Colorado scored 10 runs or more in a road game just twice last season. Monday\u2019s game produced the most runs the Rockies have ever scored in an opening-day road game.\n\nKendrick, the Rockies\u2019 new $5.5 million right-hander, not only pitched seven shutout innings, he went 2-for-4 with a double and scored a run. He mixed and matched his pitches masterfully, relying primarily on sinkers and changeups thrown over the inside corner.\n\n\u201cThis was great, but I just came in here thinking I\u2019d do what I did in (Philadelphia), and that\u2019s give my team a chance to win,\u201d said Kendrick, who credited catcher Nick Hundley for devising the game plan that kept Milwaukee hitters off balance. \u201cYou don\u2019t really think about the results, you just go out and execute pitches. Today it really worked out.\u201d\n\nRafael Betancourt and Christian Friedrich each pitched a scoreless inning of relief to preserve just the second shutout on opening day in Rockies history. The other came against the Cardinals in 2001 at Coors Field.\n\nWATCH: Metal detectors are coming to Coors Field as Rockies step up security\n\nKendrick escaped one jam, in the second inning when Milwaukee trailed 4-0 but loaded the bases with one out. Kendrick, whom Rockies manager Walt Weiss refers to as a surgeon, threw an 82 mph changeup to Jean Segura, who grounded into a 5-4-3 double play to end the inning.\n\n\u201cHe got some traffic in that second inning, but he didn\u2019t get rattled,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cHe made a pitch to get the double play. That was real big \u2014 to keep the momentum on our side.\u201d\n\nThe Rockies blew the game open 10-0 by the fourth inning, prompting Milwaukee fans to start chanting \u201cLet\u2019s Go Badgers!\u201d in anticipation of Monday night\u2019s NCAA championship basketball game in Indianapolis between Wisconsin and Duke. A big chunk of the announced crowd of 46,032 at Miller Park had left by the seventh-inning stretch.\n\nPHOTOS: Rockies vs. Brewrs, 2015 season opener\n\nColorado players boasted all spring that their lineup could mash with anybody. They didn\u2019t wait to tattoo Brewers right-hander Kyle Lohse, scoring four runs on four hits in the first inning. Back-to-back doubles from Carlos Gonzalez and Troy Tulowitzki produced the first run, and a double by Arenado drove in Tulo. Up to the plate stepped Dickerson, who lined Lohse\u2019s 1-2 fastball into the right-field seats for a 4-0 lead.\n\nLohse was gone by the fourth inning, having allowed a career- worst eight earned runs.\n\nThe Rockies hope they have started something big.\n\nPatrick Saunders: psaunders@denverpost.com or twitter.com/psaundersdp\n\nGrand opening act\n\nThe Rockies rolled to a 10-0 opening-day victory. Some highlights:\n\n\u2022 It was the second opening-day shutout in Rockies history, and their first on the road.\n\n\u2022 Starter Kyle Kendrick threw a first-pitch strike to 18 of the 27 batters he faced.\n\n\u2022 Third baseman Nolan Arenado had three hits and four RBIs, matching career highs.\n\n\u2022 Left fielder Corey Dickerson hit a home run and a double and matched his career high with four RBIs.\n\n\u2022 The Rockies\u2019 16 hits matched their most ever at Milwaukee.\n\nPatrick Saunders, The Denver Post\n\nLooking ahead\n\n\n\nRockies\u2019 Jordan Lyles (7-4, 4.33 ERA in 2014) vs. Brewers\u2019 Matt Garza (8-8, 3.64), 6:10 p.m. Tuesday, ROOT; 850 AM\n\nLyles didn\u2019t expect to be in the Rockies\u2019 starting rotation at the beginning of last season. He got his position because Tyler Chatwood pulled a hamstring late in spring training. But Lyles is in the rotation now, armed with a better changeup, a better curveball and more confidence. The right- hander is 2-3 with a 3.64 ERA in six games (one start) vs. Milwaukee, all while playing with Houston from 2011-13. He is 1-2 with a 4.05 ERA in three games (one start) at Miller Park. Garza is 2-3 with a 4.94 ERA in five starts vs. the Rockies.\n\nWednesday: Rockies\u2019 Eddie Butler (1-1, 6.75 ERA in 2014) vs. Brewers\u2019 Wily Peralta (17-11, 3.54), 6:10 p.m., ROOT\n\nThursday: Off\n\nFriday: Cubs\u2019 Travis Wood (9-13, 5.03) vs. Rockies\u2019 Tyler Matzek (6-11, 4.05), 2:10 p.m., ROOT\n\nPatrick Saunders, The Denver Post", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Rockies rout Brewers 10-0 in 2015 season opener in Milwaukee", "title": "Rockies rout Brewers 10-0 in 2015 season opener in Milwaukee", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/04/06/rockies-rout-brewers-10-0-in-2015-season-opener-in-milwaukee/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150406__dickersonp1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150406__dickersonp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-06T15:31:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-25T00:17:45+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe24b0\"", "article_summary": "PHOTOS: Rockies vs. Brewrs, 2015 season openerColorado players boasted all spring that their lineup could mash with anybody.\nThe right- hander is 2-3 with a 3.64 ERA in six games (one start) vs. Milwaukee, all while playing with Houston from 2011-13.\nWednesday: Rockies\u2019 Eddie Butler (1-1, 6.75 ERA in 2014) vs. Brewers\u2019 Wily Peralta (17-11, 3.54), 6:10 p.m., ROOTThursday: OffFriday: Cubs\u2019 Travis Wood (9-13, 5.03) vs. Rockies\u2019 Tyler Matzek (6-11, 4.05), 2:10 p.m., ROOTPatrick Saunders, The Denver Post\nThe Rockies pounded the Milwaukee Brewers 10-0 at Miller Park, getting seven shutout innings from newcomer Kyle Kendrick in the most impressive opening-day victory in club history.\nSome highlights:\u2022 It was the second opening-day shutout in Rockies history, and their first on the road."}
