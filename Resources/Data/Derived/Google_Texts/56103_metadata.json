How long is this going to continue?\n\nCable chatter, talking heads with little to talk about, Republican orchestrated guests with (surprise!) more Obama attacks, facts be damned.\n\nIt reminds me of the disappearance of former congressional intern Chandra Levy, where the cable guys couldn\u2019t get enough but didn\u2019t know enough, or the recent 24/7 coverage of a lost airliner where all the reporting was that there was nothing to report.\n\n\n\n[GALLERY: Cartoons on Afghanistan]\n\nRepublicans called for action to get Bergdahl released and criticized Obama for not doing enough, then, when he was released, condemned the release. Here are some examples:\n\n\n\nSarah Palin before: \u201cTodd and I are praying for Private First Class Bowe Bergdahl, his family, and all of his fellow soldiers who are putting their lives on the line to defend our freedom and protect democracy abroad,\u201d\n\nSarah Palin after the release: \u201cNo, Mr. President, a soldier expressing horrid anti-American beliefs \u2013 even boldly putting them in writing and unabashedly firing off his messages while in uniform, just three days before he left his unit on foot \u2013 is not 'honorable service.' Unless that is your standard.\u201d\n\nFormer Rep. Alan West, R-Fla., before: \u201cThen there is Army SGT Bowe Bergdahl still held by the Islamic terrorist Haqqani network, probably in Pakistan, in the same place where Osama Bin Laden was hiding. This past POW/MIA national day of recognition, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel reiterated a pledge to secure the young Army NCO being held captive, but have there been any actions? Any time, attention, or even mention from the Commander-in-Chief? Nah, no camera highlights in it for him.\u201d\n\nAlan West after the release: \u201cLadies and gentlemen, I submit that Barack Hussein Obama\u2019s unilateral negotiations with terrorists and the ensuing release of their key leadership without consult \u2014 mandated by law \u2014 with the U.S. Congress represents high crimes and misdemeanors, an impeachable offense.\u201d\n\nThere are plenty more examples of the before/after effect from Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., and James Inhofe, R-Okla., to name a few.\n\n[SEE: Cartoons about the Republican Party]\n\nSome Republicans put up tweets of praise, then withdrew them, but Rep. Lee Terry, R-Neb., takes the cake with this statement which was later deleted from his website:\n\n\n\n\"A grateful nation welcomes the news of the return of Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl. I have the pleasure of regularly speaking with our nation's active duty military and veterans and I know that there is nothing more solemn than the pledge to never leave one of their own behind on the field of battle.\n\n\"Sgt. Bergdahl is a national hero. It's my hope that once he ultimately retires from active duty service, implementation of reforms to our nation's VA hospitals are made so that he will have access to the long-term care he has rightfully earned from the horrors he endured.\"\n\n", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "title": "Republicans Couldn't Wait for the Facts of Bowe Bergdahl Taliban Swap", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Republicans couldn't wait to go on the attack after Bowe Bergdahl's release.", "title": "Attack First, Get the Facts Never", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/peter-fenn/2014/06/05/republicans-couldnt-wait-for-the-facts-of-bowe-bergdahl-taliban-swap", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/5c/bb/e77046274159bb7a1e4af06943ab/20140603edloc-a.tif", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Republicans Couldn't Wait for the Facts of Bowe Bergdahl Taliban Swap", "description": "Republicans couldn't wait to go on the attack after Bowe Bergdahl's release.", "card": "summary", "site": "@USNews"}, "site": "opinion", "date_published": "June 5, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Peter Fenn,War in Afghanistan (2001-2014),Afghanistan,POWs,Obama administration,McCain, John,West, Allen,Palin, Sarah,Taliban,Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Republicans couldn't wait to go on the attack after Bowe Bergdahl's release."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb56a\"", "article_summary": "Bowe Bergdahl.\n[GALLERY: Cartoons on Afghanistan]Republicans called for action to get Bergdahl released and criticized Obama for not doing enough, then, when he was released, condemned the release.\nUnless that is your standard.\u201dFormer Rep.
