Adkins Memorial Instructor of the Year Award.\n\n\u201cI am honored to receive this recognition,\u201d Jumper said. \u201cI enjoy teaching welding and helping students develop their skills in the trade. Welding is a skill that cannot be outsourced and there will always be a need for welders.\u201d\n\nThe AWS was founded in 1919, and is a nonprofit organization with a global mission to advance the science, technology and application of welding and allied joining and cutting processes, including brazing, soldering and thermal spraying.\n\nThe organization serves more than 70,000 members working in all areas \u2014 from individual welders to engineers, manufacturers, educators and more. It is the source for qualification and certification of welding personnel and offers international, national and local educational opportunities including seminars, conferences, individual corporate programs and online courses.\n\nJumper, of Bethalto, joined LCCC in April 2012 and began developing the welding program curriculum. The program was opened and filled with students by the second eight-week session of the fall semester that same year.\n\nSince then, the demand for jobs in welding has grown, as has the demand for spots in the program. More than 50 students have completed the program at LCCC.\n\nJumper said he has been a longtime advocate of vocational and career programs in education.\n\n\u201cFor as long as I can remember I have always enjoyed building things,\u201d Jumper said. \u201cWhen I was in high school, I had a conversation with my assistant principal and football coach about how difficult it was to find qualified high school vocational instructors. That was when I decided I would go to school and become a vocational educator.\u201d\n\nEverything has come full circle for Jumper, who says his teaching style is more like a coach.\n\n\u201cI enjoy working with my students and as they successfully complete our welding program and go on to work in the field to build a better life for themselves and their families,\u201d he said. \u201cI try to be a coach and a mentor to my students. Students learn by doing, and that is how I teach. I am there to show and explain how welding works, and then I let the student work toward mastering the skillset as I coach them.\u201d\n\nSue Czerwinski, dean of career programs at LCCC, said Jumper is well deserving of this award.\n\n\u201cTravis is a great teacher, coordinator and mentor,\u201d she said. \u201cHe has poured his heart and soul into the college\u2019s welding program, and you can tell when you talk to his students that he inspires them to be the best they can be.\u201d\n\nJumper said he has big plans for the future of the program.\n\n\u201cI would like to make the Welding Technology program at Lewis and Clark one of the elite programs in the country,\u201d Jumper said. \u201cI want members of the AWS all over America to know the name and great reputation of Lewis and Clark Community College and our students.\u201d\n\nFor more information on the Welding Technology program, visit www.lc.edu/program/welding/ or call (618) 468-4931.\n\nFor general enrollment information, visit www.lc.edu today, or call (618) 468-2222 or (800) YES-LCCC.\n\nArticle supplied by Lewis and Clark Community College.\n\nStaff report\n\nTravis Jumper, assistant professor and coordinator of Lewis and Clark Community College\u2019s Welding program, right, instructs welding student Richard Frank, of Moro.
