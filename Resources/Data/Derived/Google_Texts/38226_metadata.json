The 51,500-square-foot facility at 4130 and 4150 Lenoir St. will displace residents living at Ed\u2019s and Sunset Hills mobile home parks.\n\nThe application identifies a geographic region that excludes the population of Columbia and shows the planned Fulton Medical Center as the only hospital in the region, although five other hospitals are within four miles driving distance from the site.\n\nSinek has said the region determined by the application was \u201cgerrymandering\u201d and \u201can attempt to create a false impression that there\u2019s a large population base that\u2019s not being served.\u201d\n\nThe certificate-of-need application says there would be \u201cno impact\u201d for hospitals closest to the proposed hospital\u2019s service area.\n\nSinek said the wording of the petition will be finalized this week. He said hospital officials also plan to request a public meeting in Columbia with the health facilities review committee before the July 13 hearing in Jefferson City.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a prelude to the official certificate-of-need hearing,\u201d he said. Sinek said supporters and opponents would have a chance to speak at the local meeting.\n\nAmy Leiker, vice president of global marketing for Leawood, Kan.-based Nueterra, said in an email that demographics and demand trends are always considered when building a new hospital.\n\n\u201cThe expansion of Fulton Medical Center will provide residents in Mid-Missouri with another option for healthcare close to home,\u201d she said. Leiker has declined to answer additional questions. Questions to MU Health officials are repeatedly referred to Nueterra.\n\nMonday\u2019s Boone Hospital Board of Trustees meeting also included an update from BJC HealthCare CEO Steve Lipstein about the health system\u2019s growing footprint in the St. Louis region and beyond. BJC operates Boone Hospital through a lease agreement with the Boone County commission.\n\nBJC\u2019s system now includes 14 hospitals after the purchase of Mineral Area Regional Medical Center in Farmington and a partnership with Memorial Hospital of Belleville, Ill.\n\nBJC HealthCare also has taken over operations and ownership of the St. Louis Regional Psychiatric Stabilization Center, a 25-bed adult inpatient acute psychiatric program in St. Louis.\n\nLipstein said BJC is strengthening its collaborations with other health systems at a time when University of Missouri Health Care is joining a new collaborative with the Mercy and Mosaic health systems. Lipstein said MU Health is also working to form partnerships with hospitals in Hannibal and Lake of the Ozarks.\n\n\u201cI think we can expect more collaborations,\u201d he said. As a result of the state legislature not expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, some 700,000 Missourians are still without health insurance, he said.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;polling-uri=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=1;polling-uri2=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=2;polling-uri3=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=3;polling-uri4=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=4;polling-uri5=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=5; cycle=1", "googlebot": "noarchive", "application-name": "Columbia Tribune", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/columbiatribune.com/content/tncms/live/global/resources/images/_site/windows8_favs/wide.png?_dc=1372340732", "twitter": {"description": "Boone Hospital Center is working out details of a petition opposing an effort by Nueterra and the University of Missouri Health System to build Columbia\u2019s sixth hospital.", "creator": "@JJacksonJr", "site": "@columbiatribune", "card": "summary", "title": "Boone Hospital plans petition opposing application for new hospital"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#065874", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/columbiatribune.com/content/tncms/live/global/resources/images/_site/windows8_favs/tiny.png?_dc=1372340614", "og": {"url": "http://www.columbiatribune.com/news/local/boone-hospital-plans-petition-opposing-application-for-new-hospital/article_6d9d8a88-ba15-5408-a295-0a560a14d27b.html", "type": "article", "site_name": "Columbia Daily Tribune", "description": "Boone Hospital Center is working out details of a petition opposing an effort by Nueterra and the University of Missouri Health System to build Columbia\u2019s sixth hospital.", "title": "Boone Hospital plans petition opposing application for new hospital"}, "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/columbiatribune.com/content/tncms/live/global/resources/images/_site/windows8_favs/large.png?_dc=1372340596", "p": {"domain_verify": "e84f2ccdbb23b2303cfa08c12e9bd926"}, "fb": {"app_id": 299470460147166}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/columbiatribune.com/content/tncms/live/global/resources/images/_site/windows8_favs/t-badge_144.png?_dc=1372343381", "keywords": "social issues,nueterra,fulton medical center,jim sinek,boone hospital center,university of missouri health care,steve lipstein,jefferson city,amy leiker,university of missouri health system,missouri health facilities review", "msvalidate.01": "1E3A617C7822235CF7453A03AC560148", "google-site-verification": "Pa-FtOcowtRH8XQjoX9dIrD_ncPLS80pMIWeoJZyZnA", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/columbiatribune.com/content/tncms/live/global/resources/images/_site/windows8_favs/square.png?_dc=1372340606", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes", "description": "Boone Hospital Center is working out details of a petition opposing an effort by Nueterra and the University of Missouri Health System to build Columbia\u2019s sixth hospital."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda5cd\"", "article_summary": "Boone Hospital Center is working out details of a petition opposing an effort by Nueterra and the University of Missouri Health System to build Columbia\u2019s sixth hospital.\nBJC operates Boone Hospital through a lease agreement with the Boone County commission.\n\u201cThe expansion of Fulton Medical Center will provide residents in Mid-Missouri with another option for healthcare close to home,\u201d she said.\nBoone Hospital President Jim Sinek told the hospital board of trustees Monday that a Boone Hospital Foundation board member has volunteered to coordinate the petition drive targeting a certificate-of-need application filed by Fulton Medical Center, the new name of the Fulton hospital co-owned since December by the Nueterra/MU Health partnership.\nMonday\u2019s Boone Hospital Board of Trustees meeting also included an update from BJC HealthCare CEO Steve Lipstein about the health system\u2019s growing footprint in the St. Louis region and beyond."}
