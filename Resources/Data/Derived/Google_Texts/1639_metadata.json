Both fires have been contained due to available resources and immediate response by firefighters.\n\nAvailable resources, location of the fire, and vegetation conditions make the difference in the ability of fire managers to suppress fires quickly. The U.S. Forest Service Northern Colorado helicopter that supported the Spruce Fire was just flying out of the park after completing their last sling load mission bringing supplies out, when firefighters at Upper Beaver Meadows reported smoke and trees burning on Beaver Mountain. Advertisement\n\nRocky Mountain National Park's engine plus two squads of firefighters quickly responded. The Alpine Hotshots, who are based at Rocky and were just returning from an assignment at Grand Canyon National Park, also sent a squad to each fire. Fire managers were able to use water bucket drops from the helicopter with critical ground crews to contain both fires quickly. Vegetation conditions were dry enough to allow for a relatively rapid initial establishment of the lighting-caused fires but wet enough to slow its spread.\n\nThe fire on Eagle Cliff was very small with one single tree burning and some ground fire. The fire on Beaver Mountain was contained at roughly 1/4 acre and was actively burning in pine needle litter and downed logs. Both locations were in steep terrain and firefighters reached both areas in less than an hour.\n\nEstes Valley Fire Protection District provided critical support during the early development of these two fires, as contingency, should another fire be discovered or structures threatened.\n\nIt is unusual to have two simultaneous lightning-caused fires at Rocky Mountain National Park. Fortunately resources were immediately available to respond.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.eptrail.com/rocky-mountain-national-park/ci_26089287/two-lightning-fires-contained-rocky-mountain-national-park", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site28/2014/0704/20140704_095240_09epFire on Beaver Mountain July 3, 2014 (2)_300.jpg", "endDate": "2024-07-04T09:44:48-0600", "description": "Lightning in Rocky Mountain National Park Thursday afternoon caused two separate small fires, one on Eagle Cliff and one on Beaver Mountain.", "ag": {"canon": "EstesParkTrail-Gazette:article:26089287:view"}, "startDate": "2014-07-04T09:44:48-0600", "og": {"url": "http://www.eptrail.com/rocky-mountain-national-park/ci_26089287/two-lightning-fires-contained-rocky-mountain-national-park", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site28/2014/0704/20140704_095240_09epFire on Beaver Mountain July 3, 2014 (2).jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Lightning in Rocky Mountain National Park Thursday afternoon caused two separate small fires, one on Eagle Cliff and one on Beaver Mountain.", "title": "Two lightning fires contained in Rocky Mountain National Park"}, "twitter": {"domain": "eptrail.com", "description": "Lightning in Rocky Mountain National Park Thursday afternoon caused two separate small fires, one on Eagle Cliff and one on Beaver Mountain.", "title": "Two lightning fires contained in Rocky Mountain National Park", "url": "http://www.eptrail.com/rocky-mountain-national-park/ci_26089287/two-lightning-fires-contained-rocky-mountain-national-park", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site28/2014/0704/20140704_095240_09epFire on Beaver Mountain July 3, 2014 (2).jpg", "site": "@eptrailgazette", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-07-04T09:44:48-0600", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "sailthru.title": "Two lightning fires contained in Rocky Mountain National Park", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site28/2014/0704/20140704_095240_09epFire on Beaver Mountain July 3, 2014 (2).jpg", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Estes Park News", "modificationDate": "2014-07-04T09:52:58-0600", "google-site-verification": "KkJ2C-PvexXpGs0YrC0OaC569g0Ty1BcleONkROSkmQ", "sailthru.site": "eptrail.com", "pubDate": "2014-07-04T09:54:27-0600", "news_keywords": "Rocky Mountain National Park, Rocky Mountain National Park news, Estes Park Colorado Rocky Mountain National Park news, Estes Park Colorado news, Rocky Mountain National Park Estes Park news, Rocky Mountain National Park Colorado news, US Rocky Mountain National Park news, world Rocky Mountain National Park news"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0117\"", "article_summary": "Lightning in Rocky Mountain National Park Thursday afternoon caused two separate small fires, one on Eagle Cliff and one on Beaver Mountain.\nIt is unusual to have two simultaneous lightning-caused fires at Rocky Mountain National Park.\nFire managers were able to use water bucket drops from the helicopter with critical ground crews to contain both fires quickly.\nAdvertisementRocky Mountain National Park's engine plus two squads of firefighters quickly responded.\nThe fire on Beaver Mountain was contained at roughly 1/4 acre and was actively burning in pine needle litter and downed logs."}
