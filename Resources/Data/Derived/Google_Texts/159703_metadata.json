It set caps on the number of soldiers, tanks, artillery pieces and other non-nuclear military assets that could be stationed in Europe.\n\nRelated: Spooked by Putin, EU Brass Consider a European Army\n\nState-run media reported that the decision to \u201cwithdraw completely\u201d from the treaty was announced by Anton Mazur, head of the Russian delegation arms control talks in Vienna.\n\nRussia\u2019s withdrawal decision is very nearly a formality. Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2007 suspended Russia\u2019s observation of the treaty after the other signatories would not agree to changes, in the form of an \u201cadapted\u201d treaty. Russia had felt those changes were necessary because of a realignment of global power away from Russia after the Cold War.\n\n\u201cFor years, the Russian side has been doing its best to maintain viability of the regime of control over conventional arms, it initiated talks on adapting the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe, it ratified the agreement on Adapted CFE Treaty,\u201d Mazur said, according to the Kremlin-owned news service ITAR-TASS. \u201cRegrettably, NATO countries have preferred to dodge CFE provisions by means of the alliance\u2019s expansion and use any pretexts to prevent the Agreement on Adapted CFE Treaty from coming into effect. This course pursued despite our repeated warning about its harmful impacts on the regime of control over conventional weapons led to the unavoidable result \u2014 Russia\u2019s suspending the CFE Treaty in 2007.\u201d\n\nRussia had continued to participate in \u201cconsultative\u201d meetings with the signatories. However, Mazur said the Kremlin now sees further participation as \u201cpointless from both political and practical points of view and as excessively costly from the financial and economic point of view.\u201d\n\nRelated: Putin\u2019s Dead Soldiers Are Evidence of His Deceit\n\nMazur added, \u201cThis step does not mean that Russia rejects further dialogue on control over conventional arms in Europe if and when our partners are ripe for that. We are still ready for joint work on a new regime of control over conventional arms in Europe, which is in the interests of both Russia and other European states.\u201d\n\nThe announcement comes just days after European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker called for creating a single army to represent the entire European Union, citing ongoing Russian aggression in Ukraine as a primary reason.\n\n\u201cA common European army would convey a clear message to Russia that we are serious about defending our European values,\u201d Juncker said.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Russia on Tuesday announced that it would completely withdraw from all participation in a treaty drawn up at the end of the Cold War that was meant to limit the size of ground forces in Europe.", "title": "Putin Pulls Out of Post-Cold War Arms Treaty", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/10/Putin-Pulls-Out-Post-Cold-War-Arms-Treaty", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/07212014_Putin_European_Union.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/10/Putin-Pulls-Out-Post-Cold-War-Arms-Treaty", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/07212014_Putin_European_Union.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Russia on Tuesday announced that it would completely withdraw from all participation in a treaty drawn up at the end of the Cold War that was meant to limit the size of ground forces in Europe.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "\u201cRegrettably, NATO countries have preferred to dodge CFE provisions by means of the alliance\u2019s expansion and use any pretexts to prevent the Agreement on Adapted CFE Treaty from coming into effect.\nThe Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe was an agreement signed in 1990 between the 16 North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries and six Warsaw Pact countries.\nRelated: Spooked by Putin, EU Brass Consider a European ArmyState-run media reported that the decision to \u201cwithdraw completely\u201d from the treaty was announced by Anton Mazur, head of the Russian delegation arms control talks in Vienna.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin in 2007 suspended Russia\u2019s observation of the treaty after the other signatories would not agree to changes, in the form of an \u201cadapted\u201d treaty.\nRussia had felt those changes were necessary because of a realignment of global power away from Russia after the Cold War."}
