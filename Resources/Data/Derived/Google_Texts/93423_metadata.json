He would use these weapons to kill 14 people and wound 32 others in an attack from the university\u2019s tower in 1966.\n\nFast forward to another mass murder committed by a student, this time at Virginia Polytechnic Institute in 2007. Although he had been diagnosed with such severe mental problems that a court had ordered him to undergo psychiatric treatment, Seung-Hui Cho had no difficulty buying semi-automatic guns. Comparing himself to Jesus, he took these weapons to campus, where he killed 32 people and wounded 17 others before committing suicide.\n\nAlthough the Aurora, Colorado, massacre in 2012 may have taken place in a movie theater off-campus, it is probably no coincidence that the gunman, James Holmes, was a 24-year-old graduate student at the University of Colorado. Even though he had admitted fantasies about mass murder to a school psychiatrist, he was able to buy semi-automatic rifles legally at sporting goods stores and purchase 6,000 rounds of ammunition online. Holmes\u2019 attorneys acknowledged that he was \u201cin the throes of a psychotic episode\u201d during the bloodbath.\n\nLess spectacular deadly shootings are increasingly common on American campuses. And we have all encountered our share of scary students. But perhaps we should not be surprised. The age of the college population, the campus environment and lifestyle, and the easy access to guns all come together to create the perfect storm.\n\nThe age of onset of some severe psychiatric conditions is adolescence and early adulthood \u2014 the years typically spent at college. This is confirmed by the latest edition of The American Psychiatric Association\u2019s \u201cDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\u201d (the DSM-5), the authoritative source for psychiatric diagnoses in the U.S. According to the DSM-5, especially for males, the psychotic features of schizophrenia start emerging in the late teens. The peak age of the onset of initial full-blown psychotic episodes, which may include hallucinations, delusions, incoherence and chaotic behavior, is the early to mid-twenties.\n\nBipolar disorder also typically emerges between the mid-teens and mid-twenties. Not the ideal time for those who are most vulnerable to leave the support of family, friends and community to go to college.\n\nDrugs, sex and rock \u2018n\u2019 roll don\u2019t help much either. University life may be especially conducive to mental illness since heavy drinking and partying, along with drugs, promiscuity and sleep deprivation, are common.\n\nThe turbulent behavior of some college students, which may be symptomatic of severe psychiatric disorders, is accepted \u2014 if not expected and encouraged \u2014 in permissive academic culture. In the \u201creal world\u201d and in the workplace, this conduct would be more readily recognized for what it is. And it would never be tolerated.\n\nPressure to do well academically and to fit in socially may also \u201ctrigger\u201d mental illness for the vulnerable. And \u201ctrigger\u201d is surely the appropriate word, given Americans\u2019 easy access to guns. Supported by the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution, which protects the right of individuals \u201cto keep and bear arms,\u201d our gun culture contributes to the body count. Countries with restrictive access to guns experience fewer incidents of campus violence.\n\nOf course, colleges and universities are not the only American settings conducive to mass shootings. So many post office workers have killed their managers and fellow employees that \u201cgoing postal\u201d has become slang for flipping out. Perhaps we should coin another phrase for American campuses: \u201cgoing academic.\u201d\n\nHoward P. Segal is professor of history at the University of Maine. Deborah D.
