Aberdeen, SD

Northern State University has boosted Internet speeds in recent years, with students coming to campus with more devices that demand more bandwidth.



Jodi Casanova is the school's information technology security officer. She says Internet speeds have increased more than tenfold since 2011. The most popular sites visited by students in the first week of school were Netflix and YouTube, both heavy users of Internet bandwidth.



Casanova tells the Aberdeen American News that most of the school's bandwidth goes to students. She says applications they use are more intensive, but that campus is their home and they should have the chance to relax.



Casanova says the school has set up a system so that shows and movies watched on streaming sites are stored on a server, freeing up bandwidth.
