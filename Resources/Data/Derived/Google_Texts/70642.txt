A home in north Wichita has been the buzz of the neighborhood, literally. Nested inside the soon-to-be renovated building were 50,000 bees.

Wes Wolken is a professional bee keeper, his job was to remove them all. "[The homeowner] discovered that a large hive of bees was under the home," Wolken said, "so I came out and inspected and confirmed the fact that there was a large hive of bees."

Wolken spent most of the afternoon Sunday removing the bees, in the process, finding a network of honeycomb that extended 18 feet long and almost 50 pounds of honey.

After scooping out some of the honeycomb, Wolken powered up a special vacuum and started to remove the bees individually by sucking them into a special canister.

The bees will be relocated to an arboretum where they will stay until they are healthy enough to be placed in a new, permanent location.

Wes Wolken holds a class every year to train people on bee keeping. Anyone interested in taking this class should contact the Wichita Parks and Recreation department.
