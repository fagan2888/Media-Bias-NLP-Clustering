He scored a dazzling goal Thursday to help the Blackhawks beat the Calgary Flames and has maintained close to a point-per-game average.\n\nBackground: A native of Buffalo, N.Y., Kane was the No. 1 pick in the 2007 NHL draft and has helped Chicago win two Stanley Cups. He scored the overtime goal that gave Chicago the Cup in 2009. He is a colorful player and personality, and has cleaned up his reputation since some off-ice incidents early in his career.\n\nDater\u2019s take: Kane has been a top NHL player for a while, though it\u2019s surprising that he has scored 30 goals in a season only once in his career. He can be streaky but always seems to bring it in the biggest games. Kane and Jonathan Toews signed long-term contract extensions last season and figure to torture NHL goalies for a long time. Kane\u2019s stick-handling ability might be the best in the league.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "NHL,Patrick Kane,Spotlight", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "All Things Avalanche", "description": "Patrick Kane was the No. 1 pick in the 2007 NHL draft and has helped Chicago win two Stanley Cups.", "title": "Patrick Kane: Spotlight on the Blackhawks right wing", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/avs/2014/11/22/patrick-kane-spotlight-blackhawks-right-wing/20151/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/avs/files/2014/11/Patrick-Kane.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Patrick Kane was the No. 1 pick in the 2007 NHL draft and has helped Chicago win two Stanley Cups.", "creator": "@adater", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/avs/2014/11/22/patrick-kane-spotlight-blackhawks-right-wing/20151/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/avs/files/2014/11/Patrick-Kane.jpg", "title": "Patrick Kane: Spotlight on the Blackhawks right wing", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Patrick Kane was the No. 1 pick in the 2007 NHL draft and has helped Chicago win two Stanley Cups."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf6d7\"", "article_summary": "Spotlight on\u2026 Patrick Kane, right wing, BlackhawksWhen: The Avalanche plays the Blackhawks for the first time this season Wednesday at the Pepsi Center, the second of back-to-back games for the Avs.\nWhat\u2019s up: Patrick Kane is off to another fine start at age 26.\nHe scored a dazzling goal Thursday to help the Blackhawks beat the Calgary Flames and has maintained close to a point-per-game average.\nKane and Jonathan Toews signed long-term contract extensions last season and figure to torture NHL goalies for a long time.\nHe is a colorful player and personality, and has cleaned up his reputation since some off-ice incidents early in his career."}
