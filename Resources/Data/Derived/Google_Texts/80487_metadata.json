They waved them at their faces and kept to the shadow of the large hangar as they waited for a stream of speakers including Gov. Nathan Deal and U.S. Rep. Tom Graves to approach the lectern.\n\nThe Rev. Harvey Palmer sat at one of several tables set up under the shade of the hangar. A black minister who previously served Metropolitan United Methodist Church in Rome, Palmer said it was expected when he grew up that blacks would become Democrats.\n\nPalmer quickly noted, however, that he felt some of the best decisions over the years have come from Republicans.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s how we became interested in party politics,\u201d Palmer said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about who\u2019s right, it\u2019s about what\u2019s right.\u201d\n\nLess government, less regulation \u2014 that\u2019s what Beth Martin wanted to hear from candidates. Martin came to the rally with her husband, Colin Martin, who failed to unseat Columbus Mayor Teresa Tomlinson in her re-election bid earlier this year.\n\nA physician, Beth Martin pointed to Obamacare as a problem she wants fixed.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve got no idea what they\u2019re doing and it just doesn\u2019t work,\u201d she said. \u201cThey tried to create something that\u2019s one size fits all and it just doesn\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nThe buzz of the crowd softened as speakers took their turns at the lectern. U.S. Rep. Tom Graves likened the two main political parties to teams, telling the crowd they knew which team was the right choice.\n\nLt. Gov. Casey Cagle said people should remember the party\u2019s principles and why they\u2019re fighting. He said some want an entitlement society.\n\n\u201cI will promise you, the Democrats are coming,\u201d Cagle told the crowd of more than 200 people. \u201cThey will try to make Georgia a purple state. We do not need that to happen.\u201d\n\nCagle will face Democrat Connie Stokes in November.\n\nRepublican state Sen. Josh McKoon came from Columbus for the rally. A former Karen Handel and Jack Kingston supporter, McKoon said Republicans must unite for the general election.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve just got to bring everyone together and work really hard and not take anything for granted,\u201d McKoon said. \u201cWe can\u2019t become complacent.\u201d\n\nSome took the opportunity on Saturday to have their own voices heard in a presidential straw poll. Forty-five people paid $1 each to pick their top three choices for the next occupant of the White House.\n\nTexas Gov. Rick Perry won first place with 16.9 percent of the vote. U.S. Sen. Rand Paul and former U.S. Rep. Allen West tied for second with 12.1 percent.\n\nFormer Florida Gov. Jeb Bush took third place with 10.5 percent of the vote.\n\nClick to visit the Floyd County Republican Party website.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Northwest Georgia News", "description": "Large fans sat at the edges of Tillman Hangar for Saturday\u2019s Republican rally, their hum making it difficult to hear for someone standing too close.", "title": "Hundreds show for Republican rally at Richard B.
