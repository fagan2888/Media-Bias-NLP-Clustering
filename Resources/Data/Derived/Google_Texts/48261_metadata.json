Some of it is just plain sickening, reminiscent of the ethnic cleansing attempted in the Balkans. And then, seemingly out of nowhere, a passage pierces the gloom like the sun breaking through the fog. Shavit is walking in the Galillee with Palestinian-Israeli attorney Mohammed Dahla when the lawyer\u2019s phone rings. The family of an accused terrorist is asking Dahla to represent him. From a hilltop, the lawyer calls the Jerusalem police to find his client and declare his interest in the case. Then he and Shavit resume their walk. Justice was served.\n\nDoes the alacrity, the efficiency, the very existence of the Israeli justice system outweigh or negate the occupation of the West Bank? No. Does it matter that in the nearby Arab states, justice is the word for the outcome the government wants? No. Does any of that compensate for what the Palestinians have suffered? No. The answer is always no.\n\nBut the immense virtue of Shavit\u2019s book is its insistent use of the concept of \u201cand.\u201d It is not so much said as implied, and it is actually the theme of the book. Much of Israel\u2019s history is about parallelism. Things happen and at the same time other things happen. Palestinians are oppressed and they are given legal representation. Israel conquers the Gaza Strip and then withdraws. The blogger\u2019s handy word \u201cbut\u201d is of no use here. Nothing balances. Everything exists at the same time.\n\nTake the ethnic cleansing of Lydda during Israel\u2019s War of Independence in 1948. \u201cLydda is our black box,\u201d Shavit writes. \u201cIn it lies the dark secret of Zionism. The truth is that Zionism could not bear Lydda.\u201d\n\nAnd yet the truth is also that the emerging state needed to control the Jerusalem-Tel Aviv road. A civil war was underway, and victory required atrocity. Some 50,000 to 70,000 Palestinians were evicted from the area. The innocent were murdered. Terrible things happened. Shavit provides first-person accounts, but Israeli historians, particularly Benny Morris in his book \u201c 1948: A History of the First Arab-Israeli War ,\u201d have not ignored the ethnic cleansing that produced what the Arabs call \u201cthe Nakba,\u201d the catastrophe. Israel is more than an open society. It is an open wound.\n\n1 of 33 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Tom Toles on revolution in the Middle East View Photos Toles\u2019s take on the situation in Libya, Egypt and beyond.

This is because the country was not ethnically cleansed. Israel did not follow what in 1945 through 1948 was standard behavior \u2014 the population transfers approved by the victors of World War II. Europe was ethnically reorganized \u2014 no Germans in Poland; no Germans in Czechoslovakia, either. And, lest we forget, the British approved the plan to swap Muslims and Hindus in the creation of Pakistan. All over the world, millions died \u2014 at least 500,000 ethnic Germans alone.\n\nShavit is an Israeli aristocrat, if such a thing exists. He is fourth-generation Israeli, a columnist for the robustly left-of-center newspaper Haaretz, and so he knows many of the people who run the country. Unfortunately, it is precisely people like him who could be affected by various academic organizations that want to boycott Israel. One of them, the National Council of the American Studies Association, just passed such a resolution, but from the evidence it could sorely benefit from listening to Israeli academics. The Americans know so much, yet understand so little.\n\nA virtue of Shavit\u2019s virtuous book is that it exhumes the dream of Zionism \u2014 and also its success. This was a movement that saved countless lives, that was fueled by the ovens of Auschwitz, that became imbued with the appealing dreaminess of socialism and whose leaders often espoused tolerance and respect for the Palestinians. (\u201cI am certain that the world will judge the Jewish state by what it will do with the Arabs,\u201d Israel\u2019s first president, Chaim Weizmann, wrote before taking office.) These Zionists never lost sight of the right thing. Sometimes, though, they just couldn\u2019t do it.\n\nShavit has nothing in common with the religiously zealous West Bank settlers. He wants them all \u2014 religious, nationalist, secular, whatever \u2014 gone. This is what I want, too. But when Israel pulled out of the Gaza Strip, it got a daily barrage of rockets by way of thanks. What if the West Bank becomes, like Gaza, a Hamas state?\n\nIn Israel, nothing is easy, which is why the subtitle of Shavit\u2019s book is \u201cThe Triumph and Tragedy of Israel.\u201d One does not balance the other \u2014 and both are true.\n\nRead more from Richard Cohen\u2019s archive.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A land where nothing is balanced and nothing is easy.", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/RichardCohenColumn", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "A land where nothing is balanced and nothing is easy.", "title": "Richard Cohen: Imbalance in Israel", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/richard-cohen-imbalance-in-israel/2013/12/09/3d0dd316-60fe-11e3-bf45-61f69f54fc5f_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2013/04/04/Foreign/Images/APTOPIX_Mideast_Israel_Palestinians.JPEG-0a0bd-6890.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/richard-cohen-imbalance-in-israel/2013/12/09/3d0dd316-60fe-11e3-bf45-61f69f54fc5f_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Richard Cohen, Richard Cohen column, Richard Cohen Washington Post, Israel, Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Israel Gaza, Israel West Bank, Zionism, Ari Shavit, Benny Morris", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/RichardCohenColumn"}, "eomportal-uuid": "3d0dd316-60fe-11e3-bf45-61f69f54fc5f", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Richard Cohen, Richard Cohen column, Richard Cohen Washington Post, Israel, Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Israel Gaza, Israel West Bank, Zionism, Ari Shavit, Benny Morris"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd30b\"", "article_summary": "In Israel, nothing is easy, which is why the subtitle of Shavit\u2019s book is \u201cThe Triumph and Tragedy of Israel.\u201d One does not balance the other \u2014 and both are true.\nIsrael did not follow what in 1945 through 1948 was standard behavior \u2014 the population transfers approved by the victors of World War II.\nIn \u201cMy Promised Land,\u201d Ari Shavit\u2019s anguished book about Israel, there is plenty about the mistreatment of Palestinians \u2014 today, yesterday and always.\nBut when Israel pulled out of the Gaza Strip, it got a daily barrage of rockets by way of thanks.\nUnfortunately, it is precisely people like him who could be affected by various academic organizations that want to boycott Israel."}
