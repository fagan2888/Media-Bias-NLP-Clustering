John Kasich, a Republican, signed a bill permitting anyone in Ohio adopted from 1964 to 1996 to get access to their original birth certificates.\n\nThe change is expected to affect about 400,000 adoptees. People adopted before or after those years were already able to obtain their documents when they turned 18.\n\nOhio activists tried for decades to get a bill passed to open records in those \u201cclosed adoption\u201d years.\n\nBut each year, pro-life activists rose in opposition. A common argument in Ohio and elsewhere is that if birth mothers cannot be guaranteed permanent privacy about the placement of their children, they might choose abortion instead.\n\nNew momentum\n\nThis year, however, the Ohio Right to Life saw the issue \u201cin a whole new light\u201d and ended its opposition to the bill, Ms. Norris said.\n\nSenate Bill 23 passed unanimously in the Ohio Senate and by a 91-2 vote in the Ohio House.\n\nMr. Kasich signed it without hesitation. \u201cHe told me, \u2018We should\u2019ve done this 20 years ago,\u2019\u201d said Ms. Norris, who attended the Dec. 19 signing ceremony.\n\nOther open-records bills haven\u2019t had gubernatorial support: New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, conditionally vetoed a bill in 2011, bitterly disappointing adoption advocates who struggled to get it passed in the state Legislature.\n\nIn vetoing the bill, Mr. Christie said he weighed the issues carefully. \u201cI believe that additional safeguards are needed to best balance the needs of adoptees with the expectations of birth parents who may wish for their identities to remain private,\u201d Mr. Christie wrote.\n\nMs. Norris said Mr. Kasich\u2019s enthusiastic signing of the Ohio legislation might inspire Mr. Christie and others about opening the records. \u201cI\u2019m sure the governors talk. I hope this will set a positive precedent,\u201d she said.\n\nUnder the new Ohio law, birth parents will have one year to file a \u201ccontact-preference\u201d form saying whether and how they welcome contact from a child they have relinquished. They also will have a chance to redact their names from the original birth certificates, although they must file their medical histories. After March 2015, adult adoptees will be able to get their documents.\n\nBack to the past\n\nPoliticians have been swayed by emotional \u201chorror stories\u201d \u2014 adoptees or birth parents showing up unexpectedly on people\u2019s doorsteps \u2014 but evidence shows that few birth parents officially decline all contact with their relinquished children.\n\nIn 2011, the American Adoption Congress compiled data from five states that opened records to adult adoptees in the past decade. In those states, 196 birth parents filed forms saying they wanted \u201cno contact\u201d and 1,103 birth parents filed forms saying they \u201cwanted contact.\u201d Nearly 19,000 adult adoptees asked for their records.\n\nOhio is supposed to publish data on responses so people can see how many people chose which response, Ms. Norris said.\n\nIn a survey of nearly 400 adoptees, about 74 percent said they used the Internet and social media to search for their birth families, the Donaldson Adoption Institute said in a report released this month. Searchers were often successful, but for those who struggled, a core reason was not having a birth parent name or other basic information. \u201cWe need our names,\u201d one adoptee told Donaldson, according to its report \u201cUntangling the Web II.\u201d\n\nMost states require court orders for adult adoptees to obtain their original birth certificates, while a few states \u2014 Alabama, Alaska, Kansas, Oregon, Maine and New Hampshire \u2014 give adult adoptees unrestricted access to their original birth certificates, according to American Adoption Congress.\n\nMs. Norris, who was born in 1960, was able to obtain her original birth certificate many years ago and use it in her search. She learned that her birth mother had married her birth father and had more children \u2014 which meant Ms. Norris had three siblings.\n\nTheir reunion was heartfelt. \u201cMy birth mother said, \u2018I have been praying for this call for 26 years,\u2019\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Adoption reform activists are hoping a newly enacted Ohio law giving adult adoptees access to their original birth records will inspire other states to follow suit.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Adoption reform activists are hoping a newly enacted Ohio law giving adult adoptees access to their original birth records will inspire other states to follow suit.", "title": "Adoption reform activists buoyed by Ohio\u2019s new birth certificate access law", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/dec/25/adoption-reform-activists-buoyed-by-ohios-new-birt/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/12/14/medicaid-republican-politicsjpeg-0e212.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/12/14/medicaid-republican-politicsjpeg-0e212.jpg", "description": "Adoption reform activists are hoping a newly enacted Ohio law giving adult adoptees access to their original birth records will inspire other states to follow suit.", "card": "summary", "title": "Adoption reform activists buoyed by Ohio\u2019s new birth certificate"}, "Author": "Cheryl Wetzstein", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Social Issues, Betsie Norris, John Kasich"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc64e\"", "article_summary": "Adoption reform activists are hoping a newly enacted Ohio law giving adult adoptees access to their original birth records will inspire other states to follow suit.\nThey also will have a chance to redact their names from the original birth certificates, although they must file their medical histories.\nMs. Norris, who was born in 1960, was able to obtain her original birth certificate many years ago and use it in her search.\nJohn Kasich, a Republican, signed a bill permitting anyone in Ohio adopted from 1964 to 1996 to get access to their original birth certificates.\nBack to the pastPoliticians have been swayed by emotional \u201chorror stories\u201d \u2014 adoptees or birth parents showing up unexpectedly on people\u2019s doorsteps \u2014 but evidence shows that few birth parents officially decline all contact with their relinquished children."}
