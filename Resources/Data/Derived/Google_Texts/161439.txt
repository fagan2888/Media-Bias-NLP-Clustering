An Oakland University political science major recently spoke one-on-one with President Barack Obama in Washington, D.C.

Nathan Catey, 20, who works as a digital leader with Organizing for Action, spoke to the president for about two minutes Nov. 9, he said. They discussed Catey’s work with the organization and his professional aspirations.

“It was probably the best experience of my life,” Catey said. “It was so casual and cool. He’s an amazing guy. I was in awe.”

Catey was among some 200 people attending the fall summit for the non-profit issue advocacy group. The organization tackles topics such as immigration, gay marriage, gun control and the Affordable Care Act.

An Oklahoma native, Catey was inspired to take up politics by Obama, he said.

Catey delivered newspapers as a middle school student to pay for a trip to see the president’s first inauguration in 2009.

Catey, a member of Oakland’s chapter of Sigma Alpha Epsilon, joined Organizing for Action in early-2014. He said he hopes to one day head a non-profit organization with an emphasis on training and digital work.
