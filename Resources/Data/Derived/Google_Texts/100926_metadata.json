But both Orman and Pressler have taken positions this cycle that make it difficult to pin them down as partisans running clandestinely for one party or the other.\n\nPressler, for example, is a major supporter of gay marriage, a position rejected by many conservatives in the Republican Party. On foreign policy, he says he leans libertarian and is most in line with someone like former Rep. Ron Paul of Texas. Pressler says he would have voted against arming Syrian rebels.\n\n\"Our military industrial state is much too strong,\" Pressler says. \" I feel strongly that we have been on the wrong path overseas. It leads nowhere. It led nowhere in Iraq or Afghanistan. When are we going to learn?\"\n\nOrman, meanwhile, straddles the middle on many issues. On health care, he says he would not have voted for the Affordable Care Act, but it's unrealistic to expect to repeal it now. On immigration, he does not support \"amnesty,\" but does not believe in deporting undocumented workers who have jobs in Kansas on farms and in manufacturing.\n\nAs independent candidates on the campaign trail, Orman and Pressler have injected a shot of surprise back into the midterm doldrums. And if they're elected and Senate control rests on their shoulders, they could once again be the factor no one expected.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "the-ballot-2014/blogentries", "keyword": "South Dakota", "title": "In the Senate, Independents Greg Orman and Larry Pressler Could Be a Factor", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Greg Orman and Larry Pressler have been a surprise on the campaign trail, but could they change the chamber?", "title": "Independents' Day in the Senate?", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/ballot-2014/2014/10/14/in-the-senate-independents-greg-orman-and-larry-pressler-could-be-a-factor", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/25/6e/b824ac6f4b1e885d6e9e0ee8f2c3/141014-orman-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Greg Orman and Larry Pressler have been a surprise on the campaign trail, but could they change the chamber?", "site": "@USNews", "card": "summary", "title": "In the Senate, Independents Greg Orman and Larry Pressler Could Be a Factor"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "news", "date_published": "Oct. 14, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Lauren Fox,Pulse,picks,2014 Congressional elections,King, Angus,Sanders, Bernie,Kansas,South Dakota", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Greg Orman and Larry Pressler have been a surprise on the campaign trail, but could they change the chamber?"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1854\"", "article_summary": "As independent candidates on the campaign trail, Orman and Pressler have injected a shot of surprise back into the midterm doldrums.\nAnd if they're elected and Senate control rests on their shoulders, they could once again be the factor no one expected.\nPressler, for example, is a major supporter of gay marriage, a position rejected by many conservatives in the Republican Party.\n\"We are in a position that an independent might be very powerful in a closely divided Senate.\"\nBut both Orman and Pressler have taken positions this cycle that make it difficult to pin them down as partisans running clandestinely for one party or the other."}
