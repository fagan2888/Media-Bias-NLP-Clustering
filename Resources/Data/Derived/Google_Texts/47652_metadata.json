Yet now Republicans in Congress have precipitated a shutdown of the federal government and are threatening to let the nation default on its once Triple-A-rated debt.\n\nHow could this be?\n\nSince no one in Washington seems to be listening to anyone on the other side of the standoff, I spent much of the week on the phone with voters and business people in Iowa\u2019s Fourth Congressional District, a sprawling, mostly agricultural region that runs from Sioux City, on the Nebraska border, to Mason City, close to Minnesota in the northwest quadrant of the state. I picked the district because its representative in Congress, the Republican Steve King, has been one of the most outspoken advocates for blocking Obamacare, even if that means shutting down the government or defaulting on the national debt.\n\nIn this bedrock conservative district, I found that people were fed up with the gridlock in Washington. But while they are beginning to question Mr. King\u2019s tactics, they continue to support his core commitment to cutting the size of government.\n\nMr. King has certainly staked out some controversial positions, even by conservative standards, and is a frequent target on both the Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert shows. He claimed that \u201cradical Islamicists\u201d would be \u201cdancing in the streets in greater numbers than they did on Sept. 11\u201d if Obama was elected. He warned that Iowa was in danger of becoming a \u201cgay marriage mecca\u201d and led a successful effort to recall three State Supreme Court judges who ruled in favor of gay marriage. He was one of only 11 members of Congress to oppose aid to victims of Hurricane Katrina, has defended racial profiling and has brushed off concerns about global warming as being \u201cmore religion than science.\u201d He has drawn the ire of animal rights activists with his support for dog and cock fighting while opposing food safety measures. House Speaker John Boehner described some of his comments on illegal immigrants as \u201chateful\u201d and \u201cignorant.\u201d\n\nAs Steffen Schmidt, a professor of political science at Iowa State University in Ames, which lies in Mr. King\u2019s district, put it, \u201cSteve King was Tea Party before there was a Tea Party.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut Representative King has really come to the fore in the current debate over paying for Obamacare and the government shutdown, emerging as a leader of a hard-core group of about two dozen Republican representatives in pursuit of the holy grail of \u201cthe end of Obamacare,\u201d as Mr. King puts it. He has seemingly been everywhere in the media in recent days, which has fueled talk among some conservatives of a possible presidential run. Mr. King has made visits to New Hampshire and South Carolina, both early primary states.\n\nVoters in his district told me in telephone interviews that they didn\u2019t take all he says that seriously. \u201cHe\u2019s kind of radical in the way he talks about things,\u201d said Stan Feekes, assistant general manager of the Farmer\u2019s Coop Society in Sioux Center. \u201cWe wish he\u2019d be a little more gentle. People don\u2019t agree with him on everything, but by and large I\u2019d say he\u2019s been in step with people here.\u201d (Representative King carried Sioux County with 83 percent of the vote.)\n\nProfessor Schmidt said Mr. King shouldn\u2019t be underestimated because of his rhetorical bloopers. \u201cHe\u2019s incredibly charming and engaging. He\u2019s a great storyteller,\u201d he said. \u201cHe runs over every Democrat they throw at him like a bulldozer.\u201d\n\nMr. King carried the Fourth District in 2012 with 53 percent of the vote, a much narrower margin than in his previous races. The district remains the most conservative in Iowa, but a redrawing of the boundaries added the relatively liberal university enclave in Ames as well as some more moderate counties northeast of Des Moines. Professor Schmidt said that, for better or worse, the redistricting hadn\u2019t changed Mr. King\u2019s conservative views in the slightest. Mr. King \u201cis a hard-core, ideologically committed, very conservative Republican. He doesn\u2019t see himself as an extremist. He sees a country that\u2019s out of control on spending, on social issues like gay marriage, and he\u2019s trying to stop it.\u201d\n\nWhen I reached Brent Geels, co-owner of Geels Glass Inc. in Sioux Center, he\u2019d just finished sending an e-mail to Representative King urging him to, as Mr. Geels put it, \u201cstand firm and not back down.\u201d Like many people there I spoke to, Mr. Geels says he thinks the economic harm attributed to a government shutdown, and even that associated with a federal debt default, is overblown by the media, a tactic to get Republicans to cave in. \u201cLook at the sequester,\u201d he said, referring to the automatic spending cuts that took effect in March. \u201cThat was a lot of hype. They went into effect and two months later everyone forgot about them.\u201d Moreover, he feels (as did several other people I interviewed) that there may be a silver lining to the shutdown. \u201cIf we can get along without all these nonessential services, then maybe we don\u2019t need them,\u201d he said. So far, he said, the shutdown has had no impact on his glass business, which he started in May.\n\nPhoto\n\nI was surprised to hear in nearly all my conversations that the issue for people in this part of Iowa is less Obamacare than it is government spending in general. \u201cWe have to sacrifice now so our children will not be drowning in our debt,\u201d Mr. Geels said. \u201cBalancing the budget should be a top priority. But Congress can\u2019t even pass a budget. The reason we have these stopgap funding measures is that they\u2019re not planning ahead. No business could run that way.\u201d\n\nAs for a debt default, Mr. Geels said he wasn\u2019t an expert, and \u201cI\u2019d rather not see it happen.\u201d But, he went on, \u201cIf it means just continuing to raise the debt ceiling and do nothing to cut spending, then I\u2019d just as soon not raise it. I\u2019m 28, and I have three young sons. We need to start making some sacrifices now if we want them to have the standard of living we have.\u201d\n\nIowa has been enjoying unusual prosperity in recent years, with low unemployment, high commodity prices and strong exports of agricultural products and machinery. \u201cWhen your stomach is full and things are going well, it\u2019s easy to say we have to get these guys under control,\u201d said Stan Speer, president of American State Bank in Sioux Center. \u201cIf we had another agricultural crisis like we had in the 1980s, it would be a whole different story.\u201d He said that loan demand had been strong at his bank, but a continued shutdown would begin to affect construction projects that depend on federal programs. \u201cWith winter coming, any delay could have a big impact,\u201d he said. \u201cThen, people may start feeling differently.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Speer agreed with Mr. Geels that people in the district feel federal spending was out of control, but said that they were even more troubled by the paralysis in Washington. \u201cThey feel they\u2019re not getting the representation they deserve,\u201d he said. \u201cThey elected their representatives to govern, and they\u2019re not governing. They\u2019re not doing their jobs. Why should they get paid?\u201d\n\nLarry Den Herder, the chief executive of Interstates Control Systems, a company based in Sioux Center that provides electrical engineering and construction services around the country, said, too, that \u201cpeople are very frustrated that both sides have taken a hard line.\u201d He added: \u201cI blame both sides for being stubborn and obstinate. They need to roll up their sleeves and figure it out. If we had people like that in business we wouldn\u2019t get anything done.\u201d\n\nHe said he was also concerned about the economic impact of a continuing shutdown, as well as the possibility of a debt default. \u201cI think there\u2019s a risk of unforeseen consequences,\u201d he said. \u201cIf our buyers don\u2019t have confidence that we as a nation can get our act together, then the whole market could collapse. I don\u2019t think anyone wants that.\u201d\n\nKathie Obradovich, political columnist for The Des Moines Register, whose brother lives in Sioux Center, said that Iowans had been told by Washington that \u201cthe sky is falling, but they don\u2019t see it.\u201d She added: \u201cUntil they see the reality that there are consequences, they\u2019re not likely to put much pressure on their representatives in Congress.\u201d But she, too, said she\u2019d been hearing from many voters that \u201cCongress isn\u2019t doing its job. A basic requirement is to pass a budget and keep the government going.\u201d\n\nEven in rural Charles City, far from the paralysis in Washington, some people are feeling the effects. Timothy Fox, executive director of the Charles City Development Corporation, said he was troubled that his son\u2019s trip to Effigy Mounds National Monument had been canceled. Government, he said, is \u201clike electricity \u2014 you don\u2019t notice it until you don\u2019t have it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20131004144105, "twitter": {"description": "While Representative Steve King\u2019s constituents are beginning to question his tactics and his focus on the health law, they support his core commitment to cutting the size of government.", "title": "In Rural Iowa, Spending, Not the Shutdown, Raises Worry", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/05/business/in-rural-iowa-ambivalence-about-the-shutdown.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002481334"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/10/05/us/STEWART-2/STEWART-2-thumbLarge-v3.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/05/business/in-rural-iowa-ambivalence-about-the-shutdown.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002481334", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/05/business/in-rural-iowa-ambivalence-about-the-shutdown.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "business", "hdl_p": "In Rural Iowa, Spending, Not the Shutdown, Raises Worry", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/business/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Oct. 4, 2013", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "King  Steven A,Iowa,Tea Party Movement,United States Politics and Government,Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Federal Budget (US),National Debt (US)", "description": "While Representative Steve King\u2019s constituents are beginning to question his tactics and his focus on the health law, they support his core commitment to cutting the size of government.", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "James B.
