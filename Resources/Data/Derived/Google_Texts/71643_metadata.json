Among a random sample of 180 of those veterans, 60 who requested care had not been seen at all by primary care providers, in some cases because the VA never contacted them or because they were left off an eligibility list in error. For the other 120 who requested care and were seen, the average time between their initial requests that the VA contact them for appointments and the dates they were seen ranged from 22 to 71 days.\n\nThe report says the VA does not properly record the time that veterans wait to be seen.\n\nWhile slightly more than half were seen by providers in less than 30 days, the veterans\u2019 experiences varied widely, even within the same medical center, with 12 veterans waiting more than 90 days, the report says.\n\nThe most recent national data from the VA shows that, on average, the wait time for primary care appointments as of April 1, 2016, was seven days -- down from 7.94 days a year ago.\n\nIn Connecticut, the West Haven VA shows a wait time for primary care of just 1.72 days -- relatively low nationally. Overall, more than 97 percent of veterans seeking health care in West Haven get appointments scheduled within 30 days, the data show.\n\nOther VAs have much longer waits. The average wait for a primary care appointment in Fayetteville, North Carolina, is 52.76 days; in White City, Oregon, 51.14 days; and in Dover, Tennessee, 48 days.\n\nNationally, wait times for specialty care average 10 days, and for mental health care, four days. At the\n\nWest Haven VA, wait times are 4.86 days for specialty care and 2.25 days for mental health care, the most recent data show.\n\nThe GAO report found that two factors generally impacted veterans\u2019 wait times: Appointments were not always available when veterans wanted to be seen, and \u201cweaknesses in VA medical scheduling practices\u201d led to some veterans not being contacted on a timely basis.\n\n\u201cOfficials at each of the six medical centers in our review told us that they have difficulty keeping up with the demand for primary care appointments for new patients because of shortages in the number of providers, or lack of space due to rapid growth in the demand for these services,\u201d the GAO said.\n\nAlso, the report says, the VA does not properly record the time that veterans wait to be seen, starting from the veterans\u2019 \u201cpreferred dates\u201d for appointments, instead of the dates that veterans initially contact the VA to schedule appointments. These \u201cscheduling errors, such as incorrectly revising preferred dates when rescheduling appointments, understated the amount of time veterans waited to see providers,\u201d the GAO said.\n\nFor example, one veteran mentioned in the report applied for VA health care benefits in December 2014, which included a request to be contacted for an initial appointment. The VA medical center contacted the veteran to schedule a primary care appointment 43 days later. When making the appointment, the medical center recorded the veteran\u2019s preferred date as March 1, 2015, and the veteran saw a provider on March 3, 2015. Although the medical center\u2019s data showed the veteran waited two days to see a provider, the total amount of time that elapsed from the veteran\u2019s request until the veteran was seen was actually 76 days.\n\nThe GAO recommended that the VA monitor the full amount of time that veterans wait to see a primary care provider and improve contact with veterans seeking appointments -- recommendations that the VA accepted.\n\nThis story was reported under a partnership with the Connecticut Health I-Team (C-hit.org).", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health", "description": "Some newly enrolled veterans seeking a primary care appointment at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) wait more than 90 days before they see a", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://wnpr.org/post/new-report-cites-long-wait-times-va-primary-care", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wnpr/files/styles/medium/public/201604/20140527_Health-Benefits-Goal.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Some newly enrolled veterans seeking a primary care appointment at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) wait more than 90 days before they see a", "title": "New Report Cites Long Wait Times for VA Primary Care"}, "org_id": 0, "twitter": {"site": "@wnpr", "card": "summary"}, "author": "Lisa Chedekel", "wordCount": 978, "dc": {"title": "New Report Cites Long Wait Times for VA Primary Care"}, "nid": 57469, "datePublished": "2016-04-21", "story_id": 475094100, "keywords": "The Daily, veterans, health care", "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf174\"", "article_summary": "At theWest Haven VA, wait times are 4.86 days for specialty care and 2.25 days for mental health care, the most recent data show.\nNationally, wait times for specialty care average 10 days, and for mental health care, four days.\nIn Connecticut, the West Haven VA shows a wait time for primary care of just 1.72 days -- relatively low nationally.\nThe report says the VA does not properly record the time that veterans wait to be seen.\nThe GAO recommended that the VA monitor the full amount of time that veterans wait to see a primary care provider and improve contact with veterans seeking appointments -- recommendations that the VA accepted."}
