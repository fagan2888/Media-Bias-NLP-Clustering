What do you do when the actual reality of a news story is not evenly balanced between two sides? What do you do when the facts of a situation are such that to describe them accurately will make you sound biased?\n\nThis month\u2019s fiscal crisis is one such situation. One party (in fact, essentially one wing of the Republican party), seeking the elimination or delay of Obamacare, precipitated a government shutdown and threatened to force a default on U.S. debt. Period. There was no corresponding threat or demand on the Democratic or White House side; having gotten the Affordable Care Act into law three years ago, they are not in the situation of saying, \u201cPass Obamacare or we shut \u2018er down.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the situation. To accurately describe it, as news coverage should, is not to endorse an ideology. It\u2019s not to say that Obamacare is good or bad. It\u2019s not to say that Republicans do or don\u2019t have good reasons to oppose it. It\u2019s not to say that Democrats have or haven\u2019t sought political benefit in the aftermath. But it correctly places the impetus where it belongs.\n\nMuch of the big-picture news coverage has been clear on this. But as the crisis dragged on, more news stories framed the story as old-fashioned bipartisan gridlock between two equally culpable, stubborn, useless sides. It becomes \u201cBoehner, White House Harden Stances\u201d (Washington Post); \u201cCongress Plays Chicken\u201d (a CNN chyron this morning); \u201ceach side trying to blame the other\u201d (Politico).\n\n\u201cBoth sides are to blame; the truth is somewhere in between\u201d\u2013that has always been the political media\u2019s happy, safe place. Some of the reasons are noble; journalists genuinely want to give both sides a hard, fair look. (Understandable, given the amount of simple, partisan sloganeering out there, like Fox News spinning the shutdown as a \u201cslimdown\u201d or MSNBC, as I write this, captioning its coverage with a GOP elephant next to the phrase \u201cRANSOM NOTES.\u201d) Some reasons are less proud: wanting to keep access to pols in each party, not wanting to alienate any readers or viewers, because subscription and advertising dollars know no party. Seeming fair becomes more important than being fair.\n\nAt worst, a legitimate impulse (\u201cLet\u2019s make sure we\u2019ve checked out the other side\u201d) becomes skewing reality for the sake of appearances (\u201cWe have to put in an example of the other side doing this\u201d). It\u2019s a way of ingratiating yourself, having a populist point-of-view divorced from a political one: those bums in Congress won\u2019t do their jobs, but we\u2019re on your side, America! (See Don Lemon on CNN this weekend, haranguing a Democratic and Republican representative, \u201cWhy the hell can\u2019t you work it out?\u201d Update: To be fair, Lemon also asked his GOP guest to \u201cstop holding the American people hostage.\u201d) If all else fails, you can always quote ideologues in each party and make your lead paragraph, \u201cCongress points fingers.\u201d\n\nAh, saved by the magic fingers again. Media critics, especially on the left, call this kind of thumb-on-the-blame-scales balance \u201cfalse equivalence.\u201d That charge itself can be used as a crowbar to try to leverage coverage in one direction, or to obscure issues in a dust cloud of \u201cBut they started it!\u201d Not every criticism of two parties needs to come with a numerical assessment of who did it first and worse; that can make every politics story as recrimination- and second-guess-filled an exercise as trying to slice the last brownie in half for a pair of five-year-olds. (See, for instance, the liberal whinging over Jon Stewart\u2019s Rally to Restore Sanity in 2010.)\n\nBut in a case like the fiscal crisis, false equivalence matters. It\u2019s the difference between reporting an extraordinary event and an ordinary one, which in this case is crucial to how the story plays out politically. It\u2019s a matter of whether \u201cnot changing current law\u201d becomes redefined as \u201cgetting 100% of what you want.\u201d If this is just one more case of those knuckleheads in Washington \u201cdigging in their heels,\u201d \u201cplaying the blame game,\u201d and so on, it normalizes the situation for the news audience: it sends the tacit message that it is entirely ordinary, every so often, to have a forced debt crisis that reasonable people resolve through \u201ccompromise\u201d by renegotiating major pieces of U.S. law.\n\nIs the situation ordinary? It\u2019s true that legislators of both parties\u2013like Sen. Obama in 2006\u2013have made grandstanding votes against the debt limit many times in the past. But those were stage-managed protests in which votes were carefully counted and there was no serious fear the U.S. would actually default, unlike in 2011, when the crisis resulted in a downgrade of the U.S. credit rating. That\u2019s another case where \u201cthe other side did it too\u201d does not an equivalence make.\n\nSo here, \u201cBoth sides got us into this mess\u201d sounds neutral, but it\u2019s actually taking a side\u2013or, at least, adopting the framing that one side is counting on using to a political end. Reality doesn\u2019t always have a bias, liberal or otherwise. But when it does, it\u2019s not journalism\u2019s job to rebalance reality.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"Reality,\" Stephen Colbert once said, \"has a well-known liberal bias.\" He was joking--or \"joking\"--but he identified a serious problem for political reporters in a polarized era.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "People can argue the rights and wrongs of the showdown, but pinning the crisis on a bipartisan failure of \"Congress\" is a media copout", "title": "Not \u201cBoth Sides,\u201d Now: Why False Equivalence Matters in the Shutdown Showdown | TIME.com", "url": "http://entertainment.time.com/2013/10/07/not-both-sides-now-why-false-equivalence-matters-in-the-shutdown-showdown/", "image": "https://timeentertainment.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/16.jpg?w=597", "type": "article"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "What\u2019s good, bad and happening, from pop culture to high culture", "msvalidate.01": "D5D31ED89855B2C2D8411F1F8B2367B6", "fb": {"admins": "1124331582,512158401,808970553,100000018008769", "app_id": 53177223193}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://entertainment.time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/0df4e433005015e27e2188e452d16236?s=16", "application-name": "Entertainment", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/TIME"}, "keywords": "media, tuned in,", "google-site-verification": "U7OX9IjuXnaDf-CoTeQzJwWanr44JrFSBJt044vng_0", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "media, tuned in,"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe103d\"", "article_summary": "But in a case like the fiscal crisis, false equivalence matters.\nWhat do you do when the actual reality of a news story is not evenly balanced between two sides?\n\u201cBoth sides are to blame; the truth is somewhere in between\u201d\u2013that has always been the political media\u2019s happy, safe place.\nBut as the crisis dragged on, more news stories framed the story as old-fashioned bipartisan gridlock between two equally culpable, stubborn, useless sides.\nThat\u2019s another case where \u201cthe other side did it too\u201d does not an equivalence make."}
