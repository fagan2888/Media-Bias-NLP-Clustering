Value-based payment, along with a renewed emphasis on developing healthy communities, makes care coordination among community providers in multiple entities a necessity.\n\nToday\u2019s leaders need a transorganizational mindset. This mindset is a paradigm shift: Top leaders must understand connections and work among a network of different organizations and community stakeholders. Leaders must look beyond the health system boundaries to discover how community organizations and providers can work together to coordinate care and improve outcomes.\n\nComplex strategies, such as value-based payment and population health, require leaders who are more than collaborators addressing individual issues. As transorganizational leaders, they must assume a collective responsibility to achieve mutual goals that improve quality and equity of health outcomes. The best health system executives and trustees are leading through relationships within and outside of their primary responsibility \u2014 they are conducting shared leadership.\n\nFor example, let\u2019s look at the goal to improve health outcomes for a chronic disease, such as diabetes, for defined patient population groups. Achieving that goal requires building relationships across the continuum of care and beyond. The resulting structure may include networks of primary care and specialty physicians, nurse practitioners, outpatient services, clinical care units, community health clinics, urgent care centers and pharmacies. In addition, patients and at-risk community members need education and assistance with self-care and prevention practices. This work may involve alliances with schools, community groups, grocery stores, religious congregations and other community services.\n\nTransorganizational Roots\n\nTransorganizational is not a fad word or concept. Academic thought leaders such as Drs. Samuel A. Culbert, David Boje, Thomas G. Cummings and Kurt Motamedi began talking about planned change in networks of organizations a couple of decades ago. They suggested that change often involves more than one organization, which requires working among a network of organizations. This requirement has been true in health care for a long time.\n\nA slower evolution among health care leaders is breaking out of silo thinking \u2014 that is, failing to include other entities in change efforts or share information outside of organizational boundaries. Silo thinking may persist because of the way health care administrators were taught leadership, with an emphasis on one organizational system.\n\nPopulation health, value-based payment and building healthy communities all depend on working in many organizations and networks. Executives and board members need to become adaptive leaders who quickly develop a transorganizational mindset if they are to work effectively. A way of doing this is to \u201clearn in action.\u201d\n\nLearning in Action\n\nThe path to change for many executives and trustees is learning from what they are already doing. Developing a transorganizational mindset need not be another scheduled task in an already demanding schedule. However, learning in moments of action is not always easy, because there are so many projects and initiatives in play at one time.\n\nA simple way to reflect on performance and learn in action is to ask such questions as the following:\n\n\u2022 What are we learning from our experiences of working with other organizations and the community?\n\n\u2022 What are we learning about our leadership?\n\n\u2022 What can we do differently that would make a significant difference?\n\n\u2022 What should we keep doing that really matters to our stakeholders?\n\nI suggest setting aside a few minutes during executive team and trustee meetings to ask questions like these. I recommend active listening to learn from everyone engaged in the conversation. It can be useful to document the key learning points so they can be recalled, as strategies are being implemented and future meetings unfold. This is an ongoing learning process that informs transorganizational work and the execution of mutual goals.\n\nShifting the Mindset\n\nWhile learning plays a significant role in making the shift to transorganizational thinking, being aware of what a leader is thinking also can be helpful. With the collective good in mind \u2014 that is, the health of patients and the community \u2014 it is much easier to be a transorganizational thinker. This shifts a leader\u2019s thinking from being merely a health care provider to being a community partner in improving quality of care and population health.\n\nTaking on the role of community partner adds to the complexity of leadership. It is challenging to work with different organizations and to develop and implement strategies that improve health and health care. There are many viewpoints on care coordination and improving the equity of health outcomes.\n\nSometimes, there is a tendency to minimize the complexity. It can feel overwhelming and time-consuming to gain consensus on decisions. But when the complexity of viewpoints is not minimized, the ability to see interrelationships and interdependencies becomes clearer. In this way, the focus is on seeking common ground rather than differences.\n\nThe good of the patients and the community can serve as a core purpose for all partners. This clarity enables leaders to transcend the complexity. They see through it to gain a sense of the best way to achieve shared goals. With a core purpose in mind, leaders are able to determine the best approaches for sharing information and resources. Shifting to transorganizational thinking demands being purposeful in acting for the greater good of all those who are served.\n\nMoving Forward\n\nGeorge Bernard Shaw effectively makes the case for changing mindsets: \u201cProgress is impossible without change, and those who cannot change their minds cannot change anything.\u201d The transorganizational mindset is a powerful way of thinking that can help executives and boards move the collective goals of health care and healthy communities forward.
