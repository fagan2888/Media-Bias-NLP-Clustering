Denver residents can take advantage of warm Saturday temperatures and partly sunny skies before a rainy Sunday with a snowy evening, likely to make for a wet Broncos game.

Temperatures are expected to soar to a balmy 60 degrees with clouds rolling in as the evening progresses, according to the National Weather Service in Boulder

In true Colorado fashion, folks can expect to ditch their sunglasses and don their hats and gloves Sunday as a rainy, 47 degree day turns into a good chance of snow in the afternoon and before 11 p.m, the weather service said.

Forecasters predict an inch of snow accumulation to fall in the evening.

In the mountains, light snow is expected throughout Sunday afternoon and evening with a chance of snow on Monday. The precipitation is expected to stop by Tuesday morning with an estimated accumulation of 3 to 12 inches in the high country.

Monday dips even cooler along the Front Range with a high of 37 degrees and a 10 percent chance of snow before 11 a.m. Skies are expected to clear in the afternoon, allowing some sunlight to shine through.
