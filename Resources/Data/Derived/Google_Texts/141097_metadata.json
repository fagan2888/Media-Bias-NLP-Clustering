Other changes, such as the introduction of digital dentistry \u2014 transitioning from mechanical to computer-controlled components \u2014 represent the main concerns of dental manufacturers in Central Pennsylvania.\n\nDental manufacturing changes\n\nThe past four or five years have brought the greatest change in dentistry with new digital units and implant technologies, according to Pamela Ament, co-owner of Lititz based Toothsmiths, which specializes in custom dental prosthetics and lab services. In business for 27 years, she and her husband, Jim Ament, have seen many changes.\n\n\u201cCorporate dentistry is driving prices down, but the cost of manufacturing hasn\u2019t changed dramatically,\u201d Pamela Ament said. There is still a need for digital- and analog-skilled technicians.\n\nAt Dentsply, industry changes led to the recently announced merger with Sirona Dental Systems Inc. of New York City, a union that is expected to create the world\u2019s largest manufacturer of professional dental products and technologies. The combined company, Dentsply Sirona, will be worth $13.3 billion.\n\n\u201cThe future of dentistry is about providing total solutions across the spectrum of treatments for the patient,\u201d said Meghan Smith, spokeswoman for York-based Dentsply. \u201cThere is no better combination than the merger of Dentsply and Sirona to meet the future demands and trends in dentistry.\u201d\n\nSmith noted recent industry trends involve the adoption of digital dentistry and increasing demand for integrated solutions.\n\nThe medical device tax\n\nThe potential impact on dentistry of the medical-device tax remains to be seen, according to an article on www.dentalproductsreport.com, which cited an interview with Fred Freedman, vice president of marketing and member relations for the Dental Trade Association.\n\nThe tax of 2.3 percent took effect in 2013 and applies to medical devices that \u201care being manufactured, prepared, propagated, compounded, or processed \u2026 for commercial distribution.\u201d\n\nThe levy\u2019s impact on Dentsply is unclear. In 2014, the York-based manufacturer had annual revenue of $4.65 billion, which was a drop from $5.1 billion in 2013.\n\nNo one was available at Dentsply to comment on the specific effects of the ACA or medical-device tax on the company, as well as industry challenges the company is facing.\n\nToothsmiths, meanwhile, is not affected by the medical-device tax, Pamela Ament said.\n\nThe ACA and dental care\n\nWhile more people have coverage for dental care, Album noted, insurers still struggle to hold onto enrollees after they sign up.\n\n\u201cAlmost half a million signed up in 2015, but fewer than half paid the first month or continued to pay after the first month,\u201d Album said.\n\nAccording to Album, dental benefits are remarkably uniform, though the cost can vary based on the providers and the types of services and materials that are needed.\n\nHe sees premiums staying relatively flat in 2016. Consumers mainly use dental insurance for diagnostic and preventive care, such as cleanings, X-rays, check-ups and fluoride treatments.\n\n\u201cFrom a manufacturing standpoint, these are all benefits going to people who did not previously have dental insurance,\u201d Album said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Central Penn Business Journal", "description": "Like other health-related industries, dentistry has not escaped the reach of the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Dental manufacturing faces challenges in digitizing industry | CPBJ", "url": "http://www.cpbj.com/article/20151002/CPBJ01/151009964/dental-manufacturing-faces-challenges-in-digitizing-industry", "image": "http://www.cpbj.com/storyimage/JP/20151002/CPBJ01/151009964/AR/0/AR-151009964.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "cpbj.com", "description": "Like other health-related industries, dentistry has not escaped the reach of the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Dental manufacturing faces challenges in digitizing industry | CPBJ", "image": {"src": "http://www.cpbj.com/storyimage/JP/20151002/CPBJ01/151009964/AR/0/AR-151009964.jpg"}, "site": "@cpbj", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "Like other health-related industries, dentistry has not escaped the reach of the Affordable Care Act.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The ACA and dental careWhile more people have coverage for dental care, Album noted, insurers still struggle to hold onto enrollees after they sign up.\nOn the plus side, more people can access dental care, according to Jeff Album, vice president of public and government affairs for Delta Dental Insurance.\n\u201cFrom a manufacturing standpoint, these are all benefits going to people who did not previously have dental insurance,\u201d Album said.\nAccording to Album, dental benefits are remarkably uniform, though the cost can vary based on the providers and the types of services and materials that are needed.\nOther changes, such as the introduction of digital dentistry \u2014 transitioning from mechanical to computer-controlled components \u2014 represent the main concerns of dental manufacturers in Central Pennsylvania."}
