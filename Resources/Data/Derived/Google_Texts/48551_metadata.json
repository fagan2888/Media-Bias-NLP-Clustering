The definition of a \"customer\" is so broad under the stay provision that it can stay litigation against almost any manufacturer that violates a patent.

We need to be careful of making changes across the board that limit the rights of innovators to defend their intellectual property through the legal system.\n\nStay abreast of the latest developments from nation's capital and beyond with curated News Alerts from the Washington Examiner news desk and delivered to your inbox.

And yet they have each passed their respective committees, even in the face of bipartisan opposition. In their current state, these bills would spell disaster for innovation in America.\n\nAmericans need to be aware of the harm these bills would do to inventors. As Senator Ted Cruz, R-Texas, one of only two Republicans who had the courage to stand against the bill in committee, stated during mark-up, \"I think we need to be particularly solicitous of protecting inventors, protecting the little guy, protecting those who are asserting their rights protected by the United States Constitution to develop new innovations, and I fear that if we lean too far against the small patent holder that in turn will hamper innovation in our economy.\"\n\nSen. Cruz's statement puts the consequences mildly. I have consistently warned of the dangers of these bills: The troublesome crony capitalism at work and strings being pulled behind the scenes by companies like Google; the dangers of moving bills forward that compromise intellectual property and put America's policies in line with those of countries like China; the problems innovators \u2014 everyone from your local inventor to medical research programs at universities \u2014 will have securing funding and maintaining sound ownership of their inventions.\n\nBut, more concerning is the issue that Carly Fiorina, the former CEO of Hewlett-Packard, has so succinctly raised. \"Watch carefully who is supporting that legislation,\" she has said. \"It's not the small it's the big. It's the big companies whose ongoing economic benefit depends upon their ability to acquire innovations and patents at a lower cost.\"\n\nTherein lies perhaps the greatest concern regarding this legislation. It favors tech giants that would have the financial and legal resources to weather the storm that would be created if the proposed legislation passes. It will make defending the intellectual property of small inventors, universities, venture capitalists and virtually everyone who makes up the ground floor of American innovation nearly impossible.\n\nThe rush to support big business at the cost of small inventors is more than a little concerning. The result will be a David and Goliath scenario in which Congress has stripped David of his slingshot. If these bills pass, Goliath \u2014 Big Business in America \u2014 will walk away unscathed, but smaller inventors will be left defenseless.\n\nAs they are now, the Innovation Act and the PATENT Act would help a few powerful companies, hurt small inventors and cripple our culture of innovation. We need to work to defeat or to amend them before they are allowed to undermine the greatness of the American patent system and strip American innovators of the rights and protections enshrined by our founders in the Constitution.\n\nKen Blackwell, former Ohio Secretary of State, is on the board of the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, Club for Growth and National Taxpayers Union.
