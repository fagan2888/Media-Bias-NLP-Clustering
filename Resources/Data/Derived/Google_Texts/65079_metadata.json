Stewart\u2019s character takes an elbow to the face, is spit on and splattered with excrement, but learns her treatment is nothing compared to the detainees.\n\nThe movie is sympathetic to the prisoners\u2019 plight; Stewart\u2019s character eventually forms a bond with innocent inmate Ali Amir, played by Peyman Moaadi.\n\nIn an interview with The Associated Press, Stewart said she relished playing such a strong character.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a movie about somebody who doesn\u2019t seem made up. I read this thing and felt like I wanted to stand up for her. It felt really real to me and I felt like it was something that I was willing to do anything for,\u201d she said in a phone interview last week. \u201cI haven\u2019t played too many parts that I feel like are really outside of myself. And it\u2019s quiet and when something really quiet punches you in the stomach, that\u2019s what I like to do.\u201d\n\nStewart was on hand with the rest of the cast for the Sundance debut. After the film was shown, first-time filmmaker Peter Sattler told the audience that he got the inspiration for \u201cCamp X-Ray\u201d after watching documentary footage of a guard and a detainee talking about books on a library cart. In his film, the two main characters similarly bond over the prison\u2019s book selection.\n\nSattler originally intended Stewart\u2019s role for a male, but he shifted to a female lead because he felt it created more conflict between the two.\n\n\u201cAnd Muslims\u2019 extremist relationship toward women also complicated (the story),\u201d he said. \u201cSo I clicked into that.\u201d\n\nLane Garrison, who also plays a guard in the movie, told the audience that working on \u201cCamp X-Ray\u201d shifted his thinking of Guantanamo Bay, which has been the center of a battle over whether it should close. President Barack Obama has said he would like to see it shut down.\n\n\u201cI had a belief that everyone down there was responsible for 9/11,\u201d said Garrison. \u201cAfter doing this film I started asking questions about Guantanamo Bay and come to find out that there are still men down there that no country wants and I started thinking \u2018What if there is a guy down there that is innocent that\u2019s not a terrorist \u2014 does he deserve that day in court? It changed me to start asking questions and not just go along with the flow.\u201d\n\nThe film is a candidate in the festival\u2019s U.S. dramatic competition.
