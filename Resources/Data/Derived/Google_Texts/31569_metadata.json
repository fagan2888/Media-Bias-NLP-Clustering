A video of the encounter quickly went viral online.\n\nThe southern Georgia university sided with the students, saying they had a constitutional right to trample the flag. Ms. Manhart was issued a criminal trespass warning and banned from the campus and all student activities, including graduation and football games. She is not a student.\n\nFox News reported Friday that the university opted to give students and staff the day off ahead of a massive, 90-minute afternoon rally on the outskirts of campus. Organizers told Fox on Friday that they expected as many as 4,000 people to attend the \u201cFlags Over Valdosta\u201d event.\n\n\u201cThat level of traffic and that many people will disrupt a lot of things in the city,\u201d university spokesman Andy Clark said, Fox reported. \u201cWe\u2019re, from an overall safety perspective, looking to close the campus down today so they can have a peaceful rally.\u201d\n\nMs. Manhart, who was relieved of duty after posing nude for Playboy in February 2007, told Fox that she hopes the school will lift the ban and let her back on campus.\n\n\u201cI hope they lift the ban because I do support the college,\u201d she said. \u201cI always have and I will continue to support the college. And I hope that once things calm down maybe they\u2019ll reconsider and lift that ban off of me.\u201d Ms. Manhart owns a tanning salon in Valdosta.\n\nShe said that the students who trampled the flag were wrong and showed a total lack of respect for their country.\n\n\u201cTo me it\u2019s just a complete disrespect, to not only the men and women that are out there fighting for it but their freedom as a whole,\u201d she said, Fox reported. \u201cIn my opinion they don\u2019t have any respect for what they\u2019ve been given and I just don\u2019t think that\u2019s right.\u201d\n\nThis week campus police found a backpack containing a handgun and traced it to one of the flag-walking protestors, Eric Sheppard.\n\nPolice issued a warrant for Mr. Sheppard\u2019s arrest on charges of bringing a firearm onto a college campus. Mr. Sheppard fled and has not been found by authorities, according to Fox.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Georgia college cancelled classes Friday in anticipation of a rally for a military veteran who was arrested for taking an American flag from student protestors.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A Georgia college cancelled classes Friday in anticipation of a rally for a military veteran who was arrested for taking an American flag from student protestors.", "title": "Michelle Manhart support rally held in Georgia; veteran stopped students\u2019 flag-walking protest", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/25/michelle-manhart-support-rally-held-in-georgia-vet/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/24/26e155b75d2e9d12740f6a7067007b63.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/24/26e155b75d2e9d12740f6a7067007b63.jpg", "description": "A Georgia college cancelled classes Friday in anticipation of a rally for a military veteran who was arrested for taking an American flag from student protestors.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Michelle Manhart support rally held in Georgia; veteran stopped studen"}, "Author": "Kellan Howell", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Education, Michelle Manhart"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda32a\"", "article_summary": "Police issued a warrant for Mr. Sheppard\u2019s arrest on charges of bringing a firearm onto a college campus.\nThe southern Georgia university sided with the students, saying they had a constitutional right to trample the flag.\n\u201cThat level of traffic and that many people will disrupt a lot of things in the city,\u201d university spokesman Andy Clark said, Fox reported.\nValdosta State University became a hotbed of controversy last week when Air Force veteran Michelle Manhart took an American flag away from a group of students trampling it during a protest against racism.\n\u201cTo me it\u2019s just a complete disrespect, to not only the men and women that are out there fighting for it but their freedom as a whole,\u201d she said, Fox reported."}
