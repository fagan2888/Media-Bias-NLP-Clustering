John Kasich signed a bill Sunday that strips $1.3 million in taxpayer money from the organization.\n\nTen states\u2014Wisconsin and Ohio being the most recent\u2014have taken action over the past several months to cut taxpayer dollars from Planned Parenthood.\n\n\u201cNot one more penny should go to Planned Parenthood, a scandal-plagued abortion business that does not provide comprehensive health care services for women,\u201d Casey Mattox, Alliance Defending Freedom senior counsel, said in a statement.\n\nThe Ohio Legislature passed the bill, H.B. 294, earlier this month and sent it to Kasich, a Republican, for his signature. Under the new law, state and certain federal funds will be directed to federally qualified health centers and departments instead of entities that perform or promote elective abortions.\n\nMattox, who testified before the Ohio Senate\u2019s Government Oversight and Reform Committee to provide legal opinion on an earlier Senate version of the bill, added:\n\nOhio\u2019s new law terminates funding for Planned Parenthood and other abortion businesses, freeing up money for more widely available and more comprehensive low-cost health care options for women and families in the state. Taxpayer dollars should not go to organizations with a long track record of abusive and potentially fraudulent billing practices, that have been caught in authenticated undercover videos negotiating prices for baby body parts, and that have repeatedly failed to report the sexual abuse of girls. Ohio is right to end its relationship with organizations undeserving of taxpayer money and unworthy of the taxpayers\u2019 trust.\n\nPlanned Parenthood has fought other states\u2019 efforts to cut off its funding, arguing that its constitutional rights were being violated.\n\nThe legislation \u201cwill have devastating consequences for women across Ohio,\u201d Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America and Planned Parenthood Action Fund, said in a statement.\n\nAt least a dozen state governments and the U.S. Congress began investigations into Planned Parenthood following videos released by the Center for Medical Progress (CMP) last summer. The videos, which showed undercover footage, sparked a nationwide conversation into alleged illegal conduct by Planned Parenthood.\n\n\u201cPlanned Parenthood\u2019s involvement in abortion is well-known,\u201d Chuck Donovan, president of the Charlotte Lozier Institute, told The Daily Signal. \u201cThe Center for Medical Progress videos have just pointed out exactly what that means in a way that you can\u2019t look away from it.\u201d\n\nDavid Daleiden, founder of CMP, and his colleague Sandra Merritt were indicted for falsifying driver\u2019s licenses used during their investigation into Planned Parenthood. Daleiden was also indicted for knowingly and intentionally offering to buy fetal tissue. Planned Parenthood has claimed no wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cThe Center for Medical Progress put this on the national agenda,\u201d Donovan said. \u201cSo much of government ends up being pointing out something that\u2019s been a problem for a while and finally recognizing that the bureaucracy has let things happen.\u201d\n\nDonovan thinks the legal battle over the videos will have \u201cvery little effect.\u201d\n\nThe videos are not the only factor that has played into states, like Ohio, defunding Planned Parenthood.\n\nA couple of states defunded Planned Parenthood well before the videos were released, Donovan says. The videos, he says, expedited the process and made clear how Planned Parenthood \u201cunderscored the humanity of the baby.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just allegations of harvesting and selling tiny livers, lungs, and hearts of aborted unborn children that have led legislators to question continued taxpayer funding of Planned Parenthood,\u201d Sarah Torre, a policy analyst in the DeVos Center for Religion and Civil Society at The Heritage Foundation, told The Daily Signal.\n\n\u201cThe nation\u2019s largest abortion provider has also faced accusations of bad conduct in the past, including financial waste, abuse, and possible fraud with taxpayer dollars, and some have even been accused of failing to report the sexual abuse of minor girls.\u201d\n\nShe added:\n\nMeanwhile, cancer screening and preventative services have decreased at Planned Parenthood, even as the number of abortions affiliates perform each year has increased. Taxpayer money would be better spent at the many other health centers that provide a wide range of care for women without entanglement in abortion on demand.\n\nPresident Barack Obama vetoed a bill that would have put a one-year halt on federal taxpayer funding of Planned Parenthood. The House of Representatives failed to override the veto.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of momentum that\u2019s in states as well as in the Congress,\u201d Donovan said. \u201cThe states\u2019 actions indicate that even if Washington is tied up for the moment, states are still interested in going forward. They\u2019re doing it different ways, but they\u2019re getting it done.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "What's behind the recent momentum.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "What's behind the recent momentum.", "title": "Ten States Have Now Defunded Planned Parenthood", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160222_PPOhio_Jessen.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-23T17:38:36+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1Rjud7l"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "What's behind the recent momentum.", "title": "Ten States Have Now Defunded Planned Parenthood", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160222_PPOhio_Jessen.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "Protecting Life", "published_time": "2016-02-23T11:14:12+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-23T17:38:36+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Ohio, Planned Parenthood, John Kasich, Center for Medical Progress, Sarah Torre, Heritage Foundation, states, health centers, Casey Mattox, David Daleiden"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd5e16\"", "article_summary": "The legislation \u201cwill have devastating consequences for women across Ohio,\u201d Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America and Planned Parenthood Action Fund, said in a statement.\nA couple of states defunded Planned Parenthood well before the videos were released, Donovan says.\nPlanned Parenthood has fought other states\u2019 efforts to cut off its funding, arguing that its constitutional rights were being violated.\nAdding to the momentum to defund abortion giant Planned Parenthood, Ohio Gov.\nPresident Barack Obama vetoed a bill that would have put a one-year halt on federal taxpayer funding of Planned Parenthood."}
