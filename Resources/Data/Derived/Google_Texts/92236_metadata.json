(AP) - Cigarette maker Reynolds American Inc. is partnering with a pharmaceutical consultancy to develop products that help people stop smoking.\n\nThe nation\u2019s second-biggest tobacco company\u2019s agreement with Maryland-based Pinney Associates comes as tax increases, health concerns, smoking bans and social stigma cut into demand for cigarettes and more smokers try to quit.\n\nReynolds CEO Susan Cameron also has been vocal about the company\u2019s interest in transforming the tobacco industry with new products that can reduce the health impact of tobacco use. Reynolds will also be working with Pinney Associates on policies that aim to reduce the harmful effects of tobacco.\n\nSmoking is the leading cause of preventable illness and death in the U.S. and is responsible for the majority of the nation\u2019s lung cancer deaths. It\u2019s also a factor in heart attacks and a variety of illnesses. More than 42 million U.S. adults smoke cigarettes and about half try to quit every year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nAs part of the agreement, Reynolds American\u2019s Niconovum USA unit will partner with a Pinney affiliate to develop a new kind of nicotine gum and other nicotine-replacement products like electronic cigarettes. The Winston-Salem, North Carolina, company bought Niconovum, which makes nicotine gum, pouches and spray products, in 2009.\n\nThe maker of Camel and Pall Mall cigarettes is currently expanding its Zonnic brand nicotine gum nationwide, challenging the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s hold and pricing power of the market for products to help people stop smoking.\n\nPinney Associates has done extensive work for GlaxoSmithKline, the leading seller of nicotine gums, patches and other products that help people stop smoking. Its former employees include Mitch Zeller, who currently heads the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s tobacco regulatory efforts.\n\n\u201cWhile what we\u2019ve been doing in tobacco control is working, it\u2019s just not working fast enough,\u201d John Pinney, CEO of Pinney Associates, said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of people who I believe probably need nicotine for the rest of their lives and the goal here would be - if that\u2019s the case- let\u2019s get them a product that\u2019s not going to kill them.\u201d\n\nReynolds is deepening it is position in the market as the Food and Drug Administration has said that it\u2019s safe to use nicotine replacement products for longer than previously thought. In recent years, a number of stakeholders in public health have noted that smokers that are trying to quit would relapse if they stopped using the nicotine-replacement products after a suggested time period, and they\u2019d abandon their attempt to quit if they had a cigarette while using them, the agency said.\n\n___\n\nMichael Felberbaum can be reached at http://www.twitter.com/MLFelberbaum.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Cigarette maker Reynolds American Inc. is partnering with a pharmaceutical consultancy to develop products that help people stop smoking.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/feb/19/reynolds-american-delving-deeper-into-nicotine-gum/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "Cigarette maker Reynolds American Inc. is partnering with a pharmaceutical consultancy to develop products that help people stop smoking.", "title": "Reynolds American delving deeper into nicotine gum business"}, "twitter": {"description": "Cigarette maker Reynolds American Inc. is partnering with a pharmaceutical consultancy to develop products that help people stop smoking.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Reynolds American delving deeper into nicotine gum business"}, "Author": "MICHAEL FELBERBAUM", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca1a6\"", "article_summary": "Reynolds will also be working with Pinney Associates on policies that aim to reduce the harmful effects of tobacco.\nRICHMOND, Va.
