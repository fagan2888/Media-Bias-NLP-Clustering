Josey Hensley, R-Hohenwald, asked a judge to dismiss her order of protection against him last week.\n\nGina Hensley filed for the order of protection in Hohenwald, the Lewis County seat, after she claimed Hensley struck her with his car door. She said she lived in fear of her ex-husband\u2019s anger.\n\nHensley told WSMV-TV, a news partner of The Daily Herald, she dropped the order because of how difficult it\u2019s been on her children.\n\nThe senator issued a statement last week in response to his ex-wife\u2019s decision, saying he did not believe she dropped it because of the affect on the children.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thankful to be able to put this behind me,\u201d he wrote. \u201cGina has dropped her petition, but not because of the children. She was not concerned with the harm a divorce would cause our children or the harm this fabricated order of protection and the publicity surrounding it would cause our children. She dropped it because an independent witness came forward to testify that her story was false and even her own witnesses would not back up her accusations.\u201d\n\nHensley said the Lewis County district attorney and Tennessee Bureau of Investigation investigated her claims.\n\n\u201cShe was in real danger of being charged with making a false report, and that\u2019s why she dropped it,\u201d he said. \u201co far as the TBI investigation she mentioned, the TBI did a thorough investigation at the request of the district attorney, and they also found absolutely no basis for her claims.\n\n\u201cThe investigation is over and although I\u2019m happy to be fully vindicated, her false allegations have damaged my reputation. Domestic violence is a serious matter and the system designed to protect victims should not be able to be used by vindictive people that want to make someone look bad.\u201d\n\nHensley said there should be consequences for false reports and said he would never hurt another person.\n\n\u201cPeople who only know my name and not me personally probably have their doubts,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWhy would she make up a story like this if it wasn\u2019t true? I may never know for certain but I\u2019d imagine that she would like to have full custody of our children which we share jointly now, and that would, of course, mean more money from me.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve already given her plenty of money, and she even lives in another house that I own. I will always take care of my children and even in the short period of time we have not lived together I have continued to pay for things that I am not obligated to in the terms of our divorce.\u201d\n\nHensley said he did not want to divorce his ex-wife and said he wanted the marriage to stay together.\n\n\u201cI tried with all my heart to keep our family together. Gina and the children were my whole world. She began having an affair with a Lewis County High School teacher a few years ago. I may have been the last person in Lewis County to know about the affair, but when I found out I forgave her and continued to try to make our marriage work.\n\n\u201cWe continued to live together as husband and wife for several months after the divorce was final, and I kept hoping up until the day she left that she would change her mind about ripping our family apart for the sake of our children. She didn\u2019t. She took our children and lived with the teacher and his children for a few weeks. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s healthy for our children or any child to be in this kind of environment and I think most people would agree with me. Making up this story about me is her way of trying to justify the divorce.\u201d\n\nThe allegations have been difficult for the state senator, he said, but he plans to continue serving in 28th District seat.\n\n\u201cI am happy to put this behind me so I can concentrate on helping my children get through this difficult time and move on with my life,\u201d he said. \u201cI have been humbled by the outpouring of support from the people who know me and have come forward during this very difficult time to offer their encouragement.\n\n\u201cI will be eternally grateful to each and every one of them. I will continue to serve my constituents in the 28th District to the very best of my ability in the state Senate and appreciate their continued confidence in me.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The ex-wife of State Sen.
