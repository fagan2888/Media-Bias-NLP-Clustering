Kennedy's assassination, continuing problems with Obamacare websites across the nation, and ongoing strife in Syria. It's cheerful stuff! But in the meantime, at least there's the PlayStation vs. Xbox war to keep tabs on... and on that note, here are some of the most thought-y (is that a word, Mr. Colbert?) tweets I encountered this week.

With, in some cases, funny pictures.\n\nChristopher Sogohian of the ACLU remembered, amid the continuing fallout from the NSA's monitoring of American Internet traffic, that web surveillance\u2014and tech giants collaborating with the NSA\u2014has been going on for years.\n\nAcross the world, journalist Pedro da Costa caught this slice of human life at the European Parliament:\n\nScience writer Ed Yong then did the most nerd-riffic tribute ever to the late scientist Fred Sanger:\n\nComedian Hannibal Buress, meanwhile, added wit to health care:\n\nNew York Magazine book critic Kathryn Schulz then discovered the email auto-response we all secretly want:\n\nMeanwhile, Joy Reid of the Grio looked at George Zimmerman's latest felony charge.\n\nAnd MSNBC's Irin Carmon got all meta about Zimmerman:\n\nIn These Times writer Sady Doyle, meanwhile, tackled the thing everyone truly worries about: Clowns.\n\nRafat Ali of travel site Skift, with a single sceencap, captured the existential angst of business travel:\n\nOn a poignant note, New York City chief digital officer Rachel Haot posted this family connection to the JFK assassination:\n\nAnd startup founder Garrett Murray took a moment to think about the Zaprauder film:\n\nNewly minted television host Derrick Ashong explained how to befuddle immigration officials:\n\nMeanwhile in Afghanistan, the country's Loya Jirga (grand council) convened, and Twitter picked up some amazing\n\npictures:\n\nAcross the world, Al Jazeera's Latoya Peterson out-phableted the phablet:\n\nNew York journalist Amanda Marcotte stepped in to offer an alternate take on the Twitterati's discussion of selfies:\n\nAuthor Elif Batuman put the world's most highbrow funny animal picture on Twitter:\n\nTechie Anil Dash found a small-but-important change in Google's design:\n\nAOL discontinued beloved music player Winamp this week. Austin developer Adam Keys celebrated in the only appropriate way... with a llama joke.\n\nAnd Digg's David Weiner noted how everyone seems to be handling the theft of hundreds of thousands of Adobe passwords well... except for Adobe.\n\nCirca's Daniel Bentley then used Twitter to talk truth about Reddit.\n\nJess Silver Greenberg of the New York Times posted this incredible picture from the Times offices:\n\nAnd on a more serious note, the AFP's Prashant Rao bought some sad news from Iraq that is, depressingly, only getting worse.", "article_metadata": {"pubexchange": {"headline": "21 Of The Smartest People On Twitter This Week", "image": "http://c.fastcompany.net/multisite_files/fastcompany/imagecache/620x350/poster/2013/11/3022161-teaser-twitterbirdsketch.jpg", "description": "Fast Company reporter Neal Ungerleider shares some tweets from the wittiest and most thought-provoking people he came across on Twitter this week."}, "description": "Fast Company reporter Neal Ungerleider shares some tweets from the wittiest and most thought-provoking people he came across on Twitter this week.", "og": {"site_name": "Fast Company", "description": "Fast Company reporter Neal Ungerleider shares some tweets from the wittiest and most thought-provoking people he came across on Twitter this week.", "title": "21 Of The Smartest People On Twitter This Week", "url": "http://www.fastcompany.com/3022161/the-recommender/21-of-the-smartest-people-on-twitter-this-week", "image": "http://c.fastcompany.net/multisite_files/fastcompany/imagecache/620x350/poster/2013/11/3022161-teaser-twitterbirdsketch.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "fastcompany.com", "description": "Fast Company reporter Neal Ungerleider shares some tweets from the wittiest and most thought-provoking people he came across on Twitter this week.", "title": "21 Of The Smartest People On Twitter This Week", "url": "http://www.fastcompany.com/3022161/the-recommender/21-of-the-smartest-people-on-twitter-this-week", "image": "http://c.fastcompany.net/multisite_files/fastcompany/imagecache/620x350/poster/2013/11/3022161-teaser-twitterbirdsketch.jpg", "creator": "@nealunger", "site": "@FastCompany", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000062710915, "pages": 5942134076, "app_id": 178479832213933}, "keywords": "european parliament,internet traffic,travel site,web surveillance,business travel", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/FastCompany", "section": "The Recommender", "tag": "the recommender", "published_time": "2013-11-23T15:07:00.000Z", "modified_time": "2014-07-09T18:38:50.000Z"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdab4c\"", "article_summary": "And MSNBC's Irin Carmon got all meta about Zimmerman:In These Times writer Sady Doyle, meanwhile, tackled the thing everyone truly worries about: Clowns.\nCirca's Daniel Bentley then used Twitter to talk truth about Reddit.\nJess Silver Greenberg of the New York Times posted this incredible picture from the Times offices:And on a more serious note, the AFP's Prashant Rao bought some sad news from Iraq that is, depressingly, only getting worse.\ntweets I encountered this week.\nAnd Digg's David Weiner noted how everyone seems to be handling the theft of hundreds of thousands of Adobe passwords well... except for Adobe."}
