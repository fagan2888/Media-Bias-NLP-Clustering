Merry Christmas! Like yesterday, not much going on of course, but for those who do need plans…

The Maccabeats @ BB King’s

Jewish a cappella group The Maccabeats, who formed during their time at Yeshiva University, have gained some popularity due to their Jewish-themed parodies of popular songs, and tonight they do their annual Christmas Day show at BB King’s.

John Zorn Improv Night @ The Stone

The Stone’s artistic director John Zorn begins his annual end-of-the-year improv residency at the venue, which runs through December 29. For tonight’s show he’ll be joined by Ikue Mori, Ches Smith, Uri Caine, Chuck Bettis, Nonoko Yoshida, David Watson, Sylvie Courvoisier, Mark Feldman, and Chris Otto.

Union Hall is open with Christmas-themed drinks, bocce ball, and their fireplace going. No music though.

For all of tonight’s shows, and tomorrow’s, check out our full NYC show calendar.

For laughs, check out the NYC Comedy calendar too.
