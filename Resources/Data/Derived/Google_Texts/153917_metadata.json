Bush, imperialism, Military-industrial complex, News, Politics News\n\nThe United States unique today among major states in the degree of its reliance on military spending and its determination to stand astride the world, militarily as well as economically. No other country in the post\u2013Second World War world has been so globally destructive or inflicted so many war fatalities. Since 2001, acknowledged U.S. national defense spending has increased by almost 60 percent in real dollar terms to a level in 2007 of $553 billion. This is higher than at any point since the Second World War (though lower than previous decades as a percentage of GDP). Based on such official figures, the United States is reported by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) as accounting for 45 percent of world military expenditures. Yet, so gargantuan and labyrinthine are U.S. military expenditures that their true magnitude reached $1 trillion in 2007. Externally, these are necessary expenditures of world empire. Internally, they represent, as Michal Kalecki was the first to suggest, an imperial triangle of state-financed military production, media propaganda, and real/imagined economic-employment effects that has become a deeply entrenched and self-perpetuating feature of the U.S. social order. Many analysts today view the present growth of U.S. militarism and imperialism as largely divorced from the earlier Cold War history of the United States, which was commonly seen as a response to the threat represented by the Soviet Union. Placed against this backdrop the current turn to war and war preparation appears to numerous commentators to lack a distinct target, despite concerns about global terrorism, and to be mainly the product of irrational hubris on the part of U.S. leaders. Even as insightful a left historian as Eric Hobsbawm has recently adopted this general perspective. Thus in his 2008 book On Empire Hobsbawm writes:\n\nFrankly, I can\u2019t make sense of what has happened in the United States since 9/11 that enabled a group of political crazies to realize long-held plans for an unaccompanied solo performance of world supremacy. . . . Today a radical right-wing regime seeks to mobilize \u201ctrue Americans\u201d against some evil outside force and against a world that does not recognize the uniqueness, the superiority, the manifest destiny of America. . . . In effect, the most obvious danger of war today arises from the global ambitions of an uncontrollable and apparently irrational government in Washington. . . . To give America the best chance of learning to return from megalomania to rational foreign policy is the most immediate and urgent task of international politics. Such a view, which sees the United States as under the influence of a new irrationalism introduced by George W. Bush and a cabal of neoconservative \u201cpolitical crazies,\u201d and consequently calls for a return from \u201cmegalomania to rational foreign policy,\u201d downplays the larger historical and structural forces at work that connect the Cold War and post\u2013Cold War imperial eras. In contrast, a more realistic perspective, I believe, can be obtained by looking at the origins of the U.S. \u201cmilitary ascendancy\u201d (as C. Wright Mills termed it) in the early Cold War years and the centrality this has assumed in the constitution of the U.S. empire and economy up to the present. The Permanent War Economy and Military Keynesianism In January 1944 Charles E. Wilson, president of General Electric and executive vice chairman of the War Production Board, delivered a speech to the Army Ordnance Association advocating a permanent war economy. According to the plan Wilson proposed on that occasion, every major corporation should have a \u201cliaison\u201d representative with the military, who would be given a commission as a colonel in the Reserve. This would form the basis of a program, to be initiated by the president as commander-in-chief in cooperation with the War and Navy departments, designed to bind corporations and the military together into a single unified armed forces\u2013industrial complex. \u201cWhat is more natural and logical,\u201d he asked, \u201cthan that we should henceforth mount our national policy upon the solid fact of an industrial capacity for war, and a research capacity for war that is already \u2018in being\u2019? It seems to me anything less is foolhardy.\u201d Wilson went on to indicate that in this plan the part to be played by Congress was restricted to voting for the needed funds. Further, it was essential that industry be allowed to play its central role in this new warfare state without being hindered politically \u201cor thrown to the fanatical isolationist fringe [and] tagged with a \u2018merchants-of-death\u2019 label.\u201d\n\nIn calling even before the Second World War had come to a close for a \u201ccontinuing program of industrial preparedness\u201d for war, Charles E. Wilson (sometimes referred to as \u201cGeneral Electric Wilson\u201d to distinguish him from \u201cGeneral Motors Wilson\u201d\u2014Charles Erwin Wilson, president of General Motors and Eisenhower\u2019s secretary of defense) was articulating a view that was to characterize the U.S. oligarchy as a whole during the years immediately following the Second World War. In earlier eras it had been assumed that there was an economic \u201cguns and butter\u201d trade-off, and that military spending had to occur at the expense of other sectors of the economy. However, one of the lessons of the economic expansion in Nazi Germany, followed by the experience of the United States itself in arming for the Second World War, was that big increases in military spending could act as huge stimulants to the economy. In just six years under the influence of the Second World War, the U.S. economy expanded by 70 percent, finally recovering from the Great Depression. The early Cold War era thus saw the emergence of what later came to be known as \u201cmilitary Keynesianism\u201d: the view that by promoting effective demand and supporting monopoly profits military spending could help place a floor under U.S. capitalism. John Maynard Keynes, in his landmark General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money, published in 1936, in the midst of the Depression, argued that the answer to economic stagnation was to promote effective demand through government spending. The bastardized Keynesianism that came to be known as \u201cmilitary Keynesianism\u201d was the view that this was best effected with the least negative consequences for big business by focusing on military spending. As Joan Robinson, one of Keynes\u2019s younger colleagues, critically explained in her iconoclastic lecture, \u201cThe Second Crisis of Economic Theory,\u201d before the American Economic Association on December 27, 1971:\n\nThe most convenient thing for a government to spend on is armaments. The military-industrial complex [thus] took charge. I do not think it plausible to suppose that the Cold War and several hot wars were invented just to solve the employment problem. But certainly they have had that effect. The system had the support not only of the corporations who make profits under it and the workers who got jobs, but also of the economists who advocated government loan-expenditure as a prophylactic against stagnation. Whatever were the deeper forces leading to the hypertrophy of military power after the world war was over, certainly they could not have had such free play if the doctrine of sound finance had still been respected. It was the so-called Keynesians who persuaded successive Presidents that there is no harm in a budget deficit and left the military-industrial complex to take advantage of it. So it has come about that Keynes\u2019 pleasant daydream was turned into a nightmare of terror. The first to theorize this tendency toward military Keynesianism under monopoly capitalism was the Polish economist Michal Kalecki (most famous, as Robinson pointed out in the above-mentioned lecture, for having discovered the essentials of Keynes\u2019s General Theory before Keynes himself). In a 1943 essay on \u201cThe Political Aspects of Full Employment\u201d and in subsequent essays, Kalecki argued that monopoly capital had a deep aversion to increased civilian government spending due to its intrusion on the commodity market and the sphere of private profit, but that this did not apply in the same way to military spending, which was seen by the vested interests as adding to, rather than crowding out, profits. If absorption of the massive economic surplus of large corporate capital through increased government spending was the key to accumulation in post\u2013Second World War U.S. capitalism, this was dependent principally on military expenditures, or what Kalecki in 1956 labeled \u201cthe armament-imperialist complex.\u201d This resulted in a \u201chigh degree of utilization\u201d of productive capacity and \u201ccounteracted the disrupting influence of the increase in the relative share of accumulation of big business in the national product.\u201d\n\nFor Kalecki this new military-supported regime of accumulation that came to characterize U.S. monopoly capital by the mid-1950s established a strong political-economic foundation for its own rule \u201cbased on the following [imperial] triangle\u201d: Imperialism contributes to a relatively high level of employment through expenditures on armaments and ancillary purposes and through the maintenance of a large body of armed forces and government employees. The mass communications media, working under the auspices of the ruling class, emits propaganda aimed at securing the support of the population for this armament-imperialist setup. The high level of employment and the standard of living increased considerably as compared with before the war (as a result of the rise in the productivity of labor), and this facilitated the absorption of this propaganda to the broad masses of the population. Mass communication occupied a central place in this imperial triangle. An essential part of Kalecki\u2019s argument was that \u201cthe mass communication media, such as the daily press, radio, and television in the United States, are largely under the control of the ruling class.\u201d As none other than Charles E. (General Electric) Wilson, then defense mobilization director, put it in a speech to the American Newspaper Publishers Association on April 26, 1951, the job of the media was to bring \u201cpublic opinion, as marshaled by the press\u201d to the support of the permanent war effort (italics added). The result by the mid-1950s was a fairly stable militarized economy, in which intertwined imperial, political-economic, and communication factors all served to reinforce the new military-imperial order. Kalecki observed that U.S. trade unions were \u201cpart and parcel of the armament-imperialist setup. Workers in the United States are not duller and trade union leaders are not more reactionary \u2018by nature\u2019 than in other capitalist countries. Rather, the political situation in the United States is simply, in accordance with the precepts of historical materialism, the unavoidable consequence of economic developments and of characteristics of the superstructure of monopoly capitalism in its advanced stage.\u201d All of this pointed to what Harry Magdoff was to call the essential \u201cone-ness of national security and business interests\u201d that came to characterize the U.S. political economy and empire.\n\nMany of Kalecki\u2019s ideas were developed further by Paul Baran and Paul Sweezy in 1966 in Monopoly Capital. Baran and Sweezy argued there were at least five political-economic-imperial ends propelling the U.S. oligarchy in the 1950s and \u201960s toward the creation of a massive military establishment: (1) defending U.S. global hegemony and the empire of capital against external threats in the form of a wave of revolutions erupting throughout the world, simplistically viewed in terms of a monolithic Communist threat centered in the Soviet Union; (2) creating an internationally \u201csecure\u201d platform for U.S. corporations to expand and monopolize economic opportunities abroad; (3) forming a government-sponsored research and development sector that would be dominated by big business; (4) generating a more complacent population at home, made less recalcitrant under the nationalistic influence of perpetual war and war preparation; and (5) soaking up the nation\u2019s vast surplus productive capacity, thus helping to stave off economic stagnation, through the promotion of high-profit, low-risk (to business) military spending. The combined result of such political-economic-imperial factors was the creation of the largest, most deeply entrenched and persistent \u201cpeacetime\u201d war machine that the world had ever seen. Like Kalecki, Baran and Sweezy argued that the U.S. oligarchy kept a \u201ctight rein on civilian [government] spending,\u201d which, they suggested, \u201chad about reached its outer limits\u201d as a percentage of national income \u201cby 1939,\u201d but was nonetheless \u201copen-handed with the military.\u201d Government pump-priming operations therefore occurred largely through spending on wars and war preparations in the service of empire. The Pentagon naturally made sure that bases and armaments industries were spread around the United States and that numerous corporations profited from military spending, thus maximizing congressional support due to the effects on states and districts.", "article_metadata": {"description": "While our 43rd president rightly takes blame for his disastrous failed wars, there's much more blame to go around", "title": "America\u2019s dark imperial legacy: It goes much deeper than George W.
