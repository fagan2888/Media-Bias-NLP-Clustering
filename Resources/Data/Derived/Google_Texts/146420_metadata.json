Even without health insurance coverage to lean on, Lepley said the entire cost \u2014 surgery and trip combined \u2014 was much lower than the price he had paid five years ago when his right hip was replaced in the United States.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s (financial savings) the most important thing,\u201d said Lepley. \u201cThis place was just unbelievable \u2014 the quality of care, the quality of facilities, equipment, the nurses, the technicians, food \u2013 everything\u2019s been top notch.\u201d\n\nCounting on Americans\n\nDr. Devi Prasad Shetty, famed heart surgeon and Mother Teresa\u2019s personal physician, is the brain trust behind the idea to bring high-quality, low-cost medicine to the Cayman Islands and Central and South American outposts.\n\nSince opening earlier this year, Health City Cayman has put the tiny island of just 55,000 residents on the international map for more than Stingray City or Seven Mile Beach. Once complete, Health City will house 2,000 beds, a medical research team and an assisted-living center to form one of the largest healthcare complexes in the Caribbean for cardiac surgery, cardiology, orthopedics, pediatrics, endocrinology and pulmonology.\n\nDr. Devi Prsad Shetty, renowned heart surgeon for Mother Theresa and brain trust behind the idea to bring high-quality, low-cost medicine to the Cayman Islands and Central and South American outposts, believes these services can sustain a major medical center on the island. Health officials in the Caymans concur. But, they are counting on Americans, many of whom bought insurance through the Affordable Care Act\u2019s federal and state exchanges, to foot a good portion of the bill\n\nAnalysts say deductibles for Americans who purchased Obamacare plans can top $5,000 for individuals and $10,000 for families. Faced with the prospect of substantial price increases next year or the inconvenience of changing plans, many of these 7.3 million Americans might not hesitate to forgo the high out-of-pocket costs and make the one-hour flight to the Cayman Islands for affordable care instead.\n\n\u201cHigh deductibles can cover the costs of severe illnesses and lengthy hospital stays, but even for those insured, costs associated with elective procedures can be jaw-dropping,\u201d said Ren\u00e9e-Marie Stephano, President of the Medical Tourism Association\u00ae. \u201cPeople may be influenced to shop around for alternatives. Fortunately, after a little research and planning, Americans with marketplace coverage can find low-cost procedures overseas that are backed by international accreditation, quality assurance and the transparency of outcomes.\u201d\n\nKnowledge is Power (Click Here for Related Article)\n\nRen\u00e9e-Marie Stephano, President of the Medical Tourism Association\u00ae, says certified training and education will be a matter of necessity for Health City Cayman Islands to sustain its place as a destination for medical travel.\n\nStephano said the proximity of the Cayman Islands to the United States and international recognition as a tourist destination gives Health City a leg up on the competition for medical travel dollars in the Caribbean. But, those attributes alone won\u2019t guarantee sustained success.\n\n\u201cBeautiful beaches and a Caribbean-style vacation can only go so far to attract international patients,\u201d said Stephano. \u201cCompetition for international patients is stiff. Savvy healthcare consumers with an eye toward travel have raised the bar on the quality of care they expect and the standards they seek. Ongoing education and training is certainly a critical factor for medical tourism patients to consider and a matter of necessity for healthcare providers to complete.\u201d\n\nStephano said the Medical Tourism Association\u00ae is working with the government of Puerto Rico to implement a training program that will not only improve facility and professional standards on the island, but the overall patient experience as well.\n\n\u201dOne poor patient experience \u2013 surgical outcomes on down to the selection of food \u2014 can hamper the reputation of a hospital and destination,\u201d said Cristina Cardona, executive global program manager at the Medical Tourism Association\u00ae. \u201cAirport-to-hotel transfers, lodging accommodations, translator services at the hospital, menus that are sensitive to cultural habits and sightseeing offerings are all components of the medical tourism package that only the proper training and education can identify, evaluate, and improve upon.\u201d\n\nIsland Welcome\n\nAmericans are far from strangers to the Cayman Islands. Situated 480 miles south of Miami, Fla., the popular Caribbean vacation destination offers plenty of natural beauty, fine dining, shopping, outdoor activities, nightlife and historic sightseeing. Sun, sand and surf is further complemented by the evolution of Health City, which will break ground next year on a hotel to lodge overseas patients and housing for rehabilitation facilities.\n\nDr. Chandy Abraham, Health City\u2019s facility and medical director who spoke this year at the World Medical Tourism & Global Healthcare Congress, says bundled flat rates are appealing to medical travel patients.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re one of the few hospitals in the world to publish our prices as a bundled flat rate,\u201d said Chandy Abraham, M.D., Health City\u2019s facility and medical director who boasted about the strategy to delegates at the World Medical Tourism & Global Healthcare Congress, earlier this year, in Washington, D.C. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what you\u2019ll pay, nothing more. You get one bill and you\u2019ll never get another bill. It\u2019s a model that gets a lot of attention when we talk with other healthcare providers.\u201d\n\nSince construction commenced 12 months ago, that model has grown to include complex procedures, such as open-heart surgery for about $2,000 \u2014 substantially less than other medical tourism hospitals in India charge and a fraction of the $20,000 to $100,000 cost found in the United States. Health City officials say aligning a caring and responsive environment with affordable costs is job one.\n\n\u201cThe goal is to continuously reduce the cost so everyone can afford [care],\u201d said Shomari Scott, Health City\u2019s marketing director, during a Caribbean Summit for government officials at the World Medical Tourism & Global Healthcare Congress. \u201cThe funny thing is medical tourism is going to be the by-product.\u201d\n\nElsa Robinson wasn\u2019t laughing when her cardiologist told her she needed an angiogram to determine if the arteries in her heart were blocked.\n\n\u201cNormally, they send you overseas for an angiogram, but because Health City is open, they referred me over there,\u201d said the 65-year-old woman who no longer feels the pain in her chest after becoming the first local resident to undergo open-heart surgery on the island.\n\nGovernment Assistance\n\nOnce complete, Health City will house 2,000 beds, a medical research team and an assisted-living center to form one of the largest healthcare complexes in the Caribbean for cardiac surgery, cardiology, orthopedics, pediatrics, endocrinology and pulmonology.\n\nFrom the onset, the Cayman government has worked alongside Health City in a broader effort to create jobs and diversify the island\u2019s economy, which ranks 14th among the world\u2019s nations for standard of living. To lure Health City \u2013 a project backed by India-based Narayana Health and Ascension Health, the largest private not-for-profit health system in the United States \u2013 authorities offered the \u201codd partnership\u201d deals ranging from lower malpractice caps and amended employment laws to waivers on import taxes on medical equipment and for work permits fees. Critics contend these incentives and concessions could shift the competitive balance against local healthcare providers.\n\nThat hasn\u2019t stopped the government from designating additional medical travel providers including Seven Mile Medical, Harmonic Consultants Health Care, Perseus PCI and the Da Vinci Centre for Wellness and Alternative Therapies to open up shop near Health City in the tourism district of George Town.\n\nRic Walton is among those glad to see these services are available for vacationers, too. The American tourist from Colorado was on a ferry boat to Stingray City when he collapsed. When the boat returned to shore, Walton was immediately transported to Health City.\n\n\u201cThe people have been so kind and faithful,\u201d said Charlotte Walton as she watched her husband discharge from Health City, her voice wavering as she recalled how her son and daughter-in-law kept him and their \u201cdream vacation\u201d alive with CPR and mouth-to-mouth resuscitation until cardiologists could intervene. \u201cWe\u2019ve just been very blessed.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Health City Cayman Island is counting on American medical tourism patients to find more than sun, surf and sand on the popular destination in the Caribbean.", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Tourism Magazine | Blog", "description": "Ort ...", "title": "Cayman Islands Health City: At Heart of Medical Tourism in Caribbean", "url": "http://www.medicaltourismmag.com/blog/2014/12/cayman-islands-heart-medical-tourism-caribbean/", "image": "http://www.medicaltourismmag.com/news/wp-content/uploads/cayman-islands.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Health City Cayman Island is counting on American medical tourism patients to find more than sun, surf and sand on the popular destination in the Caribbean.", "creator": "@Medtour", "image": "http://www.medicaltourismmag.com/news/wp-content/uploads/cayman-islands.jpg", "title": "Cayman Islands: At Heart of Medical Tourism in Caribbean", "site": "@MedTourMagazine", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 578485882245508}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Author: Joe HarkinsOrthopedic surgeons at Health City Cayman Islands replaced the hip of American medical tourism patient Michael Lepley.\nDr. Chandy Abraham, Health City\u2019s facility and medical director who spoke this year at the World Medical Tourism & Global Healthcare Congress, says bundled flat rates are appealing to medical travel patients.\n\u201cThe funny thing is medical tourism is going to be the by-product.\u201dElsa Robinson wasn\u2019t laughing when her cardiologist told her she needed an angiogram to determine if the arteries in her heart were blocked.\n\u201dOne poor patient experience \u2013 surgical outcomes on down to the selection of food \u2014 can hamper the reputation of a hospital and destination,\u201d said Cristina Cardona, executive global program manager at the Medical Tourism Association\u00ae.\n\u201cHigh deductibles can cover the costs of severe illnesses and lengthy hospital stays, but even for those insured, costs associated with elective procedures can be jaw-dropping,\u201d said Ren\u00e9e-Marie Stephano, President of the Medical Tourism Association\u00ae."}
