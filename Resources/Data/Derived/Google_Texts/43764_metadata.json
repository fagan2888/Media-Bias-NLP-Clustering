But Jesse Watters went a step further in announcing that he doesn\u2019t think the tactics revealed in the report constitute torture.\n\nOne of the major takeaways from the Senate torture report is, as Think Progress noted, \u201cthe torture methods were far more brutal than originally reported.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cCIA applied its so-called enhanced interrogation techniques in near non-stop fashion for days or weeks at a time.\u201d Detainees were forced to stay awake for up to 180 hours while \u201cstanding or in painful stress positions, at times with their hands shackled above their heads.\u201d Some were kept in a \u201cdungeon\u201d that was completely dark and were \u201cconstantly shackled in isolated cells with loud noise or music and only a bucket to use for human waste. \u201d At least one detainee was told he could only leave CIA custody \u201cin a coffin-shaped box.\u201d The government also rectally force-fed detainees.\n\nBut Watters, today\u2019s #OneLuckyGuy on Outnumbered, said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to know about it. People do nasty things in the dark, especially after a terrorist attack.\u201d Apparently more interesting to him was the \u201cironic\u201d (as he saw it) fact that the report was released on the same day Jonathan Gruber testified about ObamaCare. Watters concluded \u2013 without offering a scintilla of evidence that the report was released today \u201cto knock that out of the front pages.\u201d\n\nWatters also concluded that the report was not likely true and that Senate Democrats are \u201cjust trying to get one last shot in at Bush before they go into the minority.\u201d He added, \u201cI\u2019m just not buying it.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve been very critical of co-host Kennedy in the past. But I applaud her for withstanding the Fox News party line here. She said, \u201cWe\u2019re the United States of America. We\u2019re better than this.\u201d Kennedy also said we\u2019re strong enough to have \u201cthis level of discourse and transparency. \u2026To say that this is somehow going to lead to death and destruction imminently is really irresponsible and they\u2019re just trying to shift that narrative which I fully disagree with.\u201d\n\nWatters interrupted her to say, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s torture. I do not think it's torture\u201d\n\nWell, of course he wouldn\u2019t. This is the guy who stalks and harasses women in his \"reporting\" and runs a Fox website that caters to people who would like to see Ferguson protesters lynched and salivate for the death of President Obama - among others.\n\nNot surprisingly, co-host Andrea Tantaros also made the report about politics. This is the woman who urged her radio show listeners to \u201cdo me a favor\u201d and punch an Obama supporter in the face. One would expect a woman with those kinds of scruples to support torture, too.\n\n\u201cThe Bush administration did what the American public wanted and that was do whatever it takes to keep us safe,\u201d Tantaros began. Then \u201cPunch\u201d offered up her special brand of analysis to co-host Harris Faulkner: \u201cIt\u2019s about Democrats being so fundamentally lost as a party, Harris, they have to return to an old playbook, the plays that they ran right when Obama got into office, trying to prosecute CIA officials for these terror tactics. And that same playbook that they feel got them the House of Representatives back, even under Tom DeLay\u2019s electoral map. \u2026It\u2019s how they win elections. \u2026They have nothing else to talk about and they don\u2019t want to talk about Gruber or health care or the IRS or anything else.\u201d\n\nYeah, right. Releasing the report a few weeks after the midterm elections, with nearly two full years to go before the presidential is so obviously an electoral stunt, it can only be that the rest of the media is so liberal, they didn\u2019t see the writing on the wall right away.\n\nWatch it below, via Media Matters.", "article_metadata": {"csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "google-site-verification": "google51c0b549f514d464.html", "csrf-token": "wX9vJ7G2nAO1hxRKeBYvpqXg8zCEhrauB+/f5ZG03PY=", "og": {"url": "http://www.newshounds.us/fox_s_jesse_watters_i_don_t_think_it_s_torture_120914", "type": "article", "image": "http://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/newshounds/sites/1/meta_images/original/Newshound3_blue.png?1327001871", "site_name": "NewsHounds", "title": "Fox\u2019s Jesse Watters: \u2018I Don\u2019t Think It\u2019s Torture\u2019"}, "Title": "Fox\u2019s Jesse Watters: \u2018I Don\u2019t Think It\u2019s Torture\u2019"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf0a3\"", "article_summary": "But Jesse Watters went a step further in announcing that he doesn\u2019t think the tactics revealed in the report constitute torture.\nOn today\u2019s Outnumbered, two Fox News hosts tried to diminish the Senate torture report by accusing the Democrats of releasing it to distract from ObamaCare.\nBut Watters, today\u2019s #OneLuckyGuy on Outnumbered, said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to know about it.\n\u2026To say that this is somehow going to lead to death and destruction imminently is really irresponsible and they\u2019re just trying to shift that narrative which I fully disagree with.\u201dWatters interrupted her to say, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s torture.\n\u2026They have nothing else to talk about and they don\u2019t want to talk about Gruber or health care or the IRS or anything else.\u201dYeah, right."}
