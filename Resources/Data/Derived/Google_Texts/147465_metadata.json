Glenn Cohen, a health-policy specialist at Harvard Law School. \u201cI do think, though, if it stays the course, that in 30 years this will be like Medicare, a controversial initiative that was not much loved or understood but has now become a cherished element of America\u2019s social safety net, for better or worse.\u201d\n\nRoughly half of the Pew respondents who disapprove of the law \u2014 27 percent of all respondents \u2014 thought lawmakers \u201cshould do what they can to make the law work as well as possible,\u201d while the other half, or 23 percent overall, said they should do what they can to make it fail.\n\nIn two weeks, Americans without employer-based coverage will begin to enroll on state-based insurance markets, where they will shop for coverage, often with the help of income-based government subsidies.\n\nThen, in January, half of the states are slated to expand Medicaid enrollment with the help of new federal funding.\n\nBut hard-line conservatives on Capitol Hill, backed by political advocacy groups such as the Club for Growth and Heritage Action, want to thwart the law before Americans get a taste of it.\n\nSenate Republicans have tied their opposition to the law into debate over an energy bill under consideration this week. They\u2019ve filed six amendments that would mirror votes in the Republican-led House that would delay or disrupt the law, or prevent the Obama administration from handing out dispensations from the law to members of Congress or labor unions.\n\nSen. Charles E. Schumer, New York Democrat, argued Friday that few people want Congress to put its work agenda on hold to take down the health care law.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on here \u2014 and I\u2019ve never seen anything quite like this \u2014 is, this small few who represent maybe 5 percent of the electorate dictate what\u2019s going on, hold the country by the neck and paralyze things,\u201d he said. \u201cThe good news is, we do have elections. And if they succeed in their platform, they will fail the way Mitt Romney failed.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "More than half of the American public holds a negative view of the new health care law, even though many do not fully understand how it will affect them and even fewer want lawmakers to help it fail, new polling shows.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/sep/16/poll-finds-more-share-negative-view-of-obamacare/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "More than half of the American public holds a negative view of the new health care law, even though many do not fully understand how it will affect them and even fewer want lawmakers to help it fail, new polling shows.", "title": "Poll finds more share negative view of Obamacare"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "description": "More than half of the American public holds a negative view of the new health care law, even though many do not fully understand how it will affect them and even fewer want lawmakers to help it fail,", "card": "summary", "title": "Poll finds more share negative view of Obamacare"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "Sen.
