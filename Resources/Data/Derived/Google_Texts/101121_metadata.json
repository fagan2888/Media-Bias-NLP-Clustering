On Monday, HHS released a guidance clarifying that the centers can offer these reduced fees to patients with incomes under 200% of the federal poverty level.Of the 7.3 million people who purchased and paid for coverage on the federal and states exchanges for 2014, about 20% selected bronze-tier plans, which feature deductibles as high as $5,500 a person. Those plans lack a key affordability feature of silver plans, which generally have higher premiums. Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, people with incomes of up to 250% of the federal poverty level who buy silver plans qualify for cost-sharing subsidies that reduce their out-of-pocket costs for care. Purchasers of bronze plans do not qualify for those subsidies.While all health plans that comply with Obamacare standards must cover a range of primary-care and preventive services on a first-dollar basis, deductibles and coinsurance apply when patients are diagnosed and treated for sickness, injuries or chronic illness.\u201cWith the Affordable Care Act, while the number of uninsured may be dropping, there's a new challenge in that there is now a huge cadre of underinsured people,\u201d said Sara Rosenbaum, chair of the health policy department at George Washington University.When the ACA was enacted, leaders of community health centers were excited about the prospect of their previously uninsured patients getting coverage and having their levels of uncompensated care drop. But they were surprised when many of their lower-income patients bought bronze plans with high cost-sharing and started coming in seeking treatment on a sliding-scale fee basis. Previously, sliding-scale fees were used mostly by uninsured people who had to pay their own bills.The centers say this has had a negative impact of their finances. \u201cThe use of the sliding fee scale due to the inability to pay required co-pays impacts the community health centers' uncompensated-care costs, which are not declining as rapidly as contemplated by some policymakers,\u201d said Mary Leath, CEO of Community Health Centers of Arkansas.The squeeze is being felt even in states that have expanded Medicaid to adults with incomes up to 138% of poverty, which has provided community health centers in those states with more paying patients. Deb Polun, director of government affairs at the Community Health Center Association of Connecticut, said the lowest deductibles for bronze plans in her state are about $4,000, which is not affordable for lower-income patients.\u201cSo some people with these plans are reluctant to get healthcare at all,\u201d Polun said. \u201cThose who do go to a federally qualified health center are typically still in their deductible window, and therefore they are essentially uninsured as far as the (community health center) is concerned.\u201dEven if a community health center gets a flood of new Medicaid patients, uncompensated cost could remain steady or even worsen. That's because the center is then subsidizing both the bronze plan patients who need sliding-scale fees and the Medicaid patients whose coverage pays low rates, said Eva Turbiner, CEO of Zufall Health Center in Morristown, N.J.People who buy silver-tier plans qualify for cost-sharing subsidies that cover up to an average of 94% of all costs. Navigators and other enrollment helpers have tried to steer people to silver rather than bronze plans for that reason, explaining that the higher premiums are offset by the subsidies and resulting lower out-of-pocket costs when people actually seek care.But because many lower-income people still bought bronze plans with high cost-sharing, they \u201care going to safety net clinics or community health centers and pretending they don't have insurance, and trying to get free or reduced cost care,\u201d said Katherine Hempstead, health insurance policy director at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.During the upcoming 2015 open-enrollment period starting Nov. 15, more work needs to be done to raise awareness among lower-income consumers that there are serious downsides to picking a plan just because it has the lowest premium, said Stephen Davidson, professor of health policy and management at the Boston University School of Management.\u201cMany people do not understand the cost-sharing element of their policy and are surprised the first time they go for services and find they are not covered because the deductible has not been met,\u201d Davidson said. \u201cSomething to watch in the new benefit year is the extent to which those folks switch plans.\u201dFollow Virgil Dickson on Twitter: @MHVDickson", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#0a365e", "description": "Obamacare enrollees are straining the finances of community health centers around the country, some health center leaders say.", "title": "Underinsured ACA enrollees strain community health centers", "og": {"site_name": "Modern Healthcare", "description": "Obamacare enrollees are straining the finances of community health centers around the country, some health center leaders say.", "title": "Community health centers are being strained by underinsured ACA enrollees", "url": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20140925/NEWS/309259947", "image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modernhealthcare/mh-logo/master/mh-logo-fb-lg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com", "description": "Obamacare enrollees are straining the finances of community health centers around the country, some health center leaders say.", "creator": "@modrnhealthcr", "image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modernhealthcare/mh-logo/master/mh-logo-twitter.jpg", "title": "Community health centers are being strained by underinsured ACA enrollees", "site": "@modrnhealthcr", "card": "summary"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Modern Healthcare", "published_at": "2014-09-25", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "url": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20140925/NEWS/309259947", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "msapplication-TileImage": "https:/raw.githubusercontent.com/modernhealthcare/mh-logo/master/ms-touch-icon-144x144-precomposed.png", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modernhealthcare/mh-logo/master/mh-logo-g-plus.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd18ac\"", "article_summary": "But they were surprised when many of their lower-income patients bought bronze plans with high cost-sharing and started coming in seeking treatment on a sliding-scale fee basis.\nThose plans lack a key affordability feature of silver plans, which generally have higher premiums.\n\u201cSomething to watch in the new benefit year is the extent to which those folks switch plans.\u201dFollow Virgil Dickson on Twitter: @MHVDickson\n\u201cThose who do go to a federally qualified health center are typically still in their deductible window, and therefore they are essentially uninsured as far as the (community health center) is concerned.\u201dEven if a community health center gets a flood of new Medicaid patients, uncompensated cost could remain steady or even worsen.\nPreviously, sliding-scale fees were used mostly by uninsured people who had to pay their own bills.The centers say this has had a negative impact of their finances."}
