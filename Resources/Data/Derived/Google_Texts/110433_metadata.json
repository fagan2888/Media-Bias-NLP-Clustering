Apparently one Michigan union, Operating Engineers Local 324, is publishing a quarterly \u201cFreeloaders List\u201d of the names of those who opt out of union membership and their place of work, NRO reports.\n\nThat puts non-union workers at increased risk of intimidation and violence\u2014something that\u2019s certainly not unprecedented in Michigan. Regardless, there\u2019s currently no law preventing unions such as Michigan\u2019s Local 324 from publishing lists of members who opt out, says Richard Berman, executive director of the Center for Union Facts.\n\nThe unions argue it\u2019s not fair that they are forced to represent workers who don\u2019t pay dues. This \u2018freeloading\u2019 claim is deceptive, however, because unions actually chose to offer representation to both paying and non-paying members in contract negotiations, Patrick Semmens, vice president of the National Right to Work Foundation, explained to NRO.\n\nUnions want to represent all workers regardless of membership status because it affords them greater rights under federal law. Such monopoly-representation unions can force an employer to come to the bargaining table, for example, or file a case with the National Labor Relations Board claiming the employer has failed to bargain in good faith. If a union chose to represent only those workers who pay dues, they would lose these and other powers.\n\n\u201cIn every state, unions fight for and are glad to have monopoly representation, so it\u2019s sort of crocodile tears when they complain about it,\u201d Semmens told NRO. \u201cThe complaint [about \u201cfreeloading\u201d] is something they trot out when it comes to right-to-work, but in reality, monopoly bargaining is something they very much favor.\u201d\n\nH/T: WeaselZippers", "article_metadata": {"description": "You didn\u2019t think Michigan\u2019s labor unions would let right to work laws pass without enacting some sort of retribution, did you? .05/24/2016 11:02:59AM EST.", "author": "Leah Barkoukis", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "You didn\u2019t think Michigan\u2019s labor unions would let right to work laws pass without enacting some sort of retribution, did you?", "title": "Leah Barkoukis - Michigan Union Publishes \u2018Freeloaders\u2019 List of Workers Who Opted Out", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/leahbarkoukis/2014/02/13/michigan-union-publishes-freeloaders-list-n1794694", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2013/345/2013-12-11T224850Z_1_CBRE9BA1RDJ00_RTROPTP_3_USA-MICHIGAN-UNIONS.JPG", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "You didn\u2019t think Michigan\u2019s labor unions would let right to work laws pass without enacting some sort of retribution, did you?", "title": "Leah Barkoukis - Michigan Union Publishes \u2018Freeloaders\u2019 List of Workers Who Opted Out", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/leahbarkoukis/2014/02/13/michigan-union-publishes-freeloaders-list-n1794694", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2013/345/2013-12-11T224850Z_1_CBRE9BA1RDJ00_RTROPTP_3_USA-MICHIGAN-UNIONS.JPG", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Michigan Union Publishes \u2018Freeloaders\u2019 List of Workers Who Opted Out , Leah Barkoukis, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd290f\"", "article_summary": "Unions want to represent all workers regardless of membership status because it affords them greater rights under federal law.\nApparently one Michigan union, Operating Engineers Local 324, is publishing a quarterly \u201cFreeloaders List\u201d of the names of those who opt out of union membership and their place of work, NRO reports.\nThe unions argue it\u2019s not fair that they are forced to represent workers who don\u2019t pay dues.\nIf a union chose to represent only those workers who pay dues, they would lose these and other powers.\nThat puts non-union workers at increased risk of intimidation and violence\u2014something that\u2019s certainly not unprecedented in Michigan."}
