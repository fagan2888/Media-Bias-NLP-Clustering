GREELEY — There's no denying the talent within the Front Range League where track and field is concerned.

It's proven over time. Year after year the FRL produces some of the best track athletes in the state. In years past much of that talent would call Loveland High School home, with state championships pedigree to prove the point.

However, this year's Indians are often forgotten because they aren't the state title contenders of the past. When it came to the conference championships at District 6 Stadium in Greeley on Friday and Saturday, Loveland's boy's team didn't have many expectations from the outside world.

But Loveland brings something to the track and field that's hard to account for.

"We will always compete to win. The nice thing about technology is you can score pretty much everything and find out where you're supposed to be, and ours boys were supposed to be in the sixth, seventh, eighth range," LHS coach Paul Quere said. "We score more than 80 points and put ourselves in the hunt for the top three. I'm just proud of how our kids competed. They came here to win. There's no way they were supposed to be where they are."

Eager not to be forgotten, the Loveland boys scored far higher than anticipated and earned themselves a fourth-place finish at the Front Range League Championships.

A driving force the past two days for the Indians and their overachievement was coach Quere's son, Marcus Quere. Marcus is peaking at the perfect time of the season, which included breaking a 19-year-old school record Friday in the 3,200 meter.

By the end of the two-day meet, Marcus moved himself up into the top five of the state in 5A in the 800, 1,600 and 3,200, with a conference championship in the 800.

"Honestly, I have to give it up to the offseason. My coaches, Brock Laue and my dad, we put in a lot of work this offseason and I think I've come from being a good runner to getting up there in the state, which is an awesome feeling," the junior said. "A lot of it is mental and remaining positive about everything around you."

Marcus was flirting with another school record in the 800, but missed out on breaking it by a couple seconds, while setting a new personal record at 1:56.28 for a comfortable victory.

It was in those closing meters where he took charge from the third position and separated himself from the competition to win by more than a second.

"Right at the 250 (meter mark) I got a good boost of energy and said 'I might as well put it all on the line, I've got a good chance at winning this,'" he said. "In the last hundred I just knew if I sprinted as fast as I could, because I've got more speed than a lot of the distance runners, I knew I could get a W. Once I got across the line, it was awesome."

Loveland wouldn't sneak by some teams on the power of one or two individuals, but required a team effort and some unexpected contributors to score some points. That's exactly what it got.

Zach Jones (second, 42-02), Garet Davis (seventh, 39-11.75) and Britten Ream (eighth, 39-10.75) all moved into the points in the triple jump finals by setting personal bests, with other guys like David Schlecht (sixth in 200) and Nick Bossenbrook (relay runner), who are all new to track, pushing the team to better heights.

"It's a lot of the guys that nobody knows those names in track, but those are the guys that make us better just because of the way they compete," coach Quere said. "There are a lot of unsung heroes on our team that made us better."

Senior Trevin Long took second in the 100-meter dash with a personal best 11.18 and junior Owen Raisch was fifth in the 200 with a 22.66. The boys 400 relay took second in 43.66 and 1,600 relay placed second in 3:25.18.

Loveland is still developing depth on the girls' side, finishing in sixth place. The Indians received great races from sophomore Blair Bernhardt on Friday, but she was limited due to not feeling well on Saturday.

The 400-meter relay team of Rae McCloughan, Hannah Weinmaster, Sara Jones and Bernhardt showed strong, placing third with a 49.90 and fourth in the 800 spring medley (1:53.59). Weinmaster also placed fourth in the 300 hurdles on a 48.05.

"I thought (the 400 relay) felt good. We all had pretty good exchanges and ran pretty well. I think it went better than we thought with Blair being sick," Weinmaster said. "I was tired, it was a hard day for me, but (the 300 hurdles) felt good. I feel very blessed to be able to run that."

Junior Josie Eder finished fourth in the high jump with a 4-9.50 and third in the pole vault (10-1.00), and sophomore Camryn Kelley sixth (4-6.50). Junior Alex Koschel placed third in the triple jump with a 34-7.75.
