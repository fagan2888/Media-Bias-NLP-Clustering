It updated its previous report that the squadron was a K-9 unit, saying the initial communications may have listed an incorrect squadron.\n\n\"This morning we received one of those calls you never want to receive,\" LaBrutta said.\n\n\"Our hearts and prayers go out to the families that are going to be affected by this tragedy,\" he said, adding that no other victims were found. He declined to surmise on what might have been the motive or give details on why they thought it was an apparent murder-suicide.\n\nLaBrutta said that after an initial report of a shooter, security officers rushed to the scene within three minutes. Both victims were found in an office.\n\nThe incident took place at the Medina annex at the facility, where dog training takes place.\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation was called to assist and has taken the lead in the case, the sheriff's office said.\n\n(Additional reporting by Jon Herskovitz in Austin and reporting by Lisa Maria Garza in Dallas; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Jeffrey Benkoe)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "SAN ANTONIO (Reuters) - Two people were killed in an apparent murder-suicide at Lackla", "title": "Two killed in apparent murder-suicide at Texas air base", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/08/Victims-shooter-Lackland-Air-Force-Base-San-Antonio-sheriff", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/texas-shooter_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/08/Victims-shooter-Lackland-Air-Force-Base-San-Antonio-sheriff", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/texas-shooter_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "SAN ANTONIO (Reuters) - Two people were killed in an apparent murder-suicide at Lackla", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "SAN ANTONIO (Reuters) - Two people were killed in an apparent murder-suicide at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio on Friday that triggered a 90-minute lockdown at the facility, military officials and the Bexar County Sheriff's Office said.\nThe Air Force Times, an independent news outlet, citing internal Pentagon communications, reported that the commanding officer of a training squadron at the base was shot by an airman.\nHe declined to surmise on what might have been the motive or give details on why they thought it was an apparent murder-suicide.\nIt updated its previous report that the squadron was a K-9 unit, saying the initial communications may have listed an incorrect squadron.\n(Additional reporting by Jon Herskovitz in Austin and reporting by Lisa Maria Garza in Dallas; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Jeffrey Benkoe)"}
