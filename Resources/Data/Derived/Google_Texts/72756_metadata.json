That info may be statistical or scientific.\n\nIn the absence of solid facts, the next most effective method often seems to be to instill fear. If you don\u2019t support \u201cagenda X\u201d there will be dire consequences.\n\nIn the case of global warming, the facts don\u2019t support the agenda.\n\nTemperatures have not increased in 18 years. The 1930s actually have the hottest years on record. Why then do we keep reading headlines that global warming is here and Henny Penny the sky is falling?\n\nPerhaps it is because those pushing this agenda keep changing the so-called facts. Oh, they are masters at using fear. They claim more hurricanes and tornadoes are the result of global warming, even though a hurricane hasn\u2019t made landfall in my home state of Florida in 10 years and last year\u2019s U.S. tornado count was the lowest in a generation. They claim the polar ice caps are melting, even though Antarctic Ice set a new record high \u2014 again.\n\nIn short, the facts don\u2019t support the theory. As a savvy public catches on, what are those who make their living from global warming to do?\n\nChange the science. That\u2019s right, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is turning science into science fiction \u2014 literally.\n\nThe federal agency \u201cadjusted\u201d the hiatus in warming out of the temperature record.\n\nNew climate data by NOAA \u201cscientists and researchers doubles the warming trend since the late 1990s by adjusting pre-hiatus temperatures downward and inflating temperatures in more recent years.\n\nYou read me right. These \u201cscientists and researchers\u201d have determined they know better than the actual weather records what the temperatures around the globe were and are. It\u2019s not fact. It\u2019s not science. It\u2019s their best guess, which by no small coincidence, supports the theory of global warming.\n\nLet\u2019s call it what it is.
