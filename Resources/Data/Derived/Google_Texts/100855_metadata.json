Lerner emails released this month revealed a potentially huge loophole in federal open-records practices when an IRS tech staffer acknowledged that the agency doesn\u2019t regularly store \u2014 and never checks \u2014 instant message chats as official government records.\n\nAnalysts say there is no question that the Internal Revenue Service and all other federal agencies should be storing chats and even cellphone text messages that may constitute official government documents, but a check by The Washington Times suggests that hardly any agency is doing so.\n\nOf 17 agencies surveyed by The Times, just two said they had policies requiring instant messages to be stored as official, searchable records.\n\nPHOTOS: Eye-popping excuses in American political scandals\n\nOne agency said it doesn\u2019t allow use of text or chat, six agencies said they didn\u2019t have specific policies or were working on language to cover modern technology, and another eight agencies did not provide any answers about their policies despite multiple requests.\n\n\u201cWe are disappointed, though not surprised, to hear that federal agencies don\u2019t have policies in place to protect this type of information from being destroyed,\u201d said Emily Grannis, a legal fellow at the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press.\n\n\u201cTexts, instant messages, voice mails and other quick, informal types of communications have long been considered public records under state and federal freedom of information laws, and have become so ubiquitous that often those are the only records we have of how decisions are made,\u201d Ms. Grannis said. \u201cThe government should take extra care to ensure those records are preserved instead of casually allowing them to disappear.\u201d\n\nSEE ALSO: Technology problems at IRS go far beyond loss of Lois Lerner\u2019s email\n\nOpen-records laws require federal departments and agencies to store key documents that show official decision-making. The practice preserves the records for contemporaneous and future research on how the government works. The laws were drawn up when all records were put on paper, but have been updated to include electronic communications.\n\nAgencies appear to have adopted rules for handling email, but even that technology is being supplanted. Government officials are scrambling to keep up.\n\nThe National Archives and Records Administration, which is responsible for preserving federal records, recommends that documents that aren\u2019t stored automatically, such as text messages, be forwarded, pasted into emails or otherwise memorialized.\n\nThe same rules apply to phone conversations and voice mail messages, though it\u2019s unclear how many government employees are taking and storing notes of those communications, either.\n\nThe issue of whether instant messages and texts from mobile devices are being stored has been percolating for years among those charged with thinking about government transparency and open-records requests.\n\nLast week, however, a release of emails showed that Ms. Lerner asked whether instant-message chats were stored. The former IRS employee at the center of the tea party targeting scandal raised the question in the middle of what appeared to be a discussion about how to hide information from Congress.\n\nA tech staffer replied that each person could change settings to determine whether conversations on the IRS chat system, the Office Communications Server, were stored automatically, though the default was not to store chats. He also said the document search tool didn\u2019t include chats that were stored, so those messages wouldn\u2019t come up in open-records requests.\n\n\u201cI was cautioning folks about email and how we have had several occasions where Congress has asked for emails and there has been an electronic search for responsive emails \u2014 so we need to be cautious about what we say in emails,\u201d Ms. Lerner wrote. \u201cSomeone asked if OCS conversations were also searchable \u2014 I don\u2019t know, but told them I would get back to them. Do you know?\u201d\n\nThe staffer replied: \u201cOCS messages are not set to automatically save as the standard; however the functionality exists within the software. That being said the parties involved in an OCS conversation can copy and save the contents of the conversations to an email or file.\u201d\n\nShe went on to say: \u201cTo date OCS conversations are not specifically identified as part of the Electronic Data Request (EDR) for information, however, if one of the parties save the conversation as an email or file they would become part of the electronic search.\u201d\n\nThe IRS didn\u2019t respond to repeated requests for comment on its handling of those electronic records.\n\nThe issue also has popped up in relation to the Environmental Protection Agency, where a conservative researcher is trying to obtain computer chat and cellphone text messages from EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy, arguing that they constitute official records.\n\nChristopher Horner, the researcher battling the EPA, said some employees are using instant message chats instead of email as a way to avoid scrutiny.\n\n\u201cThe failure to search for text or other instant messages, in systems provided by the taxpayer specifically for work-related correspondence, is endemic to appointees and career bureaucrats alike,\u201d Mr. Horner said.\n\nHe said the open-records process has a fundamental flaw: It relies on government employees to police themselves, and requests for documents usually involve those who have the most to hide.\n\n\u201cFOIA, as well as congressional oversight requests, operate on an honor system. Which requires people of honor. So you see the trouble this begs,\u201d he said.\n\nOf the 16 agencies surveyed by The Times, only two appeared to be mostly in compliance. The Health and Human Services Department said its computer systems don\u2019t have instant chat functions, but its policy indicates that instant messages and text messages should be treated the same as email.\n\nLikewise, the CIA said it stores instant messages and follows applicable laws when responding to records requests from the public or Congress.\n\nMore common were agencies that said they try to comply with federal law. Treasury Department officials, for example, said they \u201ctake seriously\u201d their duty to the law, though they didn\u2019t explain specifically what their policy was.\n\nThe National Security Agency would not disclose whether text messages or computer chats were stored but said any records that were kept are searched as part of open-records requests.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Lois G.
