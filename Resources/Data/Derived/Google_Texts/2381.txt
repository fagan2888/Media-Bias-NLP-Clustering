Re: “Colorado ‘right to rest’ homeless bill gets testimony in House committee,” April 16 news story.



The Right to Rest Act is designed to allow people experiencing homelessness in Colorado to exist in public space.

I am a formerly homeless veteran. I slept outside the entire summer of 2012. On no less than six occasions I was approached by Denver police. At no time was I offered any information about a shelter or any other type of service. I was simply told to move along, no matter what time it was.

I grew tired of employers not hiring me because I used 2323 Curtis St. (the St. Francis homeless center) as a mailing address. I also grew tired of the way RTD treats anyone they think is homeless. I was told to leave Civic Center Station even though I had bus fare, and I was refused service on more than one occasion because I appeared to be homeless.

If we aren’t allowed to sit in public areas, then where are we able to sit?

Criminalizing acts of people experiencing homelessness does nothing good for the homeless individual or the business community.
