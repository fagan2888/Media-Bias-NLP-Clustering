Fairview Place, a Denver landmark since 1984 \u2014 four years before he purchased it.\n\nAccording to the city Landmark Preservation Commission, Painter pulled a reroofing permit in January 2009 but then began to modify the second-floor roofline of the brick home to add more habitable space without permits or preservation board review.\n\nA stop-work order was issued.\n\nPainter was notified by regular mail and by certified mail that he was expected to appear at the Dec. 5 hearing to argue why civil penalties and other enforcement action should not be taken against him, Burns said.\n\nIf the penalties continue to mount and exceed 110 percent of the assessed value of the home \u2014 about $495,000, according to city tax records \u2014 the house could be seized by the city.\n\n\u201cIt is the city\u2019s hope that Mr. Painter sells the property,\u201d Burns said.\n\nPainter applied for a demolition permit in 2010 and said he would prefer to tear down the house and replace it with condominiums overlooking Highland Park.\n\nPainter said he never received notification of the Dec. 5 hearing. He said he has hired an attorney and hopes to vacate the fines.\n\n\u201cI own that property outright. And if the city pulls this off, they\u2019re going to literally steal $500,000 from me,\u201d Painter said. \u201cHere I end up with nothing if they get their way.\u201d\n\nAustin Briggs: 303-954-1729, abriggs@denverpost.com", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Owner of Historic Bosler house fined $218,000", "title": "Owner of Historic Bosler house fined $218,000", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/12/14/owner-of-historic-bosler-house-fined-218000/", "image": {"width": 483, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131214__20131215_B10_CD15BOSLERFINE1p1.jpg", "height": 654}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131214__20131215_B10_CD15BOSLERFINE1p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-14T15:04:35+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-29T10:12:22+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1c09\"", "article_summary": "Painter owns the Bosler House, 3209 W.
