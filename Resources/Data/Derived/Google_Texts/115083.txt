KAPOLEI, Hawaii (AP) — Sei Young Kim holed out from 154 yards for eagle to win the LPGA Tour’s Lotte Championship on the first hole of a playoff Saturday with Inbee Park.

After driving into the water in regulation on the par-4 18th, Kim forced the playoff with an 18-foot chip-in for par. She then won on the hole with her 8-iron shot that barely cleared the water.

The 22-year-old South Korean player became the first two-time winner on the LPGA Tour this year. She won in the Bahamas in February in her second start as a tour member.
