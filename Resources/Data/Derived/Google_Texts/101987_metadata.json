That hasn\u2019t protected him from the buffoonery that infects every level of this franchise.\n\nSEE ALSO: Tony Romo flips the script to stun Redskins\n\nIn anything approaching a normal season \u2014 you know, one not riddled with leaks and decimated expectations and relentless off-field drama \u2014 Garcon\u2019s emergence as the go-to receiver would be a story worth repeating. The man handed $42.5 million as a free agent in 2012 is delivering a season worthy of the five-year contract.\n\nNone of the catches, however, have been enough to slow, even for a moment, the free-fall to a month of meaningless games and an early offseason for the NFL\u2019s headquarters of dysfunction.\n\nGarcon hasn\u2019t hidden his ample frustration this season, from detailing how the team\u2019s passing game \u201csucks\u201d to kicking a football into the stands after an incomplete pass to draw the unwelcome attention of a referee.\n\nCan you blame him?\n\nAs rain showers rolled through Sunday, Garcon did as he pleased for three quarters against a Cowboys secondary that resembled a worse version of their troubled Redskins counterparts. The Cowboys aided the 11 catches for 144 yards and one touchdown by inexplicably leaving him wide-open on play after play. The hideous condition of the turf, yet again, didn\u2019t matter.\n\nIf you can\u2019t beat Garcon then, um, don\u2019t cover him?\n\nIn the third quarter, Garcon pulled in a 10-yard pass from Kirk Cousins. The receiver hurled the ball to the sideline. That gave Garcon 107 catches this year to break Art Monk\u2019s single-season franchise record that stood for 29 years. Finally, something to discuss that didn\u2019t revolve around Mike Shanahan\u2019s corroded job security or the coach\u2019s relationship with benched quarterback Robert Griffin III.\n\nTo break Monk\u2019s record, Garcon overcame Griffin\u2019s chronic inaccuracy that regularly forced the receiver to contort his body into all manner of unnatural positions to simply have an opportunity to catch the football. Overcame the lack of a consistent No. 2 (or No. 3, for that matter) receiver to draw attention of opposing defenses. The wild swings in play-calling. The elevation of Cousins to starter earlier this month.\n\nMonk, you may remember, had Joe Theismann under center all season in 1984. No back-and-forth at the position. Pro Football Hall of Famer John Riggins plowed ahead at running back. And, distant as the memory may be, an actual cohesive organization stood behind the entire on-field operation.\n\nWhat Garcon did Sunday wasn\u2019t unusual by the standards of his season. Garcon kept catching footballs (aside from the one he displaced with a half-kick, half-stomp that didn\u2019t result in a penalty).\n\n\u201cEven when we were in the dumps,\u201d fellow receiver Santana Moss said, speaking as if the unfortunate destination was already behind the team, \u201cwe could rely on No. 88.\u201d\n\nGarcon\u2019s words, however, barely rose about mumbles after the game.\n\n\u201cWith the season going on like this,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s pretty hard to celebrate anything right now.\u201d\n\nIf anything, Garcon\u2019s efforts served to highlight, once again, the woeful roster around him.\n\nThe record, remarkable as such a feat is in a season so bad, couldn\u2019t eliminate another special-teams letdown that allowed the Cowboys to return a punt 62 yards by a player signed Wednesday as a free-agent.\n\nThe record couldn\u2019t stop the familiar penalties in critical situations, like the third-and-goal at the 3-yard line that ended in a field goal after the Redskins were called for a false start and an illegal shift before having to burn a timeout.\n\nThe record couldn\u2019t help with the defense\u2019s missed tackles and bad angles and, perhaps worst of all, Tony Romo\u2019s 51-yard pass to wide-open Terrance Williams to help set up the winning touchdown.\n\nSo, Garcon broke the decades-old record. His picture flashed on the stadium\u2019s big-screen televisions after the catch. The crowd made noise that didn\u2019t involve boos or grumbles en route to the exits.\n\nThen reality returned.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The last-ditch pass had fallen incomplete, bIn the third quarter, Garcon pulled in a 10-yard pass from Kirk Cousins.
