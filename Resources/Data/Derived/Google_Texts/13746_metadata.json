Vincent Vernuccio, labor policy director at the free-market Mackinac Center for Public Policy, spelled out the problem and his proposed \u201cWorker\u2019s Choice\u201d fix in a report published Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re suggesting a very simple, very commonsense approach that if workers don\u2019t want representation, and don\u2019t want to pay for representation, they should be able to represent themselves,\u201d Vernuccio told Watchdog.org.\n\n\u201cIt gives workers the freedom to say, \u2018No thanks,\u2019 and it gives unions the freedom to say, \u2018Goodbye,\u2019 and it works out for everybody,\u201d Vernuccio continued.\n\nUnder existing laws in most states, some or all public-sector workers can unionize. When they do, the union becomes their \u201cexclusive representative\u201d in negotiations with employers.\n\nExclusive representation gives unions monopoly bargaining power over workers\u2019 pay and other aspects of their jobs, restricting the freedom of workers and of unions, too.\n\nBACKGROUND: How powerful are public employee unions in your state?\n\nUnions support exclusive representation, but complain about its effects in states where right-to-work laws let workers avoid forced dues.\n\nEven in right-to-work states, workers can be stuck with representation they don\u2019t want \u2014 and unions stuck representing nonmembers, referred to as \u201cfree riders\u201d by union bosses.\n\nThe Worker\u2019s Choice model legislation Vernuccio recommends would fix this for public-sector workers and their unions, without making any other changes to union laws.\n\n\u201cWe went to great lengths to make sure there were no unintended consequences of this idea,\u201d Vernuccio said. \u201cMainly, we made sure that it\u2019s a small, logical change and it doesn\u2019t change collective bargaining in any other way.\u201d\n\nWith right-to-work laws on the books in 25 states \u2014 including traditional union strongholds Michigan and Wisconsin \u2014 Vernuccio and Mackinac believe it\u2019s past time to address the issue of forced representation.\n\nVernuccio thinks state legislatures could accomplish this using his Worker\u2019s Choice plan to reform public-sector union laws, most of which are based on the National Labor Relations Act of 1935.\n\nJohn Adams, an Ohio Senate candidate and former member of Ohio House leadership who pushed for right-to-work in the state before reaching his term limit, sees Worker\u2019s Choice as a logical extension of right-to-work.\n\n\u201cI would support any legislation advancing the American dream of having a job without being forced to have a union between you and your employer,\u201d Adams told Watchdog.org.\n\nAdams suggested lawmakers could easily implement Worker\u2019s Choice in right-to-work states, since those states already protect workers from forced union dues.\n\n\u201cWorker\u2019s Choice would take away the union \u2018free rider\u2019 complaint,\u201d he added, which could lead more states to adopt right-to-work laws.\n\nBut not his home state, at least for the foreseeable future. \u201cIn Ohio it\u2019s not about being able to win the argument, because there\u2019s no political will to even make the argument,\u201d Adams said.\n\nIn states with right-to-work laws, Vernuccio sees Worker\u2019s Choice as the missing piece that would free public-sector unions to behave like other businesses.\n\n\u201cRight-to-work makes unions stronger,\u201d Vernuccio said, \u201cBecause unions can\u2019t take their membership for granted in a right-to-work state.\u201d\n\nWith Worker\u2019s Choice, \u201cthose unions can go back to those workers and say, \u2018If you want representation, you have to pay up,'\u201d he explained.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the way the free market works,\u201d Vernuccio concluded. \u201cEssentially it\u2019s a binary choice: either you\u2019re in the union and paying the union, or you\u2019re out of the union and representing yourself.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Union reformers have designed an escape hatch for millions of teachers and government workers forced to accept union representation.", "og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Union reformers have designed an escape hatch for millions of teachers and government workers forced to accept union representation.", "title": "Reform could free workers from forced union representation -
