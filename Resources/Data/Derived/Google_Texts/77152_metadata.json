Chris Christie says Republican victories in governor's races across the country show voters want leaders who will \"get things done,\" rather that fighting over ideology. Christie, chairman of the Republican Governors Association and a possible 2016 candidate for president, said he was gratified by GOP wins in Democratic-leaning states such as Maryland, Massachusetts and Illinois, as well as victories in key swing states like Florida, Michigan, Wisconsin and Ohio. Christie said voters \"elect and re-elect governors to get things done.\" Christie, who campaigned for GOP candidates across the country, said the winners deserve the credit, not him. He said elections are \"always about the candidate.\" Christie spoke Wednesday on NBC's \"Today\" show, ABC's \"Good Morning America\" and Fox News Channel.\n\n11/05/2014 7:46 AM EST President Obama To Address Midterm Results In Afternoon Press Conference President Barack Obama will speak to the press Wednesday afternoon to address his party's resounding loss in the 2014 midterm elections, according to White House press secretary Josh Earnest. He is expected to strike a tone of compromise and accountability following a Republican takeover of the U.S. Senate and many of the nation's gubernatorial offices. Obama tried reached out to Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who is widely expected to be the next senate majority leader and who also won re-election Tuesday night, and left a message, CNN reported. The president's press conference will take place at 2:50 p.m. Eastern time from the East Room of the White House.

Michael Grimm, a Republican facing a 20-count indictment won in New York and another known for outbursts of rage and killing a beagle, Mike Bost, won a seat in President Barack Obama's home state of Illinois that had been Democratic for 70 years. Down in Tennessee, Rep. Scott DesJarlais' past infidelities and pushing of abortion on a mistress continued to not matter to voters, who handed him a landslide victory. There were a couple of bright spots for Democrats, or at least the more moderate crowd. Florida Rep. Steve Southerland lost to Democrat Gwen Graham after holding an all-male fundraiser and joking about Graham in lingerie. And in Louisiana, GOP Rep. Vance McAllister, dubbed the \"Kissing Congressman\" after he was caught on tape smooching a staffer, finished far back in the field in his contest. -- Michael McAuliff\n\n11/05/2014 5:24 AM EST Expect A Delay In Results AP not calling these races until the number of outstanding votes can be verified: Va. gov.; Conn. gov.; Colo. gov.; Alaska gov, Senate. \u2014 AP Politics (@AP_Politics) November 5, 2014\n\n11/05/2014 5:07 AM EST Alaska Becomes 4th State To Legalize Recreational Marijuana In yet another major pushback against the war on drugs, Alaska legalized recreational marijuana on Tuesday, joining Oregon and Washington, D.C. -- both of which legalized cannabis only hours before. Alaska becomes the fourth state in the U.S. to legalize retail marijuana, along with Oregon, Colorado and Washington state. Voters approved Measure 2, which legalizes the possession, use and sale of recreational marijuana. Adults, age 21 and older, may possess up to 1 ounce of marijuana and grow up to six plants (with no more than three being mature) for personal use. The measure also legalizes the manufacture, sale and possession of marijuana paraphernalia, such as devices used for smoking or storing the plant. \u201cThe folks trying to keep marijuana illegal are relying on the same scare tactics today that they have relied on for decades, but voters just aren\u2019t falling for it anymore,\" Rob Kampia, executive director of the Marijuana Policy Project, said in a statement early Wednesday morning. \"The results are particularly encouraging since voter turnout during a midterm election is typically smaller, older, and more conservative. Clearly, support for ending marijuana prohibition spans the political and ideological spectrums.\" Read more here. -- Matt Ferner\n\n11/05/2014 4:28 AM EST Ah, Politics...

Tonight is a big victory for We the People! Credit is due to the victorious candidates. Your message to President Obama is undeniably received, though he'll try to ignore it. ... The Democrats got mauled today, deservedly so. To prohibit that from happening to the GOP in 2016, it must learn the lesson from the last time Republicans held the Senate majority. This time they must not retreat, and it's our responsibility to hold them accountable. Will they fight for reform that aligns with the limited government planks of the Republican platform, or will they return to the big government cronyism and status quo favored by the permanent political class? Will they drain the swamp or decide the D.C. cesspool is really just a jacuzzi they can't wait to jump on into and shake us off? If GOP leadership returns to business as usual, then this majority will be short lived, for We the People say, \u201conce bitten, twice shy.\u201d Click here to read the full statement.\n\n11/05/2014 2:55 AM EST Alaska Approves Minimum Wage Increase ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) _ Alaskans have voted to raise the minimum wage. \u2014 Becky Bohrer (@beckybohrerap) November 5, 2014\n\n11/05/2014 2:39 AM EST Alaska Rep.
