It\u2019s a joke to have a gun. It\u2019s a joke to pull a trigger.\u201d\n\nMr. Bloomberg brought up the New York Police Department\u2019s stop-and-frisk practices, recalling a time during his last year in office when a Baptist minster in Harlem invited him to speak at their church, The Times reported.\n\n\u201cWhile I\u2019m sitting there waiting for him to introduce me, he said to his congregation, \u2018You know, if every one of you stopped and frisked your kid before they went out at night, the mayor wouldn\u2019t have to do it,\u2019\u201d Mr. Bloomberg said. \u201cAnd so I knew I was going to be OK with that audience.\u201d\n\nThe former mayor spoke to a sold-out crowd Friday about a variety of topics, including poverty, education and marijuana legalization.\n\nMr. Bloomberg argued that Colorado\u2019s legalization of recreational marijuana use was a terrible idea and is hurting children, The Times reported.\n\n\u201cWhat are we going to say in 10 years when we see all these kids whose IQs are 5 and 10 points lower than they would have been?\u201d he asked. \u201cI couldn\u2019t feel more strongly about it, and my girlfriend says it\u2019s no different than alcohol. It is different than alcohol. This is one of the stupider things that\u2019s happening across our country.\u201d\n\nThe New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, the state\u2019s largest gun rights group, compared Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s comments to those uttered by white supremacists and demanded the former mayor apologize.\n\n\u201cMayor Bloomberg\u2019s statement that black males should not be allowed to have guns echos similar sentiments made by southern white supremacists in the 19th century,\u201d Tom King, the association\u2019s president, said in a statement. \u201cSo called \u2018Black Codes\u2019 were enacted by various southern states to discriminate against black Americans and maintain the system of white supremacy that made slavery possible. These included restrictions on firearms possession.\n\n\u201cIf a politician said this about anything other than guns, the mainstream media would be all over them,\u201d Mr. King argued. \u201cMichael Bloomberg isn\u2019t just any politician, he is the leading voice for gun control in America. He should be held accountable for this slander.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg reportedly argued Friday that guns need to be kept out of the hands of minorities in order to keep them alive.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg reportedly argued Friday that guns need to be kept out of the hands of minorities in order to keep them alive.", "title": "Michael Bloomberg suggests disarming minorities to \u2018keep them alive\u2019: report", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/feb/8/sughed-michael-bloomberg-suggests-disarming-minori/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/06/d07bf19df56e55056d0f6a7067007d2a.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/06/d07bf19df56e55056d0f6a7067007d2a.jpg", "description": "Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg reportedly argued Friday that guns need to be kept out of the hands of minorities in order to keep them alive.", "card": "summary", "title": "Michael Bloomberg suggests disarming minorities to \u2018keep them al"}, "Author": "Jessica Chasmar", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Bloomberg"}, "article_summary": "Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg reportedly argued Friday that guns need to be kept out of the hands of minorities in order to keep them alive.\nMr. Bloomberg argued that Colorado\u2019s legalization of recreational marijuana use was a terrible idea and is hurting children, The Times reported.\n\u201cMichael Bloomberg isn\u2019t just any politician, he is the leading voice for gun control in America.\n\u201cThese kids think they\u2019re going to get killed anyway because all their friends are getting killed,\u201d said Mr. Bloomberg, who funds the gun-control advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety.\nCities need to get guns out of this group\u2019s hands and keep them alive, the former three-term mayor said, according to The Times."}
