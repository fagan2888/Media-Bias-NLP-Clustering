And so far, the 17th District contest between Democratic U.S. Rep. Matt Cartwright and Republican David Moylan has been fairly quiet.\n\nBut after reporting nearly empty campaign coffers following his three-way primary, Moylan\u2019s campaign announced Thursday that they\u2019re airing a 30-second TV spot on cable channels in Schuylkill, Carbon, Monroe, and Northampton counties. (The district includes Easton and part of northeastern Northampton County.)\n\nThe ad highlights Moylan\u2019s resume as a radiation oncologist, describing the country as \u201cgravely ill.\u201d It notes his opposition to Obamacare and amnesty for those who entered the country illegally.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s get America healthy again,\u201d the ad\u2019s narrator says. \u201cVote Dr. David Moylan \u2013 the cure for Congress.\u201d\n\nMoylan\u2019s campaign manager, Hank Clarke, did not respond to questions about the size of the ad buy, but said it will be airing on an assortment of channels -- including Fox News, CNN, The History Channel, Discovery Channel, and BRCTV-13 -- \u201cfrom now until Election Day.\u201d\n\nMoylan's latest finance report, which was due Wednesday, isn\u2019t available yet on the Federal Election Commission website. But it will need to show some strong summer fundraising to pay for the TV spot \u2013 Moylan\u2019s June filing reported him having less than $100 on hand.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Moylan airs TV ad in 17th District race", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The Morning Call", "author": "The Morning Call", "og": {"site_name": "themorningcall.com", "description": "It\u2019s been a sleepy fall for Lehigh Valley congressional races.", "title": "Moylan airs TV ad in 17th District race", "url": "http://www.mcall.com/news/nationworld/pennsylvania/capitol-ideas/mc-moylan-airs-tv-ad-in-17th-district-race-20141016-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-54403045/turbine/mc-moylan-airs-tv-ad-in-17th-district-race-20141016", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp06.14", "twitter": {"site": "@mcall", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "David Moylan Matt Cartwright 17th District Congress", "fb": {"admins": 1762506491, "page_id": 73291032902, "app_id": 377275452340817}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=501096172, app-argument=http://www.mcall.com/deeplinkid/81699120", "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2014-10-16", "Description": "David Moylan airs TV ad in 17th District race against Democratic U.S. Rep.
