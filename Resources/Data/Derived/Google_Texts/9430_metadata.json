Cognizant, which operates on lower margins than its rivals, has been able to win a larger share of the business.\n\n\"We continue to also see healthy demand in the sort of traditional outsourcing types of businesses on the continent,\" Chief Executive Francisco D'Souza said on the conference call.\n\nCognizant's third-quarter sales rose 22 percent to $2.31 billion.\n\nThe company's net income rose to $319.6 million, or $1.05 per share in the third quarter, from $276.9 million, or 91 cents per share, a year earlier.\n\nAnalysts on average had expected earnings of $1.01 per share on revenue of $2.26 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\n\nThe company said it expects earnings of at least $4.01 per share on revenue growth of at least 20.3 percent to $8.84 billion.\n\nIt had previously forecast earnings of at least $3.96 per share on revenue growth of at least 19 percent to $8.74 billion.\n\nAnalysts on average were expecting earnings of $3.98 per share on revenue of $8.76 billion.\n\nShares of Teaneck, New Jersey-based Cognizant, which has most of its employees in India, were up 3 percent at $89.41 on the Nasdaq on Tuesday.\n\n(Reporting by Sruthi Ramakrishnan in Bangalore;
