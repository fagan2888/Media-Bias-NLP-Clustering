The Alaska Legislature will sue Gov. Bill Walker to block his attempt to unilaterally expand Medicaid benefits in Alaska.

On Tuesday, following a closed-door executive session in Anchorage, the Legislative Council voted 10-1 to spend $450,000 for legal services needed to launch the lawsuit.

The council is a joint House-Senate body that takes action for the Legislature while out of session. The council’s current membership has a large majority of Republicans. Rep. Sam Kito, D-Juneau, cast the sole “no” vote against funding the lawsuit.

In a press conference following the end of Tuesday’s Council meeting, Senate Majority Leader John Coghill, R-North Pole, said “the course of action is to try to get before a court to ask for a stay on the governor’s authority to expand Medicaid unilaterally.”

Walker’s decision to expand the federal program was expected to take effect Sept. 1, and the Legislature needed to act before that deadline in order to stop the move.

In a press conference Tuesday afternoon, Walker came across as coolly determined. Speaking more quickly than normal, he explained that he remains determined.

“It is totally unacceptable,” he said. “I am not wavering for a minute.”

He further added that he doesn’t understand the need for the lawsuit.

“I cannot understand, I cannot fathom ... why taking away the health care coverage of working Alaskans is a rational issue,” he said.

In the Republican press conference after the end of Tuesday’s Legislative Council meeting, lawmakers said they felt they needed to halt the governor’s action because it violated the Legislature’s authority. “It’s about the process. It’s about the legislative process,” said Rep. Mike Chenault, R-Nikiski and Speaker of the House.

Walker responded to that assertion by saying that the Legislature has had ample opportunities to address Medicaid expansion since 2012, when it became a possibility under the Affordable Care Act. He pointed out that the Legislature failed to hold a single hearing on Medicaid expansion during a special session earlier this year called specifically to address expansion among other issues.

“All I’m asking for is a vote,” he said.

The lawsuit will stand on whether Medicaid expansion is “optional” or not. Walker’s action would extend Medicaid coverage to Alaskans whose incomes are up to 138 percent of the federal poverty line. Best estimates indicate that would bring health care coverage up to an additional 40,000 Alaskans.

Under state law, Legislative approval is required before expanding Medicaid coverage to additional optional groups. The governor has contended that a portion of the Social Security Act’s Medicaid title defines expansion categories as mandatory, not optional.

“We feel that we must first pass the law,” Senate President Kevin Meyer, R-Anchorage, said. “It’s not even really about Medicaid expansion — it’s about process.”

The Alaska Senate’s Democrats wasted no time responding to that assertion. In a statement emailed three minutes after the Republican press conference ended, Senate Minority Leader Berta Gardner, D-Anchorage, said in part that “elected officials wasting time and money on lawsuits to fight against the wishes and needs of Alaskans makes no sense to me, and I’m confident Alaskans will see it for the political grandstanding it is.”

Rep. Kito, speaking by phone Tuesday afternoon from Anchorage, said the vote seemed to come rapidly, after less than an hour of deliberation, and that he only heard about the Legislative Council meeting late last week.

“The notice was very short, the deliberation was quite short ... it was really not, in my opinion, a very well-deliberated action,” he said. “The 10-1 vote seemed to be something that was decided on prior to the meeting.”

House and Senate Republicans said Tuesday that along with the issue of Legislative authority, they’re concerned about the price of expansion. The federal government is expected to foot 90 percent of the price of expansion, and Walker has said the state is prepared to walk away from expansion if the federal government doesn’t hold up its end of the bargain.

If the state walks away from the program, that would leave Alaskans in jeopardy, Coghill said. “Do we want to start something that we can’t finish?”

Walker said he expects the lawsuit will cost the state $1 million before it is resolved. That figure covers the $450,000 allocated by the Legislature from its own budget and another $450,000 to cover the state’s expenses in defense.

“We’ve been trimming back significantly in our Department of Law, and we’ll probably have to hire outside counsel as well,” Walker said.

The motion approved by the Legislative Council calls for 25 percent of the $450,000 to come from the House operating budget, 25 percent to come from the Senate operating budget and the remaining 50 percent to come from the Legislative Council budget.

Coghill and others in attendance at the meeting Tuesday said they do not have a timeline for the lawsuit but expect Monday is the soonest they can file a temporary restraining order.
