And, having a low patient satisfaction or HCAHPS scores can directly impact the financial operations of a healthcare organization as well as its reputation in the community.\n\nAsk any person who has ever been hospitalized or stayed at the bedside of a loved one, and they will agree that hospitals are busy, noisy places. Alarms clang. Pages blare overhead. Doors open and close. TVs drone. And, of course, people talk. This takes away from the overall healing and patient experience.\n\nDue to the high volume of overhead pages, patients complained that Inspira Health Network (IHN) hospitals were too noisy and even gave the hospitals low patient satisfaction scores. So, IHN launched an initiative with mobile communications app Practice Unite to lower the noise level in its hospitals and it was able to take the overhead pages down from 150 a day to less than three a day and increase its patient sat scores.\n\nOver the last year, Inspira Health Network\u2019s Vineland Hospital has also been able to increase HCAHPS Scores by 26% as part of the Quiet Hospital Initiative compared to the prior twelve months at this one hospital (there are 60 in the INH network) and the solution is being deployed at other locations and initial scores are also trending upwards.\n\n\u201cWe always strive to provide a great patient experience at Inspira,\u201d said Tom Pacek, chief information officer, Inspira Health Network. \u201cIt was clear that we needed to reduce the number of overhead pages in our three main facilities. The problem was that our nurses had become dependent on this system to reach physicians. Practice Unite, Futura Mobility and Pursuit Healthcare worked with our IT team to design an innovative solution that has allowed us to all but eliminate overhead paging. This made an immediate impact that is already showing up as increased HCAHPS scores.\u201d\n\nThe Practice Unite solution makes it easy for nurses to reach physicians. They send a secure text from their desktop to a secure mobile app on the physician\u2019s phone. The physicians call the nurses back directly by clicking on the message which routes automatically to the nurses at their assigned extension. These extensions can change on a daily basis. The Practice Unite app makes it simple for the nurse to change this daily.\n\nFeatured image credit: Flickr via cc", "article_metadata": {"description": "Inspira Health Network\u2019s Vineland Hospital has also been able to increase HCAHPS Scores by 26% as part of the Quiet Hospital Initiative compared to the prior twelve months at this one hospital", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"description": "Inspira Health Network\u2019s Vineland Hospital has also been able to increase HCAHPS Scores by 26% as part of the Quiet Hospital Initiative compared to the prior twelve months at this one hospital", "title": "Quiet Hospital Initiative Helps Increase HCAHPs Scores by 26%", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 480, "identifier": "http://wrm5sysfkg-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Quiet-Hospital.jpg", "height": 640}, "url": "http://hitconsultant.net/2015/11/13/quiet-hospital-initiative-helps-increase-hcahps-scores-by-26/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Inspira Health Network\u2019s Vineland Hospital has also been able to increase HCAHPS Scores by 26% as part of the Quiet Hospital Initiative compared to the prior twelve months at this one hospital", "creator": "@hitconsultant", "image": "http://wrm5sysfkg-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Quiet-Hospital.jpg", "title": "Quiet Hospital Initiative Helps Increase HCAHPs Scores by 26%", "site": "@hitconsultant", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "google-site-verification": "ZfA9TYzJhTo4Qq5hZKk2GVBYHj0-7Bu73PO0P5jbDaI", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/HIT-Consultant-Media/302199219847409", "section": "Health IT", "tag": "Practice Unite", "published_time": "2015-11-13T12:35:13-04:00", "author": "http://pages/hit-consultant-llc/302199219847409"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cIt was clear that we needed to reduce the number of overhead pages in our three main facilities.\nThe Practice Unite app makes it simple for the nurse to change this daily.\nThis made an immediate impact that is already showing up as increased HCAHPS scores.\u201dThe Practice Unite solution makes it easy for nurses to reach physicians.\nDue to the high volume of overhead pages, patients complained that Inspira Health Network (IHN) hospitals were too noisy and even gave the hospitals low patient satisfaction scores.\nAnd, having a low patient satisfaction or HCAHPS scores can directly impact the financial operations of a healthcare organization as well as its reputation in the community."}
