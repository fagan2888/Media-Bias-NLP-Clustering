The jump reflects surging prices for a key ingredient: pork.\n\nThe producer price index for pork is up 16.5% from a year ago. A category that includes beef and veal is 9.3% higher. (The overall price index rose 1.4% in March from a year earlier, the largest annual increase since last August.)\n\nBloomberg News\n\nA. Litteri, an Italian grocery and deli in Washington, just last week raised the price of its Italian sausage \u2014 all made in-house \u2014 by a dollar to $4.99 a pound, said owner Michael DeFrancisci. That was the first price increase in roughly a decade.\n\nThe price of Boston butt, which the store uses to make its hot and mild sausages, has climbed about a dollar a pound in the last three weeks, Mr. DeFrancisci said.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know when it\u2019s going to come back down again,\u201d Mr. DeFrancisci said. \u201cNot in the foreseeable future. We\u2019ll leave [the price of sausage] like it is for quite some time.\u201d\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which uses different metrics, hog prices surged in the second half of February and landed about 13% higher than a year earlier.\n\nUSDA analysts say prices are rising in anticipation of shortages. The porcine epidemic diarrhea virus was first confirmed in the U.S. last May at an Iowa farm. The disease has since spread to 28 states and killed millions of young pigs, rapidly increasing costs for major hog-farm operators and threatening to curb U.S. pork supplies.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of uncertainty in the market,\u201d said USDA agricultural economist Mildred Haley. \u201cNo one has a perfect count on the deaths, on infections. That\u2019s a big part of the problem.\u201d\n\nDemand may also be a factor. While pork prices are rising, beef prices are rising even faster after cattle herds were thinned by drought.\n\n\u201cHigh beef prices are inducing most consumers to alter their animal-product consumption patterns: less beef, more pork (at higher prices), and more poultry (at flat-to-lower prices),\u201d the USDA said in a monthly report.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "It\u2019s a bad time to pig out on a capicola sub or sausage pizza.
