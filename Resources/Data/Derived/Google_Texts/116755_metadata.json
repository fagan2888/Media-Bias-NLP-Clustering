Although the administrative costs of healthcare are projected to remain high throughout 2022, the ACA only promotes billions of dollars in bureaucratic waste, confirms a Health Affairs blog study from David U. Himmelstein, MD, FACP, Professor at the City University of New York School of Public Health at Hunter College and Lecturer of Medicine at Harvard Medical School and Steffie Woolhandler, MD, MPH, FACP, Professor in the CUNY School of Public Health at Hunter College, Adjunct Clinical Professor at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, and Lecturer in Medicine at Harvard Medical School.\n\n\u201cThe roughly $6 billion in exchange start-up costs pale in comparison to the ongoing insurance overhead that the ACA has added to our health care system \u2014 more than a quarter of a trillion dollars through 2022,\u201d the researchers assert. This idea is presented in direct connection with earlier 2014 projections released by the Office of the Actuary from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). According the CMS\u2019s forecast summary, healthcare spending will increase at the rate of 5.8 percent until 2022.\n\n\u201cImproving economic conditions, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) coverage expansions, and the aging of the population, drive faster projected growth in health spending in 2014 and beyond,\u201d says CMS. \u201cBy 2022, the ACA is projected to reduce the number of uninsured people by 30 million, add approximately 0.1 percentage-point to average annual health spending growth over the full projection period, and increase cumulative health spending by roughly $621 billion,\u201d CMS confirms.\n\nHimmelstein and Woolhandler note CMS projects over $2.7 trillion in spending for private insurance overhead and administering government health problems \u2013 predominately Medicare and Medicaid \u2013 between 2014 and 2022. This number includes $273 billion in new administrative costs associated with the ACA.\n\n\u201cMost of this soaring private insurance overhead is attributable to rising enrollment in private plans which carry high costs for administration and profits,\u201d the researchers explain.\n\nPublic insurance simply provides more bang for your buck, Himmelstein and Woolhandler state. The administrative costs associated with the ACA are steep, especially compared to more economically efficient alternatives, the researchers maintain. Traditional Medicare, for instance, exhibits a 2 percent overhead, they say.\n\nThe accuracy of this overhead number has been debated within the healthcare industry. There is not a lot of attention devoted to Medicare\u2019s overhead costs, says the Physicians for a National Health Program (PNHP). Confusion abounds due to conflicting government reports and to the possibility that Medicare\u2019s overhead costs may not be accurately reported by the government. Research asserts there is no tangible documentation behind such estimates.\n\nNonetheless, savings are tangible. \u201cTraditional Medicare is a bargain compared to the ACA strategy of filtering most of the new dollars through private insurers and private HMOs that subcontract for much of the new Medicaid coverage,\u201d according to Himmelstein and Woolhandler. If the ACA-based 22.5 percent overhead figure decreased to match the traditional Medicare level, projected savings would result in nearly $250 billion by 2002, Himmelstein and Woolhandler claim.\n\n\u201cBetween 2014 and 2022, the ACA will add $273.6 billion in new administrative costs over and above what would have been expected had the law not been enacted,\u201d states Himmelstein. \u201cThat's equivalent to $1,375 per newly insured person per year, or 22.5 percent of total federal expenditures for the program.\u201d\n\nHimmelstein and Woolhandler maintain that approximately two-thirds of this new overhead \u2013 over $172 billion \u2013 is connected to private insurers\u2019 administrative costs and profits. Remaining added overhead, they explain, \u201cis attributable to expanded government programs, i.e. Medicaid. But even the added dollars to administer Medicaid will flow mostly to private Medicaid HMOs, which will account for 59 percent of total Medicaid administrative costs in 2022.\u201d\n\nAdministrative costs represent a minor fraction of total healthcare expenses. Says Woolhandler, the numbers presented are \u201cshocking\u201d and are only now being brought to light for the very first time. The bureaucracy will eat up almost a quarter of federal spending, she maintains.\n\nThe active need to lessen administrative financial waste is a tangible yet massively far-reaching goal the healthcare industry should collectively focus on.
