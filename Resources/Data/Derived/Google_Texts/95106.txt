This month, the “Take Charge of Your Health Today” page focuses on health insurance and the importance of enrollment. Vianca Masucci, health advocate at the Urban League of Greater Pittsburgh, and Esther L. Bush, president and CEO of the Urban League of Greater Pittsburgh, exchanged ideas on this topic.

VM: Good morning, Ms. Bush. It’s always a pleasure to see you, especially when we get an opportunity to talk about health insurance. It’s a topic that’s getting a lot of national attention.

EB: Since the Affordable Care Act (ACA) has been passed, health insurance is all you hear about. And I personally think that’s a good thing! Before the ACA, there were only a handful of ways to get affordable health insurance. Now, in states like Pennsylvania that have decided to expand Medicaid, there are great opportunities for people to get covered. Everyone should take advantage of these opportunities.
