Organizers with Heroes Behind the Badges Blood Drive want to attract between 800 and 1,000 donors in the coming days.\n\nCommunity Blood Bank of Sioux Falls needs 550 units of blood a week. Even though there\u2019s an increase this time of year, an overall demand continues year round, whether or not people find the time to donate blood.\n\n\"Our hope is that we generate a lot of new donors so that we start seeing them come in to donate more on a regular basis,\" Ken Versteeg said.\n\nThat's Versteeg's goal and others with Community Blood Bank as they put on the drive. Firefighters and police compete with each other over the next couple weeks to see who can recruit more blood donors.\n\n\"Saw the fire truck outside,\" Robbie Ness said. \"I'm a volunteer fire fighter so I figured I'll do my good deed and support the fire department here in Sioux Falls and donate blood for a good cause.\"\n\nOrganizers want the drive to draw enough blood to match what's used during the event's two weeks. Organizations, including Community Blood Bank, conduct similar drives throughout the state. This one's been going on nearly 20 years.\n\n\"It kind of grew through the 19 years where we started with maybe a little over 100 donations. Now we're nearly over 1,000 donations between the two weeks that we operate,\" Versteeg said.\n\nCommunity Blood Bank has successfully conducted police verses fire blood drives in smaller communities in the region as well. Versteeg says the events lead to a 15 to 20 percent new donor base.\n\n\"I was glad I was able to find time to donate blood, and hopefully in the future I'll find more time,\" Ness said.\n\nThe blood drive continues into the beginning of January and offers some incentives for people wanting to donate.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "KELOLAND News", "description": "A two-week blood drive in Sioux Falls is helping during a high-demand time.
