The Arizona Republican Party has formally censured Sen. John McCain, citing a voting record that they say is insufficiently conservative.

State party spokesman Tim Sifert says the resolution to censure McCain was approved by a voice-vote Saturday during a meeting of state committee members in Tempe. The resolution needed signatures from at least 20 percent of state committee members to reach the floor for debate.

Sifert says no further action is expected.

McCain spokesman Brian Rogers declined to comment on the censure.

According to the resolution, the 2008 Republican presidential candidate has campaigned as a conservative but has lent his support to issues such as immigration reform and to funding the law sometimes known as Obamacare.

Several Republican county committees recently censured McCain.
