Government assistance is no longer a temporary condition, but has become a way of life.\n\nAt the same time, big government spending has created $18 trillion dollars in national debt and there appears to be no end in sight. Entitlements and government spending are on an unsustainable course.\n\nThe easy answer to this problem is to stop spending.\n\nMany will say that America needs tax reform or a balanced-budget amendment. Although these are good ideas, Dr. Jerome Huyler, explains in his book, \u201cThe Case Against Welfare,\u201d the best way to correct the problem is to defund Obamacare and dismantle the welfare state. This includes anti-poverty programs, earmarks, business bailouts, farm subsidies and many other entitlements.\n\nGovernment, in its original intent, was not designed to benefit some at the expense of others.\n\nThomas Jefferson said,\n\n\u201cThe first principle of society is a guarantee of the free exercise of industry and possession of the fruits acquired by it.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Government\u2019s primary responsibility is to protect, not provide for, us. America is the most compassionate nation in the world and, with a thriving economy unencumbered by a myriad of government entitlements and programs, would certainly be more than capable of taking care of its citizens who cannot take care of themselves.\n\nGraceland Radio: Insightful interviews and sharp commentary covering the day\u2019s top stories with a lot of heart and soul.
