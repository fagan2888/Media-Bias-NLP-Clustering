So where does that leave reformers and physicians?\n\nMalpractice reformers have pursued many strategies in an attempt to rein in the nation\u2019s malpractice costs and craft a system that benefits physicians, patients and the healthcare system as a whole. A growing body of evidence suggests that many \u201ctort reform\u201d efforts simply don\u2019t accomplish what they\u2019re intended to.\n\nIn fact, earlier this year the American College of Physicians (ACP) released a detailed position paper on malpractice reform that revisits many old ideas, according to some experts who follow reform efforts.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty standard list of tort reform proposals,\u201d says David Orentlicher, J.D., codirector of the Hall Center for Law and Health at the Indiana University McKinney School of Law.\n\nAnother malpractice expert goes further. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing new here. Some of this stuff is literally decades old,\u201d says Keith Hebeisen, J.D., former chairman of the American Bar Association\u2019s Standing Committee on Medical Professional Liability.\n\nEven the \u201cnewer\u201d reforms on the ACP\u2019s list typically are at least 10 years old, though some, such as safe harbors, have not been tried much in the United States, says Allen Kachalia, J.D., associate professor at the Harvard School of Public Health.\n\n\n\nPatient safety\n\nIn its first recommendation, the ACP paper nods to quality control, then switches to \u201cWe should make it harder to sue doctors,\u201d followed by suggestions how, says Bernard S. Black, J.D., of Northwestern University\u2019s School of Law and Kellogg School of Management. \u201cWe don\u2019t learn from our mistakes,\u201d he says. \u201cWe need incentives for safety that are stronger than what we have now.\u201d\n\nFor example, Black suggests, if a hospital makes a mistake, it should have to fix it at no cost to the patient. As things stand now, he says, \u201cHospitals get paid more if patients get complications.\u201d\n\nOrentlicher agrees with the paper\u2019s emphasis on patient safety, but adds, \u201cThe medical profession hasn\u2019t done enough to police itself.\u201d\n\nOn a more positive note, both men like the ABIM Foundation\u2019s Choosing Wisely campaign that aims to help patients choose care that is supported by evidence, does not duplicate other tests or procedures, is free from harm and is truly necessary.\n\nNext: Damage caps", "article_metadata": {"DC.description": "Is tort reform capable of achieving gains for physicians when it comes to medical liability?
