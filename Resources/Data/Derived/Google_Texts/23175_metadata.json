Most of the housing business in the region is in the rental sector, according to experts, and people are not moving to the Inland Empire from outside areas.\n\nThe logistics sector, which includes warehousing and trucking goods, will continue to grow in the Inland Empire thanks to cheaper land and available space, the increase of goods being shipped and handled at the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles, the growth of online shopping, and the strong dollar encouraging more imports.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition, the return of local control of the Los Angeles/Ontario International Airport is expected to help spur additional economic growth for the region, with plans for new logistics-based development around the airport.\n\nJay Prag, professor of economics and finance at the Drucker School of Management at Claremont Graduate University, said that while employment is booming, wage numbers are not quite as good.\n\n\u201cThe logistics jobs that replaced the construction jobs, don\u2019t pay nearly as well as construction,\u201d Prag said. \u201cThe logistics jobs are a lot less permanent because we are highly dependent on goods trade commitments with China and other exporter/importers.\u201d\n\nThe strong dollar, while helping logistics, is hurting manufacturing, which has experienced tepid growth in the region, according to industry watchers.\n\n\u201cBecause the value of the dollar is so strong, it means that if I\u2019m an exporter, my products cost more to my customers worldwide,\u201d Husing said.\n\nHusing also said the health care sector is expected to create more jobs because of the Affordable Care Act, which has increased the number of people seeking healthcare.\n\n\u201cMany more people are covered and therefore there is the need for many more people to work in that sector,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "ONTARIO >> Stellar employment growth, expansion of the logistics industry and e-commerce in the Inland Empire, and local", "title": "Inland Empire economist touts regional job growth, but wages lag a bit", "og": {"url": "http://www.sbsun.com/business/20160324/inland-empire-economist-touts-regional-job-growth-but-wages-lag-a-bit", "image": {"width": "512px", "identifier": "http://local.sbsun.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/sbsun_new.png", "height": "512px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Inland Empire economist touts regional job growth, but wages lag a bit"}, "twitter": {"domain": "sbsun.com", "description": "ONTARIO >> Stellar employment growth, expansion of the logistics industry and e-commerce in the Inland Empire, and local", "title": "Inland Empire economist touts regional job growth, but wages lag a bit", "url": "http://www.sbsun.com/business/20160324/inland-empire-economist-touts-regional-job-growth-but-wages-lag-a-bit", "image": {"src": "http://local.sbsun.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/sbsun.png?052016"}, "site": "@sbsun", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id563372734", "iphone": "id503662617", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.sanbernardinosun"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "daily,Economy,ieep,Inland Empire,inland empire economic partnership,Jobs,jobs data,John Husing, Economic outlook", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "daily,Economy,ieep,Inland Empire,inland empire economic partnership,Jobs,jobs data,John Husing, Economic outlook"}, "article_summary": "Total local jobs, he said, is expected to increase to 1.4 million for the Inland Empire when his projection of 48,700 jobs are created this year.\n\u201cThe logistics jobs that replaced the construction jobs, don\u2019t pay nearly as well as construction,\u201d Prag said.\nONTARIO >> Stellar employment growth, expansion of the logistics industry and e-commerce in the Inland Empire, and local control of the Ontario airport are key highlights for the regional economy, Inland Empire economist John Husing said at his annual keynote speech.\nHusing said he expects the Inland Empire to reach a 5 percent unemployment rate this year, which is considered \u201cfull employment\u201d for the local economy.\nA major key takeaway from Husing\u2019s address \u2014 hosted by the Inland Empire Economic Partnership business advocacy group, for which Husing serves as chief economist \u2014 was that the Inland Empire had become a key job growth center in the entire state, coming second only to Los Angeles County."}
