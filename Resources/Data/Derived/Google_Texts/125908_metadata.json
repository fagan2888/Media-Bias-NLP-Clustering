Joe Barton (R-Texas) thinks his bill to repeal a decades-old ban on crude oil exports would have an \u201cexcellent chance\u201d of passing the House and Senate next year.\n\n\u201cI do think in the next Congress we\u2019ve got an excellent chance either as a stand alone or as a part of a larger bill and I think it will be bipartisan,\u201d Barton told reporters on Tuesday.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cI think we will have a lot of Republicans and a lot of Democrats\u201d behind it, he added.\n\nBarton will unveil his legislation on Tuesday ahead of a Thursday hearing by the Energy and Commerce subcommittee on Energy and Power, which will focus on oil exports.\n\nHe admitted there is work to be done on educating other lawmakers about the issue. Barton has spoken to Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Fred Upton (R-Mich.), who he said is open to having a discussion about exports.\n\n\u201cHe has not committed to it one way or another, but he is receptive,\u201d Barton said of Upton.\n\nA number of lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have yet to weigh in on the issue of expanding oil exports, as there are concerns surrounding the impact on consumers and refiners.\n\n\u201cThe argument against it is more of a regional argument if you have big refineries, some of the refineries are against it but they are not vociferously against it because over time they will benefit,\u201d Barton said.\n\nThe chairman of the Energy and Power subcommittee holding Thursday\u2019s hearing, Rep. Ed Whitfield Ed WhitfieldEPA finalizes stronger methane emission rules \u2018It\u2019s a King Kong vs. Godzilla kind of race\u2019 House committee passes pipeline safety bill MORE (R-Ky.), has yet to say whether he supports lifting the 40-year-old ban.\n\n\u201cI am open minded about it right now. I haven\u2019t really made a public decision about where I think I am on it, but hopefully after one or two of these hearings I\u2019ll have a better idea,\u201d he told The Hill on Tuesday.\n\nWhitfield said a majority of the Republican conference is \u201creally focusing on the issue now\u201d however, and hopes the hearing will provide a better picture of possible impacts.\n\n\u201cThese hearings we hope will give us a better understanding of No.1 whether or not we need legislation, and No. 2 the long-term or short-term consequences of passing legislation and the impact that will have on the American people,\u201d Whitfield said.\n\nThe recent move by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries not to cut production, Whitfield said, puts more pressure on U.S. producers, which means there is \u201cprobably going to be more pressure to allow exports.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I think all of us who have a responsibility for passing legislation would want to have a better understanding of really what are the consequences of this,\u201d he added.\n\nSupport for lifting the ban has grown in the Senate with Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) taking the lead on the issue.\n\nMurkowski, unlike Barton, is pressing the administration to take executive action rather than pursue legislation that lifts the ban outright.\n\nBarton said on Tuesday that he thinks legislation is the \u201ccleaner\u201d route rather than leaving it to the Commerce Department to approve exports for certain companies on a case-by-case basis.\n\n\u201cIt would be much cleaner to just change the basic underlying law,\u201d Barton said, adding that he is open to talking with his Senate colleagues about more options.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Rep.
