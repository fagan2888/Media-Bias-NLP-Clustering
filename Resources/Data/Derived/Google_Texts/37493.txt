Sunday night was the annual Miss Universe pageant, and this year's edition had quite possibly the strangest ending of any pageant in the history of the, well, universe.

After announcing Miss Colombia, Ariadna Gutierrez Arevalo, as the winner, host Steve Harvey came back onto the stage to announce that he had made a mistake and that Miss Philippines, Pia Wurtzbach, had actually won.

Painful.

It was later revealed on the Miss Universe's Snapchat account that the teleprompter had mistakenly said that Miss Colombia was the winner.

Following that debacle, Twitter users were quick to joke that the winner was always announced correctly when Donald Trump owned the pageant. (Trump sold the organization to WME-IMG in September 2015 following NBC's refusal to air the pageant after Trump's comments regarding Mexicans and illegal immigration.)
