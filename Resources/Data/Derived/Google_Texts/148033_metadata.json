At the same time, publicly held debt will hold fairly steady at around 74 percent of gross domestic product by the end of the current fiscal year, a slight improvement over the previous year.\n\nRelated: New CBO Director Renews Warning on Long-Term Debt\n\nThe Obama administration for months has been hailing its success in controlling a deficit that breached $1 trillion a year during the worst of the financial crisis and recession. Indeed, the new projections for the fiscal 2015 deficit would represent the smallest since 2007. \u201cAnd at 2.4 percent of gross domestic product, it would be below the average deficit \u2014 relative to the size of the economy \u2014 over the past 50 years,\u201d the CBO pointed out.\n\nOne reason that things are looking up on the deficit front is that federal revenues are expected to rise by 8 percent this year, to $3.3 trillion or 18.2 percent of the overall economy. In particular, tax receipts from corporate and individual taxes turned out to be greater than anticipated.\n\nAt the same time, federal spending is projected to climb by 5 percent this year to a total of $3.7 trillion, or roughly 20 percent of the overall economy. That increase is the result of nearly a 10 percent increase in mandatory spending on Social Security, Medicare and other entitlements, offset by lower net interest payments on the debt and domestic and defense outlays.\n\nAccording to the revised CBO baseline projections, the deficit will dip to $414 billion next year as the economy continues to improve but then will begin to rise substantially, to $1 trillion by 2025 absent any major change in existing tax and spending legislation. As policy experts have repeatedly warned, without significant changes in entitlement spending, the growth in retirement and health care programs for seniors and interest on the federal debt will far outpace growth in revenues down the road.\n\nRelated: CBO Says Long Term Debt Poses \u2018Serious Negative Consequences\u2019\n\nOn the economic front, CBO says that the economy will grow \u201cmodestly\u201d for the remainder of this year before picking up steam over the next few years. Assuming no change in current policy, the CBO is projecting that real GDP will grow by 2.0 percent this calendar year, 3.1 percent in 2016 and 2.7 percent in 2017. Then the economy will grow by an average yearly rate of 2.2 percent in 2018 and 2019, according to the budget agency.\n\nSenate Budget Committee Chair Mike Enzi (R-WY) said in a statement that the CBO findings illustrates \u201cthe tremendous impact the budget caps approved as part of the 2011 Budget Control Act have had on our overspending.\u201d He added, however, that \u201cOur nation\u2019s long-term debt is not so rosy,\u201d and he urged lawmakers from both parties not to use the report as an excuse to boost spending in the coming year.\n\nRelated: Four Political Issues That Could Tank the Markets\n\nCongress has been operating under a two-year budget deal that temporarily lifted stringent caps on domestic and defense spending, but that is due to expire at the end of this fiscal year.\n\nThe Obama administration and congressional Democrats are pressing the Republican majority in Congress to continue to hold the caps in abeyance in the coming year to provide additional spending on both defense and domestic programs. Enzi and other conservative favor preserving the caps, which sets the stage for a major budget tussle this fall before the start of the new fiscal year.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "As the stock market began recovering from its \u201cBlack Monday\u201d upheaval, the non-partisa", "title": "As Tax Payments Rise, 2015 Deficit Will Be Smallest in 8 Years", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/08/25/Tax-Payments-Rise-2015-Deficit-Will-Be-Smallest-8-Years", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/01312012_CBO_Deficit_Projections_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/08/25/Tax-Payments-Rise-2015-Deficit-Will-Be-Smallest-8-Years", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/01312012_CBO_Deficit_Projections_article.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "As the stock market began recovering from its \u201cBlack Monday\u201d upheaval, the non-partisa", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Indeed, the new projections for the fiscal 2015 deficit would represent the smallest since 2007.\nThen the economy will grow by an average yearly rate of 2.2 percent in 2018 and 2019, according to the budget agency.\nIn particular, tax receipts from corporate and individual taxes turned out to be greater than anticipated.\nOne reason that things are looking up on the deficit front is that federal revenues are expected to rise by 8 percent this year, to $3.3 trillion or 18.2 percent of the overall economy.\n\u201cAnd at 2.4 percent of gross domestic product, it would be below the average deficit \u2014 relative to the size of the economy \u2014 over the past 50 years,\u201d the CBO pointed out."}
