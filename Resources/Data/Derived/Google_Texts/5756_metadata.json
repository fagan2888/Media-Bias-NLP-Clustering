Tom Cotton said Monday that Sen. Mark Pryor isn\u2019t \u201ctough enough\u201d to stand up to President Obama, using a debate to repeatedly link the incumbent Democrat to the unpopular president.\n\nHe accused Mr. Pryor of voting to defend Obamacare, backing the White House\u2019s agenda on the economy and its plans for combatting the resurgence of terrorists in Iraq.\n\n\u201cWhenever Barack Obama says he needs Senator Pryor\u2019s vote, then he gets Senator Pryor\u2019s vote,\u201d Mr. Cotton said during the 90-minute debate at the University of Central Arkansas. \u201cLeadership requires toughness, requires courage. Senator Pryor simply isn\u2019t tough enough to stand up to Barack Obama and put Arkansas first.\u201d\n\nSEE ALSO: Mark Pryor fumbles question on Obama\u2019s Ebola plan\n\nTaking a page from other Senate challengers in red states, Mr. Cotton is banking that dissatisfaction with Mr. Obama and his policies will help propel him to victory in Arkansas and give the GOP a pickup as they try to wrest control of the Senate from Democrats. Mr. Cotton has a slight edge in recent public polling in a race awash with negative advertising and more than $27 million in spending by outside groups.\n\nMr. Pryor fired back, saying that Mr. Cotton is trying to hide his own record under a barrage of attacks on Mr. Obama.\n\n\u201cYou see a pattern? Yes,\u201d he said. \u201cClearly, Congressman Cotton is running against one man, but I\u2019m running for three million Arkansans. That\u2019s what this race is all about and that\u2019s the difference in this race.\u201d\n\nSEE ALSO: Elizabeth Warren nod could prove critical as Democrats eye 2016\n\nIn the heavily agricultural state, Mr. Pryor accused Mr. Cotton of being beholden to billionaire donors and said the freshman congressman\u2019s vote against the farm bill this year was a vote against the interests of farmers in the state.\n\nMr. Pryor said that while he supports some changes to Obamacare, he doesn\u2019t want to go back to the days before it was passed in 2010 when health insurance companies could, for example, deny coverage for people who have pre-existing conditions.\n\nHe pointed to his own experience needing health care, and attacked Mr. Cotton\u2019s support for a \u201chigh-risk pool\u201d to help those who otherwise can\u2019t find coverage.\n\n\u201cLet me tell you something, congressman: I\u2019m a cancer survivor,\u201d said Mr. Pryor. \u201cI\u2019ve lived this. I\u2019ve been in [a] high-risk pool. It is not a good place to be.\u201d\n\nArkansas has been among the top states in the country in terms of trimming its uninsured rate, and the state pioneered a \u201cprivate option\u201d to expand Medicaid by leveraging federal dollars under Obamacare to buy regular health insurance for its expansion population instead of dumping them into the government health program.\n\nAs for Mr. Obama\u2019s terror tack, Mr. Pryor said he backed arming the moderate Syrian opposition as part of the Obama administration\u2019s long-term solution to combat the Islamic State terrorist group.\n\nMr. Cotton, a combat veteran of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, said Mr. Obama should have left open the possibility of using ground troops.\n\nThe only member of the Arkansas congressional delegation to vote against the final version of the farm bill, Mr. Cotton called the measure a \u201cbad deal\u201d for Arkansas farmers and taxpayers. He said he supported provisions intended to help farmers, but opposed the billions of dollars the farm bill sent to the food stamp program.\n\nLibertarian Nathan LaFrance and Green Party candidate Mark Swaney also participated in the debate Monday. Mr. Pryor and Mr. Cotton are scheduled to debate one-on-one Tuesday evening in Fayetteville.", "article_metadata": {"description": "GOP Rep. Tom Cotton said Monday that Democratic Sen.
