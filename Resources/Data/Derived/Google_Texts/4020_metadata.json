With a tight deadline, my story heading into the third period was about the Avs\u2019 high-priced forwards again not getting it done, and with two unsuspecting guys without an NHL goal on the season \u2014 defenseman Nate Guenin and rookie F Borna Rendulic \u2014 lighting the lamp to fuel the victory. But after Vincent Lacavalier and Claude Giroux made great plays/shots to give the Flyers a 3-2 lead, the frantic running game story that\u2019s filed before or at the buzzer turned to this: Patrick Roy\u2019s outspoken frustration about his top forwards continues.\n\nHowever, Jarome Iginla forced my third re-write with a spectacular shot on a late power play and adjustments were made after Ryan O\u2019Reilly\u2019s overtime goal with 19.9 seconds remaining before the shootout. Avs win, fueled by their top-scoring forwards! The hastily written game story (filed at the buzzer with quotes from the locker room added) is here, although you might find significant information is below. Such as:\n\n\u2014 Iginla, Rendulic, O\u2019Reilly and defenseman Jan Hejda \u2014 who blocked two shots, the latter while \u201cselling\u201d out in a sideways position that often causes injury \u2014 were the last players to take off their equipment and join their teammates in the suit-and-tie room that\u2019s off-limits to the media. This is what happens when a team victory occurs, with multiple guys playing big roles. They take their time getting their skates and other equipment off, and are easily approachable even after they had talked in a media scrum. It was like last season.\n\nRyan O\u2019Reilly scored his fifth career regular season OT goal (plus one in the playoffs) and his five OT winners rank fourth on the franchise\u2019s all-time list:\n\n\n\n\u2014 By all accounts, this was a good victory over a good opponent. Philly had lost its two previous games but had collected points in nine of 10 before that. Iginla talked extensively about the similarities and urgency with both teams. \u201cBoth teams are in similar positions, both are desperate, we need to move up,\u201d Iggy said. \u201cIn the third, getting behind, it was good to stick with it and find a way to score some goals as a team. It\u2019s been tight for us. Good way to end the year.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Through an Altitude producer, I learned Michael Del Zotto indeed suffered a nasty gash from his left ear to his cheek from Daniel Briere\u2019s skate blade, and was evaluated and took stitches in the X-ray room after the first period. Apparently, the cut didn\u2019t immediately bleed, which is why we thought it wasn\u2019t serious. Altitude did a post-game interview with Del Zotto, and although I can\u2019t locate it, his gash is significant and another reminder of how dangerous this game can be. Del Zotto was seriously cut in the chest/stomach by Evgeni Malkin\u2019s skate blade in 2010, while playing for the New York Rangers.\n\n\u2014 Matt Duchene continues to be the most frustrated Av. The first-line center extended his goalless drought to eight games, and has just two in his last 13. He had just one shot in 17:20 against Philly. \u201cIt\u2019s not an easy situation for Dutchy but I\u2019m very confident (in his resolve),\u201d Roy said. \u201cHe\u2019s working hard at it. Every day he comes to the rink, he\u2019s asking questions, he does a lot of video with (Timmy) Army and I. He really wants to perform well. He\u2019s the heart of this organization and that logo. He\u2019s playing with a lot of pride and unfortunately for him it\u2019s not going his way.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Here\u2019s what Hejda said about his two late blocked shots: \u201cIt\u2019s something you have to do in the playoffs, and this is the playoffs for us.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Guenin, on his \u201cmagic\u201d shot that went through three Flyers and two teammates before landing in the net behind goalie Steve Mason: \u201cI was trying to get the first guy to bite and then get it through. It worked.\u201d\n\n\u2014 To \u201cJoe,\u201d the guy who approached my son and gave him a complimentary fourth-row seat in section 120 while he was prepared to buy a $40 ticket and sit by himself: Please email me, I\u2019d like to thank you and wish you happy New Year.", "article_metadata": {"Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "All Things Avalanche", "description": "Postgame: Iginla and O'Reilly save the last night of 2014 for Avalanche in 4-3 overtime victory over Flyers.", "title": "Avs' Iginla and O'Reilly deliver late in 4-3 OT win over Philly", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/avs/2015/01/01/postgame-iginla-oreilly-save-last-night-2014-avalanche/20481/", "image": "http://local.denverpost.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/denverpost.png?v=21060130", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Postgame: Iginla and O'Reilly save the last night of 2014 for Avalanche in 4-3 overtime victory over Flyers.", "creator": "@mikechambers", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/avs/2015/01/01/postgame-iginla-oreilly-save-last-night-2014-avalanche/20481/", "image": "http://local.denverpost.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/denverpost.png?v=21060130", "title": "Postgame: Iginla and O\u2019Reilly save the last night of 2014 for Avalanche", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "news_keywords": "Colorado Avalanche,Jarome Iginla,Matt Duchene,Nate Guenin,NHL,Patrick Roy,Philadelphia Flyers,Ryan O'Reilly", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Postgame: Iginla and O'Reilly save the last night of 2014 for Avalanche in 4-3 overtime victory over Flyers."}, "article_summary": "Ryan O\u2019Reilly scored his fifth career regular season OT goal (plus one in the playoffs) and his five OT winners rank fourth on the franchise\u2019s all-time list:\u2014 By all accounts, this was a good victory over a good opponent.\nPhilly had lost its two previous games but had collected points in nine of 10 before that.\nHowever, Jarome Iginla forced my third re-write with a spectacular shot on a late power play and adjustments were made after Ryan O\u2019Reilly\u2019s overtime goal with 19.9 seconds remaining before the shootout.\nEvery day he comes to the rink, he\u2019s asking questions, he does a lot of video with (Timmy) Army and I.\nDel Zotto was seriously cut in the chest/stomach by Evgeni Malkin\u2019s skate blade in 2010, while playing for the New York Rangers."}
