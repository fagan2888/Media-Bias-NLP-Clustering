They\u2019re grappling with soaring expenses of medications including cancer drugs that can cost each patient more than $100,000 a year, according to Reuters.\n\nAfrica is an attractive expansion target for Cigna, said Bart Jordens, general manager of Cigna Africa and international organisations.\n\nCignaAfrica claims to have more than 200,000 members in Africa and infrastructure in place for more, including case managers in South Africa and Kenya, a new office in Kenya and an outpatient network with local health care providers, according to its website.\n\nThe Cigna Global Health Benefits product for expats includes health benefits, dental and vision coverage, and evacuation and health management services specifically for staff that works locally in Africa but is globally mobile, the report said.\n\nIn sub-Saharan Africa, Cigna\u2019s customers include employees of non-profits and intergovernmental organizations. The company says it hires local medical consultants and local communication officers in key hubs and in its claims intake office in Kenya.\n\n\u201cWith our already existing infrastructure and experience in Africa, we are in a good position,\u201d Jordens said.\n\nIn July, U.S.-based Cigna Corp. agreed to be bought by U.S.-based Anthem Inc. for $48 billion, a deal that will combine the second- and fifth-largest health insurers by revenue. The new company will have a huge footprint in commercial insurance, the type of coverage provided to employers and consumers, WallStreetJournal reported.\n\nThe deal is expected to be completed in 2016.\n\nIt\u2019s part of a merger frenzy among top U.S. health insurers that could result in a dramatic reshaping of the industry, WSJ reported. Aetna Inc. has also agreed to buy Humana Inc. for $34 billion.\n\nThe Cigna-Anthem deal will create the largest U.S. health insurer by membership and accelerate the industry\u2019s consolidation from five national players to three in the U.S., according to Reuters.\n\nOf the major U.S. health insurers, only UnitedHealth Group Inc., the largest of the U.S. insurers by revenue, is sitting out the merger wave, at least so far, WSJ reported in July.\n\nSign up for the AFKInsider newsletter \u2014 the most compelling business news you need to know from Africa and the African diaspora, delivered straight to your inbox.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As U.S.-based health insurance companies undergo dramatic changes at home, one of the top five, Cigna, is expanding health insurance to Africa for expats.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "AFKInsider", "description": "As U.S.-based health insurance companies undergo dramatic changes at home, one of the top five, Cigna, is expanding health insurance to Africa for expats.", "title": "Cigna Expanding Health Insurance To Africa For Expats", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 620, "identifier": "http://d34elvfuwuckt2.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2015/10/164ee9e13779991f53bd1f9e15f55ae5_L.jpg", "height": 349}, "updated_time": "2015-10-09T10:13:59-04:00", "url": "http://afkinsider.com/104599/cigna-expanding-health-insurance-to-africa-for-expats/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@AFKInsider", "image": {"src": "http://d34elvfuwuckt2.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2015/10/164ee9e13779991f53bd1f9e15f55ae5_L.jpg"}, "description": "As U.S.-based health insurance companies undergo dramatic changes at home, one of the top five, Cigna, is expanding health coverage to Africa for expats, according to a report in", "card": "summary", "title": "Cigna Expanding Health Insurance To Africa For Expats"}, "robots": "noodp", "google-translate-customization": "d801d772fea2d3df-0efa19324cba2605-g1098bad8dda89227-e", "ob": {"title": "Cigna Expanding Health Insurance To Africa Fo"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "article": {"section": "Business", "tag": "Obamacare", "published_time": "2015-10-09T10:11:45-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-09T10:13:59-04:00", "author": "http://afkinsider.com/author/dflsanchez/"}, "google-site-verification": "UtGzZuQZqeamQriIeIKv4PeAmgQrgWTjvPY-s-aHSH4"}, "article_summary": "Africa is an attractive expansion target for Cigna, said Bart Jordens, general manager of Cigna Africa and international organisations.\nPhoto: ipmimagazineAs U.S.-based health insurance companies undergo dramatic changes at home, one of the top five, Cigna, is expanding health coverage to Africa for expats, according to a report in RelocateMagazine.\nU.S. health insurers are finding it tougher to raise prices following the roll-out of Obamacare, President Barack Obama\u2019s healthcare law.\nThe Cigna Global Health Benefits product for expats includes health benefits, dental and vision coverage, and evacuation and health management services specifically for staff that works locally in Africa but is globally mobile, the report said.\nIn July, U.S.-based Cigna Corp. agreed to be bought by U.S.-based Anthem Inc. for $48 billion, a deal that will combine the second- and fifth-largest health insurers by revenue."}
