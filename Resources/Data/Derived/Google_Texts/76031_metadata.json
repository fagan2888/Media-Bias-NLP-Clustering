For the other half of the uninsured population, however, the ACA has less to offer. Subsidies in the ACA private plan marketplace get skimpier at 200% FPL, and fade out altogether at 400% FPL \u2013 or lower, for many applicants.\n\nThat\u2019s a policy problem \u2013 and a political problem for Democrats. Bernie Sanders wants to start over, and build a Big Rock Candy Mountain of unlimited health benefits for all, with no premiums or copays. Hillary Clinton, characteristically, is serving up a more targeted menu of supplements and sweeteners to ACA subsidies.\n\nHer wish list has something for people at all points in the income distribution, very much including those at the top of it. In fact, in a recent conversation with voters, she emphasized helping those who earn too much to qualify for current ACA subsidies:\n\nShe also discussed her proposal to ease the cutoff point for Affordable Care Act subsidies, which the law makes available to Americans making 400 percent of the federal poverty level.\n\nShe was responding to a question from a resident who complained that she\u2019s just above the cutoff level to enjoy subsidies on the Obamacare exchanges.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s just a cutoff, instead of what I\u2019d like to see which is a kind of gradual diminishment. People shouldn\u2019t just \u2013 once they get to a certain income level \u2013 shouldn\u2019t lose all their benefits,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cThat\u2019s something I\u2019m looking at.\u201d\n\nSweetening the Obamacare pot\n\nLet\u2019s look at what she\u2019s \u201clooking at\u201d to help the buyers who earn too much to qualify for subsidies. On her campaign website, Clinton proposes this package of ACA enhancements (my emphasis):\n\nHillary believes that in order to expand coverage for families, we need to reduce the cost of purchasing health insurance on the Affordable Care Act exchanges. Her plan will provide enhanced relief for people on the exchanges, and provide a tax credit of up to $5,000 per family to offset a portion of excessive out-of-pocket and premium costs above 5% of their income. She will enhance the premium tax credits now available through the exchanges so that those now eligible will pay less of a percentage of their income than under current law and ensure that all families purchasing on the exchange will not spend more than 8.5 percent of their income for premiums. Finally, she will fix the \u201cfamily glitch\u201d so that families can access coverage when their employer\u2019s family plan premium is too expensive.\n\nBoosting subsidies for those in the 200-400% FPL range would help a lot of people who have found ACA premiums unaffordable. The tax credit to reduce out-of-pocket costs would help those who have found themselves underinsured by plans covering just 60 percent or 70 percent of the average user\u2019s yearly costs.\n\nA cap with no cap\n\nIt\u2019s the 8.5 percent cap on premiums that is aimed primarily at those who currently don\u2019t qualify for any subsidy, though it would also help those at the upper end of subsidy range. As Clinton suggested, those just over the subsidy line can face a huge premium burden. That\u2019s mainly true for older buyers.\n\nWhile premium subsidies fade out gradually for young buyers, premiums are much higher for older adults \u2013 unless the subsidy covers the difference. A subsidized 21-year-old and 64-year-old earning 399% FPL will pay the same price for a benchmark Silver plan \u2013 but if they earn 401% FPL, the 64-year-old will pay three times as much. The difference is compounded if there is more than one person on the plan.\n\nThus, according to the Kaiser subsidy calculator, a pair of 55-year-olds earning 399% FPL will pay $513 for a benchmark Silver plan covering both of them \u2013 as will a pair of 27-year-olds. If the older couple earns 401% FPL, however, they\u2019ll pay $1,043 on average (though unsubsidized premiums vary widely by region). If they have to insure two kids, they\u2019ll pay an average of $1,340 \u2013 whereas if they earn 399% FPL ($96,757), they\u2019ll pay an average of just $770 for the four of them.\n\nAfflicting the fairly comfortable\n\nClinton\u2019s proposed subsidy enhancements seem to be based on a proposal published last summer by Urban Institute scholars Linda Blumberg and John Holahan. The authors proposed reducing private plan premiums and out-of-pocket costs at all income levels \u2013 and included the 8.5 percent cap. The cap was justified by Blumberg and Holahan\u2019s analysis of the cost burden faced by buyers of individual market health plans at various income levels.\n\nThe heaviest burden, in percentage terms, is borne by those in the 400-500% FPL range. The 8.5 percent cap provides significant relief to that level and beyond. Below, I\u2019ve charted how the cap would affect premiums (on average \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of regional variation) for current benchmark plans for a pair of 55-year-olds at different income levels.\n\nCost of average benchmark marketplace plan for two 55-year-olds:\n\nCurrent vs. with 8.5% income cap 300% FPL\n\n($47,790) 350% FPL\n\n($55,755) 399.9% FPL\n\n($63,710) 400% FPL\n\n($63,720) 500% FPL\n\n($79,650) 600% FPL\n\n($95,580) Subsidy with Avg US premium $658 $594 $530 $0 $0 $0 Avg US premium $385 $449 $513 $1,043 $1,043 $1,043 Premium wwith 8.5% cap $338 $394 $451 $451 $564 $677\n\nMost people would probably not object to easing the large bite that health insurance can take out of the income of the moderately affluent. Blumberg and Holahan aim their premium cap primarily at those within shouting range of the current 400% FPL subsidy cutoff, claiming that the cap \u201cwould not affect many of the higher income individuals potentially eligible for it because premiums would not reach that level relative to income for most of them.\u201d\n\nThat may be true for younger and mostly single shoppers. But with no limit to subsidy eligibility, an 8.5 percent cap on premiums would mean that our 55-year-old couple \u2013 paying the $1,043 average premium for benchmark Silver \u2013 would be subsidized up to an income of $147,247. That\u2019s 924% FPL. Two 64-year-olds subject to the average premium ($1,700 per month) would be subsidized up to an income of $240,000. That\u2019s 1,500% FPL.\n\nSubsidies would be minimal at that upper edge. Stepping back a bit, our 55-year-old couple earning 800% FPL ($127,440) would pay $902 per month under an 8.5 percent income cap. That\u2019s a monthly subsidy of $141. At 700% FPL ($111,510) the premium would be $790, the subsidy, $253.\n\nWhy subsidize the affluent?\n\nSubsidies at that income level may sound outrageous. But many affluent Americans who are insured through their employers actually get larger subsidies via the tax exclusion for employer-sponsored insurance, enjoyed by both the employer and the employee. And as the examples above illustrate, U.S. healthcare costs are so high that unsubsidized premiums take a disproportionate share of income even at many multiples of FPL.\n\nBlumberg and Holahan are probably right that the numbers of truly affluent people \u2013 say, over 600% FPL \u2013 taking advantage of the 8.5 percent cap would be relatively small. Remember that premiums are much lower for younger adults. For two 40-year-olds, the average unsubsidized monthly premium for benchmark Silver this year is $598. That\u2019s 8.5 percent of $84,423, or 529% FPL. And most of the affluent have access to employer-sponsored insurance, barring them from premium subsidies under current law.\n\nA bit more than a third of the uninsured had incomes above the level that would benefit from an 8.5 percent cap on premiums as of 2014, according to the Census Bureau. That suggests about 11 or 12 million in that category at present. Extending premium subsidies to them may make political sense, especially given the ACA\u2019s current skew toward those in the lower third of the income distribution.\n\nUpper middle class people vote, and Democrats are generally loathe to alienate them \u2013 as Obama\u2019s long-held promise not raise taxes on individuals making up to $200,000 and families up to $250,000 illustrates. Democrats paid in political blood to pass the ACA \u2013 but along that rocky road, thanks mainly to conservative Democrats in the Senate, they shorted the middle-middle, not to mention the upper middle, classes.\n\nThe current ACA subsidy schedule works reasonably well for those under 200% FPL, but it\u2019s too skimpy above the threshold (and arguably below it too). The exchanges would be more stable, with deeper risk pools and healthier enrollees on average, if the offerings were more attractive to prospective enrollees with incomes above 200% FPL.\n\nBut why not sweeten only up to 400% FPL \u2013 or perhaps, say, 500% \u2013 FPL? There is something to be said for a blanket principle such as \u201cno American household should have to spend more than 8.5 percent of income for adequate health insurance.\u201d\n\nBenefits that are at least potentially available to all generally win broader and more enduring support. Exhibit A is Medicare, which is subsidized to some degree for all Americans. While wealthier Americans do pay more for their Medicare benefits, the threshold for paying a higher share of the Part B premium (for doctor and outpatient care) is $170,000 for a couple and $85,000 for an individual \u2013 far above the subsidy cutoff for the ACA. If ACA benefits extended anywhere near that far up the income scale, the law might win an enduring place in Americans\u2019 affections.\n\n* It should be noted that this is not a measure of how many people have been newly insured by the ACA, as people in both categories (Medicaid and subsidized private plans) may have been previously insured, or might now be insured had there been no ACA. It\u2019s a measure of currently enrolled direct beneficiaries of the law.
