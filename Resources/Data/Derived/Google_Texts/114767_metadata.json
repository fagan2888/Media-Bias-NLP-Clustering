But this July, with the removal of all state marketing funding, regional economic development will make a significant shift as the Piedmont Triad Partnership begins operating as a private organization \u2014 one that no longer operates as a traditional economic development group, but rather a privately funded entity that\u2019s focused on specific regional goals of its own choosing.\n\nWith public funding eliminated, the Piedmont Triad Partnership is no longer bound by regionalism as historically defined by the state, nor the red tape that comes with it. Now accountable only to the elite few who pay to play on its executive team, PTP moves forward with a narrower agenda and a smaller footprint.\n\nIn this week\u2019s Business report, WFDD\u2019s Keri Brown interviews Triad Business Journal reporter Catherine Carlock about her cover story on the Piedmont Triad Partnership\u2019s challenges and its plans for future economic development projects in the region.\n\nCatherine Carlock is a reporter with the Triad Business Journal.
