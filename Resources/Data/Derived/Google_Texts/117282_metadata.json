Marco Rubio isn\u2019t sure if he\u2019ll ultimately vote for the Republican budget this week.\n\nThat uncertainty will not prevent the Florida senator from introducing at least 20 amendments that closely resemble the hawkish foreign policy and middle-class-focused domestic policy agenda he talked up in stump speeches last year on the trail.\n\nRubio\u2019s amendments cover everything from changes to welfare and school choice (issues he\u2019s been talking about around the country for months now) to increasing the defense budget and cutting foreign aid to groups in Palestine \u201cbecause of these entities\u2019 anti-Israel behavior and increasing foreign assistance for missile defense programs in Israel.\u201d\n\nThe Florida senator seems to be taking an early advantage of the opportunity to get some of his ideas onto the Republicans\u2019 budget \u2014 in a way other 2016 contenders are not. Sen. Ted Cruz, who launched his presidential bid earlier this week, has been traveling and not yet introduced anything as of Wednesday afternoon. A spokesman for Sen. Rand Paul said no decision had been made on if he\u2019d introduce anything.\n\nSenators often use the amendment process to put up legislation they can hail down the road in campaign ads (or force other senators to make uncomfortable votes).\n\nEven if Rubio gets everything he wants on the budget, though, he wouldn\u2019t commit to voting for the final product telling reporters Wednesday he has \u201cconcerns about a lot of the ways the numbers add up,\u201d and he was continuing to look at them. But even if he doesn\u2019t vote for it and some of his amendments will fail, it\u2019s an opportunity to lay down a real marker on where his priorities are heading into 2016.\n\nOther amendments Rubio will introduce include one dealing with religious freedom and another to repeal Obamacare\u2019s \u201crisk corridors\u201d\u2014 again, something Rubio has pushed for over a year. Rubio\u2019s first move was to introduce an amendment to increase defense spending along with Sen. Tom Cotton and he spoke on the floor to argue that \u201cdefense spending should be driven by the strategy.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn essence, to put it succinctly, we should not have a strategy that\u2019s based on limited resources: \u2018We\u2019re going to have to do the best we can with limited resources,\u2019\u201d Rubio said. \u201cWe should first outline a strategy.\u201d\n\nThe message in the amendment is clear: Rubio wants to been seen as serious about defense and his foreign policy credentials, and show what he plans to do about it. Rubio and Cotton\u2019s amendment would boost defense spending to numbers projected by former Defense Secretary Robert Gates in 2012 to $661 billion.\n\n\u201cIt increases the funding to the Gates number which is the last time a group of bipartisan experts told us what the defense needs were for our country,\u201d Rubio told reporters on Wednesday. \u201cWe\u2019ll hopefully get a vote on that and see how it plays out.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"bf": {"buzzid": 3735323, "userid": 686094}, "description": "The Florida senator has introduced more than 20 amendments to Republican budget that frame big pieces of his foreign (more defense...", "copyright": "Copyright 2016 BuzzFeed, Inc.
