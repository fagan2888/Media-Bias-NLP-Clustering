But he still rappelled down excitedly before heading toward the archery and fishing area.\n\nThe festival had hoped to bring \"non-traditional recreational activities\" such as rock climbing and archery to West Louisville, where there's less access to activities than in other parts of the city, said event coordinator Bennett Knox.\n\nThe latest budget passed by the Metro Council included $170,000 earmarked for the establishment of a center and development for nature-based recreation for West Louisville. Surveys out to festival-goers will help determine what kinds of programs stand out to locals.\n\n\"We want to introduce folks to what is possible,\" Knox said.\n\nSaturday's temperatures in the 90s didn't keep new archers away from Georgia Lacy and the archery range.\n\nAbout 50 people \u2014 most of whom had never shot \u2014 picked up bows, said Lacy, a seasonal staffer for Jefferson Memorial Forest.\n\n\"Nobody's been perfect yet, but we've had a couple bull's-eyes,\" Lacy said.\n\nChris Russ, an Indiana resident who works in West Louisville, was outscored by his 9-year-old daughter, who's been shooting with the Girl Scouts.\n\nRuss said he was impressed with how large and well-maintained the park was.\n\n\"I didn't even know all of this was back here,\" Russ said.\n\nNicholas Williams, at an obstacle course nearby, watched as a young woman on a bicycle took a sharp left turn on the hard plastic bike course.\n\nShe screamed as she cleared the ramp, but laughed as she left the course.\n\n\"I'm having so much fun it's doesn't even feel like I'm working,\" said Williams, a Kentucky State University senior.\n\nWindy conditions prevented Ohio River canoe rides that a lot of people \u2014 including Metro Councilwoman Cheri Bryant Hamilton \u2014 had been looking forward to. But Hamilton, who represents the district that includes the park, said she was glad the weather didn't disrupt the festival too much.\n\n\"A lot of kids are coming out and trying things they've never tried before, like the climbing wall and bicycle track,\" Williams said. \"I think it's going to build. I hope we do this every year.\"\n\nConstruction on the Shawnee Outdoor Learning Center will not start for another two or three years.\n\nReporter Michael McKay can be reached at (502) 582-4653 or on Twitter @MichaelMcKay716\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cjky.it/1mQxau1", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Ta'Quavious actually just misses the bar positioned at the top of the rock wall of the rock wall put up in Shawnee Park as part of Saturday's West Louisville Appreciation Festival, but he still repeled down excitedly before heading towards the archery and fishing area.", "og": {"site_name": "The Courier-Journal", "description": "Ta'Quavious actually just misses the bar positioned at the top of the rock wall of the rock wall put up in Shawnee Park as part of Saturday's West Louisville Appreciation Festival, but he still repeled down excitedly before heading towards the archery and fishing area.", "title": "West Louisville festival celebrates nature", "url": "http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/local/2014/07/26/west-louisville-festival-celebrates-nature/13219351/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/courier-journal.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ta'Quavious actually just misses the bar positioned at the top of the rock wall of the rock wall put up in Shawnee Park as part of Saturday's West Louisville Appreciation Festival, but he still repeled down excitedly before heading towards the archery and fishing area.", "creator": "@courierjournal", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a0dde32d957de3cdfac46501d8fb2ca59b292882/c=0-248-2508-2756&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Louisville/Louisville/2014/07/26/1406417542009-0726WestEndFestival010-DRL.JPG", "title": "West Louisville festival celebrates nature", "site": "@courierjournal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600030236", "fb": {"app_id": 128534137209813}, "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"category": "news/local", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/63f76051b65c64e009a1b9f55bd9abb324ebc596/c=83-0-2343-3000/local/-/media/Louisville/Louisville/2014/07/26/1406417542009-0726WestEndFestival010-DRL.JPG", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8f40c85113c8ca67b9b2026dcf63b097c6294d11/c=0-248-2508-2756/local/-/media/Louisville/Louisville/2014/07/26/1406417542009-0726WestEndFestival010-DRL.JPG", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c08e64c51286b16969210153de9557484079c58e/c=0-128-2508-2012/local/-/media/Louisville/Louisville/2014/07/26/1406417542009-0726WestEndFestival010-DRL.JPG", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/baacd5d1472358e70f20c7ea263b2c236be4464f/c=0-428-2508-1847&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/Louisville/Louisville/2014/07/26/1406417542009-0726WestEndFestival010-DRL.JPG", "publishtime": "2014-07-26T19:34:51.550000-04:00", "shorthed": "West Louisville locals get natural", "articleid": 13219351, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d042972343646c1a6bf19e778a2041e69ca9b3e8/c=0-428-2508-1847/local/-/media/Louisville/Louisville/2014/07/26/1406417542009-0726WestEndFestival010-DRL.JPG", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/fe76e002afabb5872046cc4573f65be560af3a5c/c=83-0-1765-3000/local/-/media/Louisville/Louisville/2014/07/26/1406417542009-0726WestEndFestival010-DRL.JPG"}, "author": "Michael McKay", "title": "West Louisville festival celebrates nature", "pageclass": "article", "gci-asset-type": "story"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Michael McKay, West Louisville, Shawnee Park"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce24e\"", "article_summary": "Both Love and Francis were part of the Love family tent at the Louisville Defender Newspaper\u00d5s West Louisville Appreciation Celebration & Proud Family Reunion.\nChris Russ, an Indiana resident who works in West Louisville, was outscored by his 9-year-old daughter, who's been shooting with the Girl Scouts.\nThe latest budget passed by the Metro Council included $170,000 earmarked for the establishment of a center and development for nature-based recreation for West Louisville.\nTa'Quavious actually just missed the bar positioned at the top of the rock wall put up in Shawnee Park as part of Saturday's West Louisville Appreciation Festival.\nThe festival had hoped to bring \"non-traditional recreational activities\" such as rock climbing and archery to West Louisville, where there's less access to activities than in other parts of the city, said event coordinator Bennett Knox."}
