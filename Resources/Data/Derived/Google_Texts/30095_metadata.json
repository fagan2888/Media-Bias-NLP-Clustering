Senator Bernie Sanders wants to create a single-payer system that would essentially expand Medicare to cover people of all ages.\n\nPhoto\n\nSenator Sanders\u2019s bold call for \u201ca fundamental transformation of the American health care system\u201d would look more like the plans in many other industrialized nations that often achieve better health outcomes at lower costs. His home state of Vermont flirted with the idea, but it dropped its plans because of fears that the high costs would harm the economy. A national program could be more cost-effective, but it has no chance of surmounting opposition from Republicans and from health care industries that fear their profits would be cut.\n\nMrs. Clinton vigorously defends the Affordable Care Act and its reliance on private insurance, but she would make important changes to protect people from co-payments and deductibles that have been rising faster than their wages. She would create a new tax credit of up to $5,000 to help families pay high out-of-pocket medical costs and would require insurers to cover three visits to the doctor each year before people start paying to meet their deductible.\n\nBoth Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders have taken strong stands against the sometimes exorbitant prices for prescription drugs that manufacturers set with no reasonable justification. Both would authorize Medicare to negotiate with drug companies to drive down prices \u2014 a move now prohibited by law, at Republican insistence \u2014 and both would allow Americans to import cheaper drugs from other countries. Mrs. Clinton would cap a patient\u2019s out-of-pocket drug spending at $250 a month.\n\nSign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, The Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.\n\nThe leading Republican candidates are unanimous in calling for repeal of the health care reform law \u2014 Donald Trump has called it a \u201ccatastrophe,\u201d and Jeb Bush labeled it a \u201cmonstrosity.\u201d Yet they are remarkably tongue-tied on how they would replace it.\n\nIn the Sept. 16 debate among 11 Republican candidates, the issue came up only obliquely. None of the Republican candidates have endorsed government negotiations with drug companies; they believe private negotiations and competition among drug companies are working just fine to curb drug costs.\n\nOf the Republicans, only Senator Marco Rubio has sketched out an alternative to the current health system. He would rely on tax credits of unspecified amounts to help people buy private insurance \u2014 an approach that is comparable to what the Affordable Care Act does now but that would most likely be less generous. He needs to flesh out his plans and his competitors need to devise serious alternatives of their own so that voters can see how they compare with a reform law that is working remarkably well.",
