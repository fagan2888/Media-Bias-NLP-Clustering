He turns to an aide seated to his left and half-jokes, \u201cI think you guys were ready to knock my head off by the end of it.\u201d\n\nPoilievre joined the cabinet last July, but his real debut as a minister was last week, when he brought a government bill to the floor of the House of Commons\u2014a multi-faceted reworking of federal election law and the affairs of Elections Canada.\n\nNot that Poilievre needed much introduction. Four months short of his 35th birthday, he has already been an MP for nearly a decade and, as a parliamentary secretary, he became one of question period\u2019s most prominent recurring characters\u2014a boyish, smooth-talking government defender deployed to obfuscate and irritate the opposition in response to accusations of wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cMy life is politics, reading books and exercise,\u201d he said in an earlier interview. He has said that reading Milton Friedman\u2019s Capitalism and Freedom at the age of 17 was \u201cseminal\u201d to his political thinking, and he identifies the principles of limited government and \u201cmaximizing people\u2019s freedom to work hard and achieve things for themselves and their families\u201d as the reasons he is in politics.\n\nIn preparing to table his bill, Poilievre consulted with veteran ministers John Baird and Jason Kenney, and it was Kenney\u2019s advice that seems to have guided Poilievre\u2019s public approach. \u201cHis formula for responding in the House is always to deliver a multitude of simply presented, irrefutable, documented facts,\u201d Poilievre says of the employment minister. Poilievre\u2019s responses in the House have subsequently been punctuated with references to turnout data, error rates, studies and legislation, most of it delivered confidently and quickly. To fend off one question from the NDP, he recited chapter and verse from the Director of Public Prosecutions Act. (It was a recitation that delighted the Conservative side: Maxime Bernier, Polievre\u2019s seatmate, stood to mime a home-run swing when Poilievre had finished.)\n\nResponding to Poilievre\u2019s initial remarks in the House on the new bill, NDP critic Craig Scott complimented the minister on an \u201can extremely well-prepared speech,\u201d though, via email, he still quibbles with how that knowledge has been applied, accusing a \u201csmart minister\u201d of \u201cmanipulative spin?.?.?. inaccuracy, sophistry and, ultimately, Orwellian doublespeak.\u201d\n\nThe bill is being challenged on a number of fronts, and the debate is not nearly over, so it remains to be seen how much Scott and other critics can succeed in unravelling the minister\u2019s arguments. (He has at least conceded that the bill might be amended to mollify some concerns of the chief electoral officer.) The biggest problems governments have with legislation, Poilievre says, is when \u201cthey can\u2019t answer basic questions about controversial measures. So much of the time, in politics, we try to come up with these clever turns of phrase, slogans or messages, but what the public really wants is just the simple facts,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd whichever side has a better mastery of those facts, I think, wins the debate in the long run.\u201d\n\nA fascinating battle between a rookie minister and the opposition over a potentially profound piece of legislation is thus set up.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rookie minister steels himself for battle over a potentially profound piece of legislation", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "Macleans.ca", "description": "Rookie minister steels himself for battle over a potentially profound piece of legislation", "title": "Pierre Poilievre, the reformer - Macleans.ca", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/MAC07_POLIEVRE01-300.jpeg", "url": "http://www.macleans.ca/politics/pierre-poilievre-the-reformer/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Macleans.ca", "description": "Rookie minister steels himself for battle over a potentially profound piece of legislation", "creator": "@aaronwherry", "image": {"src": "http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/MAC07_POLIEVRE01-300.jpeg"}, "title": "Pierre Poilievre, the reformer - Macleans.ca", "card": "summary"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "article": {"section": "Aaron Wherry", "tag": "pierre poilievre", "published_time": "2014-02-15T13:29:51+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb73f\"", "article_summary": "The biggest problems governments have with legislation, Poilievre says, is when \u201cthey can\u2019t answer basic questions about controversial measures.\nIn preparing to table his bill, Poilievre consulted with veteran ministers John Baird and Jason Kenney, and it was Kenney\u2019s advice that seems to have guided Poilievre\u2019s public approach.\n\u201cHis formula for responding in the House is always to deliver a multitude of simply presented, irrefutable, documented facts,\u201d Poilievre says of the employment minister.\n(It was a recitation that delighted the Conservative side: Maxime Bernier, Polievre\u2019s seatmate, stood to mime a home-run swing when Poilievre had finished.)\nTo fend off one question from the NDP, he recited chapter and verse from the Director of Public Prosecutions Act."}
