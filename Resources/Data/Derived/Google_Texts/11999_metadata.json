Hospitals and prisons and restaurants all scrambled to cope with the situation. I spoke with lake expert from the Ohio Sea Grant at the time of the crisis. \"So the conditions were such this past Friday that the bloom was really blown right down against the city of Toledo and that was sucked into the water treatment plant,\" he said.\n\nThe two day crisis garnered national\u2014even international\u2014attention. I called Reutter up recently to see what, if any, progress has been made in the wake of the bloom. He said the situation is not good but there's reason to be optimistic. \"We\u2019re seeing a real change in attitude on the part of the agricultural community. But we have to see more evidence that changes in the lake are occurring,\" he said.\n\nReducing nutrient runoff from farm fields that drain into Erie\u2019s shallow western basin is key to stopping the blooms, says Reutter.\n\nOhio House bill 490 aimed to help address the root cause of these algal blooms through mechanisms such as a ban on manure application to frozen farmland, but that bill is dead in the water.\n\nOn the national front, the Environmental Protection Agency announced it will develop drinking water health advisories for toxic algae by spring of next year (2015), and, at least for next year, the state will continue to get money from the federal Great Lakes Restoration Initiative to help ease the blooms.\n\nBut those hoping the Toledo crisis might act as a catalyst for big change, may ring in the new year with some disappointment.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It\u2019s the end of the year and ideastream is looking back on big stories from 2014, and one undeniably big story was the Toledo water crisis, which left nearly half-million people without safe drinking water.
