Gilbert; George Orwell; Lenny Bruce; Dick Gregory; Tom Lehrer, David Frost, and That Was the Week That Was; George Carlin; Spitting Image, Yes, Minister; the Smothers Brothers; the early Saturday Night Live, Dave Barry, The Onion, South Park, Family Guy, and so many more. Unfortunately, while it would be a slight exaggeration to say that political satire is dead in America, it\u2019s been on the critical list for some time. That\u2019s too bad. We need it more than ever.\n\nThroughout history, satirists have risked their liberty and even their lives using humor to engage in deep commentary about the reigning political system and its exalted political figures\u2014they\u2019re called leaders, though surely better terms are rulers and misleaders. But no satirist risks his life or liberty in America today, which makes the scarcity of good satire so puzzling. Is it fear that keeps it safely limited? Or is it simply that so few people today can see the fundamental flaws in the American political system, which trashes liberty in so many ways?\n\nYou tell me.\n\nBy now most people who pay attention to these things know that The Daily Show\u2019s host, Jon Stewart, who is probably regarded as America\u2019s premier political satirist, felt it necessary to recant after apparently uttering a heresy according to America\u2019s civic religion: democracy.\n\nIn an election-day interview on CNN, Christiane Amanpour asked Stewart if he had voted. He said, \u201cNo\u201d\u2014to which Amanpour reacted with (or perhaps feigned) amazement, \u201cNo?!\u201d\n\nStewart continued, \u201cI just moved. I don\u2019t even know where my thing is now.\u201d\n\nThat night on his own show, Stewart, after assuring his audience that he has known where \u201chis thing\u201d is since age 13, acknowledged that his answer created \u201ca bit of a story.\u201d So he felt compelled to say,\n\nTo set the record straight, I did vote today.\u2026 I was being flip, and it kind of took off. I shouldn\u2019t have been flip about that.\u2026 It sent a message that I didn\u2019t think voting was important or that I didn\u2019t think it was a big issue. And I do, and I did vote. I was being flip, and I shouldn\u2019t have done that. That was stupid. So, I apologize.\n\nWhere to begin?\n\nFirst off, how did his flip answer create \u201ca bit of a story\u201d? He\u2019s a comedian for heaven\u2019s sake! Several nights a week he makes fun of politicians and government bungling! He does flip for a living! Who got upset with his reply, aside from U.S. Secretary of War Amanpour? Whether one believed Stewart\u2019s answer or not, how in the world was it the stuff of public controversy? Does no one have a sense of humor? Must he say \u201cjust kidding\u201d after every sentence?\n\nMaybe one reason political satire is so scarce is that Americans don\u2019t get it. Paul Fussell, who wrote excellent books on how war degrades culture, said that World War II killed Americans\u2019 sense of irony. (See his Wartime.) We have here good evidence for Fussell\u2019s claim.\n\nBut even allowing for the irony-impairment of American culture, did Stewart really feel he had to apologize? Did he think he\u2019d lose his audience if he became known as one who is \u201cflip\u201d about the holy rite of voting? I realize that ratings are a matter of life and death, but come on. I doubt that his career was in jeopardy. He might have even picked up a few viewers.\n\nMy son, Ben Richman, a fine rock guitarist who also has a keen eye for politics, had a different take on Facebook:\n\nI don\u2019t think he was giving into public pressure, either. I think he genuinely felt that joking about it was wrong. At the end of the day, Stewart loves the system.\n\nI\u2019m inclined to agree. After all, he favors mandatory national \u201cservice\u201d:\n\nThere should be a draft where every young person has to do one year of something \u2014 military, public works \u2014 something so that we all feel invested in the same game, because that\u2019s the part that we\u2019ve lost. [Emphasis added.]\n\nStewart can be funny when he pokes fun at politicians for their gaffes and indiscretions, and occasionally he ventures into a minefield. (He\u2019s done some surprisingly good stuff on Israel.) But if you watch closely, you\u2019ll see that he doesn\u2019t plunge the dagger in too deep. He is a man of the system, a progressive, of course. Thus, he believes government is good, the more active the better. He rarely gets down to fundamentals, and on the rare occasion when he does, he quickly retreats.\n\nRemember when in 2009 he called President Harry Truman a \u201cwar criminal\u201d for the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which killed or maimed nearly 200,000 Japanese civilians? Now, actually that statement was neither satirical nor ironic. It was the unvarnished truth. Truman\u2019s victims threatened no one, and the war was essentially over. Yet those civilians were subjected to the most ghastly of fates. Some were vaporized on the spot, literally leaving only their shadows behind. And don\u2019t forget that Truman dropped the second bomb three days later. He considered dropping a third, but decided he didn\u2019t want to kill any more children. Reading about what the victims\u2019 experienced will turn your stomach, if you have a scintilla of decency in you.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "He's no George Carlin.", "title": "The Political Sterility of Jon Stewart", "url": "http://reason.com/archives/2014/11/09/the-political-sterility-of-jon-stewart", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14155057903820.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14155057903820.jpg", "title": "The Political Sterility of Jon Stewart", "description": "Political satire has a long and honorable history: Aristophanes,\nWilliam Shakespeare, Jonathan Swift; W.S.
