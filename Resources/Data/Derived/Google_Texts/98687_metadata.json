Approximately one in five people who are discharged from a hospital to a skilled nursing facility (SNF) are readmitted within 30 days. Although hospitalizations are often required for medical reasons, experts suggest that 28 to 40 percent of these admissions could be avoided with enhanced care in the SNF. Avoiding these admissions would reduce hospital complications which are common in older people, and save Medicare billions of dollars over the next several years.\n\nComponents of Interventions to Reduce Acute Care Transfers or INTERACT\u2122, a quality improvement program designed by researchers at Florida Atlantic University, were implemented in phase I of The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services\u2019 (CMS) Initiative to Reduce Avoidable Hospitalizations among Nursing Home Residents. CMS\u2019 initiative, made possible by the Affordable Care Act, is designed to affect hospitalization rates by directly changing practices at the facility level.\n\nThis initiative involves seven enhanced care and coordination providers (ECCPs) consisting of academic institutions, quality improvement organizations, a health care provider network, and a hospital association. Since 2013, these ECCPs have partnered with 144 nursing facilities in seven states (Alabama, Indiana, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, New York, and Pennsylvania) to implement strategies aimed at reducing hospitalizations and improving care for fee-for-service, and long-stay nursing facility residents whose care is funded through Medicare, Medicaid, or the Veterans Administration.\n\nPreliminary findings from the initiative show that all seven sites generally showed a decline in all-cause hospitalizations and potentially avoidable hospitalizations, with four sites showing statistically significant reductions in at least one of the hospitalization measures. During this period, all sites also generally showed reductions in Medicare expenditures relative to a comparison group, with statistically significant declines in total Medicare expenditures at two sites.\n\n\u201cIn order for skilled nursing facilities, home health agencies, and assisted living facilities to be able to manage older people better without sending them back to the hospital they need education, guidance, and tools they can use in everyday practice. And that\u2019s what INTERACT is,\u201d said Joseph G. Ouslander, M.D., chair of the Integrated Medical Science Department, senior associate dean of geriatric programs, and a professor in FAU\u2019s Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine, who designed and developed INTERACT. \u201cUsing INTERACT\u2019s standardized protocols, many residents of nursing homes experiencing an acute event can be treated without complications or the stress of a hospital transfer saving Medicare upwards of $10,000 or more.\u201d\n\nFollowing review and approvals from CMS, the ECCPs began implementing their initiatives in the partner nursing facilities in February 2013. Under CMS guidance, each ECCP designed its own interventions within the initiative, and all seven of the ECCP sites chose to use various components of FAU\u2019s INTERACT. Ouslander was involved in providing training for all of the ECCPs who directed implementation of the program in the 144 SNFs.\n\nApproximately two-thirds of nursing facility residents are enrolled in Medicaid, and most also are enrolled in Medicare. The CMS evaluation measures include a broad set of measures such as hospitalization rate, readmission rate, quality of care, patient experience, and Medicare expenditures.\n\n\u201cHospitalization is disruptive for older people and their families and puts them at greater risk for complications such as infections,\u201d said Ouslander. \u201cTrips to the hospital also increase the likelihood of reduced functioning after returning to a nursing home, home, or an assisted living facility. Beyond the potential negative physical, emotional and psychological impacts on assisted living residents, avoidable admissions also cost the Medicare program billions of dollars that could be reinvested to further improve the quality of care.\u201d\n\n- FAU -\n\nAbout INTERACT:\n\nINTERACT was first designed as a project supported by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and further tested in a project supported by the Commonwealth Fund under Dr. Joseph Ouslander\u2019s leadership. The program was initially implemented at 25 community-based nursing homes in Florida, Massachusetts and New York over a six-month period and resulted in a 17 percent reduction in hospital admissions among the residents. The reduction was even greater in homes that were most engaged in implementing the INTERACT intervention. The tools target three key strategies to reduce potentially avoidable hospitalizations: preventing conditions from becoming severe enough to require acute hospital care; managing selected acute conditions in the nursing home; and improving advance care planning for residents among whom a palliative or comfort care plan, rather than acute hospitalization, may be appropriate. Using INTERACT\u2019s standardized protocol and working with an on-call nurse practitioner who visits the nursing home daily, the patient can be treated in the nursing home without any complications and only costing Medicare about $200 instead of $10,000 or more. Using such care in nursing homes nationwide could improve care, reduce complications from hospitalizations, and avoid hundreds of millions of dollars in Medicare expenditures annually.

Today, the University, with an annual economic impact of $6.3 billion, serves more than 30,000 undergraduate and graduate students at sites throughout its six-county service region in southeast Florida. FAU\u2019s world-class teaching and research faculty serves students through 10 colleges: the Dorothy F. Schmidt College of Arts and Letters, the College of Business, the College for Design and Social Inquiry, the College of Education, the College of Engineering and Computer Science, the Graduate College, the Harriet L. Wilkes Honors College, the Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine, the Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing and the Charles E. Schmidt College of Science. FAU is ranked as a High Research Activity institution by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching. The University is placing special focus on the rapid development of critical areas that form the basis of its strategic plan: Healthy aging, biotech, coastal and marine issues, neuroscience, regenerative medicine, informatics, lifespan and the environment. These areas provide opportunities for faculty and students to build upon FAU\u2019s existing strengths in research and scholarship.
