Tom Corbett (R-PA) proposed an alternative to Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion on Monday during a press conference at PinnacleHealth Hospital in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. The decision is a change of course after the governor initially rejected the expansion outright in February.\n\nCorbett\u2019s plan is similar to ones that have been proposed by governors in states such as Arkansas and Iowa \u2014 where conservative lawmakers have been reluctant to expand the public Medicaid entitlement \u2014 and will require a special waiver from the federal government in addition to legislative approval in Pennsylvania. His proposal also comes with a string of demands that would reform the state\u2019s existing Medicaid program, subjecting both current beneficiaries and newly-eligible Pennsylvanians under the expansion to monthly premiums and work-search requirements.\n\nA summary of the plan is available on the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania\u2019s official website. In short, Corbett wants to use federal money that would normally have been used to enroll Americans living up to 133 percent of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) in Medicaid under the health law and instead provide them with private coverage through Obamacare\u2019s statewide insurance marketplaces. If the plan is approved, it could provide health benefits to over 520,000 previously uninsured low-income Pennsylvanians.\n\nFurthermore, Corbett\u2019s plan would force all existing Medicaid beneficiaries \u2014 as well as the newly-expanded pool \u2014 to pay a monthly premium of as much as $25 for individuals and $35 for households while eliminating co-payments for primary care doctor\u2019s office visits. The premiums would start at individuals making 50 percent FPL, or just $5,745 per year, and increase on a sliding scale up to the Medicaid expansion\u2019s upper threshold of 133 percent FPL. Healthy and uninsured low-income Pennsylvanians would also have to prove that they are searching for work or in a job-training program in order to qualify for Medicaid benefits.\n\nDuring Monday\u2019s press conference, Corbett said that he would refuse any sort of Medicaid expansion unless his cost-sharing and work-search demands were met.\n\nThere is some question as to whether or not Corbett\u2019s proposed premiums for very low-income people would be approved by the Obama administration, since federal law prohibits imposing premiums on Medicaid beneficiaries who make less than 150 percent FPL.\n\nSome public health advocates are also skeptical about the possible negative consequences of Corbett\u2019s proposed reforms. \u201cI definitely think that a cost-share of this amount, which might seem low for folks who have a steady income, would definitely be a barrier for low-income individuals,\u201d said Shannon Mace Heller, a Philadelphia-based public health attorney, in an interview with ThinkProgress. \u201cAny cost-share would definitely be a deterrent on seeking medical care.\u201d\n\n\u201cI also think that [the job-seeking requirement] is going to be a barrier for individuals to get coverage,\u201d added Heller. \u201cI\u2019m not aware of any other state that has a work-search requirements just for the Medicaid benefit.\u201d\n\nCorbett is the 10th Republican governor to embrace some form of the Medicaid expansion. To date, 25 states (including Pennsylvania) and the District of Columbia are moving forward with attempts to implement Medicaid expansion, while 22 others have declined and another three remain in limbo.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Tom Corbett (R-PA) becomes the 10th GOP governor to embrace some form of Obamacare's Medicaid expansion.
