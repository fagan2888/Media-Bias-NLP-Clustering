Just this year, it experienced 240 quakes measuring 3.0 or higher in magnitude, a sharp increase, to say the least, from its 1978-2008 average of one. The other thing those states have in common? The proliferation of fracking, and of the wells used by fracking and oil drilling operations to pump their wastewater underground.\n\nIt\u2019s no coincidence: wastewater disposal wells have been linked to sudden spates of earthquakes in previously stable areas throughout the country \u2014 the same\u2019s been suspected in Oklahoma for some time now. A study published in the journal Science confirms the connection. Just four wells, researchers at Cornell University found, are responsible for at least 20 percent of earthquakes \u2014 meaning over 100 \u2014 experienced in the state between 2008 and 2013.\n\nThe Guardian reports:\n\nIn Thursday\u2019s study, researchers found a suite of wells around Oklahoma city, which collectively were pumped with nearly 5 million barrels a month of waste, caused the swarm of earthquakes. \u201cThese really big wells have the biggest impacts on the system,\u201d said Geoffrey Abers, a professor at Columbia University\u2019s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, and one of the authors of the study. The biggest of the disposal wells was pumped with up to 1.6 million barrels a month of fracking waste. \u201cThe earthquakes themselves seem to occur on small discrete faults. As the pressure builds up in the sedimentary formation that they are pumped into \u2026 They put that fault over the edge by jacking up the pore pressure.\u201d He ruled out a natural explanation for the spike in earthquakes. \u201cThis many earthquakes over and over again is not really something we have seen in a natural system,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Just four wastewater wells were responsible for over 100 quakes, a new study finds", "title": "Oklahoma\u2019s earthquake epidemic linked to fracking", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Just four wastewater wells were responsible for over 100 quakes, a new study finds", "title": "Oklahoma\u2019s earthquake epidemic linked to fracking", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/07/03/oklahomas_earthquake_epidemic_linked_to_fracking/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/shutterstock_137387276.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Just four wastewater wells were responsible for over 100 quakes, a new study finds", "title": "Oklahoma\u2019s earthquake epidemic linked to fracking", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/shutterstock_137387276.jpg", "creator": "@readingirl", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Lindsay Abrams", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Earthquakes, fracking, frackquakes, Oil Drilling, Wastewater", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbd9d\"", "article_summary": "The proliferation of fracking, and of the wells used by fracking and oil drilling operations to pump their wastewater underground.\nThe biggest of the disposal wells was pumped with up to 1.6 million barrels a month of fracking waste.\nTopics: Earthquakes, fracking, frackquakes, Oil Drilling, Wastewater, Sustainability News, NewsLike Ohio, Colorado, Texas and Kansas, Oklahoma has an earthquake problem on its hands, so much so that it\u2019s bypassed California as America\u2019s most seismically active state.\n\u201cThis many earthquakes over and over again is not really something we have seen in a natural system,\u201d he said.\nIt\u2019s no coincidence: wastewater disposal wells have been linked to sudden spates of earthquakes in previously stable areas throughout the country \u2014 the same\u2019s been suspected in Oklahoma for some time now."}
