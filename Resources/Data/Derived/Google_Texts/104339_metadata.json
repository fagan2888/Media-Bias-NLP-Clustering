(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik, File) The Associated Press\n\nBy MARTIN CRUTSINGER, AP Economics Writer\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The federal budget deficit widened in November, driven by higher spending in areas as such as Social Security, Medicare and defense.\n\nThe November deficit climbed to $64.6 billion, up 13.6 percent from a year ago, the Treasury Department reported Thursday. For the first two months of the budget year that began on Oct. 1, the deficit totaled $201.1 billion, a 12.6 percent jump from a year ago.\n\nTotal receipts are up 2.9 percent to $416 billion over the past two months compared to a year ago. Tax revenues are growing as unemployment declines. But spending grew an even larger 5.9 percent to $617.1 billion.\n\nThe latest numbers underscore the deepening impact of paying benefits to a growing number of retiring baby boomers. The report said Social Security spending expanded 4 percent, while Medicare spending increased 9 percent.\n\nSpending on Medicaid, the government health care program for low-income individuals, rose 12 percent, partly due to an expansion authorized under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nSpending on defense military programs totaled $99 billion In October and November, a 2 percent increase over the same period last year.\n\nFor the 2015 budget year that ended Sept. 30, the deficit fell to $438.9 billion, its lowest level in eight years. The Congressional Budget Office in August forecast that the deficit for 2016 will decline further to $414 billion and then rise slightly to $416 billion in 2017.\n\nAfter 2017, the CBO expects the deficits to begin rising sharply, fueled by significant growth in Social Security and health care benefits as more baby boomers retire. CBO is forecasting the deficits will top $1 trillion annually by 2025.\n\nCongress is facing a Friday deadline to reach agreement on an omnibus spending bill to avoid a government shutdown.\n\nThe broad outlines of a two-year budget deal were reached in negotiations overseen by former House Speaker John Boehner in October before he handed over his job to new Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin. But that agreement was just a blueprint with Congress now required to fill in the specifics.\n\nThe October deal did avert a looming crisis over raising the national debt. Lawmakers approved suspending the debt ceiling until March 2017, allowing borrowing to rise with no cap until that time. The national debt currently stands at $18.7 billion.\n\nThe expectation is that lawmakers will buy more time for negotiations by passing another stop-gap spending measure.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "business/articles", "keyword": "Collections: Business", "title": "US budget deficit widened in November", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The federal budget deficit widened in November, driven by higher spending in such areas as Social Security, Medicare and defense.", "title": "US government records wider $64.6 billion deficit in November", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/business/articles/2015/12/10/us-budget-deficit-widened-in-november", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/a7/9befd6f69045901196257ba356594d/media:37727911cf64426a8b8c61b44203d66aBudgetDeficit.JPEG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The federal budget deficit widened in November, driven by higher spending in such areas as Social Security, Medicare and defense.", "card": "summary", "title": "US budget deficit widened in November"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "news", "date_published": "Dec. 10, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Collections: Top News,Associated Press,Collections: Business", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The federal budget deficit widened in November, driven by higher spending in such areas as Social Security, Medicare and defense."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1e50\"", "article_summary": "(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik, File) The Associated PressBy MARTIN CRUTSINGER, AP Economics WriterWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The federal budget deficit widened in November, driven by higher spending in areas as such as Social Security, Medicare and defense.\nThe Treasury Department releases federal budget data for November, on Thursday, Dec. 10, 2015.\nFor the 2015 budget year that ended Sept. 30, the deficit fell to $438.9 billion, its lowest level in eight years.\nThe report said Social Security spending expanded 4 percent, while Medicare spending increased 9 percent.\nFor the first two months of the budget year that began on Oct. 1, the deficit totaled $201.1 billion, a 12.6 percent jump from a year ago."}
