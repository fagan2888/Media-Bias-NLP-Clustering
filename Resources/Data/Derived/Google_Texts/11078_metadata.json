Is part of that poker package that would get the President\u2019s signature, in your opinion, Mitch McConnell, repeal of the medical device tax?\n\nMM: We certainly think it\u2019s a terrible tax that\u2019s offshored a great number of American jobs to other countries. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to sign anything, frankly.\n\nHH: Oh, really?\n\nMM: No, I don\u2019t think he will. What I think he\u2019ll probably do is veto anything we send him, and put the pressure on the states to cave and turn established state exchanges in place of federal exchanges, thereby making them eligible for subsidies. I think he\u2019s going to put the heat on the governors who have, in my view, wisely decided not to go along with this new game plan, either with the Medicaid expansion or with establishing a state exchange.\n\nIn other words, McConnell admitted that Republicans in Congress are wasting their time, and your money on efforts to repeal the ACA. President Obama is never going to sign any bill that repeals any part of Obamacare, and Congressional Democrats have more than enough votes to uphold any presidential veto.\n\nMcConnell knows that any legislation that would repeal the law is dead on arrival, but he has promised to hold a vote on repealing Obamacare. In December 2014, McConnell said, \u201cWe certainly will have a vote on proceeding to a bill to repeal Obamacare\u2026 it was a very large issue in the campaign. And, the reconciliation process does present an opportunity and we\u2019re reviewing that to see what\u2019s possible through reconciliation. So, we\u2019re certainly gonna keep our commitment to the American people to make every effort we can to repeal it.\u201d\n\nMitch McConnell has promised something that he has no intentions of being able to deliver on, so Senate Republicans will waste time and money grandstanding against a health care law that is working. The whole repeal Obamacare charade is a sham, and exactly why Mitch McConnell has become the bookend to John Boehner\u2019s failed House leadership.", "article_metadata": {"description": "During a radio interview today, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell admitted that Republicans are wasting their time with trying to repeal Obamacare because President Obama will veto any bill that they pass.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Jason Easley", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "During a radio interview today, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell admitted that Republicans are wasting their time with trying to repeal Obamacare because President Obama will veto any bill that they pass.", "title": "Mitch McConnell Admits That Obama Will Veto Any Obamacare Repeal That Republicans Pass", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2015/06/05/mitch-mcconnell-admits-obama-veto-obamacare-repeal-republicans-pass.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/obama-mcconnell-1.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-06-05T13:58:58+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Editors' Picks,Featured News,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Featured News", "published_time": "2015-06-05T13:58:58+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-05T13:58:58+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The whole repeal Obamacare charade is a sham, and exactly why Mitch McConnell has become the bookend to John Boehner\u2019s failed House leadership.\nDuring a radio interview today, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell admitted that Republicans are wasting their time with trying to repeal Obamacare because President Obama will veto any bill that they pass.\nIs part of that poker package that would get the President\u2019s signature, in your opinion, Mitch McConnell, repeal of the medical device tax?\nIn December 2014, McConnell said, \u201cWe certainly will have a vote on proceeding to a bill to repeal Obamacare\u2026 it was a very large issue in the campaign.\nIn other words, McConnell admitted that Republicans in Congress are wasting their time, and your money on efforts to repeal the ACA."}
