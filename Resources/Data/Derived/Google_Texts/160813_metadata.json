Neither played last Thursday in the final preseason game. They participated in the pregame workout. However, they became ill at some point Thursday. Webster required assistance to walk out of the locker room, with a teammate explaining that the cornerback wasn\u2019t feeling well.\n\nHillman and Webster were taken to a Dallas-area hospital for treatment. They returned to Denver on Sunday, a day later than expected, because they didn\u2019t have proper ID to travel. When asked whey they didn\u2019t travel on Thursday, general manager John Elway said tersely, \u201cIt\u2019s a medical issue.\u201d\n\nThey are both backups at key positions. Hillman performed well in preseason, and is in line to get plenty of reps against the Colts on Sunday, if healthy. Montee Ball played only one series in the preseason after undergoing an appendectomy. C.J. Anderson is listed third on the depth chart followed by undrafted rookie Juwan Thompson.\n\nWebster lined up as a starting cornerback in Chris Harris\u2019 absence. Harris expects to start on Sunday, but might need to be spelled in his first game since tearing his left ACL on Jan. 12. If Webster is compromised, it could lead to additional playing time for first-round pick Bradley Roby, who finished the preseason strong after a difficult start going opposite of Demaryius Thomas in drills.\n\nReceiver Wes Welker continues his conditioning work as he recovers from his third concussion in 10 months. He has not yet been cleared for contact or Sunday\u2019s opener.\n\nOffensive lineman Ben Garland, a former Air Force star, was not present when the team began practice. He suffered a minor injury in the final preseason game.\n\nFootnotes\n\nTwo players switched numbers. Linebacker Corey Nelson, the seventh-round pick who made the final roster, will wear No. 52 and Shaquil Barrett, a practice squader, is donning No. 50.", "article_metadata": {"Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2014/09/01/ronnie-hillman-kayvon-webster-limited-practice-wes-welker-continues-progress/29122/", "site_name": "First-and-Orange", "image": "http://local.denverpost.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/denverpost.png?v=21060130", "type": "blog", "title": "Ronnie Hillman, Kayvon Webster limited in practice"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "title": "Ronnie Hillman, Kayvon Webster limited in practice; Wes Welker continues progress", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2014/09/01/ronnie-hillman-kayvon-webster-limited-practice-wes-welker-continues-progress/29122/", "image": "http://local.denverpost.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/denverpost.png?v=21060130", "creator": "@troyrenck", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "follow, all", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "C.J.
