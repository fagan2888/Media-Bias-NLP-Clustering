And the schoolteacher from Dungog, in the Hunter Valley, says she\u2019s one of the lucky ones.\n\nMany patients from NSW rural communities have to uproot their families, spend their savings on long-distance treatment or simply die earlier than they should.\n\nOur bush heartland is dying of neglect.\n\nHEAL THE BUSH: The sick state of health in the bush\n\nHEAL THE BUSH: Rural cancer patients dying early\n\nEDITORIAL: Rural health drive critical to health equality\n\nRural Australians grow the food we eat and generate $32 billion of the nation\u2019s exports.\n\nAnd yet those Australians living in the bush and on farms in remote areas die three years earlier than their city cousins do and suffer lifetimes of poor health because of cruel neglect built into our national medical-care system. Many patients from NSW rural communities have to uproot their families, spend their savings on long distance treatment or simply die earlier than they should.\n\nSome babies are born by the roadside because 70 per cent of rural maternity units have been closed. Women like Mrs Norris have their breasts and ovaries removed because it\u2019s too hard to get to the city for cancer treatment.\n\nMedical specialists don\u2019t bother working in country areas. General practitioners get better incentives to work in Cairns than in Gundagai.\n\nAnd families are driven into debt to pay the crippling costs of travelling to Sydney for live-saving care for their children.\n\nAll these problems can be fixed \u2014 and they can be fixed relatively easily.\n\nToday, The Sunday Telegraph launches a campaign asking state and federal governments to make small but significant changes.\n\nInitially we will focus on cancer treatment, maternity facilities, doctor shortages and the \u00adinadequacies of government assistance programs.\n\nRobyn opted for a mastectomy in March this year over breast conservation and radio therapy because travelling to and from Newcaslte for five days for five weeks was just too much\n\nThis week the focus is on the poor level of cancer facilities outside metropolitan hospitals and regional centres. Every cancer diagnosis is shattering \u2014 but where you live makes a real difference to your chances of survival.\n\nRural cancer patients are up to 30 per cent more likely to die than those living in the city because they can\u2019t access radiotherapy treatment needed to control their cancer.\n\nThe Sunday Telegraph has identified a number of rural towns that need a radiotherapy centre to help cut the cancer death rate in the bush.\n\nIt costs just $7 million to put in a linear accelerator to \u00addeliver the treatment and $750,000 a year to staff it \u2014 a pittance in the context of a \u00adnational health budget worth $140 billion per annum.\n\nMore than 70 per cent of country birthing units in NSW have closed down and the \u00adopportunities to attract GPs with obstetric training are rapidly diminishing.\n\nHealth experts say state and federal governments should create specialist obstetric training facilities in the bush, as well as forcing all specialist trainees to work in the bush, and qualified doctors to spend a certain period each year working in a rural town as a condition of keeping their Medicare provider number.\n\nHeal the Bush\n\nMany bush patients are forced to travel to Sydney to see a medical specialist \u2014 but the NSW government\u2019s pitiful travel subsidies are equal to \u201cwhat it costs to put your pet dog in a kennel,\u201d according to Dr Ian Roos, spokesman for CanSpeak, a cancer patient lobby group.\n\nThe government reimburses desperately ill patients just 19 cents per kilometre of travel in their private car \u2014 and pays just $43 per night for accommodation in Sydney \u2014 just enough to afford a bed in a crowded backpacker dorm.\n\nFederal incentives are \u00addesigned to encourage doctors to work in the bush \u2014 but a Sunday Telegraph investigation has found a doctor who relocates to Cairns or Townsville will get double the money on offer for a doctor who moves to Orange, Gundagai or Deniliquin.\n\nThe Coalition made a pre-election promise to help get doctors into smaller towns where they are most needed. Federal Assistant Minister for Health Fiona Nash said she lived in a rural community, so appreciated the challenges.\n\nHer spokeswoman said the differences in cancer survival outcomes were also influenced by differences in stage of presentation, lifestyle differences and varying socio-economic status.", "article_metadata": {"MobileOptimized": 320, "description": "TO ROBYN Norris the prospect of three-hour daily roadtrips to treat her breast cancer was too much to bear.", "generator": "tcog", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/heal-the-bush-we-need-action-to-fix-rural-health-in-nsw/news-story/840839793fed0180bbc730b68aafa972", "image": "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/1f2ebf96c002be698ee09dd5b4008915", "type": "article", "description": "TO ROBYN Norris the prospect of three-hour daily roadtrips to treat her breast cancer was too much to bear.", "title": "We need action to fix rural health"}, "twitter": {"site": "@dailytelegraph", "image": "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/1f2ebf96c002be698ee09dd5b4008915", "description": "TO ROBYN Norris the prospect of three-hour daily roadtrips to treat her breast cancer was too much to bear.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "We need action to fix rural health"}, "robots": "noarchive", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "vr": {"canonical": "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/link/840839793fed0180bbc730b68aafa972?domain=dailytelegraph.com.au"}, "articleid": "840839793fed0180bbc730b68aafa972", "keywords": "rural cancer, obstetric training, cancer patients, rural health, specialist trainees, rural cancer patients, rural communities, cancer treatment, radiotherapy centres, federal governments, linear accelerator, incentive schemes, patient accommodation subsidy, patient mileage subsidy, birthing centres, annual rotation, inland towns, cancer centres, breast cancer, cancer services, death rate, rural community, rural cancer centres, rural centresPATIENTSLift patient, government assistance programs, cancer patient lobby, cancer death rate, radiotherapy treatment, centresPATIENTSLift patient mileage, long-distance treatment, cancer survival outcomes, real difference, cancer facilities, ill patients, regional centres, generous incentives, national medical-care system, linear accelerators, obstetric training facilities, rural maternity units, lifestyle differences, specialist obstetric training, isolated bush centres, national health budget, radio therapy, cancer diagnosis, maternity facilities, Medical specialists, pitiful travel subsidies, patient lobby group, Health experts, rural towns, chemotherapy nurses, country areas, private car, country birthing units, metropolitan hospitals, provider number, Broken Hill, New South Wales, Australia, Sydney, Cairns, Queensland, Gundagai, Warrnambool, Victoria, Orange, Dubbo, Orange, New South Wales Hospital, By The Numbers Inc., Federal Government, Jillian Skinner, Michael Barton, Alfred, Fiona Nash, Stuart Porges, Peter Fox, Robyn Norris, Chris Milross", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-12T12:00:00.000Z", "modified_time": "2014-07-12T13:43:03.000Z"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "HEAL THE BUSH: The sick state of health in the bushHEAL THE BUSH: Rural cancer patients dying earlyEDITORIAL: Rural health drive critical to health equalityRural Australians grow the food we eat and generate $32 billion of the nation\u2019s exports.\nMany patients from NSW rural communities have to uproot their families, spend their savings on long-distance treatment or simply die earlier than they should.\nWomen like Mrs Norris have their breasts and ovaries removed because it\u2019s too hard to get to the city for cancer treatment.\nInitially we will focus on cancer treatment, maternity facilities, doctor shortages and the \u00adinadequacies of government assistance programs.\nMany patients from NSW rural communities have to uproot their families, spend their savings on long distance treatment or simply die earlier than they should."}
