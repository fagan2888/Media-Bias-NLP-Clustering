Beatles albums have been discarded before, but mostly by crazies and Klansmen back in early March \u201966, when dubiously contextualized quotes from John claimed that \u201cChristianity will vanish and shrink\u2026\u201d and that \u201cWe\u2019re (The Beatles) more popular than Jesus now.\u201d That was 49 years ago, three years before I was born.\n\nOn Friday, I turned 46. And instead of taking some kind of inventory (I\u2019m saving that for 50), I began to think about my relationship with the Beatles, who were still together when I was born (take that, Y and Z Generations!). And my relationship to them, unlike that with just about everyone else in my life after nearly half a century (friends, family, women, pets, the government, R.E.M.) is more or less the same: pure love. I am the human equivalent of Ringo\u2019s peace fingers, and have been since I first began playing with the LPs that my mother and father gave me to play with because I was an early-depressed child. Some of those wonderful objects had posters, and lyrics, and these four beautiful men with sparkling eyes on their covers. Others had dyed vinyl, red and blue.\n\nThey were much better than TV. John Lennon was still alive. So was George. It was Camelot in suburbia, with perfect pop music coming out of faux wood-grain speakers and later, an 8-track player made of white plastic and shaped like a diver\u2019s helmet. But that\u2019s when things began to turn. I could no longer stay on the floor in the den with the turntable; I had to gather around the weird-ass 8 track. It\u2019s like that scene in \u201c2001\u201d when the vegan apes live peacefully with the tapirs until the monolith appears and that one ape realizes he can use tools \u2014 cut to lots of dead tapirs. And war.\n\nI should say that throwing out, say, the \u201cYellow Submarine\u201d soundtrack might be one thing, but the LP that I binned was \u201cRevolver.\u201d And I did it because it was the wrong \u201cRevolver\u201d! There is a \u201cRevolver\u201d that exists in my head \u2014 the mono \u201cRevolver,\u201d the music that changed everything, even Don Draper. This wasn\u2019t it. I bought this version on eBay and soon realized it was mixed, or remixed, all wrong. George Harrison\u2019s cough at the beginning of \u201cTaxman,\u201d and the background vocals chiding \u201cUh, uh, Mr. Wilson\u2026 Uh uh, Mr. Heath,\u201d were buried in the mix.\n\nYou can remix Lou Reed or Pavement all you want and I\u2019m good, but the Beatles I am orthodox about. How did I end up with this screwy \u201cRevolver,\u201d and could there be people who actually prefer it? Should I have found one of them? Placed it back on eBay and lied about its merits in my sales description? My need to always have every Beatles album from \u201cPlease Please Me\u201d to \u201cLet It Be\u201d at my fingertips 24 hours a day no matter where I am superseded the horrible sight of that Klaus Voorman cover going into the trash with the chicken bones and the pizza boxes, but it had to happen, or I risked losing my tether to the first time I heard \u201cFor No One\u201d and \u201cTomorrow Never Knows.\u201d\n\nTo paraphrase Supertramp, which I like to do as much as possible, the question of what, exactly, is a perfect and complete personal Beatles collection runs too deep for such a simple mind. Since the start of their recording career, the LPs, and later the cassettes and other updated media, have been released by Parlophone in the U.K. and Capitol in America. Not that I realized this at 10 years old. I just bought what was on sale in hopes that I would one day have everything, and kept doing so almost reflexively as the U.K. versions became easier to acquire, which is basically akin to shoving a 10-bob note up your nose. \u201cBeatles for Sale,\u201d for example, was called \u201cBeatles \u201965\u2033 in my collection and it had \u201cShe\u2019s a Woman\u201d on it (one of Paul\u2019s grooviest early songs). There was an album called \u201cHey Jude,\u201d which was not the only way you could get \u201cHey Jude,\u201d not that I would know that before buying it. I thought it was a Beatles album I\u2019d missed, but most of those songs were already on the blue album. Did Parlophone and Capitol count on people like me to be stupid, anxious, Pavlovian?\n\nI drew certain lines. I didn\u2019t buy the interview albums, although I was tempted. There was an album called simply \u201cRock and Roll Music,\u201d which had songs from the White Album (aka \u201cThe Beatles\u201d), but I bought it because I didn\u2019t own a copy of \u201cI\u2019m Down,\u201d and as with \u201cShe\u2019s a Woman,\u201d I needed it. There was an album called \u201cLove Songs\u201d with a shit-brown cover that was easy to dismiss, but I welcomed it into my collection and pretended it was a catch, even though it for some reason considered \u201cShe\u2019s Leaving Home\u201d a love song \u2014 seriously.\n\nWhen I got my first car, I made sure I had every Beatles album on cassette, because you can\u2019t play \u201cMagical Mystery Tour\u201d on vinyl in an \u201987 Toyota Tercel as you speed down Sunrise Highway. When I went off to college, CDs had just come out. The first CD I bought was \u201cDiamond Life\u201d by Sade, and the next dozen were Beatles albums. Soon my 8-tracks and cassettes and LPs went\u2026 wherever. I got into drugs (like the Beatles did, man!) and went a bit slack in keeping everything neat and organized (it was the \u201890s). I chopped out a lot of drugs off the jewel box of \u201cRubber Soul,\u201d with that swirly lensed shot of the lads, but even as addicted as I was by the \u201890s, if you told me I had to choose between my scorched CD or, well, drugs, I would have chosen \u201cRubber Soul.\u201d I even liked \u201cRun for Your Life,\u201d which John purportedly hated, even though he wrote the fucking thing (I suppose I\u2019ve written things I\u2019ve hated, too\u2026 ).\n\nBut do enough hard drugs and cold turkey will get you on the run. You will end up selling a lot of shit so you can keep doing drugs \u2014 you don\u2019t need to be Maxwell Edison to figure that one out. I moved to Hollywood after college to try to write movies as good as \u201cCaveman\u201d and \u201cGive My Regards to Broad Street.\u201d I did more drugs. I sold my car for $500 and had nowhere to play the cassettes I managed to keep track of (\u201cRevovler!\u201d). I sold my CDs and my CD player. And the reason I knew that I was truly lost was that for the first time in a quarter of a century, if I woke up in the middle of the night and needed, actually needed for my sanity and wellness, to hear \u201cFlying\u201d or \u201cWild Honey Pie,\u201d or regular \u201cHoney Pie,\u201d I was shit out of luck. You couldn\u2019t call up a radio station and request it like you could have in the \u201870s. You couldn\u2019t ask your roommate to play it for you on his upright bass and sing it (in his Georgian accent).
