(See related graphic.)\n\nWhile completed deals for the first six months of the year suggested that 2015 was performing essentially on par with 2014, the July data drags the year-to-date numbers down. With seven months of data tallied, 2015 has delivered only 1,321 completed transactions valued at $164.2 billion, compared with 1,364 completed transactions valued at $184.2 billion in the first seven months of 2014.\n\nWhile it may be tempting to blame the deceleration on summer vacations, it\u2019s important to remember that July ranked as one of the strongest months for M&A in 2014.\n\nAdding more evidence that 2015 may not prove as robust for M&A as 2014, transaction pros continue to express more optimism about the next three months than the next 12 on Mergers & Acquisitions\u2019 monthly surveys. And, while early-stage deal flow grew in July, according to the Mid-Market M&A Conditions Index (MACI), a barometer created by Mergers & Acquisitions, the pace of growth was flat.\n\nWhen asked why the M&A momentum may be slowing, dealmakers mention high prices for targets, stiff competition and concerns about the global economy, including Greece and China. Recent volatility in the stock markets is likely to add uncertainty to the dealmaking environment.\n\nOne of the biggest mid-market deals to close in July was Hormel Foods Corp.'s (NYSE: HRL) $775 million purchase of Applegate Farms, as better-for-you-food deals continue to flourish. Here's a list of other middle-market transactions to close in the month.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: To measure activity in the middle market, Mergers & Acquisitions looks at transactions that fulfill several requirements: Deals must have a value of roughly $1 billion or less; they must be completed (not just announced) within the timeframe designated; and they must include at least one U.S. company in the role of buyer and/or seller. Excluded from our charts are: recapitalizations; self-tenders; exchange offers; repurchases; stake purchases; and transactions with undisclosed values, buyers or sellers. Our data provider is Thomson Reuters, which updates its databases continuously.\n\nMid-Market Deals that Closed in July\n\nDate Acquirer Target Target Industry Value ($mil) 07/02/15 Investor Group Extendicare Holdings Inc Social Services 887.0 07/13/15 Hormel Foods Corp Applegate Farms LLC Food and Kindred Products 775.0 07/01/15 MAHLE GmbH Delphi Automotive-Thermal Sys Transportation Equipment 727.0 07/17/15 Solera Holdings Inc Identifix Inc Printing, Publishing, and Allied Services 619.8 07/08/15 CA Inc Rally Software Dvlp Corp Prepackaged Software 513.8 07/20/15 Summit Materials Inc Lafarge N America Inc-Davenpor Stone, Clay, Glass, and Concrete Products 450.0 07/07/15 Fosun International Ltd Meadowbrook Ins Grp Inc Insurance 433.3 07/13/15 Francisco Partners Management ClickSoftware Technologies Ltd Prepackaged Software 421.1 07/01/15 Sabre Corp Abacus International Pte Ltd Transportation and Shipping (except air) 411.0 07/13/15 Capmark Financial Group Inc Orchard Brands Corp Miscellaneous Retail Trade 410.0 07/01/15 CyrusOne Inc Cervalis Holdings LLC Business Services 400.0 07/23/15 Oceana Group Ltd Daybrook Fisheries Inc Agriculture, Forestry, and Fishing 382.3 07/22/15 Tesoro Logistics LP QEP Midstream Partners LP Electric, Gas, and Water Distribution 381.7 07/15/15 Mondelez International Inc Kinh Do Binh Duong JSC Food and Kindred Products 370.0 07/09/15 Capitol Acquisition Corp II Lindblad Expeditions Inc Transportation and Shipping (except air) 326.9 07/02/15 Amdocs Ltd Comverse Inc-BSS Business Unit Prepackaged Software 273.0 07/07/15 Team Inc Qualspec Inc Oil and Gas;
