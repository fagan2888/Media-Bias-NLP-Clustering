Ben Sunderman is a 19-year-old from Texas with Down syndrome, and he just got his first job. Sharon Sunderman, his mother, videotaped his reaction and it’s the best.

Ben can be seen reading carefully though his acceptance letter from Embassy Suites, where he applied for an internship. His voice is even throughout the video before he gets to the end and his mother asks him what it all means. He breaks into a huge smile, shouting, “I get it! I get a job!”

Sharon told ABC News Ben applied for the job through Project Search, a program devoted to training children with disabilities to transition from high school to entry-level positions in the work force. Though individuals with Down syndrome experience cognitive delays, the National Down Syndrome Society (NDSS) says “the effect is usually mild to moderate and is not indicative of the many strengths and talents that each individual possesses.”

The NDSS added that with quality programs, a stimulating home environment, great health care, and a supportive community — including friends and family — individuals with Down syndrome can go on to develop their full potential and lead fulfilling lives.

"Adults with disabilities can really add value," Sharon said. "Just the joy that Ben has at the fact that he is able to get a job and be part of the community. That's what every parent wants for their kid."

Sharon encourages other parents who have children with disabilities to set their expectations high. She’s always encouraged Ben to do everything he wanted, including laundry and making the bed like his brother and sister. Last year, he was voted prom king and now, he'll have a new job.
