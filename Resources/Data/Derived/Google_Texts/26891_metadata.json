But since he took over, the system has grown to include 16 hospitals.\n\n\"So it was not in a steady state coming into the organization,\" he said.\n\nHis position also includes three roles: In addition to serving as the head of St. Luke's Health System, he also is the regional marked-based officer in Texas and senior vice president of operations for CHI in Denver, where he spends a third of his time.", "article_metadata": {"description": "CHICAGO -- The\u00a0high rate of CEO turnover\u00a0creates new opportunities for hospital and health system senior executives--but also potential pitfalls.
