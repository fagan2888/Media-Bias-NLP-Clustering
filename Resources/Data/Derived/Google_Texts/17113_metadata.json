I don\u2019t think he\u2019s anywhere close to coming back right now.\u201d\n\nMcGee was back with the team on Sunday after taking a couple of days off to get his left leg examined by a doctor. He has played in just one game since Nov. 23.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that he hasn\u2019t been able to consistently be out there on the floor for us,\u201d Shaw said. \u201cFrom what I understand the area that he had the surgery on \u2013 the stress fracture \u2013 is fine. I think the muscle around that area, he\u2019s done some damage to. So that\u2019s what\u2019s been very painful; it\u2019s been hot. So that has to calm down. So I think he\u2019s going to have to miss a significant amount of time for that to calm down.\u201d\n\nMcGee, who missed 77 games last season due to the stress fracture, is averaging 5.4 points, 3.0 rebounds and 1.1 blocks in 14 appearances this season.\n\nChristopher Dempsey: cdempsey@denverpost.com or twitter.com/dempseypost", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "JaVale McGee to miss extended time with leg injury", "title": "JaVale McGee to miss extended time with leg injury", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/12/14/javale-mcgee-to-miss-extended-time-with-leg-injury/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141022__javale-mcgeep1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141022__javale-mcgeep1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-14T17:22:26+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T06:19:23+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca462\"", "article_summary": "\u201cFrom what I understand the area that he had the surgery on \u2013 the stress fracture \u2013 is fine.\nI don\u2019t think he\u2019s anywhere close to coming back right now.\u201dMcGee was back with the team on Sunday after taking a couple of days off to get his left leg examined by a doctor.\nGametracker: San Antonio Spurs vs. Denver Nuggets\u201cI heard six weeks at one point,\u201d Shaw said.\nJaVale McGee\u2019s long injury saga has taken yet another negative turn.\nI think the muscle around that area, he\u2019s done some damage to."}
