This year, those three \u2014 Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey, AmeriHealth New Jersey and Health Republic Insurance of New Jersey \u2014 were joined by two more competitors: UnitedHealthcare and Oscar Insurance.\n\nAlthough open enrollment for 2015 officially ended Sunday, the federal government has extended the deadline until next Sunday for those who tried to enroll on time but couldn\u2019t complete the application either because of a temporary technical glitch or delays caused by heavy last-minute volume.\n\nSo while the final tally won\u2019t be in for at least a week, insurers are encouraged by what they\u2019ve seen so far.\n\nLast year, Horizon and AmeriHealth, both well-known insurance brands, signed up the majority of New Jerseyans. Finishing third last year was Health Republic, a new, co-op insurance company whose startup was funded by the ACA. Because Health Republic had just launched in 2014, it had to build its brand from scratch in the New Jersey market.\n\nAll three said that, in 2015, they are building upon their first-year 2014 success.\n\nHorizon\u2019s 2015 enrollment \u201chas been robust; we have outpaced our gains from 2014, and expect a strong finish as final applications are submitted,\u201d Tom Vincz, Horizon spokesman, told NJBIZ. \u201cBased on our preliminary review of results, we expect to grow our position as New Jersey\u2019s No. 1 insurer for the individual market. We\u2019re pleased that consumers responded and chose Horizon for their coverage needs, including tens of thousands of new members.\u201d\n\nAmeriHealth NJ spokeswoman Jill Roman said: \u201cWe will have a true sense of membership in a few weeks. What I can tell you is that we are pleased with the volume of individuals we have seen purchase our plans. We believe this is the result of our successful renewal campaign, which included grassroots community outreach as well as proactive communications via mail and telephone.\u201d\n\nRoman said the company\u2019s incoming consumer call center handled approximately 57,000 phone calls between the start of open enrollment last Nov. 15 and Sunday, Feb. 15. In addition, she said AmeriHealth proactively made 97,000 calls to members to assist in explaining the renewal process and what options are available in 2015.\n\nJames Martin, chief executive of Health Republic, said the startup insurer is seeing significant gains in enrollment this year. For 2014, the new company enrolled about 4,500 New Jersey members. Health Republic said as of last Friday, two days before the official end of open enrollment, it had signed up about 55,000 New Jerseyans. That number could grow as more people sign up this week, during the special extension granted by the federal government.\n\nThe turnaround, Martin said, reflected the fact that Health Republic responded to the competition and to the feedback it got from customers, and made significant changes to its products for 2015.\n\n\u201cWe retooled and went to the market with some plans that apparently people found quite attractive,\u201d Martin said \u201cThings are going well and we are now exceeding our business plan for Year Two.\u201d\n\nHealth Republic\u2019s insurance plans were generally more expensive than the competition in 2014, so in 2015 the company reduced premiums overall between 10 and 15 percent.\n\nMartin said the company found out customers didn\u2019t want to have to get a primary doctor\u2019s referral before seeing a specialist, so Health Republic eliminated that requirement from most of its plans. And while Health Republic has a very large network of New Jersey hospitals and doctors \u2014 the company uses the extensive QualCare network \u2014 Martin said customers want to be able to use doctors in New York and Pennsylvania, and the company is offering that option this year.\n\nHealth Republic has 21 plans this year, up from 9 in 2014. One new plan is a lower-cost, innovative plan that encourages members to use \u201cpatient-centered\u201d medical practices where patient care is coordinated by primary care physicians. And in Monmouth County, Health Republic is offering a less costly plan for members who use CentraState Medical Center and its network of Monmouth County physicians.\n\nMartin said the company\u2019s experience shows that competition has a beneficial impact on the health insurance market:\n\n\u201cClearly, competition causes you to measure and compare your plans and products to what else is out there, and then you have to get into the pricing competition. Where are you compared to where your competitors are and where should you be? What does your strategy look like for the future? As in any industry, comparing (your products) with what is going on with your competitors is absolutely essential \u2014 and it has a bearing on the market.\u201d\n\nAmeriHealth\u2019s Roman said that, in 2015, the company\u2019s Tier 1 Advantage Plan, which provides enhanced cost benefits, remains its top-selling product. Roman said the AmeriHealth Community Advantage Plans, originally co-branded with Cooper University Health Care, remain among the company\u2019s Top Five selling plans. \u201cTo date, we have seen 32 percent growth over the membership in these plans from 2014. We believe this growth was driven by the plans\u2019 expansion into two additional metallic tiers and the addition of Cape Regional Medical Center and Shore Medical Center, which expanded availability from three counties to five in South Jersey.\u201d\n\nBoth UnitedHealthcare and Oscar said they will report on their enrollment experience in New Jersey after the extended open enrollment period ends on Sunday.\n\nAlthough open enrollment ended Feb. 15, anyone who was in line but couldn\u2019t enroll by that deadline has until this Sunday at midnight to sign up. Since 2014, the ACA has required most American to either get health insurance or pay a penalty \u2014 and individuals who are uninsured are finding out what their penalties will cost them as they file their tax returns by the April 15 deadline.\n\nTo help those facing penalties, the federal government is now considering reopening health plan enrollment at HealthCare.gov for a brief period during tax time this spring.\n\nU.S. Health and Human Services Region II Regional Director Jackie Cornell-Bechelli told reporters during a conference call Wednesday that HHS is \u201cConsidering a special enrollment period during tax filing time\u201d which she said would enable people to enroll in coverage for 2015, and avoid paying a 2015 penalty when they file their taxes in 2016.\n\n\u201cThat is something that we are considering, but we don\u2019t have a firm yes or no or what that window will look like,\u201d she said.\n\nU.S. Rep. Frank Pallone (D-Long Branch) said during the conference call that he is urging HHS Secretary Burwell to create a window for Americans to enroll in health coverage during tax time to avoid the penalty next year.\n\nPallone said the 11.4 million who enrolled nationwide through Feb. 15 exceeded the Obama administration estimates of between 10 million and 11 million for this year.\n\nAnd he said the New Jersey numbers also exceeded expectations: \u201cThis is a fantastic result, to have a quarter million New Jerseyans enrolled. I can\u2019t stress enough how important this is. If people don\u2019t have health insurance and they end up paying for medical care out of pocket, the consequence for their budget and their family is overwhelming.\u201d\n\nState Sen. Nia Gill (D-Montclair) told reporters during the conference call: \u201cThe message that was delivered, that health insurance is just a phone call or click away, really took root and demonstrated what we all knew, that access to health insurance is something that not only do we need but people want it and they will seek it out. With our federal partners and the people on the ground, we did not in New Jersey let any obstacle stand in our way. We worked through any obstacle to reach the people and our partners are to be applauded.\u201d\n\nALSO ON NJBIZ:\n\nExclusive: Wells Fargo names Larisa Perry region president for New Jersey, New York and Connecticut\n\nVelez to step down as Department of Human Services commissioner\n\nDrugmaker's expansion could bring 300 new jobs to East Windsor", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.njbiz.com/article/20150218/NJBIZ01/150219816/updated-new-jerseys-obamacare-insurers-feel-good-about-this-years-demand", "site_name": "NJBIZ", "image": "http://www.njbiz.com/storyimage/NJ/20150218/NJBIZ01/150219816/AR/0/AR-150219816.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Updated: New Jersey's Obamacare insurers feel good about this year's demand | NJBIZ"}, "twitter": {"domain": "njbiz.com", "title": "Updated: New Jersey's Obamacare insurers feel good about this year's demand | NJBIZ", "image": {"src": "http://www.njbiz.com/storyimage/NJ/20150218/NJBIZ01/150219816/AR/0/AR-150219816.jpg"}, "creator": "@bethfitzgerald8", "site": "@njbiz", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce123\"", "article_summary": "(This story was updated at 3:10 p.m. with more information on the federal government extending open enrollment.)\nLast year, three insurers competed to enroll New Jerseyans, most of whom qualified for federal subsidies to defray the cost of health insurance.\nFinishing third last year was Health Republic, a new, co-op insurance company whose startup was funded by the ACA.\nBecause Health Republic had just launched in 2014, it had to build its brand from scratch in the New Jersey market.\nJames Martin, chief executive of Health Republic, said the startup insurer is seeing significant gains in enrollment this year."}
