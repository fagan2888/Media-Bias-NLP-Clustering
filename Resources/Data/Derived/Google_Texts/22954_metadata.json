That's despite the fact that some applications included obvious signs of fraud. The Government Accountability Office sent 10 auditors with fictitious enrollment information to the federal healthcare.gov site as well as two state-run ObamaCare exchanges, to sign up for subsidized insurance. While eight didn't make it through the initial identity-checking process, all 10 eventually obtained coverage, even though four obviously had made up Social Security numbers that started with \"000.\" They all were able to keep their coverage despite filing fake follow-up documentation. In addition, the GAO tried to sign eight more up for Medicaid coverage. Three made it through the process, and four ended up getting subsidized private coverage instead. The only one that failed was in California, which refused to sign the person up without a Social Security number.\n\nThis whole thing has been a malevolent joke from the jump, a Cloward-Piven kluge of epic proportions designed to destroy the previously existing system and replace it with... chaos. President Corky Laputa is doing his job well. As the indispensable Betsy McCaughey noted recently in the New York Post:\n\nObamaCare is heading toward a death spiral. The Obama administration is having trouble selling insurance plans to healthy people. That\u2019s a big problem: When the young and healthy don\u2019t enroll, premiums have to be hiked to cover the costs of older, sicker people, discouraging even more young people from signing up. Last Thursday, the administration predicted enrollment for 2016 will be less than half what the Congressional Budget Office predicted in March. Despite subsidies to help with premiums and out-of-pocket costs, most of the uninsured who are eligible for ObamaCare are saying \u201cno thanks.\u201d Only one in seven is expected to sign up. That\u2019s despite a hefty increase in the financial penalty next year for not having insurance. The president sees the writing on the wall. You won\u2019t be seeing the customary nationwide TV campaign to encourage sign-ups, as there were in previous years. Remember the young guy in plaid pajamas \u2014 \u201cPajama Boy,\u201d to conservatives \u2014 well, he won\u2019t be back this winter. Bad enough that healthy people aren\u2019t buying. Worse is that the administration is spending billions of your tax dollars covering up the problem, paying insurers to keep offering the plans, even though they\u2019re losing their shirts. But facts are facts \u2014 and there\u2019s no hiding these... With ObamaCare enrollment floundering and losses mounting, the nation needs alternatives. The Republicans are coalescing around a reform plan, but Democrats are doubling down. Hillary Rodham Clinton wants to burden the existing, unpopular plans with more \u201cfree\u201d goodies, and make it harder to dodge the mandate. That won\u2019t work. A real reform would cover the seriously ill \u2014 people with pre-existing conditions \u2014 in separate plans with separate pricing and subsidies to make them affordable. Just like the high-risk pools many states used to maintain. That\u2019s the lesson of the failing ObamaCare scheme.\n\nWith Obamacare, failure not only is an option -- it's the only option. Meanwhile, we're still waiting for the now-Republican Congress to repeal it... but don't hold your breath.", "article_metadata": {"page-title": "Waste, Fraud and Abuse: Thy Name is Obamacare | PJ Media", "pinterest": "nopin", "og": {"site_name": "PJ Media", "description": "With Obamacare, failure not only is an option -- it's the only option.", "title": "Waste, Fraud and Abuse: Thy Name is Obamacare", "url": "https://pjmedia.com/blog/waste-fraud-and-abuse-thy-name-is-obamacare/", "image": "https://pajamasmed.hs.llnwd.net/e1/user-content/31/files/2015/07/pelosigavel.jpg", "updated_time": 1464302190, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "With Obamacare, failure not only is an option -- it's the only option.", "title": "Waste, Fraud and Abuse: Thy Name is Obamacare", "url": "https://pjmedia.com/blog/waste-fraud-and-abuse-thy-name-is-obamacare/", "image": "https://pajamasmed.hs.llnwd.net/e1/user-content/31/files/2015/07/pelosigavel.jpg", "site": "@PJMedia_com", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Waste, Fraud and Abuse: Thy Name is Obamacare | PJ Media", "pinterestDescription": "Waste, Fraud and Abuse: Thy Name is Obamacare", "fb": {"app_id": 149848758413844}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "That's despite the fact that some applications included obvious signs of fraud.\nThey all were able to keep their coverage despite filing fake follow-up documentation.\nThe Obama administration is having trouble selling insurance plans to healthy people.\nThat\u2019s despite a hefty increase in the financial penalty next year for not having insurance.\nBut facts are facts \u2014 and there\u2019s no hiding these...
