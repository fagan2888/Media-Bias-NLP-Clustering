Now investors are expecting interest rates to rise, which has historically been bad for stocks, Ramsey said.\n\nAlso, economic numbers have been disappointing during the last four to five months, more industry groups' stocks have struggled, and the broader stock market and the economy have lost momentum, Ramsey said.\n\nSo despite the low yields cash offers, Ramsey says he is content right now to maintain his cash and short-term bond positions.\n\n\"There will be better values to be had three, six or nine months out,\" he said.\n\nIn terms of investments, he says he's considering emerging markets.\n\niShares MSCI Emerging Markets Exchange-Traded Fund (EEM, $36.29) seeks to track the investment results of an index of the same name, which contains large- and mid-capitalization emerging market equities. These shares have a 52-week trading range of $30 to $44.19.\n\nEmerging market shares are a good value right now, but Ramsey suggests taking a cautious approach and viewing them as a three- to five-year investment.\n\n\"I'm not sure about the next 12 months,\" he said. \"Even though emerging market stocks are much, much cheaper than U.S. stocks, they typically go down more during a bear market, regardless of valuations.\"\n\nRamsey says he would have argued a year ago that emerging markets were the cheapest pocket of the global equities market, but they have fared worse than the Standard & Poor's 500 index since then.\n\nEmerging market shares have had a \"nice bounce\" in the last two weeks but are still down 21% from their September 2014 peak, he said. The S&P, meanwhile, is roughly flat during the same time period, he added.\n\nRamsey said he and his colleagues are just starting to consider adding to their emerging market investment position but have not yet pulled the trigger.\n\nABOUT THIS\n\nThe Journal Sentinel focuses on one Wisconsin money manager or analyst in this weekly feature, looking at a trend that helps investment pros make their decisions.", "article_metadata": {"title": "Emerging markets can be good value now, investment officer says", "og": {"url": "http://www.jsonline.com/business/emerging-markets-can-be-good-value-now-investment-officer-says-b99600084z1-336622501.html", "image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/js-for-social-200-final.jpg", "height": 200}, "type": "article", "description": "Emerging market shares are a good value right now, but Doug Ramsey suggests taking a cautious approach and viewing them as a three- to five-year investment.", "title": "Emerging markets can be good value now, investment officer says"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/js-for-social-200-final.jpg", "description": "Emerging market shares are a good value right now, but Doug Ramsey suggests taking a cautious approach and viewing them as a three- to five-year investment.", "site": "@journalsentinel", "card": "summary", "title": "Emerging markets can be good value now, investment officer says"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"admins": "journal.sentinel.1", "app_id": 227386193957280}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-mjs-144-icon.png", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe41a9\"", "article_summary": "Emerging market shares are a good value right now, but Ramsey suggests taking a cautious approach and viewing them as a three- to five-year investment.\n\"Even though emerging market stocks are much, much cheaper than U.S. stocks, they typically go down more during a bear market, regardless of valuations.\"\nRamsey said he and his colleagues are just starting to consider adding to their emerging market investment position but have not yet pulled the trigger.\nEmerging market shares have had a \"nice bounce\" in the last two weeks but are still down 21% from their September 2014 peak, he said.\niShares MSCI Emerging Markets Exchange-Traded Fund (EEM, $36.29) seeks to track the investment results of an index of the same name, which contains large- and mid-capitalization emerging market equities."}
