PORTO ALEGRE, Brazil — First-half goals by Islam Slimani and Rafik Halliche helped Algeria to a 4-2 victory over South Korea on Sunday, leaving the African nation second in Group H with one match left to play.

Algeria led 3-0 at halftime, but withstood a stronger South Korean second half performance to claim its first World Cup win since 1982.

Slimani scored on 26 minutes and, two minutes after the restart, defender Rafik Halliche headed in a corner. Algeria made it 3-0 in the 38th when Abdelmoumene Djabou side-footed home.

South Korea started positively after the break and pulled a goal back on 48 minutes when Son Heung-min shot through the legs of Rais Mbolhi.

Yacini Brahimi then scored for Algeria before South Korean captain Koo Ja-cheol bundled home his team’s second goal.
