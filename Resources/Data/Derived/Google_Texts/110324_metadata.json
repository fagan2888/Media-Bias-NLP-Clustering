Pope Francis defended free speech but said people should show restraint. Comments from Facebook are edited for clarity and grammar:\n\nWe do have the right to insult others and their religion. Freedom of speech has no meaning if it protects only speech with which everyone agrees. The Supreme Court does not exempt insults from the First Amendment. It does exempt speech that advocates violence.\n\n\u2014 Barry Koval\n\nThe pope means that freedom of speech is a fundamental right, but that individuals have the responsibility to exercise it in a civil manner. I don't see him advocating that governments should suppress offensive speech about religions. Advocating that people have decent manners is not the same as suppressing speech.\n\n\u2014 Jennifer Lapsner\n\nThese radicals can have different opinions about what is insulting the prophet. Where does it end? I stand with freedom of religion, and freedom from religion.\n\n\u2014 Rick Phalen\n\nI agree with the pope. You can't bully or insult someone's faith without the possibility of retaliation. After the Paris attack at the newspaper, its editors insulted again by showing the prophet on its cover. Free speech, yes. Was that a smart move? Absolutely not.\n\n\u2014 Lorenzo Ferguson\n\nA cartoon is ink on paper. It's the imagination of an idiot. Killing that idiot makes you worse than he is.\n\n\u2014 Justin Darling\n\nLetter to the editor:\n\nIt is good to know that Pope Francis is against offending other religions (\"Pope on Paris: 'You cannot insult the faith of others.'\").\n\nI did not have a chance to read his entire comment, but I would hope that he is also uncomfortable about offending the Catholic religion (his and mine). We believe it contains the fullness of truth, which he, as pope, and we, as rank-and-file-Catholics, should invite all people in the world to follow.\n\nRadomysl Twardowski; Fargo, N.D.\n\nEncourage civil discourse\n\nWe asked our followers on Twitter whether free speech should be limited when it affects religion. Comments are edited for clarity and grammar:\n\nFree speech should be limited when it comes to faith. We shouldn't use it as an excuse to insult other faiths.\n\n\u2014 @SaimaGSheikh\n\nNo, limits are not necessary. But, like other free speech, be prepared to accept the consequences.\n\n\u2014 @bfielderobx\n\nEach country regulates freedom of expression; there is no single standard.\n\n\u2014 @lavriple\n\nFor more of the conversation, follow @USATOpinion or #tellusatoday on Twitter.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1BqvrYR", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "The Paris attacks prompted a debate on whether insulting a religion should be protected speech.", "og": {"site_name": "USA TODAY", "description": "The Paris attacks prompted a debate on whether insulting a religion should be protected speech.", "title": "Is insulting religions off-limits? #tellusatoday", "url": "http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/01/18/insults-religion-blasphemy-laws-tellusatoday-your-say/21970785/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Paris attacks prompted a debate on whether insulting a religion should be protected speech.", "title": "Is insulting religions off-limits? #tellusatoday", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/bf3f4522cd71a8eea813794bbb02e827152a5aaa/c=1264-0-4720-3456&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/01/18/USATODAY/USATODAY/635572065938864268-AP-Asia-Pope.jpg", "creator": "@usatoday", "site": "@usatoday", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "fb": {"app_id": 215046668549694}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Subjects/Religion", "gci-categories": "Subjects/Religion", "gci-asset-type": "story", "title": "Is insulting religions off-limits? #tellusatoday", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "opinion", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1f87ec47bf29716e81039c142da99cb6771bb51c/c=816-0-3408-3456/local/-/media/2015/01/18/USATODAY/USATODAY/635572065938864268-AP-Asia-Pope.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/fb7482e7af766f48612b1dff08623dade040f1bd/c=1264-0-4720-3456/local/-/media/2015/01/18/USATODAY/USATODAY/635572065938864268-AP-Asia-Pope.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a2f9b376213f82aed95a986faa70de7c82788ddf/c=281-0-4877-3456/local/-/media/2015/01/18/USATODAY/USATODAY/635572065938864268-AP-Asia-Pope.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/bc147b0b6f8a8b15c97d5e20b741c9ac4c0b4bfd/c=0-451-5177-3376&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2015/01/18/USATODAY/USATODAY/635572065938864268-AP-Asia-Pope.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-01-18T19:38:13.550000-05:00", "shorthed": "Is insulting religions off-limits? #tellusatoday", "articleid": 21970785, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e4e340bc9d1c48b068b4b619c252d038ac298c00/c=0-451-5177-3376/local/-/media/2015/01/18/USATODAY/USATODAY/635572065938864268-AP-Asia-Pope.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ca3b0f5eea2fe2389fb7fc6295f44f3de8bf481e/c=1290-0-3225-3456/local/-/media/2015/01/18/USATODAY/USATODAY/635572065938864268-AP-Asia-Pope.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "Pope Francis, Charlie Hebdo, Islamic radicalism, Muslim radicalism, terrorism, Paris terrorist attacks, free speech, religion, faith, Islam"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8ef9\"", "article_summary": "Pope Francis (Photo: Alessandra Tarantino, AP)The Paris attacks prompted a debate on whether insulting a religion should be protected speech.\nPope Francis defended free speech but said people should show restraint.\nBut, like other free speech, be prepared to accept the consequences.\nFree speech, yes.\n\u2014 Justin DarlingLetter to the editor:It is good to know that Pope Francis is against offending other religions (\"Pope on Paris: 'You cannot insult the faith of others.'\")."}
