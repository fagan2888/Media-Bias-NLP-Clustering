From Guantanamo to Iran, food stamps to women\u2019s rights, here are ten reasons why Tom Cotton is a dangerous dude.\n\n1. He penned an underhanded letter to the leaders of Iran that sparked the trending hashtag #47Traitors. On March 9th, Cotton and 46 of his Republican colleagues went behind President Obama\u2019s back by signing an \u201cinformative\u201d letter to Iran, saying that a nuclear deal would not last because the next president could reverse it. Secretary John Kerry, one of the lead negotiators in the talks, called the letter \u201cutterly disgusting\u201d and \u201cirresponsible.\u201d Two dozen editorial boards slammed the letter and over 200,000 people signed a petition asking the senators to be charged for violating the Logan Act, a law which forbids unauthorized citizens from negotiating with foreign governments.\n\n2. Senator Cotton said the only problem he has with Guantanamo Bay prison is that \u201cthere are too many empty beds.\u201d Ignoring waterboarding, indefinite detention, forced feeding and other torturous acts, Tom Cotton insists that the US should be \u201cproud\u201d of how it treats the \u201csavages\u201d detained in Gitmo. As far as Cotton is concerned, \u201c[the prisoners] can rot in hell. But as long as they don\u2019t do that, then they can rot in Guantanamo Bay.\u201d This is counter to the position of many other Senators and President Obama, who has promised time and time again to close the prison. There are still dozens of men held at Gitmo who have been cleared for release, but that doesn\u2019t seem to bother Senator They-Can-Rot-in-Hell.\n\n3. He has compared the negotiations of the UN Security Council (P5+1) with Iran to the \u201cappeasement of Nazi Germany.\u201dThis accusation is ridiculous. Rouhani\u2019s Iran is not Hitler\u2019s Germany. Despite Cotton\u2019s claims that \u201cthere are nothing but hardliners in Tehran,\u201d Rouhani is a reformist, someone we need to work with to defeat ISIL. And the ongoing nuclear negotiations with Iran are a far better \u2013\u2013and safer\u2013\u2013 approach than pushing Iran to the brink of war with the US (and Israel). For once, there is actually hope for a peaceful solution, something that certainly was not an option with Nazi Germany.\n\n4. He thinks the use of killer drones should be expanded. Killer drones have resulted in thousands of civilian deaths in countries we\u2019re not even at war with, like Pakistan and Yemen, and have led to an expansion of extremist groups. Senator Cotton makes the argument of many other pro-droners: that drone pilots are safer than air pilots, and casualties are reduced. Unfortunately, it\u2019s not that simple. Drone pilots still suffer the psychological trauma associated with attacks, and the \u201ccollateral damage\u201d of drone strikes means that families and children lose their lives along with the targeted terrorists. (Note: only 2% of all people killed by drone strikes have been confirmed \u201chigh-value\u201d targets.) The last thing we need is the expansion of drone warfare, Tom.\n\n5. He claims that \u201cbombing makes us safer.\u201d While in some masochistic, twisted logic that might make sense in the short term, historically speaking US military intervention has led to more extremism\u2013\u2013 as with the formation of ISIS after the invasion of Iraq \u2013\u2013and turned local populations against the United States. Ultimately, bombing other countries just fosters more hate and anti-American sentiment. Bombing might not make us safer, but it certainly makes Tom Cotton\u2019s friends in the defense industry a whole lot richer. Just 24 hours after his notorious letter to Iran became public, Cotton was the guest of honorat an event hosted by the National Defense Industrial Association, a lobbying and professional group for defense contractors.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A letter to Iran is only his latest stunt.
