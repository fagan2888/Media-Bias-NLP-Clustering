I wonder if President Obama would have attended the funeral of Justice Scalia if it were held in a Mosque? Very sad that he did not go! â€” Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 20, 2016

Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump took aim Saturday at President Barack Obama's decision to skip Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia's funeral Trump vented on Twitter, questioning whether Obama might have chosen to attend if it had been held in a mosque instead of a Roman Catholic basilica.

The White House Thursday said Vice President Joe Biden would attend the funeral instead, partly because his lighter security would be less disruptive.



Biden, like Scalia, is Roman Catholic.
