Since 2009, the state has cut funding to the hospital by nearly 50 percent.\n\nThe hospital admitted 28,753 inpatients in 2014, 90 fewer than 2013. Hospital admissions have declined nationwide because many services that used to require a hospital stay can be done on an outpatient basis, McCabe said.\n\nUpstate's emergency room was busier than ever last year. The ER cared for 96,411 patients in 2014, up from 90,268 in 2013. Upstate has seen a 28 percent increase in ER visits since 2011.\n\nMcCabe said part of the increase has occurred because more people have health insurance now under Obamacare. \"Some of it is also because we have a generation of people who want their care now instead of waiting to see their doctor tomorrow.\n\nHighlights from the hospital's financial statement:\n\nHighlights from Upstate's financial statement\n\nAdmissions:\n\n2014: 28,753\n\n2013: 28,843\n\nChange: -90\n\nOperating room cases:\n\n2014: 19,234\n\n2013: 19,161\n\nChange: 73\n\nOutpatient clinic visits:\n\n2014: 137,688\n\n2013: 121,528\n\nChange: 16,160\n\nContact James T.
