Those already participating will automatically be enrolled in the same plans as last year, unless a change is initiated online or with an insurance agent.\n\n\"For those new to Kynect, they can get on the Kynect website themselves or they can contact an agent,\" said Schardein.\n\nRandy Huff, Center of Insurance customer, suggests contacting an agent either way.\n\n\"I did try the website. I was very frustrated with it. It is nice to have somebody to go to and ask questions,\" said Randy Huff, insurance customer.\n\nHowever, rates have fluctuated for the upcoming year, which can prompt changes for many.\n\n\"There has been about a 19% rate increase with Kentucky Health Cooperative. Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield has actually had a 4.3% decrease on their plans for 2015. Humana has had a slight increase, between 10% and 13%,\" said Schardein.\n\nThe cost of not purchasing healthcare coverage remains consistent with last year's law. If your household income is more than $19,650, the fee is 1% of your income. If you make less than $19,650, the penalty can be maxed out at $285 per family, costing $95 per person.\n\nHuff says, if you're uncertain about the success in your own individual coverage, doing your homework is worth your dollar.\n\n\"I'm one of those people. I'm one of those people who thought they totally screwed up my healthcare. I remember questioning what I should do. For me, it wasn't anything bad,\" said Huff.\n\nTwo new insurance carriers have been added to the individual coverage in Kentucky, Well Care and Caresource.\n\nEnrollment is open through February 15, 2015.", "article_metadata": {"description": "With only a few days into Kynect's open enrollment, the Governor's Office says Kentucky had the second highest reduction of uninsured people in the country, for 2014.", "language": "english", "author": "Kayla Vanover", "og": {"url": "http://www.wbko.com/home/headlines/Kynects-2015-Open-Enrollment-Consists-Of-Rate-Changes-283425061.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/421*315/kynect2.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "With only a few days into Kynect's open enrollment, the Governor's Office says Kentucky had the second highest reduction of uninsured people in the country, for 2014.", "title": "Kynect's 2015 Open Enrollment Presents Rate Changes"}, "twitter": {"description": "With only a few days into Kynect's open enrollment, the Governor's Office says Kentucky had the second highest reduction of uninsured people in the country, for 2014.", "creator": "@wbkotv", "url": "http://www.wbko.com/home/headlines/Kynects-2015-Open-Enrollment-Consists-Of-Rate-Changes-283425061.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/421*315/kynect2.jpg", "title": "Kynect's 2015 Open Enrollment Presents Rate Changes", "site": "@wbkotv", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "fb": {"app_id": 127798975567, "pages": 63322919917}, "keywords": "Kynect's 2015 Open Enrollment Presents Rate Changes", "google-site-verification": "JEsUJ-apax7vWIA6vgCv7Vo4tJmOvw3rjQlzmYfV01M", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Kynects 2015 Open Enrollment Presents"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf6dd\"", "article_summary": "The nation is nearly one year into the newest health care system required under the President's Affordable Care Act.\nMore than 521,000 Kentuckians enrolled in health care coverage through Kynect for 2014.\n\"There has been about a 19% rate increase with Kentucky Health Cooperative.\n\"For those new to Kynect, they can get on the Kynect website themselves or they can contact an agent,\" said Schardein.\nJill Schardein, local insurance agent, describes her experiences with local customers."}
