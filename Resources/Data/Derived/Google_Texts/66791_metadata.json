Gunmen stormed the shopping mall in Nairobi on Saturday killing at least 20 people in what Kenya's government said could be a terrorist attack, and sending scores fleeing into shops, a cinema and onto the streets in search of safety.\n\nCredit: Reuters\n\nAl-Shabaab has promised more attacks on foreign soil following the assault on Westgate Mall in Nairobi that killed at least 62 people. \u201cAttacks like this will become common in Kenya,\u201d said a spokesman of the al-Qaeda-affiliated Somali group on Monday.\n\nThe scale of the attack has shown al-Shabaab is far from finished despite setbacks following Kenya\u2019s 2011 occupation of their Somali strongholds. It is feared that Westgate may represent the start of a major campaign.\n\n\u201cKenya has been in their crosshairs since 2011, so in a sense it is revenge,\u201d Abdullahi Boru Halakhe, security analyst for the region, told Metro. \u201cBut this also shows the internationalists are winning the internal battle in al-Shabaab. It is a coming-out statement.\u201d\n\nBoru Halakhe, who has researched the group for many years, claims they have established several training camps in Kenya and believes the country will be under serious threat around the Christmas holidays. \u201cI would not be surprised to see attacks on Kenya, Uganda, and possibly Western nations.\u201d\n\nAl-Shabaab lost public support in Somalia following the 2011 famine in which they expelled aid groups, worsening the crisis. The Somali government has been able to regain parts of the country, including the Kismayo airport that provided the group\u2019s main income.\n\n\u201cThe nature of the attack promotes their operational capabilities,\u201d said ex-FBI agent and counter-terrorism operative Ali Soufan. \u201cThe level of sophistication and publicity will attract new recruits and funding, and they have been successful in recruiting from the West.\u201d\n\nSomalia has become a sanctuary for terrorists compared to the danger they would face in Afghanistan or Pakistan, according to Soufan. \u201cThe attack shows that affiliates of al-Qaeda have become more dangerous than the group itself.\u201d\n\nThe Kenyan government has promised a forceful response with retaliation expected in the coming weeks, but a military solution may not be enough. \u201cTrying to stabilize the Somali government and deprive al-Shabaab of territory should be a key goal,\u201d said counter-terrorism expert and author Daveed Gartenstein-Ross.\n\n\u201cWe need a broad range of tactics with all the ministries coming together, and we must disrupt their funding,\u201d said Boru Halakhe.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Al-Shabaab attacks could reach the West", "author": "Kieron Monks, Metro World News", "og": {"site_name": "Metro", "description": "Al-Shabaab attacks could reach the West", "title": "Al-Shabaab attacks could reach the West", "url": "http://www.metro.us/news/al-shabaab-attacks-could-reach-the-west/tmWmiw---87vt8BzlApu46/", "image": "http://www.metro.us/_internal/gxml!0/4dntvuhh2yeo4npyb3igdet73odaolf$7la6fdygm5aknhd8okklinwd6u9kfck/2013-09-22T234756Z_2_CBRE98L1SD900_RTROPTP_4_KENYA-ATTACK_slide-614x408.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "metro.us", "description": "Al-Shabaab attacks could reach the West", "creator": "Kieron Monks, Metro World News", "image": {"src": "http://www.metro.us/_internal/gxml!0/4dntvuhh2yeo4npyb3igdet73odaolf$7la6fdygm5aknhd8okklinwd6u9kfck/2013-09-22T234756Z_2_CBRE98L1SD900_RTROPTP_4_KENYA-ATTACK_slide-614x408.jpeg"}, "title": "Al-Shabaab attacks could reach the West", "site": "@Metro_US", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "9F42CC1BA36D4325E006BBA620C3B678", "robots": "index,follow,noodp,noydir", "mediatype": "Article", "keywords": "International,Region National,Kenya,al Shabaab, anaylsis, history, Islamists, Kenya, Nairobi, terror attach, West", "fb": {"app_id": 1610587402522117, "pages": 146825895340972}, "date": "2014-10-12", "article": {"contentgroup": "Article Automatic,US Legacy Import Automatic", "section": "/news/international", "published_time": "2013-09-23T15:27:51Z", "modified_time": "2013-09-23T15:27:51Z"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "International,Region National,Kenya,al Shabaab, anaylsis, history, Islamists, Kenya, Nairobi, terror attach, West"}, "article_summary": "\u201cAttacks like this will become common in Kenya,\u201d said a spokesman of the al-Qaeda-affiliated Somali group on Monday.\nCredit: ReutersAl-Shabaab has promised more attacks on foreign soil following the assault on Westgate Mall in Nairobi that killed at least 62 people.\nThe scale of the attack has shown al-Shabaab is far from finished despite setbacks following Kenya\u2019s 2011 occupation of their Somali strongholds.\n\u201cTrying to stabilize the Somali government and deprive al-Shabaab of territory should be a key goal,\u201d said counter-terrorism expert and author Daveed Gartenstein-Ross.\n\u201cKenya has been in their crosshairs since 2011, so in a sense it is revenge,\u201d Abdullahi Boru Halakhe, security analyst for the region, told Metro."}
