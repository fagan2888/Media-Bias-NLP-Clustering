Marianna- In sworn statements by the 15 year old victim, she and 32 year old grand ridge middle school teacher Patrick Kyle McDaniel had been involved in a three month long sexual relationship.

According to the affidavit, the victim and McDaniel engaged in oral sex and digital penetration more than ten times at her parents house and/or or McDaniels house. A search of McDaniels cell phone revealed evidence of the relationship.

During his first appearance Friday morning, Honorable Wade Mercer of the 14th Judicial Circuit had this to say:

"In the complaint, the warrant is for one count, but the complaint does allege several instances of second degree felonies and possibly some third degree felonies after the young lady turns 16. And as I understand, according to the State Attorney's office... you made, I don't know if 'confession' is the right word, but incriminating statements."

The victim, now a student of Sneads High School, was once a student of McDaniels at Grand Ridge Middle School.

McDaniel is the son of Jackson County Deputy Superintendent, Cheryl McDaniel and Panhandle Area Educational Consortium's (PAEC) Executive Director, Patrick McDaniel.

"It's a sad situation on both sides of the investigation," Jackson County Major, Donnie Branch said.

According the Branch, the case was still under investigation.

McDaniel's bond was set for $75,000. He accepted a conditional release agreement to pay 10% of the bond to the Registry of the Courts and have no contact with the victim or her family.

Judge Mercer said, "no contact means no contact. I understand this is a young lady and she may initiate contact. If she does, you tell her, i cannot talk to you or i will go back to jail. If I get any reliable information that you have texted her, you have called her, you have Facebooked her, you met her at Walmart- then you will go to jail with no bond and you will stay there."

The McDaniel family and school officials declined to comment.
