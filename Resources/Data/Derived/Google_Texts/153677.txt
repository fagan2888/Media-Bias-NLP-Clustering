Letter agreeable in some ways, but not in others

After reading Garry Cooper’s letter, I agree that Homeland Security (detestable Nazi term, by the way) shouldn’t be spying on Americans. However the border will remain open as long as big business wants it to.

I agree on the delta tunnels but I think the future demands high-speed rail. I personally would like illegals to get a driver’s license as it seems safer than the alternative. I don’t think the sheriff’s deputies deserve a 5 percent raise and agree that the mentally ill and people of color are being gunned down by the police. I also think the spending on prisons is ludicrous. School spending and drug rehabilitation programs should be a priority. I do like and respect my firemen for the dangerous job that they do and think they earn every penny. Besides, it was the financially corrupt manipulation of contract bidding for a city’s projects that bankrupted cities.

I am grateful that attorneys specialize in getting SSI disability as there are so, so many people who truly deserve it. I witnessed this on the job. The Constitution is forcing the Affordable Care Act on us. It may be bad, but it is a step forward toward single-payer health care. Besides, millions of people are now insured who weren’t previously. I agree that Republicans have no functional health care program as the Affordable Care Act was taken from the Republican platform and Democrats just adopted it. The Keystone Pipeline is dangerous environmentally and will only profit Canada. The banksters certainly caused homelessness.
