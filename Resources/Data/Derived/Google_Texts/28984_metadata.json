He\u2019s an asshole, really, and a good person.\n\nWe need people like Andrew. He\u2019s the kind of mouth and muscle you need in Little Italy, New York, in December when some sour grifter attempts to fleece you for the cost of a cheap \u201cI (Heart) New York\u201d sweater. Or when a used car salesman tries to sell you a hoopty hidden under a coat of fresh paint. Yes, that\u2019s when Andrew\u2019s kind comes in handy. His tongue pierces and his eyes burn, and he knows when to turn it on. But he\u2019s also the kind to crawl into town unannounced with hardly a dollar to his name and a heart so obviously broken that all he can talk about is how good things are for him lately. Which is, of course, a lie. Yes, Andrew\u2014he\u2019s an asshole, and a good person.\n\nSo it was recently that I\u2019d received a text from the drifter, the rolling stone, late in the night as I slept lightly, listening to the clacking of naked tree branches violently snapping against one another just outside my window during a windstorm. \u201cI\u2019m in town, man,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWhere are you? Come out. Play.\u201d It was 2 a.m., so I ignored him, rolled over and listened to more branches breaking until the sun bled through the blinds.\n\n6 PM, FOLLOWING DAY: Al Sharpton goes off like a grandfather clock, booming and bellowing about 20 yards away from my desk at the other end of this studio in Rock Center. He\u2019s at it again, reeling about the bigotry and arrogance of the GOP, of Boehner and Ryan and other tea-type tarts. He cut short his didactic screed today to shamelessly pitch his latest book. I scan the newsroom to see if anyone else can mouth his scripted sermon, which has, at this point, grew so hackneyed that it\u2019s like a good song gone bad with repetition.\n\nBy 8 p.m. I\u2019d grown seriously restless. Too much ugly news coming through the wire, and far too much Sharpton. Indeed. I\u2019ll meet Andrew here soon, I thought. Kill two birds \u2013 meet him for a drink and forget all about the maniacal religious who light up shopping malls with bullets & bombs in the name of their God, or maybe I\u2019d rather expel the image of that dog, chained to a fence, left in the bitter cold. No food. No water. All the while his fat owner sits naked on a soiled recliner, ignoring the whimper coming from outside. \u2026\n\nYes, the wire was foul, and I needed to take my mind off it, at least for a night. We\u2019ll hit it again in the morning, I thought. Report the shady \u2013 it hates the light.\n\nI flung open the lounge door and found Andrew at the far end of the dim bar with two drinks and a plate of questionable food, laughing loudly like he\u2019s known to do, and with a blond woman leaning into his shoulder, grinning, twisting his hair with her finger.\n\n\u201cKhola!\u201d Andrew shouted as I approached.\n\n\u201cHey, man.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you want anything to drink? It\u2019s on me!\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s cool. I can get it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is Erica,\u201d Andrew said, gripping the lady at her waist. \u201cErica, meet Simon.\u201d\n\n\u201cHi. Andrew\u2019s been telling me about you,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all true,\u201d I quipped. \u201cEven the bad stuff.\u201d\n\n\u201cAngie was here earlier,\u201d Andrew said, shouting over the blare of the muzak. \u201cShe had a drink then left. She seemed pissed.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know why,\u201d he said, quickly glancing at Erica.\n\n\u201cAh. Yes,\u201d I said. \u201cThat.\u201d\n\nAngie, the Apache, an old friend of ours, doesn\u2019t approve of Native men dating white women, so when she showed up to the lounge that night, Andrew said, she quickly ordered a drink, banged her glass against his with a welcome-to-town, ignored Erica, used the bathroom, then boomed out the door.\n\n\u201cIt was quick,\u201d Andrew said gruffly. \u201cI had hoped she\u2019d stay longer. I just don\u2019t know what her problem is.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, you do,\u201d I said. \u201cShe\u2019s told you before,\u201d I said. \u201cBack home, in Colorado, when you showed up at the March Pow Wow with what\u2019s-her-face.\u201d\n\nAt this point, Erica, wiggy and rheumy-eyed, was having her own conversation with a couple standing directly behind her, vying for the attention of the bartender, leaving Andrew and I to chat on our own for a bit. In an instant, I saw in Andrew\u2019s black eyes that a heavy thought clicked somewhere in his skull. This is when he went off the rails into a mad rant:\n\n\u201cYou know what, Simon, the heck with her!\u201d he yelled. \u201cWho is she to judge me about who I date? About what I do? Dating Native women is fine and all, but goddamn it\u2019s incestuous! Often enough the chick\u2019s already taken, and has been since, like, high school. And shit, man, it goes the other way, too. I bet you the women say the same thing about us. Some dude they like has already dated some friend or cousin of theirs, and they say, \u2018That guy has, like, four kids,\u2019 or something.\u201d\n\nThis lovesick bastard, I thought. Somewhere someone had a grip on him. His mind was still with her, whoever she is, the heartbreaker.\n\nStill, I don\u2019t know how he came to town or on whose dime, and I sure as shit don\u2019t know how he met Erica, but Andrew\u2019s sudden arrival meant something seriously bad went down back home \u2013 something he needed to get far away from. And now here he is, in New York City, in body, but not mind, sitting at a seedy bar in the Upper West Side with a woman who\u2019s, at the moment, not paying much attention to him, loudly damning the poor dating scene in Indian country, calling for more bad bar food, drinks and then asking me if he could spend the night at my place.\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you date white women?\u201d Andrew asked.\n\n\u201cI have,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ve written about it. You know that.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you don\u2019t prefer them,\u201d he goaded.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had bad experiences with their parents, mostly,\u201d I said. \u201cMa & Pa can\u2019t handle my opposition to Thanksgiving, (Abraham) Lincoln, blind American nationalism and all that jazz.\u201d\n\n\u201cBullshit!\u201d Andrew exclaimed. \u201cYou\u2019re an ass guy! Just admit it already!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never denied that, you shithead,\u201d I said. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m a curves guy, and keep your voice down.\u201d\n\nAndrew laughed heartily and turned his attention back to an unsteady Erica, so I called for the tab, paid for my drink, told Andrew to text me if he needed a place to crash, said, \u201cGoodbye. Nice to meet you\u201d to Erica, and then headed for the 1 train.\n\nI didn\u2019t hear from Andrew that night, and still haven\u2019t. I assumed he stayed with Erica or begged Angie to let him sleep it off on her couch.\n\nOh well. Word is he\u2019s home now, fat & happy and probably with somebody new. Good for him. Salud.\n\nAnd the point of this piece is: don\u2019t judge your friend\u2019s date or preference or pals \u2013 or find yourself stuck in a newsroom-turned-studio with Al Sharpton at 6 p.m. in Midtown on a Monday night. These are all crippling things that will invariably warp your mind and chap your ass.\n\nNow, I\u2019m off to the gym. Snagging season is upon us. Cheers.\n\nSimon Moya-Smith, Oglala Lakota, has a Master of Arts degree in journalism from Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism.
