The nuances of New Jersey law, however, make the case less cut and dry than it appears. Beyond the legalities, it has many talking about the moral and ethical obligations parents have (or don\u2019t have) when it comes to paying for their children\u2019s college education.\n\nOn Wednesday, a judge threw out the first half of the suit filed by Rachel Canning, 18, in which she wanted her parents to pay for her last semester of private school and to provide child support while she\u2019s living with a friend\u2019s parents in a neighboring town. Canning claims she was kicked out of her parents\u2019 home in Lincoln Park, N.J., after her 18th birthday last November (they claim she left voluntarily) after refusing to stop seeing her boyfriend and abide by other house rules. Canning, an honor student and cheerleader at Morris Catholic High School, says she\u2019s unable to support herself financially.\n\nRelated: Why Parents Say \u2018No\u2019 to Paying for College\n\nUnder New Jersey law, children are considered emancipated at age 18 \u2013 but the presumption is rebuttable, and previous case law has required parents to continue footing their children\u2019s bills as long as the children remain under their \u201csphere of influence\u201d or are incapable of living on their own. (Severely disabled children, for example, are never emancipated.)\n\nAbout a third of states have similar laws on the books, requiring parents to provide some financial support for their children after their 18th birthday. But that law has generally always applied to divorced parents or families in which custody is otherwise an issue, such as when a grandparent has raised the child. In general, courts have been hesitant to step in where the parents remain married and are in agreement on a course of action.\n\n\u201cThis may be the first case in New Jersey \u2013 and possibly the first case in the nation \u2013 where you have an intact family and the parents are saying, \u2018I don\u2019t want to pay for college\u2019 and the judge could say \u2018You have to,\u2019\u201d says Andrew Economos, a family law attorney in Monroe Township, N.J.\n\nIn cases of divorced parents, judges will consider the parents\u2019 financial ability to pay for college expenses and require them to pay a certain amount after a student has exhausted student loans and other means of attaining college funds. Out-of-state tuition at the University of Delaware \u2013 Canning\u2019s top choice \u2013 will be about $30,000 next year.\n\nIf the Cannings are able to cover all of that, they\u2019d be doing a lot better than most families. Last year, parents paid an average of 27 percent of their children\u2019s college expenses from their income and savings, for an average of $5,700, according to Sallie Mae. That was down from a peak of 37 percent in 2010.\n\nSome argue that parents have no obligation to fund their children\u2019s college costs, and financial planners have long maintained that if paying for a child\u2019s higher education would put the parents\u2019 current or future financial health at risk (which does not appear to be the case for the Canning family), it would be irresponsible to do so.\n\nStill, more than 60 percent of young adults (ages 19 to 22) receive some financial help from their parents, with 35 percent receiving tuition assistance, according to a 2012 study from of the University of Michigan. Parents with the means to cover college expenses often believe that denying their children access to the best (and priciest) schools could hurt their career prospects in a hyper-competitive job market.\n\nIn this case, Canning\u2019s parents have reportedly already established a college fund in her name, so it\u2019s not a question of having adequate funds. \u201cNot only can her parents afford it, but the money is already sitting off to the side,\u201d says Michael Boulette, a family law attorney in Minneapolis. \u201cThe question is whether she can tap into it, when she has essentially told her parents she wants nothing to do with them.\u201d\n\nRelated: When Parents Pay for College, Kids\u2019 Grades Could Suffer\n\nSetting aside ethical and legal obligations, parents who do want to pay for their children\u2019s college education should establish the limits of such benefits early on by discussing their expectations with their child. Such agreements might allow families to avoid ending up in a similar situation to the Cannings\u2019.\n\n\u201cParents should say to the child, \u2018We have put aside money for your college education, but if we don\u2019t see you applying yourself assiduously, then we\u2019re not going to underwrite this endeavor unless we think it\u2019s a worthwhile investment,\u2019\u201d says Brad Sachs, a Columbia, Md., family psychologist and author of Emptying the Nest: Launching Your Young Adult Toward Success and Self-Reliance. \u201cThe key is framing it as an investment, rather than as an obligation.\u201d\n\nParents who bankroll their children\u2019s expenses without such discussions are doing their children a disservice, Sachs says. Such children may enter adulthood with a limited sense of how to manage finances, or be ill-equipped to make financial decisions on their own.\n\nKids with a financial stake in their own education also may fare better in school. While students whose parents pay for school are more likely to attend and graduate, their GPA is negatively impacted by how much their parents spend on college, according to a study last year in the American Sociological Review. As parental aid increases, every income group sees a reduction in GPA, with the curve steepest among the most privileged students.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The case of the New Jersey teen who is suing her parents to force them to pay her college tuition has drawn international headlines.
