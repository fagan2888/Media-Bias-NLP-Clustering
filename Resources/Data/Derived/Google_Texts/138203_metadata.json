The device's portable nature would allow for sequencing to become far more accessible, bringing the option of more personalized diagnosis and treatment to more patients.\"\n\nSamples are dropped into the device, which can be plugged into a laptop using a USB cable. DNA is read as it is unzipped while passing through nanopores in the device. The proteins in DNA cause unique changes in an ionic current, which are detected and recorded by the device. Each of these changes represents a protein in the DNA.\n\nOnce the genome has been decoded, software first detects and corrects overlaps between sequence reads, then it assembles the corrected reads, before refining it using a \"probabilistic model of the electric signals caused by DNA moving through the nanopore.\"\n\nThe method of assembly the authors devised had three stages. First, overlaps between sequence reads are detected and corrected using a multiple alignment process. Then the corrected reads are assembled using the Celera assembler and finally the assembly is refined using a probabilistic model of the electric signals caused by DNA moving through the nanopore.\n\nThe device, which can be plugged into the USB port of a laptop, is designed to allow real-time genome sequencing in doctor's offices or on-site during an emergency.\n\nResearchers said they expect over time to be able to quickly sequence larger and larger organisms genomes, including humans.\n\n\"Long reads are necessary to assemble the most repetitive parts of genomes but we need a lot of reads if we want to sequence human genomes. The small size of the MinION suggests there is room to scale up and sequence larger and more complex samples,\" said Dr. Jared Simpson, Principal Investigator at the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research.\n\nThe study is published in Nature Methods.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Researchers sequenced and assembled the full genome of the E.coli bacteria using a device the size of a cell phone.", "og": {"site_name": "UPI", "description": "Researchers sequenced and assembled the full genome of the E.coli bacteria using a device the size of a cell phone.", "title": "Palm-sized device can map full organism genomes", "url": "http://www.upi.com/Health_News/2015/06/15/Palm-sized-device-can-map-full-organism-genomes/6341434391740/", "image": "http://cdnph.upi.com/sv/ph/og/i/6341434391740/2015/1/14343950659205/v2.1/Palm-sized-device-can-map-full-organism-genomes.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/6341434391740/2015/i/14343950659205/v2.1/Palm-sized-device-can-map-full-organism-genomes.jpg?lg=4", "description": "Researchers sequenced and assembled the full genome of the E.coli bacteria using a device the size of a cell phone.", "site": "@UPI", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Palm-sized device can map full organism genomes"}, "fb": {"app_id": 130795020312660}, "keywords": "Health", "google-site-verification": "vnkcuJA1Q89cLmy4OZpuQKOf5Jf6ny_RVh7BpxZ11a0", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Health"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe3e92\"", "article_summary": "Researchers said they expect over time to be able to quickly sequence larger and larger organisms genomes, including humans.\nFirst, overlaps between sequence reads are detected and corrected using a multiple alignment process.\n\"Long reads are necessary to assemble the most repetitive parts of genomes but we need a lot of reads if we want to sequence human genomes.\nThe device, which can be plugged into the USB port of a laptop, is designed to allow real-time genome sequencing in doctor's offices or on-site during an emergency.\n\"Scaled up, this technology could one day be used to sequence tumor genomes."}
