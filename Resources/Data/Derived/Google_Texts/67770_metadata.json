Huffington Post bloggers are unanimous: \u201cunbridled\u201d austerity imposed by the Liberal government is destroying hard-won \u201centitlements\u201d acquired in the past 55 years.\n\nThere\u2019s just one problem: Quebec isn\u2019t facing austerity, but fauxsterity. As I\u2019ve previously demonstrated, there have been no spending cuts in Quebec. In fact, the latest official economic update confirms it: spending is set to increase by 1 to 2 percent annually for the next five years. Despite Treasurer Martin Coiteux\u2019s wish to cut government programs, the tendency towards fauxsterity rather than far-reaching reforms will only be reinforced thanks to Liberal tax increases. Indeed, if past trends are any indication, spending is likely to increase even higher than forecast levels.\n\nThis won\u2019t be the first time that North America has witnessed fauxsterity. In the United States, the period between 1929 and 1944 was characterized by huge spending and tax increases, alongside a devastated economy. Policy makers should hardly be surprised that economic policies favored by far-right leaders during that same era failed to bring prosperity.\n\nBut fauxsterity seems to be back in vogue. After the government-induced housing bubble burst in 2007, Presidents Bush and Obama increased spending to massive levels to \u201csave\u201d the economy they both wrecked.\n\nObamacare alone includes 20 new or increased taxes. As a result, US labor participation is at its lowest since March 1978; debt has increased by 70 percent since 2009 \u2014 its nominal amount more than doubled \u2014 employment growth is at its slowest since 1945; and most poverty indicators are going through the roof.\n\nGenuine Austerity Works\n\nIf Obama, or indeed any political leader, truly wants to help a faltering economy, he simply has to apply a libertarian\u2019s favorite French expression: laissez-faire, laissez passer. In other words, by applying genuine austerity measures \u2014 spending and tax cuts \u2014 the economy will recover in no time.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Commentators lamenting public-spending restraint should take a history lesson: real austerity benefits indebted governments and cash-strapped taxpayers.", "generator": "Give v1.4.5", "og": {"site_name": "PanAm Post", "description": "Commentators lamenting public-spending restraint should take a history lesson: real austerity benefits indebted governments and cash-strapped taxpayers.", "title": "An Austere Quebec?
