The wearable health record has become a reality.\u201d\n\nObviously, a physician is not going to be pulling up X-rays and analyzing PET scans on the small screen offered by a wristwatch. But that\u2019s not the point, company founders said.\n\nAs the screen size shrinks when one goes from the iPad to the iPhone to the watch, so does the range of different functions on drchrono\u2019s app, to some extent.\n\nDoctors wanting to input information on a health record by Drchrono will likely use the iPad, whereas perusing medical information can just as easily be done on a smartphone. A watch might not work well for entering or reading data, but is the perfect device to send a reminder to a physician that his or her next patient is waiting, Mr. Nusimow said.\n\nThe value, Mr. Nusimow said, is that health-record apps on all three devices sych up together, all link to Apple\u2019s Health Kit data repository, and all contribute to a patient\u2019s ongoing health narrative as told by their electronic health record.\n\nNo single mobile device needs to be all things to all people, if they all work together and interact with cloud-based health records, the company says.\n\nA separate application for patients, called OnPatient, will offer a range of tools for managing health on a daily basis, from offering reminders of upcoming appointments to messaging with health professionals to paying bills, Mr. Nusimow said.\n\nMountain View, Calif.-based drchrono has always been the most mobile of electronic health records, working closely with Apple as Apple unveils new mobile devices.\n\nThe company has been backed with about $8 million from Yuri Milner, Runa Capital, General Catalyst Partners and Falls River Ventures.\n\nDrchrono offers electronic health records for free, and monetizes its business by charging doctors for medical-billing services.\n\nMr. Nusimow said 70,000 doctors use the company\u2019s free digital health records, and about 3,000 pay for medical-billing services.\n\nWrite to Timothy Hay at timothy.hay@wsj.com.
