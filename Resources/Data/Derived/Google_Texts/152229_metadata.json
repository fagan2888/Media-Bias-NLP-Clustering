Ohio State wants to give the Obamacare flunky one of its highest honors.\n\nFormer Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius \u2013 an Ohio native \u2013 has been tapped to receive an honorary degree by the college\u2019s Committee on Honorary Degrees and its University Senate, and Ohio State\u2019s board of trustees is set to vote on the matter Friday.\n\nThe recommendation to the board gushed in part that \u201cas Secretary, Ms. Sebelius led ambitious efforts to improve America\u2019s health and enhance the delivery of human services to some of the nation\u2019s most vulnerable populations, including young children, those with disabilities, and the elderly.\u201d\n\nTry not to choke on your coffee when you read the resolution\u2019s next line:\n\n\u201cIn addition, Ms. Sebelius was committed to ensuring that America continues to lead the world in innovation.\u201d\n\nTo be fair, she had a distinguished career before the Obamacare fiasco. But it\u2019s hard to forget how she went out.\n\nAdding salt to the wound, Columbus Business First reports that \u201cthe honorary degree proposal came out in Monday\u2019s Ohio State board of trustees\u2019 agenda. That was the same day Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine sued the Obama administration over the Affordable Care Act. DeWine, Warren County and four Ohio universities said in a federal lawsuit that $6.25 million in Affordable Care Act taxes on self-funded health insurance plans for public workers are unconstitutional.\u201d\n\nUPDATE: Got this on Twitter, thought I\u2019d share:\n\n@JenniferKabbany College Fix post on Ohio St. & Kathleen Sebelius should note she is daughter of fmr Ohio Gov. \u2013 very connected in OH pols \u2014 EJ Hill (@RicochetEJHill) January 28, 2015\n\nJennifer Kabbany is editor of The College Fix (@JenniferKabbany)\n\nLike The College Fix on Facebook / Follow us on Twitter\n\nIMAGE: United Nations Office at Geneva, Switzerland", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The College Fix", "description": "Faculty heaps praise on Obamacare flunky.", "title": "Ohio State wants to give Kathleen Sebelius an honorary degree - The College Fix", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 305, "identifier": "http://www.thecollegefix.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/KathleenSebelius.jpg", "height": 310}, "updated_time": "2015-05-28T17:46:39-04:00", "url": "http://www.thecollegefix.com/post/21020/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.thecollegefix.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/KathleenSebelius.jpg", "description": "Faculty heaps praise on Obamacare flunky.", "card": "summary", "title": "Ohio State wants to give Kathleen Sebelius an honorary degree - The College Fix"}, "fb": {"admins": "672627547,1540010264,100009162449428", "app_id": 1559699120988871}, "article": {"section": "Editors' Corner", "tag": "Ohio State", "published_time": "2015-01-28T03:33:02-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-28T17:46:39-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u2013 very connected in OH pols \u2014 EJ Hill (@RicochetEJHill) January 28, 2015Jennifer Kabbany is editor of The College Fix (@JenniferKabbany)Like The College Fix on Facebook / Follow us on TwitterIMAGE: United Nations Office at Geneva, Switzerland\nRemember the lady who flubbed the Affordable Care Act roll out so badly that she resigned in disgrace?\nThat was the same day Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine sued the Obama administration over the Affordable Care Act.\nAdding salt to the wound, Columbus Business First reports that \u201cthe honorary degree proposal came out in Monday\u2019s Ohio State board of trustees\u2019 agenda.\nFormer Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius \u2013 an Ohio native \u2013 has been tapped to receive an honorary degree by the college\u2019s Committee on Honorary Degrees and its University Senate, and Ohio State\u2019s board of trustees is set to vote on the matter Friday."}
