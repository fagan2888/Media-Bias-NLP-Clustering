But if we start broadening that, then essentially I would be ignoring the law in a way that I think would be very difficult to defend legally.

We'll just have the president sign something and that'll take care of it and we won't have to worry about it,\u2019\u201d Obama said.\n\nObama has previously said that he cannot halt deportation orders, even as the prospects of the passage of comprehensive immigration reform in Congress have continued to fade.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio of Florida, a leading Republican advocate for reform, warned last month that Obama would be \u201ctempted\u201d to legalize undocumented immigrants \u201cwith the stroke of a pen\u201d if Congress stonewalled the bipartisan compromise bill.\n\nSweeping comprehensive immigration legislation passed the Senate in June, but the GOP-led House has declined to take up the upper chamber\u2019s bill, with leaders saying they hope to bring up smaller pieces of legislation to address border security and employment verification.\n\nOn Tuesday, Obama placed blame for the stall squarely with House Speaker John Boehner, saying that the Senate-passed bill would be approved with Democratic and Republican support if Boehner allowed the legislation to come to a vote.\n\n\u201cThis is really a question that should be directed to Mr. John Boehner. What's stopping him from going ahead and calling that bill?\u201d Obama said, adding that the House Speaker \u201cshouldn't be afraid of majority opinion on this thing.\u201d\n\nThe president added that he will still support a series of bills passed through the House piece-by-piece as long as they include the White House\u2019s policy goals, including a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.\n\n\u201cThere's a path to get this done, and that's through Congress,\u201d Obama said. \u201cAnd right now, everybody should be focused on making sure that that bill that's already passed out of the Senate hits the floor of the House of Representatives.\u201d\n\nA Boehner spokesman affirmed that the Speaker believes the House must take a \"step-by-step\" approach.\n\n\"If immigration reform is going to work, it is essential that we have the confidence of the American people that it\u2019s done the right way,\" said spokesman Brendan Buck. \"That means a deliberate, step-by-step approach, not another massive Obamacare-style bill that people don\u2019t understand.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Barack Obama said Tuesday that it is \u201cnot an option\u201d for his administration to take executive action to freeze the deportations of parents of children brought to the United States illegally, a move that immigrant rights advocates have pushed him to take if Congress fails to pass immigration reform legislation this year.", "og": {"url": "http://www.nbcnews.com/news/other/obama-wont-halt-deportations-parents-children-brought-us-illegally-f4B11187977", "type": "article", "image": "http://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/images/og-nbcnews200x200.gif", "site_name": "NBC News", "description": "President Barack Obama said Tuesday that it is \u201cnot an option\u201d for his administration to take executive action to freeze the deportations of parents of children brought to the United States illegally, a move that immigrant rights advocates have pushed him to take if Congress fails to pass immigration reform legislation this year."}, "twitter": {"domain": "NBCNews.com", "description": "President Barack Obama said Tuesday that it is \u201cnot an option\u201d for his administration to take executive action to freeze the deportations of parents of children brought to the United States illegally, a move that immigrant rights advocates have pushed him to take if Congress fails to pass immigration reform legislation this year.", "creator": "NBCNews", "image": {"src": "http://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/images/og-nbcnews200x200.gif"}, "title": "Obama won't halt deportations for parents of children brought to US illegally - NBC News", "site": "NBCNews", "card": "summary"}, "blitz": "mu-e1e842c9-946002e6-ea8f0454-41b29546", "DC.date.issued": "2013-09-17", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=319740707, app-argument=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/other/obama-wont-halt-deportations-parents-children-brought-us-illegally-f4B11187977", "fb": {"app_id": 10150138890205613}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/NBCNews"}, "google-site-verification": "K8bowvEbzWfPQ76x6f9SCxMVwicVXrhiClRg80ak8ZA", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "News,Other"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9e38\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThere's a path to get this done, and that's through Congress,\u201d Obama said.\nSo that's not an option.\u201dPlay FacebookTwitterGoogle PlusEmbed What's next for immigration reform?\nObama has previously said that he cannot halt deportation orders, even as the prospects of the passage of comprehensive immigration reform in Congress have continued to fade.\n\"If immigration reform is going to work, it is essential that we have the confidence of the American people that it\u2019s done the right way,\" said spokesman Brendan Buck.\nWe'll just have the president sign something and that'll take care of it and we won't have to worry about it,\u2019\u201d Obama said."}
