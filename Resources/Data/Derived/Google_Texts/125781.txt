The LA Weekly has more details of what was said inside Donald Trump’s private address to the Friends of Abe in Hollywood — and which entertainment-world conservatives were in attendance.

Trump, according to the alternative weekly — which sources their account to someone inside the room who wishes to remain anonymous — said that the U.S. should not have invaded Iraq. He couched his criticism of George W. Bush in geopolitics, and argued that a strong Iraq was a necessary counter-balance against Iran.

All reasonable enough. Until this: “Instead, we should have invaded Mexico.”

According to the paper, “The remark was greeted with rousing applause, our source said.”
