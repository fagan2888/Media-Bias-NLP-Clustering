The latest comes from the Arkansas Senate race, where incumbent Mark Pryor, a Democrat, faces U.S. Rep. Tom Cotton, a Republican.\n\nRecently, they traded jabs over Medicare funding.\n\n\"Some politicians like Tom Cotton voted to cut Social Security, turn Medicare into a voucher system and raise the age of eligibility to 70,\" Pryor\u2019s ad said . \"Pryor cut Medicare to pay for Obamacare,\" Cotton\u2019s ad shot back .\n\nWe\u2019ve addressed Pryor\u2019s claim in a separate fact-check. Here, we\u2019ll focus on Cotton\u2019s assertion that the Affordable Care Act strips Medicare funding. Cotton\u2019s office didn\u2019t respond to our requests for comment, but we did hear from Pryor\u2019s folks.\n\nWe\u2019re certainly no stranger to different versions of this claim. There is a connection between the Affordable Care Act and cuts to Medicare funding.\n\nBoth parties have recognized a need to rein in Medicare costs, which were growing at an annual rate of 6.8 percent in 2010, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\n\"Without reform, the nation\u2019s already excessive health care spending would have reached unsustainable levels within the next few decades,\" the 2010 CMS report read.\n\nWith the enactment of the health care law, Medicare\u2019s growth was projected to slow to 5.3 percent, according to the same CMS report. Over time, CMS predicts this will result in a 10-year savings of more than $700 billion.\n\nThe savings will come from reductions to Medicare Advantage, which represents a subset of Medicare plans run by private insurers. In additions, hospitals will be paid less if they don\u2019t meet certain benchmarks for patient care. The law\u2019s intent was to save money by making the system more efficient and without making reductions in benefits.\n\nSo Obamacare doesn\u2019t \"cut\" Medicare funding that already exists. Rather, it controls future spending, which politicians on both sides of the aisle called for.\n\nThe cost control \"is part of what Congress does to try to manage the insanely complex and expensive Medicare system,\" said Jay Wolfson, a public health professor at the University of South Florida. \"It is not new, nor is it partisan.\"\n\nWhen Mark Pryor voted with the Senate to pass Obamacare in 2009, he wasn\u2019t voting to cut Medicare. He was voting to slow its growth.\n\nThe goal is to reallocate some of the money saved toward Obamacare\u2019s goal of covering the currently uninsured, said Timothy Jost, a Washington and Lee University health policy law professor. So the savings are designed to offset costs in Obamacare so that the law doesn\u2019t increase the national deficit.\n\nOur ruling\n\nCotton\u2019s ad claimed that \"Pryor cut Medicare to pay for Obamacare.\" In reality, the Affordable Care Act calls for a slowed growth of Medicare funding, not a slash to current funds. The savings from this approach will be used to offset Obamacare costs. Because the ad doesn\u2019t make this clear, we rate Cotton\u2019s claim Half True.", "article_metadata": {"description": "So far, PolitiFact has heard some familiar attacks in the 2014 midterm election campaign rhetoric.
