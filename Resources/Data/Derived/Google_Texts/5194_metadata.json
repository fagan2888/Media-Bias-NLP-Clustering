Those businesses have been thrust into the spotlight by a national campaign aimed at organizing franchise employees and increasing the minimum wage to $15 per hour.\n\nThe day Caldeira spoke with The Hill, fast food workers and union organizers were orchestrating walkouts nationwide, just a few days after President Obama visited Wisconsin for Labor Day to rally with union workers for a minimum wage boost.\n\nCaldeira said the attention-grabbing protests were a politically motivated ploy by the Service Employees International Union (SEIU).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a special interest play by the SEIU to garner attention ... try to turn the tide on their dwindling member ranks and coffers,\u201d he said.\n\nCaldeira vowed the franchise association would mount an active response to the campaign.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been very aggressive in pushing back, and we\u2019re going to continue to be aggressive,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will keep the pedal to the metal, I can assure you.\u201d\n\nThe SEIU is quick to rebut the claims of Caldeira and other business groups, and noted that hundreds of fast-food employees were arrested during the protests last week.\n\n\u201cLast Thursday, nearly 500 fast-food workers were arrested because we took a stand to say we should be paid enough to afford three meals a day, bus fare and rent,\u201d said Terrance Wise, a Kansas City, Mo., Burger King\n\nemployee. \u201cFast-food corporations keep trying to pretend that we don\u2019t exist, but while they are burying their heads in the sand, our movement is growing. We\u2019re not going to stop until we win $15 and union rights.\u201d\n\nCaldeira is leading an IFA that is stronger than ever before, thanks to growth in membership and revenue during his tenure.\n\nThe IFA was pulling in $10.1 million in funding in 2010, the year Caldeira came on board, but is projected to clear $16 million in the next fiscal year. The association has expanded from 32 employees in 2010 to 45, with most of the new hires joining the government relations and communications teams.\n\n\u201cWe were always good. I think Steve has put us to great. We really are a go-to trade association,\u201d said Jon Luther, chairman and former CEO of Dunkin\u2019 Brands, where he worked with Caldeira before joining the IFA.\n\nCaldeira hopes to leverage the group\u2019s resources for increased political clout. Under his watch, the IFA has grown its political action committee, raising roughly $1.2 million in 2012 and $894,000 in 2014, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics.\n\nThe group has doled out nearly $432,000 to candidates this election cycle, mostly to Republicans, compared to just $304,000 back in 2010.\n\nCaldeira said the increase is part of a \u201cmore aggressive\u201d stance he wants the association to take by getting involved early in campaigns and making its case at every opportunity with policymakers and in the media.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been much more aggressive in our willingness to get out there and tell the story,\u201d he said. \u201cThe nature of the game has changed.\u201d\n\nThe influence of the IFA chief has spread beyond his own group. Caldeira also works closely with the Chamber of Commerce, sitting on several committees within the nation\u2019s largest business lobby.\n\nThe Chamber has received intense media attention for its decision this election cycle to jump into races at the primary level, boosting business-friendly candidates while looking to oust lawmakers, including some Republicans, who have voted against their interests.\n\nEngstrom said Caldeira was one of a handful of people who pushed the Chamber to make the leap into primaries.\n\n\u201cSteve, in particular, helped us lean forward more fully in primary season ... he\u2019s one of the architects of that primary strategy,\u201d he said. \u201cLiterally, there\u2019s not a week that goes by that I\u2019m not on the phone with Steve at all hours of the days and night.\u201d\n\nThe IFA has had its hands full over the last year or so, battling against efforts to hike the minimum wage at both the state and local level.\n\nCaldeira argues a higher minimum wage would upend a franchise business model that has outpaced other sectors of the economy since the recession.\n\nThe challenges of being a fast-food worker are familiar to Caldeira, who spent time flipping burgers at a Burger King during his senior year at Providence College in Rhode Island. He said his paycheck went toward gas money and drinks and dinner with friends, and said the jobs should only be temporary for people.\n\nThe minimum wage \u201cwas never meant to support a family of four,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was meant to be a wage that got people into the workforce, taught them important skills.\u201d\n\nWhile the economic downturn forced many laid-off adults into minimum-wage jobs, Caldeira said it\u2019s unfair to expect franchises to shoulder a heavier burden just because the broader economy isn\u2019t producing higher-paying jobs.\n\nIn Seattle, the IFA is leading a lawsuit against that city\u2019s recently enacted $15 minimum wage. Specifically, the group is challenging a provision of the law that treats franchises as parts of a large business, rather than individual small ones. That means franchises need to begin paying the higher wage much more quickly, compared to small businesses that get a longer transition.\n\nBefore joining the IFA, Caldeira spent several years working in the private sector, in trade associations and on Capitol Hill. He joined the IFA after working as an executive for Dunkin\u2019 Brands, where he was charged with a similar task of boosting the messaging for the company and its profile.\n\nIn the political arena, Caldeira put in stints at the Chamber, and has served as New York political director for former Sen. Al D\u2019Amato (R-N.Y.) and legislative assistant to former Rep. Greg Carman (R-N.Y.).\n\nWhile the IFA represents some of the biggest corporations in the world, Caldeira emphasizes it also represents small businesses nationwide that make those franchises happen. Later this month, the IFA will fly in hundreds of small-business owners to Washington, who will take to Capitol Hill to make their case.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no greater spokespeople than these local entrepreneurs,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Steve Caldeira is doing battle on multiple fronts in a midterm election year.", "description": "Steve Caldeira is doing battle on multiple fronts in a midterm election year.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Peter Schroeder", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Steve Caldeira is doing battle on multiple fronts in a midterm election year.", "title": "Franchise association chief ready for battle", "url": "http://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/lobbyist-profiles/217045-franchise-association-chief-ready-for-battle", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/calderiasteve_090414gn.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T04:20:37-05:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T04:20-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/lobbyist-profiles/217045-franchise-association-chief-ready-for-battle", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2014-09-09T06:00-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Garrett Evans", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-09T06:00:03-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T04:20:37-05:00"}, "keywords": ",,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/lobbyist-profiles/217045-franchise-association-chief-ready-for-battle", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Steve Caldeira is doing battle on multiple fronts in a midterm election year.", "card": "summary", "title": "Franchise association chief ready for battle"}, "dcterms.title": "Franchise association chief ready for battle"}, "article_summary": "Caldeira\u2019s group, the International Franchise Association (IFA), represents global brands including McDonald\u2019s, Dunkin\u2019 Donuts and Marriott that operate through locally owned franchises.\nCaldeira vowed the franchise association would mount an active response to the campaign.\nBefore joining the IFA, Caldeira spent several years working in the private sector, in trade associations and on Capitol Hill.\nThose businesses have been thrust into the spotlight by a national campaign aimed at organizing franchise employees and increasing the minimum wage to $15 per hour.\nSteve Caldeira is at the center of the storm as the chief representative for franchise brands in Washington."}
