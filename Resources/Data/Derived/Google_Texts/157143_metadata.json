You may not recognize the name, but Luxottica owns brands including Ray-Ban, Oakley, Vogue-Eyewear, Persol, Oliver Peoples, Alain Mikli, and Arnette. It also boasts more than 5,000 retail stores in the United States.\n\nGoogle sees this partnership as the \u201cstart of a new chapter in Glass\u2019s design.\u201d It\u2019s also the obvious next step to take after Google launched the Titanium Collection of frames designed by the Glass team earlier this year.\n\nThe terms of the partnership haven\u2019t yet been detailed, and Google makes it very clear that you\u2019re \u201cnot going to see Glass on your favorite Oakleys or Ray-Bans tomorrow.\u201d Instead, this is a partnership for the future.\n\nThere has been speculation that the emergence of Google Wear for smartwatches means the Glass form factor isn\u2019t top of the agenda for Google, but this partnership suggests it isn\u2019t giving up on it quite yet. We just wish Google Glass was available to all, and for a price less than the current $1,500.\n\nObama First Verified Account On Quora\n\nBarack Obama\u2019s social media team has joined Quora. \u2014 drew olanoff (@drew) March 24, 2014\n\nQuora has introduced Verified Accounts, with U.S. President Barack Obama the first recipient of the honor. Obama \u2014 or at least his social media team \u2014 launched the initiative by answering questions about the Affordable Care Act.\n\nOther public figures in the first round of verification include Ashton Kutcher, Ethan Hawke, Sheryl Sandberg, Reed Hastings, Michael Buble, and Jason Bateman (he of Arrested Development fame). All of whom will have blue tick against both their name and their contributions to the site.\n\nIceland Launches Auroracoin Airdrop\n\nThe next big test for cryptocurrencies is about to play out in Iceland, where every citizen is being given 31.8 Auroracoin. The Litecoin-based digital currency launched in February and is (at the time of writing) worth around .02 Bitcoin or US$11.60.\n\nGiving a virtual handful of Auroracoin to Icelanders is designed to help get the Icelandic economy moving again. As pointed out by Forbes, a similar plan is due to be enacted in Spain next month, with Spanish citizens being given a clutch of Spaincoin.\n\nIf these initiatives work in encouraging spending and growth then expect to see other countries joining in with the cryptofun.\n\nATMs Could Soon Be Using Linux\n\nATMs could soon be powered by Linux, with operators looking at alternatives once Microsoft ends support for Windows XP. A surprising 95 percent of ATMs currently run on Windows XP, which doesn\u2019t bode well for their security beyond April 8.\n\nAccording to Computerworld, ATM operators are now eyeing Linux as a possible replacement, in an effort to \u201csynch up their hardware and software upgrades.\u201d If operators don\u2019t act soon then we may be seeing more of the kind of fun witnessed in the NSFW video above.\n\nLearnist Gets A Visual Overhaul\n\nEducational startup Learnist has been given a makeover, with a new design, new categories, and a reading list having been added to the website. Learnist works a lot like Pinterest, with Learnboards \u2014 of which there are now more than 500,000 \u2014 being used to organize educational content.\n\nYou learn something new every day. Hopefully by reading MakeUseOf.\n\nMinus Jon Plus Jon Isn\u2019t Garfield\n\nAnd finally, move over Garfield Minus Garfield, as there\u2019s a new parody in town. Minus Jon Plus Jon (as discovered by Geekosystem) removes not only Garfield but his owner Jon Arbuckle as well.\n\nOne Jon is replaced by another Jon; Jon Osterman AKA Dr. Manhattan from the Watchmen graphic novel. Which lends the whole thing a moody vibe that you would never guess originated in a Garfield comic strip.\n\nTech News Digest\u2026 Breaking News Into Bite-Sized Chunks.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Comics,Google Glass,", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.makeuseof.makeuseof", "og": {"site_name": "MakeUseOf", "description": "Today in Tech News Digest, Google Glass gets designer appeal, Quora launches Verified Accounts, Iceland gives away Auroracoin, ATMs using Linux, Learnist is overhauled, and Minus Jon Plus Jon is definitely not Garfield.
