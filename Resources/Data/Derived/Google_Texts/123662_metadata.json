Facebook\n\nIn New York City, all you hear about these days from yoga enthusiasts is hot yoga and bikram \u2014 an hour or two of sweating out all your stress in a high heat room, and how amazing it makes you feel afterward. But it just gets weirder from there. For one thing, it appears we\u2019re missing out on what\u2019s going on in West Coast yoga studios: \u201cpot yoga,\u201d also known as cannabis-enhanced Ganja yoga, where yogis use marijuana to bring them to a totally new spiritual level.\n\nThe trend isn\u2019t exactly new \u2014 certified Hatha Yoga instructor Dee Dussault has been offering such classes in Toronto since 2009, and brought them to San Francisco in October. According to Dussault, \u201cthese \u2018enhanced\u2019 yoga and tantra journeys are opportunities for you to enjoy trippy relaxation, pain-relief, sensuality, and the cultivation of inner peace.\u201d\n\nThe original Ganja Yoga started in Toronto. According to John, one of Toronto\u2019s Ganja Yoga instructors, \"the smoking of Ganja (cannabis) is regarded as a sacred act\u2026 intoxication as a \u2018respected\u2019 method of self- realization, it is related to Soma, the nectar of the gods, which is spoken of in the Vedic texts as a means to open the heart mind and body.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re into that sort of thing, it looks like you might have to take a cross-country road trip to San Francisco sometime soon. In the meantime, you might be able to find some other weird forms of yoga in your own city \u2014 if you\u2019re looking to experiment.\n\nNaked Yoga\n\nShed your worries and insecurities with naked yoga.

Facebook\n\nThey're not acrobats \u2014 they're aerial yogis. Facebook\n\nIn aerial yoga, you spend most of your time suspended in the air by a soft hammock. While this may seem more like acrobatics than yoga, it\u2019s an interesting way for you to change up your yoga positions and sometimes rely even more on your strength to keep yourself lifted up and balanced in the air. At times, you might even feel like you\u2019re on a magic carpet of sorts.\n\nYoga For Foodies\n\nThis type of yoga will help you slow down, and not only stretch and exercise \u2014 but also learn how to enjoy the act of eating more fully. \u201cWhen we move in a frenzied way through the day, we don\u2019t eat\u2026we \u2018feed,\u2019\u201d states one release about a NYC Yoga for Foodies event. \u201cThis high-velocity lifestyle diminishes the flavor and essence of life. \u2026 As you enjoy a post-yoga splendor, [the instructor] will delve deeper into his creations and philosophy that are rooted in cooking as an experience focused as much on emotion and intuition as on following a recipe.\u201d\n\nDoga\n\nDogs love yoga just as much as humans. istolethetv / CC BY 2.0\n\nThe name sounds like what it is \u2014 it\u2019s yoga for you and your dog. \u201cLike yoga, doga balances, harmonizes, purifies and transcends the body and mind of the practitioner,\u201d doga teacher Madhavi Bhatia says. \u201cWhat makes doga unique is the practice and benefits that create a harmony and synchronization of energy flow between the owner and dog.\u201d\n\nIndeed, doga can help you connect with your dog \u2014 even if you think you\u2019re already best friends. Kari Harendorf, owner of East Yoga in New York City, says: \u201cDoga brings us back to more simple things\u2026 We\u2019re so busy, so plugged in with the cell phone and the Blackberry and the pagers. We can walk our dogs and not pay attention to them. Doga is 45 minutes of undivided attention. It is a gift.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "pot yoga, naked yoga, weird yoga trends, ganja yoga", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "If you\u2019re looking to check out new forms of yoga, look no further than the strange but spiritual trends of pot yoga, naked yoga, and doga.", "title": "Cannabis-Enhanced 'Pot Yoga,' And 4 Other Weird Yoga Trends [PHOTOS]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/hot-yoga-how-about-pot-yoga-and-several-other-weird-yoga-trends-315004", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/19/pot-yoga.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "If you\u2019re looking to check out new forms of yoga, look no further than the strange but spiritual trends of pot yoga, naked yoga, and doga.", "title": "Cannabis-Enhanced 'Pot Yoga,' And 4 Other Weird Yoga Trends [PHOTOS]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/hot-yoga-how-about-pot-yoga-and-several-other-weird-yoga-trends-315004", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/19/pot-yoga.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/19/pot-yoga.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Vitality", "published_time": "2014-12-19T14:56:20-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-19T14:56:19-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "If you\u2019re looking to check out new forms of yoga, look no further than the strange but spiritual trends of pot yoga, naked yoga, and doga."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3fb2\"", "article_summary": "Smoke up and get into your yoga poses: \"Ganja yoga\" provides yogis with a chance to enhance spirituality with weed.\nFor one thing, it appears we\u2019re missing out on what\u2019s going on in West Coast yoga studios: \u201cpot yoga,\u201d also known as cannabis-enhanced Ganja yoga, where yogis use marijuana to bring them to a totally new spiritual level.\n\u201cLike yoga, doga balances, harmonizes, purifies and transcends the body and mind of the practitioner,\u201d doga teacher Madhavi Bhatia says.\nIn the meantime, you might be able to find some other weird forms of yoga in your own city \u2014 if you\u2019re looking to experiment.\nAccording to Dussault, \u201cthese \u2018enhanced\u2019 yoga and tantra journeys are opportunities for you to enjoy trippy relaxation, pain-relief, sensuality, and the cultivation of inner peace.\u201dThe original Ganja Yoga started in Toronto."}
