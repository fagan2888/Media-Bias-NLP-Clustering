He has served as lead artist on four other panels at the Great Mural Wall of Topeka, S.W. 20th and Western.\n\nThe wall was started in 2006 when Chesney Park Neighborhood Improvement Association members power-washed a 60-foot section of the 11-foot-tall wall of a former water reservoir.\n\nThe wall stretches 900 feet on its east, south, west and north sides.\n\nPanels include a Tribute to Grant Cushinberry, The Road From Brown v. Board, Reanimating the Arts in Topeka, the Kansas Women\u2019s Mural and more.\n\nOther lead artists have been Ashley Jane Laird and KT Walsh. Panels have been painted by neighborhood children, Topeka High School students and people from all around the city.\n\n\u201cOne thing has led to another,\u201d Loewenstein said. \u201cIt\u2019s really a grassroots effort.\u201d\n\nAshley Russell, a Washburn University student, is Loewenstein\u2019s assistant for this panel. He hopes Russell will be able to serve as a lead artist on a future panel. However, space is quickly vanishing as more panels are added.\n\nAbout 50 people stopped by last weekend to help Loewenstein during community paint days. People again were welcome to paint Saturday \u2014 the threat of rain kept some away. The last community paint day for this panel will be from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. Sunday. However, people are always invited to stop by and lend a hand \u2014 or brush.\n\n\u201cI think by the end of the month we should be done,\u201d Loewenstein said.\n\nPlanning for How Topeka Got Its Name began in the fall with a design process, Loewenstein said. Jimm GoodTracks, of the Ioway Tribe, and others helped research how Topeka received its name. The word \u201cTopeka\u201d comes from an Ioway word meaning \u201ca good place to dig for potatoes\u201d (also called prairie potatoes or prairie turnips).\n\n\u201cIt was a staple crop for that tribe,\u201d Loewenstein said. \u201cIt was an important food source.\u201d\n\nThe panel will show the prairie potato plant and members of the Ioway tribe showing others the plant. It also will depict a classroom teacher telling the \u201cfolk story\u201d about how a Native American looked down at his moccasin and discovered his toe peeking out \u2014 thus leading founding fathers to name the town Topeka.\n\n\u201cThis is an opportunity to talk about some of the Native American heritage and folk stories,\u201d Loewenstein said.\n\nThe muralist encourages everyone to help him out Sunday. Participants don\u2019t have to be artists, and all materials will be provided.\n\n\u201cThis is a muralist\u2019s dream come true,\u201d Loewenstein said of the Great Mural Wall of Topeka. \u201cThere is so much great collaboration.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "News, Local, Ann Marie Bush", "og": {"site_name": "CJOnline.com", "description": "A few raindrops Saturday afternoon didn't keep Lawrence muralist Dave Loewenstein from picking up his brush and working on the next panel of the Great Wall of Topeka.", "title": "Community invited to paint alongside Lawrence muralist at Great Mural Wall of Topeka", "url": "http://cjonline.com/news/2015-05-02/community-invited-paint-alongside-lawrence-muralist-great-mural-wall-topeka", "image": "http://cjonline.com/sites/default/files/14352307.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "A few raindrops Saturday afternoon didn\u2019t keep Lawrence muralist Dave Loewenstein from picking up his brush and working on the next panel of the Great Wall of Topeka.Loewenstein is serving as the lead artist for the ninth panel on the wall, of which the theme is How Topeka Got Its Name.
