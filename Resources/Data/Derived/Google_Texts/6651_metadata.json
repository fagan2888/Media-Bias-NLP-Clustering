(Photo: CNN)\n\nWILMINGTON, NC (WWAY) \u2014 A former Wilmington resident vacationing in Paris is safe.\n\nRachel Colonna and her husband are currently vacationing in the city where 129 people were killed and hundreds more injured in a terrorist attack last night.\n\nColonna says they were fortunate enough to be indoors for the night, when they heard the news of the attack.\n\n\u201cThe streets were filled with noises of sirens and what sounded like bombings or slamming of car doors. You couldn\u2019t tell the difference,\u201d Colonna said.\n\nShe said they spent the remainder of the night indoors, with the lights out after a mandatory curfew was placed on the city. Their apartment is about one mile from the Bataclan Concert Hall where terrorists held 100 hostages.\n\nColonna said they briefly ventured outdoors today, but most businesses were closed, and the streets were empty.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not a sense of liveliness in the streets, and it\u2019s a little barren for a Saturday,\u201d she said.\n\nOn Monday, the couple plans to continue their vacation, traveling to London by train and they anticipate a \u201cheightened level of security.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere in Europe they\u2019re not used to this, people don\u2019t have licenses to carry guns, so this is extremely outside of their norm,\u201d Colonna said.\n\nColonna added that people in the city are making an effort to stay positive through the situation.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "WWAY TV3", "description": "A former Wilmington resident, who is vacationing in Paris, is safe.", "title": "Former Wilmington resident safe in Paris - WWAY TV3", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 956, "identifier": "http://www.wwaytv3.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/paris-attack-3-e1447468315187.jpg", "height": 720}, "updated_time": "2015-11-16T09:24:48-04:00", "url": "http://www.wwaytv3.com/2015/11/14/former-wilmington-resident-is-safe-in-paris/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wwaytv3", "published_time": "2015-11-14T15:18:16-04:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/MadisonMorganNews/", "section": "Local News", "modified_time": "2015-11-16T09:24:48-04:00", "tag": "Terrorist Attacks"}, "twitter": {"description": "A former Wilmington resident, who is vacationing in Paris, is safe.", "creator": "@MadisonMorganTV", "image": "http://i0.wp.com/www.wwaytv3.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/paris-attack-3-e1447468315187.jpg?resize=956%2C720", "title": "Former Wilmington resident safe in Paris - WWAY TV3", "site": "@wway", "card": "summary"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "(Photo: CNN)WILMINGTON, NC (WWAY) \u2014 A former Wilmington resident vacationing in Paris is safe.\nA former Wilmington resident, who is vacationing in Paris, France, is safe.\nShe said they spent the remainder of the night indoors, with the lights out after a mandatory curfew was placed on the city.\nColonna says they were fortunate enough to be indoors for the night, when they heard the news of the attack.\nColonna added that people in the city are making an effort to stay positive through the situation."}
