But the next year, they're more open to talk about it.\"\n\nLexi is one of 38 kids who spent the weekend with grief counselors and other kids her age, dealing with the loss of a loved one.\n\n\"The most special part is seeing them open up and being able to identify with what they're feeling and being able to express that,\" Co-Director Jason Adams said. \"And to begin to see a little healing take place.\"\n\nOrganizers say kids process death differently than adults. They say kids often express grief through art or play.\n\n\"It's wonderful to see them grow through it and leave here with some skills that they can take home,\" Sally Kapusciak, a social worker who works at the camp, said.\n\nKapusciak says it's important for children to have outlets outside of their immediate family.\n\nIn Lexi's case, it was a weekend in the woods.\n\n\"If I feel like I can't talk to my parents about something, I can come here and talk to my counselors,\" Lexi said.\n\nEmerald Coast Hospice holds Camp I Believe every summer, and it's free to sign up.
