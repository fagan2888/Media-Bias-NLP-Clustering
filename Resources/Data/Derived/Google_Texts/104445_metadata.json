If the client has only $20,000 in assets under management, which is fairly typical for many Americans, it wouldn\u2019t be worth the effort for just 1 percent of $20,000.\u201d\n\nWorst-Case Scenarios\n\nKnight says the government\u2019s justification for the rule is based on bad assumptions.\n\n\u201cA report from the President\u2019s Council of Economic Advisors came out earlier this year, claiming that \u2018conflicted advice\u2019 was costing Americans $17 billion a year,\u201d Knight said. \u201cThe report assumes that every broker is currently giving the worst advice and that people are buying only products with high fees, and that under a new rule every broker will continue doing the work [they\u2019re] doing, but will only advise people to buy products with the lowest fees, and that people will in fact always buy those products.\u201d\n\nObamacare For Your 401(k)\n\nJohn Berlau, a senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, says the Obama administration\u2019s proposed fiduciary rule is similar to Obamacare in key ways.\n\n\u201cPeople will lose brokers and other financial professionals they rely on, just as they lost health plans under Obamacare,\u201d Berlau said. \u201cThe big reason is that Obama officials themselves are the ones invoking medical analogies. Like Secretary of Labor Thomas Perez told reporters, \u2018you don't want your doctor telling you what's suitable for you; you want that doctor to tell you what's best for you.\u2019\n\n\u201cPerez doesn't seem to get something informed patients and investors know well: that there is not one answer of what is \u2018best for you,\u2019 in either medicine or retirement saving,\u201d Berlau said. \u201cSavers should have the freedom to weigh the potential risk and return of various investment plans. It's not the job of the DOL or any government agency to be our parent and protect us from our own judgment.\n\n\u201cWho is the Obama administration to decide we can't prudently manage our investments when it blew $500,000,000 on a failed green energy boondoggle with Solyndra,\u201d Berlau said.\n\nLuke Karnick (lkarnick@yahoo.com) writes from Indianapolis, Indiana.", "article_metadata": {}, "article_summary": "Lawmakers in Congress are fighting with U.S. Department Labor Secretary Thomas Perez and President Barack Obama over proposed new regulations on the investment industry.\n\u201cThe problem with putting brokers under the fiduciary duty standard is that it would make it difficult for many brokers to continue working on commission,\u201d Knight said.\n\u201cPeople will lose brokers and other financial professionals they rely on, just as they lost health plans under Obamacare,\u201d Berlau said.\n\u201cThe result of the new rule would likely be that most people would switch to a fee system.\nIt's not the job of the DOL or any government agency to be our parent and protect us from our own judgment."}
