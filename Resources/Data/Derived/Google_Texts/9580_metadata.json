[Fox News]\n\nFox News host Bill O\u2019Reilly delivered what he called a recipe for success for the newly-dominant Republican Party going into 2016 \u2014 including, he said, stopping any internal squabbling.\n\n\u201cIf the GOP takes my advice and then nominates an honest person to run for president in 2016, it will win,\u201d O\u2019Reilly said. \u201cIf Republicans continue to fight each other and don\u2019t compromise, the party will lose, and President Hillary Clinton will waltz into the Oval Office.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Reilly also advised Republicans to hold off on trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare, until they can elect someone in the next presidential election, arguing that current President Barack Obama will only veto any current attempts to curtail the law.\n\nThe O\u2019Reilly Factor host also argued in favor of a minimum wage increase to $10 per hour, saying it could be done without cutting into corporate profits by lowering the corporate income tax to 20 percent and the capital gains tax to 15 percent, as well as instituting a six-month amnesty period for companies to \u201cbring back\u201d money they currently hold overseas.\n\n\u201cIf President Obama vetoes these three things, he will go down in history as a villain,\u201d O\u2019Reilly argued.\n\nHe also said Republicans should cut off funding to any executive order Obama signs implementing immigration reform. Instead of that, he said, the GOP should introduce its own bill calling for the border to be \u201csecure\u201d before \u201chumanely dealing\u201d with undocumented immigrants currently in the U.S.\n\nHe did not mention that, as many immigration advocates have said, deportations have been at an all-time high during Obama\u2019s presidency, and that a bipartisan bill that passed in the Senate last year stalled in the GOP-controlled House.\n\nWatch O\u2019Reilly\u2019s commentary, as posted online on Thursday, below.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/fox_of_jesus_foodstamps_131204a-800x430.jpg", "height": 430}, "title": "Bill O\u2019Reilly\u2019s GOP 2016 tips: Nominate an \u2018honest person\u2019 and play nice or Hillary will win"}, "fb": {"app_id": 212555972273585}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "article_summary": "Fox News host Bill O'Reilly on Dec. 4, 2013.\n\u201cIf the GOP takes my advice and then nominates an honest person to run for president in 2016, it will win,\u201d O\u2019Reilly said.\n\u201cIf President Obama vetoes these three things, he will go down in history as a villain,\u201d O\u2019Reilly argued.\n[Fox News]Fox News host Bill O\u2019Reilly delivered what he called a recipe for success for the newly-dominant Republican Party going into 2016 \u2014 including, he said, stopping any internal squabbling.\nHe also said Republicans should cut off funding to any executive order Obama signs implementing immigration reform."}
