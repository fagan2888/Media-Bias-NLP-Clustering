Some people are probably not enjoying the publicity the Super Bowl is bringing.

New Jersey Governor Chris Christie was booed while he was onstage at the Super Bowl Hand-Off Ceremony in Times Square on Saturday.

Christie is currently at the center of the Bridge-gate scandal, where his staffers were caught shutting down a busy bridge to punish a mayor who didn’t back the governor.

Christie refused to take any questions after Saturday’s Super Bowl event.
