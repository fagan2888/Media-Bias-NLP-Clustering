I\u2019m afraid that ignoring this ugly fact makes Americans complicit in murder.\n\nIt is understandable why President Obama has made drone attacks his go-to weapon in the fight against terrorists and the Taliban. Armed, pilotless aircraft allow the CIA and the military to target individuals in enemy strongholds without putting U.S. lives at risk. But efficacy is not legitimacy, and I don\u2019t see how drone strikes can be considered a wholly legitimate way to wage war.\n\nThis is an unpopular view in Washington \u2014 especially at the White House, where Obama and his aides have done much to erase the stain on the nation\u2019s honor left by the excesses of George W. Bush\u2019s \u201cglobal war on terrorism.\u201d It is to his great credit that Obama ended torture, shut down the CIA\u2019s secret overseas prisons and made a good-faith effort to close the detention center at Guantanamo.\n\nBut Obama has greatly expanded the use of drones, and his version of the terror war looks a lot like a campaign of assassination.\n\nEven if the intelligence agents and military officers who operate the drones have perfect knowledge \u2014 meaning they are absolutely certain that the target is a dangerous enemy \u2014 and fire the drones\u2019 missiles with perfect accuracy, this amounts to summary execution. Is such killing morally defensible?\n\n1 of 8 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 What Obama didn\u2019t know View Photos The many controversies that the White House says the president was kept in the dark about.

Thousands who had bought insurance have been receiving cancellations notices from insurers. The president said he wasn\u2019t aware his promise before the rollout would result in cancellations, and Obama had repeatedly stated that, although new health-care insurance would be available through the Affordable Care Act, those willing to stay on their plan would be able to do so.In fact, that wasn\u2019t the case.

Obama sharply questioned that conceptual framework when he was running for president in 2008; these days, he uses the word \u201cwar\u201d frequently. But I have never heard him embrace the theory of a global Manichaean conflict in which, as Bush said, \u201cEither you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.\u201d\n\nUnder what theory, then, does the president order drone strikes in countries such as Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia, with which we are not at war? It would seem the definition of \u201cenemy\u201d is, basically, \u201csomeone the United States decides to target.\u201d\n\nI have considerable faith in Obama to make careful, sober decisions about who should be considered an enemy to be targeted, and I know he agonizes over pulling the trigger. But that is cold comfort. Bush\u2019s theory of war was clear and morally indefensible. Obama\u2019s is fuzzy and morally ambiguous.\n\nAll this is true even if the drones kill only their targets. But of course there is \u201ccollateral damage.\u201d\n\nAfghan President Hamid Karzai has threatened not to sign a long-term security agreement with the United States because of a drone attack last week that killed a 2-year-old child and wounded two women. Karzai is a corrupt and unreliable ally, and this is just the latest in a string of reasons he has given for vacillating on the pact. But he has good reason to complain about this atrocity \u2014 as was acknowledged when the top U.S. general in Afghanistan offered a formal apology.\n\nHow many civilians have been killed in drone strikes? The Obama administration refuses to say but insists that the toll, whatever it may be, is declining because of stricter rules on choosing targets.\n\nIn Afghanistan, it is hard to attempt a count because there is an actual war going on, with no agreement on who qualifies as a civilian. The Los Angeles Times wrote recently about a Sept. 7 drone strike in Kunar Province. U.S. officials told the paper that 11 people died, most of them Taliban fighters; grieving local residents, however, insisted that 14 civilians had been killed. When does a village cease being a village and become a \u201cTaliban stronghold\u201d? When we say so, apparently.\n\nThe nonpartisan New America Foundation, which has attempted to keep a running tally, says drone strikes under both presidents have killed between 258 and 307 civilians in Pakistan, and between 66 and 68 in Yemen. Those numbers may seem small, but each victim was a human being who posed no threat to the United States or its interests \u2014 in some cases a child who was here one minute, full of laughter and life\u2019s promise, and gone the next.\n\nI believe historians will look at Obama\u2019s second term and see the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, despite its rocky launch, as a great moral triumph. I fear they will see the drone war as a great moral failure.\n\nRead more from Eugene Robinson\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.
