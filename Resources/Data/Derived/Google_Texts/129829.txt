As it has lost battleground in Iraq and Syria, the Islamic State group has ramped up its propaganda campaign by beheading hostages.

U.S. officials call it a sign of weakness that shows the militants are trying to use whatever they can to maintain support and inspire recruits, even as the group suffers military setbacks in its push to create a religious empire across the two countries.

An estimated 15 to 20 hostages are still being held by the Islamic State, including two Americans.

The militants overran the northern Iraqi city of Mosul on June 8, and quickly captured a number of other cities. They were closing in on the Iraqi Kurdish capital of Irbil when the U.S. first launched airstrikes against the Islamic State fighters Aug. 8.
