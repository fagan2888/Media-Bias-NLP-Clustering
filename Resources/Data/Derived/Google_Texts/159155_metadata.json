Capitol Hill developer Liz Dunn is about to unveil her office space and market project Chophouse Row this fall on 11th Ave. Other office space-centered projects are expected in coming years.\n\nThe group, which used to be known as Lifelong AIDS Alliance, and before that as the Northwest AIDS Foundation, had outgrown the old space, which had served as its home for more than 25 years.\n\nIn May, CHS reported that the Bright Horizons day care chain was making plans to open a center and take over the former Lifelong space in a $1.7 million overhaul that will include a \u201cMovement Matters Zone with Rock Climbing Wall,\u201d art studio, and playgrounds.\n\nBright Horizons is a CHS advertiser while CHS is a community sponsor of the annual Lifelong AIDS Walk and 5K.\n\nBray said Lifelong has expanded its focus in recent years, reaching out to assist people with other chronic diseases, hence dropping \u201cAIDS Alliance\u201d from their name.\n\nBray said Lifelong has split the dual aspects of its mission into two different physical locations. The counseling center is located on Pike. The group\u2019s food prep arm (the Chicken Soup Brigade) has moved preparation to Georgetown. The group\u2019s thrift store, by the way, can still be found at 1017 E Union.\n\nThe move and expansion for Lifelong is being powered in part by a grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\nMeanwhile, the Out of the Closet thrift shop and HIV/AIDS center will join Lifelong on E Pike.\n\nBray said that Lifelong\u2019s food distribution will continue to take place in the old location (1002 E Seneca), so clients need not figure out how to get to Georgetown for their meals. But the new space in Georgetown should give them the added capacity to ramp up meal production and serve more people in the future, once sufficient funding is available.\n\nLast year, Bray said LIfelong distributed 149,872 meals and 36,330 bags of groceries.\n\nThe meals, she noted, are considered \u201cmedically appropriate\u201d which can mean a very particular diet for someone with a compromised immune system. Generally, it\u2019s the sort of low-sodium, low-fat, high-fiber diet that the doctors say we should all be eating anyway.\n\n\u201cThe food that we\u2019re giving people is really good for them,\u201d she said.\n\nBetween meals and counseling, they served 4,759 people 2013, Bray said.\n\nFor those in need of counseling, the Pike Street location is ready to help, Bray said.\n\nClients will even be greeted by some familiar faces, such as 14-year volunteer Jim Hunter. Hunter, one of 1,026 volunteers at Lifelong, started volunteering after first using their services as a client. He said when he needed it, he found help tracking down food, insurance, healthcare and counseling, and he wanted to give back.\n\n\u201cIt makes me feel like I\u2019m part of a huge family that does wonderful things for people with HIV and AIDS,\u201d Hunter said. \u201cI look forward to coming in every single week.\u201d\n\nHunter said he\u2019s been doing much better than he had when he first walked in the door, but he might still have a down day now and again.\n\n\u201cI know that when I do have my downs, I have a support system here.\u201d\n\nBray said one of the main focuses is making sure that people get, and stay, on their medication. If they do that, it can often help reduce the chances for them to spread HIV to others. One study Bray cited said that people with HIV who have an undetectable viral load are 96 percent less likely to transmit it. The popular phrase, she said, is now \u201ctreatment as prevention.\u201d\n\nBeyond the meds, counselors can help people navigate the health insurance exchanges. Obamacare, she said, has made their jobs a bit easier, but it\u2019s still not simple signing up clients who often face issues such as chemical dependence, homelessness and poverty.\n\nOne thing they could certainly use, said Bray, is more financial support from the community, which is one of the reasons they are sponsoring their 28th annual AIDS walk. This year\u2019s walk starts with registration at 8:30 a.m. Sept. 27 at Volunteer Park. There\u2019s a new route this year, Bray said, but otherwise, the 5K continues its tradition of starting and ending at the park. Runners are asked to contribute $35, while walkers can join in for free. They encourage runners to ask friends and family to sponsor them, increasing their total donations.\n\nBray said this year\u2019s goal is $350,000, a number they fell just shy of last year.\n\nShare: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\nReddit\n\nEmail\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "CHS Capitol Hill Seattle", "description": "Lifelong is still on the Hill, and they want everyone to know about it.
