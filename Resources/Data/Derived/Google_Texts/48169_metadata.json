When counting finished, it had won 48 percent of the vote, the strongest result for a single party since New Zealand adopted a proportional election system in 1996, according to preliminary results from the national Electoral Commission. The commission estimated voter turnout at 77 percent, up from 74 percent in 2011.\n\n\u201cLadies and gentlemen, this is a victory for those who kept the faith,\u201d John Key, the prime minister and leader of the National Party, said in a televised speech at the party\u2019s election celebration in downtown Auckland. The jubilant audience responded with a chant of \u201cThree more years!\u201d\n\nThe result gives the National Party 61 of the 121 seats in Parliament, enough to govern alone, although Mr. Key said he would work on forming a coalition with the three smaller parties that are part of the existing coalition: ACT New Zealand, United Future and the Maori Party.\n\nMr. Key was greeted outside his Auckland home with a rousing haka, or Maori war dance, as he left for the celebration.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA short time earlier, the leader of the left-leaning opposition Labour Party, David Cunliffe, said he had already telephoned Mr. Key to concede defeat. But he insisted that he did not intend to resign, even though his party had won only 25 percent of the vote.\n\n\u201cIt will of course take the pundits some time to work through the entrails of this election,\u201d Mr. Cunliffe said in a televised speech to Labour Party supporters in the west Auckland suburb of New Lynn. \u201cOn the face of it, there\u2019s never been one like it: a campaign beset by dirty politics and sideshows, involving potential abuses of power at the highest level that will still take months and months to unravel. But New Zealanders have chosen to continue, and we respect that choice.\u201d\n\nHe was apparently referring to campaign scandals that led to the resignation of a senior minister and a member of Parliament.\n\nThe New Zealand electoral system allows two votes: one for a political party, and one for a candidate in a local election district. A party can enter Parliament by winning either an election district seat or at least 5 percent of the party vote.\n\nThe Internet Mana party \u2014 a political alliance that includes the Internet Party, founded and bankrolled by Kim Dotcom, the German entrepreneur accused of widespread Internet piracy \u2014 failed to win a seat in Parliament. Its main candidate, Hone Harawira, lost his local race, and Internet Mana\u2019s 1.26 percent of the party vote fell well short of the 5 percent needed.\n\nThe Internet Party leader, Laila Harr\u00e9, blamed the National Party for undermining Mr. Harawira\u2019s support, but Mr. Dotcom disagreed.\n\n\u201cI take full responsibility for this loss tonight, because the brand \u2014 the brand Kim Dotcom \u2014 was poison for what we were trying to achieve,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cI did not see that before, and it only became apparent to me in the last couple of weeks.\u201d Mr. Dotcom put at least $2.9 million into the Internet Party since May 26, according to Electoral Commission records.\n\nA co-leader of the Green Party, Russel Norman, said Mr. Dotcom\u2019s presence in the election had tarnished left-leaning parties like his. The Green Party won just 10 percent of the vote, down from 11 percent in 2011.\n\n\u201cI did say that to Kim Dotcom,\u201d he said. \u201cRemember, I did say a long time ago that it was a bad idea. But anyway, there you go.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140920123307, "twitter": {"description": "The party of Prime Minister John Key cruised to victory with a historic level of support, winning 48 percent of the vote.", "title": "New Zealand\u2019s Ruling National Party Is Re-elected", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/21/world/asia/new-zealands-ruling-national-party-is-re-elected.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003127930"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/21/world/asia/new-zealands-ruling-national-party-is-re-elected.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003127930", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/21/world/asia/new-zealands-ruling-national-party-is-re-elected.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "world/asia", "hdl_p": "New Zealand\u2019s Ruling National Party Is Re-elected", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/world/asia/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Sept. 20, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "Elections,Dotcom  Kim,Key  John P,New Zealand", "news_keywords": "Election", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Jonathan Hutchison", "SCG": "asia", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Key, John P", "byl": "By JONATHAN HUTCHISON", "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "The party of Prime Minister John Key cruised to victory with a historic level of support, winning 48 percent of the vote.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "description": "The party of Prime Minister John Key cruised to victory with a historic level of support, winning 48 percent of the vote.", "CG": "world", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Sept. 20, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"section": "Asia Pacific", "modified": "2014-09-24", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/world/asia/index.jsonp", "tag": "New Zealand", "published": "2014-09-20", "section-taxonomy-id": "9A43D8FC-F4CF-44D9-9B34-138D30468F8F"}, "geo": "New Zealand", "slug": "21newzealand", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140924121325, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/21/world/asia/new-zealands-ruling-national-party-is-re-elected.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article", "description": "The party of Prime Minister John Key cruised to victory with a historic level of support, winning 48 percent of the vote.", "title": "New Zealand\u2019s Ruling National Party Is Re-elected"}, "pdate": 20140920, "des": "Elections", "articleid": 100000003127930, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "New Zealand\u2019s Ruling National Party Is Re-elected", "PST": "News"}, "article_summary": "The Internet Party leader, Laila Harr\u00e9, blamed the National Party for undermining Mr. Harawira\u2019s support, but Mr. Dotcom disagreed.\nThe Green Party won just 10 percent of the vote, down from 11 percent in 2011.\nThe Internet Mana party \u2014 a political alliance that includes the Internet Party, founded and bankrolled by Kim Dotcom, the German entrepreneur accused of widespread Internet piracy \u2014 failed to win a seat in Parliament.\nAUCKLAND, New Zealand \u2014 The dominant center-right National Party was re-elected on Saturday to a third term in government with a historic level of support, despite an election campaign tainted by political scandals and resignations.\nA party can enter Parliament by winning either an election district seat or at least 5 percent of the party vote."}
