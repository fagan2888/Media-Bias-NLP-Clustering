The executive director of Hawaii’s state health care exchange announced her resignation on Friday amid delays in getting the insurance marketplace off the ground.

The director, Coral Andrews, who has led Hawaii Health Connector for two years as the state worked to build the exchange, will step down on Dec. 6. Tom Matsuda, the Affordable Care Act’s implementation manager in the governor’s office, will take over as interim director.

Ms. Andrews alluded to some of the problems the exchange has faced in a statement on Friday, but she did not explain why she was stepping away.

“This has been one of the most challenging but fulfilling roles that I’ve had in all my years in health care,” she said. “The Hawaii Health Connector has been my baby. It has required constant nurturing and attention. Although in many ways it is still growing and changing, the Connector has reached a point where I now need to let go and let someone else take charge.”

From its outset, Hawaii’s exchange has faced many of the same problems that have plagued the federal health care website and other state exchanges around the country.

Though the Hawaii Health Exchange website was supposed to be open on Oct. 1, software problems kept the site dark until Oct. 15. Ms Andrews publicly apologized for the delay last month.

As of Nov. 15, only 257 people had enrolled in health care programs through the state exchange.

Announcing the resignation, Sherry Menor-McNamara, chair of the exchange’s board, said Ms. Andrews had been “the driving force behind the Hawaii Health Connector.”

“Under her leadership, she took a concept and created a tangible product with a very compressed time period,” Ms. Menor-McNamara said in a statement. “Despite the inherent challenges of building a very complex system, Coral always reminded us why we were doing this. She was a tireless advocate determined to give the uninsured in Hawaii access to health care.”
