Last week, a spate of headlines made this point better than I could make it on my own.\n\nI was minding my business, mind you, surfing the Internet to check out the news and political sites and forums I customarily visit, and these news and column headlines, most from last week, some from a bit earlier and a few from this week, bombarded me.\n\nI wasn\u2019t looking for trouble. Nor was the satirical website The Onion one of the sites I visited. The world is upside down, inside out, sideways, crazy, nutso. Bad is good; up is down. Left is right; right is wrong. Evil is good; insanity is sanity. Abnormal is normal. Circles are squares. Hot is cold. Luke warm is red hot \u2014 among Republicans, anyway. Common sense is uncommon.\n\nThe world is otherworldly. Dissent is \u201chate.\u201d Diversity means conformity. The good guys are the bad guys; virtue is vice; sophistry is intellectualism; jerks are celebrated; debauchery is glorified; the holy is debauched. Let me share some of these headlines, which speak for themselves \u2014 loudly and depressingly.\n\n\u2013Shakespeare\u2019s Works \u2014 Too Hard, Too White.\n\n\u2013Obama Red-Faced: Iran Nuclear Stockpiles Grew 20 Percent in 18 months.\n\n\u2013Obamacare Dangerous to Our Health.\n\n\u2013Eye-Popping Premium Increases.\n\n\u2013Obama, Clinton Want To Enforce \u2018Correct\u2019 Thinking in America.\n\n\u2013High School Denies Pro-Life Club!\n\n\u2013Pentagon Officials Call Out Obama\u2019s \u2018Pathetic\u2019 ISIS Strategy.\n\n\u2013Shabazz Calls on Nation of Islam, New Black Panther \u2018Army\u2019 to Defend Black Communities Against Police Brutality.\n\n\u2013Obama: Climate Change Deniers Endangering National Security.\n\n\u2013Team Clinton Swarms Sunday Interview Shows, Minus Hillary.\n\n\u2013Antonin Scalia Is Unfit To Serve: A Justice Who Rejects Science and the Law for Religion Is of Unsound Mind.\n\n\u2013In L.A., Obama addresses Washington\u2019s Dysfunction: \u201cI Did Not Say I Would Fix It.\u201d\n\n\u2013Authorities: Gay Slur Carved Into Utah Man\u2019s Arm Was Staged.\n\n\u2013Justice Department: Transgender Students Can Use Bathrooms that Match Their Gender Identity.\n\n\u2013Political Correctness 101: Praising America, Virtues of Hard Work Dubbed \u2018Micro-Aggression\u2019 On Campuses.\n\n\u2013Video Shows U.S. Citizens Willing To Ban American Flag.\n\n\u2013Are Americans of Faith in Danger?\n\n\u2013Obama Administration Says Redskins Nickname Could Block Potential Stadium Deal.\n\n\u2013TV Land Drops \u201cDukes of Hazzard\u201d Amid Confederate Flag Controversy.\n\n\u2013Gay Teacher Files Federal Discrimination Lawsuit Against Catholic School.\n\n\u2013Terrific: Attorney in Charge of Releasing Lois Lerner \u2018Lost\u2019 Emails Now in Charge of HRC\u2019s Emails.\n\n\u2013For Obama, Rainbow White House Was \u2018A Moment Worth Savoring.\u2019\n\n\u2013Montana Polygamist Family Applies for Marriage License.\n\n\u201374 Children Executed by ISIS for \u2018Crimes\u2019 That Include Refusal To Fast, Report Says.\n\n\u2013New Undercover Footage Shows VA Officials Admitting of \u2018Unaccountability at Every Level.\u2019\n\n\u2013Black Teacher Hits Handicapped White Child, Tells Him Black People Fought To Not \u2018Serve White People Like You.\u2019\n\n\u2013Girl Scouts Raise $250K for Transgender Cause.\n\n\u2013Teen Leads Mob in Ransacking of Georgia Walmart.\n\n\u2013U.S. Debt Headed Toward Greek Levels.\n\n\u2013Obama Administration Invokes Executive Privilege on Benghazi Probe?\n\n\u2013United Church of Christ Anti-Israel Extremism.\n\n\u2013U.S. Troops in Afghanistan \u2018Feel Abandoned.\u2019\n\n\u2013More than 42 Million Muslims \u2018Support ISIS.\u2019\n\n\u201317 Shot Since Monday Morning in Baltimore.\n\n\u2013Baltimore Mayor Wants Park Named for Robert E.
