The answer is a qualified yes.\n\nWhile it\u2019s true that the Arizona Diamondbacks gave free-agent starter Zack Greinke a six-year contract worth $206.5 million, and the Chicago Cubs \u2014 as reported by numerous outlets \u2014 nabbed outfielder Jayson Heyward for $184 million over eight years, the Royals\u2019 more modest route to success has caught on.\n\nThe idea of building a strong relief corps with power arms that can take over a game in the sixth or seventh inning is certainly in vogue.\n\n\u201cI think you\u2019re seeing a trend toward that focus on bullpens,\u201d Rockies manager Walt Weiss said. \u201cI know that the years that we\u2019ve been good and we\u2019ve been playoff teams, we\u2019ve had good bullpens.\n\n\u201cGoing back to my days when I was (in Colorado) as a player in (1995), we had a real good bullpen. We figured: \u2018Come the sixth inning, we\u2019ll pass the ball around our bullpen, and our \u2018pen is going to beat yours.\u2019 \u201c\n\nThis is a good time to be a reliever.\n\nLast week the Rockies signed 33-year-old Jason Motte to a two-year contract worth $10 million and Chad Qualls, 37, for two years and $6 million.\n\nWithin the last 10 days, 11 relievers signed multiyear deals: Darren O\u2019Day, Joakim Soria, Ryan Madson, Tony Sipp, Shawn Kelley, Mark Lowe, John Axford, Jonathan Broxton, Oliver Perez, Motte and Qualls. The going rate for quality bullpen arms has been established at about $4 million to $8 million per season.\n\nMoney matters in K.C.\n\nThe Boston Red Sox, believing they can get back into contention in 2016, struck early to bolster their bullpen. Last month, they acquired four-time all-star closer Craig Kimbrel from the San Diego Padres in exchange for four prospects. Now Boston has a top-of-the-line finisher, with former Red Sox closer Koji Uehara pitching the eighth inning and Junichi Tazawa pitching the seventh. It\u2019s not on par with the Royals, but it\u2019s an upgrade for Boston.\n\nThe Royals\u2019 $113 million opening-day payroll ranked 17th in the majors in 2015, and that was downright generous by their historic standards. So general manager Dayton Moore knows he must spend wisely.\n\n\u201cThe bullpen has always been an area where money goes a little bit further,\u201d Moore said. \u201cSo you try to get impact there.\u201d\n\nThe Royals don\u2019t exactly play \u201csmall ball,\u201d but they certainly don\u2019t field a lineup of muscled sluggers. Moore emphasizes signing and developing athletic players with good contact skills and stresses the importance of putting the ball in play. In addition to finishing last in the majors in strikeouts in 2014 and 2015, the Royals also ranked last in walks in 2014 and second-to-last in 2015, ahead of only the lowly Miami Marlins.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t like to wait around,\u201d first baseman Eric Hosmer said during the World Series. \u201cWe feel that when a pitcher\u2019s ahead, he tries to make his pitches have more depth on them or put them in a spot to get us to chase. If we go up there with the approach that one of the first couple pitches you\u2019re going to get is probably going to be the best one to drive, and try to do some damage with it, I think that results in a lot less strikeouts.\u201d\n\nThe rest of baseball took notice.\n\n\u201c(Teams) do pay attention to what Kansas City did,\u201d Twins manager Paul Molitor said last week at the winter meetings. \u201cTwo years ago it was their bullpen philosophy and this year it was their offensive efficiency for not striking out and putting the ball in play.\u201d\n\n\u201cBest for our team\u201d\n\nThe Angels might have been influenced by Kansas City\u2019s bulletproof defense when they traded for brilliant Atlanta shortstop Andrelton Simmons. The cost was steep \u2014 veteran shortstop Erick Aybar and two legitimate starting-pitching prospects \u2014 but the Angels netted one of the best fielders in baseball.\n\nWhile the Royals have been praised for their economical approach to building a champion, they didn\u2019t set out to change the face of the game.\n\n\u201cTo be honest, we just do what we think is best for our team,\u201d Moore said.\n\nIn the process, the Royals created team chemistry that\u2019s proved to have staying power.\n\n\u201cI thought from the minute we lost the World Series last year \u2014 from the day that game was over \u2014 I thought this was a team that (could) win the World Series,\u201d manager Ned Yost said.\n\n\u201cFrom Day One, their energy, their intensity, their focus never wavered. I\u2019d never been on a team that\u2019s played 162 games where their energy never wavered for one instance throughout the entire year. So they were focused on what they wanted to accomplish. They knew what they wanted to accomplish.\u201d\n\nPatrick Saunders: psaunders@denverpost.com or @psaundersdp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Kansas City\u2019s blueprint to winning World Series now envied, copied by MLB teams", "title": "Kansas City\u2019s blueprint to winning World Series now envied, copied by MLB teams", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/12/12/kansas-citys-blueprint-to-winning-world-series-now-envied-copied-by-mlb-teams/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151212__f332716f40398e31860f6a706700ef38p1.jpg", "height": 468}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151212__f332716f40398e31860f6a706700ef38p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-12T14:26:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T19:46:17+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. \u2014 Here, in simplified terms, is the Kansas City Royals\u2019 blueprint to winning the World Series:\u2022 Build a fireproof bullpen.\n\u201cI thought from the minute we lost the World Series last year \u2014 from the day that game was over \u2014 I thought this was a team that (could) win the World Series,\u201d manager Ned Yost said.\n\u201cGoing back to my days when I was (in Colorado) as a player in (1995), we had a real good bullpen.\n\u201cTo be honest, we just do what we think is best for our team,\u201d Moore said.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t like to wait around,\u201d first baseman Eric Hosmer said during the World Series."}
