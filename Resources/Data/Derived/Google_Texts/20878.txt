Huh: With Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee promising to reject anyone Barack Obama nominates for the Supreme Court , the Washington Post reports that Obama is considering nominating Republican Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval . From the Post:

Sandoval was appointed to a federal judgeship in 2005 by George W. Bush after having been recommended for a job by Democratic Nevada Sen. Harry Reid. Elected governor in 2010, Sandoval is pro-choice; while he's not exactly pro-marriage equality or pro-Obamacare, as governor he abandoned the state of Nevada's legal efforts to enforce a same-sex marriage ban and has not opposed the implementation of the Affordable Care Act.
