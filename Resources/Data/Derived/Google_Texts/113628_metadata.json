The waivers give states more flexibility in how they operate their Medicaid programs. And they provide states with an avenue to test new approaches in Medicaid that differ from federal program rules, according to a brief by Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nWaivers have long been part of the Medicaid program, and states make changes to their individual programs all the time, said Robin Rudowitz, associate director of Kaiser\u2019s Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured.\n\n\u201cMany changes states can make without a waiver,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of flexibility within the current law. They move from fee-for-service to managed care. They change the delivery system, they add benefits.\u201d\n\nBut when a state wants to pursue something beyond the law, it has to ask the federal government\u2019s permission. And for a state to do that, it must create a proposal that includes justification for the changes and public input, Rudowitz said.\n\n\u201cThere is typically a lot of negotiation back and forth between the administration and states on what parameters they will approve,\u201d she said. \u201cIf it\u2019s approved, or whatever pieces are approved, will ultimately be part of a waiver approval document with very explicit, spelled-out standard terms and conditions.\u201d\n\nThe proposal also must be budget-neutral for the federal government.\n\nRudowitz said the time it takes to complete the process varies. But she said Kentucky could be in for a long wait, depending on what changes Bevin chooses to pursue.\n\n\u201cIf a state is making a change that\u2019s in line with what they can do under state law or under federal law, then they can make that change pretty seamlessly if it doesn\u2019t need legislative approval,\u201d she said.\n\nDemocratic Gov. Steve Beshear implemented Kynect \u2014 the exchange and the Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act \u2014 through executive order. It\u2019s possible that Republican Bevin could dismantle the law just the same.\n\nBut state Senate President Robert Stivers, also a Republican, said he hopes lawmakers won\u2019t be left out of the decision this time.\n\nRelated Story What May Happen If Obamacare Is Rolled Back in Kentucky\n\n\u201cThey did it without any legislation [when it was implemented],\u201d he said. \u201cThey did not come to the legislature to do this. So they felt that they had the authority three years ago with Gov. Beshear. Therefore, Governor-elect Bevin has the authority now.\u201d\n\nStivers said changes to Kentucky\u2019s health insurance exchange and Medicaid expansion program are necessary from a financial standpoint. By 2020, state government will spend an estimated $409 million a year to cover the required 10 percent cost of the expansion.\n\n\u201cWhat we want to do is create a different system that is not as costly, a system that has some personal responsibility,\u201d Stivers said.\n\nIndiana\u2019s Model\n\nKentucky could end up borrowing a page from a neighbor to the north.\n\nIndiana received a federal waiver for its Medicaid expansion program, HIP 2.0, earlier this year. The program is predicated on that state\u2019s existing Healthy Indiana Plan, which was already operating under a federal waiver.\n\nRudowitz said Indiana\u2019s program is the most complex out of all the states that have been approved for an federal Medicaid waiver.\n\nUnder HIP, coverage was expanded to Indiana parents and childless adults earning below 100 percent of the federal poverty level. Enrollment for parents was not capped, but enrollment for childless adults has a cap and is limited to open enrollment periods.\n\nThe amended waiver under the Affordable Care Act led to HIP 2.0 and covers nearly all adults ages 19-64 with income from zero to 138 percent of the federal poverty level \u2014 the same range as prescribed by the ACA. An estimated 350,000 individuals became eligible for coverage under this plan.\n\nBut unlike Kentucky\u2019s Medicaid expansion, most Hoosiers have to pay for their Medicaid coverage.\n\n\u201cIndiana does require a contribution for most of the newly eligible people in their program,\u201d Rudowitz said. \u201cThere\u2019s some different consequences for individuals below and above poverty.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Indiana Family and Social Services Administration, participants are required to pay premiums, which go into a \u201cPersonal Wellness and Responsibility\u201d account that acts like a health savings account. Participants are rewarded for using preventive care services.\n\nThere are also consequences for not paying premiums, such as mandatory co-pays for services and loss of coverage. HIP 2.0 includes a co-pay for emergency room use, designed to discourage routine use of the emergency room, which is a driver of higher health care costs.\n\nThe plan also offers low-income Hoosiers an option to obtain assistance in purchasing private insurance through their employers, called HIP Link.\n\nRudowitz said there isn\u2019t specific data on Indiana\u2019s program yet, but there is a large body of research examining the effect of premiums and cost-sharing on low-income populations.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of evidence that imposing out-of-pocket requirements for a low-income population does have implications for both participation and access to care,\u201d she said.\n\nStivers said Kentucky\u2019s health care system has to be one that everybody takes part in and takes responsibility for.\n\n\u201cI want to see a good health care model that is the right model, that requires people to do for themselves, and when they can\u2019t the government can help them,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Governor-elect Matt Bevin has plans to scale back Kentucky's Medicaid expansion, but he'll need federal approval to do it.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "89.3 WFPL", "description": "Governor-elect Matt Bevin has plans to scale back Kentucky's Medicaid expansion, but he'll need federal approval to do it.", "title": "Long Process For Bevin to Roll Back Medicaid in Kentucky", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://wfpl.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/J1C4036edit-e1461801615542.jpg", "height": 772}, "updated_time": "2015-11-16T11:07:01-04:00", "url": "http://wfpl.org/changes-kentuckys-medicaid-expansion-look-like/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Governor-elect Matt Bevin has plans to scale back Kentucky's Medicaid expansion, but he'll need federal approval to do it.", "creator": "@JaNelSJohnson", "image": "http://wfpl.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/J1C4036edit-e1461801615542.jpg", "title": "Long Process For Bevin to Roll Back Medicaid in Kentucky", "site": "@WFPLNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100006229511236, "pages": 33077174555, "app_id": 1539400482939529}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wfpllouisville", "section": "Health", "tag": "affordable care act", "published_time": "2015-11-12T10:55:20-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-16T11:07:01-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Bevin has said he intends to apply for a Section 1115 Medicaid waiver from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\nWaivers have long been part of the Medicaid program, and states make changes to their individual programs all the time, said Robin Rudowitz, associate director of Kaiser\u2019s Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured.\nStivers said Kentucky\u2019s health care system has to be one that everybody takes part in and takes responsibility for.\nIndiana received a federal waiver for its Medicaid expansion program, HIP 2.0, earlier this year.\nRudowitz said Indiana\u2019s program is the most complex out of all the states that have been approved for an federal Medicaid waiver."}
