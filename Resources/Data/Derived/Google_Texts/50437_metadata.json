But how much data do people really need\u2014or even want\u2014about their bodies\u2019 day-to-day behaviors?\n\nThe Wello case, a hard shell made of polycarbonate plastic, will have sensors clustered around four hotspots on the surface of the phone to take readings from your hands.\n\n\u201cWe want it to be very simple so you can see how your body is doing any given day,\u201d said Hamish Patel, founder of Azoi, the maker of Wello. \u201cPress on the sensors, open the app and you see your vitals.\u201d\n\nWhat they don\u2019t tell you in the press release: The $199 Wello case likely won\u2019t be available for iPhone and Android phones until at least the fall because it is still waiting for FDA approval. (That process alone could take 90 days or more.) The case will be manufactured in Texas but sold globally, so the data consumers will see will depend on health regulations in their country.\n\nHow accurate will the readings be? The data from the cellphone case will be on par with devices already approved by the FDA such as pulse oximeters, says Patel.\n\nWello is the latest entrant to the consumer personal health tracking device market that has seen the rise of wristband and clip-on health trackers such as Fitbit, Jawbone Up and Nike+ FuelBand. To start with, Wello will just integrate with Fitbit so users can see Wello data layered on top of their Fitbit stats.\n\nBut unlike with activity trackers, health monitors such as Wello could quickly become boring. Most healthy individuals are unlikely to see a change in their heart rate, blood pressure or temperature from day-to-day. Regular vital signs as displayed by the Wello could soon seem monotonous\u2014that\u2019s good news for one\u2019s health but bad for anyone looking to stay interested.\n\n\u201cWe are working to get the stickiness factor,\u201d says Patel.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "A cellphone case promises to spit out a quick read of your blood pressure, heart rate, blood oxygen, temperature and lung function.
