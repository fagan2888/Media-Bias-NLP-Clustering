How could Clinton be so flip about the self-proclaimed caliphate as it sparks mayhem from Syria to San Bernardino?\n\nHere\u2019s the full context of what Clinton said, parrying Sanders\u2019 proposal to fight ISIS now and worry about Syria President Bashar al-Assad later:\n\nClinton: \u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say, Assad has killed, by last count, about 250,000 Syrians. The reason we are in the mess we\u2019re in, that ISIS has the territory it has, is because of Assad. \u201cI advocated arming the moderate opposition back in the day when I was still secretary of state, because I worried we would end up exactly where we are now. \u201cAnd so, when we look at these complex problems, I wish it could be either/or. I wish we could say yes, let\u2019s go destroy ISIS and let\u2019s let Assad continue to destroy Syria, which creates more terrorists, more extremists by the minute. \u201cNo. We now finally are where we need to be. We have a strategy and a commitment to go after ISIS, which is a danger to us as well as the region. Sanders, interrupting: \u201cSecretary.\u201d Clinton, resuming: \u201cAnd we finally have a U.N. Security Council Resolution bringing the world together to go after a political transition in Syria.\u201c\n\nSo Clinton\u2019s comment about \u201cwhere we need to be\u201d is followed immediately by \u201cstrategy,\u201d not about implementing it on the battlefield. Then she mentions this week\u2019s Security Council resolution.\n\nClinton campaign chief John Podesta called criticism of the remark \u201ctotally out of context,\u201d saying:\n\n\u201cShe wasn\u2019t saying that about ISIS. She was saying that specifically about the U.N. Security Council resolution that passed yesterday to get on a political track to get a political resolution to get Assad out of the government and to move forward with a solution.\u201d\n\nThe Sanders campaign was not eager to harp on it, but did not come rushing to Clinton\u2019s defense either. When we asked about the remark, Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver replied: \u201cPeople have to make their own judgment about that.\u201d\n\nThe Republicans, though, see an opportunity. As soon as the debate ended, a quote from Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus landed in reporters\u2019 inboxes, saying in part:\n\n\u201cClinton\u2019s assertion that we are \u2018where we need to be\u2019 on ISIS in the wake of the San Bernardino and Paris attacks shows a complete disconnect with reality and is completely out-of-touch with the American people.\u201d\n\nExpect Republicans not to drop this one, and to see it in a lot more places, stripped of context. It could one day join the pantheon with Clinton\u2019s famous remark about Benghazi, in discussing the motivations of the killers: \u201cWhat difference, at this point, does it make?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Political Insider blog", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://politics.blog.ajc.com/2015/12/20/parsing-hillary-clintons-we-now-finally-are-where-we-need-to-be-comment-on-isis/", "image": "https://cmgajcpolitics.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/nh-debate-2.jpg?w=640", "type": "article", "description": "MANCHESTER, N.H. --\u00a0In the age of Twitter, the spin room happens during the debate, and a Hillary Clinton line Saturday night about the Islamic State picked up immediate attention.\r\n\r\nhttps://twitter.com/JebBush/status/678404306693820416\r\n\r\nDuring one of ABC's strange mid-debate breaks, George Stephanopoulos and company\u00a0brought the line\u00a0up, too.
