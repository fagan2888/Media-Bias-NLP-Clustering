The Colorado State Rams, who had rotating game captains for their regular-season games, have selected five season captains.

The choices were four seniors — linebackers Aaron Davis and Max Morgan, quarterback Garrett Grayson and Ty Sambrailo. They were joined by junior safety Trent Matthews.

“Those young men have bled green for us and it’s a special honor to announce them as the captains for the 2014 season and for the bowl game,” said interim coach Dave Baldwin.

The Rams will find out their bowl destination Sunday. I’m not going to say where it is, but let’s just put it this way: Most likely for Rams fans, what happens in the bowl site, stays in the bowl site.
