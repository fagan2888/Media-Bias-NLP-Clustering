The 9th Circuit overturned a lower court that had said the rules were unconstitutional.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court last year allowed closely held corporations to seek exemptions from the Obamacare health law\u2019s contraception requirement.\n\nIn Washington, the state permits a religiously objecting individual pharmacist to deny medicine, so long as another pharmacist working there provides timely delivery. The rules require a pharmacy to deliver all medicine, even if the owner objects.\n\nA unanimous three-judge 9th Circuit panel on Thursday decided that the rules are constitutional because they rationally further the state\u2019s interest in patient safety. Speed is particularly important considering the time-sensitive nature of emergency contraception, the court said.\n\n\u201cThe time taken to travel to another pharmacy, especially in rural areas where pharmacies are sparse, may reduce the efficacy of those drugs,\u201d wrote Judge Susan Graber.\n\nRepresentatives for the plaintiffs and Washington State\u2019s attorney general office could not immediately be reached for comment.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Pharmacist-preparing-some-medicine-Shutterstock-800x430.jpg", "height": 430}, "title": "Federal appeals court says pharmacy owners cannot use religion to deny medicine"}, "fb": {"app_id": 212555972273585}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "article_summary": "Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco, came in a case filed by pharmacists who objected to delivering emergency contraceptives.\nRepresentatives for the plaintiffs and Washington State\u2019s attorney general office could not immediately be reached for comment.\nThe rules require a pharmacy to deliver all medicine, even if the owner objects.\nThe 9th Circuit overturned a lower court that had said the rules were unconstitutional.\nIn Washington, the state permits a religiously objecting individual pharmacist to deny medicine, so long as another pharmacist working there provides timely delivery."}
