Only then could the president move ahead with his plan to welcome 10,000 refugees in the coming year.\n\nThe White House announced Wednesday it would veto the bill because the proposed requirements \u201cwould provide no meaningful additional security\u201d for the country.\n\nRepublicans have used the Paris attacks and the resulting refugee debate to heap fresh criticism on the president\u2019s efforts to defeat ISIS, saying he lacks a concrete plan to destroy the group. The barbs have apparently gotten to Obama; during news conferences in Turkey and the Philippines this week the president seemed to be irritated by questions about his ISIS strategy.\n\nRelated: Lindsey Graham Wants to Declare War on ISIS, but Is Anyone Listening?\n\nRepublicans, some of whom threatened to take Obama to court if he closed Guantanamo unilaterally, now see the delay as another opportunity to keep the president on his heels.\n\nIn a statement, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) said, \u201cfrankly there should have never been such a plan in the first place.\u201d\n\nHe and others highlighted congressional testimony from earlier this week by Attorney General Loretta Lynch which implied that transferring Guantanamo detainees to the U.S. would break the law, such as the recently passed defense policy bill which contains a provision barring such actions.\n\n\u201cThe administration\u2019s time would be better spent on a plan to defeat ISIS than on one to move terrorist detainees to our homeland. This delay should be permanent,\u201d according to Ryan.\n\n\"Once again, the president has been forced to confront the hard reality of Islamic terrorism and admit that closing the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay isn't as easy as it sounds on the campaign trail,\u201d said House armed services committee chair Mac Thornberry (R-TX). \u201cGoing back to the drawing board on a vague, ill considered 'plan' is a good start.\u201d\n\nRelated: Jeb Bush: We Need U.S. Ground Troops to Fight ISIS\n\nSpeaking on the Senate floor Thursday morning, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) said, \u201cthe reality of closing the secure detention facility is a lot harder than making promises on the campaign trail,\u201d a reference to a pledge Obama made during the 2008 presidential race.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an incredibly complex issue with grave national security concerns for the citizens of our country and our allies. That fact that the president has never been able to present any kind of serious plan to Congress seems to say a lot,\u201d he said, adding lawmakers \u201cwill of course keep an open mind\u201d if and when the strategy is delivered.\n\nOn Wednesday, the attorneys general of Colorado, Kansas and South Carolina \u2013 three states the Pentagon has scoured for alternative detention facilities \u2013 sent a letter to the president that cited the Paris attacks and urged him not to use executive action to send inmates to their states, claiming it would \u201cviolate federal law.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, the Pentagon announced it was transferring five Yemeni detainees to the United Arab Emirates, bringing the prison population down to 107 \u2013 a far cry from the 800 inmates it once held. Of those remaining, 48 have been approved for transfers.\n\nRegardless of when the president\u2019s plan is delivered, with only 14 months left in Obama\u2019s term the administration will likely push to send those 48 to other countries faster. Doing so would raise the cost per-prisoner of those remaining and reinforce the White House\u2019s long-standing argument that the detention site is an expensive drain on U.S. national security.\n\nThe prison has cost the American taxpayers nearly $5 billion since it opened in 2002, according to the American Civil Liberties Union, and each detainee costs taxpayers millions annually.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The White House has decided to delay releasing its plan to shutter the U.S. detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, dealing the Obama administration another political setback in a week that has been rife with them.", "title": "Obama Stumbles Again on Gitmo Closure Plan", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/19/Obama-Stumbles-Again-Gitmo-Closure-Plan", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/05022013_Guantanamo_Prisoner_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/19/Obama-Stumbles-Again-Gitmo-Closure-Plan", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/05022013_Guantanamo_Prisoner_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The White House has decided to delay releasing its plan to shutter the U.S. detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, dealing the Obama administration another political setback in a week that has been rife with them.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd29a3\"", "article_summary": "The White House announced Wednesday it would veto the bill because the proposed requirements \u201cwould provide no meaningful additional security\u201d for the country.\nOnly then could the president move ahead with his plan to welcome 10,000 refugees in the coming year.\n\u201cThe administration\u2019s time would be better spent on a plan to defeat ISIS than on one to move terrorist detainees to our homeland.\n\u201cGoing back to the drawing board on a vague, ill considered 'plan' is a good start.\u201dRelated: Jeb Bush: We Need U.S.\nThe White House has decided to delay releasing its plan to close the U.S. detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, dealing the Obama administration another political setback in a week that has been rife with them."}
