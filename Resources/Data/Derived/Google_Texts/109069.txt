Davis' book will likely draw attention from both supporters and critics. Davis memoir set for September

Wendy Davis’ forthcoming memoir is one step closer to its debut: “Forgetting to Be Afraid” will be released Sept. 2, about two months before Davis faces the Lone Star State’s voters in the gubernatorial race, the publisher said Tuesday.

The book will likely draw intense attention from supporters and critics of Davis, who frequently talks on the trail about her rise from single motherhood to Harvard Law to the Texas legislature and has come under fire for disputed details in the story. Blue Rider Press described the book as “deeply personal” in a post on its website.

The publisher announced plans for the book in November, after Davis joined the gubernatorial race against Republican Greg Abbott, the state attorney general, following a nationally watched filibuster against an abortion bill in the Texas state Senate. Abbott is the race’s favorite in the solidly Republican state.

The Texas Tribune reported on the book’s new details earlier Tuesday. Davis campaign spokesman Zac Petkanas confirmed the title, and Blue Rider Press spokeswoman Aileen Boyle confirmed the release date.
