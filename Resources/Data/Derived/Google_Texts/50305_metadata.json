Richard Cowling III, Ph.D., R.N., vice president of academic affairs at Chamberlain College of Nursing.\n\nIn 2010, the Institute of Medicine released a trailblazing report calling for 80 percent of the nursing workforce to be BSN-educated by 2020. The ambitious goal was grounded in evidence that higher education equips nurses to be more effective caregivers and navigators in the increasingly complex healthcare system, according to an article from American Nurse Today.\n\nEducation does play a critical role in shaping aspiring nurses as informed, effective caregivers.
