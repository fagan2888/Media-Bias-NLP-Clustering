(CLEVELAND) - Nelson Mandela's name will live through history as one of the world's greatest leaders. He rose to power when he was most needed by a population forced to live as a second-class people. Indeed, he taught us many lessons about life and death and the need to remain strong when faced with an inflexible system created by human beings who truly viewed their existence as more important, more valuable. There truly is not enough space to list the accomplishments of this iconic man who gave people hope and liberty. His legend and sacrifice will endure, while systems like apartheid in the end will crumble. The world is still fighting racism the same way it always has, but under Nelson Mandela things improved, and we were inspired to see change. His legacy must continue to form and shape the thinking in this world, where groups are so often branded as "terrorists" simply because they resists a system of dominant racism. Mandela refused to lay down arms and because of this the people of South Africa achieved an impossible dream. - Tim King “ Nelson Mandela “Greatness Doesn’t Go On Sale!” Icon! “Many are called but few are chosen” an Icon by name,

Icon is fleeting because it is used so freely as in sports games,

Leaders are cultivated and nourished deep, deep in the valley,

A Chef becomes world renowned w/o struggling in the galley?



The world recounts his life and times as an Opera at the Met,

This is a production that’s years in the making lest any forget,

2 life times to accomplish a mission not by a roll of the dice,

As Moses spent 40 years in the wilderness and he did it twice.



“Mandela stood up against a great injustice, paying a huge price,”

Rick Santorum, but he says the answer wasn’t necessarily right,

When an Iconic leader passes upon their death Idiots will arise,

Equating Obamacare a similar struggle controlling peoples lives.



Racism President Mandela fought against cannot be compared,

To injustice in America where Germany & Russia might be fair,

Adolph Hitler, Valdimir Lenin, Joseph Stalin, oh yeah Idi Amin,

Taking an unjust extended prison term for Nelson’s fame to begin.



Rolihlahla Mandela, Mveao, Union of South Africa, 18th of July,

1994-1999 President of South Africa, 12/5/15 @95, he would die,

Many express remorse & sadness at his passing, question is why?

He dismantled the legacy of Apartheid setting his standards high.



Taking on institutionalized racism, poverty, inequality and the like,

1st by a fully representative election to hold office in what was right,

Served as ANC President 1991-1997, Secretary General 1998-1999,

He has accomplished more in 95 years than billions in their lifetime.



There is not enough room or time to list his accomplishments here,

However, they must be many because the world holds him so dear,

For 1 man to garner such global affection from nations free and not,

Can only recall the passing of, “Lady Di” when time seemed too stop.



Sadness? Certainly not, thanks to the legacy few have ever seen before,

President Abraham Lincoln can lay claim to walking through that door,

I’d say no need not take off your shoes let alone count the second hand,

In the modern world could we name more who have taken such a stand?



No! The world should not mourn we should gather together and rejoice,

“Give me liberity or give me death” like Patrick Henry made the choice,

Abraham waited 25 years for the promise, Nelson spent 27 years in jail,

Icons are Icons because they endure, “Greatness Doesn’t Go On Sale!”

Another former U.S. Marine, Luke heals the world with an approach that reaches people on a different level, one known for centuries, yet too often forgotten in the one we live in. We live in a world of social & economic injustice. The main reason for founding America in the first place was to relieve the oppression of the King of England. Patrick Henry said it best, “give me liberty or give me death.” And yet, all too often death seems to be the only way out. Why is there such a high suicide rate especially among teens, in the land of the free & the home of the brave? What makes headlines? Good news? Ha! More depressing stories than anything else. I feel poetry takes an edge off the hurt of bad news while still delivering it but in a, “glitzy” sort of way. Giving a different perspective. Kind of like slap in the face as opposed to a knife in the back. At least with the slap you’ll live to see another day and you will know whom it’s from. I wasn’t here for the beginning of the world but at 59, I just might be here for the end. Even though it’s still a knife, rhyme poetry helps to dull the blade. And that’s my job.
