It would blast the creaking vessel\u2019s hull well below the waterline and possibly flood the engine room. And for this, a recent survey reveals, Americans of all stripes would cheer wildly.\n\nRepublicans must sink the Obamacare bailout. Believe it or not, Obamacare forces taxpayers to help health-insurance companies absorb significant losses that they incur through Obama\u2019s medical scheme. According to the House Government Oversight Committee, this could cost $1 billion this year alone. This outrage \u2014 lodged on page 233 of the original 2,409-page Obamacare bill \u2014 would be awful enough if these insurers were prosperous, albeit unwitting, victims of Obama\u2019s $2.6 trillion entitlement. Instead, insurance companies helped pile-drive Obamacare down the throats of Americans, a majority of whom opposed this legislation and loathe it more today than yesterday. Hard data now demonstrate that Americans hate the Obamacare bailout \u2014 all across the political spectrum.\n\nMcLaughlin & Associates surveyed 1,000 likely voters last June. It asked a simple, straightforward question:\n\n\u201cIf private insurance companies lose money selling health insurance under Obamacare, should taxpayers help cover their losses?\u201d\n\nThe reaction was volcanic.\n\nMcLaughlin found that 81.2 percent of respondents said \u201cNo\u201d to this concept, while only 9.9 percent approved. Another 8.9 percent were not sure what to think.\n\nThis idea is universally despised, even without garnishing it with a red-meat phrase like \u201cthe Obamacare Bailout.\u201d McLaughlin\u2019s gently posed question yields widespread revulsion.\n\nSingle women hate this concept. Liberals hate it. Obama voters hate it. If the Obamacare bailout wants a friend, it should buy a dog.\n\nConsider the huge percentages by which these often left-of-center population segments just say \u201cNo!\u201d to the Obamacare bailout:\n\nStudents: 67.6\n\nBlacks: 69.2\n\nHispanics: 72.7\n\n18- to 29-year-olds: 75.0\n\nWomen: 79.3\n\nDemocrats: 75.7\n\nGovernment workers: 82.4\n\nIndependents: 83.2\n\nEven among self-identified \u201cvery liberal\u201d respondents, 22 percent back the Obamacare bailout, but 68.6 percent disapprove.\n\nThose least disgusted with the Obamacare bailout are, oddly enough, self-described liberal Republicans. They may be more pro\u2013big business than pro\u2013free enterprise. As such, some of them may smile as the federal government vacuums hard-earned tax dollars from the wallets of regular workers and pumps them into the vaults of multi-billion-dollar, pro-government corporations. But even here, only 30.7 percent of these RINOs applaud Obamacare\u2019s exercise in cronyism. Another 66.9 percent disapprove. So, the Obamacare bailout loses badly among the Nelson Rockefeller\u2013George Elmer Pataki crowd.\n\nThis datum may be the most encouraging to Obamacare\u2019s foes: Among those very likely to vote in the November 4 midterm elections, 82 percent reject the Obamacare bailout.\n\nWith a margin of error of just plus or minus 3.1 percent, McLaughlin\u2019s survey is solid. Also, the groups mentioned above include more than 30 respondents each. Thus, they are statistically significant and reflect the broader subpopulations that McLaughlin sampled. Behind these figures stand millions of Americans who would be thrilled to be rid of this mess.\n\nAs Republicans and free-marketeers work to junk the Obamacare bailout, they should not babble in Washingtonese. They should avoid debating whether or not Section 1342 of the Affordable Care Act is revenue-neutral as the result of reinsurance contributions collected by the U.S. Treasury across multiple fiscal years.\n\nZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.\n\nThis program officially is called \u201cRisk Corridor.\u201d This is baffling, yet strangely intriguing. (\u201cComing soon: Risk Corridor, starring Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman. Directed by the Master of Suspense, Alfred Hitchcock.\u201d)\n\nJust call it \u201cthe Obamacare bailout.\u201d This phrase should turn an idea opposed by 81.2 percent of the public into something even more toxic. Support likely will fall to 5 percent or lower, and the numbers of undecided respondents will crater, too. If likely voters oppose \u201cthe Obamacare bailout\u201d by 90 percent \u2014 with 5 percent in favor and 5 percent still clueless \u2014 congressional Republicans will have no excuse for not drowning this rotten sliver of this wretched law.\n\n\u201cWith Obamacare\u2019s costs rising and projected to cost more than $2 trillion over the next decade, and its damage on people\u2019s jobs and work hours continuing,\u201d Senator Marco Rubio (R., Fla.) recently wrote, \u201cit\u2019s clear this law has failed. It\u2019s time to repeal and replace it, but at the very least, we should make it the law of the land that health insurers won\u2019t be bailed out by taxpayers because ObamaCare has not proven to be as profitable as its proponents hoped it would be.\u201d\n\nTo his great credit, Senator Rubio has sponsored legislation to stop the Obamacare bailout, as has Representative Leonard Lance (R., N.J.). Rubio and Lance aim to scuttle the vile mechanism \u2014 scheduled for 2014, \u201915, and \u201916 \u2014 whereby a health insurer would declare an expected profit target; if losses exceed that benchmark by 3 to 8 percent, federal taxpayers would reimburse 50 percent of that shortfall. If an insurer\u2019s costs outpace his revenue target by more than 8 percent, hardworking American taxpayers would mop up 80 percent of that red ink.\n\nIf Democrats try to justify all of this, the specifics will enrage Americans even further. Jeffrey H. Anderson, executive director of the 2017 Project, which commissioned the McLaughlin survey, cannot wait to see vulnerable incumbent legislators such as Mark Begich of Alaska, Kay Hagan of North Carolina, Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, and Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire try to defend this massive giveaway.\n\n\u201cI think the key is to have House Republicans vote to end the bailout,\u201d Anderson tells me. \u201cAnd then, pro-Obamacare Democrats can explain why they want to use tax dollars to bail out their insurance-company allies. That should make Obamacare all the more popular.\u201d\n\nRepresentative Tom Cotton (R., Ark.) already has slammed his U.S. Senate opponent for backing this boondoggle. \u201cSenator Mark Pryor thought it was a good idea to bail out Wall Street and Detroit, as well as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac,\u201d Cotton remarked. \u201cSo we shouldn\u2019t be surprised that he thinks Arkansas taxpayers should help foot the bill when big insurance companies lose money selling Obamacare insurance.\u201d\n\nThe GOP House would be wise to attach the Rubio\u2013Lance language as a solitary amendment to must-pass appropriations bills. This would make it tough for Senate Democrat leader Harry Reid of Nevada to bury the anti-bailout measure in a shallow grave, as he already has interred some 347 House-passed bills, just since January. To borrow a phrase from writer Andy Wickersham, this will make life rough for Democrats in Republican Territory (DIRT).\n\nRubio calls the Obamacare bailout \u201cgovernment favoritism and corporate cronyism at its worst.\u201d Rubio is absolutely right. Voting to kill the Obamacare bailout would give Republicans a rare opportunity to throw big business overboard. The GOP has no business being the party of corporate welfare. This time, let \u201cpro\u2013little guy\u201d Democrats stick up for these huge, whoring companies.\n\nOnce insurers see the safety net being removed from beneath them, they might stop their high-wire waltz with Obama. If health-insurance companies actually face the full losses they deserve for their wicked dance with Obama, they might find it far less pleasant to embrace him cheek-to-cheek. If that unbribes these CEOs, sours them on Obamacare, and turns some of them into full-throated opponents of this hideous new law, so much the better. Without the support of Big Insurance and, more so, with their criticism, it will be that much harder for Obama to sustain his signature \u201caccomplishment.\u201d\n\nMr. Speaker, I call for the yeas and nays!\n\n(For more details on McLaughlin\u2019s survey, please click here and see below.)\n\n\u2014 Deroy Murdock is a New York\u2013based Fox News contributor and a media fellow with the Hoover Institution on War, Revolution, and Peace at Stanford University.", "article_metadata": {"tweettext": "Sink the Obamacare Bailout", "sailthru.author": "Deroy Murdock", "description": "When Congress reconvenes on Monday, September 8, Republicans should fire a torpedo directly into the USS Obamacare.

If the Obamacare bailout wants a friend, it should buy a dog.\n\nConsider the huge percentages by which these often left-of-center population segments just say \u201cNo!\u201d to the Obamacare bailout:\n\nStudents: 67.6\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nBlacks: 69.2\n\nHispanics: 72.7\n\n18- to 29-year-olds: 75.0\n\nWomen: 79.3\n\nDemocrats: 75.7\n\nGovernment workers: 82.4\n\nIndependents: 83.2\n\nEven among self-identified \u201cvery liberal\u201d respondents, 22 percent back the Obamacare bailout, but 68.6 percent disapprove.\n\nThose least disgusted with the Obamacare bailout are, oddly enough, self-described liberal Republicans. They may be more pro\u2013big business than pro\u2013free enterprise. As such, some of them may smile as the federal government vacuums hard-earned tax dollars from the wallets of regular workers and pumps them into the vaults of multi-billion-dollar, pro-government corporations. But even here, only 30.7 percent of these RINOs applaud Obamacare\u2019s exercise in cronyism. Another 66.9 percent disapprove. So, the Obamacare bailout loses badly among the Nelson Rockefeller\u2013George Elmer Pataki crowd.\n\nThis datum may be the most encouraging to Obamacare\u2019s foes: Among those very likely to vote in the November 4 midterm elections, 82 percent reject the Obamacare bailout.\n\nWith a margin of error of just plus or minus 3.1 percent, McLaughlin\u2019s survey is solid. Also, the groups mentioned above include more than 30 respondents each. Thus, they are statistically significant and reflect the broader subpopulations that McLaughlin sampled. Behind these figures stand millions of Americans who would be thrilled to be rid of this mess.\n\nAs Republicans and free-marketeers work to junk the Obamacare bailout, they should not babble in Washingtonese. They should avoid debating whether or not Section 1342 of the Affordable Care Act is revenue-neutral as the result of reinsurance contributions collected by the U.S. Treasury across multiple fiscal years.\n\nZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.\n\nThis program officially is called \u201cRisk Corridor.\u201d This is baffling, yet strangely intriguing. (\u201cComing soon: Risk Corridor, starring Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman. Directed by the Master of Suspense, Alfred Hitchcock.\u201d)\n\nJust call it \u201cthe Obamacare bailout.\u201d This phrase should turn an idea opposed by 81.2 percent of the public into something even more toxic. Support likely will fall to 5 percent or lower, and the numbers of undecided respondents will crater, too. If likely voters\u00a0oppose \u201cthe Obamacare bailout\u201d by 90 percent \u2014 with 5 percent in favor and 5 percent still clueless \u2014 congressional Republicans will have no excuse for not drowning this rotten sliver of this wretched law.\n\n#page#\u201cWith Obamacare\u2019s costs rising and projected to cost more than $2 trillion over the next decade, and its damage on people\u2019s jobs and work hours continuing,\u201d Senator Marco Rubio (R., Fla.) recently wrote, \u201cit\u2019s clear this law has failed. It\u2019s time to repeal and replace it, but at the very least, we should make it the law of the land that health insurers won\u2019t be bailed out by taxpayers because ObamaCare has not proven to be as profitable as its proponents hoped it would be.\u201d\n\nTo his great credit, Senator Rubio has sponsored legislation to stop the Obamacare bailout, as has Representative Leonard Lance (R., N.J.). Rubio and Lance aim to scuttle the vile mechanism \u2014 scheduled for 2014, \u201915, and \u201916 \u2014 whereby a health insurer would declare an expected profit target; if losses exceed that benchmark by 3 to 8 percent, federal taxpayers would reimburse 50 percent of that shortfall. If an insurer\u2019s costs outpace his revenue target by more than 8 percent, hardworking American taxpayers would mop up 80 percent of that red ink.\n\n#ad#If Democrats try to justify all of this, the specifics will enrage Americans even further. Jeffrey H. Anderson, executive director of the 2017 Project, which commissioned the McLaughlin survey, cannot wait to see vulnerable incumbent legislators such as Mark Begich of Alaska, Kay Hagan of North Carolina, Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, and Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire try to defend this massive giveaway.\n\n\u201cI think the key is to have House Republicans vote to end the bailout,\u201d Anderson tells me. \u201cAnd then, pro-Obamacare Democrats can explain why they want to use tax dollars to bail out their insurance-company allies. That should make Obamacare all the more popular.\u201d\n\nRepresentative Tom Cotton (R., Ark.) already has slammed his U.S. Senate opponent for backing this boondoggle. \u201cSenator Mark Pryor thought it was a good idea to bail out Wall Street and Detroit, as well as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac,\u201d\u00a0Cotton remarked.\u00a0\u201cSo we shouldn\u2019t be surprised that he thinks Arkansas taxpayers should help foot the bill when big insurance companies lose money selling Obamacare insurance.\u201d\n\nThe GOP House would be wise to attach the Rubio\u2013Lance language as a solitary amendment to must-pass appropriations bills. This would make it tough for Senate Democrat leader Harry Reid of Nevada to bury the anti-bailout measure in a shallow grave, as he already has interred some 347 House-passed bills, just since January. To borrow a phrase from writer Andy Wickersham, this will make life rough for Democrats in Republican Territory (DIRT).\n\nRubio calls the Obamacare bailout \u201cgovernment favoritism and corporate cronyism at its worst.\u201d \u00a0Rubio is absolutely right. Voting to kill the Obamacare bailout would give Republicans a rare opportunity to throw big business overboard. The GOP has no business being the party of corporate welfare. This time, let \u201cpro\u2013little guy\u201d Democrats stick up for these huge, whoring companies.\u00a0\n\nOnce insurers see the safety net being removed from beneath them, they might stop their high-wire waltz with Obama. If health-insurance companies actually face the full losses they deserve for their wicked dance with Obama, they might find it far less pleasant to embrace him cheek-to-cheek. If that unbribes these CEOs, sours them on Obamacare, and turns some of them into full-throated opponents of this hideous new law, so much the better. Without the support of Big Insurance and, more so, with their criticism, it will be that much harder for Obama to sustain his signature \u201caccomplishment.\u201d\n\nMr. Speaker, I call for the yeas and nays!\n\n(For more details on McLaughlin\u2019s survey, please click here and see below.)\n\n\n\n\u2014 Deroy Murdock is a New York\u2013based Fox News contributor and a media fellow with the Hoover Institution on War, Revolution, and Peace at Stanford University.", "card": "summary", "title": "Sink the Obamacare Bailout, by Deroy Murdock, National Review"}, "sailthru.date": "Wed, 2014-08-27 16:00", "robots": "follow, index", "sailthru.title": "Sink the Obamacare Bailout", "keywords": "Deroy Murdock", "fb": {"app_id": 129250807108374}, "sailthru.tags": "Sink the Obamacare Bailout, Deroy Murdock, National Review", "msvalidate.01": "E48498F585100158A880ED1615918208", "google-site-verification": "OOtPjyj3i8ggfSXzZ7MPoTiwFy_JnfzKMPkjZ5bhpk0", "copyright": "\u00a9 National Review, Inc.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Deroy Murdock, Politics, Nation, World"}, "article_summary": "This idea is universally despised, even without garnishing it with a red-meat phrase like \u201cthe Obamacare Bailout.\u201d McLaughlin\u2019s gently posed question yields widespread revulsion.\nHard data now demonstrate that Americans hate the Obamacare bailout \u2014 all across the political spectrum.\nSo, the Obamacare bailout loses badly among the Nelson Rockefeller\u2013George Elmer Pataki crowd.\nIf the Obamacare bailout wants a friend, it should buy a dog.\nRubio calls the Obamacare bailout \u201cgovernment favoritism and corporate cronyism at its worst.\u201d Rubio is absolutely right."}
