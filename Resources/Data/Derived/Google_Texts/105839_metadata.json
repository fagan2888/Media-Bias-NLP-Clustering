From August to October, the crabs\u2014which get their name from the hair-like tendrils that grow on their claws\u2014sell like hotcakes throughout China.\n\nExcept, hotcakes don\u2019t sell in vending machines. Live hairy crabs? Apparently, yes. On September 11, a vending machine stocked with live crabs appeared on a street in Hangzhou, the capital of Zhejiang province. The machine, which is restocked daily, sells crabs for around 20 RMB ($3.27), along with the appropriate accoutrements (crab vinegar and two bags of ginger tea).\n\n\u201cIt arrived just this evening\u2014we\u2019re the first company in Hangzhou to have one!\u201d Mr. Liu, the vending machine\u2019s owner, told City Express . Liu, who owns the shop next door, is hoping to capture after-hours demand for crabs with the self-service machine. \u201cCrab shops like ours, they generally close at night,\u201d said Liu. \u201cBut what are people to do at night when their stomach starts to feel empty and they want to chow down on a hairy crab and knock back some booze?\u201d\n\nIf you assumed this cutting-edge invention was brand new, you were wrong. In 2010, another crab vending machine appeared in a Nanjing subway station, pictured below:\n\nLiu bought the latest crab machine from a man named Shi Tuanjie, chairman of the Gaochun Double Lake Crab Company, who owned the original machine pictured above. In its heyday, Shi\u2019s original machine sold 200 crabs a day and boasted crab-savvy innovations, such as climate control and packaging:\n\nThe machine\u2019s temperature of 5-10\u00b0 C preserved the crabs in a dormant state longer than was possible in a stall, leading many people to call them \u201csleeping crabs.\u201d\n\nBut the machine\u2019s winning characteristic was the crab packaging. Sellers typically bind the claws of hairy crabs, which supposedly hurts the flavor. To fix this, Shi built a \u201cCrab Villa,\u201d a multi-tired box designed to make crabs feel like they\u2019re in a cave. Shi says he came up with this idea one day, long after hairy crab season had ended, when he found a crab hiding under his sofa.\n\nWhat stocked the Nanjing machine, though, was Shi\u2019s upgrade of \u201cCrab Villa\u201d: an edible container that neither broke the crabs\u2019 legs nor suffocated them. Dubbed \u201cGolden Armor,\u201d Shi\u2019s new container could be dropped in boiling water at home, minimizing pinching risk.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The crustaceans even come with crab vinegar and ginger tea.", "author": "Gwynn Guilford", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "The crustaceans even come with crab vinegar and ginger tea.", "title": "China's Newest Innovation: Live Crab Vending Machines", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2013/09/rtxvtb2/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/china/archive/2013/09/chinas-newest-innovation-live-crab-vending-machines/279650/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "In 2010, another crab vending machine appeared in a Nanjing subway station, pictured below:Liu bought the latest crab machine from a man named Shi Tuanjie, chairman of the Gaochun Double Lake Crab Company, who owned the original machine pictured above.\nOn September 11, a vending machine stocked with live crabs appeared on a street in Hangzhou, the capital of Zhejiang province.\n\u201cIt arrived just this evening\u2014we\u2019re the first company in Hangzhou to have one!\u201d Mr. Liu, the vending machine\u2019s owner, told City Express .\nExcept, hotcakes don\u2019t sell in vending machines.\nLive hairy crabs?"}
