So it\u2019s about $30,000 less income where you can get the subsidy,\u201d said Heritage Foundation Senior Fellow David Burton, who noted that a quirk in federal tax law is responsible for the discrepancy.\n\n\u201cSubsidies are available to people up to 400 percent of the federal poverty level,\u201d Burton told WND. \u201cThe marriage penalty\u2019s really because of the way the poverty levels are calculated. If you have a one-person household, the poverty level is about $11,500.\u201d\n\nHe explained that for a two-person household, the poverty level is $15,500.\n\n\u201cFor those who don\u2019t want to do the math, that means that it\u2019s not twice as high,\u201d Burton said. \u201cSo the long and the short of it is that two individuals that get married don\u2019t get as much of a subsidy.\u201d\n\nHe concluded it \u201cmay very well may give people pause that are considering marriage.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of things discouraging people from getting married these days,\u201d he noted. \u201cThis will be just one more. It\u2019ll be a financially significant thing. It could amount to several thousand dollars a year of lost subsidies.\u201d\n\nWas this intentional in the new health law, or are married couples simply taking a hit over the way the poverty levels are traditionally calculated?\n\n\u201cIf you actually read the PPACA as it\u2019s called, the law which I have had the misfortune of having done, it\u2019s very badly written,\u201d Burton explained. \u201cIt was rushed through. I think it was probably a mistake, but it\u2019s just one more of many mistakes where this law wasn\u2019t well thought out.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the financial disadvantage for married couples, Burton said all Americans are headed for a nightmare come tax time when they try to determine exactly how much subsidy assistance they should be getting.\n\n\u201cThe subsidies are administered by the insurance companies in cooperation with the IRS and show up as a lower premium in the exchanges. But then, every individual in the country is going to have to do the math on their tax return due in April 2015 and reconcile how much they got from the insurance company with how much they should have gotten,\u201d said Burton.\n\nHe added that Americans will \u201cowe a lot of money\u201d if calculations show their subsidies were too big.\n\nBurton expects Obamacare supporters to resist changing the marriage rules in the law unless political pressure becomes too much to ignore. He said adopting a whole new approach to health-care reform is the best hope on the issue and for the system in general.\n\n\u201cIf we get to a point where there\u2019s a more reasoned approach to health care and it\u2019s not all so blatantly political, then I would hope that this could get resolved,\u201d Burton said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "While the Obama administration tries to douse political fires over a disastrous federal exchange website \u2013 with millions of Americans unable to keep health policies they like and others facing massive premium and deductible increases \u2013 experts now say the system also discourages marriage.
