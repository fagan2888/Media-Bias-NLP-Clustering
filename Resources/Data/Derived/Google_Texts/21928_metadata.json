But the return of the Morning Glory hardly fixes the problems confronting Libya.\n\nThree years ago today, President Obama announced that America would \u201cnot stand idly by in the face of actions that undermine global peace and security;\u201d he'd decided to order military action in \u201csupport for a set of universal values.\u201d The next day, the bombing began.\n\nHow did that work out? Splendidly! says one of the principal architects of the war, former National Security Council official Samantha Power. Last summer, after becoming U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Power tweeted: \u201cGreat example: Qadhafi fell because the Libyan people bravely stood up, the U.S. stood strong, and the Arab League stood united. #Results.\u201d\n\nLet's test that self-congratulatory hashtag against what a top official from the previous administration once contemptuously called the \u201cjudicious study of discernible reality.\u201d \u201cPolitical Killings Still Plaguing Post-Qaddafi Libya\u201d is the headline from The New York Times last week, reporting, \u201c[M]ore than 100 prominent figures, senior security officials, judges and political activists have been assassinated in two years, and the wave of killings is decimating local leadership and paralyzing the government and security forces.\u201d Unrest has likewise decimated Libya's oil production, and \u201cmilitias hold 8,000 people in prisons.\u201d\n\nBut didn't we at least stop a genocide? That's what State Department legal adviser Harold Koh suggested in an interview. Koh, previously an ardent opponent of presidential warmaking, gave Obama legal cover for Libya, arguing that bombing Libya didn't count as \u201chostilities\u201d under the War Powers Resolution.\n\nKoh defends that decision by insisting that \u201cthousands of lives were saved\u201d\u2014which isn\u2019t much of a legal argument. It\u2019s also not true.\n\nAs political scientist Alan J. Kuperman pointed out at the time, Obama \u201cgrossly exaggerated the humanitarian threat to justify military action in Libya.\u201d\n\nKuperman explained in another article, Moammar Gadhafi \u201cdid not perpetrate a \u2018bloodbath\u2019 in any of the cities that his forces recaptured from rebels prior to NATO intervention ... so there was virtually no risk of such an outcome if he had been permitted to recapture the last rebel stronghold of Benghazi.\u201d Meanwhile, wrote Kuperman, \u201c[b]y intervening, NATO enabled the rebels to resume their attack, which prolonged the war for another seven months and caused at least 7,000 more deaths.\u201d\n\nIn the run-up to the war, George Will asked a pointed question: \u201cWould not U.S. intervention in Libya encourage other restive peoples to expect U.S. military assistance?\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps it would,\u201d Will\u2019s Washington Post colleague Jackson Diehl replied a week later, shortly before the bombing began. \"Would that be a disaster?\u201d\n\nIt seems it was. As Kuperman observed, \u201cNATO\u2019s intervention on behalf of Libya\u2019s rebels also encouraged Syria\u2019s formerly peaceful protesters to switch to violence in mid-2011, in hopes of attracting a similar intervention. The resulting escalation in Syria magnified that country\u2019s killing rate by tenfold.\u201d\n\nThree years later, Obama's Libyan adventure looks like a moral vanity project carried out by careless people who couldn't be bothered to worry about unintended consequences. #Results, indeed.\n\nThis column originally appeared in the Washington Examiner.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://reason.com/archives/2014/03/18/three-years-after-us-intervention-libyas", "site_name": "Reason.com", "type": "article", "description": "Are these the \"#results\" Obama wanted?", "title": "Three Years After US Intervention, Libya's an Even Bigger Disaster"}, "twitter": {"site": "@reason", "description": "Libya&nbsp;suffered\nthrough an eventful St. Patrick's Day on Monday:&nbsp;car\nbomb attacks&nbsp;in&nbsp;Benghazi&nbsp;killed\nat least eight people, and the U.S. Navy SEALs scored \u201cone for the\nMorning Glory\u201d by&nbsp;capturing the\nrunaway oil tanker&nbsp;bearing that name in order to return it\nto the Libyan government, such as it is.\nEarlier this month, the&nbsp;", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Three Years After US Intervention, Libya's an Even Bigger Disaster"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "HomePage", "published_time": "2014-03-18T16:00:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/gene-healy"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd94b3\"", "article_summary": "As Kuperman observed, \u201cNATO\u2019s intervention on behalf of Libya\u2019s rebels also encouraged Syria\u2019s formerly peaceful protesters to switch to violence in mid-2011, in hopes of attracting a similar intervention.\nsays one of the principal architects of the war, former National Security Council official Samantha Power.\nKoh defends that decision by insisting that \u201cthousands of lives were saved\u201d\u2014which isn\u2019t much of a legal argument.\nBut the return of the Morning Glory hardly fixes the problems confronting Libya.\nKoh, previously an ardent opponent of presidential warmaking, gave Obama legal cover for Libya, arguing that bombing Libya didn't count as \u201chostilities\u201d under the War Powers Resolution."}
