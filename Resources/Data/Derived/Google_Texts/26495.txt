FALL RIVER, Mass. (AP) — Lawyers for former New England Patriots player Aaron Hernandez are expected to take a day to present their defense in his murder trial, and the jury is expected to begin deliberations soon after.

Hernandez’s legal team has said it expects to put on its only witnesses Monday, then rest.

The prosecution spent more than two months laying out its case.

Hernandez is charged with killing Odin Lloyd on June 17, 2013. Lloyd was dating the sister of Hernandez’s fiancee.

Monday’s session is expected to begin without the jury present so the judge can hear from a defense witnesses: an expert in PCP. Hernandez’s co-defendants, Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz, were seen smoking PCP on June 15, 2013.

The judge has said she expects deliberations to begin Tuesday or Wednesday.
