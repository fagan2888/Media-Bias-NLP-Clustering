Mark Handeland of Handeland Concrete LLC is back in business.

After taking nearly six years off to work for other construction companies and to help install the Southern Delivery System, Handeland said he is anxious to serve his past customers and ready to meet some new ones.

"I like being in business for myself," he said. "Customer satisfaction is my main priority; that is my No. 1 goal."

Handeland originally started his business in 1995, and he is licensed and insured. He does residential and commercial jobs, including patios and sidewalks and also does stamped concrete and stained concrete.

"Stamped is making it look like it is natural rock," he said.

Handeland said he especially enjoys doing smaller jobs for people who are unable to find contractors to tackle them.

"I do high quality work, and I treat each job like it's my own home," he said. "I complete each project to where I never have to go back to replace anything."
