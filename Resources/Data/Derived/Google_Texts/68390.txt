We are now in the seventh day of a government shutdown imposed by the House Republicans because the president and the Senate refuse to submit to their blackmail by repealing or delaying the Affordable Care Act. Now the Republicans are threatening to cause the country to default on our debt by refusing to raise the debt ceiling unless the president and the Senate surrender to further blackmail by not only repealing or delaying the Affordable Care Act but also by submitting to further, as yet unspecified, demands.



What is fundamentally at stake is the very idea of democratic government. Whether the particular hostage is the continuing resolution to re-open the government or the raising of the debt limit, governing by blackmail is fundamentally destructive to America's form of democratic government. If the majority in our government, which was duly elected last November, surrenders to the will of the minority in this situation, when would it ever stop? Why shouldn't the Democratic majority in the Senate play the same game? Where would the country be if the Senate Democrats refused to pass a budget to re-open the government and threatened to cause a default on the debt unless the Republicans agreed to a strong gun safety bill, a liberal immigration bill, and a bill liberalizing union organizing laws?
