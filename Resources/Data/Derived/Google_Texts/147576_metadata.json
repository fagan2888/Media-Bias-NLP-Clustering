Many schools are pushing back against recent school lunch guidelines. Matt McClain/The Washington Post/Getty Images\n\nThe days of mystery meat and soda-dispensing vending machines may be gone, but that doesn't mean that the new era of school meals and snacks hasn't come without its own challenges.\n\nNutrition guidelines for schools, which have gradually gone into effect since Congress passed the Michelle Obama-backed Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act in 2010, can be logistically and financially difficult for already strapped district budgets.\n\n[READ: Burger King Pulls Soda From Kids Meal Menu]\n\nIn response, earlier this month 1,000 members of the School Nutrition Association, which represents school cafeteria workers and companies that supply food and equipment to districts, lobbied Congress for more funding and flexibility when it comes to school meals.\n\nCritics have called out the group for attempting to roll back quality nutrition standards, but the members maintain they are asking for a more realistic approach.\n\nAll stakeholders agree that providing better-quality food, including whole grains, fruits and vegetables, and lower sodium, fat and calorie content will make children healthier and will help them learn better, but some school administrators grumble that the government guidelines have gone too far. Providing fresh fruits and vegetables is expensive \u2013 particularly when students are forced to put them on their trays. No one can make the students eat the healthier food, and much of it can end up in the trash.\n\nFlexibility on Meal Regulations\n\n\n\nLaura Metzger, director of food and nutrition services for Westonka Public Schools in Minnetrista, Minnesota, says the department works hard to provide fresh fruits and vegetables that are appealing to students \u2013 fresh apples, crisp oranges and lots of colorful produce.\n\nShe says the law has improved school lunches, but she doesn't think students should be forced to take items they don't want.\n\nPhotos: School Lunches Around the World EXPAND GALLERY Photo Gallery x of x Full Screen An omelette, vegetable soup, banana yogurt and water are served at school lunch at the Chiquitin kindergarten on Tuesday, May 6, 2014, in Madrid.

Achmad Ibrahim/AP x of x \u00d7\n\n\"If they don\u2019t want [a piece of fruit] for the day, then we need to improve our nutrition education and tell them why they should have it,\" she says. \"We should not force them to have it on their tray and then throw it out.\"\n\nUnder the guidelines created by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, students are required to take half a cup of fruits and vegetables but are allowed to take up to 2 cups. Calories in meals are now limited at 550 to 650 for elementary school students, 600 to 700 for middle school students, and 750 to 850 for high school students. The guidelines say that grain foods must be \u201cwhole-grain rich\u201d \u2013 meaning that each serving has 8 grams of whole grain or more \u2013 and during the next few years schools also will be required to increasingly limit sodium content.\n\n\n\nThe breakfast and lunch guidelines were implemented in 2012, and b eginning last fall anything sold while school is in session has to meet the similarly strict nutritional guidelines. Gone were the ice cream sandwiches, chocolate chip cookies and potato chips; and in were pretzels, yogurt and carrot sticks.\n\nResponse has occurred at the federal level. Early in March, Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D., announced the Healthy School Meals Flexibility Act, which would restore USDA requirements from 2012 that at least half of grains offered with school meals be whole grains. These loosened regulations would allow schools to serve items like biscuits, tortillas and pasta students will eat, Hoeven said in a statement.\n\nThe School Nutrition Association wants the law to remove the federal requirement that students take fruits and vegetables...take fruits and vegetables and keep USDA from further reducing sodium reductions below the current level. If they go to their projected levels, Hoeven said, schools would be unable to serve choices like low-fat, whole grain cheese pizza, many Asian dishes and deli sandwiches.\n\nMetzger says a lunch that fits the current sodium level would yield the following: Milk, a turkey wrap, fruit and vegetables. But when the next USDA sodium requirements go into effect in 2017, that meal could not be served.\n\n\"Deli meat is high in sodium, but it's also a pretty standard lunch,\" she says. \"In many dietitians eyes it would be considered a healthy lunch for an average student. It's getting too restrictive.\" Beginning in 2022, sodium level requirements are slated to be even lower.\n\nMetzger says she also would prefer more flexibility on the whole grain requirement. Whole grain pasta, for instance, has a tendency to break down faster, she says. It doesn't cook as well and hold up as well as regular pasta.\n\nThe School Nutrition Association backs Hoeven's bill.\n\n\u201cMinor adjustments to the most extreme restrictions under the new rules will help struggling schools bring students back to the cafeteria,\u201d Julia Bauscher, president of the School Nutrition Association, said in a statement. \u201cToo many students have swapped school lunch for unhealthy alternatives, which defeats the goal of the standards and reduces revenue to invest in healthy, appealing menus.\u201d\n\n\n\n[ALSO: Coming to a School Lunch Tray Near You]\n\nAre the Standards Even Working?\n\nSome research has suggested that the changes may be producing desired results.\n\nA study conducted by the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity at the University of Connecticut published earlier this month in \"Childhood Obesity\" showed that children in schools are eating more fruit, and that they are throwing away less of their lunch. The study showed the percent of students choosing fruit with lunch increased from 54 percent to 66 percent. Students also are eating 84 percent of their healthier entrees, up from 71 percent in 2012.\n\nBut the study was limited to 12 schools in one district. Anecdotally, many education professionals say they still see a lot of waste. Students have held boycotts against cafeterias, and often post photos of their lunches on Twitter and Instagram using the hashtag #ThanksMichelleObama. Some depict healthy, tasty-looking meals. Others are sarcastic.\n\n\"It's only good nutrition if you're eating it,\" points out Carol Weekly, director of child nutrition for Queen Creek Unified School District in Arizona. Some students are forgoing the program in favor of bringing their own Lunchable, she says.\n\n@leonardkl @usnews Photo of student lunch today (actual student tray) in RSU #14 in Maine. #SchoolLunch pic.twitter.com/VzXfud766r \u2014 Jeanne Reilly (@Lunch4KidsRSU14) March 12, 2015\n\n\n\nLinette Dodson, director of school nutrition at Carrollton City Schools in Georgia, doesn\u2019t take issue with the government standards but says she would like to see more research on the impact of sodium before lowering its content in food.\n\nFinancial Troubles in Meeting Guidelines\n\nWeekly says her district had been providing mostly whole grains for years. When the standards came in place, however, students turned their nose at the whole-grain burrito \u2013 what was once a best-seller. In that region, she says, people simply eat light tortillas, not brown ones. She also noticed pizza sales have dwindled.\n\n\"I don't know how much more I can afford,\" says Weekly, whose children eat the school lunch every day, too. \"It's too rigid and too expensive. I can't charge $4 for lunch.\n\n\"I have to figure out where to cut costs. I don't want to cut the quality of the food, but I'm at the point where I might have to.\" If Congress were to allot more funding, she would be fine with the guidelines, she says.\n\nThe School Nutrition Association is pushing for Congress to increase the per meal reimbursement for school breakfast and lunch by 35 cents \u2013 up from 6 cents per lunch the USDA offers for schools currently meeting the new standards.\n\n@SchoolMealsRock at Burris Laboratory School!! #SchoolLunch #ThanksMichelleObama pic.twitter.com/vcJQX48K37 \u2014 Amanda Kruse RD CD (@Amanda_Kruse) March 11, 2015\n\nAcross the U.S., any school that accepts federal funding for the National School Lunch Program must follow the guidelines, unless its state approves exemptions. USDA pays schools back about $2.98 per lunch served to a child eligible for free meals. The breakfast and lunch programs reimburse schools for the meals they serve and provides food at a reduced cost to feed students who are low-income.\n\nUSDA projected that the new rules would cost schools $1.2 billion in food and work expenses this year.\n\nThe majority of the nation's public and non-profit schools \u2013 roughly 95 percent, or 100,000 \u2013 participate in the School Lunch Program, but about 500 schools dropped out because of the new meal standards. They cited factors such as increasing costs, resource constraints and plate waste. Data show many of the schools were small, affluent, private or charter schools, or Residential Child Care Institutions.\n\n[ALSO: Barbara Bush Wants to Help Improve Nutrition Worldwide]\n\nThe UDSA appears to understand that meeting the requirements can be challenging and will take time. On Monday, the agency announced its Team Up for Success program to help individual schools with menu planning, financial management and food waste.\n\nDodson says getting over an overall negative perception of the regulations has been one of her district's goals. They have held taste tests and organized social media and community campaigns. She has observed schools that started the standards early tend to be the most successful. \"Obviously additional funding is always beneficial,\" she says.\n\nPush also is happening at the state level. The Minnesota School Nutrition Association, for instance, is asking state legislators for increased funding to help offset rising costs of food associated with requirements of the law.\n\nSmart Snack Regulations\n\n\n\nOther changes occurring at the state level are through the Smart Snacks program, which applies to foods sold during the school day in vending machines, \u00e0 la carte lines and school stores \u2013 specifically on school grounds.\n\nAligning guidelines for snacks with meals helps with consistent messaging, says Lainie Morgan, senior program coordinator for nutrition and wellness at the Health Information Network, a non-profit created by the National Education Association that responds to health-related needs for members and their students.\n\nAte this meal at Burke county schools in Georgia #ThanksMichelleObama #schoollunch #actuallydelicious pic.twitter.com/rgNeHAaZwV \u2014 Elodie Bouchard (@BouchardElodie) March 12, 2015\n\n\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re being taught in your classroom to eat fruits and vegetables and whole grains, and drink low-fat milk, and then you get into the hallways and they\u2019re selling doughnuts and candy bars, it\u2019s hard to keep that message going,\u201d she says.\n\nChildren can bring what they want to school for a snack, and events like birthday parties or holidays are not affected. But sales of snacks are often a means of funding school field trips and student clubs. Under the law, states can allow bake sales and fundraisers during the school day with foods that don\u2019t meet healthy standards if they choose. If they do not make exemptions, states default to the federal guidelines.\n\n\u201cLots of schools are being creative with fundraising,\u201d Morgan says. They are selling food that satisfies the nutrition requirements, or they are finding other, non food-related ways to make money \u2013 selling wrapping papers, having costume days, or even through physical activity challenges like dance nights and races.\n\nThe District of Columbia, Connecticut, Mississippi and Oregon already have policies that set standards for fundraisers, according to the National Association of State Boards of Education. Twenty-five states have not created exemptions, and therefore have to meet the federal standards.\n\nThe Virginia General Assembly is considering a bill that would grant exemptions. Other states limit the number of fundraisers allowed. Indiana, for instance, allows two fundraisers per year per building. Missouri allows five, and North Dakota allows three. Fundraising opportunities help many schools fill gaps lost from state or district budgets. In areas struggling economically, it can be particularly challenging.\n\n\"It\u2019s a good program,\" Weekly says. \"We serve kids. It is healthy. There just needs to be the practical and realistic versus what looks good on paper.\"\n\nCorrected on March 13, 2015: This article has been updated with information from the Pew Charitable Trusts, and to correct the percentage of healthy entrees eaten in 2012 and the amount of money the USDA pays schools back per lunch.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Pulse", "title": "Advocates, States Take a Bite Out of School Nutrition Law", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Adjusting to the food guidelines can be difficult for many schools.&nbsp;", "title": "Advocates, States Take a Bite Out of School Nutrition Law", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2015/03/13/advocates-states-take-a-bite-out-of-school-nutrition-law", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/a5/31/3acdf34041d78d52f7c400efa1be/150312-schoollunch-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "Adjusting to the food guidelines can be difficult for many schools.&nbsp;", "card": "summary", "title": "Advocates, States Take a Bite Out of School Nutrition Law"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "news", "date_published": "March 13, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Kimberly Leonard,children's health,picks,Pulse", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Adjusting to the food guidelines can be difficult for many schools.&nbsp;"}, "article_summary": "Calories in meals are now limited at 550 to 650 for elementary school students, 600 to 700 for middle school students, and 750 to 850 for high school students.\nThe Minnesota School Nutrition Association, for instance, is asking state legislators for increased funding to help offset rising costs of food associated with requirements of the law.\nThe School Nutrition Association backs Hoeven's bill.\n\"I don't know how much more I can afford,\" says Weekly, whose children eat the school lunch every day, too.\nManu Fernandez/AP x of x Full Screen Two lunch trays are served at a primary school in London."}
