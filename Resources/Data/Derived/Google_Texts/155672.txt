A Knoxville woman has been getting a lot of attention, after a sign she held up during the president and vice president's visit Friday went viral.

The sign said "Joe Biden is my spirit animal."

Kristina McLean says a picture of her with the sign was re-tweeted by national reporters and mentioned in a white house news release.

Since then she's gotten more than 100 responses online.

But she says the highlight was when Biden himself pointed to her and waved.

"I really appreciate how hard he worked to get Obamacare passed. As a breast cancer survivor, it's really important to me. Without it, without getting rid of the pre-existing conditions clause, I would never be able to get insurance again," she says.

McLean says the next time she sees Biden she hopes she can meet him in person, and maybe even meet up for a beer.
