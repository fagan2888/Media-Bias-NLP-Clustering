Despite Vice President Joe Biden’s pop cultural appeal and feminist attitudes, Jon Stewart does not think Biden will be the Democratic candidate for the 2016 presidential election because “It’s like Biden hasn’t been out of the house since 1962.”

Biden, known for his affable, old man quirkiness, used racist terms and stereotypes in recent speeches, referring to Asia as “the Orient” and also used the term “shylock.” While Biden has apologized for the offensive language, Stewart opines that the damage is done.
