Having \u201creformed\u201d US medicine, he now aims to \u201crepair\u201d the World Wide Web. If you like ObamaCare, you\u2019ll love ObamaNet.\n\nOn Feb. 26, the Federal Communications Commission will vote on a \u201cnet neutrality\u201d proposal to regulate broadband networks as if they were telephone monopolies back when copper wire was high tech.\n\nObamaNet would let Uncle Sam intervene in the price, product-innovation, and capacity decisions of Internet Service Providers, or ISPs.\n\nNet neutrality? Let\u2019s call it net brutality.\n\nLike ObamaCare, ObamaNet would impose complex rules via Title II of the Communications Act of 1934. FDR signed that legislation seven years after \u201cThe Jazz Singer\u201d (the first talkie) and seven years before Pearl Harbor. Astride this 81-year-old steed, Obama would lead the Internet\u2019s charge into the 21st century.\n\nOnce ObamaNet ropes ISPs into Title II, they\u2019ll need FCC approval for new products, business models, data-traffic operations and more. Rather than focus on inventions and improvements, Silicon Valley execs will have to machete their way through Title II\u2019s 682 pages and 987 rule sections.\n\nThey can ask \u201cforbearance\u201d from these regulations. Good luck: According to the National Cable Telecommunications Association, the FCC makes the average applicant wait 53 weeks for an answer. Since 1996, about 69 percent of such requests have failed, at least partly.\n\nObamaNet would pick pockets. \u201cBillions of dollars in fees will be attached to the Internet service,\u201d warns Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah). ISPs then would \u201cpass them on to you, the consumer.\u201d\n\nLiberal think-tank scholars Robert Litan of the Brookings Institution and Hal Singer of the Progressive Policy Institute calculate that state fees will climb $67 a year for landline-broadband accounts and $72 for wireless.\n\nFederal taxes per household will rise $17. They predict that \u201cthe new fees could reach $15 billion per year.\u201d\n\nWhy squeeze $156 a year out of each typical broadband customer? What agony would ObamaNet assuage?\n\nThough unaffordable, gargantuan and tyrannical, ObamaCare does address a legitimate challenge: insuring Americans who lack health coverage. A lower-cost, pro-patient replacement remains vital.\n\nStill, ObamaCare \u2014 despite countless flaws \u2014 tries to answer a real-life problem that vexes millions of Americans.\n\nNot so, ObamaNet.\n\nIs any American so inclined unable to go online? Cheap computers with built-in browsers grant instant access to the Internet\u2019s treasures.\n\nCan\u2019t buy an Internet-capable computer or smart phone? Public libraries offer free gateways to Amazon, eBay, YouTube and virtually every recorded example of human wisdom and folly via Google.\n\nObama claims that evil ISPs are delaying faster connections and denying consumers access to their speediest networks.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re watching the loading icon spin,\u201d Obama complained Jan. 14. \u201cYou\u2019re waiting, and waiting, and waiting.
