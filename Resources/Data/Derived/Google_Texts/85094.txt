Just 31% Trust the IRS

The IRS has a PR problem.

It’s bad enough being the tax collector, but 50% of Likely U.S. Voters don’t trust the Internal Revenue Service to fairly enforce tax laws. A new Rasmussen Reports national telephone survey finds that 31% do trust the IRS to enforce the laws fairly, but 19% more are not sure. (To see survey question wording, click here.)
