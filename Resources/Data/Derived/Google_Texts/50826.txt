A Prague, Oklahoma, woman who was injured in a 5.6 magnitude earthquake in November 2011 is suing several energy companies.

According to the Journal Record, Prague resident Sandra Ladra is suing more than 25 energy companies, including Cleveland-based Spess Oil Company, and Tulsa-based New Dominion, LL for at least $75,000 in damages.

She claims they caused the earthquake that left her severely injured.

According to court records filed in Lincoln County District Court, Ladra said she was sitting in her living room when the earthquake struck. The tremors were so bad, she claims it caused her chimney to collapse, and the rocks fell on her legs and lap. She was taken to the hospital.

Her attorney said Ladra will likely need knee replacement surgery. Ladra also alleged each company's high-pressure injection wells led to several other earthquakes in the area around the same time.

In a statement released to "The Journal Record," Steve Spess, a manager of Spess Oil, said his company injects water at low pressure and they don't believe that is causing the earthquakes.
