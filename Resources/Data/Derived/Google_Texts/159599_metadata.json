And I\u2019m going to give it to them. And I am not going to apologize for my life.\u201d\n\nIn another scene, the fictional political newbie says, \u201cI have what is called \u2018f--k you money,\u2019 which means I don\u2019t have to listen to anyone.\u201d\n\nQuaid says he\u2019s personally met Trump several times and considers him a \u201cfun guy.\u201d He studied the former reality TV star\u2019s mannerisms for the \u201cArt of More\u201d role: \u201c[Trump\u2019s] the epitome of it. But people in politics, politicians, and also a lot of these billionaires that are out there sort of in public business, they have big personalities. And sometimes have the same physical ticks \u2014 and Donald was really good for that.\u201d\n\nWhile the 61-year-old \u201cFar From Heaven\u201d star, a political independent, hasn\u2019t decided who he\u2019s voting for in 2016 and is waiting to \u201chear everybody out,\u201d he says he\u2019s unsure what Trump will think of the Crackle series\u2019 character.\n\n\u201cOf course I thought of Trump when I was doing this character, but he\u2019s not Trump,\u201d explains Quaid. \u201cBut they certainly can be cousins,\u201d he says with a big chuckle.\n\n\u201cThe Art of More\u201d premieres on Crackle on Thursday.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The actor plays a real estate mogul with political aspirations in Crackle's new show.", "description": "The actor plays a real estate mogul with political aspirations in Crackle's new show.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "In The Know"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The actor plays a real estate mogul with political aspirations in Crackle's new show.", "title": "Dennis Quaid: 'I thought of Trump' for new role", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/260444-dennis-quaid-i-thought-of-trump-for-new-role", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/elwescary_bosworthkate_quaiddennis11172015getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T05:25-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/260444-dennis-quaid-i-thought-of-trump-for-new-role", "dcterms.date": "2015-11-17T14:22-05:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Tristan Lejeune", "author": "Judy Kurtz", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-17T14:22:38-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/260444-dennis-quaid-i-thought-of-trump-for-new-role", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The actor plays a real estate mogul with political aspirations in Crackle's new show.", "card": "summary", "title": "Dennis Quaid: 'I thought of Trump' for new role"}, "dcterms.title": "Dennis Quaid: 'I thought of Trump' for new role"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1b07\"", "article_summary": "\u201cOf course I thought of Trump when I was doing this character, but he\u2019s not Trump,\u201d explains Quaid.\nADVERTISEMENT\u201cWe were going about the fourth or fifth episode when Trump announced that he was going to run for president,\u201d Quaid says.\n\u201cI have a one-word response to those rumors: bull---t,\u201d Quaid, as Brukner, declares to a crowd in one preview clip.\n\u201cPeople are fed up with these do-nothing, two-faced politicians,\u201d Brukner says, \u201cThey want something real.\n\u201cAll this stuff that was in our show was kind of being mirrored in a sense there.\u201d\u201cIt was an opportune moment,\u201d he adds with a laugh."}
