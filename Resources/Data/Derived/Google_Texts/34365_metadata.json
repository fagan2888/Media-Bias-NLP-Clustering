Emphasis mine:\n\nBy the time Democrats returned to Washington after Election Day, an irascible few, like Senators Claire McCaskill of Missouri and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, were saying they could no longer support Mr. Reid as leader.\n\nIf this has humbled him in any way, he is not showing it. \u201cThey didn\u2019t have anybody running against me,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it made it kind of tough for them. It\u2019s hard to lose an election when you don\u2019t have anybody running against you.\u201d\n\n\u2026\n\nMr. Reid, 75, said he would run again when his term is up in 2016, despite many predictions that this was his last in Washington. In defiance of his skeptics, he said he was going to start hiring a campaign staff in February. Republicans will be gunning for him, and they are hoping to recruit Nevada\u2019s popular governor, Brian Sandoval, as an opponent.\n\nThis, too, does not ruffle Mr. Reid. \u201cBrian, if he wants to run, more power to him. He\u2019d make an excellent candidate,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of excellent candidates, you know.\u201d\n\nReid would seem to have a lot in common with Ivan Drago from \u201cRocky IV,\u201d the Soviet boxer who exclaims to the crowd and the premier during a match, \u201cI fight to win for me.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Soon-to-be Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid lamented the poor Obamacare rollout, blamed the president for Democrat losses in the midterm elections, and talked himself up in an interview published Wednesday, securing his status as the political equivalent of a \"Rocky\" villain.", "title": "Harry Reid is pretty much Ivan Drago at this point - Red Alert...", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2014/04/Harry-Reid-600x384.jpg", "height": 384}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2014/12/10/harry-reid-pretty-much-ivan-drago-point/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "rocky-iv", "published_time": "2014-12-10T16:50:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-10T17:53:35+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda737\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe never recovered from the [Obamacare] rollout because the election became one that was directed toward the president,\u201d Reid told The New York Times.\nThis, too, does not ruffle Mr. Reid.\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t overcome that.\u201dReid also commented on his standing inside the Democratic Party, which can be described as IDGA[expletive].\nRepublicans will be gunning for him, and they are hoping to recruit Nevada\u2019s popular governor, Brian Sandoval, as an opponent.\nSoon-to-be Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid lamented the poor Obamacare rollout, blamed the president for Democrat losses in the midterm elections, and talked himself up in an interview published Wednesday, securing his status as the political equivalent of a \u201cRocky\u201d villain."}
