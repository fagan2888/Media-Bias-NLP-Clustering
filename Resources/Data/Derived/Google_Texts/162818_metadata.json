(September 1, 2015) (Photo: Tim Webb, Special to the CJ)Buy Photo\n\nLet\u2019s get one thing clear. Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis wasn\u2019t jailed on Thursday because of her religious beliefs. She was jailed because she is a government official who refused to follow a legal and direct order from a federal judge designed to protect others' constitutional rights.\n\nIt\u2019s a classic case of a local authority disagreeing with federal courts and trying to push back \u2013 only to lose in the end.\n\nIt happened when Arkansas Gov. Orval Faubus called out the National Guard to keep black students out of Little Rock\u2019s Central High School nearly 60 years ago.\n\nPresident Dwight D. Eisenhower, a Republican president who understood the rule of law, ended that fiasco when he federalized the Arkansas National Guard troops and sent them back to their barracks. He then sent in 101st Airborne to protect the African American students.\n\nIt happened with Alabama Gov. George Wallace, who in his early 1963 inaugural address proclaimed, \u201csegregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever.\u201d\n\nIt was actually segregation for six months, as President John F. Kennedy, who also understood the rule of law, sent in the Alabama National Guard on June 11 of that year to remove Wallace from the doorway of the University of Alabama, allowing Vivian Malone and James A. Hood to pass.\n\nAnd it happened in 1970, three years after the court reversed the decision of Leon Bazile, a Virginia Circuit Court judge, who ruled a white man and a black woman committed a serious crime when they married.\n\n\u201cAlmighty God created the races white, black, yellow, Malay and red, and he placed them on separate continents. ... The fact that he separated the races shows that he did not intend for the races to mix,\u201d Bazile had written, relying on a religious argument to deprive people of what the courts later said was a fundamental right to marry.\n\nEven though the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that Bazile was wrong in 1967, a handful of states continued to fight it.\n\nPresident Richard Nixon, a Republican who at least in that case understood the rule of law, had enough of the lawlessness by 1970 and sent his Justice Department into Alabama to force Probate Judge Clyde Brittain to finally comply with the Supreme Court ruling and allow Louis Voyer, a white soldier, to marry Phyllis Bett, a black woman from Anniston, Ala.\n\nLike Faubus, Wallace and Brittain, Davis is a Democrat.\n\nBut a funny thing happened on the way to the federal courthouse. The politicians rushing to her defense and saying that she has the constitutional right to ignore the Supreme Court are largely Republicans.\n\nRepublican gubernatorial candidate Matt Bevin. Republican attorney general candidate Whitney Westerfield. Republican presidential candidates Rand Paul, Bobby Jindal and Ted Cruz. Heck, Mike Huckabee even said he\u2019ll come to Kentucky on Tuesday to support Davis.\n\nThe only Republican presidential candidate who has publicly opposed Davis is Carly Fiorina, who has said the clerk needs to either issue marriage licenses or quit her job.\n\nU.S. Sen. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, never a culture warrior, has been silent, likely finding the idea of undermining the rule of law and undermining his Republican friends equally distasteful.\n\nThe Republican stance is quite a change from the GOP of old, which fancied itself as the law and order party since at least the days of Barry Goldwater. It\u2019s also the same party that has complained incessantly that President Barack Obama\u2019s use of executive orders are the acts of a renegade executive who won\u2019t submit to the rule of law.\n\nOne should remember that while some of Obama\u2019s actions have been judged to overstep his constitutional authority, Obama is yet to defy a direct order from a court.\n\nAs Davis cooled her heels in the Carter County Jail, her lawyers held a press conference on Friday to say that she was doing well behind bars, comparing her to Martin Luther King Jr., the civil rights icon who was jailed several times for standing up to authorities who allowed the government to run over the rights of blacks.\n\nIn the celebrated case of Ms. Davis, she is closer to Faubus, Wallace and Britain.\n\nKing fought against the government and its racist laws; like Faubus, Wallace and Brittain, Davis is the government.\n\nJoseph Gerth can be reached at (502) 582-4702 or jgerth@courier-journal.com.
