The officer conducted a traffic stop and took Bogan into custody.\n\nBogan is charged with several sex offenses, second degree assault and other charges.\n\nLast week, the victim told police a man followed her into an elevator at her Forestville apartment complex. When she got off the elevator, the man forced her to the ground and sexually assaulted her. He then ran from the scene.\n\nA few days later, the girl's mother spotted the suspect and pursued him. The woman was able to knock the man down, but he eventually got away. But thanks to her encounter with the suspect, investigators were able to release a detailed description of the suspect, including several unique tattoos.\n\nA tipster later identified the man police were looking for as Bogan.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The man wanted in connection with the sexual assault of a 12-year-old girl is now in police custody.", "title": "Man Accused of Sexually Assaulting Girl, 12, Arrested", "og": {"site_name": "NBC4 Washington", "description": "The man wanted in connection with the sexual assault of a 12-year-old girl is now in police custody.", "title": "Man Accused of Sexually Assaulting Girl, 12, Arrested", "url": "http://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/Suspect-Accused-of-Sexually-Assaulting-Girl-12-Arrested-304536321.html", "image": "http://media.nbcwashington.com/images/1200*675/bogan.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The man wanted in connection with the sexual assault of a 12-year-old girl is now in police custody.", "title": "Man Accused of Sexually Assaulting Girl, 12, Arrested", "url": "http://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/Suspect-Accused-of-Sexually-Assaulting-Girl-12-Arrested-304536321.html", "image": "http://media.nbcwashington.com/images/1200*675/bogan.jpg?ak=bc", "creator": "@nbcwashington", "site": "@nbcwashington", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "tp": {"preferredRuntimes": "Flash,HTML5", "FlashBlacklist": "None|None", "preferredFormats": "mpeg4,m3u,webm,ogg,flv,F4M"}, "fb": {"app_id": 168641655540}, "keywords": "local news, washington dc news, maryland news, northern virginia news, breaking news, northwest washington, rockville, prince george's county, fairfax county, montgomery county, arlington county, metro, wmata, dc, nova, va, md", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/nbcwashington"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "When she got off the elevator, the man forced her to the ground and sexually assaulted her.\nThe man wanted in connection with the sexual assault of a 12-year-old girl is now in police custody.\nThe woman was able to knock the man down, but he eventually got away.\nLast week, the victim told police a man followed her into an elevator at her Forestville apartment complex.\nA tipster later identified the man police were looking for as Bogan."}
