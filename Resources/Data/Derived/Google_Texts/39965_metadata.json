Shareholders can determine whether their corporation\u2019s political speech advances the corporation\u2019s interest in making profits, and citizens can see whether elected officials are \u2018in the pocket\u2019 of so-called moneyed interests.\u201d\n\nThe problem with this particular assumption, which economists call perfect information, is that corporations are, surprise surprise, not legally obligated to share information on political spending with their shareholders or the public. In August 2011, a group of high-profile law professors filed a petition with the Securities and Exchange Commission, calling on the agency to require public companies to disclose what corporate resources they spend on political activities because \u201cmost political spending remains opaque to investors in most publicly traded companies.\u201d\n\nWhy do companies spend money on politics? The answer seems obvious: they want to generate profits. They are seeking advantages like reduced trade barriers, government contracts, easier regulatory inspections, and lower tax rates. For more on this point, see my colleague Tom Ferguson\u2019s recent paper with Paul Jorgensen and Jie Chen, which reveals how \u201cToo Big to Fail\u201d Wall Street firms and telecom companies have captured the GOP and the Democrats, respectively. (As an aside, isn\u2019t it odd that the same companies orchestrating the expansion of the surveillance state are so concerned about their own privacy?)\n\nBut there is sufficient research to suggest there is another, more covert reason that has serious consequences for shareholders. In my recently published Roosevelt Institute paper on the costs and benefits of this disclosure rule, I cite several studies that show corporate executives frequently spend on politics for their own personal advantage rather than the company\u2019s bottom line. These personal benefits include things like prestige, a future political career, star power, or assistance for political allies.\n\nWith these kinds of distorted incentives, the lack of information available to the public about corporate political spending puts shareholders and potential investors at enormous risk. Why would they want to invest in a company that is undertaking activities that are more likely to benefit its executives than its investors?
