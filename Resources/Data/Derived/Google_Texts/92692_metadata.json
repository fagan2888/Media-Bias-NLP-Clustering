Yeah, me neither.\n\nThe media reports about the \u201cnew\u201d agreement also highlight the following statement about the company\u2019s policy for contacting customers by phone: \u201cUnless the law says we cannot, we may modify or suppress caller ID and similar services and identify ourselves on these services in any manner we choose.\u201d\n\nCreepy? Yes. New? No. The very same language is in agreements that millions of Capital One customers already had.\n\nRelated: Consumers Rethink the Credit-Card Life\n\nThe fuss seems to have arisen when former cardholders from HSBC Bank had their accounts transferred to Virginia-based Capital One after that company the bought HSBC\u2019s card business. The cardholders received mailers from the bank informing them that their member agreement had changed. But the new agreement was a result of the change in ownership of the business, not a change of policy on the part of Capital One.\n\nHowever unfounded the reports of a change in policy may have been, Capital One has been forced to respond to the public outcry. A statement on the bank\u2019s website said the company wanted to \u201cclarify\u201d its position.\n\n\u201cCapital One does not visit our cardholders, nor do we send debt collectors to their homes or work,\u201d it reads, noting that there is an exception in place for big-ticket sports vehicles, such as snow mobiles and jet skis, which may be repossessed for non-payment.\n\nRelated: Your Credit Card Is Getting a High-Tech Makeover\n\nOn the issue of modifying or suppressing caller ID functions, the bank dodged the question, saying, \u201cWe want our calls to display as Capital One on caller id and that\u2019s the way they are programmed. However, some local phone exchanges may display our number differently. This is beyond our control, and we want our cardholders to be aware of that potential occurrence.\u201d The language in the agreement clearly implies an active effort on the part of the bank to mask its identity in phone calls, which is not addressed in the statement.\n\nFinally, the bank wrote, \u201cWe are reviewing the language because we do not want to create any unnecessary insecurity among our customers.\u201d\n\nProbably too late for that now, but for many Capital One customers, ignorance was, apparently, bliss.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The fuss over credit card giant Capital One\u2019s supposed change to its card member agreement only shows that nobody reads those things in the first place.", "title": "Capital One\u2019s Scary New Contract Isn\u2019t Really New", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/02/18/Capital-One-s-Scary-New-Contract-Isn-t-Really-New", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/02182014_Capital_One_Baldwin2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/02/18/Capital-One-s-Scary-New-Contract-Isn-t-Really-New", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/02182014_Capital_One_Baldwin2.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The fuss over credit card giant Capital One\u2019s supposed change to its card member agreement only shows that nobody reads those things in the first place.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0bb7\"", "article_summary": "Here\u2019s a Capital One card member agreement from last year with exactly the same language \u2013 remember the outrage when this one was mailed out?\nHowever unfounded the reports of a change in policy may have been, Capital One has been forced to respond to the public outcry.\nThe very same language is in agreements that millions of Capital One customers already had.\nBut the new agreement was a result of the change in ownership of the business, not a change of policy on the part of Capital One.\nThe cardholders received mailers from the bank informing them that their member agreement had changed."}
