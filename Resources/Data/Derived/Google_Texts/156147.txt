Count billionaire Donald Trump among the unimpressed with former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush’s announcement Tuesday that he will form an exploratory committee to consider a presidential run."The last thing we need is another Bush," Trump said Tuesday on Fox News Channel's "Your World with Neil Cavuto.""I’m not a fan of the job his brother did at all. I think his brother was a terrible president," Trump said. "Look, I’m a Republican, and I’m a very conservative guy."But, he said: "I’ve had it with the Bushes."He blasted Jeb Bush for releasing 250,000 emails from his years as governor."You have to release your emails now to run for office? It sounds like a child," Trump said.Barack Obama has been a "terrible president," Trump said, but he said George W. Bush wasn’t much better."And Bush gave us Obama," he said.Trump also blamed George W. Bush for appointing John Roberts as chief justice, thus bringing about the 2012 ruling in favor of Obamacare.George W. Bush presided over the "total destabilizaion of the world," Trump said. "I am not a fan of the Bush group."Cavuto asked whether Trump would toss his own hat into the ring.Trump said he is happy doing what is already is doing, but added he is "giving it very, very serious thought."He wouldn’t say how he would vote if it came down to a general election between Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton. He said Clinton has her own problems with the far-left wing of the Democrat Party pushing for a more liberal candidate.
