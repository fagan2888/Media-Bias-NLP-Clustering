The Michigan Nurses Association has filed an unfair labor complaint against Sparrow Hospital in Lansing.

It stems from the hospital's recent decision to close its substance abuse intake unit and move services to the hospital's main campus.

The MNA said employees were forbidden from talking about the decision with the press or posting on social media.

They said employees who violated those rules were threatened with disciplinary action and termination.

Jeff Breslin is an RN and president of the Professional Employee Council of Sparrow Hospital.

"Employees are protected when they see something going on that is not in the best interest of patients or the staff. They are protected to speak out about it," Breslin said.

Breslin said he and other employees are concerned about how the hospital's decision will affect current patients.

"There should be a full discussion to decide what really is the best thing for the patients that would normally seek treatment in this substance abuse unit," he said.

Sparrow Hospital issued a statement that it will continue to provide outpatient substance abuse and addiction treatment in the community.

The hospital had no comment on the unfair labor complaint.
