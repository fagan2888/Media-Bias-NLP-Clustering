Plus, Pete Souza is now the guy all the White House correspondents hate! They are like \u201cPROPAGANDA\u201d! And I\u2019m kind of like, \u201cScoop, if true! Not very good propaganda, if scoop.\u201d\n\nAna Marie: Except did you see in all the interviews, people are like, \u201cWell, I\u2019ve worked with Pete, and he\u2019s great, but NYAH NYAH NYAH ACCESS HOG.\u201d\n\nJason: Who to root for? White House photographers who think they deserve a defining image of Obama eating lunch? Or Pete Souza and his many crutches? It\u2019s like this Chelsea/Manchester United game I\u2019m about to watch only there is nothing actually at stake.\n\nAna Marie: [Insert knowledgable joke about soccer here.] I feel like in most White House coverage, nothing is at stake. As we have discussed, it is the beat is designed to disincentivize actual reporting.\n\nJason: Mutually assured meh.\n\nAna Marie: Well, this is awkward.\n\nJason: This is like the Doctor Who special where a bunch of Doctors Who appear in one episode to solve a big problem except in this case it\u2019s like \u201cOMG NO, SOMEONE INVITED COLIN BAKER!\u201d And you know the planet is doomed.\n\nAna Marie: I have trouble believing that Bush didn\u2019t try the \u201cpull my finger\u201d joke at least once on that trip. Maybe twice.\n\nJason: Michelle seems to be having a good time, though. I have a theory that when he\u2019s removed from situations where there are actual stakes, Dubya is actually really hilarious.\n\nAna Marie: I guess? I think his sense of humor probably doesn\u2019t get much beyond \u201cThat\u2019s what she said!\u201d (and \u201cpull my finger\u201d). He was the Michael Scott of presidents. Only more wars. He\u2019d be the loveable doofus jock except for the crimes against humanity!\n\nJason: Yeah, like I said it was the whole \u201cdoin\u2019 stuff where there was high stakes\u201d that really did him in.\n\nAna Marie: I cannot get over how that baby looks like Ted Cruz.\n\nJason: Obama meets with the Senate Conservative Fund Babies.\n\nAna Marie: If Ted Cruz were really a small child, it would explain a lot.\n\nJason: Oh, I would love to meet a small child who is as haughty as Ted Cruz. That would be so adorable.\n\nAna Marie: Ted Cruz is Veruca Salt of senators. If he were three, then the tantrums would be more understandable. As would be his understanding of political negotiation and women.\n\nJason: \u201cOHH!\u201d **pinches cheek** \u201cYou just think you are the greatest thing since the combustion engine!\u201d\n\nAna Marie: \u201cMINE MINE MINE YOU SMELL BAD POOPY FACE\u201d Which I think was his original debate team fall back position.\n\nJason: ANA YOU ARE GIVING ME TED CRUZ FILIBUSTER FLASHBACKS\n\nAna Marie: He ruined childhood for everyone.\n\nAna Marie: When I first read the caption, I read it as \u201cthe casual attire accounts for the excitement.\u201d Because otherwise there\u2019s not really an explanation for \u201cYay\u201d arms. Obama\u2019s\u2026on the phone with John Kerry? Unless he\u2019s about to hang up, I just don\u2019t see aides cheering for anything about that. Unless Obama is in the middle of *prank calling* John Kerry. Which I think could be hilarious.\n\nJason: Right, it\u2019s like Obama is saying, \u201cOkay, John\u2026well, John I better be going\u2026yep, yep\u2026Okay, John,\u201d and the other two are cheering him on.\n\nAna Marie: They decided who was going to have to talk to him by a round of rock paper scissors. \u201cYou call him.\u201d \u201cNO, you call him.\u201d \u201cI called him last time!\u201d \u201cOk ok ok\u2026 [three hours later] Uh-huh, really? Ok, John. No, we\u2019re good. The chocolate there *is* delicious, but we\u2019re good. I have a watch. I have to go now, John\u2026.\u201d\n\nJason: And that\u2019s when it hit Obama: \u201cGuys, maybe we negotiate the terms of the Iran deal over several rounds of high stakes Rochambeau!\u201d\n\nAna Marie: YOU ARE FULL OF REFERENCES I DO NOT UNDERSTAND. I am but a simple midwestern girl now.\n\nJason: Hahaha, Rochambeau is another name for Rock-Paper-Scissors I thought?\n\nAna Marie: Oh, I did not know that. French. JOHN KERRY CALLS IT THAT.\n\nJason: OMG. Exactly! It\u2019s actually \u201cRoshambo,\u201d but with Kerry on the brain I Frenchified it.\n\nAna Marie: Uh\u2026this is just a picture of Denis McDonough\u2019s feet.\n\nJason: For those who are into that sort of thing.\n\nAna Marie: Now you can understand the arguments over Souza\u2019s access. It\u2019s not even a very good picture of Denis McDonough\u2019s feet? This is Souza just saying \u201cfuck you\u201d to every photographer employed by a news agency.\n\nJason: Basically.\n\nAna Marie: \u201cLook guys, I take this access so much for granted I AM TAKING PICTURES OF FEET.\u201d NOT EVEN THE PRESIDENT\u2019S FEET.\n\nAna Marie: I will give Souza this. Bo is in a lot more pix, it seems like. Though I don\u2019t like the look the President is giving him here.\n\nJason: The caption says, \u201cEach morning, the President always enters through this door rather than the direct outside door to the Oval Office.\u201d YOU KNOW JUST LIKE AN ILLEGITIMATE USURPER.\n\nAna Marie: Also, \u201cBo was just hanging out in the Outer Oval Office when the President walked in\u2026\u201d would be a great first line to a children\u2019s book. Or a disgusting porn fantasy.\n\nJason: OMG, haaaa and GROSS and haaaa.\n\nAna Marie: \u201cBo was just hanging out in the Outer Oval Office\u201d also makes me wonder about just how much access Bo has. AND WHO REALLY CALLS THE SHOTS.\n\nAna Marie: I want to like this shot but the faces of the boys on the right make me sad. I mean, left. To the right of Michelle. Who seems to be having a great time! Unaware of the psychological damage she\u2019s inflicting.\n\nJason: You know what? I think the boy in the purple shirt is like, \u201cOMG I would prefer to be doing anything else right now,\u201d and his arms are all wrong, but the fact that he\u2019s actually working on placing his hands and fingers in just the right way belies a secret interest in this.\n\nAna Marie: I think he worries he\u2019s going to get graded.\n\nJason: The other kid is just \u201cNope.\u201d The girl in the third row, who ends up sort of being dead center in the shot, is straight killing it.\n\nAna Marie: Yes. Other kid is, in his mind, already doing other things. Okay I am charmed by getting-hands-right kid now. I have a backstory for him in my head that includes him taking Bollywood dancing classes in secret and then busting out the moves at prom. AND EVERYONE JOINS IN AND THAT, MY FRIENDS, IS MY MOVIE PITCH.\n\nJason: OMG that\u2019s actually a good fucking movie pitch I would watch the shit out of that.\n\nAna Marie: It would star the guy teaching the class as purple shirt\u2019s Bollywood Miyagi.\n\nJason: Maybe FLOTUS can cameo.\n\nAna Marie: Music by Cornershop!\n\nJason: OMG WHAT IF THIS MOVIE IS HAPPENING AND THIS IS A PICTURE OF IT?\n\nAna Marie: WHAT IS REAL ANYMORE!?!?!? Speaking of which\u2026\n\nAna Marie: We\u2019re through the looking glass, Jason.\n\nJason: I can\u2019t believe Pete Souza hadn\u2019t gotten this shot before! He was probably like, \u201cHow have I never gotten this shot before!\u201d Pete Souza is the Nicolas Cage of photographers.\n\nAna Marie: I don\u2019t know if you noticed the bust in the shot\u2026ahem\u2026 IT\u2019S LINCOLN.\n\nJason: I noticed it, and then I didn\u2019t want to have noticed it, and then I stopped being able to conjugate verbs! Pete Souza forces one into a new sort of Foucauldian conditional subjunctive.\n\nAna Marie: This is an image that conspiracy theorists in 2073 will be using to find lost messages in the Affordable Care Act. In \u201cNational Treasure 15: Secrets of the Death Panels!\u201d\n\nJason: Nicolas Cage discovers an ACTUAL RISK CORRIDOR.\n\nAna Marie: DFOGJADSLKFGLKSADF\n\nJason: \u201cI want to feel like I am the basketball, Bill.\u201d\n\nAna Marie: I don\u2019t know if I have a joke, it\u2019s just weird to see Obama as the short guy. It gives the image a much more plaintive feel.\n\nJason: Also weird to see Obama as the guy with the least amount of grey hair.\n\nAna Marie: Do you think he\u2019s whispering, \u201cHelp me with my jump shot, Bill? I need help.\u201d\n\nAna Marie: See, I like these. They seem really in love, not the strange loyalty/intertwined ambitions but sure, also love of the Clintons. The First Couple are clearly still very hot for each other. It\u2019s one of the most appealing things about them. Probably inappropriate to put it as \u201cfuck like bunny rabbits.\u201d But I suspect they do.\n\nJason: Like very dignified bunny rabbits.\n\nAna Marie: There is only one caption for this, and it would be Sasha rolling her eyes.\n\nAna Marie: Michelle is starring in her own musical here. (ALSO PUPPIES.)\n\nJason: Is this a scene of Michelle Obama on the last day of Barack\u2019s term in office? I mean, she is gonna party so hard when she finally gets to leave DC.\n\nAna Marie: I dunno, I sort of see this as her busting out the version of the \u201cFame\u201d theme song that she sings in the shower. \u201cI feel it comin\u2019 together / People will see me and cry. Fame! / I\u2019m gonna make it to heaven /Light up the sky like a flame. Fame!\u201d And then she picks up a puppies and whirls around.\n\nJason: All those puppies are bonkers cute, my god.\n\nAna Marie: OMG I have that jacket! Which is cute too but not puppy cute or anything.\n\nAna Marie: Is it just me or are there a lot more photos with kids in the Souza portfolio these days? Is that a reflection on who\u2019s left that\u2019s still excited to be around Obama?\n\nJason: They are definitely the only demographic still excited to be around Pete Souza. I think this is a thing we\u2019ve talked about? But after reading so many accounts where Obama talks about how the part of his life where he could experience a degree of anonymity is over, I suspect that children remind him of a time where people he encountered were honest with him.\n\nAna Marie: I bet he likes being around Bo and Sunny a lot more for that reason as well. Though dogs aren\u2019t honest so much as blindly loyal. Which, on second thought, might make him *more* uncomfortable nowadays.\n\nAna Marie: Some of the captions these days are pretty awesome: \u201cChief of Staff Denis McDonough throws a football in the air as the President met with senior staff in Denis\u2019s office to discuss the federal government shutdown and debt ceiling deadline. That football got a lot of use during meetings in September and October.\u201d That\u2019s so\u2026 tantalizing! \u201cThat football got a lot of use during meetings in September and October\u201d! Use as\u2026 what, exactly? Because that\u2019s another children\u2019s book/porn divide.\n\nJason: Didn\u2019t we see the football in the early days of the Flickr feed?\n\nAna Marie: Maybe it\u2019s filled with scotch.\n\nAna Marie: Souza, just fucking with everyone now: \u201cThe President is literally framed through the arm of Chief of Staff Denis McDonough\u201d\n\nJason: OMG, it\u2019s still not \u201cLITERALLY.\u201d Fuck you, Pete Souza!\n\nAna Marie: I have never seen Pete Souza laugh maniacally but I imagine he does a lot. A LOT.\n\nJason: He knows what he did wrong.\n\nAna Marie: OH NOES! REALITY INTRUDES ON THE SOUZAIAN LAND OF PUPPIES AND FOOTBALL. The caption reads: \u201cThe faces of others give an indication of the President\u2019s mood at the conclusion of a meeting to discuss the problems associated with enrollment in the Affordable Care Act.\u201d And I guess Obama\u2019s own expression is TOO TERRIBLE TO BEHOLD? I feel like this could be a scene in a Bond movie, where the henchman have to report back to Blofeld.\n\nJason: Right, and Blofeld says something to the effect of, \u201cYou have one day to report back to me that the plan is proceeding, or that will be your last report to me.\u201d They leave, and Blofield strokes his cat.(The cat in this scenario is Joe Biden.) And Ron Fournier writes a column about what a great leader Blofeld is.\n\nAna Marie: And Biden purrs contentedly.\n\nJason: SO CONTENTEDLY.\n\nAna Marie: It\u2019s also true that Biden purrs contentedly most of the time.\n\nJason: Biden is like the cat who found the one patch of sun to lay in.\n\nAna Marie: Most VPs see the job as a booby prize. Biden sees the booby.\n\nAna Marie: Hey, Obama, trying desperately to recapture that feeling of not having the whole weight of the world on his shoulders!\n\nJason: True fact. The two people I can confirm they know by name at that Taylor Gourmet sandwich place are Barack and me.\n\nAna Marie: Tobias Funke is out of frame, I guess? I can say with some certainty that Bill Clinton has never blued himself.\n\nJason: Did you see that weird princess in a bubble?\n\nAna Marie: You mean Mike Allen?\n\nAna Marie: \u201cSOON.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "by Ana Marie Cox And Jason Linkins \u00b6\n\nThe State of the Union is tonight, and so here are The Guardian\u2019s Ana Marie Cox and Huffington Post political writer \u2026", "title": "Our State Of The Union \u2014 The Awl", "og": {"site_name": "Medium", "description": "by Ana Marie Cox And Jason Linkins \u00b6\n\nThe State of the Union is tonight, and so here are The Guardian\u2019s Ana Marie Cox and Huffington Post political writer \u2026", "title": "Our State Of The Union \u2014 The Awl", "url": "https://theawl.com/our-state-of-the-union-ce086b9bc8e6", "image": "https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/0*apgCHWfAkL42TvQl.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "always", "twitter": {"label1": "Reading time", "image": {"src": "https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/0*apgCHWfAkL42TvQl.jpg"}, "site": "@Medium", "data1": "10 mins", "app": {"url": {"iphone": "medium://p/ce086b9bc8e6"}, "name": {"iphone": "Medium"}, "id": {"iphone": 828256236}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "The Awl", "al": {"web": {"url": "https://theawl.com/our-state-of-the-union-ce086b9bc8e6"}, "android": {"url": "medium://p/ce086b9bc8e6", "app_name": "Medium", "package": "com.medium.reader"}, "ios": {"url": "medium://p/ce086b9bc8e6", "app_name": "Medium", "app_store_id": 828256236}}, "fb": {"app_id": 542599432471018, "smart_publish": {"robots": "noauto"}}, "theme-color": "#000000", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/medium", "published_time": "2014-01-28T22:00:10.000Z", "author": "https://theawl.com/@TheAwl"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "He was probably like, \u201cHow have I never gotten this shot before!\u201d Pete Souza is the Nicolas Cage of photographers.\nJason: OMG that\u2019s actually a good fucking movie pitch I would watch the shit out of that.\nPlus, Pete Souza is now the guy all the White House correspondents hate!\nJason: They are definitely the only demographic still excited to be around Pete Souza.\nOur State Of The Unionby Ana Marie Cox And Jason LinkinsThe State of the Union is tonight, and so here are The Guardian\u2019s Ana Marie Cox and Huffington Post political writer Jason Linkins to judge America through the lens of the White House\u2019s Flickr feed and its tireless photographer, Pete Souza."}
