Over the past decade, private equity in emerging markets hasn’t generated the kind of blockbuster returns investors might expect in exchange for risk and illiquidity.

However, for those investors craving something slightly less correlated to developed markets, private equity in emerging markets may well be the way to go, at least compared with public equities.

Through Dec. 31, Cambridge Associates LLC’s emerging markets index, which is comprised of 445 private equity and venture capital funds, outperformed a public market counterpart, the MSCI Emerging Markets index, over the one and three year terms, as well as a 10-year and 20-year time frame.

In the past five years, the S&P 500 has outstripped emerging markets public equities, as well as private equity in emerging and developed markets.

Emerging markets private equity didn’t experience the kind of rollercoaster that plagued their public counterparts during the first part of 2014. As noted last week, fundraising and investment for emerging markets private equity is on track to match 2013 totals.

There is good reason: Emerging markets private equity returns have hovered in the low double digits, certainly nothing to sniff at considering compressed yields from bonds.

Additionally, emerging markets-focused private equity funds returned more money than they invested during 2013, the first year since 2005 in which distributions outpaced contributions, according to Cambridge.

Similar to the U.S., so-called capital calls, in which a private equity firm draws committed capital from its investors to fund a deal, declined and distributions rose during 2013 throughout emerging markets.

According to Cambridge, emerging markets private equity firms called down some $14 billion for 2013, down $2.3 billion from 2012. Distributions increased 72% to $14.3 billion.
