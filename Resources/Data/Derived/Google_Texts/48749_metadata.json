Also set to go live soon is a $27 million, 4,500-square-foot clinic in southwest Denver.\n\nGonzalez said he was not pressured to leave, but was retiring for personal reasons.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nGonzalez joined Denver Health as CEO in the fall of 2012, helping to guide the health system through the early years of the Affordable Care Act. However, in a recent interview with the Denver Business Journal, Gonzalez acknowledged difficulties making ends meet with a patient base that is only 10% privately insured, the Denver newspaper reported.\n\nRecently, Gonzalez has also had to contend with the departure of some key employees of Denver Health, including the chief of surgery CMO.\n\nThe announcement comes just weeks after the CMIO of New York City Health + Hospitals resigned, citing problems with the implementation of an Epic EHR. The health system\u2019s CEO, Ramanathan Raju, later denied he was under pressure to meet an April 1 launch date.\n\nDenver Health\u2019s former CIO, Gregory Veltri, resigned in October 2013 over concerns that implementing Epic\u2019s EHR could cost the health system $300 million, Becker\u2019s said. Gonzalez disputed that estimate, saying it was within its $170 million budget.\n\nIn 2014, Epic posted the largest net increase of new hospitals among nine vendors reviewed by KLAS.\n\nRecommended Reading\n\nBecker's Hospital Review: Denver Health CEO resigns amid major health system initiatives, physician exodus\n\nDenver Business Journal: Denver Health CEO stepping down during time of turbulence at hospital\n\nHealthcare Dive: NYC Health + Hospital\u2019s CEO denies City Hall pressure on Epic launch\n\nHealthcare Dive: Epic, athenahealth only vendors to gain EHR market share with no losses in 2014", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Meg Bryant", "twitter": {"domain": "Healthcare Dive", "site": "@healthcaredive", "card": "summary"}, "featured": "False", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/cache/c8/8a/c88a1b98837136dbe6caf5f3418406f8.jpg", "sailthru.tags": "healthcare,type-newspost,healthcare-health-it,healthcare-hospital-admin", "news_keywords": "Health IT,Hospital Administration,Hospital Admin", "category": "News Post", "title": "Denver Health CEO's departure coincides with $175M Epic EHR rollout", "pub_date": "apr 01, 2016", "section": "news", "sailthru.date": "2016-04-01T22:39:36", "content_boost": 4, "touched": "True", "article_date_original": "Friday, April 01, 2016, 10:39 PM", "medium": "news", "description": "Healthcare", "sailthru.expire_date": "2026-03-20T22:39:36", "teaser": "<p>CEO Arthur Gonzalez stated he&nbsp;was retiring for personal reasons but has previously&nbsp;acknowledged difficulties making ends meet with a patient base that is only 10% privately insured.</p>", "sponsored": "False", "date": "2016-04-01", "sailthru.description": "CEO Arthur Gonzalez stated he\u00a0was retiring for personal reasons but has previously\u00a0acknowledged difficulties making ends meet with a patient base that is only 10% privately insured.", "viewport": "width=986", "og": {"site_name": "Healthcare Dive", "description": "CEO Arthur Gonzalez stated he\u00a0was retiring for personal reasons but has previously\u00a0acknowledged difficulties making ends meet with a patient base that is only 10% privately insured.", "title": "Denver Health CEO's departure coincides with $175M Epic EHR rollout", "url": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/news/denver-health-ceos-departure-coincides-with-175m-epic-ehr-rollout/416660/", "image": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/diveimage/Denver.jpg", "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "aN-77CvDv8Rt4OQnHMaUSm6V87TF8ri5GDUv93p7pHk", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/cache/84/06/840623ddb95124cb89e014ec7b75033b.jpg"}, "article_summary": "In April, the health system is set to launch a $175 million Epic EHR system.\nRecommended ReadingBecker's Hospital Review: Denver Health CEO resigns amid major health system initiatives, physician exodusDenver Business Journal: Denver Health CEO stepping down during time of turbulence at hospitalHealthcare Dive: NYC Health + Hospital\u2019s CEO denies City Hall pressure on Epic launchHealthcare Dive: Epic, athenahealth only vendors to gain EHR market share with no losses in 2014\nDive Insight:Gonzalez joined Denver Health as CEO in the fall of 2012, helping to guide the health system through the early years of the Affordable Care Act.\nThe announcement comes just weeks after the CMIO of New York City Health + Hospitals resigned, citing problems with the implementation of an Epic EHR.\nRecently, Gonzalez has also had to contend with the departure of some key employees of Denver Health, including the chief of surgery CMO."}
