The Kansas Highway Patrol is on the scene investigating a fatal plane crash in Barton County.

Troopers were called to the scene around 11:30 a.m. Sunday on the report of a plane crashing in a field near NW 30 Ave and NW 40 Road, northwest of Great Bend. A witness saw plane flying low over NW 30th, one mile east of crash site and said it looked like the pilot was trying to gain altitude.

The witness turned away for a moment, only to hear the plane get closer and then saw it crash. The Pottier P70 single-engine went down in a field around 200-300 yards from the road.

The two people on board died at the scene. The Kansas Highway Patrol have been identified them as 49-year-old Roger Brining of Great Bend and a 29-year-old Daniel Bishop of Clearfield, Utah.

The NTSB will be taking over the investigation.
