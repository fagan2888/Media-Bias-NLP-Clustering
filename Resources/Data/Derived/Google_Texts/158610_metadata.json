The one who makes sure one food doesn\u2019t touch another. The diner who blanches at the sight of anything green.\n\nIn my family, it\u2019s my father, the quintessential meat-and-potatoes guy. Serve him a slab of meat and a side of potatoes, and dinner is gold.\n\nDress it up with a sauce or mix it together with other ingredients, and he will politely, but firmly, leave it untouched.\n\nBut even he has exceptions. As a hunter and fisherman, he will eat anything wild. There have been more than a few discussions at the dinner table about this logic. Elk, duck, halibut and venison all work for him. Asparagus and broccoli, onions and mushrooms, not so much.\n\nWhich may be why, in my childhood years, my mother rarely looked beyond the big three vegetables. Corn, peas or green beans rounded out every meal. Then again, those menus predated the surplus of fruit and vegetable choices we have today, so perhaps I can\u2019t blame Dad and his quirks entirely for the simple nature of dinner so many years ago.\n\nDespite these mealtime limits \u2014 or perhaps because of them \u2014 my siblings and I will eat anything set before us. More to the point \u2014 and here my father would shudder \u2014 we search out new flavors and experiences. Raw fish? Plantains? Cassoulet? Bring them on.\n\nBut as I said, there\u2019s one in every crowd. Years later, when I gathered my own brood around the table, one child stood out, and not because he was a hearty eater. Yes, that picky gene had hit the next generation. Although the family was fed a varied diet driven by my recipe testing \u2014 one of the perks of having a food writer as head cook \u2014 he froze at the sight of anything new. Or green. Or mixed together.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s simply a different kind of burger,\u201d I would sigh as I served up a slice of meatloaf. He would pick out the onions, one by one, then scrape off the tomato sauce. As for his sisters, they ate everything.\n\nOn occasion, he would glance curiously at a hitherto-untasted food that someone had on a plate. \u201cThat looks kind of good,\u201d I remember him saying as he noticed a toasted bagel, slathered in butter. But he couldn\u2019t bring himself to try it.\n\nWe as parents like to think that we\u2019re in charge at mealtime. That if we prepare a tasty, healthful meal, our family members will be grateful and eat every morsel and, well, lavish a little praise on us, too. I mean, we\u2019re dreaming here, so let\u2019s go all the way.\n\nAs new parents, we\u2019re sure we can develop good eaters with a few simple culinary tricks, just as we\u2019re unwavering in our belief that we can shape our kids into straight-A students or super athletes or whatever the goal may be by simply following some prescribed Rules of Good Parenting.\n\nThere\u2019s no reason not to try, especially when it comes to feeding our children well. Their health and future adult eating patterns depend on it.\n\nBut the truth is kids come with their own personalities. Sometimes our plans work; sometimes they do not. At least not on our timetable.\n\nJust out of high school, my son worked at an Asian restaurant, where he scooped up fried rice and chicken with broccoli for hungry diners. Only a few weeks into the job, he brought me a sample. \u201cHave you ever tried chicken and broccoli? It\u2019s really good,\u201d he said with delight.\n\nAh, yes. Experience. That first bite of chicken and broccoli, so much more enticing from the commercial wok than at the family dinner table, led to more experimentation over the next few years \u2014 some of it quite bold \u2014 that involved onions, broccoli and Sriracha sauce. On his own, the picky eater had evolved into not-so-picky. Today he eats and cooks \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 just about everything.\n\nBut as I\u2019ve said, there\u2019s one in every crowd, and the next one in the family is pint-size. My preschool granddaughter picked up where her uncle left off. From the day she was born, she had a mind of her own, which wasn\u2019t interested in food, much less variety. Her concerned mother kept a diary of the child\u2019s daily food intake, an effort that seemed a bit extreme to me until I took over as baby sitter for a week. \u201cHow does this child survive?\u201d I thought.\n\nThen along came a new sister. This butterball of energy loved food from her first day. We wonder if there is anything this toddler won\u2019t eat with a grin on her face.\n\nThere are all sorts of good reasons to feed your kids well and to offer a variety of new foods that, eventually, they will hopefully like.\n\nIt\u2019s the \u201ceventually\u201d that can hang us up.\n\nOne of the rare foods I avoided over the years was mackerel, which did not appeal to me for some reason I no longer remember. On a recent trip to Japan with food journalists, I found that, by default, I ate mackerel every day for more than a week. This wasn\u2019t planned on my part, but the fish appeared on the plate. I was a guest and couldn\u2019t say no.\n\nMuch to my surprise, on my return home, I kept thinking about that mackerel. And wanting another taste.\n\nIt\u2019s not only kids who need repetition to get comfortable with a new food.\n\nAs for those really picky eaters, some grow out of it and some do not.\n\nAt the end of the day, when the dishes are done and the crumbs are cleared, we love them both.\n\nFollow Lee Svitak Dean on Twitter: @StribTaste.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "Despite best laid plans to feed our children well, some of them have their own point of view.
