Previously, only the 100 schools with the poorest scores were required to switch to a longer day.\n\nLast school year, 11 Hillsborough schools had a longer school day. Four of them \u2014 Broward, Burney, Dover and Ruskin elementaries \u2014 moved off of the list this year. Seven stayed on the list: James, Just, Oak Park, Potter, Shaw, Sheehy and Sulphur Springs. And 19 were added: Reddick, Kimbell, Bryan, Clair-Mel, Cleveland, Lockhart Magnet, Cypress Creek, Desoto, Dunbar Magnet, Edison, Miles, Mort, Robles, Trapnell, Washington, West Tampa and Witter, along with charter schools Village of Excellence Academy and New Springs Elementary.\n\nWith just 23 percent of its students proficient in reading, Potter Elementary has the 25th-lowest reading scores in the state.\n\n\u2756 \u2756 \u2756\n\nNow, the district is working to secure scheduling, transportation and funding for the initiative with just over three weeks until school starts. District officials met last week with teachers union representatives and school leaders to plan.\n\nSoon, principals will start meeting with their teachers and alerting parents to the changes. Parents of students who scored a Level 5, the top score on the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test, can opt out of the extra hour.\n\nAn updated bell schedule, which works in the extra time at the extended-day schools, will go before the school board for approval Tuesday. Some parents will find that their children\u2019s school day will begin 15 minutes earlier and end 15 minutes later.\n\nMany of the extended-day schools already have 30 minutes of extra reading \u201cintervention,\u201d so teachers and students will only be staying at school for an additional half-hour each day.\n\nSchool board member Candy Olson said she wished the Florida Department of Education had let the district know which schools would be on the list earlier. The list, along with school grades, was released July 11.\n\n\u201cI think more time is always great,\u201d Olson said. \u201cBut I think the state is woefully ignorant of the fact that we start making plans before the school year ends. We will do it, but it\u2019s just a scramble.\u201d\n\nAll of the Hillsborough schools on the list were deemed a C or lower by the state last school year, and the majority of students are not reading on grade level.\n\nAt Sulphur Springs, almost all of the students are eligible for free or reduced-priced lunch, based on income level.\n\nTeachers there find that many students start kindergarten already behind, Principal Scardino said. For many, it\u2019s the first time they\u2019ve been in a classroom setting.\n\nFor two years, all teachers taught the extra hour of reading at the same time each day. But last school year, Scardino decided to stagger the schedule, allowing the resource teachers and reading specialists to rotate from classroom to classroom to help out. This helped improve the school\u2019s grade, she said.\n\nHillsborough Deputy Superintendent Jeff Eakins said the district is encouraging schools to stagger the extra reading like Sulphur Springs did.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve asked the schools to do is make sure that hour is put in there so those specialists can get around to first, second and third grade students,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir time would be maximized.\u201d\n\nDuring the extra hour, teachers will give mini lessons on specific reading skills, such as vocabulary, fluency and phonics. Additionally, schools are encouraged to integrate technology into that time.\n\n\u201cOur teachers use data to look at areas of strength and weakness,\u201d Scardino said. \u201cWe really use every minute of the day for instructional time.\u201d\n\nSwitching to a longer school day was an adjustment for teachers and students at first, she said. But teachers, who were pressed for time before, welcomed the extra time they were given to work with their students, Scardino said.\n\n\u2756 \u2756 \u2756\n\nIn addition to tacking 60 minutes onto the school day at the 24 traditional schools, more reading instruction will be worked into after-school programs three days per week for students who aren\u2019t reading on grade level and the school year will be extended into the first four weeks of summer break next year.\n\n\u201cWe can give them all kinds of time in the year, but if we don\u2019t have those weeks in the summer, students may lose some of that momentum,\u201d Eakins said. \u201cThat\u2019s going to help ease the learning loss.\u201d\n\nFunding an extra hour of school at those schools will cost the district an estimated $350,000 each, which brings the total cost to $8.5 million, Chief Finance Officer Gretchen Saunders said. That money will come out of the budgets for supplemental academic instruction budget and reading comprehension.\n\nAs the district did not receive extra money to pay for the initiative, the curriculum and instruction department is working to shift things around to accommodate those costs, which include paying for teachers and staff to stay an extra hour every day.\n\nThe supplemental academic instruction budget covers things such as academic after-school and summer programs.\n\n\u201cWe have to balance it very carefully,\u201d Eakins said. \u201cThat particular budget is very critical for all of our schools. We have to be careful how we maintain support at all schools.\u201d\n\nAt Clair-Mel Elementary, another school on the list, 34 percent of the 615 students are considered to be proficient in reading. Like Sulphur Springs, Clair-Mel bumped its D grade up to a C this year. There, students will start school 15 minutes earlier and get out 15 minutes later.\n\nPrincipal Rick Grayes said 30 extra minutes were already built into the school\u2019s schedule.\n\n\u201cMany of our teachers already arrive earlier and stay later,\u201d Grayes said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a major thing for their schedule. Plus, now they get some compensation for it, which is a positive.\u201d\n\nGrayes said the additional school time will help.\n\n\u201cWe know our students have challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cOur goal has always been to accelerate the learning. We\u2019re going into the year on a high note.\u201d\n\nekourkounis@tampatrib.com\n\n(813)259-7999\n\nTwitter: @ErinKTBO", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sat, 26 Jul 2014 21:06:11 -0400", "Description": "TAMPA \u2014  For the past several years at Sulphur Springs Elementary, teachers and students have worked on reading for an extra hour every day in the hopes that the school\u2019s low reading sc", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "TAMPA \u2014  For the past several years at Sulphur Springs Elementary, teachers and students have worked on reading for an extra hour every day in the hopes that the school\u2019s low reading sc", "title": "26 schools to add extra hour of reading", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/news/education/26-schools-to-add-extra-hour-of-reading-20140726/", "image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/staticimage/images/new_og_icon.png", "height": 200}, "updated_time": "2014-07-26T21:06:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "26 schools to add extra hour of reading"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2014-07-26T21:06:11Z-04", "modified_time": "2014-07-26T21:06:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3817\"", "article_summary": "Hillsborough Deputy Superintendent Jeff Eakins said the district is encouraging schools to stagger the extra reading like Sulphur Springs did.\n\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely the extra reading that helps,\u201d Principal Julie Scardino said.\n\u201cIt is so helpful to us.\u201dSulphur Springs is one of 26 schools across Hillsborough County required by the state to add an hour of reading instruction to the school day this year.\n\u2014 For the past several years at Sulphur Springs Elementary, teachers and students have worked on reading for an extra hour every day in the hopes that the school\u2019s low reading scores would improve.\nLast school year, 11 Hillsborough schools had a longer school day."}
