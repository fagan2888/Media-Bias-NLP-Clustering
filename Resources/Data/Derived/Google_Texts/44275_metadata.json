Which? tests six juicers, including one for \u00a339\n\nIf you want to fit whole apples into your juicer, check the width of the chute before you buy\n\nA great juicer will be easy to use and make smooth, delicious juice. However, it's easy to spend over \u00a3100 on a juicer, so can you save by buying a cheap model that does a decent job?\n\nWe\u2019ve pitted an Asda model for \u00a339 against pricier models from brands such as Braun and Tefal. Our tests reveal whether a small investment can still result in tasty, freshly made juice or whether you need to splash out on a pricier model.\n\nWe can reveal that there are new Best Buys in the latest batch. To find out if they are pricey or cheap models, and to see the full results of our latest juicer testing, go to juicer reviews.\n\nAsda juicer\n\nThis cheap juicer is easy to use and quite quick, too. While these are good features to have, it\u2019s the quality of the juice that makes this either a good juicer or a poor choice.\n\nThis Asda juicer doesn\u2019t have the widest of feeding chutes, which means you have to cut your fruit or veg into smaller pieces than you do with some other juicers. The Braun juicer, for example, is wide enough to fit in small apples without chopping them up.\n\nBest and worst juicers\n\nA great juicer will not only extract all the juice out of fruit, it will also be able to handle veg. Most raw veg is hard and fibrous, so needs more power for smooth processing. A good juicer will also be easy to use, easy to clean and quick.\n\nPoor juicers struggle with tougher ingredients like veg, and are also a nightmare to clean. If you buy one of these, the chances are that before too long it will be relegated to the back of the cupboard.\n\nLook out for juicers that have parts that are dishwasher safe or that come with tools to help clean filters and mesh attachments.\n\nNew juicer reviews\n\nBelow is a list of all of the recently tested models.
