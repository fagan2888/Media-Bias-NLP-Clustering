With no end in sight to the stalemate, researchers at WalletHub, a personal finance resource, found that red states could be affected more than blue states.\n\nWalletHub researchers considered these factors:\n\nPhoto: Reuters\n\n-- States with the highest concentration of federal employees and the most significant federal contracts; and\n\n-- Places where there are large numbers of people in groups that have either lost or stand to lose key federal funding. For example: students, small business owners, senior citizens and veterans.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nWalletHub found that the states that voted Republican in the 2012 presidential election could take a harder hit than Democrat-voting states if the shutdown, which has halted \"nonessential\" services provided by the federal government, continues.\n\nHere\u2019s the top 25 of WalletHub\u2019s breakdown of most and least affected states.
