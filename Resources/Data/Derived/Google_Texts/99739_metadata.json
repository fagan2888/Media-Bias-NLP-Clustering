The second part can be seen here.\n\nEstakio Beltran grew up in foster care, moving between more than a dozen placements, four different high schools, and many different towns in Washington state\u2019s Yakima Valley.\n\nNow he\u2019s trying to add another Washington address to his travels. It\u2019s a couple thousand miles away.\n\nBeltran is the sole Democratic Party-backed congressional candidate in Central Washington, which covers the same area in which he shuttled from home to home. He is currently running against 11 other candidates for the first open seat in the district since 1995.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a better way to practice for this type of situation rather than to have been raised the way I was raised,\u201d Beltran said.\n\nBeltran, now 30, entered the foster care system as a teenager because his family was unable to care for him. Years of instability made it difficult for Beltran to make friends and maintain good grades. But with the help of teachers, mentors and advocates, he was able to graduate Davis High School in 2001 and get accepted to Gonzaga University the following fall.\n\nAttending Gonzaga gave Beltran a new start.\n\n\u201cIt was the first time in my life where it didn\u2019t matter,\u201d Beltran said. \u201cNo one wanted to know about parents as a freshman, they just wanted to know your dorm number or major and stuff like that.\u201d\n\nHis past would come back to visit him during school breaks. While his peers went home to their families, he spent his time sleeping in shelters or his car, and lied to his friends about where he would go.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until his junior year that Beltran came to grips with his foster care experience.\n\n\u201cIt took a while for me to come to terms that it wasn\u2019t my fault,\u201d he said. \u201cI felt like for years people were telling me that something was broken with me, and that was why I was put into foster care.\u201d\n\nEventually he began to tell his friends and peers his story. This led to people opening their homes to him for school breaks, and an eventual trip to Washington D.C., where he took the time to meet with his state representatives and talk about issues of foster care.\n\n\u201cNot many people from Washington state, since it\u2019s on the other side of the country, would come to D.C.,\u201d he said. \u201cSo probably even less foster youth would go.\u201d\n\nBeltran realized his calling was in politics when he looked deeper into Title IV-E, a federal entitlement program that helps fund state and local foster care systems. This includes funds for daily care and supervision, training of foster care staff and recruitment of foster parents.\n\n\u201cI just saw chapters and chapters of my life,\u201d he said of the federal laws. \u201cEach of those pages was a story. Yet nobody who had written that text knew. The authors were disconnected from the end consumer because of how it was written.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnce I saw that, I knew there was a responsibility that I had to really get in there to make a difference.\u201d\n\nIn 2005, Beltran began working with Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA) in her D.C. office, and in 2007, he began working with Congressman Dennis Cardoza (D-CA). There he worked as a Senior Legislative and Child Welfare Policy Advisor and was a liaison to the Hispanic Caucus.\n\nHe even had a part in introducing the first bill that would extend Medicaid up until age 21 for foster youths, though the bill died in the Washington Senate.\n\n\u201cThere is a big problem with foster youth who lost health care coverage at midnight when they turned 18,\u201d he said about the issue. \u201cWhen you go from over-prescribed psychotropic medications to nothing at all, most people will spiral out of control. And this is often the case because the medications are too expensive to afford without Medicaid.\u201d\n\nHe remembers a hearing where the speaker staff was talking about extending coverage for people who are under their parents\u2019 plans until they were 26. \u201cI thought, how about those who don\u2019t have parents?\u201d\n\nWith that question, some more policy pushing and the work of many other people, Beltran played a small part in the Affordable Care Act\u2019s inclusion of foster youth health care coverage up until 26, which began this year.\n\nBeltran is currently running for a seat in the U.S. Congress where, if elected, he will represent over 650,000 people. His focus will be on research to spur job creation, to improve access to higher education for youth, and to create trade schools and training for those in the predominantly rural areas who are looking to take on more technical careers.\n\nMoving around frequently gave Beltran the opportunity to meet many different people and families in the area. This experience, he feels, gives him the skills to be able to live and work with many different types of people.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so lucky that I was raised by families all over the district,\u201d Beltran said. \u201cI really got a chance to understand the district I\u2019m running for. I\u2019m in a place where I\u2019m the product of the district I\u2019m running for.\u201d\n\n\u201cI survived foster care,\u201d Beltran added. \u201cRunning for congress? This is nothing. I\u2019m running in complete faith over what I believe in. Running with conviction that this is my home and I am the best person to represent it. Once you have that, all the other stuff is nothing.\u201d\n\nHis first chance to face his 11 opponents will come soon. The Washington League of Women Voters will host a congressional debate on July 10.\n\nVictor Valle is a reporter at the Chronicle of Social Change.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Chronicle of Social Change", "description": "This story is the first part of a series about former foster youth who are now working to change policy.
