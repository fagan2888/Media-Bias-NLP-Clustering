Although there has been a large amount of looting and rioting in the town, there have also been incidents captured on film of peaceful protesters being confronted by police in full riot gear using tear gas and rubber bullets.\n\nMr. Lynch said he saw one photo of a police sniper set up atop an armored vehicle, watching the protests.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s an image I won\u2019t soon forget,\u201d he said.\n\nPolice forces are increasingly receiving training from members of the military, which Mr. Lynch said was very troubling because the two groups have two very separate roles.\n\nThe military is used internationally when there has been a conscious decision to use lethal force. They are focused on completing the mission and are \u201cnot thinking about constitutional rights on the other side of a battlefield,\u201d he said.\n\nBut in a country where people are innocent until proven guilty, police officers should do just the opposite and always be thinking about a suspect\u2019s rights.\n\n\u201cWe want the police to avoid the use of force, and then use the very minimum use of force that may be required to bring a suspect into a court of law,\u201d Mr. Lynch said.\n\nThe laws of the United States still apply to the police, he said, something that separates America from authoritarian regimes. But when an officer steps out of line, prosecutors and police leaders must be ready to punish the wayward officer, not try to sweep the issue under the rug.\n\nPolice forces use to keep special teams \u2014 like SWAT \u2014 for only certain dangerous situations like hostage crises, Mr. Lynch said. But now those teams are getting involved in more routine operations and regular police patrols.\n\n\u201cWe use to refer to police officers as \u2018peace officers\u2019 in this country, but with the para-militarism, we\u2019re starting to get the opposite,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t look like police officers to us. They look like soldiers who are getting ready for battle.\u201d\n\nPeople think that SWAT teams barging into homes in the middle of the night may be an occasional event, but it\u2019s actually much more common than many believe, Mr. Lynch said, adding that it is common for officers to barge into the wrong address.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re also throwing flash bang grenades into the windows of these raids and sometimes there are tragic consequences,\u201d he said.\n\nHe pointed to an incident in May where a flash bang was thrown into a house without warning and landed in a baby\u2019s crib, seriously injuring the child who, at last report, is still in a coma.\n\nThe mother said that she wasn\u2019t allowed to see how badly her son might be wounded, as police officers handcuffed her and took her out of the house.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Police forces around the United States are militarizing at an alarming rate, often without the knowledge of those who pay them, a criminal justice expert said Friday.", "Author": "Phillip Swarts", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Police forces around the United States are militarizing at an alarming rate, often without the knowledge of those who pay them, a criminal justice expert said Friday.", "title": "Police militarizing with few checks on power, expert says", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/aug/23/police-militarizing-without-any-checks-power-exper/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/08/23/ferguson-ap-photo.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/08/23/ferguson-ap-photo.jpg", "title": "Police militarizing with few checks on power, expert says", "description": "Police forces around the United States are militarizing at an alarming rate, often without the knowledge of those who pay them, a criminal justice expert said Friday.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "War Conflict, Tim Lynch"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfeee\"", "article_summary": "Mr. Lynch said he saw one photo of a police sniper set up atop an armored vehicle, watching the protests.\nPolice forces around the United States are militarizing at an alarming rate, often without the knowledge of those who pay them, a criminal justice expert said Friday.\nPolice forces use to keep special teams \u2014 like SWAT \u2014 for only certain dangerous situations like hostage crises, Mr. Lynch said.\nPolice forces are increasingly receiving training from members of the military, which Mr. Lynch said was very troubling because the two groups have two very separate roles.\n\u201cThey\u2019re also throwing flash bang grenades into the windows of these raids and sometimes there are tragic consequences,\u201d he said."}
