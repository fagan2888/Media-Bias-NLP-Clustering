Tim Murphy (R-Pa.) is attempting to unite mental health advocates around his plan to reshape the nation\u2019s treatment and prevention systems, vowing to work with those who \u201care mired in the old ways.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are so disjointed that we have become the Jerry Springer family,\u201d Murphy said at an event hosted by the Treatment Advocacy Center. \u201cWe have to stop being self-serving here, folks, and start serving those in need.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMurphy, who is trained as a child psychologist, said he plans to reintroduce his bill in the next few weeks \u201cafter we do some other polishing and tinkering on this.\u201d\n\nHe said he believes the bill will reach the Senate, with Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) taking the lead with support from Sens. Roy Blunt Roy BluntSenators hope for deal soon on mental health bill Cruz: VA secretary 'should resign' Overnight Defense: VA chief 'deeply' regrets Disney remark; Senate fight brews over Gitmo MORE (R-Mo.), Chris Murphy Chris MurphyOvernight Healthcare: Momentum on mental health? | Zika bills head to conference | Only 10 ObamaCare co-ops left Senators hope for deal soon on mental health bill Overnight Healthcare: IRS doubted legality of ObamaCare payments, ex-official says MORE (D-Conn.) and Lisa Murkowski Lisa MurkowskiSenators float bipartisan wildfire bill Overnight Energy: Lawmakers closing in on chemical safety deal GOP chair pushes Obama official on Arctic drilling plan MORE (R-Alaska).\n\nThe legislation, \u201cHelping Families in Mental Health Crisis Act,\u201d was authored in early 2013 in the wake of the deadly elementary school shooting in Newtown, Conn.\n\nThe bill would create new, strict guidelines for state governments, including a controversial provision that makes it easier to require people with severe mental illnesses to seek treatment and take medication.\n\nMurphy slammed the billions of dollars spent by the federal government on mental health, which he said was based on a \u201ctake my word for it\u201d accountability model.\n\n\u201cWe are on something of a fool\u2019s errand in doing this in a way that\u2019s not done well.\u201d\n\nHe also condemned the government\u2019s main agency for mental illnesses, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMSA). He compared its most recent budget request to the chaos in the 1978 comedy \u201cAnimal House.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is an agency that doesn\u2019t deserve to continue to be the same thing,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir record\u2019s a failure.\u201d\n\nMurphy\u2019s bill had won support from Republican leadership in Congress, who painted the bill as the GOP\u2019s solution to the nation\u2019s intensifying mental health crisis. But the bill\u2019s path forward came into question last session, after the House Energy and Commerce Committee decided to break it in pieces to improve its chances of passage.\n\nAdvocates say the nation is facing a crisis. As the nation\u2019s healthcare system has shifted away from large mental institutions, many people with mental illnesses are faced with two options: jail or the emergency room.\n\nThirty-four states cut mental health spending between 2009 and 2011 \u2014 a total of $1.6 billion \u2014 at a time when the demand for mental health services surged across the country, according to the National Alliance on Mental Illness.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Rep.
