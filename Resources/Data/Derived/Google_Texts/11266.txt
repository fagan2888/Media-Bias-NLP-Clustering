"We will work to ensure these necessary steps pose as few disruptions to travelers as possible."

Fliers headed back to the United States who let electronic devices lose their charge risk having them confiscated, after the Transportation Security Administration announced today that it not allow cell phones, laptops and other devices onto planes at undisclosed overseas airports if they could not be turned on.

The TSA today posted a statement from Homeland Security Director Jeh Johnson describing the new policy, which is intended to reduce the risk that explosives disguised as electronic devices will make it onto aircraft.

"I have directed TSA to implement enhanced security measures in the coming days at certain overseas airports with direct flights to the United States," the statement read. "We will work to ensure these necessary steps pose as few disruptions to travelers as possible. We are sharing recent and relevant information with our foreign allies and are consulting the aviation industry."

Johnson spoke briefly about the new policy during an appearance this morning on NBC's "Meet the Press," when he told host David Gregory that there was no plan at present to implement the policy at U.S. airports.

"The screening we have right now domestically, from one domestic airport to the other, is pretty robust, as the American traveling public knows. In this instance, we felt that it was important to crank it up some at the last point of departure airports. And we'll continually evaluate the situation."
