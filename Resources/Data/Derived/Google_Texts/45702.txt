Chuck Todd, host of Meet the Press, took a look at the issues that could face the biggest changes during the upcoming election.

Sunday With: Chuck Todd

Health care

“The future of the Affordable Care Act and how we access and pay for health care is on the ballot,” Todd says.

Immigration

“The next president will decide whether there’s a path to citizenship for undocumented folks.”

The Supreme Court

“As Congress and the executive branch get more divided, the Supreme Court has become more and more involved in solving political disputes. They’re redistricting, they’re taking up immigration, they’re going to take up health care. And half of them are over the age of 70. So the makeup of the Supreme Court is on the ballot, which therefore can touch issues you don’t even know you’re concerned about.”
