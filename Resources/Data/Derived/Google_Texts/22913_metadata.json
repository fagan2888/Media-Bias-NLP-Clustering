Inside looks like a doctor\u2019s office with a reclining exam chair and anatomical charts. You only know that it\u2019s not a traditional office when it shakes as people get on and off.\n\nCynthia Louis comes to this free mobile health clinic about twice a month to work with Doctor Fred Anderson and various medical students on mitigating the constant aching in her joints.\n\nLouis is one of the 850,000 Floridians in the health care \u201ccoverage gap\u201d\u2014she earns too little to get help buying health insurance under the Affordable Care Act but doesn\u2019t qualify for Medicaid.\n\nClick here to listen to the audio version of this story.\n\nWithout Medicaid\n\nOver the past two years, Dr. Anderson has seen Louis try to piece together health care for herself without insurance.\n\n\u201cHer case is a very telling case study of how so many of our individuals who are taxpaying, contributing members of our society [are] continuing to fall through the cracks,\u201d says Anderson, \u201cand despite our best efforts they are not getting the best care that they really deserve.\u201d\n\nAnderson runs Florida International University\u2019s three mobile health clinics, which pairs FIU medical students with a low-income family for the duration of their time at the school.\n\nWhen Louis can\u2019t afford the $25 dollar co-pay to see her primary care doctor at Jessie Trice Community Health Center, she comes here to the Neighborhood HELP program. Through this program, she also gets mental health counseling, legal advice and social services.\n\nWhile the program is free, Louis has to open her life to all kinds of case managers, counselors and doctors.\n\nAnd at first, she says that bothered her, \u201cbut then I saw them trying to help me. [Because] I don't know a lot of people, I don\u2019t know a lot of things [and] they helped me.\u201d\n\nFor someone who\u2019s uninsured, Louis has put together what you could consider Cadillac care.\n\nShe is in the charity care program though the county\u2019s public hospital, Jackson Health System, which gives her deeply discounted services. When she can\u2019t scrape together the co-payments, she has the free clinic through FIU. Also she uses coupons for medications and she\u2019s a persistent advocate for her care.\n\nEven all that, though, does not afford her the same level of care Medicaid would.\n\n\u201cI do not feel satisfied with how we've been able to really get her on her feet,\u201d says Anderson, \u201cbecause ultimately even if we do ask her to get additional x-rays she certainly can't afford them, she certainly just tells us that, 'look I can't do it this month, maybe next month.'\u201d\n\nWhen the pain started, Louis had to quit her job at Burger King and now she doesn\u2019t work.\n\nWith no income, she has to pay $40 for X-rays, $33 for the dentist and a few dollars for each medication, of which she\u2019s on at least nine. That puts a big strain on her finances.\n\nCare Or No Care?\n\nLouis now spends a lot of her time with her 78-year-old mother, Cassie Stuckey, who has a heart condition.\n\n\u201cShe can\u2019t do what she want to do, she can\u2019t work, she can\u2019t clean the house, she ain't able to do nothing for herself no more,\u201d says Stuckey. \u201cThat\u2019s a knock to your knees.\u201d\n\nThis particular Monday afternoon, Louis and Stuckey sit at the kitchen table and peel eggs, about two dozen in a giant pot. Later, they\u2019ll sell these to kids coming back from school for 25-cents apiece. Money will be used to pay for medications.\n\nFor her and so many other Floridians, it\u2019s not just about the quality of health care. It\u2019s about whether or not to get health care at all. Deciding whether to spend the money they do have to get X-rays, medications, or see a doctor.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like asking nobody for no money,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause I know they got their own problem. And I just do without.\u201d\n\nLouis has still not gotten the X-rays her doctor asked her to get over a month ago, but she\u2019s saving up for an appointment with a rheumatologist in July.\n\nWLRN is a part of Health News Florida, which receives support from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.", "article_metadata": {"category": "News", "description": "This is the third part in our series, Falling Into The Gap, in collaboration with the Miami Herald.
