With less than two weeks remaining before the March 31 deadline for coverage this year, five million people have already signed up. After decades of rising percentages of Americans lacking health insurance, the uninsured rate has dropped to its lowest levels since 2008.\n\nMeanwhile, health care costs have slowed dramatically. The new law may well be contributing to this slowdown by reducing Medicare overpayments to medical providers and private insurers, and creating incentives for hospitals and doctors to improve quality of care.\n\nSome of the confusion has been deliberately sown by outside groups that, in the wake of \u201cCitizen\u2019s United,\" have been free to spend large amounts of money to undermine the law.\n\nBut a lot about the Affordable Care Act needs fixing \u2013 especially the widespread confusion and misinformation that continues to surround it. For example, a majority of business owners with fewer than 50 workers still think they\u2019re required to offer insurance or pay a penalty. (In fact, the law applies only to businesses with 50 or more employees who work more than 30 hours a week). And many companies with fewer than 25 workers still don\u2019t realize that if they offer plans they can qualify for subsidies in the form of tax credits.\n\nMany individuals remain confused and frightened. Forty-one percent of Americans who are still uninsured say they plan to remain that way. They believe it will be cheaper to pay a penalty than buy insurance. Many of these people are unaware of the subsidies available to them. Signups have been particularly disappointing among Hispanics.\n\nSome of this confusion has been deliberately sown by outside groups that, in the wake of the Supreme Court\u2019s \u201cCitizen\u2019s United\u201d decision, have been free to spend large amounts of money to undermine the law. For example, Republican Gov. Rick Scott of Florida told Fox News that the Affordable Care Act was \u201cthe biggest job killer ever,\u201d citing a Florida company with 20 employees that expected to go out of business because it couldn\u2019t afford coverage.\n\nNone of this is beyond repair, though. As more and more Americans sign up and see the benefits, others will take note and do the same. The biggest problem on the horizon that may be beyond repair \u2013 because it reflects a core feature of the law \u2013 is the public\u2019s understandable reluctance to be forced to buy insurance from private, for-profit insurers that aren\u2019t under enough competitive pressure to keep premiums low.\n\nBut even here, remedies could evolve. States might use their state-run exchanges to funnel so many applicants to a single, low-cost insurer that the insurer becomes, in effect, a single payer. Vermont is already moving in this direction, and California may be next. In this way, the Affordable Care Act could become a back door to a single-payer system \u2013 every conservative\u2019s worst nightmare.\n\n\n\nJoin Opinion on Facebook and follow updates on twitter.com/roomfordebate.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"thumbnail_75": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2014/03/20/opinion/RFDAccordableCARE/RFDAccordableCARE-thumbStandard.jpg", "twitter": {"image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2014/03/20/opinion/RFDAccordableCARE/RFDAccordableCARE-thumbWide.jpg"}, "communityAssetTaxonomy": "opinion/roomfordebate/obamacares-four-year-checkup", "applicationName": "shell", "PT": "blogs", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2014/03/20/opinion/RFDAccordableCARE/RFDAccordableCARE-thumbWide.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "thumbnail_75_width": 75, "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2014/03/20/opinion/RFDAccordableCARE/RFDAccordableCARE-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "States might use their state-run exchanges to funnel so many applicants to a single, low-cost insurer that the insurer becomes, in effect, a single payer.
