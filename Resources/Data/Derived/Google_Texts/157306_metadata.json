Dobson and Family Talk object specifically to providing coverage for abortion drugs and devices.\n\n\u201cThe government shouldn\u2019t be able to punish Americans for exercising their fundamental freedoms,\u201d said Senior Legal Counsel Matt Bowman. \u201cAny government willing to force a family-run Christian ministry to participate in immoral acts under the threat of crippling fines is a government everyone should fear.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur ministry believes in living out the religious convictions we hold to and talk about on the air,\u201d added Dobson, Family Talk\u2019s founder and president. \u201cAs Americans, we should all be free to live according to our faith and to honor God in our work. The Constitution protects that freedom so that the government cannot force anyone to act against his or her sincerely held religious beliefs. But the mandate ignores that and leaves us with a choice no American should have to make: comply and abandon your religious freedom, or resist and be fined for your faith.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit, Dobson v. Sebelius, filed with the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado, argues that the mandate violates the Religious Freedom Restoration Act as well as the First and Fifth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution.\n\nAlliance Defending Freedom attorneys and allied attorneys are also litigating numerous other lawsuits against the mandate. The lawsuits represent a large cross-section of Protestants and Catholics who object to the mandate.\n\nOn the same day the Supreme Court announced it would take Hobby lobby\u2019s case to dismantle the HHS mandate that forces religious companies and groups to pay for birth control and abortion-causing drugs, two pro-life organizations released a new poll showing 59 percent of Americans oppose the mandate.\n\nFamily Research Council and Alliance Defending Freedom released the results of a commissioned national survey showing that 59 percent of likely voters \u201coppose the mandate requiring the coverage of preventive care services for women which includes all FDA approved contraceptives, including drugs that can destroy a human embryo, and sterilization services without a direct cost to the patient.\u201d\n\nCLICK LIKE IF YOU\u2019RE PRO-LIFE!\n\nThe latest Rasmussen Reports national telephone survey finds that 38% of Likely U.S. Voters still believe businesses should be required by law to provide health insurance that covers all government-approved contraceptives for women without co-payments or other charges to the patient. Fifty-one percent (51%) disagree and say employers should not be required to provide health insurance with this type of coverage. Eleven percent (11%) are not sure.\n\nThe US Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) has issued a call for prayer and fasting for religious freedom on the Fridays of Advent this year.", "article_metadata": {"description": "James Dobson Files Lawsuit Against Obamacare's HHS-Abortion Pill Mandate", "og": {"site_name": "LifeNews.com", "description": "Alliance Defending Freedom attorneys filed a federal lawsuit Tuesday against the Obama administration on behalf of Dr. James Dobson and his \u201cFamily Talk\u201d ra", "title": "James Dobson Files Lawsuit Against Obamacare\u2019s HHS-Abortion Pill Mandate", "url": "http://www.lifenews.com/2013/12/11/james-dobson-files-lawsuit-against-obamacares-hhs-abortion-pill-mandate/", "image": "http://www.lifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/dobsn2-e1368733726380.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 204509779594999}, "OBKey": "avejq02j7xRr+0owuq+Pcw==", "keywords": "james dobson,lawsuit,obamacare,abortion,hhs,pill,mandate,alliance defending freedom", "google-site-verification": "PPPx-GD0i7nWjUFAYnFdOYorAAJLuNyKOl23JCeXyrQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The US Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) has issued a call for prayer and fasting for religious freedom on the Fridays of Advent this year.\nThe lawsuit challenges the legality and constitutionality of the mandate, which requires religious employers to provide insurance coverage for abortifacients, sterilization, and contraception to employees regardless of religious or moral objections.\nAlliance Defending Freedom attorneys filed a federal lawsuit Tuesday against the Obama administration on behalf of Dr. James Dobson and his \u201cFamily Talk\u201d radio show and ministry, a Christian non-profit organization that is currently subject to Obamacare\u2019s abortion pill mandate.\nDobson and Family Talk object specifically to providing coverage for abortion drugs and devices.\nFifty-one percent (51%) disagree and say employers should not be required to provide health insurance with this type of coverage."}
