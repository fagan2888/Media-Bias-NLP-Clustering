But the National Hispanic Leadership Agenda said those whom Mr. Obama has freed from the danger of deportation should be considered \u201clawfully present for all purposes, including eligibility for public benefits and affordable health care.\u201d\n\nSEE ALSO: Obamacare opens door for inmates to get taxpayer-funded Medicaid: study\n\n\u201cNHLA asks that you apply the fairness and equality that your Administration has shown in various other areas in the health care context and ensure that no one \u2014 regardless of their immigration status \u2014 lacks access to critical health care services,\u201d Hispanic leaders said in their letter.\n\nNearly 600,000 illegal immigrants had been approved for tentative legal status under what the administration labeled Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA). Their status means they cannot be deported for two years from the time of their approval, and they can apply to renew that status every two years.\n\nThey have also been given work permits. Most states have also decided to allow them driver\u2019s licenses.\n\nSEE ALSO: White House: Obama doesn\u2019t want immigration reform to be \u2018casualty\u2019 of election\n\nImmigrant rights activists have asked Mr. Obama to expand his deferred action program to include illegal immigrants who are parents of U.S. citizen children and parents of dreamers. If Mr. Obama were to follow through on that as part of his promised executive action after this year\u2019s elections, it could mean potentially millions more people eligible for Obamacare.\n\nRosemary Jenks, government relations manager for NumbersUSA, which fights for a crackdown on immigration, said there is a bright dividing line that determines who should be eligible for taxpayer-funded health care benefits.\n\n\u201cAs soon as Congress votes to change the law and allow illegal aliens to become legal, then those aliens will have access to U.S. benefits. But it\u2019s very clear taxpayers are not in favor of that, which is why Congress has not passed it,\u201d she said.\n\nA Rasmussen Reports poll released earlier this month shows just how deep that opposition runs.\n\nThe poll found 71 percent of voters opposed giving services to the illegal immigrant children who surged across the border this summer, and 63 percent of the voters surveyed said that a generous social welfare system in the U.S. draws illegal immigrants here.\n\nDuring the 2009 and 2010 debates over Obamacare, immigrant rights advocates fought for access for illegal immigrants but ran into opposition from both the White House and Democrats in Congress, who didn\u2019t want the issue sinking the entire health care law.\n\nImmigrant rights advocates, though, say the legal situation for those illegal immigrants who have been granted forms of tentative legal status is different. Indeed, they said the law actually would allow dreamers to get health care, but the Obama administration changed its own policies to stop it.\n\nBefore Mr. Obama\u2019s June 2012 policy for dreamers, others who had been granted deferred action on their deportations had been eligible for publicly funded health care benefits, according to the National Latina Institute for Reproductive Justice.\n\nBut in August 2012 the administration issued new guidance saying dreamers wouldn\u2019t be eligible \u2014 in essence creating yet another category of tentative legal status that was eligible for just a subset of rights to which other immigrants are entitled.\n\nMr. Obama had planned to take action extending his nondeportation policies this summer but backed off, fearing a backlash from voters. Now the White House has said he will act after Election Day, when voters can no longer punish him or his party.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Top Hispanic leaders asked President Obama last week to grant some illegal immigrants access to Obamacare, saying the \"dreamers\" to whom the White House has given tentative work permits are already paying taxes, so they deserve government benefits.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Top Hispanic leaders asked President Obama last week to grant some illegal immigrants access to Obamacare, saying the \u201cdreamers\u201d to whom the White House has given tentative work permits are already paying taxes, so they deserve government benefits.", "title": "Hispanics want Obamacare for illegal immigrant \u2018dreamers\u2019", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/oct/12/hispanics-want-obamacare-for-illegal-immigrant-dre/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/02/22/b8d83ba99b159a074c0f6a7067006027.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/02/22/b8d83ba99b159a074c0f6a7067006027.jpg", "description": "Top Hispanic leaders asked President Obama last week to grant some illegal immigrants access to Obamacare, saying the \"dreamers\" to whom the White House has given tentative work permits are already pa", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Hispanics want Obamacare for illegal immigrant \u2018dreamers\u2019"}, "Author": "Stephen Dinan", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Social Issues, White House"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda70f\"", "article_summary": "Immigrant rights advocates, though, say the legal situation for those illegal immigrants who have been granted forms of tentative legal status is different.\nNearly 600,000 illegal immigrants had been approved for tentative legal status under what the administration labeled Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA).\nUnder government policy, illegal immigrants are barred from buying insurance on Obamacare\u2019s exchanges, and about half the states also prohibit them from getting Medicaid benefits.\nMr. Obama had planned to take action extending his nondeportation policies this summer but backed off, fearing a backlash from voters.\nIf Mr. Obama were to follow through on that as part of his promised executive action after this year\u2019s elections, it could mean potentially millions more people eligible for Obamacare."}
