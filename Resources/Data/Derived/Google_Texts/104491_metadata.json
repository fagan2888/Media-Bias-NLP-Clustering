Mike Pence\u2019s statewide expansion of Medicaid under President Barack Obama\u2019s health care overhaul.\n\nThe measure was approved on a 65-35 vote Thursday. It now goes to Pence\u2019s desk.\n\nIndiana\u2019s expansion of Medicaid is called the Health Indiana Plan, or HIP 2.0 for short. It has extended health insurance to thousands of people who didn\u2019t previously have it. A waiver granted by the federal government allows the state to charge fees to low-income people for coverage.\n\nLawmakers also are expected to vote Thursday on a multimillion plan to boost state and local road funding. The deal also is expected to include an extra $42 million for regional economic grants.\n\nThursday is this legislative session\u2019s planned adjournment day.\n\nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press.
