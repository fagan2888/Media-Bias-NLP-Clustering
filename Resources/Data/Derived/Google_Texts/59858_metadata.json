Others still weren\u2019t sure whether they were covered, despite their best efforts to navigate the often-balky new system.\n\nThe major benefits of President Barack Obama\u2019s health care overhaul took effect Wednesday, the first day of 2014. By Thursday, the first business day of the new insurance system, it became clear that snags in the rollout of the Affordable Care Act still remained.\n\nOn the plus side, the law\u2019s protections mean consumers can no longer be denied coverage if they\u2019re in poor health. New limits on how much insured patients must pay for care will mean fewer bankruptcies after catastrophic illnesses. Insurance plans must offer a minimum level of essential benefits, and care such as flu shots and mammograms will be fully covered without cost to patients.\n\nBut early problems with the federal HealthCare.gov website led many people to wait until last week to sign up, and insurers are still processing enrollment forms.\n\nPaperwork problems almost delayed suburban Chicago resident Sheri Zajcew\u2019s scheduled surgery Thursday, but Dr. John Venetos decided to operate without a routine go-ahead from the insurance company. That was after Venetos\u2019 office manager spent two hours on hold with the insurer Thursday, trying to get an answer about whether the patient needed prior authorization for the surgery. The office manager finally gave up.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a happy camper,\u201d said Nate Zajcew, the patient\u2019s husband. The couple signed up for a Blue Cross Blue Shield bronze plan through the federal HealthCare.gov site on Dec. 16. \u201cI understand it\u2019s just a matter of paperwork and yesterday was a holiday. I can be an SOB, too, at times, but since they\u2019re going on with the procedure, it\u2019s OK.\u201d\n\nVenetos, a Chicago digestive system specialist, described \u201ctremendous uncertainty and anxiety\u201d among patients calling his office recently. Some thought they\u2019d signed up for coverage but hadn\u2019t received insurance cards yet. Others had insurance policies that were canceled and weren\u2019t sure if their coverage had been reinstated after Gov. Pat Quinn decided to allow one-year extensions of canceled plans.\n\nVenetos said he has decided to take a risk and provide care for these patients, at least until there\u2019s less confusion about coverage.\n\n\u201cWe feel it\u2019s the right thing to do,\u201d Venetos said. \u201cWe may end up stuck holding the bag and not getting paid on these claims.\u201d\n\nBlue Cross Blue Shield of Illinois, which has the most customers in the state\u2019s individual market, has been adding staff and extending call center hours to keep up with demand. \u201cEvery week we\u2019re adding staff to our call centers and we\u2019re also enhancing our call routing features to better serve our customers,\u201d said spokesman Greg Thompson.\n\nIn the southern Illinois city of Benton, 61-year-old Nancy Pace spent part of New Year\u2019s Day calling Blue Cross Blue Shield to make certain she and her husband were covered by the silver plan they chose on the troubled federal insurance website. \u201cWhen you get to where it says \u2018Pay for your policy,\u2019 well, that button doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Pace said.\n\nCalling the insurance company worked: Pace paid and got her member number over the phone.\n\n\u201cI made a phone call. I pushed the right button and got a live person,\u201d she said.\n\nPace, a stroke survivor, said she hasn\u2019t had good insurance since her husband lost his job when the mining machinery plant where he worked closed in 2005. The Affordable Care Act means better health care for her and her husband, she said, but she has doubts.\n\n\u201cMy biggest concern is, how long is this going to last? How long can our country bear this expense?\u201d Pace said. \u201cIt\u2019s a benefit for us right now. But I don\u2019t see how it can possibly be sustainable. \u2026 Am I going to use it? You bet I am. For one thing, it\u2019s a law. I don\u2019t have a choice.\u201d\n\n(\u00a9 Copyright 2014 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.
