The Roosevelt Park Activity Pool will be the site of end-of-summer dog swimming from 4 to 7 p.m. Tuesday, Aug. 19, and 4 to 7 p.m. Wednesday, Aug. 20.

The city of Longmont has said that "all friendly dogs are welcome" but that no "people swimming" will be permitted. Admission is $3 per dog, and people are expected to pick up after their pooches.

The dog swims come after the closing of the Roosevelt Activity Pool to the general public. Pool chemicals will have been neutralized as part of the pool's winterization process, so the water is safe for dogs.
