It says its source declined to be named as the investment was not yet public.\n\n\n\nGoodyear is expected to announce the investment at a joint event with the government on Friday, April 24, in Mexico City. A company spokesman, Eduardo Arguelles, declined to comment.\n\n\n\nThe investment \u201ccomes shortly after automakers Toyota, Ford and Volkswagen unveiled major expansion plans in Mexico, taking advantage of Mexico's low wages, free trade agreements and proximity to the United States,\u201d according to the story.\n\n\n\nLast week, \u201cToyota said it would spend $1 billion on a passenger car plant, and Ford said it would spend $2.5 billion on engine and transmission operations,\u201d Reuters notes. \u201cGerman Volkswagen said last month it will invest about $1 billion to expand its vehicle assembly plant in Mexico's Puebla state.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nBuyers' outlet\n\nReal estate agents always say it\u2019s a great time to buy a house. In Cleveland, that really is the case \u2014 at least according to a report from Zillow.\n\n\n\nCNNMoney.com reports that Zillow found the top U.S. housing markets for buyers are Philadelphia, Chicago and Cleveland. In these markets, \u201cinventory tends to be strong and homes stay on the market longer and often experience price cuts, which gives buyers more bargaining power,\u201d the website reports.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnward and upward\n\nMiami-Fort Lauderdale, Providence, Detroit and Pittsburgh also made the list.\"There is a definite feeling that things are easing,\" said Skylar Olsen, a senior economist at Zillow, tells CNNMoney.com. \"We are heading toward better balance. Buyers will be able to take a little more time this year compared to last year.\"The story notes that tight inventory throughout the country helped push home prices up 4.5% in January from the year prior, according to the S&P/Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index. But homes in the top 10 buyers' markets \u201care selling for nearly 4% less than the list price on average, according to the Zillow report. In sellers' markets, buyers get an average discount of less than 1%.\u201d\n\nThe planned closure of Lakewood Hospital is one of the examples cited in this Kaiser Health News story about hospitals packing up in poor areas and moving to wealthier ones.\n\n\n\n\u201cHospitals have followed population migrations before, but relocations \u2026 are becoming more common,\u201d according to the story. \u201cThat's partly due to the aging of many facilities built decades ago, as well as the desire to attract better-paying patients.\u201d\n\n\n\nSuch hospital relocations are currently planned or underway in southern Illinois; south and central Florida; eastern Tennessee; central Georgia; Birmingham, Ala.; and Northeast Ohio, Kaiser Health News reports.\n\n\n\nLakewood Hospital, managed by the Cleveland Clinic, is slated to close in 2016. As Kaiser Health News puts it, \u201cPatients will be directed to the Clinic's newer Fairview Hospital three miles away or to another facility being built in Avon, 13 miles away. Both Fairview and Avon are higher-income towns.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe story notes that hospital officials \u201coften say it is cheaper to build, rather than renovate, their mostly downtown facilities. What they don't say publicly is how geography often determines a hospital's economic destiny, especially at a time of increasing financial pressure as a result of Medicare funding cuts, including penalties that may result from new pay-for-performance measures in the Affordable Care Act.\u201dBy moving to wealthier areas, Kaiser Health News reports, \u201chospitals can reduce the share of uninsured and lower-paying Medicaid patients, while increasing the privately insured. That's also why they locate outpatient centers and medical offices in affluent suburbs.\u201dBut relocations \u201coften spark anger from those left behind, who worry about the loss of jobs and of access to care,\u201d the story notes.In the short term, at least, Lakewood will take a financial hit , so it\u2019s up to city leaders to make the most of a planned wellness campus and whatever economic development they can muster at the hospital site.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou also can follow me on Twitter for more news about business and Northeast Ohio.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui", "description": "The Akron company plans to spend $550 million on a tire plant in Mexico that will begin operations in 2017 and will produce tires primarily for the domestic market, Reuters reports.
