If only people better understood it, if only those in power found better ways to explain it, he says, perhaps they\u2019d be feeling more positive about his record in office.\n\nLast week, journalist Andrew Ross Sorkin sat down with the soon-to-be-retired POTUS, Barack Obama, to discuss his economic legacy and how economic ideas are best communicated to people. Unsurprisingly, he had some really interesting stuff to say.\n\nWhether or not that\u2019s true, we\u2019re psyched he\u2019s thinking along the same lines as us about the need to change the way we communicate about the economy.\n\nHere\u2019s some of our favorite quotes from the piece:\n\n\u201cI mean, the truth of the matter is that if we had been able to more effectively communicate all the steps we had taken to the swing voter\u2026 then we might have maintained a majority in the House or the Senate.\u201d\n\nHe points out that a good story sometimes gets in the way of the facts:\n\n\u201cIf you ask the average person on the streets, \u2018Have deficits gone down or up under Obama?\u2019 probably 70% would say they\u2019ve gone up,\u201d Obama said, with some justifiable exasperation \u2014 the deficit has in fact declined (by roughly three-quarters) since he took office, and polls do show that a large majority of Americans believe the opposite.\n\n\u201cHow people feel about the economy [is influenced by] what they hear.\u201d\n\nAnd underlines just how important the economy is to all our lives:\n\n\u201cOne of the things that I\u2019ve consistently tried to remind myself during the course of my presidency is that the economy is not an abstraction. It\u2019s not something that you can just redesign and break up and put back together again without consequences.\u201d\n\nHere he points out how you cannot really separate economics from politics:\n\n\u201cOne of the constants that I\u2019ve had to deal with over the last few years is folks on Wall Street complaining even as the stock market went from in the 6,000s to 16,000 or 17,000\u2026 They\u2019d be constantly complaining about our economic policies. That\u2019s not rooted in anything they\u2019re experiencing; it has to do with ideology and their aggravations about higher taxes.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama's recent call for a better understanding the economy offers challenge to politicians to communicate economic ideas more effectively.", "og": {"site_name": "Economy", "description": "President Obama's recent call for a better understanding the economy offers challenge to politicians to communicate economic ideas more effectively.", "title": "Barack Obama on board with our mission to get people talking about the economy", "locale": "en_GB", "image": "http://www.ecnmy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/president-obama.jpg", "url": "http://www.ecnmy.org/engage/barack-obama-economy/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "President Obama's recent call for a better understanding the economy offers challenge to politicians to communicate economic ideas more effectively.", "creator": "@EconomyAsks", "image": "http://www.ecnmy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/president-obama.jpg", "title": "Barack Obama on board with our mission to get people talking about the economy", "site": "@EconomyAsks", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "robots": "noodp", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.ecnmy.org/wp-content/themes/economy-theme/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "http://facebook.com/ecnmy", "section": "This Week", "tag": "United States"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3303\"", "article_summary": "Last week, journalist Andrew Ross Sorkin sat down with the soon-to-be-retired POTUS, Barack Obama, to discuss his economic legacy and how economic ideas are best communicated to people.\nThat\u2019s not rooted in anything they\u2019re experiencing; it has to do with ideology and their aggravations about higher taxes.\u201d\nWhether or not that\u2019s true, we\u2019re psyched he\u2019s thinking along the same lines as us about the need to change the way we communicate about the economy.\nThe president talks about breaking up the banks, Obamacare, and jobs \u2013 but what really jumped out was how much he mentions the issue of the language that gets used to explain the economy.\nIf only people better understood it, if only those in power found better ways to explain it, he says, perhaps they\u2019d be feeling more positive about his record in office."}
