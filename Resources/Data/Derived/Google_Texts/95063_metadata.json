They point to the failed rollout of Obamacare as clear proof that a massive bill \u2014 such as the immigration measure that passed the Senate this year \u2014 is the wrong approach and would lead to even greater problems.\n\nHouse Speaker John A. Boehner, Ohio Republican, and others in his party also may feel emboldened to scrap the Senate plan and move forward with smaller, targeted pieces of legislation after a coalition of influential conservative groups urged them Tuesday to do just that.\n\n\u201cThe House of Representatives is in a unique position to propose genuinely conservative solutions to fix our broken immigration system. We, therefore, encourage the House to continue its work to address the different aspects of the immigration issue in a piecemeal basis,\u201d reads a letter signed by the heads of the American Principles Project, the American Conservative Union, Conservatives for Immigration Reform, the Hispanic Leadership Fund and other organizations.\n\nThe groups urged House Republicans to pursue \u201clegal status to undocumented immigrants, but not a special path to citizenship,\u201d a key difference from what the Senate has approved. The groups also called for the establishment of \u201cmarket-oriented mechanisms to meet the demand our economy has for foreign workers.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf President Obama and the Democrats are willing to kill immigration reform in the House because they disagree with these principles, it would show that they are more interested in using the issue politically than actually solving the problem,\u201d the letter said.\n\nWith House action on the Senate bill becoming less likely each day, the president mounted a perhaps last-ditch push to spur Republicans to action and, in turn, give the White House a major victory on one of its key second-term domestic policy initiatives.\n\nAt the end of the government shutdown last month, Mr. Obama identified three challenges \u2014 a long-term budget, immigration reform and a farm bill \u2014 that, he said, realistically could be addressed on a bipartisan basis in the coming months. With a farm bill still in limbo and budget negotiations between House and Senate leaders just getting underway, the president has thrown his full weight behind the push to enact a far-reaching immigration bill and give the administration a badly needed political win.\n\n\u201cAlthough right now there has been some resistance from House Republicans, what\u2019s been encouraging is there have been a number of House Republicans who think this is the right thing to do,\u201d Mr. Obama said just before he met with some of the nation\u2019s top CEOs, including the heads of McDonald\u2019s, Lockheed Martin, Motorola Solutions and Marriott.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my estimation that we actually have the votes to get comprehensive immigration reform done right now. The politics are challenging for the speaker and others. We want to make it as easy for him as possible. This is not an issue where we\u2019re looking for a political win. This is one where we\u2019re looking for a substantive win for the U.S. economy.\u201d\n\nMr. Obama is correct when he speaks of bipartisan support; 14 Senate Republicans supported immigration reform when it passed the chamber over the summer.\n\nIn addition, a handful of House Republicans have signed on as co-sponsors to a House proposal that mirrors the Senate version.\n\nBut amid the troubles with Obamacare and a growing recognition that the White House may have oversold and underdelivered on its health care reform legislation, House Republicans have a new argument to sink the Senate plan and instead pass smaller measures.\n\n\u201cIf the president is insisting on one massive, Obamacare-style bill that people don\u2019t understand, we aren\u2019t going to get very far,\u201d said Brendan Buck, a spokesman for Mr. Boehner. \u201cThe speaker has made clear publicly and privately that, while it\u2019s important we address immigration reform, the House is not going to consider the Senate plan. Instead, we remain committed to a common-sense, step-by-step approach that gives people confidence immigration reform has been done the right way.\u201d\n\nOpposition to the Senate bill is coming from quarters beyond Capitol Hill and outside the political realm.\n\nAs the president met with the CEOs, the labor union representing Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents wrote a letter to those same business leaders denouncing the plan and calling on the House to make sure it advances no further toward becoming law.\n\n\u201cOnly the U.S. House of Representatives now stands between the American people and the potential destruction of federal immigration enforcement,\u201d said Chris Crane, the union\u2019s president. \u201cYet the groups represented on this letter are spending enormous sums of money or wielding enormous amounts of influence in an attempt to intimidate the House into passing a plan similar to that adopted by the Senate.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama on Tuesday summoned leading CEOs to the White House to showcase support for a broad immigration reform package, telling Republicans that the business community's position should make it \"easy\" to get the measure through the House.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "President Obama on Tuesday summoned leading CEOs to the White House to showcase support for a broad immigration reform package, telling Republicans that the business community\u2019s position should make it \u201ceasy\u201d to get the measure through the House.", "title": "Obama aims to make it \u2018easy\u2019 for GOP to back immigration reform", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/nov/5/obama-aims-make-it-easy-gop-back-immigration-refor/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2012/11/05/obama-2012_live.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2012/11/05/obama-2012_live.jpg", "description": "President Obama on Tuesday summoned leading CEOs to the White House to showcase support for a broad immigration reform package, telling Republicans that the business community's position should make i", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama aims to make it \u2018easy\u2019 for GOP to back immigration r"}, "Author": "Ben Wolfgang", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Social Issues, House, Senate, White House"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda0ed\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIt\u2019s my estimation that we actually have the votes to get comprehensive immigration reform done right now.\n\u201cThe speaker has made clear publicly and privately that, while it\u2019s important we address immigration reform, the House is not going to consider the Senate plan.\nPresident Obama on Tuesday summoned leading CEOs to the White House to showcase support for a broad immigration reform package, telling Republicans that the business community\u2019s position should make it \u201ceasy\u201d to get the measure through the House.\nIn addition, a handful of House Republicans have signed on as co-sponsors to a House proposal that mirrors the Senate version.\nThis is one where we\u2019re looking for a substantive win for the U.S. economy.\u201dMr. Obama is correct when he speaks of bipartisan support; 14 Senate Republicans supported immigration reform when it passed the chamber over the summer."}
