According to Modern Healthcare, \u201cinexcusable\u201d was their mantra, in reference to a series of actions taken by HHS during the unveiling of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.\n\nPrior to the hearing, it became clear that no one at HHS wanted to join the table with Gruber, the reputed \u201carchitect\u201d of Obamacare. Last week, Politico reported Jim Esquea, assistant secretary for legislation at HHS, made a request to the committee, asking \u201cthat Administer Tavenner be provided the opportunity to testify on a panel comprised solely of government witnesses.\n\n\u201cExecutive Branch officials are almost always afforded an opportunity to testify on a panel either alone or with other government witnesses.\u201d Gruber was the only other witness scheduled to appear before the committee, although Gruber and Tavenner were being summoned to testify on separate issues.\n\nGruber\u2019s characterizations of Obamacare in the media has caused HHS and the Obama Administration to distance themselves from him, with the President recently referring to him as \u201can adviser who was never on our staff,\u201d according to Politico.\n\nBefore the House committee, Gruber issued a profuse apology, as Rep. Darrell Issa issued accusations of creating a false model that was part of \u201ca pattern of intentional misleading\u201d by the Administration to get the ACA enacted, according to Fox News.\n\nIssa told Gruber, \u201cYou made a series of troubling statements that were not only an insult to the American people, but revealed a pattern of intentional misleading [of] the public about the true impact and nature of Obamacare.\u201d\n\nIn his apology, Gruber said, despite his earlier comments asserting that a lack of transparency helped get the law enacted, he does not believe that the ACA was passed in a \u201cnon-transparent fashion,\u201d and went on to express regret for his \u201cglib, thoughtless and sometimes downright insulting comments,\u201d according to Fox News. \u201cI sincerely apologize for conjecturing with a tone of expertise and for doing so in such a disparaging fashion. I knew better. I know better. I'm embarrassed and I'm sorry.\u201d\n\nInvoking what became something of a mantra at the hearing, Gruber admitted that he \u201cbehaved badly\u201d but that \u201cmy own inexcusable arrogance is not a flaw in the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nThe Committee also attacked Tavenner as head of CMS, in particular alleging that the agency inflated enrollment numbers. Initial assessments from the agency claimed enrollment of 7.3 million; those figures were later reduced to 6.7 million, an action that Issa called an attempt to \u201cdoctor the books\u201d by including dental plan numbers.\n\nTavenner apologized for the confusion over enrollment figures, stating \u201cIt was an inexcusable mistake,\u201d according to Modern Healthcare. \u201cIt should not have happened in the first place.\u201d\n\nWhen Tavenner was questioned regarding the possibility that exchange subsidies could be withdrawn in roughly two-thirds of the states, with Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) asking why exchange customers aren't being informed about that risk when they sign up for coverage, Tavenner replied, \u201cThis is not a closed case, and I'm not going to speculate.
