So-called robo advisers aim to make it simple to invest in a portfolio that is low in cost and also suited to one’s needs and risk tolerance. Users typically fill out a short questionnaire online and then get a suggested portfolio of exchange-traded funds that provide exposure to multiple asset classes.

But investors tempted to try one of these services should be aware that the recommended portfolios can vary widely for a single person, as the Journal found when we looked at robo advisers’ picks for three hypothetical investors. (The services also vary in other ways, including their fees, account minimums and the availability of phone assistance from human advisers.)

As seen in this chart, five selected robos suggested very different mixes of U.S. stocks, international stocks, U.S. bonds, international bonds and other investments for a moderate-risk investor:

There are also more subtle variations within these asset classes— including differing allocations to small stocks and emerging markets and different types of assets used besides standard stocks and bonds.

For readers who want to delve in further, here are the lists of ETFs the five services recommended for our moderate-risk investor:
