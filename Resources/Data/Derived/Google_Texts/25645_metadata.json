The Access Center for Independent Living\u2019s (ACIL) Recycled Equipment Donated for Independence Program (REDI) will give that piece of equipment to someone who needs it.\n\n\u201cA lot of times people can\u2019t afford a hospital bed or a lift chair,\u201d explained Greg Kramer, assistant director of the Access Center. \u201cThe Affordable Care Act requires everybody have insurance, but some insurance doesn\u2019t cover durable medical equipment or even if it does, it may not completely pay for it.\u201d\n\nKramer said a hospital bed may cost several thousand dollars with specialized beds selling for as much as $50,000.\n\nACIL is a non-profit, non-residential center for independent living funded through Title VII of the Rehabilitation Act. At least 51 percent of those on the organization\u2019s board and staff have disabilities.\n\n\u201cOur mission is to ensure that people with disabilities have complete access to the communities in which they wish to live,\u201d Kramer said. \u201cWe do so through offering advocacy, information and referral, independent living skills training, peer support, our recycled durable medical equipment program and through assisting individuals transition from institutional settings to community living.\u201d\n\nOther services include a Traumatic Brain Injury Support Group, a Youth Transition Program and a Disability Awareness Training.\n\nThe REDI program relies on donations of medical equipment in good working condition. Once the item is donated it goes through a cleaning process to make it ready to go back out to someone in need in the community. \u201cThere\u2019s no fee for the item requested, however we do ask if a donation can be made to cover administrate costs,\u201d Kramer said.\n\nHere\u2019s what they need most:\n\nManual wheelchairs\n\nLift chairs\n\nWalkers with seats\n\nHospital beds\n\nScooters\n\nHoyer lifts\n\nBatteries for power wheelchairs and scooters\n\nOther needs\n\nThe group\u2019s Brain Injury(BI) Support Group meets from 2-3:30 p.m. every second Thursday and fourth Tuesday at the Access Center. \u201cWe are the only support group in the area,\u201d said Kramer. \u201cWe are registered with the Brain Injury Association of Ohio (BIAOH) however we do not receive any funding from them since they closed their doors. They now provide website information and referral of support groups in Ohio by county.\u201d\n\nThe purpose of the support group meetings, said Kramer, is to bring hope to the survivors by sharing thoughts and emotions. \u201cWe are starting to include activities that will help stimulate the brain.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s what this group can use:\n\nPainting supplies including canvases, brushes, charcoal pencils\n\nRags and cleaning supplies\n\nDecks of cards (large type)\n\nUno games\n\nClassical Music CDs to play during activities\n\nGardening books\n\nIndoor gardening supplies\n\nDonations to either program can be dropped off between noon and 4 p.m. Monday through Thursday at the Access Center, 1329 Stanley Ave., Dayton.
