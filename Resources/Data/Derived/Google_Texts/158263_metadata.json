The 5,000-member tribe is the largest in California, its 56,585-acre reservation covering a 44-mile stretch of the Klamath River in the northwestern part of the state.\n\n\u201cThe Yurok People have the responsibility to care for our natural world, including the plants and animals we use for our foods and medicines,\u201d Yurok Tribe Chairman James Dunlap said in the statement. \u201cThis Ordinance is a necessary step to protect our food sovereignty and to ensure the spiritual, cultural and physical health of the Yurok People. GMO food production systems, which are inherently dependent on the overuse of herbicides, pesticides and antibiotics, are not our best interest.\u201d\n\nThe move came in direct response to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\u2019s ruling in November that genetically altered salmon is safe to eat and can thus legally be manufactured for consumption.\n\nRELATED: Genetically Engineered Salmon Safe to Eat: U.S. Food and Drug Administration\n\n\u201cGMO farms, whether they are cultivating fish or for fresh produce, have a huge, negative impact on watersheds the world over,\u201d the tribe said. \u201cThe Yurok Tribe\u2019s homeland is on the Klamath River, where massive algal blooms, exacerbated by agricultural runoff and antiquated hydroelectric dams, turn the river toxic each summer.\u201d\n\nThe Yurok had approved a resolution opposing genetically engineered salmon back in April 2013, but this is among the first ordinances passed.\n\n\u201cWhile other tribes, such as the Dine\u2019 (Navajo) Nation, have declared GMO-free zones by resolution, this ordinance appears to be the first of its kind in the nation,\u201d the Yurok said.\n\nRELATED: Standing Against GMOs Is Standing for Sovereignty\n\nThe move is part of a regional collaboration with other tribes under the auspices of the Northern California Tribal Court Coalition (NCTCC) that also includes an upcoming Indigenous Food Sovereignty Summit in Klamath in spring 2016.\n\nUnlike a resolution, an ordinance carries within it mechanisms for enforcement, the Yurok noted.\n\n\u201cIt is the inherent sovereign right of the Yurok People to grow plants from natural traditional seeds and to sustainably harvest plants, salmon and other fish, animals, and other life-giving foods and medicines, in order to sustain our families and communities as we have successfully done since time immemorial,\u201d said Yurok Chief Judge Abby Abinanti in the tribe\u2019s statement. \u201cOur Court will enforce any violations of these inherent, and now codified, rights.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Yurok Tribe has passed a tribal ordinance banning genetically engineered organisms such as GMO corn or altered salmon from its territory.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "theresa", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/12/29/frankenfish-fail-yurok-ordinance-bans-genetically-engineered-organisms-162902", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/uploads/2010/12/09_GM-SALMON-e1292981301217.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Frankenfish Fail: Yurok Ordinance Bans Genetically Engineered Organisms"}, "dcterms.date": "2015-12-29T15:30-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/12/29/frankenfish-fail-yurok-ordinance-bans-genetically-engineered-organisms-162902", "dc": {"title": "Frankenfish Fail: Yurok Ordinance Bans Genetically Engineered Organisms"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 2}, "dcterms.title": "Frankenfish Fail: Yurok Ordinance Bans Genetically Engineered Organisms"}, "article_summary": "The Yurok Tribe has passed a tribal ordinance banning genetically engineered organisms such as GMO corn or altered salmon from its territory.\n\u201cThe Tribal GEO Ordinance prohibits the propagation, raising, growing, spawning, incubating, or releasing genetically engineered organisms (such as growing GMO crops or releasing genetically engineered salmon) within the Tribe\u2019s territory and declares the Yurok Reservation to be a GMO-free zone,\u201d the tribe said in a statement on December 14 after passing the Yurok Tribe Genetically Engineered Organism (\u201cGEO\u201d) Ordinance.\n\u201cThe Yurok People have the responsibility to care for our natural world, including the plants and animals we use for our foods and medicines,\u201d Yurok Tribe Chairman James Dunlap said in the statement.\n\u201cThis Ordinance is a necessary step to protect our food sovereignty and to ensure the spiritual, cultural and physical health of the Yurok People.\nRELATED: Genetically Engineered Salmon Safe to Eat: U.S. Food and Drug Administration\u201cGMO farms, whether they are cultivating fish or for fresh produce, have a huge, negative impact on watersheds the world over,\u201d the tribe said."}
