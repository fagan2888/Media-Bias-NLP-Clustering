Miley Cyrus is having the last laugh, it seems.

In an interview with MTV News conducted last week after her controversial performance at the Video Music Awards, the pop singer declared it had been her plan all along to get people talking. In performing “We Can’t Stop” and “Blurred Lines” with Robin Thicke, Cyrus inflamed the late-summer news cycle with her racially charged dancing (similar to that in a poorly considered video) and raunchy use of a foam finger.

“Me and Robin [Thicke] the whole time said, ‘You know, we’re about to make history right now,'” said Cyrus.
