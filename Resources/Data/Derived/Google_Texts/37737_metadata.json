Failed business ventures. Caustic rhetoric. Unseemly business dealings.\n\nFor months, Republican opponents of Donald J. Trump hit him on myriad issues, to no avail. Now, the \u201csuper PAC\u201d supporting Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign, Priorities USA, is picking up where Republicans left off, with two broadcast ads focusing on Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks about women and a new online ad mocking his business exploits.\n\nTHE AD Over and over, Mr. Trump is interrupted in mid-sales pitch \u2014 for Trump Airlines, Trump University, Trump Steaks, and so on \u2014 with a red rubber stamp declaring \u201cScam,\u201d \u201cFailed\u201d or \u201cFraud.\u201d The bottom line: Far from the business genius he purports to be, Mr. Trump is no better than a \u201ccon man.\u201d\n\nTHE IMPACT His detractors are of two minds about negative ads attacking Mr. Trump: Some believe his victory in the Republican primaries shows that they did not work; others say his exceptionally high unfavorable ratings show that they did. Operatives at Priorities USA say that many voters did not pay much attention to ads during the primary campaign \u2014 so expect to see a lot more.\n\nChanging channels ...\n\nTwo Can Play\n\nEven as Democrats have begun attacking Republican congressional candidates by linking them to their presumptive presidential nominee, the National Republican Senatorial Committee released a brutal new digital ad tying Democratic candidates to Hillary Clinton.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWith a loud heartbeat thumping, the ad shows several Democratic candidates in shadowy, red-and-black photos as a narrator asks if voters can \u201creally support\u201d Mrs. Clinton. It calls her a \u201cliving history of scandal, lies and spin,\u201d citing Whitewater, Benghazi and the investigation into her use of a private email server as secretary of state; says she once defended an accused child rapist and laughed about it; and denounces her for \u201cfake accents, fake concerns and fake laughs.\u201d\n\nSight Gag\n\nPolitical ads have deployed demon sheep and scorpions. Now come adorable kittens, clawing at each other\u2019s backs. The narrator of a Democratic ad attacking Senator Pat Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, sarcastically intones, \u201cYou scratch my back \u2014 I\u2019ll scratch yours,\u201d suggesting Mr. Toomey is beholden to his former colleagues on Wall Street.\n\nNothing to Chance\n\nFacing a closer race than expected, Senator John McCain of Arizona has already begun attacking Representative Ann Kirkpatrick, his Democratic challenger, over her vote for Obamacare.\n\nNumbers\n\n$12.4 million: Amount spent by the Koch brothers\u2019 donor network on Senate contests so far.\n\n10: Number of Republican outside groups that have run ads so far in the Senate race in New Hampshire.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20160521160036, "twitter": {"description": "The Democrats hit Donald J.
