This is just a disaster. Al Qaeda couldn\u2019t have run this worse than the Obama Administration has run Healthcare.gov.\u201d\n\nLaszewski also added that he had been in contact with several insurers, who confirmed the bleak enrollment numbers released by The Wall Street Journal Monday. According to the Journal, less than 50,000 Americans have successfully purchased private insurance through the Healthcare.gov website. Despite the website\u2019s many technical issues, the number represents about one-tenth of the Obama Administration\u2019s initial enrollment target.\n\n\u201cThe numbers the Wall Street Journal reported, 50,000, are accurate,\u201d Lasczewski said. \u201cThey jibe with the numbers I have been hearing. More than that. It\u2019s 50,000 people, but it works out to about 50 people per state per day. Do the math. 30 days, 36 states, 50 people a day\u2026That\u2019s the trickle that\u2019s getting through Healthcare.gov right now. Very, very few people are able to make it through this gauntlet.\u201d\n\nWatch the exchange below.\n\nh/t Mediate\n\n", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "The implementation of Obamacare has been so bad, according to a recent guest on Fox News, that the terrorist organization al Qaeda could have run the program more efficiently.", "title": "[WATCH] Fox News guest claims al Qaeda could've run Obamacare...", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2013/11/Megyn-Kelly-Robert-Laszewski-Obamacare-al-Qaeda-600x333.jpg", "height": 333}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2013/11/12/watch-fox-news-guest-claims-al-qaeda-couldve-run-obamacare-better-than-the-president/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "wall-street-journal", "published_time": "2013-11-12T12:02:51+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-12T16:55:12+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "The implementation of Obamacare has been so bad, according to a recent guest on Fox News, that the terrorist organization al Qaeda could have run the program more efficiently.\n\u201cThe numbers the Wall Street Journal reported, 50,000, are accurate,\u201d Lasczewski said.\nRobert Laszewski, a former insurance executive and the president of Health Policy and Strategy Associates, made that assertion to Fox News\u2019 Megyn Kelly Monday night.\nAl Qaeda couldn\u2019t have run this worse than the Obama Administration has run Healthcare.gov.\u201dLaszewski also added that he had been in contact with several insurers, who confirmed the bleak enrollment numbers released by The Wall Street Journal Monday.\nAccording to the Journal, less than 50,000 Americans have successfully purchased private insurance through the Healthcare.gov website."}
