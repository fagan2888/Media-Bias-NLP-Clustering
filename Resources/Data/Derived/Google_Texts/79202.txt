64 graduates of the University of Iowa College of Nursing lined up Saturday morning to receive their degrees at the Iowa Memorial Union. Sarah Armstrong already knows where she's going.

"I'm going to head back to Rochester, Minnesota and work at Mayo Clinic," Armstrong said.

This is the field she's always wanted to work in. As the last of four kids to graduate in her family, she knows her and her classmates' futures are filled with options.

"A lot of us are going for more education, and then most of us would like to stay back at Iowa, just because we know the program, and we know it's prestigious," Armstrong told us.

This is one of the last 64-student graduations for the College of Nursing, according to Dr. Thad Wilson, executive associate dean. Class sizes are growing to 72, to accommodate an increase in applicants.

"The hospitals and clinical sites are busier and busier and busier," Wilson told us. He said there's more competition to get into this program, but that's helping to cover a nationwide shortage of nurses.

"In the state of Iowa, the average age of a nurse in the 50's, and in the faculty range it's even higher. We're in the high 50's," Wilson explained, adding that the Affordable Care Act has increased the need for nurses to be involved at all levels of care.
