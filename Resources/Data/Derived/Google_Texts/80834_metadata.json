(Planned Parenthood has denied taking any illegal actions.)\n\n\u201cThe only thing Planned Parenthood is entitled to is a federal investigation.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for Planned Parenthood did not immediately return The Daily Signal\u2019s request for comment.\n\nThe following cases were outlined in the report.\n\nAlabama\n\nAccording to the report, a Planned Parenthood affiliate in Mobile did not report the suspected sexual abuse of a 14-year-old girl.\n\nDocuments from the Alabama Department of Public Health show that an affiliate in Mobile did not report suspected abuse to authorities when the 14-year-old received two abortions within four months.\n\n\u201cBased on the review of medical records and the facility\u2019s policy and procedure and interview, the facility failed to follow their own standards,\u201d a report from the Department of Public Health states.\n\nArizona\n\nAccording to the report, Planned Parenthood of Central and Northern Arizona performed two abortions on a 12-year-old girl who was being sexually abused by her 23-year-old foster brother, who brought her to the clinic for the abortions.\n\nThe victim filed a civil lawsuit against Planned Parenthood for failing to report the crime in a timely fashion, which was later settled.\n\nAdditionally, \u201ctwo different Planned Parenthood facilities in Arizona were caught on tape failing to report statutory rape,\u201d the ADF report states.\n\nCalifornia\n\nThe report outlines multiple cases in California where Planned Parenthood did not report suspected abuse.\n\nIn one case, a 13-year-old girl who was sexually abused by her father went to Planned Parenthood for two abortions within 6 months. After the second abortion, instead of reporting suspected sexual abuse, a doctor implanted an intrauterine device in order to prevent additional pregnancies.\n\nThe abuse was uncovered only when the victim\u2019s sister, also a victim of sexual abuse, reported their father to law enforcement. The man was prosecuted for sexually abusing his daughters.\n\nAccording to court papers, one of the girls endured \u201cseven years of sexual abuse\u201d by the father.\n\nColorado\n\nThe ADF report says a 13-year-old girl was brought to a Denver Planned Parenthood clinic by her stepfather for an abortion.\n\nCourt papers reveal that the stepfather, who also wanted the girl to be given a form of birth control she did not want, was sexually abusing her. The girl\u2019s mother later discovered the abuse and reported the perpetrator to law enforcement. She testified that Planned Parenthood did not notify her of her daughter\u2019s abortion, as they are required under Colorado law.\n\nThe man was later incarcerated for his crimes.\n\nAccording to court papers, the civil case against Planned Parenthood was later settled.\n\nConnecticut\n\nAccording to a police report cited by ADF, a kidnapping victim was uncovered in the home of her abductor in 2007.\n\nAfter her discovery, the victim revealed to police that she had been taken to a West Hartford Planned Parenthood clinic for an abortion during her captivity.\n\nMinnesota\n\nA 42-year-old father was found guilty of first-degree criminal sexual conduct for sexually assaulting his son\u2019s 14-year-old girlfriend, according to court papers.\n\nThe perpetrator testified that he had taken the victim to Planned Parenthood for birth control during the course of the abuse.\n\n\u201cWhile the opinion from the criminal case does not indicate anything else about Planned Parenthood, it is evident that no report was made to law enforcement by Planned Parenthood,\u201d the ADF report states.\n\nOhio\n\nThe ADF report outlines several instances in which Planned Parenthood clinics in Ohio did not report sexual abuse.\n\nIn one case, a 16-year-old victim of sexual assault was taken to Planned Parenthood. She informed a Planned Parenthood employee that her father was abusing her, but the employee did not report the assault to law enforcement. She suffered another year and a half of abuse.\n\nThe victim\u2019s civil lawsuit against Planned Parenthood was later settled.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new report chronicles \u201cdecades\u201d of failure to report sexual abuse.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A new report chronicles \u201cdecades\u201d of failure to report sexual abuse.", "title": "Planned Parenthood Has Failed to Report Sexual Abuse", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150903_ADFreport_Scanlon.jpg", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1fZLfc7"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A new report chronicles \u201cdecades\u201d of failure to report sexual abuse.", "title": "Planned Parenthood Has Failed to Report Sexual Abuse", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150903_ADFreport_Scanlon.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "Protecting Life", "published_time": "2015-09-07T18:37:59+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Planned Parenthood, Alliance Defending Freedom, Planned Parenthood videos, pro-life, prolife"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe only thing Planned Parenthood is entitled to is a federal investigation.\u201dA spokesperson for Planned Parenthood did not immediately return The Daily Signal\u2019s request for comment.\nPlanned Parenthood clinics have displayed a pattern of failure to report sexual abuse, according to a report by Alliance Defending Freedom.\nOhioThe ADF report outlines several instances in which Planned Parenthood clinics in Ohio did not report sexual abuse.\nAlabamaAccording to the report, a Planned Parenthood affiliate in Mobile did not report the suspected sexual abuse of a 14-year-old girl.\nThe report chronicles \u201cdecades\u201d of failure to report sexual abuse, ADF Legal Counsel Natalie Decker told The Daily Signal in an interview."}
