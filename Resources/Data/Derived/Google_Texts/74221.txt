Beaver Creek — For more than 20 years, Ingemar Stenmark’s record of 86 World Cup wins was thought to be unbeatable, but Vail’s Lindsey Vonn is becoming a real threat to surpass him.

Vonn, who broke the women’s record of 62 last season, swept two downhills and a super-G this weekend at Lake Louise, Alberta, bringing her total to 70. If she averages 10 wins this season and next in downhill and super-G, which she is very capable of doing if she remains healthy, she will break his record.

In a career spanning 1975 to 1989, Stenmark won 46 giant slalom races and 40 slalom races. The great Swede captured the final victory of his amazing career at Aspen in 1989. Vonn long ago surpassed the No. 2 man on the wins list, Hermann Maier (54).

Vonn, 31, is committed to racing three more seasons because she intends to compete in the 2018 Olympics in South Korea.

Sunday’s race in Lake Louise was notable for another Vail Valley athlete, too. Slalom phenom Mikaela Shiffrin made her World Cup debut in a speed discipline — speed races being downhill and super-G — and finished a highly respectable 15th. Shiffrin’s brother, Taylor, was a forerunner in the men’s giant slalom Sunday at Beaver Creek.

“She’s a very technical sound skier,” Taylor said before Mikaela’s race. “She’s very strong, powerful. I think she’s going to go for it, but I think since it’s her first speed event on the World Cup circuit, she’s going to feel it out, see how it goes. I think she’s going to be smart about it, to break the ice.”
