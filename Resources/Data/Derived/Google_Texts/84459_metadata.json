Right now federal dollars are funding the exchange, but soon Rhode Island will have to come up with $20 million to keep it running.\n\nRepublican Catherine Taylor said it would be worth it to hang on to the exchange, and find a way to cut how much it costs. \"This is the one mechanism we have identified where an individual purchaser of insurance, you and me, can put our own hands on the levers of cost and quality. And over time, move cost and quality to a better place,\" said Taylor.\n\nTaylor\u2019s democratic rival, Dan McKee says he applauds the effort to build HealthSource RI, but said the state can\u2019t afford to throw money at a health insurance exchange. \u201cWe can\u2019t absorb that in our state budget. We should be putting that towards our schools towards our infrastructure, or other areas that make a lot of sense,\" said McKee.\n\nThe federal dollars to run the state\u2019s health insurance exchange run out at the end of 2015. It will be up to the next governor to decide whether the state will keep it or kill it.\n\nDo you have insight or expertise on this topic?
