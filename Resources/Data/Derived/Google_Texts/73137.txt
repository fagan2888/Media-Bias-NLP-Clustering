Air Force Major Adrianna Vorderbruggen was the highest ranking officer killed in Monday's deadly suicide bomber attack.

"She's a hero, and, I hope she's a hero to all of us not just to me," Christopher Vorderbruggen, her brother, said.

He said his trailblazing sister was charged with protecting the largest U.S. military base in Afghanistan. Vorderbruggen was leading a security patrol near Bagram Air Base about 25 miles north of Kabul, when a Taliban suicide bomber on a motorcycle drove into their group and detonated an explosive vest.

"She intentionally would go on these patrols with her men because she wanted to show them that she would do what she was asking them to do," Christopher said.

Vorderbruggen, 36, was stationed here in northwest Florida at Eglin Air Force Base. She was also the first openly gay female Air Force officer to be killed in action and long championed the repeal of the military's "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy.

It's a change that now makes her wife, Heather, and their son eligible for military benefits.

In an emotional statement, Heather said "Adrianna was the light of our lives. Our son Jacob and I miss her so much. She has always been my hero, never more so than now."

Vorderbruggen was assigned to the Air Force Office Of Special Investigations, 9th Field Investigations Squadron. She deployed with her unit earlier this year in support of Operation Freedom's Sentinel.

She is the fourth woman to be killed in action in Afghanistan since the start of the Global War on Terror.
