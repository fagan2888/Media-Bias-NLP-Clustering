Female Broncos fans, take note: The team announced that the NFL Women’s Apparel Style Lounge is coming to Mile High Stadium on Sunday. The event, which the NFL is billing as a way to appeal to female fans, will take place from noon until kickoff at the south end of the stadium.

The pop-up lounge will feature women’s NFL apparel for sale, a DJ and “fanicures,” which I can only assume are some kind of football- or Broncos-themed manicures. Attendance is free and open to the public.

Kickoff for Broncos-Chiefs is at 6:30 p.m. Sunday.
