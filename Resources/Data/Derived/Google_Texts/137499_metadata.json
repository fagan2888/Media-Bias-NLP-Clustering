Garodnick has pushed for police reform, rallied with labor leaders in support of paid sick days and fought to preserve middle-class housing in his district.\n\nSo until recently, it would have been hard to imagine him being pilloried by former allies as he now wages an uphill fight for the City Council speakership. His opponent, Melissa Mark-Viverito, a fellow Manhattan Democrat, has the backing of powerful unions and, not least, the new mayor, Bill de Blasio. She currently claims the support of 30 of the 51 council members and is trying to hold her majority together until the Council votes on Wednesday to elect a speaker.\n\nMr. Garodnick has refused to concede, saying that he believes that the mayor\u2019s interference threatens to weaken the Council. He hopes that he can sway six council members to his side before the vote, aided by the backing he has secured from the powerful party leaders of Queens and the Bronx.\n\nAsked last week if there was any awkwardness for him in being the candidate of party bosses often vilified as vestiges of a different era, Mr. Garodnick let out a short laugh, then left a long, long pause.\n\n\u201cNot really,\u201d he said finally, \u201cbecause at this point we are trying to win an election.\u201d\n\nMr. Garodnick, 41, is no one\u2019s image of a party hack. A graduate of Dartmouth College \u2014 president of his class all four years \u2014 and a former securities lawyer at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, he is described by current and former colleagues as hard-working and unflappable.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe grew up in his district, first in Stuyvesant Town and then in Peter Cooper Village, where he now lives with his wife and two children, two buildings away from his parents.\n\nHe showed an early bent for politics: He worked on his first campaign in high school, stuffing fliers under doors in a district leader race. As a young lawyer, he took the subway on weekends to far-flung neighborhoods to explore; his dates were subjected to round-trip ferry rides to Staten Island for dinner.\n\nWhen he first ran for the Council in 2005, he knocked on the more than 11,200 doors in Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village and called every Democrat in Waterside Plaza, a 1,470-unit complex. He won a four-way primary with 56 percent of the vote.\n\nMonths after he took office, Metropolitan Life, the longtime owner of Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village \u2014 leafy brick developments that have been an oasis for middle-class families in Manhattan, and where some 20 percent of his constituents live \u2014 announced that it would auction them. Working with the tenants association, Mr. Garodnick helped raise $4.5 billion in a bid to turn them into a tenant-owned cooperative.\n\nWhen the bid failed, and the new landlords began trying to evict rent-stabilized tenants, Mr. Garodnick organized free legal clinics and helped bring a lawsuit against MetLife and the new owners that resulted in thousands of apartments coming back under rent stabilization. Since 2010, when the new owners defaulted on their mortgages, Mr. Garodnick has been at the center of new efforts to buy the properties on behalf of the tenants.\n\n\u201cDan has been an amazing leader,\u201d John Marsh, the president of the tenants association, said.\n\nIn the Council, Mr. Garodnick has often collaborated with the members of the Progressive Caucus to pass legislation, but he has also shown an independent streak, which may be hurting him now.\n\nMs. Mark-Viverito, 44, a co-chairwoman of the Progressive Caucus, endorsed Mr. de Blasio early in the mayoral primary, and some believe that he is now repaying the favor. (Mr. Garodnick did not make an endorsement in the primary.) Local 1199 of the Service Employees International Union, the health care workers\u2019 union, which gave Mr. de Blasio critical support, made it clear soon after his election that it wanted Ms. Mark-Viverito to become speaker.\n\nBoth candidates reached out to business and real estate leaders as they ramped up their campaigns, but Mr. Garodnick is better known in those worlds. Developers see him as an honest negotiator, if not a consistent ally. Ms. Mark-Viverito is viewed more warily, partly because of her close labor ties. Leading figures in real estate made their feelings known early in the campaign, but it is unclear whether they are continuing to lobby for Mr. Garodnick.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNonetheless, Ms. Mark-Viverito\u2019s supporters accuse Mr. Garodnick of becoming a stalking horse for forces trying to stall Mr. de Blasio\u2019s agenda, and they warn that by standing in the way of the person who would be the first Latina speaker \u2014 Ms. Mark-Viverito was born in Puerto Rico \u2014 he is stoking enmity.\n\nMr. Garodnick, for his part, says that if the mayor essentially chooses the speaker, the Council will be unable to serve as an effective check on the mayor\u2019s power.\n\n\u201cHolding hearings, questioning the way things are done, pushing commissioners to do better \u2014 that is a central role of the City Council,\u201d Mr. Garodnick said.\n\n\u201cWhere the mayor is involved in determining the leadership,\u201d he added, \u201cthat becomes much more difficult.\u201d\n\nWith only three days left, his supporters say that they believe he can prevail, and that it may not be clear until Wednesday how all the council members will vote.\n\nThe speaker\u2019s race, which tends to be decided in back rooms, was not Mr. Garodnick\u2019s first choice of a next step. Early in 2012, he announced a campaign for comptroller, but he withdrew when Scott M. Stringer, who was Manhattan borough president and had been campaigning for mayor, decided to run for comptroller instead.\n\n\u201cAnyone would have to have misgivings about this process,\u201d Andrew Ehrlich, a partner at Paul, Weiss and a close friend of Mr. Garodnick\u2019s, said. \u201cPure politics isn\u2019t what drives him,\u201d he added of his friend. \u201cIn fact, I think he hates it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140105204116, "twitter": {"description": "Daniel R.
