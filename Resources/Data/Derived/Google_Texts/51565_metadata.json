Without financial assistance with their premiums, millions of those consumers would drop coverage.\n\nDisruptions in the affected states wouldn\u2019t end there. If droves of healthy people bail out of HealthCare.gov, residents buying individual policies outside the government market could be next. Self-pay customers would face a jump in premiums because they\u2019re in the same insurance pool as the subsidized ones.\n\nHealth insurers spent millions to defeat the law as it was being debated. But the industry told the court last month that the subsidies are a key to making the overhaul work. Withdrawing them would \u201cmake the situation worse than it was before\u201d Congress passed the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe debate over \u201cObamacare\u201d was messy enough when just politics and ideology were involved. It gets really dicey with the well-being of millions of people in the balance.\n\n\u201cIt is not simply a function of law or ideology; there are practical impacts on high numbers of people,\u201d said Republican Mike Leavitt, a former federal health secretary now heading a health care consulting firm.\n\nThe legal issues involve the leeway federal agencies have in applying complex legislation. Opponents argue that the precise wording of the law only allows subsidies in states that set up their own insurance markets, or exchanges. That would leave out most beneficiaries, who live in states where the federal government runs the exchanges. The administration and the law\u2019s Democratic authors say Congress clearly intended to provide subsidies in every state.\n\nWhile predicting a victory, the White House has not prepared consumers for the consequences of a reversal. Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia M. Burwell repeatedly said that \u201cnothing has changed,\u201d even as other supporters of the law grew alarmed when the Supreme Court unexpectedly took the case.\n\nAt a Senate hearing Wednesday, Burwell refused to get into \u2018what-if\u2019 scenarios, telling Republican lawmakers she is completely focused on the current sign-up season.\n\nWith oral arguments set for March 4 and a decision expected early in the summer, here\u2019s what\u2019s at stake:\n\nRED STATES IN THE PATH\n\nInsurance losses would be concentrated in Republican-led states, which have resisted \u201cObamacare.\u201d\n\nFlorida, Texas, North Carolina, Georgia, Michigan, and New Jersey are among those with the most to lose. Residents of blue states that are running their own markets would continue to receive benefits.\n\nBecause the health law\u2019s 2015 sign-up season is still under way, it\u2019s unclear how many millions of people could become uninsured. Two independent studies estimate around 8 million.\n\nNot all the 37 states where the federal government is currently running insurance markets would be affected equally. Some have made progress setting up their own exchanges.\n\nTIME TO SCRAMBLE\n\nIf the Supreme Court rules in late June, that would leave about three months until the start of the next sign-up season for coverage.\n\nIf the ruling goes against the subsidies, it\u2019s unclear whether the courts can delay the effects for more than a few weeks, and most state legislatures are not in session during the summer.\n\nThere\u2019s speculation that the White House could quickly roll out an administrative fix, but Obama could also toss the whole mess into the lap of the GOP-led Congress.\n\nTechnically, a few tweaks from Congress would fix the problem. But after repeated votes to repeal \u201cObamacare,\u201d would any Republicans be willing to facilitate its rescue?\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t see fixes the administration can make, and we don\u2019t see Congress acting to fix this,\u201d said Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress, a public-policy center aligned with the White House.\n\nREPUBLICAN vs. REPUBLICAN?\n\nFaced with constituents at risk of losing coverage, some congressional Republicans may be willing to make fixes to the subsidies in exchange for concessions from Obama on a long hit list of health law provisions they object to.\n\nBut other Republicans will not want to lift a finger to bail out the program they\u2019ve railed against.\n\nDespite several proposals in the five years since the health care overhaul passed, Republicans have failed to find a consensus alternative and remain hard-pressed to do so.\n\nTo complicate matters, budget experts say a congressional fix restoring some or all of the subsidies would have to be paid for with either spending cuts or tax increases.\n\nThe last time the Supreme Court ruled on the health care law, the result was a 5-4 decision upholding its central requirement that virtually all Americans must carry health insurance. This time, it won\u2019t just be political junkies holding their breath before the announcement, but many consumers as well.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Supreme Court is taking another look at President Barack Obama's health care law, and this time it's not just the White House that should be worried.", "pubdate": 20150204, "og": {"site_name": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "The Supreme Court is taking another look at President Barack Obama's health care law, and this time it's not just the White House that should be worried.", "title": "What's at stake in Supreme Court's health care law case?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/108296908.jpg", "url": "http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/whats-stake-supreme-courts-health-care-law-case/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "The Supreme Court is taking another look at President Barack Obama's health care law, and this time it's not just the White House that should be worried.", "title": "What's at stake in Supreme Court's health care law case?", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/108296908.jpg", "creator": "@newshour", "site": "@newshour", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"app_id": 114150878604116}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newshour", "tag": "Supreme Court"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "health care, Supreme Court"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd7d0\"", "article_summary": "The last time the Supreme Court ruled on the health care law, the result was a 5-4 decision upholding its central requirement that virtually all Americans must carry health insurance.\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Supreme Court is taking another look at President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law, and this time it\u2019s not just the White House that should be worried.\nTIME TO SCRAMBLEIf the Supreme Court rules in late June, that would leave about three months until the start of the next sign-up season for coverage.\nDespite several proposals in the five years since the health care overhaul passed, Republicans have failed to find a consensus alternative and remain hard-pressed to do so.\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Sylvia M.
