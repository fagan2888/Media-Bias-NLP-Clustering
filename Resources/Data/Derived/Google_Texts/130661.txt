The trick is to reduce reported income. With the new exchanges, a premium subsidy kicks in for those with income 100 percent to 400 percent of the federal poverty level. For individuals in 2014, the ceiling for subsidies will be $45,960; for a family of four, $94,200. The subsidy is essentially a new kind of refundable tax credit. You can use it now to pay for coverage or apply it to your 2014 federal tax return, which you'll file in 2015. (Consumer Reports provides a free health tax credit tool to help you figure out how big a tax credit/subsidy you're eligible for.)

With some exceptions, those who can afford coverage but don’t buy it must pay a fine when filing 2014 taxes; for individuals, it’s 1 percent of income or $95, whichever is higher. (The fine rises yearly to a maximum of 2.5 percent of income or $695 per person, whichever is higher, in 2016; after that it’s adjusted for inflation.)

To determine subsidy eligibility, the marketplaces consider an individual’s or household’s estimated 2014 modified adjusted gross income (MAGI). In this insurance calculation, MAGI is similar to adjusted gross income (AGI), but adds tax-exempt interest back in, as well as the income and housing cost of a citizen or resident living abroad, and the nontaxable portion of Social Security income that normally isn’t part of the AGI calculation.

You can deduct a number of items from MAGI, including college tuition, student-loan interest, pretax money put into health savings accounts and individual retirement accounts, and other expenses and deductions available to self-employed people. As you’ll see here, you can also reduce your MAGI with contributions to 401(k)s and other qualified retirement accounts.

Consider a 28-year-old single man in California with a MAGI of $23,000 a year, no employer-based coverage, and low expected use of medical services. In Covered California, that state’s marketplace, the lowest-priced “silver” policy with Anthem Blue Cross—considered middle-of-the- road coverage—would cost him $1,356 a year, with a subsidy of $1,836.

Contributing $2,000 to a traditional IRA would reduce his MAGI to $21,000. At that level, he’d pay $1,056 for coverage, saving $300 a year and gaining a higher subsidy for out-of-pocket costs. Assuming income-tax rates are stable between 2014 and 2013, he’d also save $300 in federal taxes and $71 in California state taxes. You could view the total $671 in savings as reducing his premium to $685.
