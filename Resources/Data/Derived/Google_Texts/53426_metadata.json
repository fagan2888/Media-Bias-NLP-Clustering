To physicians, it is a limited solution for a much larger problem,\u201d Dr. Scott Shapiro, the society's president, wrote in a statement.\n\nHighmark said May 3 that it would increase incentives for primary care physicians who accurately complete documentation on a higher percentage of patients with the insurer's Medicare Advantage and ACA plans.\n\nShapiro said the program emerged from talks between the medical society and Highmark after the society criticized the insurer for reducing payments by 4.5 percent for doctors who treat ACA patients.\n\nThe reduction was one of several measures the insurer took to stem $773 million in losses on plans Highmark sold through the federal insurance marketplace for 2014 and 2015. The insurer also raised the plans' premiums, which had been among the lowest in the nation. The medical society said doctors should not be held responsible for Highmark's cost management.\n\nShapiro said the $5.5 million incentive program will add more work for busy physician practices and excludes specialists whose reimbursement has been reduced. He said the money for the program comes from the federal government.\n\n\u201cA company that maintains $6.5 billion in cash and investments and $5.4 billion in surplus should be better positioned to keep their contractual obligations to physicians, and not continue the bad precedent of cutting physicians to restore corporate profit,\u201d he said.\n\nHighmark spokesman Aaron Billger declined to discuss specifics of the disagreement.\n\n\u201cWe stand by our commitment to independent physicians and our new program, which will help support primary care providers in their critical work of taking care of patients,\u201d he wrote in a statement.\n\nWes Venteicher is a Tribune-Review staff writer.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Wes Venteicher", "description": "The president of the Pennsylvania Medical Society said Thursday that a reimbursement program from Highmark Inc. worth as much as $5.5 million doesn't make up ...", "pubdate": "2016-05-12 14:12:00", "author": "Wes Venteicher", "og": {"site_name": "TribLIVE.com", "description": "The president of the Pennsylvania Medical Society said Thursday that a reimbursement program from Highmark Inc. worth as much as $5.5 million doesn't make up ...", "title": "Doctors' group attacks Highmark incentive plan", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://triblive.com/csp/mediapool/sites/dt.common.streams.StreamServer.cls?STREAMOID=jLAUkf8NU88klvRZ_$c9gs$daE2N3K4ZzOUsqbU5sYv2DAFtFR3vlBw7Eujm4hbrWCsjLu883Ygn4B49Lvm9bPe2QeMKQdVeZmXF$9l$4uCZ8QDXhaHEp3rvzXRJFdy0KqPHLoMevcTLo3h8xh70Y6N_U_CryOsw6FTOdKL_jpQ-&CONTENTTYPE=image/jpeg", "updated_time": "2016-05-12 23:01:49.811", "url": "http://triblive.com/news/adminpage/10459087-74/highmark-physicians-care", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"description": "The president of the Pennsylvania Medical Society said Thursday that a reimbursement program from Highmark Inc. worth as much as $5.5 million doesn't make up ...", "creator": "@triblive", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "tribbird://", "iphone": "tribbird://"}, "name": {"ipad": "TribLIVE News and Sports", "iphone": "TribLIVE News and Sports"}, "id": {"ipad": 328217517, "iphone": 328217517}}, "title": "Doctors' group attacks Highmark incentive plan", "site": {"identifier": "@triblive", "id": 20269833}, "image": "http://triblive.com/csp/mediapool/sites/dt.common.streams.StreamServer.cls?STREAMOID=jLAUkf8NU88klvRZ_$c9gs$daE2N3K4ZzOUsqbU5sYv2DAFtFR3vlBw7Eujm4hbrWCsjLu883Ygn4B49Lvm9bPe2QeMKQdVeZmXF$9l$4uCZ8QDXhaHEp3rvzXRJFdy0KqPHLoMevcTLo3h8xh70Y6N_U_CryOsw6FTOdKL_jpQ-&CONTENTTYPE=image/jpeg", "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2016-05-12 14:12:00", "fb": {"app_id": 144410955752326}, "sailthru.title": "Doctors' group attacks Highmark incentive plan", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=328217517", "sailthru.canonical": "http://triblive.com/news/adminpage/10459087-74/highmark-physicians-care", "keywords": "highmark, program, society, physicians, care", "headline": "Doctors' group attacks Highmark incentive plan", "sailthru.tags": "Newsletter, News, Breaking", "article": {"category": "News", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/triblive", "published_time": "2016-05-12 14:12:00", "subcategory": "Admin Page", "mainsection": "News", "section": "News", "publishedtoweb": "2016-05-12 14:12:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-12 23:01:49.811", "tag": "highmark, program, society, physicians, care", "subsection": "Admin Page", "title": "Doctors' group attacks Highmark incentive plan", "author": "Wes Venteicher"}, "docauthor": "Wes Venteicher", "sailthru.description": "The president of the Pennsylvania Medical Society said Thursday that a reimbursement program from Highmark Inc. worth as much as $5.5 million doesn't make up ..."}, "article_summary": "Doctors' group attacks Highmark incentive planThe president of the Pennsylvania Medical Society said Thursday that a reimbursement program from Highmark Inc. worth as much as $5.5 million doesn't make up for cutting payments to doctors who treat patients with federal Affordable Care Act health insurance plans.\nThe medical society said doctors should not be held responsible for Highmark's cost management.\nShapiro said the program emerged from talks between the medical society and Highmark after the society criticized the insurer for reducing payments by 4.5 percent for doctors who treat ACA patients.\nShapiro said the $5.5 million incentive program will add more work for busy physician practices and excludes specialists whose reimbursement has been reduced.\nHighmark said May 3 that it would increase incentives for primary care physicians who accurately complete documentation on a higher percentage of patients with the insurer's Medicare Advantage and ACA plans."}
