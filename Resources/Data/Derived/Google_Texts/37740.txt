A millionaire real estate developer from Tuscaloosa is the man behind the Donald Trump-bashing skywriting messages that appeared over the Rose Parade on New Year’s Day.

Stan Pate confirmed that he is behind the messages, which read “America is great, Trump is disgusting, anybody but Trump.”

The skywriting appeared in the air over the Rose Parade in Pasadena, CA.

Pate said he wants to lead an effort to unite people behind candidates other than Trump. He said Trump talks “hate, hate, hate,” and that Trump has seen the “first of a campaign that will get his attention.”

"Hate is not a policy. These other people that are running for president have the country’s best interest in mind. Trump only has his interest in mind," Pate said.

Six planes were used to write the message, which would could be seen from a 10-mile radius.
