During a trade mission to London this month, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker declined to discuss several topics during an appearance at the Chatham House think tank, including ISIS, Ukraine and his general foreign policy vision. \u201cI\u2019m going to punt on that one as well,\u201d Walker said in response to a question on whether he believes in evolution.\n\nRelated: No Diploma? No Problem, Says Gov. Scott Walker\n\nAround the same time, Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) tried to dodge a reporter\u2019s question about whether he would support Obama\u2019s proposed Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) in battling ISIS. The question came after Paul had criticized the president for not sending up specific language.\n\nPaul for months had urged Congress to do its job by debating a resolution to give the president the authority he needs to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIS forces, if that is possible. But once Obama had submitted his request on Feb. 11, Paul was hard to pin down on whether he would support it.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have time right now, thanks,\u201d Paul said when he was tracked down by a National Journal reporter on Capitol Hill.\n\nOthers including Sens. Marco Rubio (R-FL) and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie have also been heavy on the criticism of Obama\u2019s strategies but light on their own foreign policy and military prescriptions.\n\nRelated: Jeb Bush on His Brother: \u2018Mistakes Were Made\u2019\n\n\u201cMost candidates haven\u2019t put much out,\u201d Gordon Adams, a military historian and instructor at American University, said. \u201cThe Jeb Bush speech in Chicago was pretty thin on content.\u201d\n\nAdams added, \u201cIt\u2019s mostly 30,000-feet rhetoric that is chest thumping. That is, they\u2019re saying, \u2018We have to regain America\u2019s respect around the world.\u2019 And I have to say I\u2019m almost tired of it, because it\u2019s like we have been doing this back and forth for several presidential elections. The party that\u2019s out says the party that\u2019s in has destroyed America\u2019s reputation abroad.\u201d\n\nThe country should get another dose of the Republicans\u2019 military and defense stands this week when the annual Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) kicks off on Wednesday.\n\nAs of right now, here\u2019s where the presumed candidates stand on the threat of ISIS and what the administration should do about it.\n\nJeb Bush\n\nHe offers little that distinguishes him from most of the other Republicans who appear interested in the GOP nomination \u2013 or from Obama, for that matter. He talks about the need to \u201ctake out\u201d ISIS in concert with Middle Eastern allies operating \u201cin the neighborhood.\u201d This sounds strangely similar to Obama\u2019s current plan of leading allied airstrikes while training and arming Iraqi military and friendly militias in Iraq and neighboring Syria.\n\n\u201cI believe fundamentally that weakness invites war \u2026 and strength encourages peace,\u201d said Bush. It\u2019s hard to argue with that.\n\nScott Walker\n\nThe governor who surged in the polls after delivering a fiery speech a month ago to conservative believers in Iowa has generally stayed mum about his foreign policy and national security positions. He said last year that foreign policy isn\u2019t \u201can area that governors typically look at.\u201d\n\nWhile he refused to discuss ISIS and other foreign policy matters in London recently, he began to loosen after returning home. Last Thursday, he said on CNBC that the U.S. may need to deploy ground troops in the fight against ISIS.\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s special ops or other engagements out there, we\u2019ve got to be prepared to do what it takes to keep America safe,\u201d Walker said on the \u201cSquawk Box\u201d program. \u201cI think we need aggressive leadership to take the fight to them instead of waiting for it to come to us.\u201d\n\nRelated: How Far Will GOP Presidential Hopefuls Go to Destroy ISIS?\n\nRand Paul\n\nThe Kentucky Republican early on took a bold, non-interventionist stand on foreign policy \u2013 only to readjust his positions in the face of mounting concerns from Senate Armed Services Committee Chair John McCain of Arizona and other GOP defense hawks about the threat of ISIS in Iraq and Syria. The son of former Rep. Ron Paul (R-TX), a libertarian leader, Rand Paul is proving to be far less of an anti-war candidate than his father.\n\nAfter signaling a wariness to get too deeply involved in Iraq, Paul introduced his own war powers measure last December that would grant the president authority to wage war against ISIS. It would include deploying ground troops in special cases, like rescue operations. However, unlike Obama who is seeking a three-year authorization, Paul favors a one-year time limit.\n\nMarco Rubio\n\nThe Florida Republican has traveled abroad widely since joining the Senate to burnish his foreign policy credentials. Earlier, he had alienated many conservatives by sponsoring immigration reform legislation that provided a path to citizenship.\n\nAs a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, Rubio has taken an aggressive stand on dealing with ISIS and \u2013 more generally \u2013 on how Obama should have responded to other Middle East hotspots.\n\nRelated: Christie\u2019s Presidential Prospects on a Steady Slide\n\nHe told Politico recently he\u2019d been right when he warned the U.S. to immediately arm moderate Syrian rebels two years ago \u2014 before ISIS radicals began beheading hostages and declaring a caliphate. Rubio has advocated a broad authorization for use of force against ISIS, and he\u2019s not ruling out sending in U.S. ground troops. He has said airstrikes alone won\u2019t work and that ISIS can only be defeated by confrontation on the ground.\n\nRubio also agrees with the administration that there should be no geographic limitations to pursuing ISIS beyond Iraq and Syria.\n\nChris Christie\n\nThe New Jersey governor generally speaks in broad terms about the raging conflict in the Middle East and the mounting threat of terrorism. He has sharply criticized Obama\u2019s handling of the crisis, insisting the administration underestimated the threat and was too slow in responding.\n\nChristie has also called for a strong military response, saying on a trip to Iowa this month that stronger leadership doesn\u2019t necessarily mean \u201cboots on the ground in every conflict,\u201d according to CNN.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush was largely underwhelming last week in delivering\u00a0his", "title": "GOP 2016 Hopefuls Throw Darts at Obama, Bombs at ISIS", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/24/GOP-2016-Hopefuls-Throw-Darts-Obama-Bombs-ISIS", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/01152013_republicans_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/24/GOP-2016-Hopefuls-Throw-Darts-Obama-Bombs-ISIS", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/01152013_republicans_article.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush was largely underwhelming last week in delivering\u00a0his", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2392\"", "article_summary": "Marco RubioThe Florida Republican has traveled abroad widely since joining the Senate to burnish his foreign policy credentials.\nScott Walker declined to discuss several topics during an appearance at the Chatham House think tank, including ISIS, Ukraine and his general foreign policy vision.\nHe said last year that foreign policy isn\u2019t \u201can area that governors typically look at.\u201dWhile he refused to discuss ISIS and other foreign policy matters in London recently, he began to loosen after returning home.\nChris Christie have also been heavy on the criticism of Obama\u2019s strategies but light on their own foreign policy and military prescriptions.\nAs of right now, here\u2019s where the presumed candidates stand on the threat of ISIS and what the administration should do about it."}
