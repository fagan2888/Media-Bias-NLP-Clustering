(The ice bucket challenge is) something that\u2019s fun that people can do \u2026 people are taking part in it and then taking the info and donating.\u201d\n\nThe viral nature of the effort surprised even The ALS Association.\n\n\u201cThis level of unprecedented giving is (something) I don\u2019t think this country has seen before outside of a disaster or emergency,\u201d said ALS Association spokesperson Carrie Munk. \u201cWe had no idea it would get to this point.\u201d\n\nWho should get credit for making this a viral sensation depends on whom you ask. Some say it began earlier this month when friends of a 29-year-old Boston man with ALS, a neurodegenerative disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord, did a group challenge.\n\nIt\u2019s also demonstrated that the average Joe or Jane can make waves.\n\n\u201cOne of the big take-aways is the power of individuals who are so tightly connected to a cause can really make a difference,\u201d Munk said. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure that if any company or any nonprofit had all of the public relations dollars in the world to come up with a campaign, we never would\u2019ve seen this kind of success.\u201d\n\nLucretia Gilbert, executive director of The Pink Agenda, which raises money for breast cancer research and awareness, believes it will encourage other nonprofits to get creative on social media.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very simple thing and that\u2019s kind of the beauty of it. Everyone can do this challenge,\u201d she said.\n\nThe effort comes at a time when private groups are searching for new ways to raise dollars in the wake of tighter federal government spending on basic medical research, including on diseases like ALS.\n\nThe National Institutes of Health is spending about $30 billion this year, money that is divided in a highly competitive process to scientists around the country, and the world, to pursue what are deemed the most promising leads to understand various diseases and find new targets to fight them.\n\nCongress cut government spending last year; in 2012, the NIH\u2019s budget was $30.8 billion. And even before those cuts, the agency\u2019s budget hadn\u2019t kept pace with inflation for about a decade. As a result, the NIH is funding about 1 in 6 grant applications \u2014 down from about 1 in 3 a decade ago, Director Francis Collins said earlier this year.\n\nFor Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease, the NIH\u2019s estimated budget this year is $40 million, down from $44 million in 2012.\n\nEmploying technology for fundraising campaigns, of course, isn\u2019t a new idea: Perhaps one of the most enduring began in 1966 when the Muscular Dystrophy Association had its first annual Labor Day weekend telethon. Last year, it raised $59.6 million in contributions. Fundraisers have also embraced donating by text message in recent years.\n\nBut some fundraisers contend that one of their greatest challenges is asking the same people for money year after year \u2014 a challenge successful social media campaigns could solve.\n\nMindy Bailey, corporate and community development specialist for JDRF, a foundation that raises money to fight Type 1 diabetes, said volunteers want to come up with a similar idea to fuel donations.\n\n\u201cWe have had a lot of people reach out to us and say, \u2018Hey, we\u2019re going to do the ice bucket challenge,'\u201d Bailey said. \u201cRecently we had a woman say, \u2018I\u2019m thinking of doing a pie-in-your-face idea.\u2019 The wheels have been turning.\u201d\n\nHowever, not everyone is a fan of the public approach of the ice bucket challenge.\n\n#NoIceBucketChallenge is a hashtag on Twitter that\u2019s being used for a variety of reasons.\n\n\u201cI just think it seems hokey and far too gimmicky and a hot trend and part of the whole \u2018me\u2019 culture of \u2018Oh look at me. Pay attention to me,'\u201d said Cameron Mitchell of New York. \u201cThe charity part seems like an afterthought.\u201d\n\nSome even argue that it\u2019s wasteful to dump water, even for a cause, especially in places like California, where there\u2019s a drought.\n\nThe California Water Board offered a measured response.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t violate any of our regulations. People should always use good judgment whenever they use water while we\u2019re in a drought. On the other hand, we understand that this is a charitable event,\u201d said George N. Kostyroko, director of the California State Water Resources Control Board\u2019s office of public affairs, in an email.\n\nAnnoyed, impressed or otherwise, the ice bucket challenge has people talking \u2014 and ALS\u2019s Munk asserts that even if they don\u2019t donate, the campaign has raised public awareness, a major focus of the organization that last year spent 32 percent of its annual budget on public and professional education and 27 percent on research.\n\nJust a few years ago, she said, only about 50 percent of Americans knew what ALS is.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really looking forward to see how the needle moves,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The ice bucket challenge's phenomenal success is making other charitable organizations rethink how they connect with a younger generation of potential donors.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "AP", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "The ice bucket challenge's phenomenal success is making other charitable organizations rethink how they connect with a younger generation of potential donors.", "title": "Ice Bucket Challenge May Change Nonprofit World", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/ice-bucket-challenge-may-change-nonprofit-world/195736/", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Ice-Bucket-Phenom_Muha.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-08-22T12:24:54-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The ice bucket challenge's phenomenal success is making other charitable organizations rethink how they connect with a younger generation of potential donors.", "title": "Ice Bucket Challenge May Change Nonprofit World", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Ice-Bucket-Phenom_Muha.jpg", "creator": "@MintPressNews", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Daily Digest", "tag": "nonprofits", "published_time": "2014-08-23T05:00:52-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-22T12:24:54-05:00"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcda7f\"", "article_summary": "Ice Bucket Challenge May Change Nonprofit WorldThe ice bucket challenge's phenomenal success is making other charitable organizations rethink how they connect with a younger generation of potential donors.\n\u201cWe have had a lot of people reach out to us and say, \u2018Hey, we\u2019re going to do the ice bucket challenge,'\u201d Bailey said.\nNEW YORK \u2014 The ice bucket challenge\u2019s phenomenal success is making other charitable organizations rethink how they connect with a younger generation of potential donors.\n(The ice bucket challenge is) something that\u2019s fun that people can do \u2026 people are taking part in it and then taking the info and donating.\u201dThe viral nature of the effort surprised even The ALS Association.\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsorThe ice bucket challenge has shown it\u2019s OK to be silly for a good cause, says Brian Mittendorf, a professor at the Ohio State University Fisher College of Business, who teaches courses in nonprofit finance."}
