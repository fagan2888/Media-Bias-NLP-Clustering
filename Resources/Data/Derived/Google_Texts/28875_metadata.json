Burgess, director of the Florida Program for Shark Research.\n\n\u201cThe fact you had a couple bites in close succession always worries scientists and suggests there might be a single individual involved,\u201d Mr. Burgess said, noting that he\u2019s only seen two other circumstances in which he believed a single shark was involved in multiple attacks on the same day.\n\nPHOTOS: What are the chances?\n\nWith most beaches in North Carolina lacking lifeguards, and without authorities keeping watch, Mr. Burgess recommended temporarily closing the beach.\n\nOak Island\u2019s beaches were open Monday, and officials said they can\u2019t stop people from swimming. However crowds staking out a sliver of sand were noticeably thinner Monday than the previous day.\n\n\u201cI would describe the beach as empty as compared to when we were here yesterday,\u201d said Lori Little, of Claremont, North Carolina, who was vacationing with her husband. \u201cI don\u2019t think people are quite ready to get in the water yet.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, chaos erupted as the attacks disrupted one of the first busy weekends since public schools ended for summer. The victims \u2014 a girl from Asheboro and a boy from Colorado Springs, Colorado \u2014 were bleeding heavily, and other beachgoers applied makeshift tourniquets.\n\nIt was \u201cquite nightmarish,\u201d vacationer Steve Bouser said. \u201cI saw someone carry this girl (out of the water), and people were swarming around and trying to help \u2026 It was quite terrible.\u201d\n\nSurgeons amputated the girl\u2019s left arm below her elbow, and she has tissue damage to her lower left leg. The boy\u2019s left arm was amputated below his left shoulder. Both were in good condition Monday at the New Hanover Regional Medical Center in Wilmington. Neither name was released.\n\nBoth were in waist-deep water about 20 yards offshore of an Oak Island beach.\n\nNorth Carolina ranks fourth in the United States in the number of attacks reported. Mr. Burgess counts 52 shark attacks on humans in North Carolina waters from 1935 to 2014. There were 72 shark attacks on humans around the world in 2014.\n\nTim Holloman, Oak Island\u2019s town administrator, said as a precaution a city-run surf camp scheduled for this week had been cancelled and that officials have discussed instituting a short-term ban on fishing for sharks from either the pier or beaches. But aside from that, he doesn\u2019t expect any kind of economic downturn to befall the town on account of the attacks.\n\n\u201cI was down at the beach today and I didn\u2019t see a lot of people in the water, so I think some people were being cautious,\u201d Mr. Holloman said. \u201cI think it will get back to normal, short of having another event.\u201d\n\nThose who do return to the water should avoid swimming where people are fishing, stay out of the water if they have bleeding cuts, and avoid swimming in turbulent water or after a storm, Mr. Holloman said.\n\nBeing mindful of sharks and dangerous conditions are among the first lessons surfing instructor Rick Civelli went over Monday as he escorted a group of children into the water at Wrightsville Beach, located about 40 miles north of Oak Island.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t skirt the issue, that was the first thing we talked about,\u201d the WB Surf Camp owner said.\n\nWhile his shop fielded numerous calls from people concerned about getting back into the ocean after the shark attacks, Mr. Civelli said that out of three groups of 14 children he only had one cancellation.\n\n\u201cI think in a week it\u2019s not going to be that big of a deal,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen it\u2019s 90-something degrees in the South, you\u2019re going to the beach.\u201d\n\nThis story is based in part on wire service reports.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Back-to-back shark attacks in a North Carolina beach town tempered tourists' enthusiasm for the water Monday, but local officials kept the beaches open despite concern from one of the nation's leading shark attack experts.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Back-to-back shark attacks in a North Carolina beach town tempered tourists\u2019 enthusiasm for the water Monday, but local officials kept the beaches open despite concern from one of the nation\u2019s leading shark attack experts.", "title": "Shark attacks in North Carolina have tourists cautious of ocean", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jun/15/shark-attacks-in-north-carolina-have-tourists-caut/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/15/6_152015_ap141535116188201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/15/6_152015_ap141535116188201.jpg", "description": "Back-to-back shark attacks in a North Carolina beach town tempered tourists' enthusiasm for the water Monday, but local officials kept the beaches open despite concern from one of the nation's leading", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Shark attacks in North Carolina have tourists cautious of ocean"}, "Author": "Andrea Noble", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "George H Burgess"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb639\"", "article_summary": "Mr. Burgess counts 52 shark attacks on humans in North Carolina waters from 1935 to 2014.\nWith most beaches in North Carolina lacking lifeguards, and without authorities keeping watch, Mr. Burgess recommended temporarily closing the beach.\nBack-to-back shark attacks in a North Carolina beach town tempered tourists\u2019 enthusiasm for the water Monday, but local officials kept the beaches open despite concern from one of the nation\u2019s leading shark attack experts.\nWhile his shop fielded numerous calls from people concerned about getting back into the ocean after the shark attacks, Mr. Civelli said that out of three groups of 14 children he only had one cancellation.\nNorth Carolina ranks fourth in the United States in the number of attacks reported."}
