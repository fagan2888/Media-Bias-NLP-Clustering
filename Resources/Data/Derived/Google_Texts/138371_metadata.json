Last week, for example, he drew a sizable crowd at a Barnes & Noble in New York. As New York Times business columnist Gretchen Morgenson described it, \u201cMr. Geithner left little to chance at the event: It consisted of a highly scripted chat with a friendly interviewer who screened audience questions. After an hour, Mr. Geithner was whisked from the building.\u201d\n\nThings could not have been more different when the former Treasury Secretary appeared on Comedy Central\u2019s The Daily Show on Wednesday night. This was no cozy \u201cchat with a friendly interviewer.\u201d Host Jon Stewart spent more than 40 minutes grilling and arguing with Geithner about bank bailouts, the housing crisis, and whether the Washington establishment is too beholden to big banks.\n\nRelated: Geithner \u2013 Saving Big Banks Was the \u2018Moral Thing to Do\u2019\n\nStewart started with an absurdist take on his guest\u2019s favorite metaphor about the role of the federal government in the financial crisis. Geithner frequently compares the situation to flying a plane that has been set on fire, with the arsonists and innocent passengers still aboard. The first goal, he says, is to land the plane safely for the sake of the innocent passengers, not to punish the arsonists.\n\n\u201cYou have to do the opposite of what seems intuitive and fair,\u201d Geithner said.\n\nHowever, Stewart complained, \u201cIt felt like you got the arsonists off the plane and got them a massage and a steak dinner.\u201d\n\nRelated: Geithner\u2019s Insult a \u2018Badge of Honor\u2019 Says TARP Top Cop\n\nThe conversation did not become any more collegial as it progressed. Stewart asked many probing questions but sadly, on multiple occasions when Geithner seemed ready to deliver a detailed answer, the host cut his guest off mid-sentence.\n\nOne of the most contentious exchanges occurred after Stewart challenged Geithner for giving huge amounts of money to the financial services industry, but not doing enough to help homeowners facing foreclosure.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re assuming a unicorn,\u201d Geithner said, meaning that Stewart was suggesting that there had been a better path for the government to have taken. He said that the White House was forced to operate within the constraints set by a Congress that was more interested in budget cutting than aid programs.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re assuming we could have got Congress to go legislate hundreds of billions of dollars instead of doing all these other things, and give those directly to the homeowner and that would have been more effective,\u201d Geithner said.\n\nRelated: Geithner Book Settles Scores, Defends Policies\n\n\u201cThe only reason why I say that is because somehow a unicorn did appear for the banks,\u201d Stewart replied.\n\nGeithner has been consistent in his public statements that the bailout was, as he sees it, a choice between greater and lesser evils, not between a good alternative and a bad one. He justifies the choices made in Washington by pointing out that the economy, while terrible for years, did not plunge into a second Great Depression.\n\n\u201cBecause we did this set of, frankly pretty offensive, seemingly unfair things we have an economy that is\u2026much, much better than it would have been.\u201d\n\nStewart continued to assert, without evidence, that the administration could have provided more aid to homeowners, and less to the banks, which Geithner continually denied.\n\n\u201cI am completely confident that the alternative strategy that would have been more comfortable to you at the beginning, you would have cheered us for, you would have loved us for, would have been devastating to the people you\u2019re most worried about,\u201d Geithner said.\n\nYou can watch part of Geithner\u2019s appearance above, or see the full 42-minute interview here.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Most of Tim Geithner\u2019s appearances to promote his new book have been pretty tame affairs.
