UPDATE: June 20, 9:00 p.m.

According to Bay County Sheriff's Deputies, this morning 911 dispatchers received a call from a mother in the north end of the county who said she could not find her two-year-old son.

Deputies said they sent officers to the scene. Just before arriving, however, a deputy learned that the child had been found in the pool.

Family, friends and the deputy performed CPR until paramedics arrived. They then pronounced the child dead at the scene.

According to investigators with the sheriff's office, the father changed the boy's diaper and put him back to bed at around 6 o'clock this morning before leaving for work. When the mother woke up, she couldn't find her son and immediately woke other family members up to look for him.

Deputies said the family searched the house and checked the pool, but did not find the boy. Neighbors also searched the street and surrounding woods.

Someone called the child's father. When he came home and started looking for the boy, deputies said he found the boy in the pool behind the ladder.

Sheriff's deputies have not yet released the name of the boy or the family.
