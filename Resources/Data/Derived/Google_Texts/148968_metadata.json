He gave a rip-roaring speech at a conservative confab in Iowa last month, and it\u2019s been his moment ever since.\n\nUnless the moment ended this week when Walker went to London on an alleged trade mission and refused to say whether he believes in evolution. Or pretty much anything.\n\n\u201cFor me, commenting on foreign policy or, in this case, economic policy in a country where you\u2019re a visitor is not the politest of things,\u201d he told a BBC journalist.\n\nWho knows how that will fly with the Republican base? Maybe they\u2019re dying for a president who\u2019ll go on an international trip and confine his remarks to the virtues of Wisconsin cheese.\n\nBut about that Iowa speech: It was really a rouser. Basically, Walker talked about the \u201ccomprehensive conservative common-sense conservative agenda\u201d he\u2019s imposed on Wisconsin. His common-sense examples included making it easier for people to carry lethal weapons around the state and defunding the main organization that helps low-income Wisconsin women with family planning.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMainly, though, The Speech was about waging war on public employee unions, particularly the ones for teachers. \u201cIn 2010, there was a young woman named Megan Sampson who was honored as the outstanding teacher of the year in my state. And not long after she got that distinction, she was laid off by her school district,\u201d said Walker, lacing into teacher contracts that require layoffs be done by seniority.\n\nAll of that came as a distinct surprise to Claudia Felske, a member of the faculty at East Troy High School who actually was named a Wisconsin Teacher of the Year in 2010. In a phone interview, Felske said she still remembers when she got the news at a \u201csurprise pep assembly at my school.\u201d\n\nActually, Wisconsin names four teachers of the year, none of which has ever been Megan Sampson, who won an award for first-year English teachers given by a nonprofit group. But do not blame any of this on Sampson, poor woman, who was happily working at a new school in 2011 when Walker made her the star victim in an anti-union opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal. At the time, she expressed a strong desire not to be used as a \u201cposter child for this political agenda,\u201d and you would think that after that the governor would leave her alone. Or at least stop saying she was teacher of the year.\n\nWhen it comes to education, Walker seems prone toward this sort of intellectual hiccup. Just recently, he released a proposed budget that would have changed the University of Wisconsin\u2019s mission statement by eliminating the bits about \u201cthe search for truth,\u201d educating people and serving society, in favor of the educational goal of meeting \u201cthe state\u2019s work force needs.\u201d When all hell broke loose, Walker blamed that one on a drafting error.\n\n\u201cIs this a pattern?\u201d teacher-of-the-year Felske wondered.\n\nThat budget also contains another interesting education idea that Walker has yet to blame on inept typists. He wants to change the way teachers are licensed. Basically, the plan would be to let people with \u201creal-life experience\u201d just take a test to demonstrate that they knew their subject matter. It appears to require no training whatsoever in the actual art of teaching.\n\n\u201cTeaching is more than just knowing stuff,\u201d protested Tony Evers, the state superintendent of public instruction. \u201cIt is an extraordinarily complex skill.\u201d You may not be surprised to hear that in Wisconsin, the superintendent of education is not appointed by the governor. Evers was elected on his own, and his office is extremely unhappy about Walker\u2019s new plan.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know the origins of this idea. It wasn\u2019t discussed,\u201d said John Johnson, a spokesman for the superintendent. \u201cWe\u2019re requiring more rigor of our students, but this certainly seems like a decrease in the rigor we require of our teachers.\u201d\n\nThe idea could very well become law, whether the educators like it or not, since the Wisconsin Legislature often makes policy changes as part of the budget. We will have to let Wisconsinites worry about that.\n\nBut it gives us a fresh look at the wave of attacks on teachers\u2019 unions around the country. We definitely do not want to protect incompetent or lazy teachers. On the other hand, if you believe that teaching is a skill that it takes years of practice to master, you also do not want to encourage politicians to save money by canning the most expensive and most experienced teachers.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNot a problem for Scott Walker. His view of teaching is apparently that anybody can do it. Just the way anybody can be president.
