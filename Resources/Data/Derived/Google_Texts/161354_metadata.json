They abandoned the vehicle a short distance from the Santa Ana crosswalk where the girls were hit. Orange County fire Capt. Steve Concialdi said that two of the girls were killed immediately, and that a third girl died as paramedics prepared to take her to a hospital.\n\nThe Daily News reported that the twin sisters were Lexi and Lexandra Perez, and the third victim was Andrea Gonzalez.\n\nMaria Ramirez, 14, who lives in the neighborhood where the incident took place, said that she attended middle school with the twins and just saw them on Friday. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it happened,\u201d Ramirez said as she stood with others who were watching the aftermath of police activity. \u201cThey were fun, good girls.\u201d\n\nThe Daily Mail reported that Briana Magana, 13, said she attended Santiago Charter Middle School with one of the victims.\n\nShe recounted that she had attended a dance with one of the girls earlier in the day and had later gone for lunch at McDonald\u2019s.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable how something like this could happen,\u201d Briana said. \u201cShe always had a smile, she would light up the room, and she was just a really good student.\u201d\n\nSanta Ana Department Cpl. Anthony Bertagna, who spoke with Breitbart News on Saturday, said that the suspects driving the Honda CR-V were two black males. Bertagna also told a local TV station that they had \u201cleft these three young women laying in the street, and left without calling, without stopping, without rendering aid. It\u2019s hard to even fathom doing that.\u201d\n\nBertagna added that \u201cAt this point, we need the community\u2019s help, anybody that saw these individuals. Did they call somebody? Did they get picked up? Were they seen running on foot past the freeway?\u201d\n\nBreitbart News will continue to follow this developing story.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Police on Manhunt for Halloween Hit-and Run Suspects, Victims Identified", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Police on Manhunt for Halloween Hit-and Run Suspects, Victims Identified", "title": "Police on Manhunt for Halloween Hit-and Run Suspects, Victims Identified - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Breitbart-California/2014/11/02/Santa%20ana%20Three%20teens%20killed_S.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/california/2014/11/02/police-on-manhunt-for-halloween-hit-and-run-suspects-victims-identified/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Police on Manhunt for Halloween Hit-and Run Suspects, Victims Identified", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Breitbart-California/2014/11/02/Santa%20ana%20Three%20teens%20killed_S.jpg", "title": "Police on Manhunt for Halloween Hit-and Run Suspects, Victims Identified - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Crime, Daily Mail, Honda,Breitbart California,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Breitbart California", "tag": "Honda", "published_time": "2014-11-02T07:46:10-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart California"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "\u201cThey were fun, good girls.\u201dThe Daily Mail reported that Briana Magana, 13, said she attended Santiago Charter Middle School with one of the victims.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERPolice are still searching for two black male suspects who drove a black Honda CR-V and ran over the girls.\nMaria Ramirez, 14, who lives in the neighborhood where the incident took place, said that she attended middle school with the twins and just saw them on Friday.\nAnthony Bertagna, who spoke with Breitbart News on Saturday, said that the suspects driving the Honda CR-V were two black males.\nThey abandoned the vehicle a short distance from the Santa Ana crosswalk where the girls were hit."}
