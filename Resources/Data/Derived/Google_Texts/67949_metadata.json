The trials' secondary endpoints also pointed toward AVP-923's efficacy, including the total NPI score, clinical global impression of change-agitation, patient global impression of change, and various measures of caregiver burden. Avanir notes that the drug was generally well-tolerated with only a small percentage of patients dropping out of the trial due to adverse events.\n\nNow what: At first it might be a bit perplexing to understand why Avanir shares shot up so quickly considering that this drug is aimed at treating just a symptom of Alzheimer's disease and not the disease itself. However, at the moment there are no drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat agitation associated with Alzheimer's disease, which can be one of the disease's more unpleasant side effects for the patient, family, and/or caregiver.\n\nFurthermore, Alzheimer's disease is among the toughest-to-treat diseases, meaning an approved therapy to abate symptoms of the disease could have a very long shelf life for the innovating company. As for me, I'm not thrilled at the idea of chasing Avanir higher following today's move given its ongoing losses, but I'd certainly suggest adding the company to your watchlist for future reference in case it suffers a sizable retracement.", "article_metadata": {"publish_time": "13:15", "promo": "Avanir Pharmaceuticals' stock is today's top gainer after it reports positive midstage data on one of its lead pipeline products.
