Female CNN staffers are upset after the network permanently replaced “New Day” co-anchor Kate Bolduan while she was on maternity leave, a CNN insider told the New York Post.

Ms. Bolduan has been on maternity leave since September, with Alisyn Camerota filling in for her alongside Chris Cuomo and Michaela Pereira. But while the rest of the world fixated on the terror crisis in France, CNN announced that Ms. Bolduan would be replaced by Ms. Camerota permanently, the Post reported.

“The manner in which [CNN chief] Jeff [Zucker] did it is angering female staffers,” the unnamed insider told the Post. “They took [Ms. Bolduan] out while she was on maternity leave and buried it on a day when there’s serious news.”

The Wrap has reported “New Day” was experiencing a ratings boost with Ms. Camerota, and that Ms. Bolduan lacked chemistry with her co-anchors.

Still, it was expected that CNN would wait until Ms. Bolduan returned from maternity leave before making any changes, the Daily Mail reported.

Ms. Camerota starts on Jan. 19, while Ms. Bolduan joins “This Hour” on Jan. 26.
