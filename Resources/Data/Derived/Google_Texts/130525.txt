The Destin Airport has a new system to enhance its Aircraft Noise Complaint Management Program.

People in surrounding neighborhoods often complain about noise coming from the airport.

And the new Plane Noise System will provide the Destin Airport management team with data to address noise impact in the community.

Destin Airport officials have signed a two-year agreement with the web-based company.

Airport officials paid a nominal fee to set up the program, and will continue to pay a maintenance fee while the program is in place.

They hope residents in the area who are affected by the noise at the airport will participate.

"What we get is daily emails that tell us if a complaint has been filed, as well as a map that shows us precisely the location where the complaint was filed, plus the aircraft type," Destin Airport Deputy Director Mike Stenson said.

To file a complaint, visit the website at flyDTS.com, and click the "Noise Management" tab.
