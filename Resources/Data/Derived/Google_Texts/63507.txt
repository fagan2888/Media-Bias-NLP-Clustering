MONTGOMERY, Alabama --- Most state employees won't see much change in their health insurance plans for next year, a board determined today.

The State Employees Insurance Board voted to cover most of a projected $17 million shortfall for next year by taking money from a Retiree Trust Fund and a contingency reserve, according to a news release from the SEIB.

The projected deficit is caused by decreased funding, costs associated with the Affordable Care Act and rising healthcare costs, the SEIB said.

The board increased premiums for those who retire before they're eligible for Medicare, or before age 65, by $10 a month for individual coverage and $20 a month for family coverage.

It increased the premiums for surviving spouses by the same amounts.

The board also approved a new $50 premium for spouses who use tobacco.

Premiums for active employees will otherwise remain unchanged. They are $90 a month for individual coverage and $280 a month for family coverage, before discounts for non-tobacco users and for participation in a wellness program.

The changes take effect Jan. 1. The changes are less extensive than those the board approved last year to cover a larger deficit.

The board plans to meet in November to consider cost-saving measures for 2016.
