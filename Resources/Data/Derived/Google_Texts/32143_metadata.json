Without a computer and adequate Wi-Fi, completing homework was difficult in the motel room. That\u2019s when the school district, which tracks and helps the homeless children population, found a business donor to purchase him a laptop.\n\n\u201cI walk to friends\u2019 houses to use their Wi-Fi,\u201d said McCarthy, now 18, who hopes to graduate in June and then apply for grants and assistance that might allow him to start courses at the College of Central Florida in the fall.\n\nMcCarthy is one of 2,181 Marion County students considered homeless as defined by the federal McKinney-Vento Act. It says children are homeless if they lack a regular nighttime residence.\n\nSo that covers children who live with friends or relatives, or in motels. It covers kids whose \u201chome\u201d is a campground, a shelter, foster care \u2014 or the streets.\n\nCurrently in Marion County, there are 1,762 children living with relatives or friends, 206 in motels and another 175 in emergency shelters. Officials estimate another 28 live in cars or on the street and 10 are in foster care, for a total of 2,181 considered homeless.\n\nMarion was ranked fourth among medium and large counties statewide in the percentage of school-age homeless children in December 2013, the latest data available for all districts.\n\nIn December 2013, Marion reported it had 2,373 homeless children \u2014 5.6 percent of the district\u2019s 42,109 students that year. That is more than double the state average of 2.6 percent.\n\nOnly Osceola (8.5 percent), Lake (7.7) and Santa Rosa (6.9) had a higher percentage of homeless children, according to Florida Department of Education statistics.\n\nSuzanne McGuire, the school district\u2019s homeless children liaison, said the number of homeless children has risen sharply since the national recession hit in late 2007.\n\nIn December 2007, there were 1,060 homeless students \u2014 2.5 percent of the 42,692 public school students. The number has doubled in eight years.\n\nThe number peaked in December 2012, when there were 2,575 homeless students in the school district, she noted.\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nMcGuire said though many residents may not consider someone homeless if he lives with friends or family, or even in a motel, the law defines the situation as homeless.\n\nMcGuire said the leading contributors to homelessness are loss of jobs, domestic violence, fire, and medical emergencies. Also, many people have had work hours cut since the Affordable Health Care Act was passed, she said. Businesses are required to offer health insurance to employees who work more than 28 hours per week.\n\n\u201cMany businesses cut employee hours from 40 to 28,\u201d said McGuire, adding most of these jobs paid minimum wage. \u201cAfter taxes, their wages could no longer support the household.\u201d\n\nA person getting paid $8 per hour in a 40-hour week receives about $1,034 per month after taxes, McGuire estimated. Now, that same person receives about $708 per month after taxes for 28 hours.\n\n\u201cThat causes more families to become in need of help,\u201d McGuire said. \u201cWe do all we can here.\u201d\n\nMcGuire\u2019s office collects donations of clothing and other items for the students. She said families living with relatives or friends are considered homeless because they are relying on other people to survive. And, in most cases, the additional people in the household causes a financial strain on the host family.\n\nThe district does provide out-of-zone bus transportation for homeless children so they can go to the school they attended before becoming homeless. The idea is that the children have gone through enough and should not be forced to switch schools.\n\nOne of the biggest issues for children, especially those in high school, is the lack of educational resources to do basic assignments.\n\nMcGuire said most shelters do have tutors, computers and Wi-Fi for students. Others living with friends and family must get a ride to a library if that home does not have Wi-Fi. Teachers aware of the situation usually allow students to visit the school library more often to work on assignments.\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nMcGuire said she is now seeing a rise in what officials call \u201chomeless unaccompanied\u201d children \u2014 often abandoned teenagers who do not have a legal guardian.\n\nAccording to a U.S. Department of Education report released last fall, there were 1.2 million public school homeless students around the country in 2012-13. That was an 8 percent increase over the previous school year.\n\nSince the recession hit, there has been an 85 percent increase of homeless children nationwide.\n\nThe report shows there also is a rise in the number of unaccompanied youths, like McGuire is seeing locally. The report states that there were more than 75,000 unaccompanied homeless youths in 2013.\n\nBefore a Florida law passed last year, it was hard for the district to get these students medical treatment. That\u2019s because doctors and hospitals require consent from the child\u2019s parent or guardian. The law allows the school district to become that legal guardian.\n\n\u201cThat has made a huge difference,\u201d McGuire said.\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nNow that McCarthy turned 18 years old, he has become what is known as a \u201ccouch surfer,\u201d spending about five nights a week at a friend\u2019s house. McCarthy says a good night sleep on a couch is better than on motel room floor.\n\n\u201cI spend a couple of nights a week with my family at the motel,\u201d he said.\n\nSchool district social workers and guidance counselors assist the students and their families through donations and seeking help from area agencies, such as Interfaith Emergency Services, the Salvation Army and Brothers Keeper.\n\nSimone Winkler, a social worker assistant who works with McCarthy, said she visits the family several times a month, bringing them food and other needed items.\n\nShe said families who live with friends, family or in motels cannot get housing assistance because they live in places that have electricity and other utilities. Area agencies are forced to help those living in temporary shelters or on the streets to get into apartments or other rentals.\n\n\u201cThere is a big need out there,\u201d Winkler said. \u201cPeople living in motels are not viewed as needing as much help.\u201d\n\nKarla Grimsley, executive director of Interfaith, said the issue is \u201ca very frustrating thing for our staff as well.\u201d\n\nGrimsley said federal laws are specific in terms of helping families pay rent and utilities, or to help them transition into an apartment or rental.\n\nSeveral local agencies utilize federal Housing and Urban Development grants to help homeless families pay for deposits and rent.\n\n\u201cThe problem is that the money comes with guidelines about who can qualify and they define homeless as someone living in a homeless shelter or in a place not suitable for human habitation,\u201d said Grimsley, referring to cars, the woods or under a bridge. \u201cThis rules out lots of people who have a little income, but are giving a chunk of that to a hotel every month, which leaves them with very little to save toward their deposits.\u201d\n\nMcCarthy\u2019s family, for example, pays $225 a week at the motel; if they paid for a month at a time, the fee would be $600, but they have difficulty saving up that much.\n\n\u201cIf they are living in their car we can help them, but if they are in a hotel or on a friend\u2019s couch, we cannot,\u201d Grimsley said. \u201cIt\u2019s out of our control, as we are bound to HUD\u2019s rules for the grant.\u201d\n\nThe homeless children population usually drops slightly in the spring, when income tax refunds allow families to try to make it on their own. Winkler said McCarthy\u2019s family used income tax refund money in 2014 to rent a house. A month after moving in, a tree fell and damaged the home. The family was not refunded their money, and back to the motel they went.\n\n\u201cThis year, they purchased a (used) car,\u201d Winkler said. \u201cNow they can go to the store to get groceries.\u201d\n\nWinkler said before purchasing the car, the family walked to convenience stores to buy food with food stamps. Even though they can buy quality groceries, the family has little in the way of being able to cook quality meals in a motel room.\n\nGrimsley said if there were more shelter beds in Marion County, families could go there and then possibly get HUD assistance.\n\nGrimsley said her agency does treat those living in hotels just like any other person seeking their services, which is to help with food, medicine, hygiene and clothing.\n\nJoe Callahan can be reached at 867-4113 or at joe.callahan@starbanner.com.
