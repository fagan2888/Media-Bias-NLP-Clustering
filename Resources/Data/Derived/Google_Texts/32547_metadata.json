Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), among others, to the floor in support. On Syria, Paul was out front in his opposition to a military strike \u2014 a position that more than two dozen of his Republican Senate colleagues came to share.\n\nPaul, in short, seems to be a step or two in front of the ongoing transformation of the Republican Party from a hawkish conservatism to a sort of populist libertarianism.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say, of course, that significant strains of resistance to the vision of the Republican Party that Paul is offering don\u2019t remain. They do. And it remains to be seen whether the establishment, such as it is \u2014 elected officials and major donors, primarily \u2014 can unite to keep Paul from the nomination in favor of a politically \u201csafer\u201d choice such as Rubio or New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.\n\nAnd Paul, as he showed with his civil rights comments during his 2010 Senate campaign in Kentucky, holds some controversial views that can \u2014 and will \u2014 get him into trouble in the glare of the national spotlight.\n\nBut anyone who laughs at Paul as a serious contender, dismisses him as just a carbon copy of his father \u2014 former representative Ron Paul (R-Tex.) \u2014 or otherwise writes him off would do well to study the year in politics so far. No one in the GOP has had a better year than Paul. And it\u2019s not all that close.\n\nBelow are our rankings of the 10 candidates with the best chance of winding up as the Republican presidential nominee. While this should go without saying, making predictions in 2013 about 2016 is something short of purely scientific.\n\n10. Mike Pence: The Indiana governor is flying way under the radar at the moment, but he has the makings of a potential 2016 dark horse. Social and fiscal conservatives like him, he\u2019s a charismatic communicator and, perhaps most important, he doesn\u2019t work in Washington.\n\n9. John Kasich: The Ohio governor\u2019s poll numbers have recovered remarkably well from his first few years in office, and he now looks like a modest favorite for reelection against much-touted Democratic nominee Ed FitzGerald. If Kasich wins in 2014, he has a case to make as a swing-state Midwestern governor who previously served as the chairman of the House Budget Committee and who ran, albeit briefly, for president in 2000.\n\n8. Bobby Jindal: We believe that Jindal\u2019s stock was probably a bit too high a year ago and is now a bit too low. His numbers in Louisiana still aren\u2019t great, but they are better than earlier this year. Jindal\u2019s decision to reject Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act will be a feather in his cap among conservative presidential-primary voters.\n\n7. Scott Walker : The Wisconsin governor may have a bit more of a reelection race on his hands than he originally thought with wealthy former Trek executive Mary Burke running for the Democratic nomination. And we hear from reliable Wisconsin sources that Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) is more interested in running than we believed. If Ryan runs, it\u2019s hard to see Walker also getting in.\n\n6. Ted Cruz : Cruz is the biggest attraction among rank-and-file Republicans at the moment. He evokes genuine passion among the base \u2014 and that\u2019s not ever to be underestimated. But it\u2019s also worth remembering that Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.) held that title once upon a time, and she held it much closer to the time when people were actually set to cast votes for president.\n\n5. Jeb Bush: This is our holding-pattern ranking for the former Florida governor. If he announces that he\u2019s running or even that he\u2019s moving toward running \u2014 heck, we\u2019d take a Bush trip to Iowa, New Hampshire or South Carolina \u2014 then he is probably our No. 1 on the list.\n\n4. Paul Ryan: See the note above about our previous underestimating of Ryan\u2019s interest in running. The coming fights over the government shutdown and raising the debt ceiling are ready-made for Ryan and will (re)increase his profile nationally. We still are skeptical that he has the political chops to run a two-year-plus campaign for the Republican nomination, though.\n\n3. Marco Rubio: Rubio\u2019s front-runner status has clearly come into question in the aftermath of his work to pass comprehensive immigration reform through the Senate. The bill\u2019s fate remains decidedly uncertain in the GOP-controlled House and is still not popular among the party\u2019s grass roots. For those who write off Rubio because of immigration, however, go back and watch his speech at the 2012 Republican National Convention. He is someone of considerable political talent.\n\n2. Chris Christie: Yes, Christie has something of a base problem given the false idea that he somehow cost Mitt Romney the 2012 election because of his embrace of President Obama after Hurricane Sandy. But Christie\u2019s regular-guy populism is a nice fit for the times.\n\n1. Rand Paul: He\u2019s not a clear front-runner. But, if you are looking for a candidate who can (a) raise the money, (b) has a clear and compelling message and (c) has an obvious edge in an early state (Iowa), then Paul is the only person in the top three who checks all three boxes.
