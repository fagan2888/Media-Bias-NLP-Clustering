Ben Sasse, a 43-year-old conservative from Nebraska and former university president who possesses five college degrees, didn\u2019t need to experience Congress very long to learn that the institution is broken.\n\nBut Sasse, who refers to himself as a \u201chistorian by training,\u201d decided he would reject the norms of today and return to tradition by not sharing his views on how to fix the Senate\u2014what he came here to do\u2014until nearly a year into his service.\n\nSasse, the only freshman senator who, until Tuesday, hadn\u2019t spoken on the Senate floor, thought it best to spend the first year of his term listening, so that when he finally delivered, it would carry impact.\n\n\u201cI believe that a cultural recovery inside the Senate is a partial prerequisite for a national recovery,\u201d said Sasse, whose 4,244-word speech drew a live audience that included Democrats and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.\n\n\u201cDo we think the founders would have regarded a 9-percent congressional approval rating\u2014a stunning level of distrust in representative government\u2014as an existential crisis? Do we? Is it conceivable that we can get away with just drifting into the future, or is it essential that we fix this? Count me emphatically among those who think we need to fix it. We should not be OK with this. The people despise us all.\u201d\n\nSasse said that until a few decades ago, it was traditional for new senators to wait a year to speak before their colleagues. That\u2019s changed in recent years, with some senators delivering their maiden speeches shortly after they arrive in Washington.\n\nIn a symbolic move, Sasse upended that norm, because he believes that solving the complex problems of today requires less political theater and more open-minded patience.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that generational problems like the absence of a long-term strategy for combating jihad and cyber-war; like telling the truth about entitlement over-promising; like developing new human capital and job retraining strategies for the emerging era of much more rapid job change\u2014I don\u2019t think these long-term problems are solvable without a functioning Senate,\u201d Sasse said. \u201cAnd a functioning Senate is a place that rejects short-termism, both in substance and in tone.\u201d\n\nSasse has been honing this message for a while, and he\u2019s earning notice for how he delivers it.\n\nIn colorful terms, using a unique medium, Sasse last month took to his personal Twitter account to offer an epic rant criticizing House lawmakers and the media regarding how they were talking about the speaker race.\n\nIn one of a succession of 29 tweets, Sasse called for the next speaker to be the \u201cchief STORYTELLER\u201d of \u201cthe whole nation.\u201d\n\nHouseSpeaker should b Congress\u2019 chief STORYTELLER -cast the big vision of American exceptionalism; remind nation who we are/what we're about \u2014 Ben Sasse (@BenSasse) October 5, 2015\n\nSasse\u2019s lobbying seemed to succeed, even if unintentionally, because eventually Rep. Paul Ryan emerged to become speaker of the House.\n\nRyan, like Sasse, believes it\u2019s important for lawmakers to communicate their vision for the country in a compelling way and to participate in meaningful debate that lets the best idea emerge.\n\nSasse quoted from the speech Ryan, R-Wis., gave upon being elected speaker: \u201cI believe a greater clarity between us can lead to a greater charity among us.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a message that has also been promoted by the conservative House Freedom Caucus, and it\u2019s inspired Ryan to consider a host of rule changes meant to empower members and encourage ideas.\n\n>>>Why Conservatives Might Not Demand a Conservative Speaker\n\n\u201cCan you imagine a business strategist who presents just one idea, and then immediately announces that it is the only right idea, the only plausible idea?\u201d said Sasse, who was also a former corporate consultant known as a turnaround artist.\n\n\u201cHow would companies respond? They would fire that guy. A good strategist, by contrast, puts the best construction on a range of scenarios and outlines the best criticisms of each option, including especially the option he or she wants to argue for most passionately. But bizarrely, we don\u2019t really do this very much here. We don\u2019t have many actual debates. This is a place that would be difficult today to describe as \u2018the greatest deliberative body in the world\u2019\u2014something that has often been true historically.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is not a call for less fighting, but for more meaningful fighting,\u201d Sasse added.\n\nSasse believes that Congress should be about serving the people. He likes to remind people that he is one of those people.\n\nHe shops for groceries and attends church with \u201cold people back home who are not worried about if they get $809 or $813 in their monthly Social Security check, but are worried about the country they are leaving their grandkids,\u201d he once told The Daily Signal.\n\nWhen he says he\u2019s \u201ctotally new to politics,\u201d he means it to be endearing. An elected official, after all, is one of us, but lawmakers need to do a better job of showing it, Sasse said.\n\n\u201cBeyond policy advocating and policy clarifying, we need an overarching narrative,\u201d Sasse said. \u201cWe need to pause to regularly recall the larger American principles that bind us together\u2014our Constitutional creed, our shared stories, and our exceptional American dream of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness for all 320 million of our countrymen.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Defying traditional norms, Sen.
