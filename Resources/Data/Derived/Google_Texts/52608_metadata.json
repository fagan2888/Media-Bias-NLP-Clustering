The magazine said the retailers and brands won\u2019t influence whether or how it reviews a product.\n\nThe efforts come as the average person age 15 and older spends just 19 minutes a day reading, compared to 45 minutes a day shopping, according to the Labor Department\u2019s American Time Use Survey.\n\nBetter technology and easier payment services make it possible for online publications and video services to process payments and operate more like e-commerce companies.\n\nEarlier this year, Conde Nast said it would merge its Lucky shopping magazine with online retailer BeachMint Inc. to allow readers to shop directly from the Lucky website by 2015. Meanwhile, luxury online retailer Net-A-Porter in February launched a glossy print fashion magazine after its research showed women preferred to read about fashion on glossy magazines even as they shop online.\n\nStill, publishers have long struggled with how to achieve widespread adoption of shoppable magazines and videos.\n\nAllure initially started refashioning its website into an e-commerce shop four years ago but \u201cI think we were ahead of the technology,\u201d said Editor in Chief Linda Wells.\n\nThe magazine partnered with beauty websites Soap.com and BeautyBar.com, which are owned by Amazon.com Inc., to allow readers to hit a shop button whenever products mentioned on Allure.com were available for purchase at its partner websites.\n\nBut the partnership only gave readers access to 40% of the products on Allure.com and required readers to leave Allure\u2019s website and go through a number of steps to buy the product, raising the risk they might not navigate back to Allure, Ms. Wells said.\n\n\u201cWe feel more confident this time, because Wal-Mart and Saks carry a much bigger assortment for both mass market and prestige brands, and the technology has caught up to make it an easier experience for shoppers,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "n the latest attempt to blend editorial content with commerce, Allure is working with MasterCard Inc. to allow readers to purchase products like lipstick and skin cream directly from its website and mobile app.", "title": "Magazine Are Trying To Turn Readers Into Shoppers", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/cmo/2014/11/03/magazine-are-trying-to-turn-readers-into-shoppers/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-FI718_CMOmag_G_20141103153711.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "CSuite", "article.headline": "Magazine Are Trying To Turn Readers Into Shoppers", "description": "n the latest attempt to blend editorial content with commerce, Allure is working with MasterCard Inc. to allow readers to purchase products like lipstick and skin cream directly from its website and mobile app.", "article_section": "CSuite", "author": "Shelly Banjo", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "CMO Today Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "CMO Today", "article.summary": "n the latest attempt to blend editorial content with commerce, Allure is working with MasterCard Inc. to allow readers to purchase products like lipstick and skin cream directly from its website and mobile app.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-11-03T20:34:40-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-143", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/cmo/2014/11/03/magazine-are-trying-to-turn-readers-into-shoppers/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-269B-1971", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "CSuite", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "n the latest attempt to blend editorial content with commerce, Allure is working with MasterCard Inc. to allow readers to purchase products like lipstick and skin cream directly from its website and mobile app.", "title": "Magazine Are Trying To Turn Readers Into Shoppers", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/cmo/2014/11/03/magazine-are-trying-to-turn-readers-into-shoppers/", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-FI718_CMOmag_G_20141103153711.jpg", "height": 369}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "CMO Today", "article.id": "BL-269B-1971", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-11-03T22:04:12-05:00"}, "article_summary": "Earlier this year, Conde Nast said it would merge its Lucky shopping magazine with online retailer BeachMint Inc. to allow readers to shop directly from the Lucky website by 2015.\n\u201cOnline retailers spend a lot of money and time trying to drive traffic and get eyeballs,\u201d said Bryan Barley, president of online skincare company SkinCareRx.com that will sell its goods through Allure\u2019s ShopThis program.\nMeanwhile, luxury online retailer Net-A-Porter in February launched a glossy print fashion magazine after its research showed women preferred to read about fashion on glossy magazines even as they shop online.\nThe magazine said the retailers and brands won\u2019t influence whether or how it reviews a product.\nOrders will be fulfilled by retailers including Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Hudson\u2019s Bay Co.\u2019s Saks Fifth Avenue."}
