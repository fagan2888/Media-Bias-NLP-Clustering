Although not taking any chances and staying away from the protesters (paid and otherwise) Trump spoke to reporters aboard his jet before he addressed a packed rally at Janesville\u2019s Holiday Inn Express.\n\nRELATED: Feeling the Burn? $15-an-hour minimum wage to protest Trump\n\nThe big conservative prize Tuesday went to Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who picked up the endorsement of Wisconsin Republican Gov. Scott Walker.\n\n\u201cAfter eight years of the failed Obama-Clinton administration, Americans are looking for real leadership and a new direction. Ted Cruz is a principled constitutional conservative who understands that power belongs to the states \u2013 and to the people \u2013 and not bureaucrats in Washington,\u201d Walker said Tuesday morning in a statement. \u201cJust like we did in Wisconsin, Ted Cruz is not afraid to challenge the status quo and to stand up against the big government special interests. He is the best-positioned candidate to both win the Republican nomination and defeat Hillary Clinton. That\u2019s why I endorse Ted Cruz for President of the United States.\u201d\n\nTrump shrugged off the endorsement from a former presidential candidate who was one of the first to exit it the once-crowded contest. Despite being challenged, if not chastened, by some of Wisconsin\u2019s best conservative talk show hosts Monday, Trump still was playing fast and loose with the facts about Walker and the state of Wisconsin\u2019s fiscal house Tuesday.\n\nCruz and Trump were running nearly neck and neck, according to the latest polls, with Ohio Gov. John Kasich lagging the field, in the Badger State delegates chase.\n\nTuesday\u2019s campaign was marked by the surreal and the sublime. The candidates rallied around Wisconsin in advance of Tuesday evening\u2019s scheduled CNN Town Hall in Milwaukee.\n\n\u201cDonald, why don\u2019t you show up and debate like a man?\u201d Cruz said at a rally Monday evening in Rothschild, calling on Trump to debate him one-on-one.\n\nAs of this post, it wasn\u2019t certain that Trump would show up to the event. Kasich would. But like Richard Gere in \u201cAn Officer and a Gentleman,\u201d Kasich, who has won a single state \u2013 his own \u2013 really had nowhere else to go.\n\nKasich reportedly already had begun pulling some of his ads in Wisconsin, training them on congressional districts in the state\u2019s not-so-winner-take all primary system. He hung out in Waukesha on Tuesday, not far from Milwaukee, to be ready for Tuesday evening\u2019s town hall. Kasich basked in the afterglow of his endorsement from former Navy Secretary John F. Lehman Jr.\n\nAnd just in case no one was listening \u2013 and they weren\u2019t \u2013 Libertarian White House hopeful Gary Johnson predicted President Barack Obama will reclassify marijuana on his way out of office.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be just like alcohol,\u201d Johnson told The Washington Times on Tuesday. \u201cI\u2019m going to predict that Obama, when he leaves office, is going to deschedule marijuana as a Class I narcotic. I wish he would have done that to this point, but I think he\u2019s going to do that going out the door. That\u2019s a positive.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Dispatches from primary Wisconsin", "title": "On Wisconsin!
