New Prep Method Looks to Make Colonoscopy Easier to Swallow

For anyone who has undergone a colonoscopy the worst part of the procedure is usually the preparation. Between the fluids that need to be ingested and the necessary fasting, it can be a long process before ever seeing the doctor. A recent pilot study looked at ways to change that.L. Campbell Levy, from Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, discussed how this inital work could provide a great benefit if further studies follow the same results during Digestive Disease Week 2015 in Washington DC. Levy said that because people are often scared away by the preparation process, some patients who might need the test the most do not receive the help they ultimately require.
