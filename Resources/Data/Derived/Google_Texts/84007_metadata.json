Most parents would never consider letting their kids drink coffee.\n\nThe reason why one caffeinated beverage is allowed, and the other forbidden? Because everyone knows, of course, that drinking coffee stunts the growth of children.\n\nAs much as we hate to give argumentative kids more ammo in undermining their parents, we love dispelling cherished scientific misconceptions. Despite decades of research into the effects of coffee drinking, there is absolutely no evidence that it stunts kids\u2019 growth.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s \u2018common knowledge,\u2019 so to speak\u2014but a lot of common knowledge doesn\u2019t turn out to be true,\u201d says Mark Pendergrast, the author of Uncommon Grounds: The History of Coffee and How It Transformed Our World. \u201cTo my knowledge, no one has ever turned up evidence that drinking coffee has any effect on how much children grow.\u201d\n\nThat said, there isn\u2019t strong evidence that coffee doesn\u2019t stunt growth, simply because the long-term effects of coffee on children haven\u2019t been thoroughly studied (in part, presumably, because it\u2019d be hard to find a parent willing to make his or her kid drink coffee daily for years at a time). There has, however, been research into the long-term effects of caffeine on children, and no damning evidence has turned up. One study followed 81 adolescents for a six-year period, and found no correlation between daily caffeine intake and bone growth or density.\n\nTheoretically, the closest thing we do have to evidence that caffeine affects growth is a series of studies on adults, which show that increased consumption of caffeinated beverages lead to the body absorbing slightly less calcium, which is necessary for bone growth. However, the effect is negligible: The calcium in a mere tablespoon of milk, it\u2019s estimated, is enough to offset the caffeine in eight ounces of coffee. Official NIH recommendations state that, paired with a diet sufficient in calcium, moderate caffeine consumption has no negative effects on bone formation.\n\nBut if the whole coffee stunting growth idea isn\u2019t rooted in science, where did it come from? Shrewdly calculated advertising.\n\n\u201cFrom the very beginning of people drinking coffee, there have been concerns that it was bad for you, for one reason or another,\u201d Pendergrast says, noting that coffee was banned for health reasons as far back as the 1500s, in Mecca, and in 1675, by King Charles of England.\n\nModern concerns about coffee\u2019 health effects in the U.S. can be traced to C.W. Post, an 1800s-era food manufacturer most well known for pioneering the field of breakfast cereal. He also invented a grain-based breakfast beverage called Postum, advertised as a caffeine-free coffee alternative, that was popular through the 1960s (and is still in production).", "article_metadata": {"description": "Modern concerns about the beverage's health effects can be traced back to a 19th century advertising campaign", "title": "It\u2019s a myth: There\u2019s no evidence coffee stunts kids\u2019 growth", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Modern concerns about the beverage's health effects can be traced back to a 19th century advertising campaign", "title": "It\u2019s a myth: There\u2019s no evidence coffee stunts kids\u2019 growth", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/12/21/your_parents_lied_there_is_no_evidence_that_coffee_stunts_kids_growth_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2012/11/Coffee_Beans_Photographed_in_Macro.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Modern concerns about the beverage's health effects can be traced back to a 19th century advertising campaign", "title": "It\u2019s a myth: There\u2019s no evidence coffee stunts kids\u2019 growth", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2012/11/Coffee_Beans_Photographed_in_Macro.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Joseph Stromberg", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Coffee, evidence, false advertising, growth, Health, kids, myths, Parenting, Science, Smithsonian.com, study", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdeaa6\"", "article_summary": "Despite decades of research into the effects of coffee drinking, there is absolutely no evidence that it stunts kids\u2019 growth.\nBecause everyone knows, of course, that drinking coffee stunts the growth of children.\nTopics: Coffee, evidence, false advertising, growth, Health, kids, myths, Parenting, Science, Smithsonian.com, study, Life NewsThis article originally appeared on Smithsonian.comMany parents, on special occasions, let their children drink Coke, Pepsi, or other sugary drinks.\nBut if the whole coffee stunting growth idea isn\u2019t rooted in science, where did it come from?\nThere has, however, been research into the long-term effects of caffeine on children, and no damning evidence has turned up."}
