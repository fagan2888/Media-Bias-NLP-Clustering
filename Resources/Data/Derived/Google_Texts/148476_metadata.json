For some, it\u2019s a passion for the issues. For others, it\u2019s the family business. Many politicians talk about hearing \u201ca calling\u201d for public service.\n\nIn Minnesota last week, Republican Aaron Miller was a surprise victor in the race to take on Rep. Tim Walz (D) this year, and after securing the nomination, Miller talked a bit about why he\u2019s running. He mentioned, for example, that he wants to reduce the deficit and repeal the Affordable Care Act, which would be tricky, since repealing the ACA would make the deficit go up quite a bit.\n\nBut as the Mankato Free Press noted, that\u2019s not the only thing driving Miller\u2019s candidacy\n\nHe also called for more religious freedoms. He repeated his story about his daughter returning home from school because evolution was being taught in her class. He said the teacher admitted to not believing in the scientific theory to his daughter but told her that the government forced him to teach the lesson. \u201cWe should decide what is taught in our schools, not Washington D.C.,\u201d Miller said. Miller has declined to provide any more information to verify his story.\n\nAs Tim Murphy noted , this wasn\u2019t the first time Miller, a hospital account manager and Iraq War veteran, \u201crecounted this tale \u2013 it\u2019s a staple of his stump speech.\u201d\n\nAnd for a variety of reasons, that\u2019s a real shame.\n\nFirst, if Miller\u2019s daughter\u2019s science teacher doesn\u2019t believe in modern biology, and admits as much to his or her science class, Miller might want to have a chat with the local school board.\n\nSecond, if Miller believes federal policymakers in Washington are responsible for dictating curricula in Mankato, Minn., he\u2019s been misinformed about the basics of educational policymaking. In reality, Minnesotans decide what\u2019s taught in Minnesota\u2019s public schools. Those who intend to go to Congress to help shut down federally mandated science classes are likely to be disappointed.\n\nAnd finally, it is the 21st century. Complaining about science in science classes just doesn\u2019t seem like a compelling rationale for a congressional candidacy.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Complaining about science in science classes just doesn't seem like a compelling rationale for a congressional candidacy.", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/aaron-millers-minnesota-platform", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "Complaining about science in science classes just doesn't seem like a compelling rationale for a congressional candidacy.", "title": "Aaron Miller's Minnesota platform", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/aaron-millers-minnesota-platform", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/articles/9041246.jpg?itok=fML6I1kB", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/aaron-millers-minnesota-platform", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/articles/9041246.jpg?itok=kOkiVAEH", "title": "Aaron Miller's Minnesota platform", "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Complaining about science in science classes just doesn't seem like a compelling rationale for a congressional candidacy."}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2014-04-08T16:48:00-04:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "nv": {"author": "steve-benen", "title": "Aaron Miller's Minnesota platform", "tags": "creationism,election-2014,elections,minnesota,rachel-maddow-show", "published": 1, "date": "04/08/2014 16:48:00 EDT", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/aaron-millers-minnesota-platform"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/steve.benen"}, "abstract": "Complaining about science in science classes just doesn't seem like a compelling rationale for a congressional candidacy.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Elections, Election 2014, Creationism, Minnesota"}, "article_summary": "Complaining about science in science classes just doesn\u2019t seem like a compelling rationale for a congressional candidacy.\nBut as the Mankato Free Press noted, that\u2019s not the only thing driving Miller\u2019s candidacyHe also called for more religious freedoms.\nFirst, if Miller\u2019s daughter\u2019s science teacher doesn\u2019t believe in modern biology, and admits as much to his or her science class, Miller might want to have a chat with the local school board.\n\u201cWe should decide what is taught in our schools, not Washington D.C.,\u201d Miller said.\nIn Minnesota last week, Republican Aaron Miller was a surprise victor in the race to take on Rep.
