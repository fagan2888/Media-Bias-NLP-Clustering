Befuddled by Obamacare?

Two enrollment centers — one in Edison, the other in Wayne — will now be open seven days a week to help people enroll for health insurance through the federal marketplace.

The centers are operated by SRA, one of the firms contracted by the federal government to help with the enrollment process. Many hospitals and community groups also have trained navigators to help with the process.

The SRA walk-in centers will be open on weekdays from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., and on weekends from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.

The deadline is Dec. 23 for those who want health insurance that will go into effect Jan. 1.

The Edison enrollment assistance center is at 1719 State Route 27, Festival Plaza.

The Wayne center is at 1211 Hamburg Turnpike, Suite 301.
