Fred Upton (R-Mich.), the committee\u2019s chairman, said in a statement. \u201cThe sooner we say yes to energy, the sooner we can take full advantage of America\u2019s energy abundance and bring our policies into the 21st century to create jobs and keep energy affordable.\u201d\n\nIf lawmakers are successful, they could pass the first major energy legislation since 2007.\n\nThe 95-page package includes a number of provisions that Republicans and Democrats alike have supported at some point. The Obama administration has also expressed a desire for legislation to address some of the issues in the bill, especially in its major energy infrastructure report from May.\n\nIt would streamline the permitting process for natural gas pipelines in an attempt to better transport the historically large volume of gas being produced domestically.\n\nPower utilities would be freer to violate environmental laws if necessary to maintain electric reliability.\n\nThe bill includes various proposals to modernize the electric grid, such as pushing utilities to better prepare for power disruptions and giving the secretary of Energy emergency power to respond to threats to the grid.\n\nThe package is the first result of months of hearings lawmakers have held this year.\n\nThe Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee is working toward its own energy policy reform package that is likely to be unveiled before lawmakers leave for their August recess.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "A committee will mark up the legislation on Wednesday.", "description": "A committee will mark up the legislation on Wednesday.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Timothy Cama", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "A committee will mark up the legislation on Wednesday.", "title": "House GOP unveils energy reform package", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/248606-house-gop-unveils-energy-reform-package", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-07-21T14:12:05-04:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2015-07-21T14:12-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/248606-house-gop-unveils-energy-reform-package", "dcterms.date": "2015-07-21T09:15-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Timothy Cama", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "House Energy and Commerce Committee, pipelines, electric grid,Fred Upton,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-21T09:15:12-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-21T14:12:05-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/248606-house-gop-unveils-energy-reform-package", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "A committee will mark up the legislation on Wednesday.", "card": "summary", "title": "House GOP unveils energy reform package"}, "dcterms.title": "House GOP unveils energy reform package"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce53f\"", "article_summary": "House Republicans have unveiled a package of bills aimed at bringing the country\u2019s energy infrastructure, reliability and other energy matters into the modern era.\nThe Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee is working toward its own energy policy reform package that is likely to be unveiled before lawmakers leave for their August recess.\nPower utilities would be freer to violate environmental laws if necessary to maintain electric reliability.\n\u201cThe sooner we say yes to energy, the sooner we can take full advantage of America\u2019s energy abundance and bring our policies into the 21st century to create jobs and keep energy affordable.\u201dIf lawmakers are successful, they could pass the first major energy legislation since 2007.\nADVERTISEMENTAfter unveiling the package Monday night, the committee announced that its subcommittee on energy and power will start to consider and vote on four sections of the bill Wednesday."}
