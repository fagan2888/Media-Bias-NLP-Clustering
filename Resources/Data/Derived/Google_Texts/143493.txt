Two men died, and one child was injured Friday afternoon in a head-on collision in Custer County.

The Oklahoma Highway Patrol said the collision occurred around 4:50 p.m. Friday on U.S. Highway 183, about two miles north of Arapaho.

According to OHP, 24-year-old Shaun Derek Elston of Clinton was traveling southbound on U.S. Highway 183 and drove up behind a pickup, driven by 70-year-old Kenn Drew Sipe of Gage.

Troopers said Sipe moved to the right to avoid being rear ended, but Elston hit Sipe's pickup, causing Elston's car to veer left of center and hit another pickup head on. The other pickup was driven by 60-year-old Gary Leon Cordes of Minot, ND, and there was also a 13-year-old passenger of Wolfforth, TX.

Elston and Cordes were pronounced dead at the scene due to massive bodily injuries sustained in the collision, according to OHP. The 13-year-old passenger was transported to OU Medical Center and is in stable condition. Sipe was not injured in the collision.

As stated in the report, the cause of the collision and the condition of the driver is under investigation.

The Custer County Sheriff's Department, Clinton Fire Department, Arapaho Fire Department and the Sinor EMS assisted the Oklahoma Highway Patrol with this investigation.
