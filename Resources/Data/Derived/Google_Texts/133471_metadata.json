Their paychecks are being financed by the state for at least 10 days under a $362,700 agreement Gov. John Hickenlooper struck with the Department of the Interior on Friday.\n\nEstes Park rejoiced in the return of the town\u2019s economic driver.\n\n\u201cI already see a significant difference today,\u201d Gary Bien said by phone as he watched people stroll the main drag in front of his son\u2019s store, Kirks Flyshop and Mountain Adventures.\n\nHe could hardly spare a second between customers on Saturday \u2014 a massive improvement. The Estes Park shop\u2019s sales had dropped off 75 percent in the last 30 days compared with 2012.\n\nFishing and backpacking tours can resume in the park now that it\u2019s open.\n\nThe fishing has been outstanding along the Big Thompson River in town, Bien said. Most years, two people on a trip catch about 12 fish, he said. Since the flood washed fish from stocked lakes down the river, Bien said his tours have been catching 45-50 fish, and he expects even bigger hauls inside the park.\n\nThe park\u2019s closure compounded the economic impact that flooding brought Estes Park in mid-September, according to Brooke Burnham, communications director at Visit Estes Park. Potential visitors were put off by confusion over whether the park and town were open and how to get there, she said.\n\nAt least 90 percent of the town\u2019s roughly 1,000 businesses have reopened since the flood, Burnham said, but have not returned to pre-flood numbers because the park was closed.\n\nThe tourism industry, two-thirds of Estes Park business, has taken a hard hit in the absence of the town\u2019s next-door natural playground.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the main reason people come to Estes Park,\u201d Burnham said.\n\nThe park closed for 13 days because of the flood and 11 days because of the shutdown. The reopening came just in time for fall leaf colors, Burnham said.\n\nFedorchak said he passed a herd of at least 90 elk on his way to work Saturday morning. Two were grunting the species\u2019 mating call \u2014 bugling, an annual rite that attracts thousands of people to the park each fall.\n\n\u201cThe weather finally cleared up, the elk are bugling, the aspens are golden. It\u2019s just such a nice day to have the park open again,\u201d Fedorchak said.\n\nU.S. 34 and U.S. 36, the typical routes into Estes Park, remain closed north of Boulder. The town is accessible by driving west on Colorado 119, then north on Peak to Peak, Colorado 72 and 7.\n\nTrail Ridge Road, which runs east-west across the Continental Divide, reopened Saturday on the west end up to Colorado River Trailhead and on the east end to Many Parks Curve, but is not open in its entirety. The road will close for winter on Oct. 24.\n\nAlison Noon: 303-954-1223, anoon@denverpost.com or twitter.com/alisonnoon", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Rocky Mountain National Park reopens to elk bugles", "title": "Rocky Mountain National Park reopens to elk bugles", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/10/12/rocky-mountain-national-park-reopens-to-elk-bugles/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131012__parkp1-1.jpg", "height": 399}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131012__parkp1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-10-12T15:44:54+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-29T10:11:06+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Estes Park took a step closer to normality Saturday as Rocky Mountain National Park temporarily reopened.\nThe park\u2019s closure compounded the economic impact that flooding brought Estes Park in mid-September, according to Brooke Burnham, communications director at Visit Estes Park.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the main reason people come to Estes Park,\u201d Burnham said.\nU.S. 34 and U.S. 36, the typical routes into Estes Park, remain closed north of Boulder.\nIt\u2019s just such a nice day to have the park open again,\u201d Fedorchak said."}
