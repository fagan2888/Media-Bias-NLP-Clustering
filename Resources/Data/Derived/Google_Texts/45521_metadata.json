So ruled a court today. Via Ars Technica:\n\nIn a unanimous decision on Wednesday, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed a lower court\u2019s decision, declaring that a Facebook \u201cLike\u201d is protected under the First Amendment, like other forms of speech. The Virginia case involves a former deputy sheriff in Hampton, Virginia, who claimed that he had been fired for \u201cliking\u201d his boss\u2019 rival in a political campaign for county sheriff. In the original lawsuit, a federal district judge tossed the case, saying that a Facebook \u201cLike\u201d was \u201cinsufficient speech to merit constitutional protection.\u201d Facebook itself filed an amicus brief in the case, urging the appeals court to reconsider the lower court\u2019s decision.\n\nThere were actually six plaintiffs in the case (pdf) who said the sheriff (who is also accused of using his office to further his own re-election efforts) refused to reappoint them after he won re-election. The most relevant paragraph of the 81-page ruling, noted by both Ars Technica and legal scholar Eugene Volokh:\n\nOn the most basic level, clicking on the \u201clike\u201d button literally causes to be published the statement that the User \u201clikes\u201d something, which is itself a substantive statement. In the context of a political campaign\u2019s Facebook page, the meaning that the user approves of the candidacy whose page is being liked is unmistakable. That a user may use a single mouse click to produce that message that he likes the page instead of typing the same message with several individual key strokes is of no constitutional significance.\n\nVolokh explains that though the court ruled a Facebook like counts as speech, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean there can\u2019t ever be consequences for for government employees for clicking that thumbs-up:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Facebook \"likes\" are a form of actual, potentially protected speech", "title": "Court Rules That Facebook Likes Say Something (and That You Are Saying Something by Liking Stuff)", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2013/09/18/judge-rules-that-liking-stuff-says-somet", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/13795376813561.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Just as giving a thumbs-up is a form\nof speech, so is clicking an online button virtually doing the same\nthing on Facebook.
