About $30 billion in non-traded real estate investment trust (REIT) funds could enter the market this year, with a significant share targeted at private-pay assisted living facilities.\n\n\u201cNew construction will limit improvements in the sector this year, resulting in a 10-basis point rise in occupancy to 91.4%,\u201d says Marcus & Millichap about its outlook for assisted living. \u201cStrong occupancy and high rents commanded by new properties will support a 2.3% gain in average rents this year to $4,268 per month.\u201d\n\nIndependent living facilities\n\nIn independent living, acute demand for apartments is spilling into the sector as buyers outnumber sellers by a wide margin, data show. And the added spread between cap rates and interest rates for these properties has been a strong selling point for investors, says Marcus & Millichap.\n\nAbout 3,000 independent living units were added to inventory during 2014, down from 4,400 units during the prior year, according to National Investment Center for Seniors Housing (NIC) MAP data. Development is rising as 11,600 units are under construction across the country, the highest level since mid-2009. Underway units represent 2.4% of existing stock.\n\n\u201cBoth occupancy and rents should improve this year as seniors unlock equity in homes and move into independent living units,\u201d says Marcus & Millichap, adding that occupancy is expected to rise 50 basis points to 92.3% by year-end 2015 while average rents advance 3.1% to $2,923 per month.\n\nSkilled nursing facilities\n\nThe skilled nursing sector is \u201cpoised for a renaissance\u201d of smaller operators in 2015, Marcus & Millichap says, noting that uncertainty took a toll on deal flow at the lower end of the quality spectrum the past few years. The current bright outlook could help investors recoup lost time.\n\n\u201cAlthough occupancy has been stuck in neutral for the past several months, a slowdown in construction will support a 30-basis point increase thisyear to 88.5%,\u201d the company says regarding its outlook for skilled nursing. \u201cRents will climb 2.1% in 2015 to $290 per bed, per day as tight government funding limits reimbursements.\u201d\n\nContinuing care retirement communities\n\nContinuing care retirement communities (CCRCs) are projected to undergo the most basis point occupancy growth, as occupancy is expected to rise 80 basis points in 2015 to 91.2%, data show.\n\n\u201cA slowdown in the housing recovery could encourage some seniors who have been on the fence about releasing equity in their homes to move forward,\u201d says Marcus & Millichap, adding that entrance fees in 2015 are expected to climb at a similar pace to 2014.\n\nEntrance fees for CCRCs were $292,000 at the end of 2014, up 4% from the same period in 2013, according to NIC Map data.\n\nAccess the report here.\n\nWritten by Cassandra Dowell", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "marcus & millichap, nic, business, finance, real estate, senior housing", "og": {"site_name": "Senior Housing News", "description": "Favorable economic and investment conditions are driving positive momentum throughout the spectrum of senior housing in 2015, new data shows.
