In honor of this scenario, we get a reminder of just how great things were in our for-profit system before all the tyrannical Kenyan Muslim jackboots stomped it flat.\n\nAll but one of the these facilities is owned by for-profit entities, and by far the largest number of hospitals \u2014 20 \u2014 are in Florida.
