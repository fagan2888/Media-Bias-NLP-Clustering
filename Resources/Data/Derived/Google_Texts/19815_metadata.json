Mike Kelley (R-Mo.) on the issue, and Kelley then contacted the Missouri National Guard.\n\n\u201cThey told me that federal policy prohibits them from doing anything with any specific church,\u201d the congressman told Fox News. \u201cThe guys on the state level did everything they could. I have great respect for our local Missouri National Guard. But we are dealing with an over-burdensome federal regulation.\u201d\n\n\u201c[Pastor Hogan] basically got blown off by the federal government,\u201d added Kelley.\n\nMissouri National Guardsmen expressed their outrage at the issue. One described himself as \u201cashamed and embarrassed\u201d and another wondered why soldiers can march in a gay pride parade but aren\u2019t allowed to visit with children at a Bible school.\n\nPastor Hogan said that the event spotlights the threat to religious liberty in America today.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think most Americans realize how much their religious liberty is in jeopardy,\u201d stated Hogan. \u201cIf they did this to us \u2013 how bad is it somewhere else? This is not just a big city issue. This is a small town America issue. Americans need to wake up.\u201d\n\nThe occurrence suggests that, while the conservative Supreme Court may defend religious liberty by handing down rulings like that for the Hobby Lobby case, religious liberty today remains under duress and needs to be constantly fought for.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "A church located in Carthage, Missouri was essentially stood up by the National Guard because the military said troops are not allowed to do anything with specific churches that would look like the Army is sponsoring a specific religion, reports Todd Starnes of Fox News.", "title": "Military prevents troops from visiting Missouri Bible school - Red...", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 400, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2012/02/tdionisopoulos_avatar-400x400.jpg", "height": 400}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2014/07/27/military-prevents-troops-visiting-missouri-bible-school/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "national-guard-visit-missouri-bible-school", "published_time": "2014-07-27T17:19:14+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-27T17:19:14+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca85d\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIt was more of a promotion for the military \u2013 to show the kids what the military does.\u201d\u201cWe were told it was against military policy for National Guard troops to participate in Vacation Bible School,\u201d continued the pastor.\n\u201cWe were going to thank them for protecting our religious liberty,\u201d Pastor Kent Hogan told the Fox News reporter.\nIt looks like the military won\u2019t be visiting your local church anytime soon.\nAmericans need to wake up.\u201dThe occurrence suggests that, while the conservative Supreme Court may defend religious liberty by handing down rulings like that for the Hobby Lobby case, religious liberty today remains under duress and needs to be constantly fought for.\nI have great respect for our local Missouri National Guard."}
