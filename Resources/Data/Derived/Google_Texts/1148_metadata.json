President Lyndon B. Johnson declared \u201cWar on Poverty.\u201d The Beatles hit U.S. shores. The World\u2019s Fair opened in New York. Health officials made the formal connection between smoking and lung cancer.\n\nAnd in 1964, on the north side of the University of South Florida campus, a set of dormitories collectively known as Andros I opened to 650 students.\n\nCollege dormitories typically don\u2019t age well, and more than five decades after they rose, the Andros dorms will face the wrecking ball and be replaced by a vibrant, live-work-play residential village with retail, restaurant and even grocery store space for 2,000 students.\n\n\u201cIt really will be transformative,\u201d said Judy Genshaft, president of the USF System. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at related activities along with it \u2014 there will be coffee shops, restaurants.\u201d\n\nConstruction is expected to begin in May 2016. The four Andros I buildings will be the first to go \u2014 the Delta, Epsilon, Eta and Zeta dorms. (The early USF dorms were named for letters of the Greek alphabet.) In their places will be a village with 1,550 semi-suite or traditional beds, a health and wellness facility, an outdoor pool and deck, dining facilities and retail spaces.\n\nIn 2018, the five Andros II buildings \u2014 the Iota, Kappa, Lambda, Mu and Theta dorms \u2014 come down, to be replaced by 575 new semi-suite or traditional beds. Phase I is slated for completion in June 2017, phase II in June 2019.\n\nIt\u2019s becoming trendy to refer to student housing as \u201cvillages,\u201d \u201cresidence centers\u201d or some more upscale term. But you can go ahead and call the Andros sites \u201cdorms.\u201d\n\nThey are functional cinderblock bunkers, most with two beds in the sleeping area, narrow hallways, study desks that aren\u2019t reached by natural light, tight showers and toilets.\n\n\u201cYou have to put up a lot of posters or you feel like you\u2019re living in a hospital,\u201d said July Soe, a freshman from Burma who lives in the Zeta hall.\n\nThe university has dressed up entryways and spruced up old flooring in the buildings, but \u201cthey just look a little tired,\u201d said Linda Kasper, director for residential life and education.\n\nA new residence hall at the University of Tampa features \u201cart boxes,\u201d study nooks, photographic displays from around the world, plenty of windows offering a sweeping panoramic view of Tampa and rooms organized in suite or loft arrangements.\n\nAt Florida Polytechnic, a residence hall quickly rose with 200 beds, most in four bedroom, two-bath units with a kitchenette described as more apartment-style than dorm-style.\n\nThe Poly hall was constructed as a private-public partnership with Jacksonville-based Vestcor Cos. That\u2019s the same arrangement USF is pursuing for the new village, with a developer bearing full risk for financing, building, furnishing and potentially operating the project. Details are being negotiated, and USF declined to name its two finalists or provide details of their proposals for competitive reasons.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really creating an environment where students can live, work and play, kind of like what Jeff Vinik is doing downtown, where they can stay and not leave on Friday nights to go home,\u201d said John Long, chief operating officer and senior vice president. \u201cThey\u2019ll have everything they need here.\u201d\n\nThe university is seeking to shed the \u201ccommuter college\u201d tag and earn classification as a primary residential campus under the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education. To do so, it must increase the percentage of degree-seeking undergrads living on campus to 25 percent.\n\nUSF Tampa has 5,589 on-campus residents. That\u2019s considered 105 percent of capacity, with a few hundred students doubled up in rooms intended to be singles.\n\nDorm dwellers represent about 14 percent of the Tampa campus\u2019 enrollment of 38,561. In 2009, the school mandated that all first-time-in-college freshmen live in campus housing unless they are over 21, married, or live in Hillsborough, Pinellas or Pasco counties.\n\nThe village concept coming to the north side of campus is expected to benefit off-campus students, as well.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re also looking at students not just on campus, but what we call \u2018resi-muters,\u2019\u201d said Genshaft. \u201cThere are about 15,000 students that live right around the university, so they can come across the street and to the village and be a part of the whole culture of the university.\u201d\n\njstockfisch@tampatrib.com\n\n(813) 259-7834", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sat, 28 Feb 2015 20:18:25 -0400", "Description": "College dormitories typically don\u2019t age well, and more than five decades after they rose, the Andros dorms will face the wrecking ball.", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "College dormitories typically don\u2019t age well, and more than five decades after they rose, the Andros dorms will face the wrecking ball.", "title": "Old USF dorms to make way for new village", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/news/education/old-usf-dorms-to-make-way-for-new-village-20150228/", "image": {"width": 1800, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20150228/ARTICLE/150229195/EP/1/2/EP-150229195.jpg", "height": 1200}, "updated_time": "2015-02-28T22:08:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "College dormitories typically don\u2019t age well, and more than five decades after they rose, the Andros dorms will face the wrecking ball.", "title": "Old USF dorms to make way for new village", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20150228/ARTICLE/150229195/AR/0/AR-150229195.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2015-02-28T20:18:25Z-04", "modified_time": "2015-02-28T22:08:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "(The early USF dorms were named for letters of the Greek alphabet.)\nUSF Tampa has 5,589 on-campus residents.\nDorm dwellers represent about 14 percent of the Tampa campus\u2019 enrollment of 38,561.\nThe village concept coming to the north side of campus is expected to benefit off-campus students, as well.\nThe four Andros I buildings will be the first to go \u2014 the Delta, Epsilon, Eta and Zeta dorms."}
