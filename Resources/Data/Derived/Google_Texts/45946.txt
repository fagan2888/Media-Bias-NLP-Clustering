Police in Claremore are getting into the holiday spirit by giving back to senior citizens.

Claremore's Fraternal Order of Police armed themselves with hairnets and spoons as they served meals at the Senior Citizen Center in Claremore.

The FOP said they chose the Senior Center because they wanted to give back to a group that is sometimes overlooked.

"Itâ€™s just kind of a nice way for them to see us as human beings and just regular guys, not in uniform. Just as citizens with them, you know," said Lieutenant Matt Wild with Claremore Police.

This is the first year Claremore Police have teamed up with the Senior Citizens Center.
