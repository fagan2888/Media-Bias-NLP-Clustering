Al-Liby's attorney, Bernard Kleinman, could also not be immediately reached.\n\nKleinman told the Washington Post that al-Liby's health had declined rapidly in the past month, though he did not know the cause of death.\n\nAl-Liby's family said he had suffered from the liver disease hepatitis C, and his health had delayed previous court hearings.\n\nAl-Liby had been scheduled to face trial, along with accused Osama bin Laden associate Khalid al-Fawwaz, on Jan. 12. Both men had pleaded not guilty.\n\n(Reporting by Curtis Skinner in San Francisco; Editing by Gareth Jones)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Reuters Editorial", "Author": "Reuters Editorial", "DCSext.PageNumber": 1, "twitter": {"description": "A suspected al Qaeda figure alleged to have planned the 1998 bombings of the U.S. embassies in Tanzania and Kenya has died in New York just days ahead of his scheduled trial, NBC News reported on Friday.", "title": "U.S. embassy bombing suspect dies ahead of New York trial: NBC News", "image": "http://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20150103&t=2&i=1011556484&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=LYNXMPEB0201S", "creator": "@Reuters", "site": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "DCSext.rChannel": "Article -
