As of 5 p.m. Friday, nearly $1,000 had been raised.\n\nBlount said, \u201cI'm not in any way looking to profit more off of this than for the purpose (of having my family there). You all have been so supportive from day one of this journey and I absolutely believe that I have the best fans in the world!\n\n\u201cI completely understand if you can't help this way, but you can help even more by VOTING on September 15th!
