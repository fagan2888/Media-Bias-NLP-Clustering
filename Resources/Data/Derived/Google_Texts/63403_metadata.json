(WANE) \u2013 Candidates for Indiana\u2019s 3rd District held a forum in the Kendallville Public Library Saturday morning.\n\nCongressional candidates who participated in the event include Republicans Liz Brown, Pam Galloway, Jim Banks, and Kip Tom; and Democrat Todd Nighten-helser.\n\nFor the candidates it was an opportunity to talk to voters about issues important to them. As for third district constituents, it was their chance to see exactly where the candidates stand.\n\nMichele Kilogore was one of dozens of people showed up to hear from the candidates. The state of Indiana\u2019s economy was at the top of her mind.\n\n\u201cI would like to see our economy grow,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel that a lot of our manufacturing companies are moving out of the country and I\u2019m concerned that a lot of people are needing jobs.\u201d\n\nCandidates discussed how to move the economy forward and create job growth.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve worked with Governor Daniels in the Indiana economic development corporation bringing jobs back to the Hoosier state,\u201d said candidate Kip Tom. \u201cI\u2019ve got a lazer focus on how to build the economy and bring those better paying jobs for all the Hoosiers and the people in the 3rd district here.\u201d\n\nThey also discussed other hot-button issues like the Affordable Care Act, illegal immigration, and education.\n\nLiz Brown said if she is elected into office her number one priority would be getting rid of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cWe need to figure out how we can get people affordable healthcare,\u201d she said. \u201cThe government shouldn\u2019t be doing that. It should be a free market system.

I know what they face on a daily basis.I want to be apart of rebuilding the military.\u201d\n\nAfter listening to the candidates Michele Kilgore still is not certain who she would vote for.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure there\u2019s one of them I would vote for just yet,\u201d she said. \u201cI haven\u2019t made up my mind.\u201d\n\nVoters head to the polls May third for the Indiana Primary.", "article_metadata": {"description": "This was the first time candidates vying for Indiana's 3rd District House seat met with voters in a forum setting.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=488222080", "og": {"site_name": "WANE", "description": "This was the first time candidates vying for Indiana\u2019s 3rd District House seat met with voters in a forum setting.", "title": "Congressional candidates participate in Kendallville forum", "url": "http://wane.com/2016/03/19/3rd-district-congressional-candidates-participate-in-forum/", "image": {"width": 480, "identifier": "https://lintvwane.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/3rd-dist-forum.jpg", "height": 270}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "This was the first time candidates vying for Indiana\u2019s 3rd District House seat met with voters in a forum setting.", "title": "Congressional candidates participate in Kendallville forum", "image": {"src": "https://lintvwane.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/3rd-dist-forum.jpg?w=640"}, "creator": "@wane15", "site": "wane15", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Fort Wayne News, Weather and Sports", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.linmedia.newstouch.wane", "fb": {"pages": 54012016429}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://wane.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2fd549580f5e4635901cf55d62e47240?s=16", "application-name": "WANE", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wane15", "published_time": "2016-03-19T22:19:25+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-20T16:09:06+00:00"}, "msvalidate.01": "25404283363C09DE121A55A903F03873", "google-site-verification": "lNZPWZeGC4zNForuuJZt1-sG4pyZKEfDzOHjOenyArg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Congressional candidates who participated in the event include Republicans Liz Brown, Pam Galloway, Jim Banks, and Kip Tom; and Democrat Todd Nighten-helser.\n(WANE) \u2013 Candidates for Indiana\u2019s 3rd District held a forum in the Kendallville Public Library Saturday morning.\n\u201cI\u2019ve worked with Governor Daniels in the Indiana economic development corporation bringing jobs back to the Hoosier state,\u201d said candidate Kip Tom.\nFor the candidates it was an opportunity to talk to voters about issues important to them.\nAs for third district constituents, it was their chance to see exactly where the candidates stand."}
