A Greene County family is receiving aid from the American Red Cross after what fire officials say was an electrical malfunction in the laundry room.

Bull Head Fire Chief Daniel King says it was just before 7:50 Sunday morning when units from his department, Walstonburg, and Fort Run responded to 25 Lane Road. EMS also responded to the home which had smoke showing.

King says there were two people inside at the time who were able to get out of the house.

The fire was contained to the laundry room, but King says repairs to a panel box need to be made before the family of two adults and seven children can return.

The scene cleared at 10:32 a.m.
