Laura Ingraham filled in for Bill O’Reilly on “The O’Reilly Factor” on Thursday, giving her an even bigger pulpit than usual from which to spew generally uninformed opinions. In the Talking Points Memo portion of the show, she addressed President Obama’s statement on the unrest in Ferguson, Missouri, regarding the fatal shooting of Michael Brown at the hands of the police.

“Think about what the president said today,” she said. “While he did urge calm, he also intimated that the Missouri police are out of control. They are targeting largely minority crowds with unreasonable force and they are hiding things… He should stop micromanaging local police and stop playing the politics of division. There is supposed to be a difference between being the president of the United States and a liberal commentator on Salon.com.”
