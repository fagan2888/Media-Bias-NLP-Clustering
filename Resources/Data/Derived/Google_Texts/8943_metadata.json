So I\u2019m definitely going to do it until December 31st,\u201d said Marshall, a Republican. \u201cMy campaign consultants are wanting me to quit. I think I might give up obstetrics, but I\u2019m not ready to give up my entire practice yet.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, campaigning brought Marshall to Manhattan. On Friday, it will take him to Hutchinson. At each stop, the political novice talks with school superintendents, business owners or residents in his bid to unseat three-term incumbent Rep. Tim Huelskamp in next August\u2019s primary.\n\nWhen asked what he thinks of Huelskamp, a tea party Republican widely considered to be among the most conservative members of Congress, Marshall laughed before pausing to collect his thoughts.\n\n\u201cI hear a lot of Kansans feel like they\u2019re not being represented very well, that we have no voice right now representing the Big First on the House side of things. I tend to agree with that. We have no voice in Congress,\u201d Marshall said.\n\nIn December 2012, Huelskamp was removed from his seat on the House Agriculture Committee, leaving Kansas without a member on the committee for the first time in a century. The removal followed the outspoken congressman\u2019s disagreements with House leadership, namely Speaker of the House John Boehner, R-Ohio.\n\nAs for his other opponent, Clyde resident and student retention specialist Alan LaPolice, Marshall said the two have spoken on a few occasions.\n\n\u201cI respect Alan. He\u2019s probably quite a bit more moderate on a lot of views than me. We have a cordial relationship and I respect his willingness to try to run again,\u201d Marshall said.\n\nOn the issue of immigration, Marshall\u2019s own views can be considered moderate. In addition to securing the border, which he hopes to accomplish through the use of private contractors, Marshall said he favors a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants currently in the United States.\n\n\u201cThere has to be a pathway to at least have a job. I\u2019m not ready to jump on the amnesty bandwagon just yet, but we need to find a way to get these people into the system,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cIf you\u2019ve had a job and you had a negative drug screen and you don\u2019t have a felony record, let\u2019s get a way to integrate them into our communities. We need them. We absolutely need these people.\u201d\n\nMarshall said the problem rests in bureaucratic inefficiencies that have made it difficult and unattractive for undocumented immigrants to obtain the proper paperwork. Soon after moving to Great Bend, Marshall said he and his wife met a hard-working woman who was able to become a legal citizen through the hard work of a local pastor.\n\n\u201cShe got her papers, her husband got his papers. Her children came, got their papers, I delivered them. I coached the grandson in football and baseball. The granddaughter became the homecoming queen,\u201d Marshall said.\n\n\u201cWe make it so hard for good people to become citizens,\u201d he added.\n\nMarshall said education spending is the issue he hears about most as he travels the 1st District, though government regulations and national security are also on the minds of many. While he is opposed to the Iranian nuclear deal, believing the Iranian regime can\u2019t be trusted, Marshall concedes that he doesn\u2019t have all the answers on foreign policy. Instead, he said, he relies on those he considers more informed than himself.\n\n\u201cFor foreign policy issues, I don\u2019t talk one-on-one with Senator Roberts but when I\u2019ve listened to Senator Roberts, he\u2019s forgotten more about foreign policy and military issues than I\u2019ll ever know,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cCongressman Pompeo seems to understand more military issues a lot better than the average congressman, as well. So I read their websites a lot and see what they\u2019re saying.\u201d\n\nOn the issue of health care, Marshall stopped short of calling for repeal of the Affordable Care Act but said it is causing deductibles to increase. Marshall believes the federal government should instead give block grants to states and allow the states to decide how to implement health care reforms.\n\n\u201cI think we have to somehow allow the Kansas Legislature to figure out how to take these block grants of money and use them for health care,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cThe doctors I talk to and the hospitals criticize me because of that, because they don\u2019t have a lot of faith in (legislators).\u201d\n\nMarshall concedes that the health care reform is complex and complicated. Despite being well versed through his own experiences, he continues to listen and learn on the issue of health care, he said. On immigration, however, the candidate is confident he\u2019s finding solutions.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019m figuring this one out,\u201d Marshall said.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "News, Local, Justin Wingerter", "og": {"site_name": "CJOnline.com", "description": "MANHATTAN - On Wednesday afternoon, campaign finance disclosures showed Roger Marshall raised nearly $200,000 last quarter, proving he is a viable candidate for U.S. Congress. \r\nOn Wednesday night, Marshall delivered a baby.", "title": "Congressional challenger Roger Marshall supports paths for immigrants, block grants to replace ACA", "url": "http://cjonline.com/news/2015-07-16/congressional-challenger-roger-marshall-supports-paths-immigrants-block-grants", "image": "http://cjonline.com/sites/default/files/photos/14425123.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "MANHATTAN \u2014 On Wednesday afternoon, campaign finance disclosures showed Roger Marshall raised nearly $200,000 last quarter, proving he is a viable candidate for U.S. Congress.On Wednesday night, Marshall delivered a baby.The obstetrician from Great Bend said in an interview Thursday that he isn\u2019t quite ready to give up his medical practice, despite campaigning against an incumbent and second challenger across a 63-county congressional district."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe3f61\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI think we have to somehow allow the Kansas Legislature to figure out how to take these block grants of money and use them for health care,\u201d Marshall said.\nMarshall believes the federal government should instead give block grants to states and allow the states to decide how to implement health care reforms.\nDespite being well versed through his own experiences, he continues to listen and learn on the issue of health care, he said.\n\u201cI think I\u2019m figuring this one out,\u201d Marshall said.\nI think I might give up obstetrics, but I\u2019m not ready to give up my entire practice yet.\u201dOn Thursday, campaigning brought Marshall to Manhattan."}
