Dallas Fire-Rescue crews are responding to a fire in the 4900 block of Gaston Ave. in Old East Dallas.

Firefighters received a call about the fire at a two-story house at 5:40 p.m. near N. Fitzhugh Ave and N. Munger Boulevard. One adult man was pulled from the house and taken to the hospital for minor smoke inhalation, said spokesman Jason Evans. His condition is unknown. There are no other injuries.

There was a lot of fire coming from the roof at the back of the house, but the wind pushed the fire toward the front of the house. Evans said at least 8 people were staying in the house and all were accounted for. The American Red Cross was called out to help those displaced.

Between 70-80 firefighters responded to the fire.

Residents were evacuated from the apartments on one side of the house. There is a vacant lot on the other side.

Darrin Clark, who lives across the street from the house, said he heard two men screaming “call the fire department.” By the time he got outside, Clark said the house was engulfed in flames as high as 15 feet.

At 7:30 p.m., the blaze appeared to have died down, but firefighters were still working on the remnants of the fire.
