The journalist also made some of the same comments on Fox News on Monday evening.\n\n\u201cAdvocates for a strong executive branch, including me, have given the White House a pass on its rule-making authority, because implementing such a complicated law requires flexibility,\u201d Fournier wrote. \u201cBut the law may be getting stretched to the point of breaking. Think of the [Affordable Care Act] as a game of Jenga: Adjust one piece and the rest are affected; adjust too many and it falls.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf not illegal,\u201d he continued, \u201cthe changes are fueling suspicion among Obama-loathing conservatives, and confusion among the rest of us. Even the law\u2019s most fervent supporters are frustrated,\u201d latter adding that he falls in the \u201cfrustrated category.\u201d\n\nFournier says he still supports the law because he \u201cwant[s] health insurance provided to the millions without it, for both the moral and economic benefits.\u201d But then he wrote something profound. He explained that he also wants Obamacare to work \u201cbecause, as Charles Lane wrote for The Washington Post, the link between work and insurance needs to be broken.\u201d\n\nThat last point is really one that hasn\u2019t been mentioned enough in the continuing debate over Obamacare, at least not until last week when the Congressional Budget Office explained that 2.5 million Americans will be disincentivized from working because of subsidies provided under the law.\n\nFournier is right on the mark in that the \u201clink between work and insurance needs to be broken.\u201d This is a policy goal for which most conservative and libertarian healthcare wonks have advocated.\n\nMost Americans are used to receiving health insurance benefits through their employer, a practice currently encouraged by the government through generous tax deductions. But this practice means workers will change health plans multiple times. That\u2019s a real problem, according to Rep. Tom Price (R-GA).\n\n\u201cWe ought not have a system where if you change your job or you lose your job, you lose your health coverage,\u201d Price told United Liberty last month. \u201cRight now, between 60% and 65% of the American people get their health coverage through their employer. If they changed their job or they lose their job, they ought not have to get a different kind of health coverage when they move to the next job that they have.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe way that we solve that is very simple, we make it so everybody owns their own coverage regardless of who\u2019s paying for it \u2014 so it\u2019s like a pension plan, it\u2019s like a 401(k) plan. If you change your job or you lose your job, you simply take your health coverage with you and plug it in there,\u201d he added.\n\nRather than providing generous tax credits to employers, why not reform the system in a way that empowers individuals to purchase their own health insurance coverage, something that allows them to keep a plan regardless of whether they change jobs.\n\nBy extending these tax credits to individuals through some sort of a voucher system or a tax deduction, we could actually accomplish what Obamacare purports to do without the effect of creating an incentive for people not to work.\n\nBut Obamacare isn\u2019t about breaking the link between employment and health coverage. It is, however, another redistributive scheme, which is why the White House and supporters of the law have been hailing the CBO report rather than acknowledging how absolutely devastating it is.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "CBO,delay,employees,employer mandate,employer-based health insurance,employers,Health Insurance,health plans,implementation,job,labor force,National Journal,Obama administration,ObamaCare,Ron Fournier,Tom", "DC.Title": "It's time to separate health coverage from employment", "robots": "index,follow", "copyright": "(c) 2005-2013 United Liberty", "description": "The Obama administration&#8217;s latest employer mandate delay is causing some to question their support of the law, or at the very least, express frustration with the way in which President Obama&#8217;s signature domestic achievement has been"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd6e95\"", "article_summary": "But Obamacare isn\u2019t about breaking the link between employment and health coverage.\n\u201cRight now, between 60% and 65% of the American people get their health coverage through their employer.\nIf you change your job or you lose your job, you simply take your health coverage with you and plug it in there,\u201d he added.\n\u201cWe ought not have a system where if you change your job or you lose your job, you lose your health coverage,\u201d Price told United Liberty last month.\nBut this practice means workers will change health plans multiple times."}
