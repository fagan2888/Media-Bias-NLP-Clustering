Now, the number of people who realize that Trump could actually win the Republican nomination has caused a mass anxiety attack. Recent editorial board meetings with both The Washington Post and The New York Times, where the former reality TV star laid out a world view based on a strategy of \u201cunpredictability,\u201d like withdrawing the U.S. from NATO, halting the purchase of oil from Saudi Arabia and allowing Japan and South Korea to have nuclear weapons, raised more eyebrows.\n\nIt raised alarms across the civilized world.\n\nRelated: Ex-Trump Insider: Donald Doesn\u2019t Want to Be President\n\nBesides Cameron, Here\u2019s what people are saying about Trump\u2019s foreign policy positions:\n\n\u201cVirtually every foreign leader that [ Secretary of State John Kerry ] meets with expresses concerns about the campaign rhetoric here in the United States, and expresses a fair bit of angst about where things are going,\u201d State Department spokesman John Kirby said Monday. \u201cThe very stark rhetoric that continues to emerge from the campaign is not being ignored by foreign leaders and foreign governments and foreign populations,\u201d he added.\n\n] meets with expresses concerns about the campaign rhetoric here in the United States, and expresses a fair bit of angst about where things are going,\u201d State Department spokesman John Kirby said Monday. \u201cThe very stark rhetoric that continues to emerge from the campaign is not being ignored by foreign leaders and foreign governments and foreign populations,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s not so much wrong or overly certain. It\u2019s incoherent,\u201d former CIA chief Michael Hayden, who served in the George W. Bush administration, told Politico. \u201cI view his [Trump\u2019s] current statements as erratic\u2026 I just don\u2019t know what it is he\u2019s going to do,\u201d Hayden added.\n\n\u201cHe cannot stick to a subject, it is remarkable. And when he doesn\u2019t know something, he just changes the subject, makes it all about himself,\u201d Andrea Mitchell, NBC News Chief Foreign Affairs Correspondent and anchor, said Sunday on Meet the Press. Trump \u201cwould cancel defense treaties with Japan and South Korea against North Korea. \u2026 He would be okay if Japan and South Korea go nuclear. American policy for decades since World War II has been trying to keep nukes out of that arena. He would stop importing oil from Saudi Arabia if they don't pay more for their defense. We need oil. We are not energy-independent. We rely on oil still for our daily needs.\n\n\u201cHe is completely all over the lot on Iran. \u2026 He complained that Iran isn't buying our planes. It had to be pointed out to him that Iran is still under sanctions and cannot buy American planes. He thinks North Korea and Iran are the biggest trading partners when North Korea's biggest trading partner is China. He is completely uneducated about any part of the world,\u201d she said.\n\nRelated: Why a Trump Candidacy Threatens the GOP Majority in Congress\n\n\u201cHe raised some serious questions about the U.S. and NATO. I share some of those questions,\u201d Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR), a member of the Armed Services Committee, told MSNBC on Friday. \u201cWe used to split our costs 50-50 between the U.S. and Europe. Today it\u2019s 70-30 between the U.S. and Europe. I would have a different approach.\n\n\u201cRather than reducing our spending on what is a critical national security alliance, I would urge European leaders to increase their spending specifically so we can stop the kind of terrorist attacks we\u2019ve seen in Paris and Brussels.\u201d\n\n\u201cScary. That\u2019s how we view Trump,\u201d one foreign ambassador told The Washington Post last week. \u201cCould we depend on the United States? We don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t tell you how the unpredictability we are seeing scares us.\u201d\n\ntold last week. \u201cCould we depend on the United States? We don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t tell you how the unpredictability we are seeing scares us.\u201d \u201cIn the past when candidates said extreme things, there always has been some seasoned, experienced adviser you could talk to, or who would speak out to soften what was said. This is not the case with Trump,\u201d said an ambassador from South America.\n\nRelated: For Now, Democrats Savor a Clinton-Trump Matchup this Fall", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The number of foreign policy experts worried about Donald Trump\u2019s views is threatening to grow from a trickle into a flood.", "title": "10 Foreign Policy Experts Who Think Trump Could Destroy America", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/29/10-Foreign-Policy-Experts-Who-Think-Trump-Could-Destroy-America", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-election-trump-hedgefunds_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/29/10-Foreign-Policy-Experts-Who-Think-Trump-Could-Destroy-America", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-election-trump-hedgefunds_2.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The number of foreign policy experts worried about Donald Trump\u2019s views is threatening to grow from a trickle into a flood.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe very stark rhetoric that continues to emerge from the campaign is not being ignored by foreign leaders and foreign governments and foreign populations,\u201d he added.]\n\u201cThe very stark rhetoric that continues to emerge from the campaign is not being ignored by foreign leaders and foreign governments and foreign populations,\u201d he added.\nThe number of foreign policy experts worried about Donald Trump\u2019s views is threatening to grow from a trickle into a flood.\nTrump \u201cwould cancel defense treaties with Japan and South Korea against North Korea.\n\u201cCould we depend on the United States?"}
