For a speech supposedly laying out the tenets of an entire political philosophy, there was very little intellectual content\u2014but a lot of vilifying of the captains of industry.\n\nWhole sections of the speech are devoted to decrying the excessive prosperity of the \u201cone percent\u201d and even worse, the \u201cone-tenth of one percent\u201d and blaming everything bad on \u201cWall Street, billionaires, and large corporations,\u201d who \u201cbuy elections.\u201d The \u201cbillionaire class,\u201d Bernie tells us, is a \u201cruling class whose greed is destroying our nation\u201d and who must be \u201cdefeated.\u201d\n\nAll of this vilification is necessary because the other big idea in the speech was promising us free stuff\u2014which we\u2019re supposedly going to pay for by raiding the money pits of all those billionaires.\n\nSpecifically, Bernie promised us more of the same kind of free stuff politicians have been promising us for a century\u2014and therein lies the curious contradiction of his case for socialism.\n\nBernie promises the same free stuff we\u2019ve been promised for a century, and there\u2019s the problem. Bernie wants to follow the example of Franklin Roosevelt: \u201cAgainst the ferocious opposition of the ruling class of his day, people he called economic royalists\u201d\u2014yep, those nasty billionaires again\u2014\u201dRoosevelt implemented a series of programs that put millions of people back to work, took them out of poverty and restored their faith in government.\u201d He then says he wants to extend and expand the welfare state created by FDR and LBJ. Except that something awkward happens along the way. Bernie makes a pretty convincing case against the very programs he hails as great successes for \u201cdemocratic socialism.\u201d\n\nHe opens the speech by hailing FDR\u2019s creation of Social Security, but then complains: \u201cToday, in America, the wealthiest country in the history of the world, more than half of older workers have no retirement savings\u2014zero\u2014while millions of elderly and people with disabilities are trying to survive on $12,000 or $13,000 a year. From Vermont to California, older workers are scared to death. \u2018How will I retire with dignity?\u2019 they ask.\u201d\n\nHe praises LBJ\u2019s War on Poverty, but then complains: \u201cToday, in America, nearly 47 million Americans are living in poverty and over 20 percent of our children, including 36 percent of African-American children, are living in poverty\u2014the highest rate of childhood poverty of nearly any major country on earth.\u201d\n\nWe just passed ObamaCare a few years ago, yet Bernie complains: \u201cToday, in America, 29 million Americans have no health insurance and even more are underinsured with outrageously high co-payments and deductibles. Further, with the United States paying the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs, 1 out of 5 patients cannot afford to fill the prescriptions their doctors write.\u201d\n\nHe hails the welfare state as the foundation of the middle class, then says the middle class is in decline. The contradiction is summed up in the way he hails the welfare state as \u201cthe foundation of the middle class,\u201d yet concludes that, \u201cThe reality is that for the last 40 years the great middle class of this country has been in decline.\u201d So from 1935 to 1965, Bernie\u2019s democratic socialist heroes established the modern welfare state. And then within a decade, the middle class went into a long-term decline.\n\nThat\u2019s funny. It\u2019s almost as if all of these \u201cdemocratic socialist\u201d programs deliver the opposite of what they promise.\n\nBut Bernie wants to plow forward on the theory that the only reason the welfare state hasn\u2019t worked is that it hasn\u2019t gone far enough: \u201cThat is why I believe in a Medicare-for-all single payer health care system. Yes. The Affordable Care Act, which I helped write and voted for, is a step forward for this country. But we must build on it and go further.\u201d\n\nThe real point of socialism is not prosperity for the masses, but resentment of the rich. Bernie is basically admitting that the welfare state has failed, so why try more of it? And if you keep trying and it doesn\u2019t actually produce results, at some point we\u2019re entitled to suspect that lifting up the middle class isn\u2019t your real goal. Perhaps that explains why hating billionaires is so central to Bernie\u2019s \u201cdemocratic socialist\u201d agenda. It seems like that\u2019s the real point after all\u2014not prosperity for the masses, but envy and resentment of the rich.\n\nIf Sanders paused to notice that his whole argument is based on the failure of the welfare state to deliver on its promises, he might have stopped to ask why the current level of welfare-state spending isn\u2019t producing \u201ceconomic security.\u201d And if he did that, he might have had to acknowledge that all of the free stuff promised to us by government isn\u2019t really free. It has to be paid for by taxpayers, which means that it has to be paid for by taxing the very same middle class people it is supposed to benefit.\n\nTake Social Security. Perhaps part of the reason so many older workers have nothing saved for retirement is that they\u2019ve spent so many decades forking over about 13% of their income in Social Security payroll taxes. Originally, Social Security was going to be paid for by a mere 2% payroll tax, but it has followed the iron law in which any welfare program, once introduced, will become progressively more expensive and ends up being paid for by fleecing the middle class.\n\nOr Bernie might have noticed that, while he keeps scolding us that no other \u201cmajor country\u201d\u2014a curiously condescending phrase\u2014fails to offer this or that welfare-state benefit, those other nations typically pay for it by imposing massive tax burdens. European welfare states are financed not just with high and progressive income taxes, but with massive payroll taxes and value added taxes, a kind of hidden levy that taxes the public by jacking up the price they pay for everything.\n\nThe taxes actually required to pay for the welfare state are mostly regressive. For all of Bernie\u2019s anti-billionaire rhetoric, the taxes actually required to pay for the welfare state are mostly regressive. Payroll taxes start taking money out of the very first dollar of earnings, and value added taxes are taxes on consumption, which hit the poor and middle class harder. Or consider the keystone of Bernie Sanders agenda, free college. As Diana Furchtgott-Roth points out, subsidies for higher education are the ultimate regressive tax. Everybody pays for them, but only middle-class college graduates reap the benefits in higher lifetime earnings.\n\nSanders declares, \u201cI believe that most Americans can pay lower taxes\u2014if hedge fund managers who make billions manipulating the marketplace finally pay the taxes they should.\u201d But he has inadvertently picked the right word: \u201cbelief.\u201d It\u2019s the sort of thing you can only maintain as an article of faith, because the evidence just doesn\u2019t support it.\n\nA hungry man is not free? No, a taxed and regulated man is not free. Then there is the price socialist economies pay in stifled long-term economic growth, as high taxes drain capital from the private economy and regulations make the market slow-moving and inflexible. In the only really ideological passage of the speech, Sanders quotes a line from FDR\u2019s 1944 State of the Union speech: \u201cWe have come to a clear realization of the fact that true individual freedom cannot exist without economic security and independence. Necessitous men are not free men.\u201d He says this to keep us from realizing that <i>taxed and regulated men aren\u2019t free</i>. Bernie sums up Roosevelt\u2019s point as \u201creal freedom must include economic security.\u201d What we\u2019ve actually discovered, through trial and a whole lot of error, is that FDR got it exactly backwards: real prosperity depends on economic freedom.\n\nThose are the lessons we can learn if, unlike Bernie, we stop clinging to faith in the welfare state and seek out the real lessons of his odd case against socialism.", "article_metadata": {"item-publish-date": "Tue, 01 Dec 2015 07:50:15 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "The Federalist", "description": "Bernie Sanders makes a convincing case against the very programs he hails as great successes for \"democratic socialism.\"", "title": "Bernie Sanders's Odd Case Against Socialism", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/19619885364_269e15fcaa_b.jpg", "url": "http://thefederalist.com/2015/12/01/bernie-sanderss-odd-case-against-socialism/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Federalist", "description": "Bernie Sanders makes a convincing case against the very programs he hails as great successes for \"democratic socialism.\"", "title": "Bernie Sanders's Odd Case Against Socialism", "image": {"src": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/19619885364_269e15fcaa_b.jpg"}, "creator": "@Tracinski", "site": "@FDRLST", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article": {"section": "Economics", "tag": "2016,Bernie Sanders,democratic socialism,Franklin Delano Roosevelt,Lyndon Johnson,Middle Class,payroll taxes,regulations,socialism,taxes,value added taxes,welfare state", "published_time": "2015-12-01T07:50:15+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Bernie Sanders makes a convincing case against the very programs he hails as great successes for \"democratic socialism.\""}, "article_summary": "Those are the lessons we can learn if, unlike Bernie, we stop clinging to faith in the welfare state and seek out the real lessons of his odd case against socialism.\nSo Bernie Sanders finally gave his long-promised speech explaining what \u201cdemocratic socialism\u201d means and making the case for it.\nBernie is basically admitting that the welfare state has failed, so why try more of it?\nAnd then within a decade, the middle class went into a long-term decline.\nSpecifically, Bernie promised us more of the same kind of free stuff politicians have been promising us for a century\u2014and therein lies the curious contradiction of his case for socialism."}
