Fed rate increases are expected to boost the dollar by driving investment flows into the United States.\n\nThe dollar slipped against the safe-haven yen for the first time in four days as a surge in risk appetite stalled. U.S. stocks, which flirted with record high levels on Wednesday, fell on Thursday, while oil prices also dropped.\n\nThe dollar was last down 0.35 percent against the Japanese currency at 109.44 yen, easing from a more than two-week high of 109.89 yen hit earlier in the session.\n\n\"We\u2019re a bit skeptical of this risk rally continuing to perform well,\" said Andres Jaime Martinez, FX and rates strategist at Barclays in New York.\n\nThe dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six other major currencies, was last up 0.11 percent at 94.592. The dollar was last up 0.23 percent against the Swiss franc at 0.9740 franc, near a more than three-week high of 0.9751 franc.\n\n(Reporting by Sam Forgione; Editing by James Dalgleish and Paul Simao)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - The euro reversed course to trade lower against the dollar on Thu", "title": "Dollar gains against euro after Draghi remarks, slips vs yen", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/20/Euro-wobbles-ECB-looms-gives-dollar-break", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/hungary_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/20/Euro-wobbles-ECB-looms-gives-dollar-break", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/hungary_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - The euro reversed course to trade lower against the dollar on Thu", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "The dollar slipped against the safe-haven yen for the first time in four days as a surge in risk appetite stalled.\nSome analysts also said markets were looking ahead to the Federal Reserve's policy meeting next week, anticipating strength in the dollar if the central bank issued a hawkish statement.\nThe dollar was last down 0.35 percent against the Japanese currency at 109.44 yen, easing from a more than two-week high of 109.89 yen hit earlier in the session.\nThe dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six other major currencies, was last up 0.11 percent at 94.592.\nThe dollar was last up 0.23 percent against the Swiss franc at 0.9740 franc, near a more than three-week high of 0.9751 franc."}
