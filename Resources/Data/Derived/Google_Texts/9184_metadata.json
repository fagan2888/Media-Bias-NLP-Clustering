Looming over that statistic is the fact that Mississippi is also home to one of the most obese populations in the country, with 34.6 percent of its citizens categorized as obese. Louisiana tops the list at 34.7 percent, but thirteen states all have obesity rates over 30 percent.\n\nAlthough obesity has a clear impact on human health \u2013 it can lead not just to diabetes, but also to cancer, high blood pressure, stroke, and other ailments \u2013 deShazo is also concerned by its potential effect on the economy. If younger people continue to be diagnosed with diabetes and ultimately end up with disabilities, the number of healthy, working individuals could shrink and put a squeeze on Mississippi\u2019s finances.\n\n\u201cWe're seeing 30- and 40-year-old people getting type 2 diabetes that we used to see in 50- and 60-year-old people,\u201d deShazo added to the Guardian. \u201cSo now that disability curve is shifting further and further to the left, to a younger and younger under- or unemployable population.\u201d\n\nGround zero for preventing this kind of future has been efforts to lower child obesity rates, but those attempts have hit their own share of obstacles. There\u2019s been a notable dip in child obesity for the state\u2019s affluent white population, but not for African Americans or the poor.\n\nTo make matters even more difficult, Mississippi does not have the healthcare resources necessary to deal with such a situation. Nearly 20 percent of the population does not have health insurance, and the state declined the Medicare expansion offered under the Affordable Care Act, which would have covered between 200,000 and 400,000 individuals.\n\nAs RT reported last year, obesity rates across the United States have continued to climb. In 2012, nearly 29 percent of the country\u2019s population was labeled obese, marking the 15th straight year an increase has been noted. The American Medical Association has classified obesity as a disease, hoping that putting the health concern in a different context will inspire more action to combat the epidemic.\n\nObesity isn\u2019t just an American problem, though. Earlier this month, a new study revealed that obesity rates in developing countries have tripled since 1980, affecting more than 900 million people around the world. The same report estimated that of the globe\u2019s entire population, 1.45 billion are obese or overweight.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As Mississippi continues to struggle in the fight against obesity, a leading state physician estimates that one third of the local population could have diabetes by 2030.", "og": {"site_name": "RT International", "description": "As Mississippi continues to struggle in the fight against obesity, a leading state physician estimates that one third of the local population could have diabetes by 2030.", "title": "Third of Mississippians to have diabetes by 2030, doctors claim", "locale": "en_EN", "image": "https://img.rt.com/files/news/21/d6/50/00/third-mississippians-have-diabetes.si.jpg", "url": "https://www.rt.com/usa/third-mississippians-have-diabetes-597/", "type": "article"}, "navigation": "tabbed", "twitter": {"description": "As Mississippi continues to struggle in the fight against obesity, a leading state physician estimates that one third of the local population could have diabetes by 2030.", "title": "RT International", "image": "https://img.rt.com/files/news/21/d6/50/00/third-mississippians-have-diabetes.si.jpg", "creator": "@RT_com", "site": "@RT_com", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "HandheldFriendly": "true", "format-detection": "telephone=yes", "msvalidate.01": "36879475773792950F4872586A371571", "google-site-verification": "VQLbsaWKiXW2-Vt4lP7MevnhMES537NO4fQjfGgLcbI", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "MobileOptimzied": "width", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe08d7\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe're going to have about a third of our population with diabetes by 2030,\u201d deShazo told the Guardian.\nEarlier this month, a new study revealed that obesity rates in developing countries have tripled since 1980, affecting more than 900 million people around the world.\nAs RT reported last year, obesity rates across the United States have continued to climb.\nLouisiana tops the list at 34.7 percent, but thirteen states all have obesity rates over 30 percent.\nAs Mississippi continues to struggle in the fight against obesity, a leading state physician estimates that one third of the local population could have diabetes by 2030."}
