The Fifth Annual “Rock Your Mocs” celebration has come and gone and indigenous pride was well-represented across social media – and from around the world including Italy, Ireland, and Antarctica.

Emergence Productions assisted RYM Founder Jessica “Jaylyn” Atsye, a member of the Laguna Pueblo in New Mexico, with initiatives offline and on related to running the annual celebration.

Here are just a few of the selections from the Rock Your Mocs Instagram and Facebook event pages.

“Today I wear my moccasins at one of the oldest educational institutions in the world in celebration of #RockYourMocs,” said @grandmasaidnotoo . “Being abroad, I have become very aware of my existence as a Native American / Indigenous person on an international level and it is alarmingly isolating. Coming from a predominantly Navajo (Diné) community and growing up on the Navajo Nation, I am used to being surrounded by individuals who look like me and understand where I am coming from. Oftentimes, I forget how much my ancestors have willingly sacrifice for my survival, my resistance, and my existence. I forget how very narrow the choices they had in life, and the choices they made were not for themselves. The choices they made were for me, and the generations after me.

“I rocked my mocs at work today #RunFlagstaff!” said Erin O’Keefe on the Rock Your Mocs 2015 Facebook Event Page. “Honoring my ancestors who ran in their moccasins! As Indigenous peoples, we have running in our blood. It's a form of prayer and moving meditation. So, no matter how fast or slow - just #RUN ! Keep the mind, body, and spirit strong for those who lived before us and those who will exist after us."

Rock Your Mocs is now a much-loved Native American Heritage Month tradition throughout Turtle Island. Here are some of our favorite photos from Facebook and Twitter using the #RockYourMocs hashtag.
