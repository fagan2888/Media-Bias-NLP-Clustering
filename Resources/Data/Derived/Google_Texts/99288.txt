Bill Maher’s made some ridiculously outrageous claims about Republicans over the years, but his latest blows them all out of the water. The HBO talk show host asserted on his show Friday night that the Tea Party – which celebrated its fifth anniversary this week – started not because of economic concerns but rather the color of President Barack Obama’s skin.

“It was about a black president,” Maher said about the Tea Party’s origins.

“That’s bulls***,” The Weekly Standard Editor Bill Kristol retorted back at him. “That is total bulls***. You think tens of millions of people just out there — even you don’t believe that,” he added. “You’re just saying that.”

“I totally believe that,” Maher insisted.

Earlier in the segment, Maher attempted to defend socialism by claiming that many of the companies that had been bailed out by the federal government in 2008 and 2009 had since paid back their debts to the treasury in full (or close to it). Kristol then explained to the liberal talk show host that the Tea Party had formed in response to President Obama’s plans for healthcare reform (later known as the Affordable Care Act) and the passage of the $830 billion stimulus plan and the Trouble Asset Relief Program (TARP).

“They were right to be worried about them, I think they were very bad precedent,” Kristol said of the stimulus plan and TARP.

Conservative CNN commentator Margaret Hoover later chimed in, arguing that the Tea Party started out as “a truly fiscal disciplinary mass movement” calling out politicians on both sides of the spectrum but later grew out-of-control after the 2010 Midterm elections, as conservative firebrands like Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann and grassroots organizations took over the movement.
