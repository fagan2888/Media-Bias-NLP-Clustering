Then, questions emerge.\n\nHow serious? Is it treatable? What can I do? How long do I have?\n\nPatients shouldn\u2019t have to ask, \u201cHow much will this cost?\u201d\n\nBut the cost of cancer is an aspect of growing importance in the conversation between healthcare providers and patients as drug prices continue to rise across the world.\n\nLast week, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved a treatment for melanoma, a deadly skin cancer, which shrunk tumors in 60 percent of patients in a clinical trial.\n\nThe drug\u2019s manufacturer, Bristol-Myers Squibb, will charge $141,000 for the first 12 weeks of treatment and $256,000 for a year of treatment, according to the Wall Street Journal. Experts fear the cost of the drug could keep some patients from receiving what could be the best care available.\n\nAmericans are growing increasingly irritated with the rising costs of cancer drugs and treatments.\n\nA Kaiser Health Tracking poll found 76 percent of the public believe a top priority for the president and Congress should be making high-cost drugs for chronic conditions affordable.\n\nAnother Kaiser poll found 72 percent of Americans believe drug costs are unreasonable and 74 percent think Big Pharma cares more about profits than people.\n\nThe cost of cancer isn\u2019t just affecting patients and their families either. It\u2019s affecting society. Politicians offer new plans to increase votes, health institutions encourage doctors to ask patients for money and the workforce loses billions of dollars every year in lost production.\n\nAnd the cost of cancer keeps rising.\n\nCost of Cancer on the Rise\n\nEach year, cancer costs the world more money than any other disease, according to the American Institute of Cancer Research (AICR).\n\nCancer costs $895 billion annually. Comparatively, heart disease costs $753 billion. Nothing else comes close, with traffic accidents and diabetes each costing about $204 billion.\n\n\u201cThe price for one year of life increased to $139,100 in 2005 and $207,000 in 2013.\u201d\n\nThe biggest financial impact is in terms of loss of life and productivity, in which cancer accounts for 1.5 percent of global gross domestic product (GDP) losses. The AICR estimates Americans lost 83 million years of healthy life because of cancer deaths and disabilities in 2008.\n\nMore than half a million Americans die of cancer, the second-leading cause of death in the U.S., every year.\n\nTo breakdown the direct healthcare costs, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) estimated cancer cost Americans $88.7 billion in 2011. Of that cost:\n\n50% came from hospital outpatient or doctor office visits\n\n35% came from inpatient hospital stays\n\n11% came from prescription drugs\n\nAnd it\u2019s getting more expensive.\n\nA 2011 study in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute determined the cost of all cancer care in the U.S. totaled $124.5 billion in 2010. The researchers projected the total cost would rise to $157.7 billion by 2020. The projected cost increase by phase of treatment is displayed in the table below.\n\nCost of Cancer Care in Billions of 2010 Dollars Initial Continuing Last 2010 $40.46 $46.64 $37.45 2020 $48.31 $61.37 $48.07 Increase 19.4% 31.6% 28.3%\n\nThere doesn\u2019t seem to be a good reason for the increase in cost though.\n\nA 2015 National Bureau of Economic Research study found anticancer drug prices at launch increased by 10% ever year between 1995 and 2013, about an $8,500 annual increase. That\u2019s after an adjustment for inflation and survival benefits.\n\nWhen calculating the average cost for one extra year of life, the researchers determined patients and insurers paid $54,100 in 1995. The price for one year of life increased to $139,100 in 2005 and $207,000 in 2013.\n\nAnother study (2014) published in The Lancet found the costs of cancer are already unaffordable in many countries. In the U.S., even those with very good insurance coverage incur out-of-pocket costs or experience overexposure to harmful treatments.\n\nMany people have no idea what to expect financially when their doctor gives them or a loved one the heartbreaking diagnosis.\n\nTotal Cost of Cancer Treatment\n\nOn an individual level, a cancer diagnosis isn\u2019t limited to physical and emotional hardship. It can put someone in a hard spot financially too.\n\nPeople may have to choose between more successful expensive treatments and less effective, affordable treatments.\n\nEach person\u2019s cost to treat cancer is different. According to the American Cancer Society (ACS), factors to treat cancer include:\n\nThe type of treatment.\n\nThe length of treatment.\n\nThe location of the treatment.\n\nThe type of insurance coverage.\n\nFor people with health insurance, the concern might not be as great. But some insurance plans won\u2019t cover the most expensive, sometimes most-necessary treatments.\n\nSadly, many cancer patients have to spend time and energy working out financial issues before treatment even begins. Others face financial struggles during treatment, and almost everyone spends precious energy trying to manage their money while recovering from treatment.\n\nMajor healthcare costs to consider include:\n\nHospital and clinic visits.\n\nMedicine and prescription drugs.\n\nLab tests.\n\nTreatments.\n\nSurgeries.\n\nHome health services.\n\nCost of Surgery\n\nPhysically removing a tumor during surgery is one of the top ways to treat cancer. Doctors can use surgery to prevent, diagnose, remove, or debulk (remove as much as possible) cancer. They have a variety of methods to do so too, according to the MayoClinic. Surgery methods include:\n\nCryosurgery: freezing cancer cells to destroy them.\n\nElectrosurgery: killing cancer cells with high-frequency current.\n\nLaser surgery: killing cancer cells with beams of intense light.\n\nMohs surgery: removing cancer cells layer by layer.\n\nLaparoscopic surgery: minimally-invasive surgery using small incisions.\n\nRobotic surgery: use of 3-D imaging and computers to operate surgical tools.\n\nThe costs per surgery vary greatly, depending on the hospital, insurance coverage and type of procedure.\n\nA 2014 study examining the costs of surgery involving various types of cancer found average costs ranging from $14,161 to $56,587. The costs included admissions, readmissions, physician services and other costs (outpatient visits, hospice care, home health agencies or medical equipment).\n\nAverage Cost of Cancer Surgery Procedure Cost Colectomy (colon) $31,738 Cystectomy (bladder) $42,386 Pancreatectomy (pancreas) $56,587 Proctectomy (rectum) $33,759 Prostatectomy (prostate) $14,161 Pulmonary lobectomy $39,412\n\nCost of Chemotherapy\n\nChemotherapy is another way to treat cancer. It involves chemicals that kill fast-growing cells. Since cancer cells grow more quickly than other body cells, doctors often use chemotherapy to treat the disease.\n\nAccording to an Avalere Health study which analyzed three years of data, the adjusted (based on age, sex and prior cancer history) cost of chemotherapy differed depending on location \u2013 in a doctor\u2019s office or hospital\u2019s outpatient department (HOPD).\n\nAverage Cost of Chemotherapy Office HOPD 1 Month $10,764 $13,828 6 Months $49,062 $61,661 12 Months $66,826 $102,395\n\nThe costs also differed depending on the type of cancer. The most expensive was colon cancer, which cost $45,997 in an office and $46,220 in an HOPD. The average costs for all lengths of treatment (averaging 3.8 months in an office and 3.4 months in an HOPD) ranged from $28,177 in an office to $34,973 in an HOPD.\n\nCost of Radiation Therapy\n\nRadiation therapy is another form of expensive cancer treatment. It involves the use of intense energy beams, usually X-rays, to kill genetic material. The radiation kills both healthy cells and cancer cells, so the length of treatment is usually shorter than chemotherapy.\n\nThe Avalere Health study also analyzed the adjusted cost of radiation therapies at different locations.\n\nAverage Cost of Radiation Therapy Office HOPD 1 Month $11,472 $13,209 2 Months $23,305 $24,150 3 Months $38,732 $35,761\n\nThe costs of radiation therapy also differed by cancer type. The most expensive was prostate cancer, which cost $37,472 in an office and $29,800 in an HOPD. The average costs for all lengths of treatment (averaging 2.1 months in an office and 1.9 months in an HOPD) ranged from $25,144 in an office to $23,756 in an HOPD.\n\nMost people think of healthcare costs when they think of the cost of cancer, but there are other costs that many don\u2019t consider.\n\nHidden Costs During Cancer Treatment\n\nCancer affects people far more financially than they usually realize. The cost is not limited to hospital visits and clinical treatments. It often includes costs like traveling to specialized centers, lost income from having to miss work and new clothes or accessories.\n\nAccording to the ACS, hidden costs include:\n\nGas and parking expenses during visits to appointments.\n\nLodging during treatment on the road.\n\nMeals while away from home.\n\nChild care costs.\n\nCommunication costs, like copies of medical records.\n\nSpecial nutritional supplements.\n\nSpecial equipment or clothing.\n\nAdditionally, some families hire someone to assist them with the challenges they face. They may hire someone to make meals and clean around the house.\n\nFamilies often seek legal and financial guidance too. They may ask a lawyer to help them understand legal rights when dealing with employers or insurance companies, how to write a will or how to deal with medical professionals if something were to occur.\n\nFamilies may seek help preparing income taxes with their new medical expenses, planning estates or granting a power of attorney.\n\nCancer affects people far more financially than they usually realize.\n\nEffect on Families\n\nTreating cancer is often a team battle, and patients rely on the time and energy of friends and family to help them get through their challenging time.\n\nStudies that compare caregivers of cancer patients to the general population show caregivers suffer economic ramifications. Many miss work and report work impairment. Caregivers are also more likely to suffer depression, anxiety, insomnia and migraines, requiring them to seek their own health treatment.\n\nUnfortunately, families suffering from the loss of a loved one at the hands of cancer also have to deal with financial struggles at one of the most difficult times in their lives. Financial costs can include autopsies, funeral services, obituaries, death certificates, and settling estate and property claims.\n\nInsurance\u2019s Role in Cancer Costs\n\nHealth insurance is the biggest factor in the equation of personal healthcare costs for cancer patients. Insurance plans usually cover most major costs like doctor appointments, hospital stays, tests and procedures.\n\nHowever, very few plans cover all of the costs in full. Almost all plans require co-payments for each appointment or visit. Tests and procedures often require patients to pay some money out of pocket too.\n\nThe most effective drugs and procedures are usually the most expensive. That means access to the treatment that can most successfully treat cancer often requires insurance. People without insurance usually don\u2019t receive the best care available because they can\u2019t afford it.\n\nFortunately, the Affordable Care Act helped millions of Americans receive access to health insurance.\n\nAffordable Care Act\n\nPresident Barack Obama signed the ACA in March of 2010.\n\nThe ACA made drastic changes to many health insurance plans in terms of coverage and services offered. Some of the changes that affect cancer patients and their families include:\n\nHealth plans must cover people with a pre-existing condition, like cancer.\n\nCancer screening tests, such as mammograms and colonoscopies, must be available at little or no cost to patients.\n\nInsurance plans can\u2019t cancel coverage if patient gets sick.\n\nPlans can\u2019t charge ill people \u2013 including those with cancer \u2013 more than healthy people.\n\nPlans can\u2019t have annual and lifetime dollar limits for how much a provider will pay.\n\nPlans can\u2019t limit or drop coverage for a patient who chooses to participate in a clinical trial.\n\nYoung adults can stay on their parents\u2019 plan until age 26.\n\nEven with the growing number of people covered by the ACA, about 11 percent of Americans were without health insurance through the first half of 2015, according to Gallup polls.\n\nFor people without insurance, the costs to treat cancer can be astronomical. Many people don\u2019t realize health insurance providers aggressively negotiate costs of drugs and procedures.\n\nAn August study found uninsured cancer patients in North Carolina paid twice as much for doctor appointments and 43 times as much for chemotherapy as the amount people with insurance and their providers paid.\n\nPeople who don\u2019t have health insurance can ask doctors and hospitals for discounts. Patients can also ask for generics, although very few generic drugs are available for treating cancer.\n\nMinimizing Expenses\n\nThere are other ways cancer patients can attempt to minimize expenses. Many hospitals provide case managers or have social workers who work on site to help patients and their families deal with the emotional and financial hardships they face.\n\nDoctors and nurses can also provide referrals to a number of support services and financial resources available to cancer patients.\n\nLocal and national service organizations and government assistance programs may offer grants to help pay for some services or medications.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to learn what insurance will cover when participating in a clinical trial. Insurers can\u2019t drop coverage if a patient participates in a trial, but some plans do not cover \u201cexperimental\u201d or \u201cinvestigational\u201d treatments.\n\nSome plans only cover tests or doctor\u2019s visits that would have been part of a treatment plan if it weren\u2019t for clinical trial participation. They aren\u2019t usually required to pay for the experimental treatment.\n\nThat might not be worrisome for some trials though. The study sponsor may provide treatment and tests at no cost to participants. Sponsors may also cover travel time, mileage and hotel stays. Patients should always be aware of their possible expenses if they join a clinical trial, and how much that costs compared to standard treatment.\n\nMedical Debt from Cancer\n\nEven with health insurance and proper financial planning, many cancer survivors or families of patients suffer from medical debt.\n\nA study presented at the 2014 Palliative Care in Oncology Symposium found 27 percent of cancer survivors reported suffering a financial problem like debt or bankruptcy. Another 37 percent reported modifying work plans or delaying retirement.\n\nExperts say one of the biggest financial mistakes patients make is letting bills pile up. It\u2019s easy to do when faced with such a tragic diagnosis, but it often leads to even more problems in the future.\n\nIndividuals and families feel the financial burdens of cancer on personal levels, but it affects everyone on a larger scale.\n\nCancer\u2019s Cost on Society\n\nCancer affects society on both global and national levels.\n\nWhen pharmaceutical company CEO Martin Shkreli raised the price of a drug used in AIDS, malaria and cancer patients 5,000 percent the eyes of politicians lit up.\n\nPresidential candidate Hilary Clinton proposed a plan that would allow the U.S. government and Medicare to negotiate prescription drug costs. Candidate Donald Trump called Shkreli a spoiled brat who ought to be ashamed of himself. Other candidates also proposed alternative healthcare plans they promised to implement if elected.\n\nFacing enormous public pressure, Shkreli dropped the price of the drug.\n\nThe cost of cancer\u2019s effect on society isn\u2019t limited to political discussion. Work forces across the planet feel the impact.\n\nA 2014 study in the International Journal of Cancer estimated the cost of lost productivity from cancer deaths in Europe was 75 billion euros ($84 billion), with breast cancer costing the most of any cancer at 7 billion euros ($7.84 billion) in lost productivity.\n\nThe cost affects hospitals and other healthcare facilities too. Many institutions rely on private donors to help keep cancer treatment available and affordable.\n\nA recent study found almost half of doctors surveyed at 40 leading cancer centers were taught to identify patients who might be a good donor. One third of those surveyed had been asked to solicit a donation, but only half of that number agreed to do so.\n\nThe moment a doctor says the word cancer after a test or procedure, the lives of the patient and their families change. They\u2019ll have a thousand questions to ask. They\u2019ll wonder how much it will cost physically and emotionally.\n\nSadly, they\u2019ll also have to determine how much cancer will cost financially.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The cost of cancer treatments has increased dramatically.
