Health Reform: The Obama administration is touting the “fact” that nearly 12 million people either signed up or re-enrolled for ObamaCare this year. Why on Earth should anyone believe this?

First off, we already know that this ObamaCare number is inflated because it counts anyone who picked a plan during open enrollment, not those who actually paid their first premium.

A year ago, the White House bragged that 8 million had signed up, only to admit months later that the actual enrollment number was just 6.7 million.

Assuming the same rate of attrition this year, the real enrollment number will be more like 9.8 million, which is well below the Congressional Budget Office’s forecast of 13 million paid enrollees for this year.

What’s more, enrollment in California and New York — the two biggest markets that enthusiastically embraced ObamaCare — barely increased this year, suggesting a lack of enthusiasm for this “benefit.”

That’s not likely to improve next year, when ObamaCare premiums are expected to spike across the board as government bailout money dries up, and because insurers can’t wring much more savings out of narrow networks or deductibles.

Those higher premiums will also exacerbate what is already a problem for ObamaCare — not enough young people are signing up.

Because the law bans insurers from charging more based on health, and strictly limits pricing based on age, the exchanges must attract sufficient numbers of young people to avoid a premium “death spiral.”

But as Jed Graham notes on IBD’s Capital Hill blog, enrollment among the young is way below expectations.

“If participation among young adults had matched their share of the population,” Graham reports, “then 4.8 million young adults would have enrolled — but just 3.25 million selected plans.”

That, too, will put upward pressure on premiums.

In any other context, ObamaCare would be deemed a failure.
