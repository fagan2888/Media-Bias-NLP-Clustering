Governor Steve Beshear has announced new ways for Kentuckians to check out the state's health care exchange.

Beginning Thursday, those new options will be available online and you can visit a new store at a Lexington mall to help you get signed up.

This year's enrollment period begins Saturday and will run through Feb.15.

A Kynect store opened at Fayette Mall on Thursday and will be there until the enrollment period ends.

In addition to the new store, the state has also announced a new mobile app, improvements to their website and more representatives to help at the call centers.

Governor Beshear was at the mall Thursday for the opening of the store, which will be located in the old Aveda temporary store, near Soma.

More than 521,000 Kentuckians have enrolled for insurance coverage through Kynect.
