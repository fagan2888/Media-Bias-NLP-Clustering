Let\u2019s take a look.\n\nTop 5 Healthcare Compliance Concerns of Small Employers\n\nSmall employers don\u2019t have to deal with the Employer Shared Responsibility and extensive healthcare reporting that larger employers do, however there are a few compliance concerns employers of all sizes shouldn\u2019t ignore.\n\nFor small employers, defined as fewer than 50 FTE employees, the top compliance concerns are:\n\n1. Exchange Notice Management\n\nAll employers covered by FLSA are required to provide employees a notice about the availability of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s Health Insurance Exchanges (Marketplaces). There are template notices available and employers should verify they are meeting the Exchange (\u201cMarketplace\u201d) notice requirements, as well as other health plan notice requirements.\n\n2. Benefits Plan Structure\n\nAny employer offering health benefits must ensure the health plan meets new standards for plan structure. For example, the new \u201cMarket Reforms\u201d require all group health plans to cover preventive care without cost-sharing and not place an annual or lifetime limit on essential health benefits.\n\nAnd, depending on the type of benefits offered (ex: group health insurance policy or self-insured medical reimbursement plan), there are additional plan structure requirements to abide by (see this checklist).\n\n3. Eligibility and Enrollment Requirements\n\nAny employer offering health benefits must also ensure new eligibility and enrollment requirements are followed. For example, the ACA requires a maximum waiting day of 90 days and new health plan notices are required at enrollment, and throughout the year.\n\n4. Minimum Essential Coverage\n\nOn top of mind for many small business owners - especially self-employed and micro business owners, is the requirement for all individuals to have minimum essential coverage. In other words, they must have qualified health insurance coverage regardless if it is available through work. This means small business owners (and employees) are looking for compliant ways to have the business help employees with the cost of individual health insurance.\n\n5. Calculating Full Time Equivalent Employees\n\nThe last top ACA compliance concern for small and growing businesses is to not become an applicable large employer (ALE), where the Employer Shared Responsibility provision would come into play.\n\nEmployers on the cusp of 50 FTE employees are seeking to understand the ACA\u2019s definition of a full time employee and are evaluating hiring and staffing decisions with this in mind.\n\nRelated: ACA Compliance - Will You Be Penalized at Tax Time?\n\nConclusion\n\nThese top five ACA compliance concerns have many small business owners seeking ways to better understand and manage compliance. As such, employers are turning to their health insurance adviser or health benefits company for advice, while others are utilizing new ACA compliance technologies to understand and implement compliance, while reducing administrative time.\n\nIf you\u2019re a small business owner or a health insurance professional, what compliance concerns would you add to the list?
