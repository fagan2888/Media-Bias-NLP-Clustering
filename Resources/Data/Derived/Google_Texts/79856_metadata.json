Pearson told CNN on Friday that he could no longer be a mouthpiece for conservatism due to issues he saw with the GOP\u2019s viewpoints on racial and gender disparity and youth issues.\n\n\u201cI was tired of being a champion of a party that turned a blind eye to racial discrimination. Tired of being a champion of any cause that denies equal rights to every American. Tired of being a champion of a party that doesn\u2019t care about the issues important to young people,\u201d C.J.wrote in an email to CNN.\n\nThe black teen from Georgia said in an interview that he began reconsidering his party affiliation after having a conversation with another teen friend, who asked why he doesn\u2019t speak out on racial discrimination. C.J. replied he was concerned his followers wouldn\u2019t be pleased.\n\n\u201cOver the past few days, I thought about essentially how I don\u2019t want people to follow me because I\u2019m that anti-Obama kid, or who called out Hillary Clinton or who took Bernie Sanders to task,\u201d He said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be the conservative wonder kid that people follow because I make them feel good and like young people are part of their movement. I want to be followed because I\u2019m the voice of a generation that doesn\u2019t have a voice at the table.\u201d\n\nHe said the video of Laquan McDonald being shot 16 times by a police officer in Chicago opened his eyes to the issue of systematic racial discrimination in America and the need to look at those issues objectively.\n\n\u201cMy generation is one of the most politically diverse ever, and I\u2019ll continue to be a voice but one that looks at issues objectively,\u201d he said. \u201cMy views on the issues aren\u2019t going to be dictated by one political platform or another.\u201d\n\nC.J. supported Texas Sen. Ted Cruz\u2019s 2016 White House bid, but has now left his post as chairman of Teens for Ted and disconnected himself from the campaign at the beginning of the month.\n\nHe said Mr. Cruz was not doing enough to address issues affecting young people.\n\nMr. Cruz\u2019s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nC.J. rose to fame on social media with videos criticizing President Obama, Hillary Clinton, and radical liberals.\n\nWhen Mr. Obama invited Ahmed Mohamed \u2014 a 14-year-old who arrested for bringing a clock to school that resembled a bomb \u2014 to the White House, C.J. posted a video blasting the decision.\n\n\u201cWhen cops are gunned down, you don\u2019t invite them to the White House. You never did. But when a Muslim kid builds a clock, come on by. What is this world you\u2019re living in?\u201d he said in the video.\n\nIn September, C.J. claimed the White House had blocked him on Twitter after he criticized Mr. Obama. The White House denied the claim and questions were raised about the authenticity of the screenshot the teen had tweeted showing he had been block.\n\nC.J. later admitted that it was a hoax.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The 13-year-old who made waves online with his conservative videos criticizing President Obama and others is now saying he no longer affiliates himself with the Republican party.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The 13-year-old who made waves online with his conservative videos criticizing President Obama and others is now saying he no longer affiliates himself with the Republican party.", "title": "C.J.
