Mike Huckabee became the sixth GOP presidential candidate to officially enter the race Tuesday.\n\nHuckabee, who delivered remarks on the campus of the University of Arkansas Community College in his hometown of Hope, Ark., told a chanting crowd, \u201cI announce that I am a candidate for President of the United States of America.\u201d\n\nHe emphasized his commitment to taking America \u201cfrom hope to higher ground,\u201d touching on the economy, our nation\u2019s veterans, the \u201cmonster\u201d of Obamacare, ISIS and other issues deserving of focus.\n\nThe 59-year-old politician ran for the Republican nomination for president in 2008, and though he saw success in the Iowa caucuses, Huckabee was ultimately beat by Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.).\n\nAfter his campaign launch Tuesday, Huckabee will travel to Iowa to embark on his \u201cFactories, Farms and Freedom\u201d tour, from which he will travel to South Carolina to deliver remarks on economic opportunity Friday, according to USA TODAY.\n\nHuckabee served as governor of Arkansas between 1996 to 2007, years after former President Bill Clinton held the same title.\n\nWhile not at the head of the GOP pack, Huckabee has strong favorability ratings and is rather popular among conservative Millennials. A Harvard University Institute of Politics poll released last week has Huckabee tied with former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush for third place among Republicans ages 18 to 29 behind Dr. Ben Carson and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul.\n\nWatch the video that introduced Huckabee at the event Tuesday below.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Huckabee, who delivered remarks on the campus of the University of Arkansas Community College in his hometown of Hope, Ark., told a chanting crowd, \"I announce that I am a candidate for President of the United States of America.\"", "title": "Mike Huckabee announces presidential run, promises to take U.S...", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2015/05/mike-huckabee-announces-presiden-600x337.jpg", "height": 337}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2015/05/05/mike-huckabee-announces-presidential-run-promises-take-u-s-hope-higher-ground/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "mike-huckabee-run-president", "published_time": "2015-05-05T11:54:46+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-05T12:04:04+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9e45\"", "article_summary": "Mike Huckabee announces presidential run, promises to take U.S. \u2018from hope to higher ground\u2019Former Arkansas Gov.\nMike Huckabee became the sixth GOP presidential candidate to officially enter the race Tuesday.\nHuckabee served as governor of Arkansas between 1996 to 2007, years after former President Bill Clinton held the same title.\nWhile not at the head of the GOP pack, Huckabee has strong favorability ratings and is rather popular among conservative Millennials.\nA Harvard University Institute of Politics poll released last week has Huckabee tied with former Florida Gov."}
