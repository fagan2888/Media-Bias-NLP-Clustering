One of them is the gap between career opportunities for our young people and their ability to take advantage of them.\n\nConsider the following:\n\n\u2022 Although Colorado is poised for above-average growth in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) and other in-demand industries with good-paying jobs, currently fewer than 25 percent of high school graduates are able to attain the post-secondary training and credentials required for employment in these fields.\n\n\u2022 More than 16 percent of Colorado\u2019s STEM workforce is close to retirement, making it difficult for our state to keep up with employer demand. As those workers leave, so too could the Colorado jobs they fill.\n\n\u2022 In addition to our skills gap, Colorado has a serious diversity gap. Although females comprise nearly half of our workforce and Hispanics are the state\u2019s fastest-growing population, both constituencies are underrepresented in STEM fields.\n\nThat\u2019s why the General Assembly provided the bipartisan leadership to bring an innovative new education model to Colorado. The model, approved by the legislature and signed by Gov. John Hickenlooper, is called P-TECH (Pathways in Technology Early College High School), and it unites school districts, community colleges and employers to provide our young people with a clear pathway from high school and college to career. In an era of widespread disagreement over education reforms, P-TECH has garnered broad national support, from President Obama \u2014 who highlighted it in his 2013 State of the Union speech \u2014 to governors, mayors and the leaders of teachers\u2019 and principals\u2019 unions.\n\nP-TECH began in New York in 2011 as a partnership of the New York City Public Schools, the City University of New York and IBM, which invented the P-TECH concept and has offered to partner in one of Colorado\u2019s first P-TECH schools. These schools offer students a clearly structured, integrated six-year program (grades nine to 14) from which graduates obtain both a college degree and the academic and workplace skills for success in the global economy.\n\nThis is achieved by embedding workplace skills into a strong academic curriculum, providing each student with a mentor, leading structured workplace visits, and offering paid internships and a clear promise to be first in line for good-paying jobs upon graduation with IBM and the other companies involved.\n\nWith more than 14 million new middle-skill jobs being created over the next six years \u2014 jobs requiring postsecondary training, but not necessarily a four-year degree \u2014 P-TECH is just what Colorado needs.\n\nIn less than four years, the P-TECH network has grown from one school to 27. By this fall, 40 P-TECH schools will be open in Connecticut, Illinois and New York, with 100 employers involved. And by 2016, Rhode Island will join Colorado in the P-TECH network, which also will expand outside of the U.S. to Australia.\n\nThe two main reasons for this rapid expansion are open access and proven results. No testing is required for admission to P-TECH schools, which operate within existing district budgets. P-TECH schools serve historically underserved communities, which for the first time are seeing their children excited about learning and transforming their potential. And P-TECH schools post record-breaking attendance rates.\n\nP-TECH schools don\u2019t just motivate. They also allow students to take and pass credit-granting college courses while they are still in high school. In fact, some students in the first P-TECH schools are completing their six-year program a full two years ahead of schedule. Every one of these dynamic, motivated and prepared young adults is heading off to either a high-paying job at IBM or to a prestigious four-year college on a full scholarship.\n\nWe live in a time of rapid and extraordinary change, much of it led by industries right here in Colorado. But up to now, too little of that change has been focused on improving the education and skills needed by our most vulnerable young people and addressing the need that our companies have for highly skilled workers. P-TECH schools will do just that, preparing the next generation of Coloradans for full participation in the economy while keeping good jobs here at home and attracting more of them.\n\nState Rep.
