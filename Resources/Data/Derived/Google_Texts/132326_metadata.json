He said he was concerned that Gallup came to such different conclusions but said his study used solid and more recent data \u2013 state enrollment reporting -- as opposed to Gallup's survey methods. \"I think administrative data is better,\" he said.\n\nChristina Milano, a family doctor at OHSU Richmond clinic, said her clinic has seen almost all their uninsured patients get covered. \"This makes a huge difference for these patients who previously had to pay out of pocket or work out other payment agreements,\" she said.\n\nThe study used a state insurance survey that found that in June 2013, 550,000 Oregonians were uninsured. Those findings were echoed by U.S. Census survey findings also released Thursday that found 570,000 Oregonians were uninsured in 2013.\n\nGraven and several researchers at the Oregon Health Authority added up enrollment data collected by the state from health insurers, combined with enrollment gains in the Oregon Health Plan \u2013 the state's version of Medicaid, which is overseen by OHA.\n\nAs of June 2014, Oregon Health Plan enrollment has jumped from 614,000 to 976,000, or more than 360,000 people since June 2013, the study found. Those gains more than offset a slight drop in private insurance, of about 10,000 people overall.\n\n\"Medicaid definitely drove it,\" Graven said of Oregon's gains.\n\nDriving the Medicaid increases were changes made by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which boosted the maximum income allowed from 100 percent of the federal poverty level to 138 percent, or $15,521 a year for a household of one. Also, gone is the asset test that prohibited people with significant property holdings or savings from signing up; instead only income is considered. Oregon was one of a few states that used a highly streamlined approval process for food-stamp recipients, contributing more than a third of the total increase.\n\nThe federal government will initially cover 100 percent of states' costs for new Medicaid enrollees made eligible by the boost in income levels. Federal support will ratchet down to 90 percent of costs in 2019.\n\nWithin private health insurance, enrollment in employer-purchased plans dropped by 47,000 people, while individual market coverage gained about 37,000 people.\n\nGraven suspected the individual market gains were driven by the mandate to have health coverage imposed by the federal health law, as well as the ease in comparison-shopping, tax credits and other subsidies offered by Cover Oregon. Not only that, but the law required coverage for people with pre-existing conditions who previously were denied by insurers.\n\nBefore the law, \"There was a big chunk of people who just couldn't get insurance,\" he said.\n\n--Nick Budnick", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "cover oregon,health reform", "title": "Oregon's uninsurance rate cut more than half following federal health reforms, researchers say", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Oregon\\u0027s uninsurance rate cut more than half following federal health reforms, researchers say\", \"link\": \"http://www.oregonlive.com/health/index.ssf/2014/09/oregons_uninsurance_rate_cut_m.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.oregonlive.com/home/olive-media/width620/img/health_impact/photo/11931203-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"13949112\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-09-18T20:22:08Z\", \"author\": \"Nick Budnick | The Oregonian/OregonLive\", \"tags\": [\"@breaking-news\",\"@business\",\"@business-newsletter\",\"@hp-top-stories\",\"@politics\",\"cover oregon\",\"health reform\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.oregonlive.com/health_impact/photo/11931203-thumb_square_large.jpg", "creator": "@NickBudnick", "site": "@Oregonian", "card": "summary", "description": "Oregon's uninsurance rate has dropped from about 14 percent to just 5 percent in the past year, a new study found."}, "article_date_updated": "Thursday, September 18, 2014,  4:14 PM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.oregonlive.com/health_impact/photo/oregonhealthreformsapjpg-e21d5f239463863e.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"nbudnick\", \"author_nickname\": \"Nick Budnick | The Oregonian/OregonLive\", \"author_id\": \"9643439\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Health & Fitness News\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.oregonlive.com/health/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "OregonLive.com", "description": "Oregon's uninsurance rate has dropped from about 14 percent to just 5 percent in the past year, a new study found.", "title": "Oregon's uninsurance rate cut more than half following federal health reforms, researchers say", "url": "http://www.oregonlive.com/health/index.ssf/2014/09/oregons_uninsurance_rate_cut_m.html", "image": "http://media.oregonlive.com/design/alpha/img/logo_olive.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "OregonLive.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Thursday, September 18, 2014,  1:20 PM", "article_author": "Nick Budnick | The Oregonian/OregonLive", "Description": "Oregon's uninsurance rate has dropped from about 14 percent to just 5 percent in the past year, a new study found."}, "article_summary": "The number of uninsured Oregonians has dropped 63 percent, from 550,000 to 202,000 people, since national health care reforms took effect, researchers say.\nWithin private health insurance, enrollment in employer-purchased plans dropped by 47,000 people, while individual market coverage gained about 37,000 people.\nAn estimated 95 percent of Oregonians now have health coverage, up from 86 percent last year, according to a study released Thursday by Oregon Health & Science University and the Oregon Health Authority.\nGraven and several researchers at the Oregon Health Authority added up enrollment data collected by the state from health insurers, combined with enrollment gains in the Oregon Health Plan \u2013 the state's version of Medicaid, which is overseen by OHA.\nThe study used a state insurance survey that found that in June 2013, 550,000 Oregonians were uninsured."}
