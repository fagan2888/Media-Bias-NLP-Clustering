Matthew Pouliot, R-Augusta, said he voted against the bill because the loan could apply to students studying out of state.\n\nThe bill does not include any financing, but the governor\u2019s office is separately proposing a $10 million bond to take to voters this fall that would launch the program, according to former Maine Education Commissioner Tom Desjardin, who spoke on behalf of the governor\u2019s office on the bill. Passing the bill would mean the language would be in place whenever funding is approved.\n\nDesjardin said the bond would be a way to jump-start the program.\n\n\u201cIf the program is wildly successful, we can find other sources of funding and it can expand to lots of other (non-STEM) areas,\u201d he told the committee.\n\nThe loans would have a tiered interest rate, and students who went on to work outside the STEM fields would pay 5 percent, and students who left the state would pay 8 percent.\n\nLawmakers on the committee added language to the bill to spell out that the loans would cover students who become teachers of STEM subjects.\n\nMaine\u2019s need for STEM workers is expected to rise sharply in the coming years, according to a 2015 report by the state Department of Labor. The number of science- and technology-related jobs is expected to increase by almost 7,000, or 6.5 percent, from 2012 to 2022.\n\nIn-state tuition and fees at the University of Maine in Orono total $10,600 a year, plus an additional $100 per engineering course.\n\nFAME is a quasi-independent state agency that distributes funds authorized by the state to Maine residents for business and education opportunities.\n\nFAME already offers several student loan programs that offer loan forgiveness if graduates work in the state in specific fields, such as dentistry or education. It also offers low-interest loan programs for particular fields, such as postgraduate medical, dental and veterinary education.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The measure would offer interest-free loans to those who study STEM courses and go on to work in a related job in Maine.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "description": "The measure would offer interest-free loans to those who study STEM courses and go on to work in a related job in Maine.", "title": "Panel backs bill that would give Maine residents a break on student loans - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/PHnewFBlogo.png", "updated_time": "2016-03-22T21:51:08-04:00", "url": "http://www.pressherald.com/2016/03/22/panel-backs-bill-that-would-give-maine-residents-a-break-on-student-loans/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The measure would offer interest-free loans to those who study STEM courses and go on to work in a related job in Maine.", "creator": "@pressherald", "image": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/PHnewFBlogo.png", "title": "Panel backs bill that would give Maine residents a break on student loans - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "site": "@pressherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=951845858", "fb": {"admins": 769488179, "app_id": 178078215650057}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressherald", "section": "Local & State", "published_time": "2016-03-22T19:24:08-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-22T21:51:08-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "QWs9pxQP8fwo2-nR5mWopc6qCK2D3920f7bl-U-zkso", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Maine students studying science, technology, engineering or mathematics in college would get a break on student loans through a program endorsed 9-3 Tuesday by the Legislature\u2019s Education and Cultural Affairs Committee.\nThe loans would be capped at $7,500 a year over five years, roughly the same amount as the average student loan debt carried by Maine graduates.\n1655, would offer interest-free Finance Authority of Maine loans to Maine residents who study in any of those fields in any college \u2013 including out of state \u2013 and go on to work in a related job in Maine.\nFAME is a quasi-independent state agency that distributes funds authorized by the state to Maine residents for business and education opportunities.\nFAME already offers several student loan programs that offer loan forgiveness if graduates work in the state in specific fields, such as dentistry or education."}
