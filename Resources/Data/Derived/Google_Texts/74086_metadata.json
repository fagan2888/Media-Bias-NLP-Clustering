There will be no taxpayer money or state assistance contributed to the project, said Burrell, who also founded New Mexico\u2019s Leadership Institute, which provides training and scholarships to UNM and NMSU.\n\nThe state ranks 31st in its physician-population ratio, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges, with 232 active physicians per 100,000 people. A third of those are 60 or older and may soon be retiring.\n\n\u201cWe have an older population than the national average, a poorer population than the national average, more patients will come through (the Affordable Care Act) than in any other state on a per-population basis,\u201d Burrell said. \u201cAnd we are one of the states with the least number of physicians to serve them. The trends on the demand side are going way up, whereas the supply (of physicians) is flat to declining.\u201d\n\nThe four-year Burrell College will initially admit 150 students per class, with that number growing to 300 per class over time, Burrell said. Tuition is set at $45,000 per year, and the applications to the first class will be accepted in fall 2015. About 2.5 percent of revenue will go toward scholarships.\n\nUNM School of Medicine in-state tuition is $16,170 per year, while students coming from out of state pay $46,347 annually.\n\nCarruthers, a former New Mexico governor, said he believes the agreement will make NMSU a \u201cmuch more comprehensive university\u201d and will complement existing programs in nursing and pre-med.\n\n\u201cWe also think it\u2019s very important, given our service to rural areas, that we produce more physicians for primary care in rural areas, and osteopathic physicians tend to be principally primary care doctors,\u201d he said.\n\nNationwide, medical schools produce either medical doctors (MDs) or osteopathic doctors (DOs). The American Osteopathic Association currently accredits 30 osteopathic medical schools in the U.S., and the Burrell College will seek AOA accreditation.\n\nThe AOA describes osteopathic medicine as a \u201cwhole person\u201d approach to health that, in preventing and diagnosing disease, looks at how the body\u2019s systems are interrelated and how each one affects the others. That underlying philosophy leads about 60 percent of osteopathic physicians to practice in primary care fields including family medicine, general internal medicine and pediatrics, according to the AOA.\n\n\u201cMost of the new schools that have been starting have been in areas that have been traditionally underserved, that have experienced shortages in primary care physicians,\u201d said Boyd Buser, a member of the AOA Board of Trustees and dean of the University of Pikeville-Kentucky College of Osteopathic Medicine. \u201cIt\u2019s really not surprising, because when you look at the history of osteopathic medicine, we\u2019ve always had an emphasis on producing primary care physicians.\u201d\n\nBurrell\u2019s holdings through Santa Fe-based Rosemont Realty include numerous commercial properties in Albuquerque and cities across more than 20 states, as well as an industrial garnet mine in Otero County. But the medical college is a privately financed endeavor separate from Rosemont, he said.\n\nHe describes his investment philosophy as \u201cvery focused on solving situations and problems.\u201d\n\nOne issue that has stymied medical school expansions over the past two decades is a cap on federal funding for residencies, a required part of training before a medical student can become a licensed practitioner. However, a provision of the law allows hospitals that weren\u2019t in existence when the cap was passed in the mid-1990s to apply for new Medicare-funded residencies.\n\nBurrell said the college has established relationships with a Las Cruces hospital, Mountainview Regional, and two El Paso hospitals to apply for Medicare-funded residency slots.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Real estate mogul, NMSU partner to create college of osteopathy", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Lauren Villagran | Journal Staff Writer - Las Cruces Bureau", "og": {"url": "http://www.abqjournal.com/428836/nm-to-get-private-medical-school.html", "image": "http://www.abqjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/a02_jd_14jul_college-1000x605.jpg", "type": "website", "description": "Real estate mogul, NMSU partner to create college of osteopathy", "title": "Updated: NM to get private medical school"}, "fb": {"pages": 76430478236, "app_id": 419447351433280}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9f3c\"", "article_summary": "It will be New Mexico\u2019s first private medical school and only the second after the University of New Mexico School of Medicine.\nCopyright \u00a9 2014 Albuquerque JournalLAS CRUCES \u2013 Come 2016, New Mexico State University will host a private medical school backed by Santa Fe real estate mogul Dan Burrell.\nThe American Osteopathic Association currently accredits 30 osteopathic medical schools in the U.S., and the Burrell College will seek AOA accreditation.\nBut the medical college is a privately financed endeavor separate from Rosemont, he said.\nHe describes his investment philosophy as \u201cvery focused on solving situations and problems.\u201dOne issue that has stymied medical school expansions over the past two decades is a cap on federal funding for residencies, a required part of training before a medical student can become a licensed practitioner."}
