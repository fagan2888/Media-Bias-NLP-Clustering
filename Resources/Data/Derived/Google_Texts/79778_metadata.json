Our members met with almost every U.S. Senate and House office to discuss the association\u2019s top legislative priorities. Here\u2019s why.\n\nWe support a reformed and modernized National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) and called upon Congress to extend the NFIP prior to its Sept. 30, 2017 expiration. We urge consideration of modernized mapping technologies; increased use of private reinsurance; reforms to incentivize mitigation efforts and consideration of risk-based rates, where appropriate.\n\nThe private market should act as a complement, but not a replacement to the NFIP and therefore we support S. 1679 and H.R. 2901, the \u201cFlood Insurance Market Parity and Modernization Act,\u201d by Sens. Dean Heller (R-NV) and Jon Tester (D-MT) and Reps. Dennis Ross (R-FL) and Patrick Murphy (D-FL). The legislation strikes a balance between private market involvement and the flood program, clarifies that a private policy can satisfy the mandatory purchase requirement, and ensures that policyholders can move seamlessly between the private market and the NFIP and not lose their grandfathered status.\n\nWe strongly support the Federal Crop Insurance Program (FCIP) and agents as the sole sales force of the program. The Big \u201cI\u201d opposes reopening the Farm Bill to cut the budget baseline for the FCIP and opposes S. 2244 and H.R. 3973, the \u201cAFFIRM Act,\u201d which would result in cuts to private sector delivery of crop insurance and would discourage farmers from purchasing adequate coverage for their farmland.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act\u2019s misguided \u201cCadillac tax\u201d assesses a damaging 40 percent tax on health plans that exceed a fixed annual cost. At the end of 2015, with Big \u201cI\u201d support, a two-year delay of the \u201cCadillac tax\u201d was enacted to move the effective date of the tax from 2018 to 2020. The delay was a good first step, but the Big \u201cI\u201d will continue to fight for full repeal.\n\nWe also support excluding agent compensation from the ACA\u2019s Medical Loss Ratio (MLR) formula. We support S. 1661, the \u201cAccess to Independent Health Insurance Advisors Act,\u201d by Sens. Johnny Isakson (R-GA) and Chris Coons (D-DE), and its House companion, H.R. 815, the \u201cAccess to Professional Health Insurance Advisors Act,\u201d by Reps. Billy Long (R-MO) and Kurt Schrader (D-OR).\n\nWe staunchly support state regulation of insurance and are concerned with federal encroachment. Big \u201cI\u201d agents went to Capitol Hill in support of S. 1086, the \u201cInternational Insurance Capital Standards Accountability Act,\u201d by Sens. Dean Heller (R-NV) and Jon Tester (D-MT), and H.R. 2141, the \u201cInternational Insurance Standards Transparency and Policyholder Protection Act,\u201d by Rep. Sean Duffy (R-WI).\n\nWe are concerned that a Department of Labor proposal regarding overtime requirements for \u201cwhite collar\u201d workers will be overly burdensome for small businesses including thousands of Big \u201cI\u201d members and their customers. We advocated for S. 2707 and H.R. 4773, the \u201cProtecting Workplace Advancement and Opportunity Act,\u201d by Sens. Tim Scott (R-SC) and Lamar Alexander (R-TN), and Reps. Tim Walberg (R-MI) and John Kline (R-MN), which would halt the proposal. We also hope Congress will reverse or amend the DOL regulation to expand the application of the ERISA \u201cfiduciary\u201d standard which threatens to harm investors and limit consumer access to professional advice.\n\nAlthough the work continues, another successful Big \u201cI\u201d Legislative Conference is in the books.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;polling-uri=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&polling-uri2=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&id=2;polling-uri3=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&id=3;polling-uri4=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&id=4;polling-uri5=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&id=5; cycle=1", "description": "Independent insurance agents and brokers from all 50 states convened in Washington, D.C., last month for the Big \"I\" Legislative Conference.
