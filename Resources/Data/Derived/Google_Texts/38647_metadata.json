It\u2019s just too weird, folks,\u201d Limbaugh said on his national broadcast Monday. \u201cThere just isn\u2019t any serious opposition to anything that the Democrat Party wants.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not even going through the motions,\u201d he complained. \u201cThey\u2019re not even voicing phony opposition to Obama in order to placate the base. They\u2019re actively targeting their own base.

They are all aligned. They are glued together. But the difference now is, the Republican Party doesn\u2019t even go through the motions of trying to convince its voters that they\u2019re opposed to the Obama agenda.\u201d\n\nLimbaugh said Republican leaders are not even trying to motivate the base, or even \u201cfool\u201d them.\n\n\u201cI mean, they\u2019ve had all these phony votes. For example, repeal Obamacare votes,\u201d he explained. \u201cThey\u2019re not even going through the motions of that \u2019cause they know that people see through it and that they don\u2019t mean it. They\u2019re not even trying. I don\u2019t care what the issue is. The big three: Amnesty, Obamacare, Iran. Nothing! Zilch! No opposition to anything. Now, can anybody say that immigration, as being policed or not policed by Obama is helping America? Can anybody? They don\u2019t even try to make the case that\u2019s happening. I mean, even the amnesty supporters do not do it on the basis that it\u2019s good for America.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey do it on the basis that it\u2019s \u2018fair; for the immigrants. They do it on the basis of social justice and fairness motivations and reasons. But they don\u2019t do it it\u2019s improving the country. The Iran deal. Does anybody think this is actually good for the United States? Yet there\u2019s no opposition to it, no serious opposition.\u201d\n\nRegarding President Obama\u2019s Affordable Health Care Act, Limbaugh asked: \u201cCan anybody say that Obamacare is making health care better? Can anybody say that anything that Obama is doing is? Nobody even makes the case, other than Obama with some words now and then \u2026 that the country\u2019s better off than it has been. They have to lie about employment numbers, they have to make things up. There\u2019s not even any fake opposition to Obama.\u201d\n\nLimbaugh opined there was \u201csomething else going on to explain this,\u201d and he didn\u2019t believe it was just one thing.\n\nWhile he noted many people think, \u201cIt\u2019s because the Republican Party wants to finally get rid of the conservatives, get rid of its base,\u201d Limbaugh said he didn\u2019t doubt that, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the singular explanation for this total lack of opposition.\u201d\n\nHe began naming names of the Republican leadership, including Senate Majority Leader McConnell and House Speaker John Boehner, saying, \u201cThey have turned to mush.\u201d\n\nBut the radio host is refusing \u201cto believe they have undergone ideological transplants and have all become liberals or moderates. \u2018Cause none of it makes any sense.\u201d\n\nHe discussed the well-known political adage of \u201cFollow the money.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe could speculate, you know, what does \u2018follow the money\u2019 mean?\u201d Limbaugh wondered aloud. \u201cIs there blackmail? Is there bribery going on or promises of financial wealth after retirement or whatever? Except these guys don\u2019t retire and go home. They stay there. So I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nLimbaugh noted the absence of strong Republican leadership \u201chas created a giant void,\u201d and that gap is being filled presently by billionaire businessman and GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cTrump is filling the void, which is a partial explanation for why Trump is experiencing such overwhelming support,\u201d said Limbaugh. \u201cBecause the people of this country are understandably fed up. They\u2019re fed up with all. There\u2019s no opposition to the gay-marriage agenda, and we have to listen to a Supreme Court justice tell us that if we oppose it, we\u2019re bigots or whatever.\u201d\n\n\u201cAdmit it, folks,\u201d he concluded. \u201cWhat has you bamboozled, what has you frustrated is you don\u2019t see any opposition to any of it at a level of power that could do something about stopping it. There\u2019s plenty of opposition in your neighborhood, plenty of opposition in your town, plenty of opposition in your family, plenty of opposition in your friends, but there\u2019s none where it counts.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "PALM BEACH, Florida \u2013 Rush Limbaugh, the top media voice for political conservatives, says recent behavior by Republican leadership is \u201ctoo weird,\u201d and he cannot explain why the GOP is refusing to oppose Democrats while at the same time targeting its own base. \u201cWe are all inundated by each other, every day, with e-mails, phone [\u2026]", "title": "Limbaugh mystified: Republican behavior \u2018too weird\u2019", "url": "http://www.wnd.com/2015/07/limbaugh-mystified-republican-behavior-too-weird/", "image": "http://www.wnd.com/files/2015/04/rush-limbaugh-no-glasses-hand-up-600.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 152299868169938}, "google-site-verification": "5iw1bKISvQcI1qRwIskRfer6GKV4jUf6LImfS9bhaeI", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe are all inundated by each other, every day, with e-mails, phone calls, texts, what have you, of utter incredulity over what\u2019s happened to the Republican Party.\nThere\u2019s plenty of opposition in your neighborhood, plenty of opposition in your town, plenty of opposition in your family, plenty of opposition in your friends, but there\u2019s none where it counts.\u201d\nPALM BEACH, Florida \u2013 Rush Limbaugh, the top media voice for political conservatives, says recent behavior by Republican leadership is \u201ctoo weird,\u201d and he cannot explain why the GOP is refusing to oppose Democrats while at the same time targeting its own base.\nBut the difference now is, the Republican Party doesn\u2019t even go through the motions of trying to convince its voters that they\u2019re opposed to the Obama agenda.\u201dLimbaugh said Republican leaders are not even trying to motivate the base, or even \u201cfool\u201d them.\nIt\u2019s just too weird, folks,\u201d Limbaugh said on his national broadcast Monday."}
