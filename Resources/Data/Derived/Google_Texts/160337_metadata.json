Originally a small collectible trading card business, Yamauchi took over Nintendo from his father in 1949 and proceeded to run the Japanese firm for next 53 years.\n\nThe company was facing bankruptcy after a series of failed enterprises \u2014 toy guns, baby carriages, fast food \u2014 which led the young Yamauchi to establish a policy that avoided borrowing money. Today, the company boasts nearly $9 billion in cash holdings, according to Bloomberg News, and no debt, even though Yamauchi stepped down in 2002.\n\n\"Hiroshi Yamauchi transformed a run-of the-mill trading card company into an entertainment empire in video games,\" Ian Livingstone, co-founder of Games Workshop and former chairman of publisher Eidos, told the BBC.\n\nNintendo began its conquest of the emerging video game market in 1977, after Yamauchi hired its chief game designer Shigeru Miyamoto. Miyamoto ultimately created some of the most famous video game characters in Nintendo history, including Zelda, Donkey Kong, and a jolly, red-suited plumber named Mario.\n\nHiroshi Yamauchi.

The business deal is argued to have opened the gates to Major League Baseball for Japanese baseball players, who had been previously denied access to the American sport.\n\nForbes listed Yamauchi as Japan\u2019s richest man five years ago, following the introduction and success of the Nintendo Wii. Under his guidance, Nintendo created Gameboy, Nintendo Entertainment System, Nintendo-64, and Nintendo GameCube, which are some of the most successful gaming platforms in history.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "hiroshi yamauchi, japan, nintendo, death, passed away, pneumonia", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Hiroshi Yamauchi, who was Japan\u2019s richest man in 2008, died at a hospital in central Japan.", "title": "Nintendo Video Game Pioneer, Hiroshi Yamauchi, Dead At Age 85", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/nintendo-video-game-mastermind-hiroshi-yamauchi-dead-age-85-pneumonia-257252", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/19/1755159385.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Hiroshi Yamauchi, who was Japan\u2019s richest man in 2008, died at a hospital in central Japan.", "title": "Nintendo Video Game Pioneer, Hiroshi Yamauchi, Dead At Age 85", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/nintendo-video-game-mastermind-hiroshi-yamauchi-dead-age-85-pneumonia-257252", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/19/1755159385.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/19/1755159385.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2013-09-19T09:21:23-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-19T09:21:22-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Hiroshi Yamauchi, who was Japan\u2019s richest man in 2008, died at a hospital in central Japan."}, "article_summary": "Nintendo began its conquest of the emerging video game market in 1977, after Yamauchi hired its chief game designer Shigeru Miyamoto.\nHiroshi Yamauchi, the man who morphed Nintendo into a world-leading video gaming giant, has died from pneumonia according to a statement from the company.\nMiyamoto ultimately created some of the most famous video game characters in Nintendo history, including Zelda, Donkey Kong, and a jolly, red-suited plumber named Mario.\nUnder his guidance, Nintendo created Gameboy, Nintendo Entertainment System, Nintendo-64, and Nintendo GameCube, which are some of the most successful gaming platforms in history.\nForbes listed Yamauchi as Japan\u2019s richest man five years ago, following the introduction and success of the Nintendo Wii."}
