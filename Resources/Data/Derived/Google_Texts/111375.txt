"As a result of what the Trump supporters..."

A few days ago, conservative talk radio host Mark Levin surveyed the chaos of the Republican presidential contest, drew a conclusion based on dispassionate logic, and spoke out against efforts to derail Donald Trump’s nomination.

Then things got personal.

On Friday night, not long after demolishing the #NeverTrump movement and labeling its adherents them “buffoons” for “passively” helping Hillary Clinton win the White House, Levin changed course.

“Count me as #NeverTrump,” he said on his show.

The catalyst for the change was what Levin called “sleazeball tactics” of some Trump supporters. Roger Stone, a Trump ally, and others have been intimating that Levin has been essentially bought by the GOP establishment due to the fact the Senate Conservatives Fund bought many copies of Levin’s book.

“The Senate Conservatives Fund (SCF), a ‘conservative’ fund founded by former Sen. Jim DeMint of South Carolina that backed Cruz in his Senate fight against Obamacare, spent $427,000 to buy copies of radio talk show host Mark Levin’s four-year-old book Liberty or Tyranny to distribute to donors — a purchase that should have earned Levin approximately $1 million in royalties,” The Daily Caller reported, summarizing the story.

Levin, who denied any claim of being influenced, declared, “As a result of what the Trump supporters have attempted here, particularly Roger Stone, I am not voting for Donald Trump.”

Levin said Stone, columnist Ann Coulter and others he did not name have been passing along “truly pathetic” smears.

Levin said he does not give in to bullies.

“If they piss me off one more time, I’m gonna urge millions of you, should he get the nomination, not to vote for him either,” he said.
