After a biopsy, Cooper, an 18-year veteran, was diagnosed with Stage Four prostate cancer.\n\n\u201cHad they [VA] done what was required by the medical standard of care and done PSA testing, they would have been able to treat Steve\u2019s prostate cancer a year before,\u201d Patton said. \u201cInstead, they caused a delay of at least a year, which allowed the aggressive cancer to spread to become incurable and untreatable.\u201d\n\nPatton said the $50 million sought by the suit goes beyond pain and suffering.\n\n\u201cJust because Steve\u2019s life is priceless doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s worthless,\u201d he said. \u201cWe think that is a reasonable value on Steven Cooper\u2019s life.\u201d\n\nThe Phoenix VA does not comment on pending litigation. However, spokesperson Jean Schaefer said the hospital has worked over the last two years to make changes in its urology department, including hiring more full-time staff.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve also taken a number of steps to increase the timeliness of appointments as well as how we process consults to that specific department,\u201d she said.\n\nLast month, a marine who was hit by a car after being discharged by the Phoenix Veterans Affairs hospital filed a $15.1 million lawsuit against the facility. The federal government has not yet responded to the case.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "cancer, lawsuit, phoenix va, veterans, veterans administration", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.jacobsmedia.KTAR", "og": {"site_name": "KTAR.com", "description": "An Army veteran filed a $50 million lawsuit this week against the Phoenix VA hospital alleging negligent care led to his delayed cancer diagnosis.", "title": "Veteran with cancer sues Phoenix VA for $50M", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://ktar.com/wp-content/uploads/cms/36/3686/368683.jpg", "url": "http://ktar.com/story/722919/veteran-with-cancer-sues-phoenix-va-for-50m-alleges-negligent-care/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "KTAR.com", "description": "An Army veteran filed a $50 million lawsuit this week against the Phoenix VA hospital alleging negligent care led to his delayed cancer diagnosis.", "title": "Veteran with cancer sues Phoenix VA for $50M", "image": "http://ktar.com/wp-content/uploads/cms/36/3686/368683.jpg", "creator": "@ktar923", "site": "@ktar923", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=719630055", "fb": {"pages": 42794977621, "app_id": 291385034204941}, "keywords": "Phoenix and Arizona Breaking News And News Headlines - Home, Home,92.3 KTAR", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/KTARNews", "section": "Local News", "tag": "Veterans Administration", "published_time": "2015-10-27T15:34:36+00:00"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "verify-v1": "XrJiQDsWmPaoqGKN0EHKs7ult0rBB0W9zj4cWkAPRVI=", "viewport": "width=device-width, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "An Army veteran filed a $50 million lawsuit this week against the Phoenix VA hospital alleging negligent care led to his delayed cancer diagnosis."}, "article_summary": "PHOENIX \u2014 An Army veteran filed a $50 million lawsuit this week against the Phoenix Veterans Administration hospital alleging negligent care led to his delayed cancer diagnosis.\n\u201cWe think that is a reasonable value on Steven Cooper\u2019s life.\u201dThe Phoenix VA does not comment on pending litigation.\nAfter a biopsy, Cooper, an 18-year veteran, was diagnosed with Stage Four prostate cancer.\nLast month, a marine who was hit by a car after being discharged by the Phoenix Veterans Affairs hospital filed a $15.1 million lawsuit against the facility.\n\u201cHad they [VA] done what was required by the medical standard of care and done PSA testing, they would have been able to treat Steve\u2019s prostate cancer a year before,\u201d Patton said."}
