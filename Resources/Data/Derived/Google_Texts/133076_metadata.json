The California Legislature left in tact the 10 percent cut to health care providers serving Medi-Cal patients enacted during the recession.\n\nThe increase for abortion is tucked deep within the state budget plan signed on June 20 by Governor Jerry Brown, who championed California\u2019s ability to increase welfare payments and fix budget woes. Brown signed the budget in the company of new state Assembly Speaker Toni Atkins, D-San Diego, who spearheaded AB 154, a law signed by Brown allow non-physicians to perform suction aspiration abortions.\n\nPrior to the budget approval, Catholic bishops decried increased abortion funding, calling it \u201cinsanely distorted health care.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s cheaper for state government to pay for abortions than care for mothers and children,\u201d said Rev. Jaime Soto of the California Catholic Conference. \u201cBy approving this budget, state elected officials are choosing abortion and pushing their preference on to women.\u201d\n\nThe California Department of Health Care Services states that until Long Acting Reversible Contraceptives, or LARCS, are widely utilized, the increase in abortion funding ensures that abortion is easily accessible. A lack of abortions funding will result in \u201congoing expenses for years,\u201d the report said. This is likely due to the fact that unborn children are cheaper to terminate than to raise.\n\nSupporters of the Affordable Care Act praised the Golden State for responding quickly to the implementation of the federal health care law. Brown\u2019s budget shifts an influx of uninsured individuals into the taxpayer funded Medi-Cal program, California\u2019s version of Medicaid. The program pays for medical services for low-income individuals of all ages and conditions.\n\nThe budget takes effect in the state on July 1.", "article_metadata": {"description": "California approves a 40 percent increase for abortion funding while leaving in tact a 10 percent cut to Medi-Cal.", "og": {"site_name": "Live Action News", "description": "California approves a 40 percent increase for abortion funding while leaving in tact a 10 percent cut to Medi-Cal.", "title": "California Cuts Medi-Cal 10%, increases abortion funding 40%", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://liveactionnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/pregnant-ultrasound-fetus.jpg", "height": 533}, "updated_time": "2014-06-23T21:57:34-04:00", "url": "http://liveactionnews.org/california-cuts-medi-cal-by-10-increases-abortion-funding-40/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "California approves a 40 percent increase for abortion funding while leaving in tact a 10 percent cut to Medi-Cal.", "creator": "@Becky_Yeh", "image": "http://liveactionnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/pregnant-ultrasound-fetus.jpg", "title": "California Cuts Medi-Cal 10%, increases abortion funding 40%", "site": "@liveactionnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "framework": "Alkivia Framework 0.8", "fb": {"admins": 159900244, "pages": 49651563727}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/liveactionnewsonline", "section": "Medical", "tag": "Medi-Cal", "published_time": "2014-06-23T19:07:05-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-23T21:57:34-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "In the Medi-Cal Local Assistance Estimate report for fiscal years 2013-2014 and 2014-2015, the department details plans to cut Medi-Cal while increasing payment rates for abortion services.\nThe California Legislature left in tact the 10 percent cut to health care providers serving Medi-Cal patients enacted during the recession.\nThe program pays for medical services for low-income individuals of all ages and conditions.\nThe California Department of Health Care Services will increase funding for abortion by 40 percent in an effort to provide women \u201cgreater choice in selecting a contraceptive that meets their needs\u201d to stop, delay, or limit pregnancy.\nSupporters of the Affordable Care Act praised the Golden State for responding quickly to the implementation of the federal health care law."}
