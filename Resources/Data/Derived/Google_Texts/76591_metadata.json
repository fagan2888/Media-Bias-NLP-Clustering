Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Finance Committee, certainly sounded like someone who wanted to shake hands on a big deal, after Senate Democrats met to discuss end of the year opportunities. \u201cThere is a growing appetite to find a substantial and balanced deal,\u201d Wyden said. Some aides were saying there was still a decent shot at the larger agreement, and remaining interest from both parties. Perhaps one sign that there\u2019s something to that: There hasn\u2019t been a ton of sniping, anonymous or not, from either Republicans or Democrats over how negotiations are going \u2014 certainly compared with talks over the omnibus spending bill.\n\nMOVING INTO NEXT WEEK: Democrats said for much of this week that they wanted to index to inflation the Child Tax Credit, one of the refundable tax credits for families that they want to make permanent in an extenders deal. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a hero among progressives, stressed that in no uncertain terms on Thursday: \u201cIndexing will ensure that the CTC continues to work for families in the future and gives low-wage parents the same purchasing power that others get.\u201d http://politico.pro/1HJEBnX\n\nBut while that remains the Democrats\u2019 preference, aides and lobbyists said Thursday that it looked increasingly like Senate Democrats would be willing to back off the indexing demand, as they seek to get expansions of the child credit and Earned Income Tax Credit locked in for good. \u201cThe indexing of the credit is a very important priority,\u201d said Sen. Ben Cardin, a Finance member. \u201cBut it's relative to what size package comes out and what else is in this package.\u201d\n\nStill, House Democrats might not be so willing to drop the indexing demand, and the issue of how to deal with improper payments for the EITC and child credit remains a key point of contention for the two parties. Rep. Sander Levin, the top Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee, noted that negotiations over the omnibus are overshadowing the talks on tax breaks.\n\nSo there remain plenty of reasons to think this won\u2019t come together next week, when Congress comes back for what lawmakers hope are their final few days in the Capitol in 2015.\n\nAND ANOTHER WEEK IS ALMOST IN THE BOOKS. Rest up this weekend because next week looks like a bruiser. Especially if Congress decides to take it all into next weekend. Either way, we\u2019re here for tips, corrections, ideas \u2014 you name it. Email: bbecker@politico.com, teckert@politico.com,bfaler@politico.com and kodonnell@politico.com.

Heather Caygle\u2019s story at the end: http://politico.pro/1YMnAOf\n\nCADILLAC TAX TRUCKED OVER: As it turns out, nine out of 10 senators recommend scrapping the Affordable Care Act\u2019s tax on pricy employer-sponsored insurance plans. The 90-10 vote, taken as part of the Senate\u2019s broader reconciliation bill to gut the health care law, is the first ever on repealing the controversial tax.\n\nThere\u2019s no chance for the underlying bill to become law given President Barack Obama\u2019s promise of a veto. But the overwhelming vote total underscored just how bipartisan the opposition to the Cadillac tax is, with Republicans generally disliking taxes and Obamacare, and Democrats worried about the tax\u2019s impact on their supporters in organized labor.\n\nWHAT\u2019S NEXT?: The Cadillac tax, scheduled to take effect in 2018, still has backing from the Obama administration, and economists from across the ideological spectrum. A slew of congressional Democrats want to at least delay the tax\u2019s implementation as part of a massive extenders deal. And as our Brian Faler reported this week, there\u2019s reason to believe that the White House wouldn\u2019t let its support of the Cadillac tax get in the way of a big extenders deal.\n\nStill, congressional Democrats\u2019 decision to take aim at the Cadillac tax in an extenders deal marks something of a shift for them. Many Democrats never supported the tax in the first place, but have always wanted to replace the roughly $87 billion in revenue it provides for the ACA. But there hasn\u2019t been much talk of offsetting the cost of the Cadillac tax \u2014 or any of the taxes \u2014 in a potential massive extenders deal.\n\nRep. Joe Courtney, a Connecticut Democrat sponsoring a Cadillac tax repeal bill, told Morning Tax on Thursday that Democrats made a mistake in making the case that pay-fors in the health care law needed to be replaced, noting that there are plenty of other areas in the federal government financed with deficit spending. Courtney pointed to the deal this year to end the so-called doc fix in Medicare, which wasn\u2019t all paid for. \u201cThe notion that there\u2019s this total fidelity to paying for every penny of that measure or any other tax extender, I think, is very overblown,\u201d Courtney said.\n\nOf course, one of Democrats\u2019 major selling points for the Affordable Care Act is that it reduces the federal debt over the long term.\n\n** A message from The Broad Tax Extenders Coalition: Failure to pass tax extenders would hurt families, farmers, charitable organizations and businesses.

Read Pro Health Care\u2019s Jennifer Haberkorn here: http://politico.pro/1TCVTED\n\nOther tax votes of note in Thursday\u2019s vote-a-rama: A proposal from Democrat Sherrod Brown that would\u2019ve targeted inversions to help pay for Medicaid expansion went down on a largely party-line vote. Senate Republicans voted down a proposed credit from Democrat Bob Casey that would\u2019ve established a new tax credit for working married couples with children. And a proposal from Republican Dan Coats to extend a deduction of medical expenses for seniors barely got the required 60 votes.

From Ryan\u2019s first major speech as speaker: \u201cWe want a tax code that rewards good work instead of good connections. When people know they will keep more of their hard-earned money, they will work more, save more, invest more \u2014 and create more jobs for all of us.\u201d Brian\u2019s take: http://politico.pro/1LRtnJ7\n\nGOOD NEWS, BAD NEWS: The IRS\u2019s Criminal Investigation unit initiated 3,853 cases in fiscal year 2015, with targets ranging from top FIFA officials in Europe to the founder of Happy\u2019s Pizza in Detroit, the agency reported Thursday. However, the number of cases continued to tumble \u2014 from 4,297 in FY2014 and 5,314 in FY2013 \u2014 along with the number of agents. \u201c[T]he story that the report tells this year is that fewer agents do mean fewer cases,\u201d said Richard Weber, the chief of CI. \u201cI\u2019m extremely proud of all that we accomplished in spite of our budget challenges, but the inability to hire is really taking a toll.\u201d Congressional Republicans, however, have shown little sympathy for the agency they love to hate, and are preparing to cut its budget again. Here\u2019s the report: http://bit.ly/1NK32UR\n\nNot to be ignored, the Justice Department reported that it collected a cool $350 million in penalties from dozens of Swiss banks that reached non-prosecution agreements with the department in FY2015. A Justice spokeswoman added that there were 39 Swiss banks in all that agreed to a penalty during fiscal 2015. http://1.usa.gov/1TnZuFS\n\nSPEAKING OF THE IRS\u2019S BUDGET: The agency told its watchdog, for a report released Thursday, that its budget situation left it unable to give identity theft victims a single employee to contact for their case. IRS chief John Koskinen has long said that battling refund fraud is one of the agency\u2019s top challenges. But bipartisan congressional efforts to help the IRS have gotten bogged down over the question of whether to allow the agency more power to regulate paid preparers.\n\nThe Treasury inspector general for tax administration\u2019s report found that more than one in three victims of tax fraud didn\u2019t get required case status letters from the IRS or didn\u2019t get the letter on time. http://1.usa.gov/1O6hZL2\n\nCONDOLENCES TO SAM JOHNSON: The veteran Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee lost his wife of 65 years, Shirley, on Thursday. Sam Johnson called Shirley Johnson, who was 85, \u201cthe love of my life and my best friend.\u201d Tributes to Shirley Johnson, who waited while her husband was a captive in Vietnam for seven years, at the Dallas Morning News: http://bit.ly/1MZVKst\n\nZUCKERBERG RESPONDS: Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s founder, took to \u2014 what else? \u2014 Facebook to respond to news stories that noted he would get some tax benefits by setting up a regular limited liability company instead of a foundation to follow through on his vow to give tens of billions of dollars to philanthropy. \u201cBy using an LLC instead of a traditional foundation, we receive no tax benefit from transferring our shares to the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, but we gain flexibility to execute our mission more effectively,\u201d Zuckerberg wrote. http://politico.pro/1NKwI43\n\nINTERNATIONAL NEWS \u2014\n\nWE\u2019RE NO. 31!: When it comes how much it taxes, the U.S. actually fares pretty well compared with other industrialized nations. America ranks near the bottom \u2014 31st out of 34 among Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries \u2014 in tax to GDP ratio, one way to examine a country\u2019s tax burden. The U.S., according to the OECD\u2019s latest data release, has a tax to GDP ratio of just over 25 percent, down from 28 percent at the start of this century. The entire OECD has stayed pretty level on that score, moving from 34.2 percent in 2000 to 34.4 percent in 2015.\n\nOf course, roughly three-quarters of OECD countries are in Europe, and Republicans who complain that the federal government needs to lessen the burden on taxpayers have long said that Europe shouldn\u2019t be the blueprint for tax policy and government size. (Denmark, for instance, came in first on the OECD list, crossing the 50 percent mark on tax to GDP.)\n\nBut you can also note that lawmakers like Ryan have insisted that they\u2019d like to have some of the qualities of other OECD countries\u2019 tax systems here in the U.S. The speaker, for example, likes to point to Canada\u2019s 15 percent corporate rate, less than half the 35 percent statutory rate here. But Canada\u2019s 30.5 percent tax to GDP ratio, 23rd among the OECD, is actually higher than America\u2019s. More from the OECD here: http://bit.ly/1lz5Nvh.
