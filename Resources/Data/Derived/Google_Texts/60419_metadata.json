Bill Haslam, only two months after a landslide re-election, appears willing to give in to pressure to expand Medicaid under Obamacare.\n\nHaslam is calling for a special legislative session, starting Feb. 2, to address the issue.\n\nForbes and the Washington Times have already offered scorching criticism of Haslam\u2019s plan, known as Insure Tennessee, calling it unworkable and saying taxpayers can\u2019t afford it.\n\nHaslam spokesman Dave Smith, though, called the plan \u201ca conservative approach that introduces market principles to Medicaid.\u201d He says it would provide expanded health-care coverage at no additional cost to taxpayers.\n\nThat\u2019s because, as Forbes describes, Haslam says Tennessee\u2019s hospitals have agreed to cover the state\u2019s share of rising Medicaid costs through a provider tax.\n\nBut Forbes and the Florida-based Foundation for Government Accountability don\u2019t find that argument credible, and they say the plan will ultimately burden taxpayers, based on \u201cbasic economics.\u201d\n\nForbes, citing the left-leaning Urban Institute, reports the proposed expansion would cost the state an additional $400 million per year by 2022. Federal taxpayers, Forbes adds, will kick in an extra $3.8 billion.\n\nIf the plan proves too costly, state officials \u2014 assuming they have the political will \u2014 may have to take the program from people who just got onto it.\n\nState Rep. Glen Casada, R-Franklin, said he\u2019s going into the special session with an open mind and certain reservations; he read the Forbes article and it will influence his vote.\n\n\u201cThere was a poll that shows that a majority of Tennesseans are for this, but I don\u2019t think they have the big picture.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t know the costs, and they don\u2019t know that we have to come up with $400 million in a couple of years, and we don\u2019t have that money. If the questions were asked in that context, then I think you\u2019d find the numbers switched to against expanding Medicaid in the state.\u201d\n\nCasada said he and other legislators can probably wrap up the special session in less than a week.\n\nJustin Owen, president of the Nashville-based Beacon Center of Tennessee, a free market think tank that opposes Haslam\u2019s plan, said he and his staff will work to ensure legislators don\u2019t go along.\n\n\u201cA week is an extraordinary time crunch when you are talking about billions and billions of dollars in expanding a program to 200,000 more Tennesseans,\u201d Owen said.\n\n\u201cYou need more than a week to talk about it. I think there will be more than a week of debates.\u201d\n\nOwen told Tennessee Watchdog that introducing a new entitlement to people and then taking it away is immoral.\n\nBut will a supermajority GOP Legislature go along with what Haslam wants now?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be very close,\u201d Owen said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll come down to Republicans and Republicans deciding whether to stick to principles we\u2019ve advocated for smaller government and lower taxes.\u201d\n\nOwen said he believes the hospital industry is pressuring Haslam.\n\n\u201cI think the governor has tried very hard to strike that middle ground between what the Obama administration will approve and what our General Assembly will pass, and I don\u2019t envy him being in that position.\n\nIn a statement, the Foundation for Government Accountability says federal taxpayers will actually spend an additional $22.5 billion over the next decade if Haslam\u2019s plan goes forward.\n\n\u201cHospital fees will ultimately be passed on to Tennessee consumers in the form of higher medical costs,\u201d the statement read.\n\nFurthermore, federal law already prohibits states from guaranteeing hospitals will receive their tax dollars back in the form of additional Medicaid spending, as Haslam\u2019s plan calls for.\n\n\u201cIn order to generate enough revenue to pay for the state\u2019s share of Obamacare expansion costs, Tennessee hospitals would need their patient revenues to climb to a whopping $27 billion \u2014 nearly double what they are today,\u201d the statement says.\n\nSpeaking on the governor\u2019s behalf, Smith did not address any of the concerns over Haslam\u2019s plan.\n\nContact Christopher Butler at chris@tennesseewatchdog.org\n\nFollow Tennessee Watchdog and receive regular updates through Facebook and Twitter\n\nLike Watchdog.org?
