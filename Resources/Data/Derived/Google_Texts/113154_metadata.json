But \u201c70 percent of people in the U.S. experience a problem with their vestibular system at some time in their lives,\u201d says P. Ashley Wackym, a neuro-otologist in Portland, Ore.\n\nVertigo \u2014 dizziness or difficulty maintaining your balance \u2014 is a common reason for people to seek medical help. Often the symptom is caused by a short-term problem, such as an ear infection. Other times the problem endures. That\u2019s when the condition causing the vertigo can be most difficult to diagnose.\n\nResearchers described a new disorder of the vestibular system as recently as 1998. In that condition, called superior semicircular canal dehiscence, an opening in one of the canals of the inner ear causes vertigo and/or auditory disturbances.\n\nTo the afflicted, vertigo \u2014 along with related symptoms such as ringing in the ears or hearing one\u2019s own eyes blinking \u2014 is vexing, and the sensations are difficult to describe.\n\n\u201cPatients can feel isolated and alone,\u201d says Cynthia Ryan, the executive director of the Vestibular Disorders Association, based in Portland.\n\nMisdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis is a common story for people with chronic vertigo. Wackym says his patients typically report seeing four to 10 doctors before coming to him.\n\nOur sense of balance depends on visual information from our eyes, mechanical input from our joints, and movement and positional information from our inner ears. All this gets integrated in the brain to tell us where we are in space.\n\nMore common causes of vertigo are fluid buildup in the inner ear \u2014 called Meniere\u2019s disease \u2014 and benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, or BPPV, in which calcium carbonate crystals become dislodged from their place in the inner ear and migrate into the canals. Vertigo also can be triggered by certain medications and illnesses.\n\nIn Meniere\u2019s, treatment is focused on reducing inner ear fluid. In BPPV, patients undergo the Epley maneuver, in which their heads are moved slowly through several different positions to clear the crystals.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like tilting a pinball machine to get the silver ball to go where you want,\u201d says David Zee, a professor of neurology and otolaryngology at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.\n\nVertigo is associated with migraines in some people. Sudden episodes of extreme dizziness can occur with or without a headache. Like visual auras associated with migraine, Zee calls this a vestibular aura. Sometimes these episodes are triggered by looking at things in motion, \u201csuch as disco lights or an action movie,\u201d Zee says.\n\nVertigo can be a symptom of stroke. While 2.6 million Americans go to the emergency room with vertigo every year, only about 4 percent of them have had a stroke.\n\nZee says an eye-movement exam can sometimes be better than an MRI scan for figuring out inner-ear problems. And a new device, which looks like a pair of goggles, is being tested by Johns Hopkins doctors to gauge inner-ear problems quickly at the bedside.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like an EKG of the eyes,\u201d Zee says.\n\n\u2014Jill U.
