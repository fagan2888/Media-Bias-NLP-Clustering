Michigan Ave. for sale, saying that it\u2019s gotten to be too much of a task to run both Mickey\u2019s and their Mangiamo Italian Grill restaurant which opened in 2011.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just too much to try to continue to run both places properly. My wife was very much Mickey\u2019s Dairy Twist,\u201d Pete Toarmina said. \u201cSince we\u2019ve been at the restaurant we just can\u2019t get down (to Mickey\u2019s) as much as we used to. We\u2019re not up against any kind of wall, but we just think it\u2019s time to sell it.\u201d\n\nThe Toarminas \u2013 who opened the Saline Mickey\u2019s location in 1995 \u2013 said the sale comes with both buildings on the property for a price tag of $595,000.\n\nThe business is listed at 1,350 square feet, and it comes with all of the furniture, fixtures and equipment. The second building, listed at 1,264 square feet, has been used by the family as an office building and is located next to Mickey\u2019s. Inventory will also be added to the sale price at the time of the sale.\n\nSwisher Commercial listing agent Tony Caprarese said that it\u2019s hard to tell how long the business might take to sell.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re hoping to find an interested party who will want to continue with the Mickey\u2019s tradition. The property could also be redeveloped, but the highest and best-use in value comes with selling it as the business,\u201d Caprarese said.\n\n\u201cThe place was impeccably managed and has a great reputation. They will work with the new owner for about a month in order to get them off to a good start. There\u2019s a lot of tradition and memories there. It\u2019s been a great social gathering place for people in the community and they\u2019re hoping to sell it to someone who has that same intention.\u201d\n\nPete Toarmina made the decision to sell Mickey\u2019s over Mangiamo because he thought the ice cream parlor would be easier to sell than the restaurant.\n\nHe noted that the investment into the restaurant is about four times greater than the investment into Mickey\u2019s, and the fact that there are some ongoing projects in place would make a sale of Mangiamo even harder.\n\n\u201cWe intend to open Mickey\u2019s like normal in the spring and run it the same as we\u2019ve always run it,\u201d Pete said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had some people that have become close friends and we\u2019ve been involved in their lives. Many customers have become close friends over the years and we have some employees who have become like children like us over the years.\u201d\n\nThe family considered a blind listing, but thought that the name notoriety of Mickey\u2019s might encourage a potential buyer to come forward.\n\n\u201cThis was an emotional decision for the family, and it wasn\u2019t some spur-of-the-moment decision,\u201d Caprarese said.\n\n\u201cThey had thought about this move for at least six months before deciding to sell, but it was the best decision for the family going forward.\u201d\n\nThe Saline location is one of four family owned Mickey\u2019s still in existence. Two are located in Westland and another is located in South Lyon.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "aa-business, aa-food, business", "title": "Mickey's Dairy Twist owners looking to sell iconic Saline business after nearly 20 years", "og": {"site_name": "MLive.com", "description": "Husband and wife owners Pete and Laurie Toarmina recently listed the building and the business at 751 W.
