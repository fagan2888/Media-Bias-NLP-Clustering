BIRMINGHAM, Alabama â€“ Insurance companies are cutting the number of doctors and hospitals available to their customers in a bid to cut costs that have been pushed up by the Affordable Care Act, the New York Times reports.

Citing a new study by the consulting firm McKinsey & Co., the Times reports that the percentage of plans that are so-called "narrow network" plans has increased substantially. Among the lower-cost plans available via ACA exchanges, 70 percent are now narrow-network plans. McKinsey defined narrow-network plans as those that include less than 70 percent of the doctors and hospitals in a market.

The McKinsey study found that:

Premiums for broad-network plans are 13 to 17 percent higher than premiums for narrow-network plans.

Faced with a choice between fewer choices and higher premiums, a majority of consumers knowingly opt for the cheaper plans even when more expensive ones with more choices are available.

About 10 percent of consumers don't have a choice. Narrow-network plans are their only option.

About a quarter of people who bought narrow-network plans via the ACA did not understand they would have fewer choices of doctors and hospitals.

Separately, a survey conducted by The Commonwealth Fund also found that most of the newly insured were happy with their network choices, but that 40 percent didn't know what doctors and hospitals were covered by their plan.

Writing in the Times' Upshot blog, Margot Sanger-Katz reports that the narrow-network plans are here to stay.

"...Insurers have every motivation to keep these plans on the market."
