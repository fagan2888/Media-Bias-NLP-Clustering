He made his way to Washington, working as press secretary for Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky, press secretary to Ohio\u2019s Sherrod Brown in his first U.S. Senate race, press secretary to Illinois\u2019s new senator, Barack Obama, back here as communications director for Rahm Emanuel during the 2011 campaign, and then his biggest job, national press secretary for Barack Obama during the 2012 reelection campaign.\n\nLike legions of smart political operatives before him, he\u2019s now settled in DC where, last year, he cofounded (with Robert Gibbs, Obama\u2019s White House press secretary during the first half of the first term) the Incite Agency, a political strategy and PR firm that advises advocacy organizations, non-profits, and Fortune 500 companies. (Incite advises the latter \u201con how to transform communications\u2026 defend brands under siege and tackle significant customer and public policy initiatives.\u201d)\n\nOn a visit home to see his parents\u2014his mother in La Grange and his father in the city\u2019s Edgewater neighborhood\u2014LaBolt, 32, met me the day after Christmas at Chicago\u2019s offices. I recognized him immediately in the lobby of the Tribune Tower having seen him recently on Fox News\u2019 The Kelly File arguing with Megyn Kelly about Obamacare. (Predictably, Kelly could find nothing right with the law and LaBolt could find nothing wrong.)\n\nDressed in jeans and a preppy blue Lacoste sweater over a blue checked shirt, LaBolt is good-looking and loyal, a nice guy seeming to lack the usual harder edges of people who climb the DC ladder as quickly and surefootedly as he did. He says he has no intention of returning to the campaign fray and is enjoying the more settled life as a DC PR/strategy man. He adds that he misses Chicago\u2019s neighborhoods, restaurants, and cultural offerings, but professes no desire to return here. He\u2019s single and lives in the District\u2019s historic\u2014for jazz and blues\u2014U Street Corridor.\n\nHere\u2019s an edited transcript of our conversation:\n\nI\u2019ve seen you a couple of times politely answering Megyn Kelly\u2019s aggressive criticism of the ACA. I laughed when she patronized your defense of Obamacare with, \u201cStop that. You are too smart to believe that.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m eyes-wide-open going into that. I don\u2019t think Democrats should just appear on friendly territory. Fox has a very large viewing audience for some of their shows; two million people get to hear a different viewpoint every once in a while.\u2026 I\u2019m always open to doing Fox if they\u2019re clear about what the topic that\u2019s going to be discussed is; clear about what you\u2019re signing up for and you\u2019re actually going to have a dialog on the show, don\u2019t just get talked over\u2026.I think it\u2019s important not to just sing to the choir all the time\u2026 Also, remember, there are independents who watch [Fox]. We took a look at that during the campaign.\n\nAny interesting experiences in the green room?\n\nI\u2019ve bumped into Karl Rove\u2014we had contiguous segments\u2014but that\u2019s the DC experience. It\u2019s a smaller town than you think, and you overlap with a lot of people you see at events\u2026. We joked around about our different viewpoints. I\u2019ve never met anyone [there] who\u2019s been unpleasant.\n\nGrowing up in La Grange, what sparked your interest in politics? Were your parents political?\n\nIt\u2019s in your blood if you grow up in and around Chicago. Big personalities, one of the last cities left with a political reporter at every TV news station, and there are four stories in the paper about the mayor every day. Politics always mattered and you could always tell that it mattered. My parents weren\u2019t involved in politics day to day\u2014they were democrats\u2013but they read the Tribune religiously. I would read it after my dad read it at breakfast.\n\nYour political activity started in college?\n\nIn my first year, Howard Dean was governor and had just passed civil unions, first state in the country, and there was a really nasty gubernatorial race that year against Dean. I just volunteered. It was also a presidential election year, so we\u2019d drive down to New Hampshire during the primaries. We\u2019d also do things like put together a phone bank for the local state rep candidate. A winning margin in Vermont is something like a thousand votes, and so if people at my college came out and voted that was the margin of the campaign, and so it was fun to work on something so small where you knew that if you engaged X number of people you would tip the results of the race.\n\nWhen I got out of college my first job was working on the New Hampshire primary [in 2004] for Gov. Dean.\n\nDid you consider another line of work than politics?\n\nI always thought I\u2019d go to law school, took the LSAT in college and at some point I just decided I found my career and I didn\u2019t need to get a JD and spend the next five years editing briefs at 3 am working to pay off my loans.\n\nHow did you and Robert Gibbs get together? He\u2019s older and better known.\n\nRobert hired me in [early] 2007 just as Sen. Obama made the decision to run [for president] and he and the other person in the senate office who managed communications there, Tommy Vietor, both headed out to do the presidential campaign, so they needed somebody to do the day-to-day communication in the senate office.\n\nAt your new venture, Incite, do you and Gibbs lobby?\n\nIt\u2019s strategic communications, and so the vision for the business is to apply all the different communications strategies that we learned on campaigns and in the government to a variety of organizations. They might be companies; they might nonprofits or causes or foundations; or they might be campaigns.\n\nDo you work with Republicans as well as Democrats? Would an organization with a conservative bent come to you?\n\nIf somebody is pursuing an ideologically conservative agenda, that wouldn\u2019t be a good match for us. On the business side [we work for them] unless they\u2019re engaged in something we wouldn\u2019t want to be engaged in. If they have a basic business agenda and we can help them structure their communications\u2026. A lot of Republicans have reached out to us because they already have the Republican perspective in the room and they wonder if we approach something in a different way or if there\u2019s a lesson we learned on a campaign\u2026 that they could use to their benefit.\n\nFirms like yours almost always seem to have a Republican and a Democrat at the top. Does Incite have any Republicans?\n\nWe don\u2019t have a Republican on our staff at this stage, but I think that\u2019s largely because we\u2019re so small\u2014five professionals\u2014and just starting. I imagine we will some day. That\u2019s certainly important, particularly important for a lobbying shop, and we\u2019re not a lobbying shop, but I think that\u2019s the sort of team we\u2019d like to build in the long run. I think we will have a Republican on staff.\n\nDo you work for particular candidates; for candidates running in \u201914?\n\nNot full-time, but we\u2019ve dabbled, such as helping out Democrats who are supporting education reform.\n\nDo you miss working on campaigns?\n\nIt\u2019s different. There\u2019s a certain adrenaline that comes with that, and the experience of the team is always rewarding. But it takes up your entire life and you\u2019re never sure if you could take a trip or go to a wedding or even go out to dinner, so it\u2019s nice to be not as attached to something like that. At the same time, I stay in close touch with people in politics day to day. I know that we\u2019ll be involved politically in a number of projects, as mentioned, helping out democrats with education reform, so it feels like I have a foot in both worlds right now\u2026. My two top priorities politically in the next couple of years are seeing democrats keep the senate and seeing the mayor reelected here.\n\nIs it possible you\u2019ll leave business and get back into politics?\n\nI think I can do both right now. I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019ve completely left and I think that\u2019s a good place to be. I don\u2019t see myself sitting in-house for two years ever again. I think I\u2019ll hand that off to the next generation of people that has the energy and motivation to work those 18-hour days for two years. I\u2019m happy to be the guy that comes into town and takes everybody out to dinner and offers some advice, but no I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll miss the constant activity and commitment.\n\nI was surprised when Robert Gibbs publicly criticized the ACA rollout and called for someone to be fired. Is there some bitterness between him and Obama dating from Gibbs being marginalized during the \u201912 campaign?\n\nNot at all. NBC hired Robert to be an analyst, not a surrogate, and to give a frank assessment of what\u2019s happening in the news. And secondly he was frustrated that there were staff that did a disservice to the president on his signature accomplishment, a big piece of his legacy. There were a lot of people looking at the ACA as a test of what government can do, and the people who worked on the web site failed in that process\u2026. I think Robert felt like that. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anybody at the White House who disagrees with that assessment.\n\nSo how did it happen that Obama knew so little about the kinks in the system that resulted in the launch blowup? Staffers not wanting to be the purveyor of bad news, or the President\u2019s mind being elsewhere?\n\nI think a couple of things. One, it isn\u2019t clear to me that the people who produced the website offered accurate reports as to its functionality. Second, there were too many people involved in the bureaucratic process of developing the site. There were 55 contractors involved and there were a bunch of people in charge, when they should have filtered out to one person who could really do what they do in Silicon Valley when they\u2019re reviewing a new web site, which is have as many people test it out as possible to figure out what the errors are in the site and then learn from that\u2026.\n\nI think the hole in the operation was not having one person designated to be the person responsible for ACA implementation\u2026. You have to have a more efficient, transparent accountable process where you catch errors along the way\u2026. The biggest surprise of going to work in the White House is after the President has made a commitment to something and after a law has been passed there\u2019s still a number of bureaucratic barriers within the executive to getting that thing done.\n\nI still don\u2019t understand how President Obama knew so little; it seems like he was expecting it would work well.\n\nIt seems clear to me that people were reporting up that it was ready to go: the Travelocity of websites for healthcare. Nobody wants to disappoint the President, so\u2026 somebody communicated a report about functionality that whitewashed\u2026 what was going on with the site, or they tested it insufficiently to know what the errors were\u2026. At the end of the day what\u2019s going to matter is how many people enroll and are they satisfied with their health care and do health care costs general go down.\n\nHow long will that take?\n\nThat\u2019s the political question, right? Does that happen by November 2014 or does it take more time?\n\nShould the President have fired Kathleen Sebelius?\n\nRemember all of this was before the Senate nomination process was reformed and so if he\u2019d gotten rid of her there would never have been another HHS secretary confirmed in this senate, so I think doing it at that time would have been a mistake. I also think it\u2019s wrong to jump to conclusions about who was at fault until you\u2019ve really seen the report, whether that\u2019s a congressional report or IG report about who ultimately was responsible for the oversight of the process and the contractors. I don\u2019t feel qualified to make an assessment.\n\nIs bringing in John Podesta a good step?\n\nAbsolutely. I think it was a very tough year for the President. Nobody sugarcoats that and getting a fresh set of ideas from somebody who built the smartest Democratic think tank in Washington [Center for American Progress], has a ton of policy ideas, and also somebody who came in toward the end of an administration [Clinton\u2019s] when we were able to get less through Congress and still made progress on the agenda. [LaBolt refers here to Podesta\u2019s penchant for bypassing congress through the use of executive orders.]\n\nPolitico\u2019s Glenn Thrush reported that Podesta has a temper so scary that \u201ceven the brash Rahm Emanuel scrambled for cover.\u201d\n\nLet me just say that I\u2019ve never seen Rahm take cover\u2026I loved working for him. I\u2019d kill to have a mayor like him in D.C. I thank god when my garbage gets picked up in that town. He has great political instincts. Everybody knows that, but he\u2019s also a lot more of a policy wonk than a lot of people think. He\u2019s somebody who has 15 ideas about what to do before 6:30 every morning\u2026 limitless energy; more energy than anybody on staff.\n\nDoes he have national ambitions?\n\nI don\u2019t think he does. I think he loves the city too much to leave it. I think he thinks being mayor of Chicago is the greatest job in the world and he\u2019s able to spend all day doing his job, but then be home with his family, raise them, and eat at some of the best restaurants in the world and go out and see music or a play at some of the best places in the world, and I don\u2019t think he has interest in leaving that.\n\nI see many similarities between Michael Bloomberg and Rahm.\n\nOne of the big similarities is they\u2019re both very outcome-oriented, so rather than being ideological for ideology\u2019s sake, it\u2019s looking at what are the top three problems in the city and who\u2019s the person in the world who knows how to solve that problem the best.\n\nI also think they have extremely strong networks and personal relationships. It\u2019s interesting that clout is a bad word but it\u2019s not a bad word anywhere else in the country. It\u2019s a bad word for a good reason in Chicago\u2026 far too much corruption in this city for far too long, but I think the Mayor\u2019s personal relationships that have allowed him to get major CEOs on the phone to move businesses and operations here and his relationships around the world have enhanced the status of the city. So in that way I think the Mayor\u2019s personal clout has been helpful because he won\u2019t take no for an answer and he\u2019s got all these relationships with elected officials and business leaders and cultural leaders in the US and around the world that I think have benefitted the city.\n\nWere you ever on receiving end of his temper or profanity?\n\nI think a lot of that is legend and I think he has probably calmed down over the years. I think what\u2019s interesting is the fact of how long people work for him and how loyal they are to him. I think that\u2019s because he treats his staff with respect. I think most people who worked for him also respect the fact that he\u2019s not a BS artist. If someone\u2019s coming in and telling him time and time again that they\u2019re going to do something that they have no intention of doing he\u2019s stops them right there.\n\nHe\u2019s obviously running in \u201915 and I see him staying for maybe two terms. Do you see him as a Rich Daley or a Richard J, as being mayor for life?\n\nI think he could be if he wanted to, but I don\u2019t think being mayor for life is his intention.\n\nTwo-term mayor?\n\nI don\u2019t know the answer to that and I\u2019d be surprised if he knew the answer to that. But he ran at a big transition point for the city. He ran on a tough-love message of addressing the big challenges that the city was facing that hadn\u2019t been addressed\u2014the economy, the deficit in particular, and crime and schools, and I think he\u2019s maniacal about making sure that those three things are addressed and I don\u2019t think he\u2019s gonna rest or stop until he feels like we\u2019ve made significant progress in all those ways.\n\nDaley has become the great villain in the reporting about Chicago. He has taken a dive in public opinion here like I\u2019ve never seen before. Bigger dive even than someone accused of corruption. He\u2019s accused of, in effect, planting flowers while Rome burned.\n\nI think it\u2019s framed like that in the press\u2026. For people like me who grew up with him being the mayor he will always be a legend. There are few people who think that the city would be as much of an international city and have reached the heights that it did if he hadn\u2019t been mayor. I think the current mayor has a lot of respect for him.\n\nDid President Obama want Rahm out of the White House?\n\nI think the timing of Rahm\u2019s leaving the White House was the surprise decision by Mayor Daley not to run again, and I think the President has said many times that the only person who could have gotten his very ambitious agenda\u2014Recovery Act, Affordable Care Act, Wall Street reform\u2014through Congress was Rahm. He\u2019s the only person who had the relationships and the tenacity to get that agenda through.\n\nDuring the mayoral campaign, did you and Rahm\u2019s other staffers worry about the residency issue, especially when the judge\u2019s ruling came down?\n\nThere\u2019s potential peril involved and it was important for the mayor to project confidence, but the best chance anybody had to beat him was to make sure that he didn\u2019t run at all, and so it was strange dragging us political professionals into a court room\u2026. Ultimately I think that was a disservice to the city when we should have had a five-month dialog about education and crime and pensions and the deficit. And it turned the mayor into a victim because of old school, brass-knuckled political tactics trying to drop him from the ballot.\n\nMrs. Rahm, Amy Rule, has a very limited public role.\n\nI think she has always been a very private person who focused on raising a family. That being said I think she\u2019s gotten into the job of being first lady, particularly with her organization that helps out students from underprivileged backgrounds get internships and help with long-term education and career prospects.\n\nShe seems the opposite of [New York Mayor Bill] De Blasio\u2019s wife who really is in the mix.\n\nI think [for Amy Rule] it\u2019s less photo-ops but more sort of substantive work on the issues that matter to her.\n\nYou mentioned before that you read both Chicago papers on line\u2014and extremely thoroughly. Are there reporters here whom you particularly respect?\n\nI think the model political reporter is Dan Balz (of the Washington Post); the sort of gold standard of Washington political reporters, \u2026.if you want someone who is fair and impartial.\n\nWhat about the Sun-Times and the Tribune?\n\nLynn Sweet is a legend for her relentlessness. I remember a couple of press conferences when I was working for Sen. Obama where she was sitting under the podium clutching the podium shouting questions from under it. Plenty of good reporters at the Tribune, Christie Parsons, Rick Pearson.\n\nYou\u2019ve worked for lots of politicians. You have a favorite?\n\nObviously it\u2019s a singular experience to have been on the ground floor of electing the first African-American president. If I look back at the end of my life that would be at the very top of any list that\u2019s made. I had a blast working for the mayor here because he\u2019s such a dynamic personality. He\u2019s so filled with ideas and so ready and willing to go act on something.\n\nDid you sign up for Obamacare?\n\nNo, I have employer-based health care\u2026. I was on the individual market earlier this year with one of those crappy plans, catastrophic coverage. Had I remained self-employed I would have gone on the exchange and it would have been, I assume, better than my individual market plan. It wasn\u2019t very good and you have to fill out a 30-page medical history just to qualify.\n\nCarol Felsenthal is a lifelong Chicagoan and self-proclaimed political junkie.
