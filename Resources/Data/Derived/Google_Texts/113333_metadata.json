I have always been proud of being allowed to serve my country and also achieving the signal honor of being initiated into the fraternity of Chief Petty Officer (CPO) of the United States Navy.\n\nThrough the years, however, there has always been a struggle within me when someone thanks me for my service.\n\nWhen thanked, the first thought I always have is one of surprised gratitude that there are citizens who still recognize the value of military service. That event warms my heart.\n\nREAD ALSO: On Armed Forces day, VA scandal leaves Veterans waiting for care\n\n\n\nThen comes the ever occurring guilt of trying to find the proper response to the compliment. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome\u201d is not a proper response from my perspective. It was my honor to have served. I should be the one thanking America for the opportunity to serve. No thanks needed or wanted. My response of \u201cIt was my honor\u201d leaves me feeling guilty of a prideful boasting that I served.\n\nThis guilt of pride is all about what I was allowed to do and what I was allowed to accomplish. Thanks to the Navy I have been places and experienced things that most people would pay big money for the price of admission. See me back then and you saw a top of his game CPO. That pride lives on, but grows dimmer with time and telling.\n\nI am also embarrassed that I am no longer that person. To tell people how glorious that time was seems to be nothing but empty boasting, however well intentioned.\n\nThe guilt of being mistaken for a hero comes to worry me every time a veteran\u2019s event occurs. I am no hero by any stretch of the story, and I did nothing remotely heroic for all twenty years served. I saw heroes in action and have seen or heard stories of heroes. All that I can lay claim to is being true to my oath of enlistment and standing on the proverbial wall. Do not mistake me for any of those great ones that paid the price required of true heroes.\n\nREAD ALSO: NASCAR: BOOGITY, to the Third Power and the Duck Nation\n\n\n\nThe Navy may have brought Barbara and I together, however there is always the guilt of the time stolen from my family. I am that thief. I stole from my children and from my wife. I gave that time to the Navy. Barbara, on the other hand, had the toughest job in the Navy \u2013 Navy Wife. She was and is jealous of the Navy. Rightly so, but with a wisdom that I lacked in this matter, she allowed me to pursue my dreams in the Navy. For that alone I thank her and owe her for the rest of our days. My children, on the other hand, consider being called Navy Brats as the highest among honors. Go figure.\n\nI am guilty of loving the Navy and the ships too much. So much so was this love that separation from the Navy left me feeling guilt ridden and in anguish over abandoning the Brotherhood. Realizing that I could no longer contribute was the cause of a great and dark depression. That is all behind me now and I have moved forward. Now I cherish those memories of days/weeks/months at sea, sailors as close as brothers, and challenging events on the horizon\n\nFinally, I am completely guilty of telling sea stories. The stories that are told always contain elements of truth, humor, and amazement. They are meant to entertain as well. They are my hard earned right and privilege to tell. I intend them to educate you and amaze you and to also satiate that longing within me to remain forever young and at sea. If by chance it inspires another to serve then we are all twice blessed.\n\nOf all these things I am guilty of because that is who I am. A veteran shaped by the decisions made and the course laid in. A volunteering of service that rewarded the giver more than the gift. All that I ever did was my duty. To be allowed the memory of that is all the reward or thanks I\u2019ll ever need, Thank you.\n\nRetired United States Navy CPO, Paul D. Clark\n\nRead more at http://allenwestrepublic.com/2013/11/12/the-guilt-of-a-veteran-by-paul-d-clark-retired-us-navy-cpo/#503GwUDOPmBdWxuM.99", "article_metadata": {"description": "Through the years, however, there has always been a struggle within me when someone thanks me for my service.", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "Paul Clark", "og": {"site_name": "Communities Digital News", "description": "Through the years, however, there has always been a struggle within me when someone thanks me for my service.", "title": "Armed Forces Day: The guilt of a Navy veteran", "url": "http://www.commdiginews.com/life/armed-forces-day-the-guilt-of-a-navy-veteran-17709/", "image": {"width": 620, "identifier": "http://www.commdiginews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/USNavy-CPO-Paul-Clark.jpg", "height": 427}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Through the years, however, there has always been a struggle within me when someone thanks me for my service.", "creator": "@commdiginews", "image": "http://www.commdiginews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/USNavy-CPO-Paul-Clark-435x375.jpg", "title": "Armed Forces Day: The Guilt of a Navy Veteran", "site": "@commdiginews", "card": "summary"}, "propeller": "a20eada6e38f74d5c5bf31354ee9760c", "keywords": "veteran,navy,armed forces day,usn,usnavy,veterans", "article": {"published_time": "2014-05-17T17:05:31+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-05-17T20:59:25+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Armed Forces Day, USN, USNavy, veterans"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2e1c\"", "article_summary": "Barbara, on the other hand, had the toughest job in the Navy \u2013 Navy Wife.\nRetired United States Navy CPO, Paul D.
