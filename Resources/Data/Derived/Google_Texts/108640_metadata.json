Ryan Zinke of Montana named Scott Hommel, the former treasurer of the political action committee that spent nearly $200,000 in support of Zinke\u2019s candidacy, as his chief of staff Monday.\n\nHommel is a military veteran and former treasurer of Special Operations For America PAC, or SOFA PAC, that Zinke founded in 2010.\n\nZinke resigned as chairman of SOFA just weeks before announcing his run for Congress in 2013. SOFA PAC reported spending just over $175,000 on behalf of Zinke\u2019s candidacy and just over $17,000 against his challenger in the Republican primary, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.\n\nThe spending has been the subject of at least two complaints filed with the Federal Election Commission alleging the PAC coordinated its efforts with Zinke\u2019s campaign. The campaign has denied any coordination.\n\nSuper PACS are allowed to spend money to support or oppose candidates, but they are not allowed to coordinate with candidates or their campaigns.\n\nA spokeswoman for Zinke did not immediately return a request for comment Tuesday.\n\nMontana Democratic Party spokesman Bryan Watt said the move shows Zinke is handing out favors to his \u201cdark money friends.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need a congressman who puts Montana before his special interest cronies, and Ryan Zinke is already failing Montana \u2013 even before he has cast his first vote,\u201d Watt said.\n\nZinke also named Micah Chambers as his legislative director, Heather Smith as his communications director and Jocelyn Galt as his scheduler.\n\nZinke announced previously he hired former U.S. House Rep. Denny Rehberg\u2019s state director Randy Vogel to oversee his state offices in Billings and Helena. Those offices opened Tuesday.\n\nZinke was sworn in Tuesday as the lone Montana U.S. House Representative and first Navy SEAL in Congress. He defeated Democrat John Lewis in the November midterm election.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Flathead Beacon", "description": "U.S. Rep.
