But most U.S. women still aren\u2019t aware of this aspect of Obamacare, according to researchers who have been tracking public perception about the law\u2019s new contraceptive coverage.\n\nPhoenix Marketing International conducted three separate surveys on this topic over the past year, and every time, the company found that fewer than half of women between the ages of 18 and 45 knew about Obamacare\u2019s birth control coverage. The first two surveys found that about 45 percent of women knew that the full cost of FDA-approved contraception should be covered by insurance companies. That number ticked up very slightly in the third survey, to 48 percent \u2014 but that still means that half of the women in the country may not realize that the birth control method of their choice is more affordable now.\n\nOn the one-year anniversary of Obamacare\u2019s birth control provision, the Health and Human Services Department estimated that about 27 million women are now eligible for no-cost contraception. But if Phoenix\u2019s research is any indication, many of them may not yet be taking advantage of that.\n\nAnd even among the women who do know that the new birth control provision exists, Phoenix\u2019s latest survey reveals that there\u2019s still some confusion about how it works in practice. Just 40 percent of women realize that brand-name oral contraceptives, in addition to their generic counterparts, are completely covered. And less than a quarter are aware that they can get a non-hormonal IUDs without being charged a co-pay \u2014 an important aspect of the health reform law, since co-pays for IUDs used to be hundreds of dollars.\n\nKristen McNeill, a researcher for Phoenix Marketing International, told CNBC that the education gap may reflect the fact that a lot of people still remain confused about Obamacare in general. But she also thinks that pharmaceutical companies bear some responsibility in this area. McNeill pointed out that Big Pharma hasn\u2019t done big advertising pushes to highlight the birth control provision. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t the pharma companies taking advantage of this opportunity that\u2019s being handed to them?\u201d McNeill asked.\n\nAlthough some participants in Phoenix\u2019s surveys did say they heard about their new contraceptive coverage options from their doctor, not every medical professional is doing a good job at explaining the new benefits under the health reform law, either. More broadly, not every general practitioner is talking about contraception with their female patients at all. One recent study found that the vast majority of women don\u2019t have all the facts about their different birth control options, yet don\u2019t receive counseling on the subject from their health care professional.\n\nReproductive health advocates have been attempting to do their part to get out the word about how Obamacare impacts women. Planned Parenthood recently ran a campaign collecting stories from Americans who have already benefited from the contraception provision. And earlier this month, sexual health organizations held the first annual \u201cThanks, Birth Control\u201d Day to spur more conversations about how women are using modern contraception in their own lives.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Pharmaceutical companies aren't doing a good enough job of advertising the fact that the full cost of their contraceptives are now covered by insurance.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Pharmaceutical companies aren't doing a good enough job of advertising the fact that the full cost of their contraceptives are now covered by insurance.", "title": "Most Women Don\u2019t Know About Obamacare\u2019s Birth Control Coverage", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2013/11/21/2976931/obamacares-birth-control-coverage-knowledge-gap/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/shutterstock_137522837.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Pharmaceutical companies aren't doing a good enough job of advertising the fact that the full cost of their contraceptives are now covered by insurance.", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/shutterstock_137522837-321x214.jpg", "title": "Most Women Don\u2019t Know About Obamacare\u2019s Birth Control Coverage", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/shutterstock_137522837.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/shutterstock_137522837.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-21T09:58:21+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbb53\"", "article_summary": "Health Most Women Don\u2019t Know About Obamacare\u2019s Birth Control Coverage CREDIT: ShutterstockObamacare\u2019s birth control benefit \u2014 the provision of the health reform law that allows women to access a range of preventative health services at no extra charge \u2014 has been in effect for over a year.\nMcNeill pointed out that Big Pharma hasn\u2019t done big advertising pushes to highlight the birth control provision.\nOn the one-year anniversary of Obamacare\u2019s birth control provision, the Health and Human Services Department estimated that about 27 million women are now eligible for no-cost contraception.\nAnd even among the women who do know that the new birth control provision exists, Phoenix\u2019s latest survey reveals that there\u2019s still some confusion about how it works in practice.\nPlanned Parenthood recently ran a campaign collecting stories from Americans who have already benefited from the contraception provision."}
