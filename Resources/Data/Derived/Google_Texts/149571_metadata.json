Dick Durbin and challenger Jim Oberweis sparred Wednesday night in their first meeting on a formal debate stage, with the rivals arguing over whether the incumbent's experience is an asset or a liability.\n\nRepublican state Sen. Oberweis, 68, cast Durbin as a \u201csmooth talker\u201d and a \u201ccareer politician\u201d whose time in office should be up.\n\nDurbin, 69, the Democratic front-runner, said his long tenure in the Senate \u2014 he is seeking a fourth six-year term \u2014 is exactly the reason why voters should return him to Washington.\n\nIn his opening statement, Durbin said the Nov. 4 election was about helping working families in Illinois, rewriting the tax code to keep companies in America and letting students renegotiate student loans. The U.S. senator highlighted the millions of people who have benefited from the Affordable Care Act.\n\nOberweis, in his opener, said that he would offer Illinoisans \u201ca different way forward\u201d and draw on his skills as a businessman to create better opportunities for people.\n\nThe candidates both touted working in a bipartisan manner.\n\nOberweis said that in his time in Springfield, he had \u201cstayed with my principles\u201d but also worked with the other side.\n\nDurbin pointed to immigration legislation and other bipartisan efforts he's been involved in during his time in the Senate.\n\n\u201cI work with Republicans, and we get results,\u201d he said.\n\nOberweis, when asked about the prospect of the Senate switching to GOP control, said it would mean a \u201creal opportunity\u201d to pass bills blocked by Durbin and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev.\n\n\u201cIt means that we as Republicans would be forced to work with the president,\u201d Oberweis added.\n\nThe Republican said the average Illinois family earns $5,053 a year less since Durbin\u2019s last election, which was in 2008. Oberweis said he would help kids get a better education with better schools.\n\nDurbin said his experience in the Senate had helped Illinois, arguing that the state now receives more federal dollars for highways, bridges and transit than in the past.\n\nThe candidates also fielded questions on Ebola, gun control, gay marriage, an increase in the minimum wage and equal pay for men and women.\n\nThe candidates were asked whether they supported a federal standard on same-sex marriage, which is legal in Illinois and several other states.\n\nDurbin, who has led throughout the race in polling and fundraising, unequivocally said yes. Oberweis said he would prefer the issue be decided by individual states, but that same-sex marriage was now \u201cwell established\u201d and that \u201cthere\u2019s no arguing about it any longer.\u201d\n\nPressed to clarify his stance \u2014 Oberweis last year voted against Illinois\u2019 same-sex marriage law \u2014 he said: \u201cTime has passed, and I believe courts have said that that is the law, and I will uphold the law of the land.\u201d\n\nOn the federal government\u2019s response to the Ebola crisis, Durbin said things were going \u201cin the right direction.\u201d He pointed to the Republican Party\u2019s tea party faction, saying its supporters have made the problem worse by forcing reductions in federal spending.\n\nOberweis said the government\u2019s response had been too slow and that Durbin \u201cshould be picking up the phone\u201d to pressure President Barack Obama to do more.\n\nThe candidates were asked if they would agree to pull their negative ads from the airwaves.\n\nDurbin said that Oberweis had opened up with almost a million dollars of negative advertising and that if his rival wanted to pull those ads, he would follow suit.\n\nOberweis demurred, noting that super PACs would not be obligated to do the same.\n\nDurbin, the Senate\u2019s No. 2 Democrat, said he supports a ban on assault weapons. Oberweis said he supported Second Amendment rights and would support such a ban only if there were evidence it would reduce violence.\n\nAs he has done repeatedly in recent weeks, Durbin linked Oberweis to tea party conservatism.\n\nDurbin referred to a statement Oberweis made earlier in the year to tea party activists that they should \u201ctake over the Republican Party.\u201d\n\nOberweis said he meant that tea party activists should get involved in the GOP\u2019s establishment wing.\n\nThe debate was hosted in the WLS-Ch. 7 studios in Chicago. Anchor Kathy Brock moderated the event, which was sponsored by the League of Women Voters of Illinois.\n\nThe candidates will meet again next Wednesday at a forum that will be broadcast by WTTW-Ch. 11.\n\nkskiba@tribune.com\n\nTwitter @KatherineSkiba", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Durbin, Oberweis clash on immigration, health care in debate", "Description": "U.S. Sen.
