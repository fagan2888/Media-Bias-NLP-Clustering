Five people were taken to Fort Worth hospitals after a head-on collision Sunday evening near Burleson.

The crash, which occurred about 6:50 p.m., shut down both lanes of FM 917 near Interstate 35W, Burleson spokeswoman Sally Ellertson said.

A 2012 Honda CRV driven by a 67-year-old Burleson woman left the westbound lane and struck a 2013 Kia Optima that was in the eastbound lane head-on. The Kia was carrying a 36-year-old Cleburne man and his three passengers, a 30-year-old woman and two boys, she said.

All five people, including the two children, were in critical condition, MedStar spokesman Matt Zavadsky said.

The boys, ages three and nine-years-old, were taken to Cook Childrenâ€™s Medical Center, the two women were taken to John Peter Smith Hospital and the man was transported to Texas Health Harris Methodist Hospital, he said.

A second crash involving five people occurred at the location, but all the injuries in that accident were minor, Zavadsky said.

The crash shut down both lanes of the road for about an hour, but they were reopened by 8:15 p.m.
