NPR’s Indira Lakshmanan sat down with Rocco Palmo this weekend to talk about Pope Francis, two years into his papacy.

LAKSHMANAN: Can he compel priests and cardinals to follow his example, or is this just him expressing a personal opinion and hoping that they fall into line? PALMO: As for the leadership of the church, you know, there are many who are on board with him, but one of the perks of being pope is that you have the exclusive power to appoint all the bishops in the world, and especially powerfully this weekend, you know, the members of the College of Cardinals who will elect his successor. And, you know, calling in these guys not from the great prestigious cities in the world, bypassing the United States again for the first time in 40 years, you know. You have new cardinals from Tonga, which has never had a cardinal before; from the Cape Verde Islands, places that never been thought of having a cardinal. And somebody said to me, it’s not that these guys are going to elect the next pope, it’s that one of them can be the next pope. And if that happens, you know, again, the pope has absolute power in the church. So it’s basically, for anyone who wants to go back to the way things were before Francis, it’s game over.
