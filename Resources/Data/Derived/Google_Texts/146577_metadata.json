It is one of the most expensive home purchase cities in the world, given our relatively low incomes.\n\nThe intense debate on freeing up land for development at the boundaries of Auckland City and intensification of existing suburbs, is a very necessary discussion to have, Atkinson says.\n\nDumping an urban growth boundary is not the sole solution, but needs to be investigated, he adds.\n\nNow there are as many as 800 extra residents flowing into the Queen City each week according to the higher estimates, though official figures are considerably less than that.\n\nNew Zealand\u2019s biggest city accepts by far the majority of new migrants to New Zealand, but because of the impact of the global financial crisis particularly in the years from 2008 through to 2011 there has been a shortage of new housing projects in Auckland.\n\nThe city has a shortfall of many thousands of homes. That is stretching to breaking point the social fabric of a country, once seen as one of the most egalitarian societies in the world.\n\nThe Generation Homes team have not been a passive onlookers to this problem. In the last 12 months they have had intense negotiations with land owners in the North Island with some success.\n\nBut for real progress on a widely felt problem the company wants more focus on freeing up land.\n\nSections have been in short supply partly because some developers have been land banking, compounded by Resource Management Act issues. Some councils around New Zealand have stung subdivision projects with onerous development contributions.\n\n\u201cOur observation is that there are still bottlenecks in some council processes. Obtaining consents in some areas is still taking too long. We want councils to review their signing authorities. For example, senior staff should operate at a higher level such as in the area of infrastructure provision, rather than lower level staff who don\u2019t have authority to make decisions and have to go and get approval from their bosses causing unnecessary delays to the building process.\n\nThe shortage of affordable housing, highlighted by the stories of Kiwis living on the streets, has helped drive up home prices. This has meant other initiatives like the Government Home Start initiative has not been as effective as it could be, Atkinson says.\n\nThe $435 million HomeStart scheme came into effect on April 1, 2015 for KiwiSaver contributors. Couples can apply for grants of up to $10,000 for a deposit on an existing home and up to $20,000 for a new-build.\n\nAtkinson is a big fan of the scheme and says Generation Homes has a strong emphasis on customers getting on to the property ladder, and adding their \u201cown personality\u201d to a first home.\n\nSince its establishment in Tauranga in 1997 Generation Homes has partnered with landowners to develop residential subdivisions exceeding $340 million in value across the country.\n\nSo holding a \u201cworking land supply\u201d has always been core to the high quality packages the building group offers. Efforts to secure extra land have not been instantly rewarded. Instead it is a long, therefore costly process.\n\nGeneration Homes uses a collaborative approach with landowners on what can be complex developments. It often passes on development margins to land owners as it works to lower the risk they face.\n\n\u201cOur objective this year is developing a co-ordinated strategy around land mapping in the regions,\u201d Atkinson says.\n\nAtkinson says well created subdivisions lead to high value communities. Buyers know they will be sitting alongside neighbours who also want to care for their properties.\n\n\u201cGiven the shortage of land around Auckland, customers are typically paying $850-$900k for mainstream new build projects. There needs to be more attention to affordable solutions below that level, with land values being the key to affordable housing\u201d, Atkinson says.\n\nENDS\n\n\u00a9 Scoop Media", "article_metadata": {"description": "Top-10 national residential builder Generation Homes looking for freeing up of land in budget announcement", "title": "Generation Homes looking for freeing up of land in budget", "og": {"image": "http://img.scoop.co.nz/stories/images/1509/scoop_placeholder.jpg"}, "msvalidate.01": "D3EE7BEC171B22CC0004BCAD3AA9F55A", "section_key": "nzpolitics", "keywords": "Generation Homes, Politics, Budget, Housing, Real Estate, Scoop", "google-site-verification": "_g7_as_6L5G11kGq92K0w9zHzfUnAYXOUVCvYtF0evQ", "verify-v1": "DmDRtGvVBvw+iZevBiahLdYqjyp7GyLA1poTPET2uBg=", "y_key": "4091684479be8a25"}, "article_summary": "Generation Homes looking for freeing up of land in budgetMONDAY MAY 23Top-10 national residential builder Generation Homes looking for freeing up of land in budget announcementGeneration Homes chief executive Kevin Atkinson says unless the Government and councils act soon to increase land supply, the long held Kiwi dream of owning your own home will disappear.\nAs a top-10 national residential builder Generation Homes wants be part of the solution to Auckland home affordability issues.\nThe Generation Homes team have not been a passive onlookers to this problem.\nGeneration Homes uses a collaborative approach with landowners on what can be complex developments.\nSo holding a \u201cworking land supply\u201d has always been core to the high quality packages the building group offers."}
