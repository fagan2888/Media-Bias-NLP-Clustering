But it warned it will remain below pre-crisis levels for some time.\n\n\"(The) economy is on the right track, but we mustn't be fooled into thinking that it is back up to full strength just yet,\" said David Kern, chief economist at the BCC.\n\n\"The UK's current account deficit remains excessive, and without a stronger rebalancing towards net exports, we could face serious risks to our long-term economic health.\"\n\nHe also said businesses will only increase their capital if low inflation and low interest rates persist.\n\nThe BoE has stressed it is in no rush to raise interest rates. It has suggested spring of 2015 as a possibility for the first hike in interest rates which have been at a record low 0.5 percent for five years. Two BoE policymakers have said a rate hike could come sooner if inflation pressures pick up.\n\n\"Some MPC members seem to be signalling early interest rate rises,\" said Kern. \"This kind of unhelpful speculation will only prevent business from investing and put pressure on an already strong pound, which could put the recovery at risk.\"\n\n(Reporting by Andy Bruce; Editing by William Schomberg/Ruth Pitchford)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Reuters Editorial", "Author": "Reuters Editorial", "DCSext.PageNumber": 1, "twitter": {"description": "Britain's economy should exceed its pre-recession growth peak in the next few months, according to the British Chambers of Commerce, which on Monday upgraded its forecasts for this year and next.", "title": "UK economy to conquer pre-recession peak soon: business group", "image": "http://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20140310&t=2&i=858330446&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=CBREA2901X200", "creator": "@Reuters", "site": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "DCSext.rChannel": "Finance", "sailthru.tags": "US, BRITAIN, ECONOMY, BCC", "sailthru.title": "UK economy to conquer pre-recession peak soon: business group", "keywords": "US,BRITAIN,ECONOMY,BCC,Economic Output,United Kingdom,Western Europe,Economic Events,Europe,Business Sentiment,Economic Indicators,Government Borrowing Requirement", "DCSext.ContentType": "Article", "DCSext.ContentID_GCA-Economy2010": "USBREA2901A20140310", "news_keywords": "US;BRITAIN;ECONOMY;BCC;Economic Output;United Kingdom;Western Europe;Economic Events;Europe;Business Sentiment;Economic Indicators;Government Borrowing Requirement", "WT.cg_n": "Finance -
