Col. Nicholson in The Bridge on the River Kwai, \u201cWhat have I done?\u201d\n\nWriter Sheryl Gay Stolberg notes in this morning\u2019s NYT that \u201cWashington\u2019s health care revolving door is spinning fast as the new online health insurance marketplaces, a central provision of President Obama\u2019s health care law, are set to open Oct. 1. Those who had a hand in the law\u2019s passage are now finding lucrative work in the private sector, as businesses try to understand the complex measure, reshape it by pressing for regulatory changes\u2014or profit from it.\u201d\n\nStolberg describes \u201cboom times for what might be called an Obamacare cottage industry, providing work for dozens of former administration and mostly Democratic Congressional officials whose immersion in health policy minutiae, and friendships, make them invaluable to private business.\u201d\n\nWe see you\u2019ve been enjoying the content on our exclusive member website.

Earl Pomeroy, D-N.D., voted for the healthcare bill and lost his reelection bid, but don\u2019t cry for him: He now a lawyer for Alston & Bird representing healthcare clients.\n\nElizabeth Engel, who oversaw health legislation for HHS, now advises healthcare clients for the Glover Park Group.\n\nThe NYT\u2019s \u201carggh\u201d about all this: \u201cThe health care industry now spends more money on lobbying in Washington than any sector of the economy, according to the Center for Responsive Politics here. \u2026 Critics say these former officials are cashing in, trading on the relationships and expertise they acquired while working for the taxpayers, and cite such career moves as proof that Mr. Obama has not lived up to his promise to change the culture of influence peddling in the capital.\u201d\n\nIt does seem unethical to centralize power in D.C. and then stay at the center and cash in, but be not afraid: Reporter Stolberg, a journalistic anthropologist, tells us that \u201cthe progression from government to the private sector is also predictable, a window into the peculiar rhythms of life in the capital.\u201d\n\nThose rhythms are like mama birds feeding their babies: \u201cYoung aides, often fresh out of college or graduate school, acquire highly specialized knowledge but eventually settle down, build lives and long for jobs that pay more and let them see their children at night.\u201d Sweet.\n\nStolberg quotes James Thurber, director of the Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies at American University, calling all the activity \u201ca natural phenomenon.\u201d Candidate Barack Obama in 2008 criticized this natural phenomenon, aka \u201cinsider lobbying,\u201d and pledged to end it, but that was then and this is now.\n\nAnd here\u2019s the most vivid quotation in Stolberg\u2019s story: \u201cThe tentacles of Obamacare touch everybody\u2014health insurance companies, doctors, the payers,\u201d said Ivan Adler, a McCormick Group executive recruiter who specializes in Washington\u2019s K Street lobbying corridor.\n\nGood word: \u201ctentacles.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "WORLD", "description": "The New York Times on both its editorial and news pages pushes for more centralization of power in Washington, but sometimes even its reporters must step back", "title": "WORLD | The Times exposes Obamacare\u2019s tentacles | Marvin Olasky | Sept. 18, 2013", "url": "http://www.worldmag.com/2013/09/the_times_exposes_obamacare_s_tentacles", "image": "http://www.worldmag.com/media/images/content/dorahughes0917.jpg", "type": "article"}, "keywords": "world magazine, christian world news magazine, christian views, christian perspectives, god's world magazine", "description": "The New York Times on both its editorial and news pages pushes for more centralization of power in Washington, but sometimes even its reporters must step back"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1b59\"", "article_summary": "Former U.S. Rep.
