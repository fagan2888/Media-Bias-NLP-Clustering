The DOJ's Friday announcement about a compliance review caught Tomas Aguirre, dean of students, off guard.

"(I am) so disappointed I can't tell you," Aguirre said. "Especially after all the hard work by so many different people."

The DOJ said it received multiple complaints about how UNM handles sexual assault cases.

Eight cases have been reported this year. In 2013 there were 11 cases of sexual assault -- up from the four reported in 2012.

UNM implemented a number of new programs, including the expansion of the sexual molestation and assault response team.

"Within the last year and a half, this university has done everything that it possible could to address this terrible issue," Aguirre said.

Aguirre said the university can always do more to put an end to sexual violence on the campus.
