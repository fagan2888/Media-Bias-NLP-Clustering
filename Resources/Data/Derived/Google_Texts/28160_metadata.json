It's a real challenge.\u201d\n\nSlover pointed to Murino's concern as a reason that scrutiny of mergers in both the provider and insurer industries is required. \u201cIn those negotiations, we want the providers to have to negotiate with the insurers, but we also want the insurers to have to negotiate with the providers and we want each of them to have effective alternatives so that no one can really lay down a \u2018take it or leave it,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nHe described his concern that excessive consolidation on one side or the other would create a \u201cspiral where the providers are saying the insurers are too powerful, we need to get powerful too, and the insurers are saying the providers are getting more powerful, we need to get more powerful too.\u201d\n\nAccording to Slover, this arms race ends \u201cwith what has been long-referred to in antitrust circles as a \u2018sumo wrestler' situation\u201d in which two gigantic organizations bulk up to face off but then actually end up accommodating each other to the detriment of anyone outside of the circle, in this case, the consumers.\n\nConsider Remedies\n\nThe panelists agreed that potential merger partners should consider the possible remedies for anticompetitive effects that could flow from the proposed merger.\n\nFeinstein said that the most common remedy requested by the FTC when it discovers that a merger has an anticompetitive effect is that the merged entity divest some aspect of the business in order to reset the competitive balance.\n\n\u201cOften in hospital mergers we get promises that are proffered to us from the hospitals that they will simply agree to price caps, agree not to change their behavior, agree to increase prices only at the rate of inflation,\u201d she said.\n\nFeinstein added that \u201cthose are not remedies that the FTC finds acceptable\u201d because of the inability to \u201cguess\u201d what a proper price cap would look like and the near certainty that a price cap will lead to diminished quality of care.\n\nMurino agreed. \u201cThe thing I absolutely tell all of my clients is if you're going to be interested in doing any kind of consolidation the remedy must be structural.\u201d Conduct remedies that focus merely on promises not to raise prices or act in an anticompetitive way \u201care just not effective,\u201d she added.\n\nFeinstein said that many of the hospital mergers that are litigated reach that point because the type of structural divestiture that could be requested would undo the deal entirely.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Matthew Loughran in Washington at mloughran@bna.com\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Nancy Simmons at nsimmons@bna.com", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.bna.com/no-conflict-aca-n57982065178/", "image": "http://www.bna.com/uploadedImages/BNA_V2/Company/BnaSocialShare.jpg", "description": "There is no conflict between the coordination of care provisions of the Affordable Care Act and the antitrust laws that would excuse health-care providers engaging in anticompetitive mergers, Deborah Feinstein, director of the Federal Trade Commission's Bureau of Competition, told reporters at a briefing at the National Press Club Dec. 15.", "title": "No Conflict Between ACA and Antitrust, FTC Official Says"}, "csrf-token": "k0YT3FjVVbzxXu22jFQYJWU662OZvW-YKcwT7qIj6Y_8GcOxa1uhHa-UNwVm3jbB_QmmUleuz4z5SHZVw99N6J2blJhplCRSu-gqjwebIck1:QIu8omQcPoS0Lc2TvycL5Y5zTnbQ2D1jAxmmVsz6f0z4Pv25BeNw14y0zObGR5bFZ0gnKk8KBNXjUDQMjpbXvUgOeGwSD7F8SoV3sdCS3Pc1", "description": "There is no conflict between the coordination of care provisions of the Affordable Care Act and the antitrust laws that would excuse health-care providers engaging in anticompetitive mergers, Deborah Feinstein, director of the Federal Trade Commission's Bureau of Competition, told report", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fragment": "!"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThat suggests that there are in fact ways for folks to collaborate\u201d and \u201cnot run afoul of the antitrust laws,\u201d Feinstein said.\n\u201cIf you look at the ACA it specifically says it's not meant to supplant competition and we think it is quite clear that the goals of the ACA and antitrust are in harmony, not in conflict,\u201d she said.\nCoordination With ACOsOf the \u201chundreds of ACOs\u201d that exist, Feinstein said that none had ever been challenged by the antitrust authorities.\nFeinstein added that such a collaboration was illustrative of what could be done in areas such as population health management studies.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Matthew Loughran in Washington at mloughran@bna.comTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Nancy Simmons at nsimmons@bna.com"}
