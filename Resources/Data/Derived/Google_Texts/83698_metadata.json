The Billboard went up Aug. 3 and will stay up through July 31, 2016. (Photo: Nate Beck / Oshkosh Northwestern Media)Buy Photo\n\nOn Aug. 19, the Fond du Lac Reporter published an article about a billboard that appears along Interstate 41 in Oshkosh noting that the content of the sign is unusual for this stretch of highway. The billboard depicts Mount Rushmore, but not with images of our founding fathers. Instead, Mao Zedong, Adolph Hitler and Joseph Stalin are portrayed next to President Barack Obama. The tagline reads, \u201cMy real father\u2019s dream. Search it\u201d and invites passersby to visit the website InfoWars.com.\n\nThe General Council of the Congregation of Sisters of Saint Agnes has discussed the message conveyed by the billboard and finds it highly offensive. The First Amendment protects citizens\u2019 right to free speech, but this does not include the publication of untruths that harm a person or his/her reputation through ridicule, hatred, scorn or contempt. The sisters believe the billboard demeans the office of the presidency of the United States and the dignity of the president. In keeping with the U.S. Catholic Bishops\u2019 call to Faithful Citizenship, CSA believes it is a civic duty to respect the offices and office holders of our government.\n\nActing on this belief and in consonance with the Congregation\u2019s commitment to uphold human dignity of all people through ministries of education, healthcare and pastoral care, we invite others to oppose this type of advertisement. We invite you to speak with family and friends, write your legislators and use social media to support First Amendment rights without undermining the human dignity of those in public office.\n\nSisters Jean Steffes, Jomarie Zielke, Anita Henning, Susan Seeby\n\nFond du Lac\n\nRead or Share this story: http://fondul.ac/1Jk4bgm", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Sisters offended by \u201841\u2019 billboard", "og": {"site_name": "Action Reporter Media", "description": "Sisters offended by \u201841\u2019 billboard", "title": "Sisters offended by \u201841\u2019 billboard", "url": "http://www.fdlreporter.com/story/opinion/2015/08/25/sisters-offended-billboard/32336785/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/fdlreporter.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Sisters offended by \u201841\u2019 billboard", "title": "Sisters offended by \u201841\u2019 billboard", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3ccb5ba9793eeeb24a44294f14e4196f1dd12762/c=87-0-2535-2448&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/08/18/Oshkosh/B9318503728Z.1_20150818135701_000_GSJBLNAOO.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@fdlreporter", "site": "@fdlreporter", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=884281456", "fb": {"app_id": 175275349169565}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "Buy Photo A new ad along Interstate 41 likens President Obama to Joseph Stalin, Adolf Hitler and Mao Zedong.\nThe sisters believe the billboard demeans the office of the presidency of the United States and the dignity of the president.\nThe General Council of the Congregation of Sisters of Saint Agnes has discussed the message conveyed by the billboard and finds it highly offensive.\nInstead, Mao Zedong, Adolph Hitler and Joseph Stalin are portrayed next to President Barack Obama.\nSisters Jean Steffes, Jomarie Zielke, Anita Henning, Susan SeebyFond du LacRead or Share this story: http://fondul.ac/1Jk4bgm"}
