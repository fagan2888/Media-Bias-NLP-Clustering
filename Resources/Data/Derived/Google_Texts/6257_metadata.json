I\u2019m running to build an alternative outside of the corporate parties that puts people before corporate profits.\u201d\n\n\u201cDonna Edwards ran on a progressive platform and she has not delivered,\u201d Flowers said. \u201cShe has not shown that she is willing to stand up to the moneyed interests in the Democratic Party and fight for the interests of people.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn her email blasts that she sends out, it\u2019s all about her personality and not about the issues,\u201d Flowers said. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2014 let\u2019s put a woman in this position.\u201d\n\n\u201cVan Hollen is the former head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and very much tied into Wall Street,\u201d Flowers said.\n\nWhen asked why she would run against relatively progressive Democratic members of Congress, Flowers says that \u201cit\u2019s about how the Democratic Party controls its members.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen they have something politically toxic like fast track, they pass with the exact number of votes they need, and that allows some members of Congress to be able to take a position that looks good \u2014 like Donna Edwards coming out against fast track and the Trans Pacific Trade Agreement (TPP).\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if she is doing that because she is against it, or because she knew she would be running for Senate and didn\u2019t want to have that on her record.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to be beholden to either corporate party and I will not make my decision based on whether I\u2019m running for office again. I\u2019ll make my decision based on meeting the needs of the majority of people. I\u2019ll be in there fighting based on those principles \u2014 not based on my political career.\u201d\n\nEdwards is one of 53 members of the House of Representatives who is a co-sponsor of HR 676 \u2014 the single payer bill in the House. Van Hollen is not a co-sponsor.\n\n\u201cWhen Donna initially ran for Congress, she ran on a platform of supporting single payer,\u201d Flowers said. \u201cBut then when 2009 and 2010 came around, she wasn\u2019t talking about single payer. I went to her town hall meetings. I sat next to her at one of them. And I asked her \u2014 why aren\u2019t you talking about single payer? And she wouldn\u2019t respond. And she got up and gave all of the talking points that the Democrats were giving to support the ACA (Affordable Care Act).\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was extremely disappointing. I had a run-in with her toward the end of that whole process \u2014 before the final vote,\u201d Flowers said. \u201cThis was before Dennis Kucinich had yet to come out in support of ACA. We were looking for a small group of Democrats who would have the courage to stand together and say \u2014 this is the wrong solution. The ACA was a complete bailout for the private insurance industry. I had a run-in with her and I asked her if she would stand up with a few other members of the Progressive Caucus. And she wouldn\u2019t and she got pretty angry with me for just asking the question.\u201d\n\nBernie Sanders is the only Senator who has introduced single payer legislation in the Senate.\n\nFlowers says she is glad to see that Sanders is speaking out for single payer.\n\nBut she says it would have been better had Sanders introduced a Senate version of HR 676.\n\nInstead, he introduced his own bill \u2014 a state-based system that doesn\u2019t cover everyone in the country and that protects for-profit hospitals and other institutions.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t have a real health system that improves health outcomes unless you include everybody who is living in the country,\u201d Flowers says. \u201cInfectious diseases don\u2019t know any boundaries. You want people to seek care when they need it so we can prevent infectious epidemics. The Sanders legislation allows the states to determine who qualifies.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe other problem with the Sanders legislation is that research shows pretty clearly that for-profit health providers cost more money and have worse outcomes. HR 676 would buy out those for-profit institutions and the Sanders legislation allows those to continue.\u201d\n\nWhy did Sanders go his own way? Why didn\u2019t he just introduce the equivalent of HR 676 in the Senate?\n\n\u201cI can only speculate,\u201d Flowers said. \u201cI know that Sanders is pretty close to many unions. He gets a lot of his funding from unions. I would have to get you a document that I saw a number of years ago. It shows that National Nurses United (NNU) and SEIU made some sort of a deal where NNU would support legislation that would allow for-profit institutions to continue and in return, SEIU would allow NNU to organize certain populations of healthcare employees. I can find that for you. But again, that\u2019s speculation. I don\u2019t know why Sanders didn\u2019t introduce the equivalent of HR 676 in the Senate.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t you like Sanders run for the presidency and don\u2019t you hope he wins the nomination?\n\n\u201cNo I don\u2019t,\u201d Flowers says. \u201cI like some of what he is saying. I have disagreements with him on his foreign policy. It\u2019s a double edged sword. It\u2019s great that he is saying these things about wealth inequality, which he has always said, reaching an audience that hasn\u2019t been reached yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut we\u2019ve seen this before \u2014 where insurgent Democrats speak to the issues of the time in order to keep people within the corrupt Democratic Party. Those people are ready to leave to go to an alternative party, but they hear this great rhetoric coming from the Democrats and they think \u2014 oh, they can be reformed, they can be changed. And then in the end, when Sanders loses the nomination, he\u2019ll endorse Joe Biden or Hillary Clinton and that energy will be funnelled back into the Democratic Party. It maintains the status quo.\u201d\n\nWhat if Sanders wins the nomination?\n\n\u201cThat would be interesting. But I don\u2019t think that is really possible in the current way that the Democratic Party is structured with the super delegates and the number of primaries they have early in the year next year.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut if he wins, he still has serious problems on foreign policy. He\u2019s a strong supporter of Israel. He will continue to be aggressive toward Russia, which is not the right solution. He supports the building of the F-35, which is built in Vermont. Even the Pentagon says they don\u2019t need it anymore, it wasn\u2019t worth building and Congress funded it anyway. He looks toward military solutions. We need to shrink our empire, be a bit more diplomatic, rather than being so aggressive in our foreign policy. I don\u2019t have faith that he would do that. That\u2019s where I differ with him on foreign policy.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf Sanders were to be President, he may do some things that are better than other Democrats like Obama, but I don\u2019t know that we would have the fundamental shift in our government that we need to meet people\u2019s needs.\u201d\n\nWhere is the single payer movement heading?\n\n\u201cThings are starting to change,\u201d Flowers says. \u201cThere was an initial deflation after the ACA passed. There was so much propaganda. The Democrats were saying \u2014 we did it, we passed healthcare reform and now our problems are solved. That created conflict within the single payer movement. You had people who saw that more people had insurance and they didn\u2019t want to be seen as going against that.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow that we are this far out and the exchanges have been up and running, people are seeing that the premiums continue to rise. I had an accountant tell me that 100 percent of her clients had to pay back all or part of their subsidies.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe coverage is still very shoddy, with high deductibles and narrow networks. It\u2019s still makes it difficult for patients to get the care and medications they need. You are starting to see the single payer movement trying to ramp up again. There has been really good work done to build a strong medical student corps. We now have hundreds of medical students holding their own conferences. They are doing national days of action \u2014 one is being held today.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s starting to surface again. And it\u2019s going to be part of the broader struggle for social, economic and environmental justice. We need a strong leader \u2014 which is something we lacked in Congressman John Conyers in 2009 and 2010. We needed someone out there saying \u2014 let\u2019s do this, let\u2019s get this through. Someone who would fight for it.\u201d\n\nConyers was not a strong leader?\n\n\u201cHe was conflicted,\u201d Flowers said. \u201cHe liked Obama. He was excited to have an African American President. He was being pressured to toe the line with the rest of the Democrats and not go against the President. He would speak about single payer in public, but he was not willing to fight for it inside of Congress and make it part of the agenda.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "generator": "WordPress 3.8.14"}, "article_summary": "Single payer activist Dr. Margaret Flowers is running as a Green Party candidate for the U.S. Senate seat in Maryland.\n\u201cWhen Donna initially ran for Congress, she ran on a platform of supporting single payer,\u201d Flowers said.\n\u201cBut then when 2009 and 2010 came around, she wasn\u2019t talking about single payer.\nYou are starting to see the single payer movement trying to ramp up again.\nHe would speak about single payer in public, but he was not willing to fight for it inside of Congress and make it part of the agenda.\u201d"}
