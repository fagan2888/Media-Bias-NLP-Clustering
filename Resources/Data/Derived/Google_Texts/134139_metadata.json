HCSM monthly fees, or \u201cshares,\u201d cost about $200 per person and up to $500 per family, enabling members to submit most of their health care costs for reimbursement by other members.\n\nSaving $5,200 per Year\n\nDr. Brian Forrest, CEO and Network Manager of Access Healthcare Direct in Apex, North Carolina, says 10 percent of the 3,500 patients at his three-physician DPC practice are members of the HCSMs Medi-Share and Samaritan Ministries, and Forrest says up to 2 percent are enrolled in Liberty Direct (LD), a plan offered by the HCSM Liberty Healthshare.\n\nForrest says dual membership in his DPC and LD would satisfy the Affordable Care Act\u2019s (ACA) individual health insurance mandate and cover monthly DPC membership fees.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s say we have a 55-year-old-patient that pays Liberty Direct $199 per month,\u201d Forrest said. \u201cThis will qualify him in terms of not paying the ACA penalty, which could be double the amount of the yearly cost for the LD plan. Also, LD pays 100 percent of his membership fee for our practice out of the $199 per month. This means he would have little if any costs at all to come to our practice.\u201d\n\nForrest says this patient\u2019s dual membership in a DPC and LD would cost thousands of dollars less per year than the combined cost of a Bronze ACA plan premium and deductible.\n\n\u201cSince we charge between $45 and $59 per month normally, that means he is saving about 60 percent on his monthly premium costs compared to the Bronze ACA plan\u2014the cheapest available to him\u2014and up to 100 percent of our costs,\u201d Forrest said. \u201cThis could save this patient a total of $5,200 per year in out-of-pocket costs. That does not even take into account that his deductible amount, which was $6,300, is now limited to $500 per year [in] out-of-pocket [expenses] prior to the \u2018expense sharing\u2019 funding his care.\u201d\n\nIncreasing Value, Options\n\nDr. Michael Stevenson, owner and founder of Direct Access Family Care\u2014located in Poplar Bluff, Missouri\u2014says he started encouraging DPC patients to combine their DPC membership with an LD membership in December 2015 to increase value and options for patients.\n\n\u201cWe started this process to add value to the membership and to provide another alternative in our community,\u201d Stevenson said. \u201cMany people are just frustrated with the high cost of insurance, only to find out they still have no coverage except for a major medical event where they would be required to meet a high deductible.\u201d\n\nStevenson said the 200 individuals in his 1,200-patient practice who are enrolled in LD \u201ccan save between $492 and $720 per year by using Liberty Direct.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy main mission is to get information out to the community that Liberty Direct is available and a common-sense, responsible financial solution for providing good health care,\u201d Stevenson said.\n\nJenni White (jenni@rope2.org) writes from Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.", "article_metadata": {}, "article_summary": "Some direct primary care (DPC) providers are recommending patients combine their DPC membership with membership in a health care sharing ministry (HCSM) to increase savings and coverage for their health care needs.\n\u201cLet\u2019s say we have a 55-year-old-patient that pays Liberty Direct $199 per month,\u201d Forrest said.\nHCSM monthly fees, or \u201cshares,\u201d cost about $200 per person and up to $500 per family, enabling members to submit most of their health care costs for reimbursement by other members.\nForrest says dual membership in his DPC and LD would satisfy the Affordable Care Act\u2019s (ACA) individual health insurance mandate and cover monthly DPC membership fees.\nDPC memberships are private doctor-patient agreements offering a range of preventive care services in exchange for a monthly fee of approximately $50 to $100 per person."}
