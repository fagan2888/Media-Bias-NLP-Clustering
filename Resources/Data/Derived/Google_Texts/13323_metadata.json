That was when Eleanor decided who her candidate would be \u2013 and when she heard Clinton was coming to Norfolk, insisted on coming to see.\n\nIn a fiery half hour speech, Clinton made her bid to be the first woman president, appealing to Virginians for support in Tuesday's primary.\n\nRepublicans, she said, \"don't believe in raising the minimum wage, they don't believe in equal pay \u2013 they believe we should go back to the failed snake-oil policy of trickle-down economics.\"\n\nVideo: Hillary Clinton in Norfolk Presidential Candidate Hillary Clinton visit Lake Taylor High School in Norfolk.

Clean energy, she said, would generate millions of jobs for Americans.\n\nClinton also promised to protect the Affordable Care Act, saying that while Republicans in Congress have voted more than 60 times to repeal it, \"they won't even tell you what they will put in its place, because they know you won't like it.\"\n\nClinton at Lake Taylor Aileen Devlin / Daily Press Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton speaks to the crowd at Lake Taylor High School in Norfolk on Monday, Feb. 29, 2016.

No Mags, No Sales, No Internet, No TV (Aileen Devlin / Daily Press)\n\nThe former first lady contrasted her stands on guns and on higher education with those of her competitor for the Democratic nomination, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.\n\nShes said Sanders voted for immunity for gun makers and dealers against lawsuits seeking damages while she opposed it during her time as a senator from New York.\n\nAnd while detailing a proposal to refinance student debt and reduce the burden of college on families, she said Sanders' proposal for free education at public universities was unrealistic and would mean middle class taxpayers would subsidize education for the wealthy.\n\nFor the 1,500 at the rally, the idea that brought Smith and O'Reilly and their 6-year-olds \u2013 that it is past time for a woman president \u2013 resonated strongly.\n\n\"It's a question of equity,\" said Mordecai L. Smith, no relation to Jennifer. He said Clinton's promises to do better by vets and to keep steering the course on criminal justice and foreign policy that President Barack Obama has set had won him over.\n\n\"My heart's with Bernie, but my head's with Hillary,\" said William Massie, of Virginia Beach. For him, electability was the deciding issue.\n\nIt was Clinton's last stop before Super Tuesday, when Democrats from Virginia to American Samoa will vote on who they want the party's nominee to be.\n\nClinton started the day in Massachusetts, where Sanders is pressing hard, and stopped in vote-rich Northern Virginia before heading over to Lake Taylor High School.\n\nClinton has a strong lead in the polls in most Super Tuesday states, but political scientists believe if Sanders can win at least 40 percent of Virginia's vote, it will signal a long battle for the party's nomination.\n\nRess can be reached by telephone at 757-247-4535.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Clinton fires up Hampton Roads crowd in final pre-Super Tuesday rally", "date": "2016-02-29", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Daily Press", "author": "Daily Press", "og": {"site_name": "dailypress.com", "description": "NORFOLK \u2014 It was a 6-year-old's question during the Presidents' Run at a Nationals baseball game in Washington that brought Jennifer Smith, her daughter Eleanor and their friends to Hillary Clinton's final pre-Super Tuesday rally at Lake Taylor High School.", "title": "Clinton fires up Hampton Roads crowd in final pre-Super Tuesday rally", "url": "http://www.dailypress.com/news/politics/dp-nws-clinton-20160229-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56d503e0/turbine/dp-nws-clinton-20160229", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp03.15", "twitter": {"site": "@daily_press", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=397500600, app-argument=http://www.dailypress.com/deeplinkid/86066292", "fb": {"page_id": 140388628320, "app_id": 515474311837346}, "googlebot-news": "index", "keywords": "Hillar Clinton, Democratic presidential nomination", "news_keywords": "Hillar Clinton, Democratic presidential nomination", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "Description": "Democratic Presidental hopeful Hillary Clinton makes final pre-Super Tuesday stop at a high spirited Norfolk rally"}, "article_summary": "Video: Hillary Clinton in Norfolk Presidential Candidate Hillary Clinton visit Lake Taylor High School in Norfolk.\nClinton at Lake Taylor Aileen Devlin / Daily Press Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton speaks to the crowd at Lake Taylor High School in Norfolk on Monday, Feb. 29, 2016.\nPresidential Candidate Hillary Clinton visit Lake Taylor High School in Norfolk.\nClinton started the day in Massachusetts, where Sanders is pressing hard, and stopped in vote-rich Northern Virginia before heading over to Lake Taylor High School.\nNo Mags, No Sales, No Internet, No TV Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton speaks to the crowd at Lake Taylor High School in Norfolk on Monday, Feb. 29, 2016."}
