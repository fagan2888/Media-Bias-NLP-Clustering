(Photo: David Coates / The Detroit News)Buy Photo\n\nThe UAW and FCA US, or Fiat Chrysler, reached a new tentative agreement following their failed first contract voted down by about 65 percent of the membership several weeks ago.\n\nBut the elements of the new deal that might appeal to the UAW rank and file also make the contract dangerous for the future of Detroit\u2019s automotive industry.\n\nThe UAW has pushed for higher wages, as well as equal pay regardless of worker seniority. It achieved both with the tentative contract. Senior workers would see their first pay increase in almost a decade, and second-tier, now called \u201cin-progression\u201d workers, would see a gradual pay increase of more than $10 an hour over eight years.\n\nThat\u2019s quite a gain, especially considering what a fragile state the U.S. automotive industry was recently in. Taxpayers might rightly wonder if their bail out of Chrysler and General Motors just seven years ago was for naught if automakers are once again making larger-than-life promises.\n\nIt\u2019s been a profitable year for Detroit\u2019s Big Three, and pressure to compensate accordingly is likely driving Fiat Chrysler\u2019s CEO Sergio Marchionne to offer such pay increases. But a contract negotiated during good times doesn\u2019t take into account that in the auto industry, good times can wane quickly.\n\nThe proposed deal would add between $500 million and $600 million to FCA\u2019s annual costs.\n\nThat\u2019s quite a bit, however, some industry experts argue since labor costs are a small percentage of automakers\u2019 overall operating costs, it won\u2019t make much of a dent.\n\nUAW labor accounts for 8 percent of Ford\u2019s total costs, 6 to 7 percent at GM, and just 4 percent at FCA, according to the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor.\n\nBut the auto industry typically competes over razor-thin profit margins, and in that light, Marchionne\u2019s concessions seem reckless.\n\nGiven FCA\u2019s precarious financial situation, it\u2019s possible this is Marchionne\u2019s way of pushing a merger with GM, which he has suggested several times this year.\n\nStill, Chrysler\u2019s relatively large number of formerly-so-called second-tier workers was its huge competitive advantage over GM and Ford, even over foreign automakers, and has kept the company alive.\n\nThat and consumers\u2019 penchant for SUVs and other gas-guzzling vehicles, courtesy of this year\u2019s anomalously low fuel prices. If FCA continues to rely on profits from its popular Jeep models \u2014 some of the only vehicles that will continue to be made in the U.S. \u2014 it could face huge problems when gas prices inevitably rise and demand slows.\n\nWhich brings to light another noticeable void in the proposed deal: new jobs. New employment opportunities at a few Chrysler plants are offset by potential reductions at others, and the company still plans to move small car production to Mexico.\n\nHealth care and other benefits remain untouched, and politically the UAW has covered itself by banking on substantial changes to the Affordable Care Act and the feared Cadillac tax on premium health care plans under a new administration in Washington.\n\nRegardless, workers at GM and Ford shouldn\u2019t necessarily expect such a generous pay structure, some industry insiders say. Of course, UAW Vice President Jimmy Settles has told workers to expect an even better deal from at least Ford.\n\nThe real question the UAW should be concerned with is whether their pay increases are going to force even more production \u2014 and therefore, jobs \u2014 out of the country. And what success means if they work for a company that is once again bankrupt in a few years.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://detne.ws/1LuNlxE", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Tentative deal between Chrysler and UAW offers generous pay, but little new production, few new jobs", "og": {"site_name": "Detroit News", "description": "Tentative deal between Chrysler and UAW offers generous pay, but little new production, few new jobs", "title": "Our Editorial: UAW\u2019s jobs for pay tradeoff", "url": "http://www.detroitnews.com/story/opinion/editorials/2015/10/14/editorial-uaw-jobs-pay-tradeoff/73961956/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/detroitnews.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Tentative deal between Chrysler and UAW offers generous pay, but little new production, few new jobs", "title": "Our Editorial: UAW\u2019s jobs for pay tradeoff", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4438a924d83d14234d0dd4fa48762a8c70f4a131/c=371-0-2409-2038&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/10/14/DetroitNews/B99313051Z.1_20151014204235_000_GU5K3N92.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@detroitnews", "site": "@detroitnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=904391631", "fb": {"app_id": 175422022549521}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "Regardless, workers at GM and Ford shouldn\u2019t necessarily expect such a generous pay structure, some industry insiders say.\nThe real question the UAW should be concerned with is whether their pay increases are going to force even more production \u2014 and therefore, jobs \u2014 out of the country.\nThe UAW has pushed for higher wages, as well as equal pay regardless of worker seniority.\nSenior workers would see their first pay increase in almost a decade, and second-tier, now called \u201cin-progression\u201d workers, would see a gradual pay increase of more than $10 an hour over eight years.\nBut a contract negotiated during good times doesn\u2019t take into account that in the auto industry, good times can wane quickly."}
