As news of Robin Williams’ death reverberates across the country, elected officials are lending their voices to the national outpouring of sympathy and grief.

In a statement late Monday, President Barack Obama called Williams “one of-a-kind” and extended “condolences to Robin’s family, his friends, and everyone who found their voice and their verse thanks to Robin Williams.”

Secretary of State John Kerry described Williams both as a “huge creative genius” and a “caring, involved citizen.”

“I’ll always be grateful for his personal friendship,” Kerry said.

Minority leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif) also expressed her sadness at Williams’ passing with the following tweet:

The world has lost a great genius and San Francisco has lost a loyal friend. http://t.co/J2Bkr715Ne — Nancy Pelosi (@NancyPelosi) August 12, 2014

Pentagon Press Secretary Rear. Adm. John Kirby tweeted this advice from Williams:

I once asked Robin Williams to offer advice for my son, who would soon turn 18. "Follow your heart," he said. "The head is sometimes wrong." — Rear Adm. John Kirby (@PentagonPresSec) August 12, 2014

Paying tribute to Williams’ extraterrestrial role in TV sitcom Mork and Mindy, Rep. Jared Polis (D-Colo) dressed up as the alien Mork and visited Mork and Mindy’s house in Boulder, Colorado. The house is in Polis’s district.
