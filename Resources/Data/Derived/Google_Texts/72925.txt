A Fort Bragg soldier was shot in the chest Friday morning after his wife mistook him for an intruder while he was trying to surprise her with breakfast in bed.

Fayetteville, North Carolina, police said Zia Segule, 28, left for work just after 10 a.m. Friday only to return later to surprise his wife, 27-year-old Tiffany Segule, with breakfast in bed, Raw Story reported.

Mr. Segule had apparently set off the home’s security alarm, and Mrs. Segule, believing he was an intruder, fired a gun through the closed bedroom door, shooting her husband in the chest, a local ABC affiliate reported.

“She was doing what she felt was right and to defend herself at that time,” said Det. Antoine Kincade, a spokesman with the Fayetteville Police Department.

Mr. Segule was released from Cape Fear Valley Medical Center Friday afternoon, telling media: “I’m good.”

Mrs. Segule was taken to the Fayetteville Police Department for questioning. Police said she may have been on edge due to recent break-ins in the area. An investigation is ongoing, the ABC affiliate reported.

“I can’t believe it just happened, but I understand,” neighbor Jose Estrella told the station. “I understand why it happened. Even at night, I wake up at night and say ‘OK, did I just hear something?’ But I wouldn’t open fire just like that.”

“Until you’re in that position, none of us can really say what we’re going to do,” said Debbie Lauterbach, another neighbor.
