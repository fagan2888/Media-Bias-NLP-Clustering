Authorities were notified by a man standing on the beach who saw a fireball over the ocean after seeing the helicopters flying in that area, Carr said at a news conference.\n\n(Additional reporting by Alex Dobuzinskis in Los Angeles, Jon Herskovitz in Texas, and Susan Heavey, David Alexander and Laila Kearney in New York; Editing by Toni Reinhold, Lisa Shumaker and Kim Coghill)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "HONOLULU - High waves expected for the next several days will hamper the search for 12", "title": "High waves hamper search for Marines missing in Hawaii helicopter crash", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/01/15/High-waves-hamper-search-Marines-missing-Hawaii-helicopter-crash", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/hawaii-marines-crash_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/01/15/High-waves-hamper-search-Marines-missing-Hawaii-helicopter-crash", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/hawaii-marines-crash_2.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "HONOLULU - High waves expected for the next several days will hamper the search for 12", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Two Coast Guard cutters and several Coast Guard aircraft were searching, along with two U.S. Navy warships and local police and fire department helicopters, the Coast Guard said.\nHONOLULU - High waves expected for the next several days will hamper the search for 12 Marines missing at sea after two helicopters collided near the island of Oahu in Hawaii, U.S. Coast Guard officials said on Friday.\nThe debris field spanned more than 7 miles off the coast, the Coast Guard said.\n\"We've seen debris through the entire area,\" said Lieutenant Scott Carr, a Coast Guard spokesman.\nThe wide-ranging search for the Marines was hampered by high surf and poor visibility from rain storms."}
