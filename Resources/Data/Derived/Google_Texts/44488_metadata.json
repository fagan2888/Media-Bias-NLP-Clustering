In light of the federal government\u2019s failure to successfully launch its website, www.HealthCare.gov, to implement the Act, it is useful to step back and broadly assess government\u2019s efforts to implement and manage large projects.\n\nIn my testimony, I first discuss the conceptual justification for the government taking on large projects and what its objective should be. I then provide an overview of the available empirical evidence on the economic effects of government\u2019s management of a range of projects and offer possible explanations for the findings. I conclude by drawing some implications that pertain to the government\u2019s delay in launching the ACA website.\n\nTheory\n\nTwo reasons exist to justify government implementation of large projects. The first is to correct a market failure, which could arise when a socially desirable service (that is, one whose social benefits exceed social costs) is not privately offered because it is unprofitable or requires enormous financial capital that may be unavailable in private markets. Public bus transit systems are often alleged as an example of the former and the interstate highway system is alleged as an example of the latter. Market failure also occurs when a service is undersupplied because it is a public good and susceptible to the free rider problem. National defense is a classic example of a pure public good. Innovative activity by firms may also result in free riders by creating positive spillovers to competitors.\n\nThe government can increase the nation\u2019s welfare by financing socially desirable projects and services, including public goods, which would not be supplied by the private sector. In practice, the government can provide the service or negotiate a contract with a private firm to provide the service. In the ideal case, the government corrects a market failure and maximizes economic efficiency by setting efficient user charges, financing investments that equate marginal benefits and marginal costs, and minimizing production costs. Note that the projects and services requiring the largest investments constitute the nation\u2019s physical infrastructure. Government has tried to spur innovation in several ways, including the establishment of a patent system and an array of subsidies for firms.\n\nThe second reason that could justify government implementation of large projects is to pursue social goals\u2014that is, American society, like any society, seeks to solve other social problems in addition to correcting market failures and promoting economic efficiency. Those goals can be categorized broadly as attempting to reduce poverty, ensure fairness in labor markets, and provide merit goods\u2014goods that American society believes every citizen is entitled to regardless of whether he or she can afford them, including an education, insurance against certain events that could dramatically lower the quality of life (social insurance), and protection from criminals, hostile countries and terrorists, and natural disasters.\n\nGenerally, policies to achieve those goals redistribute resources from one group of people for the benefit of another group of people, but government should nonetheless attempt to achieve those goals at minimum cost to society. The ACA arguably tries to provide a merit good and to some extent correct a market failure.\n\nEvidence\n\nWhat does the empirical evidence indicate about government\u2019s involvement in projects and services to correct market failures and achieve social goals? My 2006 Brookings book, Government Failure Versus Market Failure, indicated government\u2019s efforts generally resulted in substantial losses in economic efficiency and missed opportunities to benefit society in a cost-efficient manner. Here I provide a brief overview and update of my findings.\n\nThe federal government, sometimes in collaboration with state and local governments, is responsible for financing and managing highways, airports, air traffic control, inland waterways, urban transit, and intercity passenger rail. In the appendix, I present a table that summarizes the economic inefficiencies and annual welfare costs from public provision of infrastructure and urban transit that appeared in my Journal of Economic Literature, September 2013 survey of the performance of the US transportation system. The total annual cost of the economic efficiencies exceeds $100 billion. The inefficiencies are attributable to the fact that government\u2019s provision and management of transportation services has not been guided by economic principles: prices do not reflect social marginal costs, especially a user\u2019s contribution to congestion and delays; investments are not based on cost-benefit analysis and on accurate forecasts of costs and benefits and have therefore failed to maximize net benefits; and operating costs are significantly inflated by regulations.\n\nThe vast inefficiencies have important implications for transportation-related policies to strengthen the economy. For example, the stimulus program and ongoing calls to increase infrastructure spending must recognize that potential improvements in the nation\u2019s productivity and employment are lessened by policy failures in the current transportation system. Similarly, the Obama administration\u2019s vision of a high-speed passenger rail network as a transformative investment must consider costs and benefits that have traditionally been overlooked by government. Indeed, Edward Glaeser performed a series of cost-benefit calculations that were published in his 2009 New York Times column and consistently found that building such a network would not be socially desirable.\n\nThe evidence that I report in Government Failure casts strong doubt on whether federal programs to spur innovation have supported socially beneficial programs that would have been undertaken without federal assistance. Moreover, some federal support has resulted in no accomplishments and cost taxpayers billions. The recent Solyndra fiasco harkens back to the Clinton administration\u2019s failed effort to produce a high-gas-mileage car using a hybrid propulsion system.\n\nStill other large-scale government projects and services have experienced serious problems including the U.S. postal system and the government\u2019s allocation and management of public land for grazing, natural conservation, and recreational activities. The former has continued to struggle financially, with ongoing threats to discontinue Saturday service, and the latter has come under attack after the government shutdown forced national parks to close.\n\nFinally, although I am much less familiar with empirical assessments of government services and programs to pursue social goals, such services and programs are undoubtedly not being provided at minimum social cost and are wasting a vast amount of resources.\n\nExplaining Government Failure\n\nAgency limitations, regulatory constraints, and political forces combine to cause and maintain inefficient policies and to impede efficient reforms. For example, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is at the heart of airport and air traffic control inefficiencies because it lacks organizational independence and is prevented to a significant extent by both the U.S. Department of Transportation and Congress from using its resources\u2014and from encouraging airports to use theirs\u2014more efficiently. Given that it faces opposition from two powerful branches of government, it is not surprising that the FAA finds it so difficult to reform its policies.\n\nGovernment agencies do little to assess whether their vast public expenditures have been spent efficiently. Transportation officials have told the GAO (GAO-05-172) that little incentive exists for them to direct available funding to performing outcome evaluations, but they have also said that potential risks do exist from finding out that a project is not providing the intended benefits. Thus, because government measures inputs instead of outputs in many venues, transportation agencies tend to declare that a project is a success once it is operating.\n\nAgencies are likely to have status quo bias because they may lack the technical expertise to ensure that new technologies are implemented effectively and efficiently. For example, the Federal Highway Administration has not placed a priority on using advances in information technology to improve highway travel. At the same time, FAA\u2019s well-publicized delays in implementing new technology have tarnished its reputation to manage air traffic control effectively.\n\nOf course, special interest politics is transparent in several areas of policy. In transportation, state and local government officials lobby for increased federal assistance for surface transportation grants and increased flexibility on how they use those funds; the American Automobile Association and the American Trucking Association have opposed efficient congestion tolls and axle-weight charges; labor unions have opposed removing Davis-Bacon regulations; and urban transit subsidies have largely been accrued by powerful interests\u2014higher wages to labor and higher profits to suppliers of transit capital. Finally, powerful interest groups are supporting federal funding of a national high-speed rail system.\n\nImplications for ACA Website\n\nThe potential for government failure in implementing and managing a large project should be foremost in the mind of the officials of a government agency and department when it takes responsibility for a new project. Accordingly, it is vital for those officials to take steps to anticipate and address potential failure. Based on my preceding discussion, the potential problems facing the government\u2019s launching of the ACA website include but are not limited to:\n\nLimited technical expertise and an over-reliance on contractors;\n\nLittle, if any, rigorous and transparent ongoing assessment because of a fear of exposing problems;\n\nStatus-quo bias and an inflexibility and inability to make important changes in managing a project;\n\nConstraints that may affect budgeting and adoption of state-of-the-art technology.\n\nThe unfortunate result of the functionality problems and delay in launching the federal ACA website is not that the desirability of the social goal of universal coverage is necessarily reduced\u2014the pursuit of that goal is a democratic decision that must be determined by our political system\u2014but that the social costs of achieving this goal are already, and will continue to be, inflated. Indeed, it is my understanding that some states that produced effective ACA websites have also negotiated lower rates with insurance companies for their consumers as compared with the rates obtained by states that are using the federal website and thus did not benefit from rate negotiations. It is also possible that a state that did not produce its own website could reduce the future efficiency costs of using the federal website by arranging to pay a fee to a state that produced an effective ACA enrollment website to expand that website so people from a different state could also use its services to sign up for their insurance.\n\nIn sum, the controversy surrounding the Act should not blind policymakers to their obligation to implement the Act at minimum social costs and, if necessary, to explore alternative ways of doing so.\n\nAppendix\n\nInefficiencies from the Public Provision of Infrastructure and Urban Transit", "article_metadata": {"description": "Looking at the Affordable Care Act's embattled website HealthCare.gov, Cliff Winston offers a broad assessment of the federal government's justification for taking on large-scale public&nbsp;projects by providing an overview of the economic effects of the government's management of a range of services.", "title": "Government Implementation of Large-Scale Projects: Government Failure, Its Sources, and Implications for the ACA Website Launch", "og": {"site_name": "The Brookings Institution", "description": "Looking at the Affordable Care Act's embattled website HealthCare.gov, Cliff Winston offers a broad assessment of the federal government's justification for taking on large-scale public&nbsp;projects by providing an overview of the economic effects of the government's management of a range of services.", "title": "Government Implementation of Large-Scale Projects: Government Failure, Its Sources, and Implications for the ACA Website Launch", "url": "http://www.brookings.edu/research/testimony/2013/12/04-government-implementation-large-scale-projects-winston", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/images/h/ha%20he/healthcaredotgov001/healthcaredotgov001_16x9.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 360}, "locale": "en", "type": "article", "determiner": "auto"}, "twitter": {"description": "Looking at the Affordable Care Act's embattled website HealthCare.gov, Cliff Winston offers a broad assessment of the federal government's justification for taking on large-scale public&nbsp;projects by providing an overview of the economic effects of the government's management of a range of services.", "title": "Government Implementation of Large-Scale Projects: Government Failure, Its Sources, and Implications for the ACA Website Launch", "image": {"width": 560, "identifier": "http://www.brookings.edu//~/media/research/images/h/ha%20he/healthcaredotgov001/healthcaredotgov001_16x9.jpg?w=560", "height": 315}, "site": {"identifier": "BrookingsInst", "id": 151106990}, "card": "summary_large_image", "account_id": 151106990}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 137459917707}, "ces": {"broadcontenttype": "Commentary ; Testimony", "programs": "Economic Studies", "topics": "Health ; Economics ; Fiscal Policy ; U.S. Government ; The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ; U.S. Economic Performance", "topicsbroad": "Health ; Economics ; Fiscal Policy ; U.S. Government", "experts": "Clifford Winston", "authors": "Clifford Winston", "contentdate": "2013/12/04 09:30:00", "title": "Government Implementation of Large-Scale Projects: Government Failure, Its Sources, and Implications for the ACA Website Launch", "researchactivities": "Economic Studies", "topicsspecialized": "The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ; U.S. Economic Performance"}, "article": {"section": "Testimony", "tag": "U.S. Government", "published_time": "2013-12-04", "modified_time": "2013-12-10", "author": "Clifford Winston"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdeee5\"", "article_summary": "In light of the federal government\u2019s failure to successfully launch its website, www.HealthCare.gov, to implement the Act, it is useful to step back and broadly assess government\u2019s efforts to implement and manage large projects.\nI conclude by drawing some implications that pertain to the government\u2019s delay in launching the ACA website.\nEvidenceWhat does the empirical evidence indicate about government\u2019s involvement in projects and services to correct market failures and achieve social goals?\nIn sum, the controversy surrounding the Act should not blind policymakers to their obligation to implement the Act at minimum social costs and, if necessary, to explore alternative ways of doing so.\nNote that the projects and services requiring the largest investments constitute the nation\u2019s physical infrastructure."}
