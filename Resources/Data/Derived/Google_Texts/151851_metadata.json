Critics say it is a crafty political move that would limit the ambition of proposals on everything from expanding Social Security to healthcare reform. It reinforces a long-running Republican argument that some would prefer to defeat head on. And, to put it simply, it makes it hard to pay for things Democrats want.\n\nRead More: Clinton and Sanders Offer Competing Visions of Health Care\n\nAt the heart of the debate, critics of Clinton\u2019s pledge say, is how committed the Democratic Party will be to a progressive agenda in the coming years.\n\n\u201cThere are situations where the middle class would clearly benefit by paying for government program rather than the private sector,\u201d said Jim Dean, the chair of Democracy for America and brother of 2004 presidential candidate Howard Dean. \u201cAs Democrats, we can\u2019t get into this discussion of, \u2018I\u2019m not going to raise taxes, and the others are tax-and-spend liberals.'\u201d\n\nClinton\u2019s campaign counters that she\u2019d still be able to pay for her ambitious domestic policy proposals by raising taxes on the wealthy. And they reject the idea that it\u2019s a political move, arguing that the pledge fits squarely within her campaign\u2019s objective of raising take-home pay for the middle class, a goal that has guided many of her major policy announcements, from debt-free public college to new middle-class tax credits.\n\n\u201cGiven rising income inequality, it makes sense now more than ever to ask the wealthiest Americans to pay their fair share rather than reduce the take-home pay of middle-class workers,\u201d said Brian Fallon, Clinton\u2019s press secretary. \u201cHillary Clinton\u2019s plan\u2014which calls for major new investments in higher education, infrastructure, and universal pre-K\u2014proves it is completely possible to propose bold, ambitious ideas and pay for them without resorting to tax hikes on working families.\u201d\n\nClinton has also proposed two major middle class tax cuts in the past week, including one on Friday for an individual credit on health care costs valued at up to $2,500, and a credit for families of up to $5,000. On Sunday she called for a $6,000 tax credit for families to cover caregiving costs.\n\n\u201cYou deserve a raise, not a tax increase, and I\u2019m not going to stand for that,\u201d Clinton said in Memphis on Friday.\n\nRead More: Clinton Calls for Middle Class Tax Cuts\n\nFor Clinton, the pledge has been more than a guiding fiscal policy. It has been a wedge issue in the Democratic primary, and her campaign has used it in the past week to repeatedly attack Sanders for endorsing policies that they say would harm the middle class. Clinton has repeated her line on the stump about not raising taxes, and her campaign has pointedly said Sanders\u2019 plan would hurt middle class incomes without providing the broad benefits the Vermont Senator claims.\n\nSanders has struck back, with his aides accusing Clinton of taking a Republican\u2019s approach to economic problems and calling Clinton\u2019s criticism attack a \u201cfalse attack.\u201d\n\nClinton is out of step with the Democratic mainstream, Sanders\u2019 aides say.\n\n\u201cYou have a candidate who claims to be a progressive and is essentially laying out an approach to problems that is a Republican approach,\u201d said Jeff Weaver, Sanders\u2019 campaign manager. \u201cIt\u2019s an instinctive move back to the corporate centrism that the Democratic rank-and-file has disavowed.\u201d\n\nMore than half a dozen economists told TIME that while Clinton\u2019s red line may be good politics in a general election, it is misguided policy that would limit her ability to work with Congress to enact a domestic agenda. They say that Clinton\u2019s $250,000-threshold constrains her from proposing progressive items that might require broad tax increases and give her an arbitrary obstacle to negotiating a smart tax policy.\n\n\u201cFrom the perspective of the progressive policies we actually need\u2014not to mention the pressures on the fiscal budget in coming years\u2014it\u2019s a serious mistake to sign up to these thresholds as if they\u2019re etched in stone,\u201d said Jared Bernstein, chief economist for Vice President Joe Biden from 2009 to 2011.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not conceptually very different from Republicans who say they agree to the Grover Norquist pledge, \u2018I will never raise taxes on anybody,\u2019\u201d said Roberton Williams, fellow at the Tax Policy Center, referring to the conservative activist who has pushed Republican lawmakers to sign a no-tax pledge. \u201cClinton just adds the clause \u2018on the the middle class.\u2019\u201d\n\nAt least one economist from a conservative outlet also argued that the pledge would make it harder to reduce the deficit.\n\n\u201cAs a long-run policy, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s viable for our country to say that we\u2019re not going to raise taxes on people making less than $250,000,\u201d said Alan Viard, an economist with the American Enterprise Institute.\n\nA Clinton aide disagreed, saying it was politically unrealistic to expect Congress to enact to any broad tax hike on the middle class, adding that in practical terms, Clinton\u2019s pledge does not close off any options if she wins the White House. Clinton\u2019s ambitious progressive agenda can be paid for without targeting working families, the aide said.\n\nThe debate carries with it echoes of a seminal moment in recent domestic politics: George H.W. Bush\u2019s vow not to raise any taxes at the 1988 Republican convention. When Bush broke that pledge to broker a deal with congressional Democrats, it arguably cost him his re-election, with Republicans bashing him for raising taxes and Clinton\u2019s husband, then the Arkansas Governor, using it to undermine his trustworthiness.\n\nRead More: What to Know About Clinton\u2019s Economic Proposals\n\nDuring the 2008 Democratic primary, then-Sens. Barack Obama and Clinton both pledged not to raise taxes on families earning under $250,000, a promise that the Obama Administration has largely upheld in his seven years in office which has shaped much of his policy. The Administration has repeatedly worked around the $250,000 cutoff, and many of his proposals have come right up to the line he drew in his 2008 campaign.\n\nAs part of the Affordable Care Act, for example, families earning over $250,000 began paying 0.9% more on their wages. A 2013 Obama fiscal deal limited personal exemptions for married couples earning over $300,000. Overall, the average federal tax paid by the top 1% of households has gone up more than 6 percentage points to an estimated 33.8%, according to the Tax Policy Center.\n\nTwo former Obama Administration officials who are now helping Clinton\u2019s campaign coauthored a paper after Obama\u2019s reelection in 2012 that advocated for a slight increase in taxes on families making $100,000 to $250,000 per year\u2014well within the tax bracket Clinton has said she would protect.\n\nJohn Podesta, now Clinton\u2019s campaign chair and formerly a counselor to President Obama, and Neera Tanden, an informal advisor to the Clinton campaign and formerly a senior Obama advisor, were among eleven co-authors of the December 2012 paper. The paper called for a 0.3% increase on families in the $100,000 to $250,000 range.\n\nRead More: Clinton to Propose Tax Credit for Caregivers\n\nTanden, who is the president of the Center for American Progress, explained that the deficit was larger in 2012 and would have required a different fiscal approach. She now supports Clinton\u2019s pledge, saying that the middle class has been squeezed even further in the Obama years. A commitment not to raise taxes on middle earners makes more sense than ever, Tanden said.\n\n\u201cThe wealthy have so much more wealth than they\u2019ve ever had and the middle class is struggling more than it has,\u201d Tanden said. \u201cSo why we would think we would have to tax middle class folks to get enough income doesn\u2019t make sense to me.\u201d\n\nA Clinton aide declined to comment on Podesta\u2019s support of the policy three years ago.\n\nThe no-new taxes debate between Clinton and Sanders reached a boiling point in the days after the Democratic debate last Saturday.\n\nSanders supports a huge and expensive single-payer healthcare plan that would guarantee healthcare to all Americans, in the style of Canada and European countries. He hasn\u2019t announced a new single-payer healthcare plan so far this campaign, but a 2013 plan he introduced in the Senate called for a 2.2% payroll tax increase and a tax on employers of 6.7% to raise the trillions of dollars the program would cost.\n\nClinton\u2019s proposals also come with a big price tag. She has already proposed a $350-billion plan to make public college debt-free, and a campaign aide said that Clinton will in the coming weeks announce a new paid family leave program that will likely cost in the range of $400 billion. She has not announced an infrastructure program, but it is likely to cost in the hundreds of billions of dollars as well, a campaign aide said.\n\nThe campaign say that those big-ticket items and others will be easily be paid for by tax increases on the wealthy, and her policy shop is rolling out a more detailed tax plan in the next few weeks.\n\nEven as Clinton\u2019s rivals and some progressives compare her to a Republican candidate and point to deep ideological differences, the frontrunner has emphasized her closeness to the other Democrats.\n\nAmericans \u201cneed a raise, not a tax increase,\u201d Clinton said to cheers at a barbecue in Iowa the day after the debate, knocking her Democratic rivals. But, Clinton said, \u201cOur differences pale compared to what we believe, what we stand for.\u201d\n\nRead More: How Clinton Is Targeting Republican Candidates", "article_metadata": {"description": "They argue it would limit the progressive agenda.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "Some fear it would limit the progressive agenda.", "title": "Why Hillary Clinton's Tax Pledge Is Dividing Democrats", "url": "http://time.com/4126685/hillary-clinton-middle-class-tax-pledge/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/hillary-clinton-tax-pledge.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=594", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "TIME", "image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/hillary-clinton-tax-pledge.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=594"}, "description": "Some fear it would limit the progressive agenda.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Why Hillary Clinton's Tax Pledge Is Dividing Democrats"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "hillary clinton, hillary clinton taxes, hillary clinton tax pledge, hillary clinton middle class", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Hillary Clinton, Hillary Clinton taxes, Hillary Clinton tax pledge, Hillary Clinton middle class"}, "article_summary": "She now supports Clinton\u2019s pledge, saying that the middle class has been squeezed even further in the Obama years.\nRead More: Clinton Calls for Middle Class Tax CutsFor Clinton, the pledge has been more than a guiding fiscal policy.\n'\u201dClinton\u2019s campaign counters that she\u2019d still be able to pay for her ambitious domestic policy proposals by raising taxes on the wealthy.\n\u201cThe wealthy have so much more wealth than they\u2019ve ever had and the middle class is struggling more than it has,\u201d Tanden said.\nJohn Podesta, now Clinton\u2019s campaign chair and formerly a counselor to President Obama, and Neera Tanden, an informal advisor to the Clinton campaign and formerly a senior Obama advisor, were among eleven co-authors of the December 2012 paper."}
