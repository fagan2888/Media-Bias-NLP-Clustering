Bannon:\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nThis gun grab is completely unconstitutional and I fear the Congress will do the same thing they\u2019ve done in the past\u201d when Obama has acted unconstitutionally. \u201cThey funded Obamacare. They funded executive amnesty\u2026. I fear that if the people do not rise up quickly and strongly, that this Congress will cave once again.\n\nEspinoza said if she is elected to Congress, she would not vote for Paul Ryan, or anyone like him, for leadership. She also criticized GOP Rep. John Culberson, who currently holds the seat.\n\nCiting Culberson\u2019s Committee assignments, Espinoza said, \u201cHe has the power of the purse to stop all this and look at what he did. He funded Planned Parenthood, although he sent out an e-alert telling people he would not. He funded Obamacare. He even funded this executive amnesty\u2026. I cannot believe this man is not resigning.\u201d\n\nThe website for Espinoza\u2019s grassroots campaign is MariaforAmerca.com.\n\nShe blasted Obama\u2019s speech, asking where were his tears as a host of American citizens she named were \u201cslaughtered\u201d by illegal immigrants.", "article_metadata": {"description": "National Director of the Remembrance Project Maria Espinoza is planning a run for the House in Texas' 7th District, and weighing in on President Obama's executive action on guns.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "National Director of the Remembrance Project Maria Espinoza is planning a run for the House in Texas' 7th District, and weighing in on President Obama's executive action on guns.", "title": "Maria Espinoza: Obama Didn't Cry For Americans Slaughtered By Illegal Immigrants - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/12/Espinoza.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/01/06/maria-espinoza-obama-didnt-cry-americans-slaughtered-illegal-immigrants/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "National Director of the Remembrance Project Maria Espinoza is planning a run for the House in Texas' 7th District, and weighing in on President Obama's executive action on guns.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/12/Espinoza.jpg", "title": "Maria Espinoza: Obama Didn't Cry For Americans Slaughtered By Illegal Immigrants - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": ",2nd Amendment, Big Government, Radio,Espinoza", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2nd Amendment", "published_time": "2016-01-06T07:33:16-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,2nd Amendment,Radio"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "They funded executive amnesty\u2026.\n\u201cThey funded Obamacare.\nHe funded Obamacare.\nShe blasted Obama\u2019s speech, asking where were his tears as a host of American citizens she named were \u201cslaughtered\u201d by illegal immigrants.\nHe even funded this executive amnesty\u2026."}
