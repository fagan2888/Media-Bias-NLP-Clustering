But Furman University hailed The Rev. Jesse Jackson as an \u201cglobal peacemaker\u201d as he slammed the Tea Party and called the United States the \u201cland of the free, home of genocide.\u201d\n\nThe civil rights icon spoke to students at the South Carolina college Wednesday night in an event titled, \u201cKeeping Hope Alive: Commemorating the 50th Anniversary of the Civil Rights Movement,\u201d Campus Reform reported. But Jackson used the lecture to slam Republicans, going so far as to claim the Tea Party was born from efforts to preserve slavery in the tirade recorded by a Furman student.\n\n\u201cThose in the Confederacy sought to maintain the walls [of slavery] and secede from the country, the shots fired at Fort Sumter \u2013 the beginning of the Tea Party, the \u2018Fort Sumter\u2019 Tea Party, who sought to secede from the Union, set their own government, their own currency, sought to ally with France and Britain, to form their own country,\u201d Jackson said.\n\nHe went on to bash President Ronald Reagan and former Republican Presidential nominee Barry Goldwater, who, according to Jackson, were proponents of segregation.\n\n\u201cGoldwater and Reagan \u2013 had they been successful, it would have been illegal for blacks and whites to play together on a Saturday afternoon,\u201d he said. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t have had the Carolina Panthers behind the cotton curtain playing the Atlanta Falcons . . . it would have been illegal for them to even sit together.\u201d\n\nStudents can be heard shouting \u201cPreach it, preach it!\u201d in the background, National Review reported.\n\nBut the former Democratic presidential candidate didn\u2019t stop there.\n\nJackson continued, calling the U.S. the \u201cland of the free, home of genocide,\u201d a reference to the treatment of Native americans. Jackson claimed this treatment led to the naming of the Washington Redskins football team.\n\n\u201cIn reality what happened was if If you killed an Indian \u2026 finally you got paid for the scalps of the red skins of the Indians \u2026 and that\u2019s how we got the Washington Redskins football league.\u201d\n\nAccording to Campus Reform, Jackson was well received by the audience. But, there was some controversy surrounding his visit.\n\nStudents gathered outside the event to protest his speech and handed out fliers telling of Jackson\u2019s controversial past. According to National Review, the literature was eventually confiscated by administrators who told the protesters to leave. But the students didn\u2019t budge, saying they were protected by the First Amendment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a shame that Furman decided to celebrate such a historical event with such a divisive individual such as Rev. Jackson,\u201d Lauren Cooley, who organized the protest, told Campus Reform. \u201cHe\u2019s been stirring up division for years through outlandish anti-Semitic, anti-white, and anti-conservative statements.\u201d\n\nCorrection: This article originally stated that Furman University is located in North Carolina.
