Yet the rulings may allow consumers to forgo paying their premiums.\n\nUnder ACA law, consumers can go 90 days without paying their premiums and not lose coverage, FierceHealthPayer previously reported. Because coverage stops on the last day of the first month of the grace period, if an individual does not pay for the three months, it's possible he or should could get coverage through that entire first month, notes Vox.\n\nCome December, it's possible more consumers can find ways around paying for their plans. Under federal regulations, payments made by an individual who re-enrolls in a new insurance plan do not automatically pay for outstanding debt on an old, 2014 plan.\n\nHypothetically, an individual could refuse to pay for their plan this December and then rejoin their plan next year. Meaning, their new health plan cannot pay for their old, unpaid one, according to Vox.\n\nTo ensure timely payment, insurers are urging the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to alter its regulations to allow new payment to cover outstanding debt. This would allow consumers to use their 2015 premiums to cover their unpaid 2014 months.\n\nWhat's more, technical glitches continue to plague many insurers' payment systems, which contribute to the vast number of unpaid premiums. To make payment systems work, insurers may need to establish two separate accounts for the same individual, notes Vox.\n\nFor more:\n\n- here's the Vox article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nACA grace period could leave insurers with unpaid premiums\n\nDoc insurance exchange worries: Premium nonpayment, low reimbursement\n\nWhat's really driving unpaid premiums?\n\nBilling problems plague insurers", "article_metadata": {"description": "Thanks to a loophole in the Affordable Care Act regulations, insurers worry customers who purchased plans on the federal marketplace could evade paying their December premiums, reports Vox.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthPayer", "description": "Thanks to a loophole in the Affordable Care Act regulations, insurers worry customers who purchased plans on the federal marketplace could evade paying their December premiums, reports Vox.", "title": "Insurers worry ACA loophole could lead to unpaid premiums, bad debt", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthpayer.com/story/insurers-worry-aca-loophole-leads-unpaid-premiums/2014-07-24", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthpayer.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "healthpayer", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "keywords": "90-day grace period,Affordable Care Act Regulations,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes,Premiums,Unpaid Premiums", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda480\"", "article_summary": "What's more, technical glitches continue to plague many insurers' payment systems, which contribute to the vast number of unpaid premiums.\nFor more:- here's the Vox articleRelated Articles:ACA grace period could leave insurers with unpaid premiumsDoc insurance exchange worries: Premium nonpayment, low reimbursementWhat's really driving unpaid premiums?\nThanks to a loophole in the Affordable Care Act regulations, insurers worry customers who purchased plans on the federal marketplace could evade paying their December premiums, reports Vox.\nTo ensure timely payment, insurers are urging the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to alter its regulations to allow new payment to cover outstanding debt.\nUnder ACA law, consumers can go 90 days without paying their premiums and not lose coverage, FierceHealthPayer previously reported."}
