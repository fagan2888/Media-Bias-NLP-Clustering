Nearly 10% of that annual health spending is for prescription drugs.\n\nFor a coterie of large cap companies, these conditions add up to huge profits as far as the eye can see. One such player that looks particularly promising now is Switzerland-based drug giant Novartis AG (ADR) (NVN).\n\nWith a whopping market cap of $221.6 billion, Novartis has the resources to compete in an increasingly ruthless drug industry, where payers are pushing down costs and the price tag for research and development keeps rising.\n\nNovartis holds a global portfolio of more than 50 marketed pharmaceutical products. Among Novartis\u2019 biggest sellers are Diovan for hypertension and Gleevec for leukemia. Since 2013, the company has received roughly 13 regulatory approvals in the U.S., Europe and Japan.\n\nOn Dec. 16, Novartis won approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for its drug Signifor LAR to treat patients with acromegaly, a rare and life-threatening hormonal disorder. Approvals for any drug company are rare, expensive and time-consuming, involving billions of dollars and a maze of bureaucracy.\n\nOn Dec. 12, Novartis announced that its new antibody drug Cosentyx showed superiority in clinical tests over its rival Stelara from Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) in clearing skin blemishes for the treatment of psoriasis.\n\nIt was a watershed announcement about a potential blockbuster drug, but Novartis stock is a solid long-term growth proposition regardless. Cosentyx would just be icing on the cake.\n\nNovartis also continues to bring new ophthalmology treatments to market, where demand is on track for multiyear growth. An aging and sicker population combined with the continuing expansion of coverage under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) will propel Novartis stock higher in 2015 and long afterwards.\n\nDuring the next decade, the graying of populations around the globe will boost the number of cataract and glaucoma patients, all prospective customers of Novartis\u2019 eye care unit, Alcon.\n\nMoreover, Obamacare will extend eye care coverage to millions of Americans who previously endured eye ailments without insurance.\n\nObamacare is in the headlines (yet again), as the Supreme Court weighs another constitutional issue concerning a technicality over state-level responsibilities. But however the case turns out, objective investors know that the massive health care law is here to stay.\n\nObamacare was pushed through a reluctant Congress in 2010 with the vigorous lobbying of large drug companies that will amass substantial profits from the legislation\u2019s expansion of drug coverage to an estimated 32 million Americans. These cash-rich drug companies \u2014 Novartis among them \u2014 have a vested interest in the law\u2019s eventual success.\n\nNVS: Full-Bodied Results\n\nNovartis\u2019 third-quarter revenue hit $14.7 billion, a year-over-year increase of 4%, while earnings per share (EPS) increased 10% to $1.37, beating analysts\u2019 expectations of revenue of $14.5 billion and EPS of $1.31. Third-quarter earnings leaped 45% to $3.2 billion.\n\nNovartis recently announced a two-year, $5 billion stock buyback plan. At the same time, NVS is expanding into fast-growing areas of health care such as dermatology, heart failure, respiratory illnesses and cell therapy.\n\nPositioned to benefit from Obamacare as well as global demographic trends, Novartis stock is a good bet on the inexorable rise of the money-making medical machine.\n\nAs of this writing, John Persinos did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace", "article_metadata": {"description": "Novartis stock is positioned to grow from Obamacare, demographic trends and exciting new drugs in the pipeline.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "InvestorPlace", "description": "Novartis stock is positioned to grow from Obamacare, demographic trends and exciting new drugs in the pipeline.", "title": "Novartis Stock: RX for Your Portfolio | InvestorPlace", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://investorplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/novartis.jpeg", "updated_time": "2014-12-16T14:59:06-04:00", "url": "http://investorplace.com/2014/12/novartis-stock-nvs-rx-portfolio/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Novartis stock is positioned to grow from Obamacare, demographic trends and exciting new drugs in the pipeline.", "creator": "@JohnPersinos1", "image": "http://investorplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Novartis185.jpg", "title": "Novartis Stock: RX for Your Portfolio | InvestorPlace", "site": "@InvestorPlace", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100002035369734}, "yandex-verification": "7449d54f0a1869d7", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/investorplace", "section": "Stocks to Buy", "published_time": "2014-12-16T12:12:12-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-16T14:59:06-04:00", "author": "johnpersinos"}, "keywords": "markets, Novartis stock, NVS", "google-site-verification": "5MtKaaO4K0OK-C2y-n9MKUc_WzF9GSkH0fLgruR0TKM", "pubdate": 20141216, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "markets, novartis stock, nvs"}, "article_summary": "It was a watershed announcement about a potential blockbuster drug, but Novartis stock is a solid long-term growth proposition regardless.\nThese cash-rich drug companies \u2014 Novartis among them \u2014 have a vested interest in the law\u2019s eventual success.\nPositioned to benefit from Obamacare as well as global demographic trends, Novartis stock is a good bet on the inexorable rise of the money-making medical machine.\nNovartis recently announced a two-year, $5 billion stock buyback plan.\nDuring the next decade, the graying of populations around the globe will boost the number of cataract and glaucoma patients, all prospective customers of Novartis\u2019 eye care unit, Alcon."}
