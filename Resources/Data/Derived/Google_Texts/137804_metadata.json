But before we provide the prognosis, let\u2019s take stock of where we are. Currently there are an estimated 12.7 million Americans getting health insurance through ObamaCare, which is a relatively slight increase from 11.7 million in early 2015. However, as Kaiser cautions, \u201cActual enrollment will end up somewhat lower than this because some people will not pay their premiums or will have their coverage terminated due to inconsistencies on their applications, and there is typically additional attrition as the year progresses (e.g., as some enrollees get jobs with health benefits).\u201d\n\nThis explains why the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services last week reported that as of \u201cDecember 31, 2015, about 8.8 million consumers had effectuated Health Insurance Marketplace coverage,\u201d which The Hill notes is \u201c3.5 percent below the administration\u2019s target\u201d of 9.1 million and \u201ca drop of almost 25 percent compared to the 11.7 million people who were signed up at the beginning of 2015.\u201d There\u2019s no question that participation is bad, but even the government\u2019s \u201ctarget\u201d rate is deceiving. Why? Because paltry enrollment since ObamaCare\u2019s inception has forced the feds to set the bar much lower. And moving the goal posts is what this administration does best.\n\nConsider the magnitude of Congressional Budget Office revisions. A year ago the CBO expected around 21 million Americans to be enrolled in 2016. But by January the CBO made a mammoth change, calling for only 13 million. And if the Kaiser Family Foundation is correct, that\u2019s not too far from what will probably be the total number of consumers for the foreseeable future. Kaiser says \u201cthe 12.7 million signups so far represent 46% of the \u2018potential market\u2019 for the marketplaces,\u201d and an extrapolation of current trends suggests an \u201c\u2018effectuated\u2019 enrollment total of 14.7 million,\u201d or what it describes as \u201ca reasonable estimate of a ceiling on what marketplace enrollment could grow to over the next several years, assuming current levels of premium subsidies and outreach.\u201d\n\nKaiser concludes, \u201cJudging by the experience of the top performing states, there is considerable room for enrollment growth over the next several years. However, even if all states signed people up at the rate of the top 10 states, enrollment would still fall well short of projections by CBO, suggesting that those forecasts may have been unrealistic.\u201d The reality is that government programs never live up to the hype \u2014 and numbers don\u2019t lie. As John Adams once said, \u201cFacts are stubborn things; and whatever may be our wishes, our inclination, or the dictates of our passions, they cannot alter the state of facts and evidence.\u201d The fact is, it was the authors of ObamaCare who had egregiously unrealistic expectations.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Study suggests 14.7 million will be the total number of ObamaCare enrollees.", "csrf-token": "xZKLVIc+6OjRFvcouO+NgGjt9WThSMzDsoFBEXq6OOI=", "msapplication-TileColor": "#2b5797", "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "og": {"site_name": "The Patriot Post", "description": "Study suggests 14.7 million will be the total number of ObamaCare enrollees.", "title": "Is the ObamaCare Death Spiral Underway?", "url": "http://patriotpost.us/posts/41317", "image": "http://assets.patriotpost.us/images/2015-09-29-625f1692.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100002378661032, "app_id": 217327155053459}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/mstile-144x144.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Right Hooks Is the ObamaCare Death Spiral Underway?\nCurrently there are an estimated 12.7 million Americans getting health insurance through ObamaCare, which is a relatively slight increase from 11.7 million in early 2015.\nA recent Kaiser Family Foundation analysis bodes tremendously ill for ObamaCare.\nA year ago the CBO expected around 21 million Americans to be enrolled in 2016.\nBecause paltry enrollment since ObamaCare\u2019s inception has forced the feds to set the bar much lower."}
