Rowan County, Kentucky Clerk Kim Davis appeared on “The Kelly File” to defend her decision to remain in office, saying that she shouldn’t “have to quit a job that I’m good at” before complaining that “they can accommodate for all sorts of other issues,” but “it just doesn’t seem right” that the state won’t accommodate her bigotry.

Host Megyn Kelly asked her whether she is receiving support, to which Davis replied “I guess it just depends what side of the argument you’re on as to whether you treat me good or you treat me bad, or if you think I’m a villain or if you think I’m just someone that God is using.”

Davis later insisted that “it’s never been a gay or lesbian issue for me” — even though gays and lesbians were the only ones she was actively discriminating against — “it has been about upholding the word of God and how God defined marriage from the very beginning of time.”
