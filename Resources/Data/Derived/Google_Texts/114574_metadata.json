Officials expect close to 400,000 people to head downtown for the event.\n\nThe parade will feature close to 225 floats and entries, along with performances from bagpipers and step-dancers.\n\n\u201cThe Irish culture is here,\u201d said Theresa Melaragno, who serves on the parade\u2019s board of directors. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a day to come downtown and drink beer. It\u2019s really to share the Irish heritage with the state of Colorado.\u201d\n\nThe parade will block vehicle access to Blake Street, 17th Street and Wynkoop Street starting at 8 a.m., Melaragno said.\n\nThe event will leave from the Coors Field parking lot and begin its route on Wynkoop Street at 9:30 a.m. The procession will disband at the Coors Field parking lot at Blake and 27th Streets.\n\nThe downtown streets will reopen immediately following the parade. Officials expect the event to last roughly four hours.\n\nLimited parking will be available in the Coors Field parking structure and at the Colorado Convention Center. Parade officials encourage participants to use public transportation or arrive before the streets close to find a spot. Parking passes are also available for several lots and garages adjacent to the parade route.\n\nDrinkers who plan to enjoy a pint in honor of the holiday will have a chance to test their impairment before they hit the road.\n\nRepresentatives from the Colorado Department of Transportation will be stationed at Irish Snug, a pub on Capitol Hill, to provide breathalyzer tests for anyone interested in knowing their blood-alcohol concentration. The tests will be offered from 2 to 5 p.m.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do is go to places where they drink to help people understand their limit when it comes to drinking and driving,\u201d said Sam Cole,CDOT communications manager. \u201cWe think there needs to be more awareness around blood-alcohol content and how that impairs you.\u201d\n\nKaty Canada: 303-954-1043, kcanada@denverpost.com or @KatySusanna", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "St. Patrick\u2019s Day Parade will block downtown Denver streets Saturday", "title": "St. Patrick\u2019s Day Parade will block downtown Denver streets Saturday", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/03/11/st-patricks-day-parade-will-block-downtown-denver-streets-saturday/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160311__CD17STPATS_KO13170p1.jpg", "height": 476}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160311__CD17STPATS_KO13170p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-11T12:58:32+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-15T01:35:46+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Traffic"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3044\"", "article_summary": "Limited parking will be available in the Coors Field parking structure and at the Colorado Convention Center.\nParade officials encourage participants to use public transportation or arrive before the streets close to find a spot.\nThe event will leave from the Coors Field parking lot and begin its route on Wynkoop Street at 9:30 a.m.\nThe procession will disband at the Coors Field parking lot at Blake and 27th Streets.\nThe downtown streets will reopen immediately following the parade."}
