A 23-year-old man who got stuck in a chimney is recovering after firefighters used drills and a sledgehammer to free him.

Two of the man’s friends said they had locked him out of the house as a practical joke just before 3 a.m. Sunday. What happened next was no laughing matter for the victim of the trick.

The man decided the only way he was going to be able to get into the home was by going down the chimney of the home in the 5900 block of E. Spring Road, Phoenix firefighters said.

“This proved to be a bad decision and fortunately for him the Phoenix Fire Department Rescue crews are trained up to handle these types of confined space incidents,” a Phoenix Fire Department spokesman said.

After about 30 minutes of drilling and hammering, rescuers were able to free him.

Video shot by Phoenix firefighters showed the shirtless man covered in black soot.

He was taken to a nearby hospital to get checked out.
