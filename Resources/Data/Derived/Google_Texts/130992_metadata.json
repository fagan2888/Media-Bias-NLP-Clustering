[...] San Francisco has passed more laws than any other major city to improve the lives of low-wage workers such as dishwashers, bussers, line cooks and waiters; Berkeley, Oakland and other Bay Area cities are not far behind.  To get a sense, The Chronicle examined 20 years\u2019 worth of menus from restaurants that hold steady spots on the annual Michael Bauer\u2019s Top 100 Restaurants list.`  After tracking 22 signature dishes or prix-fixe menus from 14 restaurants, we found that prices have risen, on average, 26 percent since 2010 and 52 percent since 2005 \u2014 up 7.5 percent in the last year alone.  Signature dishes in this stratum are rare, since many chefs rearrange their menus with the frequency of an interior decorator\u2019s showroom.  The dishes we identified ranged from steamed barbecue pork buns at Yank Sing ($3.50 in 2005; $5.50 in 2016) to Chez Panisse\u2019s Saturday night dinner ($75 in 2005; $125 now).  Comparing their prices to inflation measures shows our buying power can\u2019t keep up.  The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 Bay Area consumer price index, for instance, has risen 13.6 percent from 2010 to 2015 and 27.6 percent since 2005 \u2014 only half as fast as menu prices.  Most menu prices are calculated according to a formula: this percentage for food costs, that percentage for labor, this percentage for rent and other expenses, with 10 percent profit if you\u2019re lucky.  House of Prime Rib owner Joe Betz says he\u2019s paying much more for dairy and egg products, but the real culprit is beef; his meat costs have doubled in recent years, the effect of widespread drought across the western half of the country.  Yet owner Charles Phan says the dish, which requires a half-pound of grass-fed filet, consistently surpasses his upper limits for food costs.  Garbage costs have gone up, partly because Recology has made it impossible for the independent trucks that used to cart away cardboard and glass to sell recycling, forcing businesses to pay the larger company for pickup.  \u201cMost responsible restaurants should have been paying way above minimum wage,\u201d says Gilbert Pilgram, owner of Zuni Cafe.  Phan says Slanted Door has recently lost longtime employees to tech companies and gentrification \u2014 several employees who had moved to Hercules finally gave up on making a daily three-hour commute.  Providing health insurance for employees was rare \u2014 though not unheard of \u2014 across the restaurant industry until 2008, when San Francisco\u2019s Health Care Security Ordinance went into effect.    [...] businesses with more than 20 employees who work eight hours a week or more must spend a certain amount on health care per employee per hour worked.  The money can go toward health insurance plans or some kind of medical savings account.  The Affordable Care Act, which went into effect in 2013, layered on another set of health care requirements for restaurants with more than 50 full-time equivalent employees.  The effect of San Francisco\u2019s Health Care Security Ordinance, coupled with the Affordable Care Act, \u201cis disproportionately impactful because restaurants are labor intensive compared to other types of businesses,\u201d says Gwyneth Borden, president of the Golden Gate Restaurant Association.  Studying profit and loss statements and jiggering menu prices is the very meat of owning a restaurant, but talking about it publicly makes many restaurateurs skittish.  Zuni owner  Pilgram sums up the disparity between costs and perception: People sometimes ask, \u2018If I can buy a chicken at Safeway for $6, why am I paying $50?\u2019 Well, my chicken is better than Safeway\u2019s.
