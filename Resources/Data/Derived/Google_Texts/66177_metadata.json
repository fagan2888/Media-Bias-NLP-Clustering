They underpay them, overwork them, and there are no repercussions.\u201d\n\nAfter signing a document promising compliance, restaurant owners are provided with a decal to display in their stores, according to a City of Bloomington press release.\n\n\u201cWe want to protect vulnerable workers, the undocumented, the homeless, the invisible people who hold up the restaurant industry. That\u2019s really what the Fair Labor Initiative is intended to address, to bring those people into the light,\u201d ?Morris said.\n\nRestaurants must also adhere to federal safety laws and meet insurance requirements, according to the BHRC website.\n\nThe commission reasoned that consumers will want to patronize restaurants that treat workers well, according to the press ?release.\n\n\u201cWe think it\u2019s good for business,\u201d said Barbara McKinney, director of the Bloomington Human Rights Commission.\n\nThe yellow, circular decal features text describing the law.\n\n\u201cIt seemed pretty reasonable to me, a good idea,\u201d said Matt O\u2019Neill, owner of the Runcible Spoon and participant in the initiative.\n\nCriteria for membership in the initiative include following minimum wage requirements and adhering to the Affordable Care Act, among other regulations, according to the press ?release.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s common sense, just follow the law,\u201d O\u2019Neill said.\n\nExplaining his motivations for joining the initiative, O\u2019Neill described his relationship with his ?employees.\n\n\u201cHuman beings are not machines,\u201d O\u2019Neill said. \u201cWe have a personal relationship with our employees, they know how valuable they are to me.\u201d\n\nStudents of IU professor Stepanka Korytova were involved in actively recruiting local businesses for a service-learning project, ?McKinney said.\n\n\u201cStudents are working on it this semester as well \u2014 they are going out right now,\u201d McKinney said.\n\nIn addition to Korytova, Commissioners Byron Bangert and Michael Molenda were instrumental in starting the initiative, ?Morris said.\n\n\u201cByron and Michael have really driven this thing,\u201d Morris said.\n\nThe BHRC hopes to increase compliance and reduce complaints from employees on labor violations, which only have a statute of limitations of 180 days, McKinney said.\n\n\u201cBloomington is a transit community and many employees don\u2019t know their rights, and by the time they come to us it\u2019s too late,\u201d McKinney said.\n\nThe Fair Labor Initiative hopes to sign up more businesses and is planning on offering free resources to interested restaurants, ?according to the release.\n\nRestaurants currently signed on to the initiative include Laughing Planet, the Village Deli, Runcible Spoon, Lennie\u2019s Restaurant & Pub, Bloomington Brewing Company, Uptown Caf\u00e9, Little Tibet, Taste of India, the IU Art Museum Angles Caf\u00e9, Pourhouse Caf\u00e9, Soma and the Atwater and College Mall Subway locations.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more than filling out the form,\u201d O\u2019Neill said. \u201cI have to work every day to make my employees happy and that\u2019s our approach.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Working for the weekend?
