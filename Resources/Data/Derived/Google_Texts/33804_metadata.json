Not too many tough choices get done in Washington, D.C. Everyone likes to kick the can down the road and put the hard decisions off on the next guy. That's not something Mike Rounds is going to do. He's going to confront the problems and find solutions to them, and so that's what's so important to us and so important to kind of getting America back on track.\"\n\nRounds says he's very pleased to accept the Tea Party Express endorsement because they too feel strongly about the conservative values which he says make this country great.\n\nRounds says, \"We all want the same thing. What we want to do is fire Harry Reid as the majority leader. They recognize that. We can't fix things in Washington, D.C. until Republicans take back control of the United States Senate. We have to repeal Obamacare. We have to get the Keystone XL Pipeline in place. We have to go back and protect our Second Amendment rights. This is critical. That's the reason these folks are here. They understand that South Dakota is the linchpin in bringing this back.\"\n\nOne of Rounds' opponents, Independent Gordon Howie said in a release that the announcement by the Tea Party Express endorsing Rounds comes as little surprise.\n\nHe says, quote, \"It only makes sense that their endorsement would be for a candidate that has ridiculed Tea Party activists in South Dakota as professional dissenters.\"", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Republican Mike Rounds continues to get several key pieces of support in his campaign for the U.S. Senate seat in South Dakota.\nWednesday, the Tea Party Express, the nation's largest Tea Party political action committee, was in Rapid City to endorse the former South Dakota governor.", "language": "english", "author": "Tessa Thomas", "og": {"description": "Republican Mike Rounds continues to get several key pieces of support in his campaign for the U.S. Senate seat in South Dakota.\nWednesday, the Tea Party Express, the nation's largest Tea Party political action committee, was in Rapid City to endorse the former South Dakota governor.", "title": "Mike Rounds gains support from the Tea Party Express", "url": "http://www.blackhillsfox.com/home/headlines/Mike-Rounds-gains-support-from-the-Tea-Party-Express--279357902.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/5AB/4DD/5AB4DDD2C9FF40BC8458816ADA041885", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/46E/413/46E41389F9334145A92FC46E7A47BA19.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.blackhillsfox.com", "description": "Republican Mike Rounds continues to get several key pieces of support in his campaign for the U.S. Senate seat in South Dakota.\nWednesday, the Tea Party Express, the nation's largest Tea Party political action committee, was in Rapid City to endorse the former South Dakota governor.", "title": "Mike Rounds gains support from the Tea Party Express", "url": "http://www.blackhillsfox.com/home/headlines/Mike-Rounds-gains-support-from-the-Tea-Party-Express--279357902.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/Rounds+Thumbnail1.jpg", "creator": "@BlackHillsFOX", "site": "@BlackHillsFOX", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Mike Rounds gains support from the Tea Party Express", "google-site-verification": "YxYD3UxJPp8Hk0T5apraugVs1Jdhf3RH0lWipEh29Ww", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Mike Rounds gains support from"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda65b\"", "article_summary": "Wednesday, the Tea Party Express, the nation's largest Tea Party political action committee, was in Rapid City to endorse the former South Dakota governor.\nOne of Rounds' opponents, Independent Gordon Howie said in a release that the announcement by the Tea Party Express endorsing Rounds comes as little surprise.\nThe executive director of the Tea Party Express says the group feels Rounds is a conservative leader, and they're impressed with his record as governor.\nRepublican Mike Rounds continues to get several key pieces of support in his campaign for the U.S. Senate seat in South Dakota.\nRounds says he's very pleased to accept the Tea Party Express endorsement because they too feel strongly about the conservative values which he says make this country great."}
