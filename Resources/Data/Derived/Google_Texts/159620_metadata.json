But each has become a stock tale for Religious Right broadcasters, activists, and in some cases elected officials. These myths \u2013 which are becoming ever more pervasive in the right-wing media \u2013 serve to bolster a larger story, that of a majority religious group in American society becoming a persecuted minority, driven underground in its own country.\n\nThis narrative has become an important rallying cry for a movement that has found itself on the losing side of many of the so-called \u201cculture wars.\u201d By reframing political losses as religious oppression, the Right has attempted to build a justification for turning back advances in gay rights, reproductive rights and religious liberty for minority faiths.\n\nThe religious persecution narrative is nothing new \u2013 it has long been at the core of the Right\u2019s reaction to secular government and religious pluralism \u2013 but it has taken off in recent years in reaction to advances in gay rights and reproductive freedom, and to an increasingly secular and pluralistic society.\n\nThe frantic warnings, fueled by individual persecution myths, range from the insistence that conservative Christians are losing their right to free speech to the claim that the U.S. is on the verge of instituting unconstitutional hate speech laws to dire predictions that religious faith itself might soon be criminalized.\n\nIn recent months, Eagle Forum founder Phyllis Schlafly warned that \u201cwe are in a war for religious liberty\u201d and claimed that President Obama, who speaks frequently and publicly about his Christian faith, \u201cdoesn\u2019t want any expression of religious faith in any public place.\u201d Activist Janet Porter declared that a reality TV star\u2019s suspension from his program represented an effort to \u201cshut down Christians\u201d and, even more chillingly, predicted that religious faith itself would soon be \u201cdeclared unlawful.\u201d Pastor Jim Garlow declared that Christians are \u201cexperiencing full-blown persecution like we have not seen in America.\u201d Family Research Council President Tony Perkins warned that President Obama was colluding with \u201canti-Christian\u201d extremists to \u201cneuter the Church\u201d and \u201csilenc[e] Christians.\u201d South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott insisted, \u201cThe greatest minority under assault today are Christians.\u201d\n\nOne activist after another warns that gay rights will lead to the literal criminalization of Christianity. In April 2014, the American Family Association claimed that there were \u201cseven common careers Christians may no longer hold in America\u201d \u2013 including photography, broadcasting and teaching.\n\nIn 2012, the Family Research Council and Liberty Institute started releasing an annual \u201cSurvey of Religious Hostility in America.\u201d\n\nThese surveys of supposed \u201creligious hostility\u201d include prominent court cases in which the Religious Right and civil liberties groups have legitimate, long-held differences of opinion on where the line between church and state should lie \u2013 for instance, the case of a large cross displayed on public land in the Mojave Desert.\n\nThey also chronicle supposed episodes of individual \u201cpersecution,\u201d including many originally promoted by Fox News\u2019 Todd Starnes and many that have been long debunked. For instance, the group\u2019s 2012 report told the story of Raymond Raines, a boy who was allegedly punished by a teacher for praying in his school cafeteria. The Raymond Raines story has been around for 20 years and has been repeatedly debunked; Raines was actually disciplined for fighting.\n\nThe claim that efforts to draw a line between church and state represent a suppression of the individual exercise of religion is key to the Right\u2019s persecution narrative. In order to convincingly argue that being on the losing side of a policy debate or a legal argument amounts to religious persecution, you must first establish that the media, government and the culture at large are actively hostile to people of faith.\n\nThis requires a constant supply of stories of supposed religious persecution. And for that, the Right has Todd Starnes.\n\nTodd Starnes: A Look into the Right-Wing Myth Machine\n\nThe most prolific manufacturer and promoter of apocryphal stories of American Christian persecution working today is Fox News reporter Todd Starnes. If a story emerges about a service member punished for his or her Christian beliefs or a schoolchild banned from talking about Christmas, it most likely originated with or was promoted by Starnes. And there\u2019s a good chance the facts have been either severely distorted or completely fabricated.\n\nFor an example of how the Starnes myth machine works, take the story of Air Force Sgt. Phillip Monk, \u201crelieved of his duties,\u201d according to Starnes, \u201cafter he disagreed with his openly gay commander when she wanted to severely punish an instructor who had expressed religious objections to homosexuality.\u201d\n\n\u201cChristians have to go into the closet,\u201d Monk told Starnes. \u201cWe are being robbed of our dignity and respect. We can\u2019t be who we are.\u201d Starnes added: \u201c[I]n essence, Christians are trading places with homosexuals.\u201d\n\nIt appears that Monk\u2019s story was being shopped around by his attorneys at Liberty Institute, one of several Christian Right legal groups that devote themselves to digging up and publicizing alleged cases of persecution. The Alliance Defending Freedom and the American Center for Law and Justice have played a similar role, cheered on by allies in groups such as the Family Research Council (FRC) and the American Family Association (AFA).\n\nThe Monk story hit a nerve in a movement still reeling from the 2010 repeal of the military\u2019s \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d policy banning openly gay service members.\n\nAfter Starnes reported Monk\u2019s tale in August 2013, the story spread like wildfire in the Religious Right. Liberty University official Shawn Akers cited the story to claim that Christians were now the victims of a new \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d policy. The AFA\u2019s Bryan Fischer pointed to Monk\u2019s commander to claim that \u201chomosexuals that are in the military\u201d could now \u201cget away with absolutely anything.\u201d Monk was invited to share his tale at a Values Voter Summit panel on the alleged trend of anti-Christian persecution. The Family Research Council produced a tearful video in which Monk told of how he was \u201creassigned by his commander because of his belief that marriage is the union of a man and a woman.\u201d\n\nBut Monk\u2019s story just wasn\u2019t true. In Starnes\u2019 very first report on Monk, he quoted an Air Force spokesman who explained that Monk hadn\u2019t been punished but had simply come to the end of his assignment. A subsequent Air Force investigation found, according to the Military Times, that \u201cMonk was not removed from his position, but rather moved, as scheduled, to another Lackland unit, an assignment he was notified of in April.\u201d\n\nThis story repeats itself over and over again in Starnes\u2019 work. When Starnes accused a Georgia school of \u201cconfiscating\u201d a display of teachers\u2019 Christmas cards, it turned out that the display had merely been moved from a hallway to an office to accommodate the privacy concerns of a teacher who had wanted to participate but didn\u2019t want her personal card displayed in a public space. School administrators, caught off-guard by Starnes\u2019 fabricated story, accused him of \u201can intentional and vicious dissemination of untrue information that disrupted the good work going on inside\u201d the school.\n\nWhen Starnes reported in January that a six-year-old girl in California had been stopped in the middle of a class presentation about her family\u2019s Christmas traditions, the story of how the girl was told \u201cshe can\u2019t talk about religion in school\u201d spread rapidly through right-wing media. But this story was also not true. After Starnes\u2019 report took off, the girl\u2019s baffled teacher explained that she had shortened her student\u2019s presentation because of time constraints and had in no way prevented her from talking about her religious faith.\n\nStarnes\u2019 reports about the middle school students forced into a lesbian kiss, the athlete disqualified for thanking God, and the Pentagon blocking a Southern Baptist website unraveled in similar ways. The middle school girls were never required to kiss. The track athlete admitted he was disqualified for taunting and disrespecting a referee. Defense Department employees were briefly unable to access the Southern Baptist website because the denomination\u2019s website was infected with malware.\n\nNo matter how quickly they are debunked, however, these stories are used to build a narrative that bolsters the Religious Right\u2019s political goals\u2026and benefits Starnes himself.\n\nIn April 2014, Starnes reported that an elementary school student in Florida was told by a teacher \u201cthat she was not allowed to pray before eating her lunch time meal\u201d and that \u201cit\u2019s not good\u201d to pray. School officials conducted a thorough investigation of the incident, even staging a lineup for the girl to identify the teacher who had supposedly banned her from praying. In the end, they found absolutely no basis for the claims, and even found that the teacher that the girl identified wasn\u2019t even in the cafeteria when the incident supposedly took place.\n\nThen it came out that an amazing coincidence had occurred: The girl\u2019s father just happened to be head of sales at the company publishing Starnes\u2019 new book, God Less America: Real Stories from the Front Lines of the Attack on Traditional Values.\n\nStarnes\u2019 book chronicles the very sort of story that he repeats in his columns. And the very first page reveals where he thinks America went wrong: \u201cI grew up in a much simpler time\u2026It was a time when father still knew best \u2013 when the girls were girls and the men were men. I grew up when the rainbow was a sign of God\u2019s promise, not gay rights.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel like a Duck Dynasty guy living in a Miley Cyrus world,\u201d he laments.\n\nDuck Dynasty and Redefining the First Amendment\n\nIt\u2019s no coincidence that the very first sentence of Todd Starnes\u2019 book mentions Duck Dynasty, the hit A&E reality show about a family of impressively bearded duck-call manufacturers in Louisiana.\n\nDuck Dynasty \u2013 despite its wide popularity \u2013 has become a polarizing culture-war code ever since one of the show\u2019s stars was briefly suspended by the network after letting loose with homophobic and racist comments in a magazine interview.\n\n\u201cStart with homosexual behavior and just morph out from there. Bestiality, sleeping around with this woman and that woman and that woman and those men,\u201d family patriarch Phil Robertson told GQ. \u201cDon\u2019t be deceived. Neither the adulterers, the idolaters, the male prostitutes, the homosexual offenders, the greedy, the drunkards, the slanderers, the swindlers \u2013 they won\u2019t inherit the kingdom of God. Don\u2019t deceive yourself. It\u2019s not right.\u201d\n\nRobertson also painted a rosy picture of life for African Americans in Jim Crow-era Louisiana, saying, \u201cI never, with my eyes, saw the mistreatment of any black person.... Pre-entitlement, pre-welfare, you say: Were they happy? They were godly; they were happy; no one was singing the blues.\u201d\n\nWhatever you think of the substance of Robertson\u2019s comments, they weren\u2019t phrased in a way that you would expect would make him a hero to a major social movement. But when A&E briefly suspended Robertson from the show in response to outrage over his comments, he became a convenient martyr to the \u201cChristian persecution\u201d cause.\n\nThe American Family Association launched a petition thanking Robertson for \u201cdeclaring the truth of God\u2019s word.\u201d The National Organization for Marriage started its own petition insisting that \u201cnothing that Phil Robertson said is hateful.\u201d David Barton praised Robertson for making homosexuality seem \u201crepugnant, which is what it should be.\u201d One Republican congressional candidate called Robertson \u201cthe Rosa Parks of our generation.\u201d\n\nThe Religious Right turned its anger on gay rights advocates. AFA President Tim Wildmon asked the group\u2019s members, \u201cWill we capture the energy Phil Robertson has generated and draw on that energy to confront the entrenched fortresses of error and sexual anarchy that now dominate our social landscape?\u201d Americans for Truth About Homosexuality head Peter LaBarbera and the anti-gay group Parents and Friends of Ex-Gays (PFOX) both lamented that Robertson had fallen victim to \u201chomofacism.\u201d The Family Research Council blasted the \u201ctotalitarian tactics of the Left.\u201d Anti-choice activist Janet Porter said that Robertson\u2019s suspension meant that religious faith itself was at risk of \u201cbeing declared unlawful.\u201d Sarah Palin took to Facebook to defend Robertson against the \u201chatin\u2019\u201d of \u201cintolerants,\u201d before admitting that she hadn\u2019t actually read what Robertson said.\n\nOne fringe activist, Theodore Shoebat, even suggested responding to the controversy by imposing the death penalty on homosexuality.\n\nThe Duck Dynasty story fit into a broader right-wing narrative that paints progressive boycotts and pressure campaigns as immoral \u201ceconomic terrorism\u201d while promoting similar campaigns that target companies they perceive as promoting liberal values such as gay rights. In fact, just three months after right-wing groups were expressing righteous indignation about progressives\u2019 \u201ctotalitarian\u201d response to Robertson\u2019s remarks, they cheered Christian radio stations who pulled Christian rocker Dan Haseltine\u2019s music off the air after he announced his support for marriage equality. When some Christian radio stations responded by pulling Haseltine\u2019s group\u2019s music from the air. The Family Research Council and the American Family Association applauded. \u201cDon\u2019t complain when there are consequences for making a foolish declaration like that,\u201d said the AFA\u2019s Bryan Fischer, apparently oblivious to the irony.\n\nEven Todd Starnes, who called a gay-rights boycott of the restaurant chain Chick-fil-A \u201cun-American,\u201d later promoted right-wing boycotts of the Girl Scouts and a barbecue chain restaurant.\n\nOf course, no court has ever found a constitutional right to appear on a reality TV show. And A&E may well have had legitimate business considerations for its move; when Duck Dynasty returned for its next season, its viewership had plummeted. But the story of Phil Robertson fit so well into the Religious Right\u2019s narrative that conservative Christians had become the scrappy underdogs in the \u201cculture war\u201d that it stuck.\n\nA Changing Strategy on Gay Rights\n\nWarnings about the persecution of conservative Christians have gone hand in hand with the rapid success of the gay rights movement in politics, courts and public opinion. This is not a coincidence. Todd Starnes\u2019 myth machine, the perennial \u201cWar on Christmas\u201d and the hero status of the Duck Dynasty clan are useful tools in the effort to reframe every losing policy battle and every shift in public opinion as \u201cpersecution\u201d of the Religious Right.\n\nIn a 2013 report for Political Research Associates, scholar Jay Michaelson documents how the persecution narrative was at the core of religious conservatives\u2019 response to desegregation, the end of school-sponsored school prayer and the victory for abortion rights in Roe v. Wade.\n\nBut nowhere has the Religious Right lost more ground in recent years than on the issue of gay rights.\n\nThe movement\u2019s leaders have portrayed gay rights as the moral test for our time, warning that every advance in the rights of LGBT people detracts from the rights of people who have religious objections to homosexuality.\n\nAs recently as the past decade, opposition to gay rights was a winning issue for the Religious Right. President George W. Bush\u2019s advisors (including former RNC chairman Ken Mehlman, who later came out as gay) helped to get constitutional amendments banning marriage equality on the ballot in 11 states in 2004 an effort to boost conservative turnout.\n\nBut the tide turned quickly.\n\nIn 2010, Congress overturned the ban on military service for openly gay and lesbian Americans. In 2012, voters in four states either passed laws allowing marriage equality or defeated anti-equality measures at the ballot box. In 2013, the Supreme Court struck down the portion of the Defense of Marriage Act that had prohibited the federal government from recognizing legal same-sex marriages, leading federal courts to strike down same-sex marriage bans in several states. Marriage equality is now the law in 19 states and the District of Columbia, and marriage equality lawsuits are pending in dozens more.\n\nAs the anti-gay movement found itself on the defensive, it began to increasingly embrace the \u201creligious liberty\u201d theme. While dire warnings about persecution of conservative Christians have been in the Religious Right\u2019s vocabulary for decades, the success of the gay rights movement has brought them to the center of its strategy.\n\nIn 2006, as public opinion and laws were tilting ever more quickly toward LGBT rights, social conservatives at the annual Values Voter Summit painted a stark dichotomy between gay rights and religious liberty. Alan Sears of the Alliance Defense Fund, now called the Alliance Defending Freedom, one of the largest groups promoting the \u201cChristian persecution\u201d message, told the crowd of activists that \u201cthe homosexual agenda and [freedom of] religion are on a collision course.\u201d Then-Rep. Marilyn Musgrove, Republican of Colorado, warned, \u201cIf we have gay marriage, our religious liberties are gone!\u201d\n\nSubsequent gay rights victories have generated a flurry of apocalyptic rhetoric about a coming crackdown on conservative Christians in America.\n\nReligious Right groups have claimed that efforts to include LGBT people in federal hate-crimes laws are an attempt to \u201ctarget Christians\u201d and \u201csilence\u201d opposition. (Of course, the fact that hate-crimes laws apply only to people who actually commit violent crimes is inevitably left out of this kind of criticism.)\n\nThe repeal of the military\u2019s \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d policy and subsequent efforts to extend benefits to same-sex spouses of service members led to accusations of anti-Christian and even anti-straight discrimination. One Republican in Congress, Rep. Tim Huelskamp of Kansas, went so far as to introduce a bill that he claimed would protect \u201cmilitary religious freedom\u201d by banning chaplains from using military facilities to perform same-sex wedding ceremonies. The bill would have done nothing to protect religious liberty among military clergy, who are not required to perform same-sex marriages. Instead, it would have hampered the free exercise rights of clergy whose beliefs allow or require them to perform same-sex ceremonies.\n\nIn 2012, the American Family Association published an article claiming that \u201cthose who are pushing for the institution of same sex marriage are ipso facto pushing for the elimination of the Christian religion.\u201d\n\nThe next year, as the Supreme Court considered the constitutionality of DOMA and Proposition 8, California\u2019s ban on same-sex marriage, Tea Party Unity and Vision America leader Rick Scarborough speculated that a decision in favor of marriage equality would cause the Obama administration to \u201cround up\u201d and imprison opponents of gay rights. Similarly, Liberty Counsel\u2019s Matt Barber warned that an anti-DOMA ruling would lead to \u201cthe criminalization of Christianity.\u201d Gary Bauer warned that people of faith would soon be \u201cfined or jailed.\u201d\n\nOf course, when the Supreme Court struck down part of DOMA, none of these fears turned out to be founded, but American Family Association spokesman Bryan Fischer still declared that opponents of gay rights had become \u201csecond class citizens and victims of a new \u201cJim Crow.\u201d\n\nAdvances in marriage equality have launched a new front in the anti-gay movement. As the effort to ban marriage equality becomes a losing battle for conservative activists, they\u2019re turning their sights toward legalizing discrimination against LGBT people under the guise of preventing discrimination against Christians.\n\nAs National Organization for Marriage President Brian Brown advised activists on a conference call in April 2014, \u201cWhen [gay-rights activists] bring up discrimination, we need to turn it on its head and say, this is about anti-religious, specifically in some cases, anti-Christian religious bigotry, and there\u2019s no place for this in this country.\u201d Brown called such \u201cdiscrimination\u201d against same-sex-marriage opponents Jim Crow \u201cin reverse.\u201d\n\nIronically, while many Religious Right activists falsely claim that marriage equality laws will require clergy to solemnize same-sex marriages against their will, in at least one state it is a ban on same-sex marriages that is stifling the liberty of pastors. In April 2014, a group of North Carolina pastors and the United Church of Christ sued North Carolina over its constitutional ban on same-sex marriage, citing a law that fines pastors for performing wedding ceremonies without a license from the state. The FRC\u2019s Tony Perkins defended the ban by arguing that the First Amendment\u2019s protection of religious freedom does not apply to Christians who support marriage equality.\n\nThe Religious Freedom Restoration Act and Religion in the Public Square\n\nIn 2009, a coalition of conservative evangelical and Catholic leaders convened to sign the Manhattan Declaration, a manifesto in which they vowed to defy any law that did not comply with their religious beliefs, specifically laws dealing with marriage and reproductive rights. \u201cThe freedom of religion and the rights of conscience are gravely jeopardized by those who would use the instruments of coercion to compel persons of faith to compromise their deepest convictions,\u201d they wrote.\n\nThe declaration\u2019s organizers hoped to gather one million signatures within a month; nearly five years later, they are still more than 400,000 signatures short. But despite the failure to live up to that goal, the declaration still marked an important turning point in the Religious Right\u2019s strategy.\n\nThe Manhattan Declaration was an opportunity for grandstanding, but it was also an important sign of how the Religious Right planned to use the \u201creligious persecution\u201d narrative in policy debates. The declaration made clear that to these leaders, \u201creligious liberty\u201d meant the right to carve out broad exemptions to civil laws, not just for churches and houses of worship (which already enjoy such broad exemptions), but also for individuals and even for-profit businesses \u2013 even when those exemptions come at the expense of the rights of others.\n\nThis redefining of \u201creligious liberty\u201d has come to a head in the struggle over the interpretation of the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act and the passage of similar laws in the states.\n\nIn 1993, President Clinton signed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), a bipartisan bill drafted in response to a Supreme Court decision that eliminated the need for the government to show a \u201ccompelling state interest\u201d in enforcing a law that restricted an individual\u2019s religious freedom. Employment Division v Smith had involved two American Indians were denied state unemployment benefits because they had been fired from their jobs for smoking peyote in a religious ceremony. RFRA garnered broad support from religious and civil liberties groups, including People For the American Way and the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nRFRA was intended to re-establish the legal standard that existed before the Smith ruling. It requires that if a law places a substantial burden on a person\u2019s exercise of religion, the government must demonstrate that the law serves a compelling government interest in the least restrictive way. The Supreme Court later ruled that Congress could only apply RFRA to the federal government, not to the states, leading several states to pass their own versions of the law, many written more broadly than the federal measure.\n\nSince that time, conservative activists wielding religious persecution rhetoric have attempted to broaden the scope of RFRA to not just protect individuals from burdens on religious exercise but to allow individuals and even for-profit corporations to cite religious beliefs in order to discriminate against others. As PRA\u2019s Michaelson puts it, \u201cRFRA demonstrates the pattern of protections for minority religions being subsequently used by majorities.\u201d\n\nIn a number of prominent recent cases, Religious Right activists have pushed state-level \u201creligious freedom\u201d laws for the explicit purpose of allowing businesses to bypass anti-discrimination laws. Although advocates of these laws have hinted that they are ways around anti-discrimination laws that protect LGBT people, many have been written so broadly as to open the door for all manner of discrimination by businesses open to the public.\n\nIn 2012, a coalition of civil rights, religious, law enforcement and child welfare groups successfully urged voters in North Dakota to defeat a ballot measure that would have put overly broad RFRA language into the state constitution. Opponents worried that the measure could have caused chaos in the state\u2019s courts and, in the words of the Bismark Tribune, \u201copened the door for people to use religious beliefs as a defense in breaking laws protecting against abuse, domestic violence and discrimination.\u201d\n\nThe next year Kentucky\u2019s legislature overrode the governor\u2019s veto to put a similarly broad new state RFRA law on the books.\n\nThis year, intensive organizing and education helped stall similar bills in a number of states, including Kansas, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Georgia. Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer vetoed a bill after national attention focused on the state. Among those who had urged her to veto the measure were Arizona business leaders, GOP Sens. John McCain and Jeff Flake, and at least three Republican legislators who had initially voted for the bill.\n\nBy contrast, on April 3, Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant signed a bill that was originally modeled on the extremely expansive Arizona legislation but was modified in the wake of the Arizona controversy. Mississippi\u2019s new law mirrors the federal legislation in some ways, but activists note that Mississippi law defines \u201cperson\u201d to include businesses, so the new state law will apply to corporations as well as private citizens. Last year, Bryant signed another \u201creligious liberty\u201d bill \u2013 one that could give religious cover for anti-gay bullying in public schools.\n\nThis new wave of legislation has come in response to a handful of high-profile cases in which businesses have faced penalties for refusing to provide services for same-sex weddings. But the case that could decide the direction of the religious liberty argument is Hobby Lobby\u2019s challenge to the federal mandate that employer-funded insurance policies cover contraception.\n\nThe attack on the contraception mandate may be the Right\u2019s boldest attempt yet to use the rhetoric of religious liberty and religious persecution to limit the rights of other Americans. Its campaign has also taken advantage of the energy of the anti-government Tea Party, which has mobilized against the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has required businesses with more than 15 employees to provide coverage for contraception since 2000. Similar mandates are in place in 28 states; several were promoted or signed into law by Republicans. One such bill signed by Republican Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas in 2005 provided no exemption for religious-affiliated organizations; yet Huckabee now cites the federal mandate to ask \u201cwhether religious liberty still exists in America.\u201d\n\nWhat changed was the Affordable Care Act\u2019s requirement that insurance plans provide coverage for contraception without copays. When some Catholic groups that had supported the ACA balked, the Obama administration changed the rule to shift the burden of contraception costs onto insurance companies providing plans for religiously affiliated organizations. Then the administration made a further concession, requiring women who work for religiously affiliated groups to buy a separate health care plan to cover contraception.\n\nThe Supreme Court is currently considering whether the Hobby Lobby chain is protected under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act from providing health insurance that includes contraception coverage to its employees. Hobby Lobby\u2019s backers not only want to redefine religious liberty to include employers\u2019 right to impose their own religious views on their employees; they want the court to establish a right to religious liberty for secular for-profit corporations.\n\nA ruling in favor of Hobby Lobby could tip the balance in religious liberty cases in favor of giving individuals and businesses large latitude in bucking any number of popularly passed laws. As Peter Montgomery noted in Right Wing Watch:\n\nDavid Barton, an influential conservative activist who helped write the Republican Party\u2019s 2012 platform, argues that the Bible opposes the minimum wage, unions and collective bargaining, estate taxes, capital gains taxes, and progressive taxation in general. Should a company whose owners share Barton\u2019s views be allowed to ignore laws that protect workers by claiming that those laws violate the company\u2019s religious beliefs?\n\nReligious Freedom For Me, But Not For You\n\nThe goal of the Religious Right\u2019s persecution narrative is not only to carve out broad exemptions to civil laws; many use it to promote policies that suppress the free exercise rights of those who do not share a specific set of conservative Christian values.\n\nRepublican presidential hopefuls flock to events organized by David Lane, a Christian Nationalist who declares \u201cAmerica was founded by Christians, as a Christian nation\u201d and wants to see the Bible used as the \u201cprincipal textbook\u201d in public schools In an op-ed announcing his 2014 election efforts, Lane wrote that activists must \u201cengage the church in a culture war for religious liberty, to restore America to our Judeo-Christian heritage and to re-establish a Christian culture.\u201d It\u2019s no coincidence that Lane can utter a plea for \u201creligious liberty\u201d and assert conservative Christian dominance over other religions in the same sentence. For many in his movement, those two seemingly competing claims are one and the same.\n\nSimilarly, Alabama Supreme Court Justice Roy Moore, speaking in 2012 of the \u201cSharia law bans\u201d that have been passed in seven states and introduced in many more on a wave of anti-Muslim sentiment, said, \u201cChristians are being persecuted while people of a religion foreign to our country are doing what they want.\u201d Moore, who once famously defied a court order to remove a statue of the Ten Commandments from a government building, said that when such an establishment of Christianity is prevented, \u201cfalse religions come in and that\u2019s what\u2019s happening in our country today.\u201d\n\nReligious Right historian and activist David Barton has also made this connection, claiming that the United States\u2019 secular legal system is actually paving the way for the institution of Sharia law.\n\nIn 2012, Rev. Franklin Graham lamented that \u201cpolitical correctness demands tolerance of everything as it panders to the godless values of pluralism, marginalizing and even persecuting men and women of faith.\u201d\n\nRepublican Rep. Vicky Hartzler of Missouri put this into words when she said that the Air Force shouldn\u2019t accommodate \u201cfringe religions\u201d because \u201cChristianity is the main religion in our country.\u201d\n\nFamily Research Council President Tony Perkins articulated this dissonance clearly in a recent discussion of the United Church of Christ\u2019s suit against North Carolina\u2019s same-sex marriage ban. \u201cTrue religious freedom,\u201d he argued, applies only to views \u201cbased on orthodox religious viewpoints.\u201d In his view, clergy who choose to perform same-sex marriages are not covered by religious liberty protections because they do not share Perkins\u2019 view of the Christian faith.\n\nMany of the same groups that warn that America\u2019s Christian \u201cminority\u201d is on the verge of religious persecution have backed efforts to erect very real restrictions on the freedoms of actual religious minorities. Some, like the American Family Association\u2019s Bryan Fischer, flatly claim that First Amendment religious liberty protections don\u2019t apply to non-Christians.\n\nThe Religious Right\u2019s \u201creligious liberty\u201d argument too often translates into an effort to suppress the liberties of people who don\u2019t share their specific religious beliefs: people of other faiths, atheists, women seeking reproductive freedom, LGBT people and Christians who don\u2019t share the Religious Right\u2019s political agenda.\n\nConclusion: Redefining Persecution, Redefining Liberty\n\nReligious liberty is a bedrock American value, cherished on both the right and the left. Courts, lawmakers and the public have struggled throughout our nation\u2019s history to protect the right of every person to exercise his or her own religion without being unduly burdened by the religious expression of another. Laws such as the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act have placed an appropriately strong emphasis on protecting individuals\u2019 religious expression without placing undue burdens on society as a whole.\n\nBut using the resonant rhetoric of religious persecution, bolstered by often-bogus stories of purported anti-Christian activities, the Religious Right has attempted to tip this balance away from pluralism and accommodation to a legal system that allows individuals and businesses to broadly exempt themselves from policies they disagree with \u2013 even when that means trampling on the religious rights of others.\n\nThese are not fears to make light of. Religious freedom is a core constitutional value and a cornerstone of our liberty. But the Religious Right\u2019s narrative of religious persecution is not only far from the truth; in many cases the narrative itself serves to undermine true religious liberty and individual freedom for all.\n\nClick here to download the fully formatted report as PDF document.\n\n\n\n\n\n________________________________________________\n\n\n\n\n\n(Editor's note: This post was originally published on People for the American Way.)", "article_metadata": {"rating": "general", "description": "Religious freedom is a core constitutional value and a cornerstone of our liberty.
