However, it's e-cigarettes' potential danger to children that has recently taken the spotlight. A team of researchers have highlighted the risk of nicotine cartridge poisoning for young children and have suggested ways to make the product more child-safe.\n\nBabies and young children put everything in their mouths. It\u2019s their way of learning about the world around them, and most items are harmless. Unfortunately, e-cigarettes cartridges are not one of these items. According to a recent press release from the British Medical Journal, there has been a \u201cmassive rise\u201d in calls to poison centers related to accidental swallowing of liquid nicotine contained in e-cigarette refill cartridges.\" The risk posed by nicotine liquid to children needs to be recognized, acknowledged, and acted upon by all. This includes public education and legislation to improve the safety profile of e-liquid containers,\" explained the authors of a recent letter on the subject.\n\nA handful of stories describing toddlers swallowing nicotine-filled e-cigarette refill cartridges have graced the newspapers. However, the poison control records show these numbers are much higher than those shown in the headlines and the possible side effects are too drastic to be ignored. \u201cTwo or three drops are enough to cause palpitations, vomiting, dizziness, and high blood pressure,\u201d explained Dr. Sanjay Gupta, a British doctor who treated a child suffering from nicotine poisoning earlier this year and co-author of the case. \u201cIn the worst-case scenario it could kill a very small child who ingests the substance,\u201d Gupta told the Birmingham Mail.\n\nSymptoms of nicotine ingestion, as described in the report, include: burning in the mouth and throat, nausea, vomiting, confusion, dizziness, weakness, and hypersalivation. \"The exploratory nature of young children and the attractive packaging of refills is a dangerous combination likely to lead to a growing incidence of accidental exposure to concentrated nicotine solution,\" the researchers explained.\n\nIn an email, Sanjay told Medical Daily what he and his fellow researchers believe might be effective methods in limiting nicotine cartridges' danger to small children. \u201cAll cartridges, and in particular the e-liquid bottles, could have child-proof lids on them so that it is not easy for children to open them,\u201d explained Gupta, adding that the \u201ce-cigarette industry should be regulated with guidelines and standards to improve safety.\u201d\n\nThe researchers also placed some of the responsibility on parents, suggesting that adults not only be made more aware of the dangers of concentrated nicotine, but that they should also take measures to ensure these cartridges are kept well out of children\u2019s reach. \u201cThese are some of the things which can be done, but I am sure there are other possibilities as well,\u201d Gupta said.\n\nSource: Gutpa S, Gandhi A, Manikonda R.
