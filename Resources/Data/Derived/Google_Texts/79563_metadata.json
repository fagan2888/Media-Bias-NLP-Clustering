Two studies, however, found this to be untrue. In fact, while one found that it had remained about the same, another one found that it had dropped just a bit. Even teens in Oregon, where it was just legalized last month, don\u2019t believe anything will change. And because of this, it should come as no surprise that teen marijuana use all over the country is dropping, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse\u2019s (NIDA) Monitoring the Future study.\n\nThe annual survey conducted by researchers at the University of Michigan looked at 8th, 10th, and 12th graders\u2019 marijuana use among other drugs, such as prescription opioids, cigarettes, alcohol, ecstasy, and synthetic marijuana \u2014 this was the first year e-cigarettes were included, too. In virtually all categories, teen use dropped. When it came to overall marijuana use over the past year, figures dropped from 26 percent in 2013 to 24 percent in 2014 \u2014 the first drop in five years, USA Today reported. Breaking that down, the number of 8th graders using weed remained steady at 6.5 percent, while 16.6 percent of 10th graders and 21.2 percent of 12th graders used it.\n\n\u201cWith the rates of many drugs decreasing, and the rates of marijuana use appearing to level off, it is possible that prevention efforts are having an effect,\u201d said NIDA Director Dr. Nora D. Volkow, in a press release. \u201cIt is now more important than ever for the public health community to continue to educate teens, parents, teachers, community leaders, the media, and health care providers about the specific harms of drug use among teens, whose brains are still developing.\u201d\n\nIf the credit goes to these prevention efforts, then it seems teens are getting the message. These drugs can be harmful if they\u2019re abused. A study from September, for example, found that many teens were using marijuana to cope with their problems, a problem in and of itself, which can lead to dependency and the inability to soberly cope with stress. In August, psychologists led discussions at the American Psychological Association\u2019s annual convention expressing concern about brain scans that found marijuana-using teens had more abnormalities in their brains\u2019 gray matter.\n\nStill, the majority of high school seniors said occasional pot use wasn\u2019t harmful, with only 16.4 percent saying it put the user at a \u201cgreat risk.\u201d This notion is consistent with the rest of the general public\u2019s on marijuana use, when compared to other drugs. It\u2019s possible that teens are just getting smarter about the types of drugs and way in which they use them. Use of synthetic marijuana, a concoction of dried plant material and newly made chemicals, dropped to 5.8 percent from 7.9 percent in 2013 and 11.3 percent in 2012. The drug has been linked to multiple deaths, seizures, and hallucinations.\n\nBut despite drops across the board, there\u2019s obviously still lots of work to do. First and foremost, however, should be encouraging proper work ethic in the school environment. By focusing on this, students are more likely to succeed. And according to a 2007 study from the university, students who have done well by 8th grade are the least likely to initiate drug use. \u201cIt is probably wishful thinking to suppose that reducing adolescent substance use will lead to substantial increases in educational success,\u201d the authors wrote, according to a press release. \u201cRather, whatever can be done to improve the educational successes of children and adolescents will likely have a very valuable additional benefit \u2014 reducing their substance abuse.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "teen, drug, use, fewer, teens, using, marijuana, among, other, prescription, illicit, drugs", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Teen drug use is on the decline, with marijuana use dropping for the first time in five years.", "title": "Teens Aren't Smoking Weed As Much As They Used To", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/teen-drug-use-fewer-teens-using-marijuana-among-other-prescription-illicit-drugs-314526", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/16/teen-drug-use.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Teen drug use is on the decline, with marijuana use dropping for the first time in five years.", "title": "Teens Aren't Smoking Weed As Much As They Used To", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/teen-drug-use-fewer-teens-using-marijuana-among-other-prescription-illicit-drugs-314526", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/16/teen-drug-use.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/16/teen-drug-use.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2014-12-16T14:18:04-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-16T14:18:02-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Teen drug use is on the decline, with marijuana use dropping for the first time in five years."}, "article_summary": "Breaking that down, the number of 8th graders using weed remained steady at 6.5 percent, while 16.6 percent of 10th graders and 21.2 percent of 12th graders used it.\nEver since Colorado and Washington first legalized marijuana in 2012, opponents have worried that it would lead to more use among teens.\nIt\u2019s possible that teens are just getting smarter about the types of drugs and way in which they use them.\nThe annual survey conducted by researchers at the University of Michigan looked at 8th, 10th, and 12th graders\u2019 marijuana use among other drugs, such as prescription opioids, cigarettes, alcohol, ecstasy, and synthetic marijuana \u2014 this was the first year e-cigarettes were included, too.\nEven teens in Oregon, where it was just legalized last month, don\u2019t believe anything will change."}
