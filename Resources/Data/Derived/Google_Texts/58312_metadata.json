(AP) - The Missoula County treasurer is assuring taxpayers that their identities have not been compromised after about 1,180 people got tax notices, along with the names and email addresses of the other people who had requested to be notified when their taxes were due.\n\nCounty treasurer Tyler Gernant said it was a breach of trust, and he assured people there was no additional risk of a data breach.\n\nGernant said tax bills were sent out in October, and some taxpayers were asked to provide their email addresses if they wanted to be reminded when it was time to pay second-half taxes. The emails that included others was inadvertent and the result of a computer mistake, he said.\n\n\u201cObviously that was not our intention,\u201d Gernant said.\n\nHis office sent out an apology, saying he and his staff were \u201ctruly agonizing over our breach of your trust.\u201d\n\nHe urged people to contact his office if they had any problems caused by the mistake, the Missoulian reported (http://tinyurl.com/jnltrbr ).\n\nThe addresses of those who requested the notification were entered by hand into a spreadsheet and sent to the county\u2019s GroupWise email system.\n\nA deputy treasurer mistakenly included the entire group contact list in the message sent to the taxpayers.\n\n\u201cWe had a couple of people who brought it to our attention, and for the most part they were nice,\u201d Gernant said. \u201cWe felt like it was probably necessary to send out the email to say it wasn\u2019t tied to any of our information systems.\n\n\u201cThe only damage would be that somebody saw your email address. I definitely don\u2019t discount that.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Missoulian, http://www.missoulian.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Missoula County treasurer is assuring taxpayers that their identities have not been compromised after about 1,180 people got tax notices, along with the names and email addresses of the other people who had requested to be notified when their taxes were due.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/apr/23/treasurer-says-county-taxpayers-not-at-risk-of-dat/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "The Missoula County treasurer is assuring taxpayers that their identities have not been compromised after about 1,180 people got tax notices, along with the names and email addresses of the other people who had requested to be notified when their taxes were due.", "title": "Treasurer says county taxpayers not at risk of data breach"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "description": "The Missoula County treasurer is assuring taxpayers that their identities have not been compromised after about 1,180 people got tax notices, along with the names and email addresses of the other peop", "card": "summary", "title": "Treasurer says county taxpayers not at risk of data breach"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "County treasurer Tyler Gernant said it was a breach of trust, and he assured people there was no additional risk of a data breach.\nA deputy treasurer mistakenly included the entire group contact list in the message sent to the taxpayers.\nHis office sent out an apology, saying he and his staff were \u201ctruly agonizing over our breach of your trust.\u201dHe urged people to contact his office if they had any problems caused by the mistake, the Missoulian reported (http://tinyurl.com/jnltrbr ).\nThe addresses of those who requested the notification were entered by hand into a spreadsheet and sent to the county\u2019s GroupWise email system.\n(AP) - The Missoula County treasurer is assuring taxpayers that their identities have not been compromised after about 1,180 people got tax notices, along with the names and email addresses of the other people who had requested to be notified when their taxes were due."}
