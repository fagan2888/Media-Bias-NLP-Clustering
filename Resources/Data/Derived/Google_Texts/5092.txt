The presidential exploratory committee of retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson raised more than $2 million in less than a month of activity, his team said Monday.

The $2.1 million total came from about 36,000 new donors, with an average donation of $54.

“This level of grass-roots support during the exploratory committee phase is remarkable, if not unprecedented,” said Barry Bennett, campaign manager for the committee. “To reach this number with only 50 major donors making the maximum contribution shows the enthusiasm that everyday people across the entire country have for Dr. Carson and his common-sense vision for America.”

Mr. Carson is in the early presidential state of New Hampshire Monday.

By comparison, the campaign of Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas has highlighted a Wall Street Journal report that Mr. Cruz raised about $4 million in the eight days after he launched his own presidential campaign last month, though Mr. Cruz bypassed the exploratory phase and went straight into announcing a full-fledged presidential bid.
