U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer, a Republican, said the new regulations could increase annual electric bills by $200 per family and cause the loss of nearly a quarter-million jobs by 2030, according to a study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n\nFischer was one of 47 senators who asked the EPA to extend the comment period for the proposed regulations.\n\nBecause Nebraska is a public power state, Fischer said Nebraska taxpayers could be on the hook twice \u2014 first to pay for the cost of retrofitting power plants and again to pay for the increased cost to power homes and businesses.\n\nThe Nebraska chapter of Americans for Prosperity called on Congress to block the EPA rules.\n\n\u201cNebraskans shouldn\u2019t have to worry about whether they can afford to power their homes in the summer,\u201d said AFP-Nebraska State Director Matt Litt. \u201cWith continued delays on building the Keystone XL pipeline and now Draconian EPA regulations on power plants, the Obama administration clearly has no concern for Nebraska\u2019s energy sector. Empowering bureaucrats in Washington to hike energy costs is the wrong way forward for Nebraska.\u201d\n\nBut Bold Nebraska applauded the president\u2019s \u201cstrong action against the threat of climate change to our health, air and water.\u201d The group advocates against the use of Canada\u2019s tar sands oil and supports using less coal and more renewable energy.\n\n\u201cWe stand with President Obama as he does his part to protect the Heartland\u2019s water and the health of our families,\u201d the progressive group said in a statement Monday.\n\nIf less coal is transported by rail through Nebraska, it would impact the state because the headquarters of Union Pacific railroad is in Omaha, and the state is home to three large switching yards for UP and BNSF Railway. According to the American Railroad Association, coal hauling accounted for nearly 22 percent of all U.S. rail revenue in 2012. The UNL study estimated coal-related rail activity generates $2.9 billion in annual output and creates 6,750 jobs in Nebraska.\n\n\u201cNebraska rail crews are busy operating coal trains and maintaining tracks, thereby supporting Nebraska employment,\u201d the study said.\n\nBut the Democrat running for the U.S. Senate in Nebraska, Dave Domina, applauded the EPA rules, saying they\u2019re flexible and the facts make it clear there\u2019s a need to reduce carbon particles from coal-powered plants.\n\n\u201cThat needs to be done,\u201d Domina said during a Monday debate. \u201cScience is real, and the impact that fossil fuels are having on our environment are real.\u201d\n\nThe Republican Senate nominee, Ben Sasse, disagreed, saying America needs an \u201call of the above\u201d energy strategy rather than making war on industries like coal. The EPA proposal will be \u201cvery destabilizing on Nebraska,\u201d he said.\n\nThis planet was blessed with a variety of energy sources, and Nebraska families are some of the most \u201cenvironmentally serious\u201d people in the nation, Sasse said, because they live off the land. He said he supports the proposed Keystone XL oil pipeline and the extraction of more North American oil and natural gas.\n\n\u201cThe Obama administration doesn\u2019t have an all of the above strategy \u2014 they have a Solyndra Strategy,\u201d Sasse said, referring to a California solar company that went bankrupt despite $529 million in government subsidies.\n\nContact Deena Winter at deena@nebraskawatchdog.org.
