It was an emotional evening capped off by each of the five Seniors being given a framed jersey and a loud ovation.\n\n\"The emotions hit me pretty heavily when I lifted my jersey up and did a 360 looking at the crowd,\" explained Ron Baker. \"It just amazes me how dedicated our fan base is to this program and how they support this program has just been really special. Hardly anybody left until after the five seniors were displayed after today's game. It just shows your fan base is the real deal and they really appreciate greatness.\"\n\nThis class of Seniors, headlined by Baker along with Fred VanVleet and Evan Wessel, will go down as one of the greatest in Shocker basketball history.\n\n\"Just so much work that we've put in and this is the best part about it,\" said VanVleet. \"When you get to experience a day like today it all pays off and it all makes sense. Just looking back on everything we've accomplished, it's pretty special. It's even more special when you look next to you and see a guy that's got your back no matter what.\"\n\nThe group took time to celebrate the big moments and remember the little ones after their final game at the Roundhouse.\n\n\"Just us celebrating on the bench, cheering each other on no matter who is in the game or who is playing, it's those moments that just show how close this team is,\" Wessel explained.\n\nIt's a group of Shockers for the history books, with one more chapter still to be written.\n\nWessel added, \"It's been a lot of great times but at the same time you're still thinking, there's more to come. We're still not finished yet.\"", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "The WSU basketball Senior class was recognized after the game at Koch Arena Saturday night.", "language": "english", "author": "Rachel Kilmer", "og": {"description": "The WSU basketball Senior class was recognized after the game at Koch Arena Saturday night.", "title": "Shocker Seniors say goodbye to Koch Arena", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Shocker-Seniors-say-goodbye-to-Koch-Arena-370439251.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/ABD/B5C/ABDB5CCF0B6C4EC6A2E9A931504CC981", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/EEA/211/EEA211A0C49A4C728C273DB6CE7F42F8.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "The WSU basketball Senior class was recognized after the game at Koch Arena Saturday night.", "title": "Shocker Seniors say goodbye to Koch Arena", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Shocker-Seniors-say-goodbye-to-Koch-Arena-370439251.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/shocker+seniors.jpg", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Shocker Seniors say goodbye to Koch Arena", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Shocker Seniors say goodbye to"}, "article_summary": "\"They're tough, they're passionate, they're leaders, they're winners and they've taken us all on a tremendous ride.\"\nThat's how Gregg Marshall described the Wichita State Seniors after their win over Illinois State Saturday night.\n\"It just amazes me how dedicated our fan base is to this program and how they support this program has just been really special.\nThis class of Seniors, headlined by Baker along with Fred VanVleet and Evan Wessel, will go down as one of the greatest in Shocker basketball history.\nIt was an emotional evening capped off by each of the five Seniors being given a framed jersey and a loud ovation."}
