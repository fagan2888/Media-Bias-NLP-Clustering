Scalia\u2019s tone sets \u201ca terrible example for young lawyers.\u201d\n\nWhile Scalia has \u201clong relied on ridicule,\u201d the justice took it to a new level this term with \u201cespecially nasty, sarcastic and personal\u201d opinions, Chemerinsky wrote.\n\nReferring to Scalia\u2019s critique of the majority opinion in the Obergefell same-sex marriage case, the law dean said: \u201cA litigator who compared an opponent\u2019s brief to a fortune cookie likely would be, and should be, sanctioned by the court.\u201d\n\nBy celebrating Scalia\u2019s acerbic wit, legal professionals risk encouraging a \u201cnew generation of peevish, callous scoffers,\u201d Chemerinsky said.\n\nAsked for examples of his students\u2019 briefs laced with name-calling, Chemerinsky told The College Fix in an email that he does not keep drafts of his students\u2019 work.\n\nThe dean may have himself to blame: Chemerinsky told The Fix he is assigning Scalia\u2019s dissents in class.\n\nAnother possibility is that Chemerinsky is out of touch with youth culture.\n\nRick Garnett, a law professor at Notre Dame, told The Fix in an email that writing on social media already takes an ironic, sarcastic and even nasty tone, and students are accustomed to such language.\n\n\u201cI would imagine Dean Chemerinsky would agree that it would be a good thing if more lawyers could write with Justice Scalia\u2019s skill, even if that meant tolerating a bit of sarcasm,\u201d said Garnett, a contributor to the Catholic legal theory blog Mirror of Justice.\n\nChemerinsky got pushback from another professor, whose letter to the editor of the Times said many students \u201chave for years already seen much more such tone and style [as Scalia\u2019s] in the political rhetoric of their campuses.\u201d\n\nStephen Ball, a philosophy professor at California Polytechnic State University, wrote that he had \u201cdefinitely seen this trend\u201d in his 35 years of teaching in California universities.\n\nSome law students may also find Scalia\u2019s \u201csubstantive positions\u201d attractive and develop their own cynicism \u201cabout the apparent politics of the nation\u2019s highest court,\u201d such as Chief Justice John Roberts\u2019 alleged inconsistencies, Ball said.\n\nThe \u201cpungency\u201d of Scalia\u2019s writing is precisely what makes him \u201cthe Supreme Court\u2019s greatest writer,\u201d according to Jeet Heer, senior editor at The New Republic.\n\nHeer is no conservative pundit: He recently claimed that Dylann Roof, alleged to have killed nine people in a historically black South Carolina church, represents American conservatism.\n\nThe writer nonetheless celebrated Scalia\u2019s style in his dissents in Obergefell and King v. Burwell, whose majority opinion upheld federal subsidies for federally-run healthcare exchanges under Obamacare.\n\nScalia is \u201cthe foremost living practitioner of performative legal prose, a masterful writer who can make torts tarty and judgments jazzy,\u201d Heer wrote.\n\nComparing Scalia to writers including T.S. Eliot and Marcel Proust, Heer said \u201chis puissant language is powered by a terrible sense of longing, a palpable feeling for the world we have lost.\u201d\n\nLike The College Fix on Facebook / Follow us on Twitter\n\nIMAGES: United States Mission Geneva/Flickr, ACLU of Southern California/Flickr", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The College Fix", "description": "Aren't law students already influenced by mean-spirited 'political rhetoric' on their own campuses?", "title": "Justice Scalia is ruining my students because he's too entertaining, law school dean says - The College Fix", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 580, "identifier": "http://www.thecollegefix.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/antoninscalia.United_States_Mission_Geneva.flickr.jpg", "height": 380}, "updated_time": "2015-07-20T02:18:37-04:00", "url": "http://www.thecollegefix.com/post/23412/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.thecollegefix.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/antoninscalia.United_States_Mission_Geneva.flickr.jpg", "description": "Aren't law students already influenced by mean-spirited 'political rhetoric' on their own campuses?", "card": "summary", "title": "Justice Scalia is ruining my students because he's too entertaining, law school dean says - The College Fix"}, "fb": {"admins": "672627547,1540010264,100009162449428", "app_id": 1559699120988871}, "article": {"section": "Featured", "tag": "UC-Irvine", "published_time": "2015-07-20T01:38:01-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-20T02:18:37-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the University of California-Irvine\u2019s law school, is speaking out against the allure of Scalia\u2019s writing style to his own students.\nAnother professor wishes more law students had Scalia\u2019s skillThe Supreme Court\u2019s most sarcastic justice couldn\u2019t convince most of his colleagues that the U.S. Constitution does not require same-sex marriage, but he\u2019s allegedly influential with an unexpected group: law students.\nThe \u201cpungency\u201d of Scalia\u2019s writing is precisely what makes him \u201cthe Supreme Court\u2019s greatest writer,\u201d according to Jeet Heer, senior editor at The New Republic.\nThe dean may have himself to blame: Chemerinsky told The Fix he is assigning Scalia\u2019s dissents in class.\nSome law students may also find Scalia\u2019s \u201csubstantive positions\u201d attractive and develop their own cynicism \u201cabout the apparent politics of the nation\u2019s highest court,\u201d such as Chief Justice John Roberts\u2019 alleged inconsistencies, Ball said."}
