As Obama\u2019s chief campaign adviser in 2008, Axelrod directed the campaign that put the first black president in office, and then went on to become Obama\u2019s senior adviser during his first administration. Now, he\u2019s pulling the tarp off of it all in his new memoir, \u201cBeliever: My Forty Years in Politics.\u201d\n\nAs President Obama defies criticism of a lame-duck presidency through a slew of executive actions and an assertive State of the Union speech, Axelrod sheds new light on how the President got to this point. From meeting Obama in Chicago to working on his reelection campaign in 2012, Axelrod shaped Obama\u2019s trajectory through messaging, coordination, debate prep, and more.\n\nDoes David Axelrod\u2019s memoir give a more complex understanding of President Obama? Can the politics be separated from the man? And how will this book shape the narrative for Obama\u2019s legacy and 2016?\n\nGuest:\n\nDavid Axelrod, Former Senior Advisor to President Barack Obama; Former Senior Strategist to President Obama's 2012 re-election campaign and then-Senator Obama's 2008 presidential campaign; author of the new book, \u201cBeliever: My Forty Years in Politics\u201d (Penguin Press, 2015); and Director of the Institute of Politics at the University of Chicago", "article_metadata": {"author": "Southern California Public Radio", "og": {"site_name": "Southern California Public Radio", "description": "David Axelrod has seen a side of President Barack Obama about which most of us can only speculate.", "title": "David Axelrod stops by to reflect on his political career", "url": "http://www.scpr.org/programs/airtalk/2015/02/17/41584/david-axelrod-stops-by-to-reflect-on-his-political/", "image": {"width": 1024, "identifier": "http://a.scpr.org/i/96d80a22cfb47c79d85885e61e5dd92d/100255-full.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 605}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "http://scpr.org", "description": "Member-supported public radio for Southern California.
