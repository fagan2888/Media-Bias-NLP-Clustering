A deficit in its annual budget of about $7 billion may more than triple to $833 million in the next fiscal year, according to the agency, which runs 11 hospitals.\n\nHundreds of thousands of the uninsured, undocumented patients it treats aren\u2019t covered by the Affordable Care Act, HHC President Ramanathan Raju told the city council in May. The agency will continue to need funding to support the cost of serving those patients and to cover other shortfalls caused by inadequate reimbursement, he said.\n\nBellevue is treating physician Craig Spencer, 33, who tested positive for Ebola after being returning from aid work in West Africa, is being treated in an isolation unit at Bellevue.\n\nHHC is familiar with financial and operational challenges. It\u2019s historically been the \u201cdumping grounds\u201d for patients in bad shape both socially and medically, said Charles Brecher, consulting research director of the Citizens Budget Commission, a business-backed watchdog, and long-time observer of the municipal hospital system.\n\nAIDS Experience\n\nBellevue was a primary center for care during the AIDS crisis in the 1980s, which gives it an advantage during the current virus emergency, Brecher said.\n\n\u201cThe importance of their role in this situation gives them some sense of support,\u2019\u2018\u2019 said Brecher, adding that HHC can tap into reserves. \u2018\u2018They\u2019re as well-equipped as anybody to deal with it.\u201d\n\nHHC was created in 1969 to take over the operations of the city\u2019s public hospitals and improve management and staffing. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani was unsuccessful in taking some of its operations private because it couldn\u2019t function without public subsidies, Brecher said.\n\nMayor Michael Bloomberg increased spending on the hospitals, stabilized leadership and improved the quality of care, Brecher said. Bloomberg is the founder and majority owner of Bloomberg News parent Bloomberg LP.\n\nBulging Deficit\n\nHHC\u2019s deficit is growing even after it saved $600 million annually by freezing hiring in 2010 and cutting 3,700 positions, mostly through attrition, and restructuring operations.\n\nSince 2008, HHC has lost more than $540 million a year because of cuts to Medicaid reimbursement rates. Pension and employee health-care costs have increased by $680 million since July 2001, Raju\u2019s predecessor, Alan Aviles, said in February.\n\nAbout 80 percent of HHC\u2019s patients are on Medicaid, the federal-state health insurance program for the poor, or are uninsured, according to HHC.\n\nRaju, a surgeon by training and former director of the Cook County, Illinois, public hospital system, was hired by de Blasio in January. Before going to Chicago, Raju served as HHC\u2019s executive vice president for operations and also as chief medical officer.\n\nHHC has planned for Ebola for more than two-and-a-half months, sending \u201csecret shopper\u201d patients simulating suspicious symptoms to test screening protocols. It also conducted drills to practice putting on and taking off of protective gear, Raju said yesterday at an HHC board meeting.\n\nNew York state received a Medicaid waiver this year that will bring an estimated $8 billion in federal funding to the state over the next five years if performance targets are met. Most of the money is for changing the delivery of health care.\n\nIf performance targets aren\u2019t met, the money will be reduced, Raju said. HHC is submitting its application for funds in December.\n\nThe HHC system also includes Coney Island Hospital in Brooklyn, Jacobi Medical Center in the Bronx and Queens Hospital Center.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Martin Z.
