In a separate study, 80 percent of non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma patients saw positive results from the same treatment \u2013 while half reported their symptoms completely disappeared, Fox News reported.\n\nThe \u2018Stop Hillary\u2019 campaign is on fire!

The molecules, which are chimeric antigen receptors, or CARS, then go to work and limit the ability of cancer cells to ward off the body\u2019s natural immune system.\n\nIt\u2019s almost like reprogramming the immune system, medical officials said.\n\nGET FREE E-BOOK RIGHT NOW!

Two of those patients then died, Fox News reported.\n\nBut medical officials are hopeful the treatment could prove a viable option for certain types of cancers.\n\n\u201cMuch like chemotherapy and radiotherapy, it\u2019s not going to be a save-all,\u201d Riddell said, in Fox News. \u201c[But] I think immunotherapy has finally made it to a pillar of cancer therapy.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "Scientists seeking a cure for cancer say they\u2019ve found early trials of one treatment that sends in modified white blood cells to fight off certain types of the disease have produced \u201cextraordinary\u201d success, with 94 percent of participants in one study seeing a complete disappearance of their symptoms.
