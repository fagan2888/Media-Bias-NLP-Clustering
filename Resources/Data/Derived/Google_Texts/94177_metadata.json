At 84, the question of succession looms large. Would the company survive if Warren Buffett decides to step down? Cunningham thinks the company is built to last. Here\u2019s an excerpt adapted from his book.\n\nJust how huge is Berkshire Hathaway? If it were a country and its revenues its gross domestic product, the company would be among the world\u2019s top 50 economies, rivaling Ireland, Kuwait and New Zealand. Berkshire\u2019s cash alone \u2013 $40 billion or more in recent years \u2013 exceeds the total assets of all but the largest 100 American corporations.\n\nBerkshire\u2019s substantial achievements over a sustained period of time are well known. The company and its iconic leader, Warren E. Buffett, became famous for savvy stock picking through the 1990s. They acquired lucrative minority stakes in public companies, including American Express, Coca-Cola, the Washington Post Company and Wells Fargo. Today the huge Berkshire conglomerate has wholly owned businesses in every artery of commerce, finance and marketing.\n\n\n\nRelated: Warren Buffett\u2019s Secret Weapon for Success\n\nBerkshire owns the second most popular car insurer in the United States (GEICO), one of the major trans-continental railroads in North America (Burlington Northern Santa Fe), two of the biggest reinsurers in the world (Gen Re and National Indemnity), a global energy supplier (Berkshire Hathaway Energy, formerly MidAmerican Energy), and pacesetters in fields as different as diamonds and mobile homes.\n\nAll of this is why, when IBM and Coke, two of Berkshire\u2019s biggest investments, fell short of earnings expectations in late October and \u201ccost\u201d the company about $2.5 billion, garnering a great deal of media attention \u2013 I doubted that Buffett lost any sleep over those market events.\n\nMost people assume that if the price of a stock they own falls, they\u2019ve lost money. But Buffett and other value investors don\u2019t think the way most people think.\n\nRelated: How the Right Corporate Culture Can Guarantee Success\n\nThe value investor\u2019s creed holds that a price decline of a stock you own and like is often not remotely a loss, but an investment opportunity. It\u2019s related to price and value being different things. The $2.5 billion figure in terms of Buffett\u2019s recent losses was the price decline in the stocks. It\u2019s not the same as the relative value of the underlying businesses.\n\nHere\u2019s a quick primer of value investing to put the story about Berkshire\u2019s stock positions in perspective:\n\n(A) Price and value are different (so Berkshire did not \u201close\u201d anything when\n\nprices of stocks such as Coca-Cola or IBM tumbled recently);\n\n(B) If the economic characteristics of a business have permanently eroded, sell the stock (which is why Berkshire recently sold half its stake in Tesco); and\n\n(C) Shareholder activists who interfere with management may obtain short-term gains from a given stake \u2013 but sacrifice potential value that a partnership attitude yields. For example, Berkshire\u2019s 2008 investments in Bank of America, GE, Goldman and others were spectacularly profitable because investees valued its patient quiet capital.\n\nRelated: Guess How Much Money Warren Buffett Made in 2013?\n\nOverall, Berkshire has outperformed the broader stock market for its shareholders 80 percent of the time, often by double digits. Through 2013, Berkshire\u2019s average annual gain was 19.7 percent, more than double that of the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index, a cross-section of public company stocks. With a market value of $300 billion, Berkshire has generated considerable wealth, direct and indirect, for employees, customers, suppliers and other constituencies.\n\nThis past Friday, Berkshire posted third-quarter earnings of $2,876 per share, topping estimates of $2,594 per share. The company said operating earnings rose to $4.72 billion, up 29 percent from a year ago, while net income fell nearly 9 percent in the same period, to $4.62 billion.\n\nBut how does it function so successfully given that it is made up of a diverse group of subsidiaries? Besides a portfolio of minority interests in scores of public companies, Berkshire wholly owns 50 significant direct subsidiaries, which in turn own another 200 subsidiaries. The Berkshire corporate empire encompasses more than 500 entities engaged in hundreds of different lines of business.\n\nAs someone who has long studied the company, I can tell you that its distinctive features are tailor-made for its special circumstances. Berkshire boasts an atypical shareholder body that relishes the company\u2019s distinctiveness \u2013 and one that understands that corporate culture matters.\n\nSo what lessons can others take away from Berkshire?\n\nRelated: 7 Ways to Fix Your Biggest Management Mistake\n\nBerkshire\u2019s secret to managing a large complex organization is to manage parsimoniously \u2013 as little as possible. There are no organizational charts, budget reviews, deal pitches, human resources management, or present value analysis or other business school staples at Berkshire. Instead, it goes by these fundamentals:\n\nBe budget conscious, especially by cost minimization. This underlies the business model at GEICO, for example, where low prices multiple volume and profits. A related implication: Avoid costly debt.\n\nReinvest profits in promising businesses; but avoid adding capital to businesses that don\u2019t generate high returns. A residual point: Commit to permanence but know when to walk away, as Buffett shuttered the mills of Berkshire Hathaway in the 1980s.\n\nNurture entrepreneurship, where rewards can be great, as evidenced by the multiple revenue streams Clayton Homes built around the manufactured housing business.\n\nRelated: The Worst Mistake America\u2019s CEOs Make\n\nEncourage small businesses to grow and expand one step at a time, even if haphazardly, as the accumulation of individual achievement can add up to huge enterprises, like the many success stories in building Dairy Queen.\n\nBut also stick to your knitting, as BNSF Railway has done for a century and a half, and as other Berkshire subsidiaries teach by their mistaken diversions, such as GEICO offering credit cards to insurance customers.\n\nOffer autonomy to business teammates, as they are likely to thrive on it. And have their backs. But do not allow anyone to damage business reputation, being ruthless with managers who skate close to the edge of thin ice.\n\nFor family businesses, address the inherent vexing challenges by promoting the values of family identity and legacy. Family businesses sold to Berkshire \u2013 among them See\u2019s, Nebraska Furniture Mart, and Helzberg Diamonds, for example \u2013 all boast strong cultures that likely would have sustained the companies absent of Berkshire.\n\nMake money, lots of money, but without losing sight of the long term. Manage knowing that people value intangibles, especially permanence, as seen in numerous Berkshire acquisitions made at discounts to business value: most of the family companies; all those acquired out of bankruptcy, such as Fruit of the Loom and Johns Manville; and several others, including Dairy Queen and NetJets.\n\nAbove all, stress integrity, which is central to so many Berkshire stories. Warren Buffett, above all, has made his word his bond.\n\nExcerpted from Berkshire Beyond Buffett: The Enduring Value of Values by Lawrence A. Cunningham. Copyright \u00a9 2014 Lawrence A.
