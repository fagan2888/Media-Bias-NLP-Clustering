Republican Governor-Elect Matt Bevin was able to secure his victory due in part to northern Kentucky's rural counties.

Another 400,000 Kentuckians got free health insurance through the state's Medicaid program after Beshear expanded it to make more people eligible.

Beshear said scrapping the program would make no sense.

"We are well on our way to achieving our goal of ensuring that even our most vulnerable citizens have the benefit of affordable health care", Luallen said.

Beshear also said the growth of revenue as a result of additional jobs and goods is an estimated $246.8 million. The federal exchange is paid for with a 3.5 percent tax on insurance premiums, but it is applied only to plans sold on the exchange. Bevin spokeswoman Jessica Ditto said Bevin's team made the change after a reporter asked about the language. Ralph Alvarado, the first Hispanic member of the Kentucky state Senate.

Beshear, a Democrat who authorized kynect and the Medicaid expansion under the law known as Obamacare, appeared with Lt. Gov. Crit Luallen, the chair of an oversight group called kyhealthnow.

Luallen used the occasion to issue the final report of kyhealthnow, which was created to monitor the health status of Kentuckians during Beshear's tenure.

Beshear said critics of health care reform should read independent studies by health providers and health policy experts.

Using first-year figures, the updated study predicted a $30 billion positive impact on Kentucky's economy over eight years because of that expansion.

Repealing Medicaid expansion would blow a massive hole in the state's budget, imposing a negative fiscal impact of up to $919 million over the next few years.

"This is a long-term plan for improving Kentucky, but you won't see it if you're blinded by short-term political ambitions", he said.

"Contrary to what the people without the facts say, we can afford it", Beshear said.
