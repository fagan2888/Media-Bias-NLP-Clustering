Mary Sue McClurkin (R) during a House Ways and Means Committee meeting in January\n\nOn Tuesday, a panel of Alabama lawmakers advanced four stringent anti-abortion bills that would prevent women in the state from exercising their reproductive rights. The proposed legislation would ban abortions after just six weeks; force women to wait 48 hours before getting an abortion; make it more difficult for minors to end an unwanted pregnancy; and impose more emotional trauma on women who choose to have an abortion after discovering lethal fetal abnormalities.\n\nThe ACLU\u2019s associate advocacy and policy council, Hayley Smith, told ThinkProgress that Alabama\u2019s current assault on reproductive rights is moving at \u201can alarmingly fast pace.\u201d And that assault includes one of the harshest abortion bans in the nation \u2014 a so-called \u201cheartbeat bill\u201d to outlaw abortion as soon as a fetal heartbeat can be detected, which can occur before women even realize they\u2019re pregnant.\n\nState officials are already warning that the heartbeat bill will provoke an immediate legal challenge. But the lawmaker who proposed the six-week abortion ban, Rep. Mary Sue McClurkin (R), is unperturbed. \u201cI\u2019m not really concerned about the challenges. We\u2019ve had challenges before. We wouldn\u2019t have some of the things we have now if it hadn\u2019t been for Brown versus Board of Education,\u201d McClurkin told a local ABC News affiliate, referring to the landmark court ruling that desegregated schools.\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise that this public official would equate her quest to ban abortion with the civil rights movement. McClurkin, who is perhaps the most ardently anti-abortion state lawmaker in Alabama, has a long history of pushing policies to undermine reproductive health. Here are some of her other greatest hits:\n\nShe believes women don\u2019t need abortion access because they shouldn\u2019t be having sex in the first place.\n\nLike most lawmakers who put forth heartbeat bills, McClurkin isn\u2019t concerned that her legislation may prevent women from being able to exercise their constitutionally protected right to end a pregnancy. She has conceded that her bill will end up banning most abortions in the state. But she believes that women simply shouldn\u2019t be sexually active if they are not prepared to have a baby. \u201cI do want life to be the choice the woman chooses because she has a choice before she even participates in something that would lead to the life of a person,\u201d she said this week.\n\nLast year, she claimed a baby is \u201cthe largest organ in the body.\u201d\n\nMcClurkin made national headlines last year after making some unusual comments about anatomy. \u201cWhen a physician removes a child from a woman, that is the largest organ in a body. That\u2019s a big thing. That\u2019s a big surgery. You don\u2019t have any other organs in your body that are bigger than that,\u201d she said to justify her support for additional restrictions on abortion providers. That statement seems to undermine the anti-choice community\u2019s position that fetuses are distinct people that deserve all the rights of U.S. citizenship. It\u2019s also factually incorrect; the largest organ in the body is the skin.\n\nShe championed harsh restrictions on abortion providers that threaten to close down Alabama\u2019s clinics.\n\nMcClurkin made her controversial organ statements while advocating for a measure to indirectly restrict women\u2019s abortion access by targeting abortion clinics. She spearheaded that legislation, which successfully passed last year despite the fact that Planned Parenthood warned it would \u201cessentially ban abortion statewide.\u201d Several reproductive health organizations sued to overturn that harsh law, and it\u2019s currently blocked from taking effect. McClurkin says she considers that legislation to be one of her greatest accomplishments.\n\nShe serves on the leadership team of the National Pro-Life Women\u2019s Caucus.\n\nSusan B. Anthony List, the conservative organization that works to re-brand abortion restrictions as a feminist issue, convened the National Pro-Life Women\u2019s Caucus to help encourage anti-choice women to run for office, as well as help them pass new laws in this area. McClurkin is one of the members of that caucus\u2019 leadership team. The organization is pleased that McClurkin sponsored Alabama\u2019s bill to crack down on abortion clinics.\n\nShe helps ALEC push its economic policy.\n\nMcClurkin is also affiliated with the American Legislative Exchange Council, or ALEC, the right-wing group that coordinates conservative legislation across different states. She serves as a member of ALEC\u2019s Tax and Fiscal Policy Commission, which drafts model bills to kill carbon taxes, shrink pensions, and expand predatory debt collectors\u2019 authority. ALEC is perhaps most notorious for pushing \u201cStand Your Ground\u201d laws, like the one in Florida that allowed George Zimmerman to escape criminal charges for shooting and killing Trayvon Martin exactly two years ago.\n\nShe\u2019s retiring at the end of this term, but will remain known as the \u201cqueen of pro-life legislation.\u201d\n\nThis past fall, McClurkin announced that she plans to retire after serving 16 years in Alabama\u2019s legislature. During an anti-choice rally this week, Alabama House Speaker Mike Hubbard (R) noted that she will be sorely missed. \u201cThere is one that stands up above all the rest. She has been a stalwart for Pro-Life. That is Mary Sue McClurkin of Shelby County,\u201d Hubbard told a crowd of abortion opponents. \u201cWe are going to miss you in the legislature, but that fight for life will continue in the Alabama legislature.\u201d At the same rally, one of the Republican contenders to fill McClurkin\u2019s seat called her the \u201cqueen of pro-life legislation.\u201d\n\nHer proudest moment in office was sneaking a forced ultrasound bill past a Democratic House.\n\nIn a recent interview regarding her plan to retire, McClurkin noted that she\u2019s proud of all the abortion restrictions she helped pass. But one in particular stands out in her mind: the \u201cWomen\u2019s Right To Know Act,\u201d a law that passed in 2002 requiring women to look at an ultrasound image before proceeding with an abortion. \u201cIt passed in the last few minutes of the legislative session. I had to cloture my own bill because the time was running out,\u201d McClurkin recalled. \u201cI hardly even knew what a cloture motion was, I had only seen other people do it. It was a miracle that happened with the Democrats in control. Steve Windom was Lt. Gov. at the time, and he made sure the Senate concurred with our bill as the clock ran out. Then Gov. Siegelman signed it into law.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Mary Sue McClurkin, known as the \"queen of pro-life legislation,\" is behind the recent push to make it impossible for Alabama women to exercise their reproductive rights.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Mary Sue McClurkin, known as the \"queen of pro-life legislation,\" is behind the recent push to make it impossible for Alabama women to exercise their reproductive rights.", "title": "Meet The Lawmaker Who\u2019s Trying To End Abortion In Alabama", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/02/26/3333611/alabama-abortion-lawmaker/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/mary-sue.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Mary Sue McClurkin, known as the \"queen of pro-life legislation,\" is behind the recent push to make it impossible for Alabama women to exercise their reproductive rights.", "title": "Meet The Lawmaker Who\u2019s Trying To End Abortion In Alabama", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/mary-sue-321x214.jpg", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/mary-sue.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/mary-sue.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-26T15:13:57+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf203\"", "article_summary": "McClurkin made her controversial organ statements while advocating for a measure to indirectly restrict women\u2019s abortion access by targeting abortion clinics.\nHealth Meet The Lawmaker Who\u2019s Trying To End Abortion In Alabama CREDIT: AP Photo/Butch Dill Alabama Rep.
