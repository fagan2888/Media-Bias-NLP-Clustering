Dr. Ben Carson is no stranger to controversy. A week ago he accused the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) of unfairly targeting him because of his views on Affordable Care Act. Now, he’s comparing the Obama administration’s healthcare reforms to slavery.

"You know Obamacare is really I think the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery," Carson said Friday during a speech at the Values Voter Summit. "And it is in a way, it is slavery in a way, because it is making all of us subservient to the government, and it was never about healthcare. It was about control."

Carson went on to say that slavery was a “clear evil,” as is the Affordable Care Act because it “is going to have a negative impact on everything in our society.”

Carson is a retired neurosurgeon who was the director of pediatric surgery at Johns Hopkins Children’s Hospital. He was recently hired as a contributor at the conservative Fox News network, but according to The Hill, Carson may have his eyes set on the U.S. presidency.

"[Running for president] is not something I have any desire to do whatsoever, but I certainly listen,” said Carson. "If the circumstances were to evolve in such a way that that seemed to be what God was calling me to do, I would certainly do it. And I would never turn my back on my fellow citizens, if there was a hue and cry for such.”
