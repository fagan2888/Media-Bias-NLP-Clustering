Jeff Nicholson\n\nFor over ten years, Deacon Gray has mentored young comics as the New Talent Coordinator at Comedy Works. Under his stewardship, the scene has flourished, with hundreds of new comics flooding the stage, eager to test their mettle and benefit from Gray's experience. One of the blessings of a career in standup is being part of the small but fiercely loyal community of comics sharing the same journey; when one of our own is down, the shock reverberates through the scene and comedians scramble to help out. So when Gray was diagnosed with oral cancer in December, the local scene scrambled for ways to help, from hosting benefit shows and passing around donation buckets to help deal with Gray's expenses, to offering him rides to and from the Rocky Mountain Cancer Center in a tremendous outpouring of support. Now that the course of Gray's treatment is mostly completed and recovery is within sight, he's ready to take the stage again and will do so in grand fashion this Sunday, March 1, at \"The Answer to Cancer: A Comedy Roast,\" an evening of cathartic entertainment featuring a dais full of Denver's best comics and cancer itself in the hot seat, all in Gray's home club, Comedy Works. In advance of this showcase, Westword caught up with Gray to discuss the final stages of his treatment, returning to the stage after such a long absence, and his gratitude for Obamacare and the health-care professionals who treated him.\n\nWestword: So, you did Freak Train last night to warm up? Was that your first set back?\n\nDeacon Gray: That\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve been onstage since my birthday, which was December 29.\n\nOh man. So compared to since you started doing standup, has that been your longest stretch you\u2019ve gone with getting up onstage?\n\nYeah, that was a long time.\n\nWas that one of the more frustrating parts of going through this treatment?\n\nDefinitely. Feeling like I couldn\u2019t get onstage because my voice would give out, or I would start choking.\n\nOh, god.\n\nOne of the biggest problems I had was what they call mucositis, which meant I always had a tons of like, bile in my throat.\n\nEnough to choke on.\n\nI couldn\u2019t sleep at night. There were nights when I\u2019d sleep like an hour or half an hour and I\u2019d have to get up and clear my throat. So the last couple weeks were really hard. But now I\u2019m two weeks out and things are drying up. The only thing that\u2019s frustrating now is that I can\u2019t eat yet. I\u2019m still on a feeding tube because my tastebuds haven\u2019t come back So everything I eat still tastes kinda meh. But man, I am craving food.\n\nIt\u2019s got to be rough to still have your olfactory senses taunting you.\n\nOh, yeah. Everything else works great. It\u2019s just that I can\u2019t taste anything. I keep trying stuff, like I have a whole refrigerator full of little soft foods, and every morning I try something. It\u2019ll be like, \u201cMaybe I can do pudding?\u201d and then it still tastes like crap.\n\nDo you have any idea what the recovery window for that will be?\n\nThey said two to four weeks. I\u2019m at two weeks, so now it\u2019s just waiting, you know? It\u2019s so frustrating. I\u2019m eating a plain slushy right now. Thank God for Sonic, they\u2019ve kept me hydrated throughout this whole thing.\n\nTheir slushed ice does have a certain consistency.\n\nIt\u2019s perfect. It fools my throat completely. It just slides down and it\u2019s so good.\n\nThere\u2019s an unexpected endorsement.\n\nThe people at Sonic must be freaking out because I buy like four of them at a time. They\u2019ve gotta be like, \u201cWho\u2019s that guy who\u2019s always getting the plain slushies?\u201d It\u2019s the consistency that makes it so good. I\u2019ve got two more of these in my freezer, and I\u2019ll get some more on my way to the clinic tomorrow.\n\nSo, how\u2019d it feel to perform again last night? Did it feel like people were happy to see you back?\n\nIt went really, really well. I was running cancer-specific material.\n\nI was going to ask, how much material have you been sitting on, having it burning a hole in a hole in your jokebook?\n\nI did about six minutes last night and it was all cancer jokes. I\u2019m pretty happy with them and I have other ideas that I need to explore for a bit, but I\u2019m pretty happy with where it\u2019s going. The hard part is convincing people that it\u2019s gonna be funny.\n\nThat it\u2019s okay for them to laugh?\n\nWhen I come out and say, \u201cHey, let\u2019s all laugh at cancer!\u201d people are all like \u201cwhaaat?\u201d It\u2019s a hard topic to broach. Once they realize that you\u2019re not being disrespectful, that you\u2019re not trying to make light of people with cancer \u2014because I\u2019m definitely not\u2014 they tend to go along. And the people who\u2019ve gone through it \u2014which is a lot of people\u2014 they really appreciate it. They came up to me after the show and told me, \u201cYou kind of took the sting out of it.\u201d That\u2019s what I\u2019m hoping to do with these jokes and this show.\n\nDid writing the jokes help take the sting out it for you?\n\nEverything helped. Everything helped. I was lucky. I didn\u2019t have a very \u2014I don\u2019t even know how to say this\u2014 I didn\u2019t have a very bad form of cancer. I mean, all cancer is bad, but compared to some of the people that I would see at the cancer center, it wasn\u2019t that bad. I\u2019m sure that everybody who goes to the cancer center does that. The first week I was there, I sat down on a bench next to a guy who had liver cancer, which is the same kind that killed Bill Hicks. And he was positive. He told me, \u201cThings are going great!\u201d \u2014 and meanwhile, he\u2019s got nine months to live. Liver cancer is one of the worst kinds, you know? But he\u2019d seen someone who had it worse than him, so he thought, \u201cOkay, compared to that guy, I\u2019m doing good.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s like the opposite of how comedians think.\n\nIt really is. But there were a lot of things that made me think I had it light. I didn\u2019t have to put on a robe because they were only treating my throat, so just a T-shirt was fine.\n\nYou posted some pictures of that weird futuristic mask you had to wear for treatments.\n\nI\u2019m bringing the mask to the show on Sunday. You know how during a roast the roastee is on stage the whole time? So I\u2019m going to put the mask in a chair and then I\u2019m going to have an IV bottle draining into. I may even write \u201ctwo drink minimum\u201d on the bottle.\n\nThat\u2019s awesome.\n\nBut yeah, compared to other people, I feel like I got off easy. Obviously, it\u2019s not something I\u2019d want to go through again. Hopefully I\u2019m past it now.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to say for sure, right?\n\nWell, the kind I had, they say oral cancer, but specifically it was cancer of the tonsil. It\u2019s one of the few types where after two years of me going in for check-ups once a month, if there\u2019s no recurrence, they\u2019ll be able to say I\u2019m cured. With a lot of forms of cancer, you can\u2019t really say it\u2019s ever \u201ccured.\u201d\n\nYeah, usually remission is the best you can hope for. So, does it give you some peace of mind to know that there\u2019s that possible goalpost in the future?\n\nYeah. And the fact that they just took one tonsil, and there was no sign that cancer had spread to the other tonsil or my tongue and throat, that gave me a lot of hope. We caught it very, very early.\n\nPart of the focus of Sunday\u2019s show is to draw some attention to health-care professionals, right?\n\nYou know, the whole time that they were taking care of me I was trying to think of ways that I could do something for them. Because, God, just the infinite patience these people have, and the tenderness and care that they give you is unbelievable. I\u2019ve been wanting to do something for those guys so badly. That\u2019s why the show\u2019s on Sunday. Most of them work Monday through Friday, so it\u2019s a chance for them to go out. It\u2019s early enough \u2014the show\u2019s at 7 \u2014 so they can come see the show and still be home by 9 p.m. I\u2019m hoping a lot of them come. They sent an e-mail to all the Rocky Mountain Cancer Centers, so I\u2019m hoping we get a lot of medical people. I can\u2019t do enough for them. On my last day, I took slushies in for all the radiologists.\n\nposter design by Jordan Wieleba\n\nFlavored ones?\n\nYeah, they got good ones. Strawberry, grape. I brought cupcakes to everybody on my last day of chemo. I\u2019m so grateful for them. Here\u2019s another sort of strange thing: This is the first time I\u2019ve ever written a letter to a standing president.\n\nReally?\n\nIf it hadn\u2019t been for Obamacare, I would\u2019ve been screwed. Totally screwed. Having it just made it affordable and easy for me.\n\nComedians don\u2019t typically get a lot of benefits.\n\nActually, this is the first time in my life as a comedian that I\u2019ve had any healthcare. It\u2019s so amazing. If you know anyone who says, \u201cObamacare sucks,\u201d you can tell them it literally saved my life. So yeah, I wrote a letter to Mr. Obama to thank him very, very much.\n\nSo, who do you have lined up for Sunday night?\n\nIt\u2019s still evolving, but I can give you the basics. It\u2019s gonna be hosted by Dr. Kevin Fitzgerald, who\u2019s had his own struggles with cancer. George McClure, Phil Palisoul and Nora Lynch had family members with cancer. Ben Roy has been great, and we just added Adrian Mesa. We may add Rick Bryan because he's been through treatment. I tried to get comics who had some connection to it, people that have had cancer touch their life in some way.\n\nHow\u2019s the roast format going to work?\n\nIt\u2019s supposed to be a roast format, but we\u2019re roasting cancer so it\u2019s not traditional. Usually at a roast, you\u2019re roasting each other. I\u2019m sure some potshots will be taken, but the main focus of the night is to put on a good show for the medical people. Not just them, anybody who has gone through cancer, either as a patient or if they had a family member with it, the show\u2019s for them, too. I\u2019ve had a lot of people contact me saying, \u201cMy dad had throat cancer and I\u2019m bringing him to the show.\u201d We just want to take the sting out of it, show support and I hate to say \u201cinspire people,\u201d but we can at least try to show them that there\u2019s hope and there\u2019s life after this diagnosis.\n\nThat catharsis must be so important. To be able to laugh when you\u2019re terrified?\n\nYeah, that\u2019s definitely it. You know, the first week was the hardest for me. I got the diagnosis on December 2. That was the hardest week because you\u2019re so scared, you can\u2019t stop worrying about how it\u2019s gonna go. Eventually, you get to point where you realize, \u201cI have no choice here, so I\u2019ve gotta make the best of this.\u201d Hopefully.\n\nIt all happened pretty fast for you too, right?\n\nYeah, December 2 was the diagnosis and by December 8, I went in for surgery and they took the tonsil out \u2014 less than a week after the diagnosis. Like I said, I was lucky. After the initial bad news, everything I\u2019ve heard since then has been positive. It\u2019s only in one tonsil. It\u2019s not in your throat. Your chemotherapy isn\u2019t as heavy as it normally is, so it won\u2019t effect you so much. You\u2019re not going to lose your hair. You don\u2019t need as much radiation treatment, so you\u2019ll only be on the bench for about five minutes. The Rocky Mountain Cancer Center where I went, the one out in Aurora, is apparently where they send lots of prisoners. Like if they\u2019re in jail and they have cancer they have to go there. So I\u2019d show up, and the first time I\u2019d realized that there was an armed guard outside the radiation room, and then another guard showed up to escort a guy who was in a robe with a walker, and he\u2019d been in there getting radiation for like twenty minutes, so it had to have been something really invasive. I kept thinking, you know, this guy is not a flight risk, I don\u2019t know why they need two guards. This guy\u2019s not going anywhere. Another time, there was a lady in an orange jumpsuit getting chemotherapy, sitting there still shackled and a guard standing behind her. I\u2019m trying to figure out how to make a joke out of it.\n\nNothing like freedom to keep you grateful.\n\nThey tell you that attitude is everything. One of the radiologists told me that they had two people come in the same week with the same diagnosis, pretty much the same age, profile and treatment. But one of them had a good attitude and one of them had a terrible attitude. The person with a good attitude went through with almost no side effects and the person with the bad attitude just broke down time after time. Hope is such an important part of this. A positive outlook can mean so much, so if we can help somebody find that, then I feel like we\u2019re doing a good deed.\n\nYou were back at work pretty soon.\n\nI only missed one Tuesday, and that was the week after my surgery. The hard part being back was every week when the schedule would come out for the opening comics and not having my name on there. I had old friends coming into town and I knew I couldn\u2019t even go see them, much less perform with people I\u2019d normally be working with. That was really rough. I\u2019m still not really signing up yet, it\u2019ll probably be another week or two. I want to get where I\u2019m eating. As soon as I get the tube out of my belly, then I think I\u2019ll really start going back at it again. The other hard part is that standup comedy is kind of like a muscle, and if you don\u2019t exercise it, it\u2019ll atrophy.\n\nYou\u2019re worried about getting your sea legs back.\n\nI\u2019m worried about stage chops and missing my timing and stuff like that. I know it\u2019ll come back, but right now it\u2019s just rough. So is trying to write jokes that aren\u2019t about cancer.\n\nIt\u2019s got to make a lot of other premises seem pretty frivolous.\n\nHere\u2019s a weird thing. I probably have about twenty minutes of pot material, but I\u2019m officially an ex pot-smoker now. It seems like smoking anything right now is tempting fate. It seems hypocritical because smoking pot isn\u2019t what gave me cancer.\n\nBut you don\u2019t want to aggravate anything.\n\nNow I get mad when I see comics smoking cigarettes. Not pot, but if I see them smoking cigarettes, I just want to go up and slap it out of their mouth. If I had been a smoker or if I had been a drinker, my prognosis would not have been as good. They gave me an 85 percent success rate, but if I\u2019d been a smoker or drinker, it would have been at around 50 percent, so why even tempt that? Nothing against marijuana, I\u2019ll probably still do some edibles. In fact, early on in the treatment, I was doing tincture \u2014 the Dixie Elixir Dew Drops. Just three drops were enough to calm my stomach down so I could eat. Those drops were fantastic in the early stages before I had the feeding tube. Even the Doc said, \u201cAnything that helps your appetite or calms your stomach is fine.\u201d But I doubt I\u2019ll ever go back to smoking the way I was.\n\nWas it helpful to continue running New Talent Night every Tuesday?\n\nI didn\u2019t miss any Tuesdays, which was huge for me. It made me feel connected still. I was mostly just staying home a lot, so if I hadn\u2019t had Tuesdays I wouldn\u2019t have had anything to look forward to.\n\nIs there anything else you want to make sure to mention before we wrap up?\n\nOne thing I want to make sure we include are the two best things to come out of this experience for me, personally. How everybody rallied around me was just, wow. I\u2019ve never felt so loved in my entire life. I want to thank everybody who gave me a ride to the clinic because I would have had to take the bus out to Aurora for every treatment, but people lined up to give me rides. Terri Barton-Gregg housed me for a couple weeks after my surgery, she put me up in her house and took care of me. Nora Lynch set up the give forward account which provided funds early on. Wende Curtis has been great, and they\u2019ve been raising funds at the club for me; that took away all my concerns. For a while, I was afraid I would lose my apartment, but because of the fundraising all I\u2019ve had to worry about is getting better. So that was amazing. My comedy family did more for me than my actual family.\n\nThe second part is kind of tied to that, but I feel like it kind of validated my job. I\u2019ve been New Talent Coordinator for ten and a half years, and I often asked myself, \u201cWhat am I doing? Am I just running a glorified open mic? Am I helping anybody?\u201d So to have so many people come out and tell me that they feel like I helped them is really validating in a lot of ways. I am doing something. I think a lot of teachers maybe go through this, too, where they don\u2019t find out until down the road that they were successful. So those have been the two best things, feeling like I really have helped people, and then feeling all their love coming back to me. That\u2019s a big reason why I want to give back to the people who\u2019ve helped me.\n\nThe show begins at 7 p.m. on Sunday, March 1, at Comedy Works downtown.
