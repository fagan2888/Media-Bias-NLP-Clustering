He hails abortion as a \u201cconstitutional right\u201d and put pro-abortion radicals Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan on the Supreme Court to protect it. He opposes banning abortion even in the third trimester. He condemns legislation requiring basic medical care for infants born after failed abortions. He blasts personhood as \u201cabsurd.\u201d\n\nHe forced Americans to subsidize abortion via Obamacare\u2014including nuns. He supports the right to abort a child based on the child\u2019s sex, promoting abortion overseas, funding of medical research that kills human embryos, and forcing healthcare providers to participate in abortion. He expanded contraception funding.\n\nHis administration is unwilling to investigate Planned Parenthood despite video evidence of PP officials breaking multiple federal laws, and won\u2019t even commit to enforcing legal protection for wanted babies harmed in crimes against their pregnant mothers. And he infamously voted multiple times to let Illinois hospitals starve newborns to death.\n\nAnd yet, pro-abortion activists Erin Matson and Pamela Merritt write at Salon that Obama needs to \u201crepair\u201d his \u201ccompromised legacy on abortion rights.\u201d Yes, really\u2026\n\n[B]y not advocating for the advancement of abortion rights [in his 2015 Women\u2019s History Month speech], the president did a disservice to the millions of women for whom agency over their bodies is central not just to their economic freedom, but to their basic dignity as human beings. Perhaps his silence is due, in part, to his inexplicable failure to stand up for abortion rights for rape victims in war zones \u2013 a move fully within his executive power, and one that will stain his legacy toward women and girls if he doesn\u2019t rectify it soon. The absence of conversation and celebration of the full spectrum of reproductive rights is especially frustrating considering that politicians have shown that they will stop at nothing to infringe on basic dignity and human rights by passing laws restricting abortion access, chipping away at women\u2019s opportunities for full participation in society.\n\nAfter a couple paragraphs regurgitating the usual anti-Texas hysteria, the authors get back to their main point, that Obama needs to make up for\u2014make sure you\u2019re not drinking anything while you read this next line\u2014\u201ceight years of inaction on reproductive rights.\u201d\n\nRe-read the first three paragraphs. Does that look like eight years of inaction to you? Incredibly, these ladies think it\u2019s not enough because Obama has too often \u201clet women down by conceding\u201d to Congress:\n\nHe has been willing to uphold the Hyde Amendment and his egregious inaction on the Helms Amendment, which bars federal funding for abortion assistance overseas and which needs not exclude cases of rape, incest, and life endangerment, means he has work to do now.\n\nIn other words, Obama hasn\u2019t been unwilling to act enough like a dictator for these ladies\u2019 tastes when Congress won\u2019t give him what he wants. It\u2019s bad enough that he and his pro-abortion followers don\u2019t respect the Constitution; Matson and Merritt seem unaware we have a Constitution.\n\nSpeaking of which, their other complaint is that Obama\u2019s latest Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland, \u201chas no public legal or personal record on reproductive rights\u201d:\n\nLet us be clear: Yes, the Republican leadership has declared its intention to obstruct a vote on Garland\u2019s nomination, insisting that the Supreme Court should remain one short until a new president is elected, in the hopes that one of their antiabortion candidates can nominate their own champion against progress. But that was no reason for the president to fail women once more by trying to compromise with what has become an uncompromising force. Silence on abortion rights is not a net positive in a candidate; women deserve to know how a potential Supreme Court justice might vote on issues paramount to their health and well-being. They deserve leaders who are proud \u2013 not hesitant \u2013 to be their defenders.\n\nIn theory and up to a point, I agree\u2014the modern tradition of \u201cstealth nominees\u201d who have to tiptoe around their positions with code like \u201cprecedent\u201d and \u201clegislate from the bench\u201d is a farce that throws the objective of evaluating judges\u2019 constitutional fidelity to the wayside. For better or for worse, of course we deserve to know exactly what their legal philosophy is and how they apply it to past rulings like Roe v. Wade.\n\nIn practice, though, the authors\u2019 posturing is preposterous. However much they\u2019d salivate over nominees singing Roe\u2019s praises at their confirmation hearings, of course they know that stealth nominees have almost uniformly benefitted them\u2014just as Garland likely would, considering his praise of Harry Blackmun, ties to William Brennan, mostly pro-abortion law clerks, and vote for the Obama contraception mandate.\n\nSo don\u2019t let anyone tell you Barack Obama was a moderate or reasonable President. In the final analysis, he has slavishly protected nearly everything pro-aborts already have and given them virtually everything they demanded, within his ability to do so, only occasionally conceding to the most unavoidable confines of political circumstance. But those rare instances of him not being omnipotent are enough to give Erin Matson and Pamela Merritt the vapors.\n\nThere\u2019s just no pleasing some people.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Salon's complaints would cause one to think Obama hasn't forced nuns to pay for abortion, appointed pro-abortion justices, or funded the abortion industry.", "og": {"site_name": "Live Action News", "description": "Salon's complaints would cause one to think Obama hasn't forced nuns to pay for abortion, appointed pro-abortion justices, or funded the abortion industry.", "title": "Salon: Obama's presidency wasn't pro-abortion enough", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 672, "identifier": "http://liveactionnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Obama-Planned-Parenthood-20131.jpg", "height": 372}, "updated_time": "2016-03-21T22:08:32-04:00", "url": "http://liveactionnews.org/salon-obamas-presidency-wasnt-pro-abortion-enough/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Salon's complaints would cause one to think Obama hasn't forced nuns to pay for abortion, appointed pro-abortion justices, or funded the abortion industry.", "creator": "@liveactionnews", "image": "http://liveactionnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Obama-Planned-Parenthood-20131.jpg", "title": "Salon: Obama's presidency wasn't pro-abortion enough", "site": "@liveactionnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "framework": "Alkivia Framework 0.8", "fb": {"admins": 159900244, "pages": 49651563727}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/liveactionnewsonline", "section": "Analysis", "tag": "taxpayer funding for abortion", "published_time": "2016-03-22T08:55:36-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-21T22:08:32-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "He hails abortion as a \u201cconstitutional right\u201d and put pro-abortion radicals Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan on the Supreme Court to protect it.\nPresident Barack Obama has made clear he would rather shut down the federal government than defund Planned Parenthood.\nIt\u2019s bad enough that he and his pro-abortion followers don\u2019t respect the Constitution; Matson and Merritt seem unaware we have a Constitution.\nBut those rare instances of him not being omnipotent are enough to give Erin Matson and Pamela Merritt the vapors.\nSilence on abortion rights is not a net positive in a candidate; women deserve to know how a potential Supreme Court justice might vote on issues paramount to their health and well-being."}
