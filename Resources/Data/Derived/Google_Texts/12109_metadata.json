The speeches in \u201cSelma\u201d aren\u2019t Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s real words.\n\nRELATED LINKS\n\n2. It\u2019s not just hobbits wearing prosthetic ears.\n\n\u201cSelma\u201d director Ava DuVernay didn\u2019t get the rights to the famed civil rights leader\u2019s speeches so she rewrote them herself\n\nIn \u201cThe Theory of Everything,\u201d makeup artists had to add subtle details to Eddie Redmayne\u2019s character physicist Stephen Hawking to make his aging look more realistic. As the character of Hawking grew older, Redmayne wore prosthetic earlobes.\n\n3. Childhood angst almost killed a character in \u201cBoyhood.\u201d\n\nLorelai Linklater, the daughter of \u201cBoyhood\u201d director Richard Linklater, acted in the movie as Samantha, the older sister of lead character Mason Evans Jr. At one point, Lorelai asked her father to kill her character off because she didn\u2019t want to be in it anymore.\n\n4. The \u201cAmerican Sniper\u201d baby was fake.\n\nClint Eastwood\u2019s \u201cAmerican Sniper\u201d was No. 1 at the box office in mid-January, but it didn\u2019t get there without a fair bit of criticism. Its portrayal of the military aside, critics and viewers are crying out against main character Chris Kyle\u2019s baby. It was fake. In a one-minute, 13-second scene, actor Bradley Cooper held the doll close before placing it in a crib. The prop\u2019s stiffness made it into several reviews.\n\n5. Miles Teller in \u201cWhiplash\u201d was practicing all wrong.\n\nAccording to Mark Sherman, an international performer and jazz faculty at the Juilliard School, Miles Teller\u2019s drumming technique was a little off. \u201cHe\u2019s practicing, really trying to get faster and faster, and he\u2019s drawing blood. That\u2019s unrealistic,\u201d Sherman told Vulture. \u201cPeople don\u2019t draw blood like that, playing music. It just doesn\u2019t happen, and if you do, you\u2019re holding the sticks wrong. You\u2019re screwed up technically if you\u2019re drawing blood.\u201d\n\n6. \u201cThe Grand Budapest Hotel\u201d does not take place in Budapest, Hungary, but rather, the fictional European country Zubrowka.\n\nAlthough it is never featured in the film, Zubrowka even has its own national anthem with the following stanzas:\n\nThe spirit of Zubrowka will not be abated\n\nYour glory and grandeur will be forever stated!\n\nThe anthem was featured in a fictional history video of Zubrowka produced to accompany a new collection of writing by Austrian writer Stefan Zweig, who inspired the film.\n\n7. Scenes in \u201cBoyhood\u201d were based off real-life events from the actors\u2019 lives.\n\nIn \u201cBoyhood,\u201d protagonist Mason Jr., receives a Beatles mix CD as a 15th birthday gift from his on-screen father played by Ethan Hawke. In real life, Hawke gave his oldest daughter Maya the same gift. The liner notes Hawke wrote Maya were reworked for use in the film.\n\n8. In order to make \u201cBirdman\u201d appear as though it was shot in one long, continuous take, the crew was forced to be creative.\n\nArmed with a budget drastically smaller than the superhero films it satirizes, the \u201cBirdman\u201d crew made sure to keep costs down. One scene called for Michael Keaton\u2019s washed-up actor to scurry across New York\u2019s Time Square half-naked in underwear and socks. This needed to be done in one take. So, to avoid onlookers derailing the scene and without the money to just hire dozens of extras, a marching band was assembled to distract people from spying the nearly naked Keaton rushing by.\n\nPBS NewsHour reporter Joshua Barajas contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Which film featured a fake baby?
