Vision for game day may be a reality

By Jay Miller

“Early in the week I thought it was touch-and-go, but as the week progressed I’ve felt better and better, more confident that it’s going to happen,” said Spencer Barnett.

Barnett’s photo depicting an orange-and-white checkered Neyland Stadium was responsible for sparking the sensation in Vol Nation.

“Just with the amount of Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter activity there has been, and the media attention, the fans just seem excited about it,” Barnett said.

Barnett is attending Saturday’s game against Florida, however, he still is not sure what color shirt he will wear.

“I still don’t know what section I am sitting in, I’m waiting to hear, so I am packing both colors,” he said.

That said, no one will know until kick-off tomorrow, which adds to the excitement to the game. Still, some fans think weather may be a factor.

“It depends how cold it gets,” said Vols fan Clay Prewitt. “Most people have orange-and-white T-shirts, but jackets? That might change things.”

While Barnett recognizes his role in the movement, he says he knows who really made Checker Neyland happen.

“If there is anything I could say to the fans it’s ‘thank you for making my little image into what it has become,’” he said. “If it wasn’t for them, it wouldn’t happen.”

Kick-off is at noon Saturday, and football fans around the country will be watching to see if UT fans can successfully “Checker Neyland.”

“The big question is the band,” Prewitt added. “What are they going to wear?”?

Tim McLeod, one of the web developers responsible for creating checkerneyland.com, expressed his confidence earlier in the week.

McLeod had a reason to be confident. As of Tuesday afternoon checkerneyland.com had already accumulated over 200,000 visits to the site.
