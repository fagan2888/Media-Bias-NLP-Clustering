The Christian pastor, who was in Iran to help build an orphanage, was later sentenced to eight years in prison on religion-related charges.\n\n\u201cIt was just very cold,\u201d Abedini said about her initial call to the State Department. \u201c[One official] said \u2018We\u2019re not Hollywood\u2014we can\u2019t just fly in there and save people.\u2019\u201d\n\nShe said Clinton and State Department officials brushed off phone calls and letters from her attorneys and members of Congress for months.\n\n\u201cWe received nothing, no movement, no comments, nothing until March [2013], and Kerry was the first to say something,\u201d Abedini said.\n\n\u201cFrom the first phone call I expected movement,\u201d she added. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect nothing. Somewhere along the line I felt like the message I was getting from them was, \u2018We don\u2019t want to ruffle feathers [with Iran], we want to focus on the nuclear [issue].\u2019\u201d\n\nA senior State Department official defended Clinton\u2019s record, saying agency officials spoke out in support of Saeed Abedini as soon as his wife asked them to do so.\n\n\u201cOnce the family asked the U.S. government to speak publicly on the case, we publicly noted our concern about Mr. Abedini\u2019s welfare, called on Iran to respect its own laws and provide him access to an attorney, requested consular access on behalf of Swiss officials, and called for his immediate release,\u201d the official said.\n\n\u201cThe Swiss government, in its role as our protecting power, has continued to raise these cases with Iran on our behalf, as have other countries whom we have asked to press Iran to cooperate on these cases.\u201d\n\nThe State Department issued its first public statement on Abedini\u2019s imprisonment on Jan. 27, 2013, six months after he was first detained. Clinton officially stepped down as secretary of state on Feb. 1, 2013.\n\nState Department spokeswoman Marie Harf noted the agency\u2019s actions on Iranian human rights issues under Clinton, including its lobbying for UN General Assembly resolutions condemning Iran\u2019s human rights abuses.\n\nShe added that 19 individuals and 15 entities in Iran were sanctioned by Clinton\u2019s State Department for their role in human rights violations.\n\n\u201cFrom North Korea to Syria, and across the globe, Secretary Clinton spoke up and stood up for the universal rights the United States stands up for everywhere: the freedom for people to have a say in their future, to make their voices heard, and to live their lives free from fear,\u201d Harf said.\n\nNorth Korean and Syrian activists in Geneva were less taken with Clinton\u2019s performance.\n\nAhn Myong-Chol, a North Korean (DPRK) dissident whose descriptions of the country\u2019s prison camps played a major role in this month\u2019s harrowing UN report on the regime\u2019s human rights abuses, said he \u201creally preferred John Kerry compared to Hillary Clinton\u201d at the State Department.\n\nWhile Ahn said he believed Clinton would get \u201ca lot of people\u2019s votes [if she runs for president in 2016] because she could be the very first female president of the United States,\u201d he added that he disliked \u201cHillary Clinton\u2019s passive actions when it comes to the DPRK.\u201d\n\nClinton\u2019s early efforts at outreach with North Korea were rebuffed by the authoritarian regime and the State Department made no progress on dismantling the DPRK\u2019s nuclear weapons program under Clinton\u2019s leadership.\n\nMoayad Iskafe, a Syrian journalist and opposition activist who helped smuggle reporters into the country after civil war broke out in 2011, said he was initially optimistic about Clinton\u2019s position on Syria.\n\n\u201cShe said Bashar Assad [should] go,\u201d Iskafe said. \u201cBut after that I did not hear [her] voice. After that, she said we can\u2019t do anything for Syria \u2026 she said we will not take our army to Syria \u2026 we will do nothing.\u201d\n\nAhn and Iskafe acknowledged that their concerns about Clinton were related to a larger criticism of the Obama administration\u2019s policies she was carrying out.\n\n\u201cFor the Bush administration, they used to send strong messages with strong gestures,\u201d Ahn said through a translator. \u201cThe Obama administration only puts verbal pressure.\u201d\n\nThe North Korean dissident, a former prison camp guard, criticized the administration for its response to North Korea\u2019s imprisonment of American missionary Kenneth Bae.\n\n\u201cThe way the U.S. reacts to this incident looks very passive,\u201d Ahn said.\n\nHarf said Clinton\u2019s State Department sponsored and lobbied for resolutions condemning North Korea\u2019s human rights abuses at the United Nations, and said Clinton played a major role in deploying Bill Clinton to North Korea to obtain the release of imprisoned U.S. journalists in 2009.\n\nWhile Iskafe said he was disappointed the Obama administration has not done more to help the Syrian opposition, he said he had little faith that any other U.S. president would have acted differently under the current circumstances.\n\n\u201cIf George Bush [were] the president now, maybe he\u2019d do nothing,\u201d Iskafe said. \u201cThere is government\u2014they know what they do, they know what they want to do. It\u2019s not personal.\u201d\n\n\u201cSyrian people are not [Obama\u2019s] people,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd this is our luck, it is our luck to be Syrian.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Activists highlight record of inaction during Clinton\u2019s tenure of secretary of state", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s record on human rights came under harsh criticism in Geneva, Switzerland, last week as political dissidents and pro-democracy activists gathered at a conf", "title": "Human Rights Advocates Blast Hillary Clinton", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/politics/human-rights-advocates-blast-hillary-clinton/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/HillaryClinton-150x150.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s record on human rights came under harsh criticism in G", "creator": "@alanagoodman", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/HillaryClinton-150x150.jpg", "title": "Human Rights Advocates Blast Hillary Clinton", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbdde\"", "article_summary": "State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf noted the agency\u2019s actions on Iranian human rights issues under Clinton, including its lobbying for UN General Assembly resolutions condemning Iran\u2019s human rights abuses.\nBY: Follow @alanagoodmanFormer Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s record on human rights came under harsh criticism in Geneva, Switzerland, last week as political dissidents and pro-democracy activists gathered at a conference ahead of the United Nations Human Rights Council\u2019s annual session.\nShe added that 19 individuals and 15 entities in Iran were sanctioned by Clinton\u2019s State Department for their role in human rights violations.\nShe said she first contacted the State Department in August 2012, days after her husband Saeed Abedini was detained in Tehran.\n\u201cFor Hillary Clinton to have been completely silent, and not have done anything when my husband was taken, and knowing \u2026 it was strictly on a human rights issue, really bothered me because I expected otherwise from my government,\u201d Abedini said."}
