If we seek to protect and preserve freedom, to whom should we entrust the positions of chief executive and commander-in-chief?\n\nDonald Trump spent much of his life as a Democrat, handing millions of dollars to the very candidates who not only grew government but supported the policies Trump now rails against. He has chalked these campaign contributions up to being a \u201ccost of business\u201d -- that is, he claims you simply must pay off politicians to get things done. If there was no ideological basis for his contributions, the best one can say is that Trump chose to sell out the country to progressive Democrats for his own personal gain. For decades.\n\nAre we to believe that he now sincerely wishes to absolve himself of these sins?\n\nTrump\u2019s positions themselves are transparently not conservative. They are based more in temperament -- toughness, strength, extracting a pound of flesh -- than they are in the ideology represented by the Declaration of Independence and Constitution.\n\nTrump wants to build a wall and deport 11 million illegal immigrants -- but then he wants to provide amnesty to the vast majority of them, \u201cthe good ones,\u201d quickly thereafter.\n\nHe supports protectionist trade policies -- levying tariffs that represent a massive tax on all manner of goods purchased by Americans. He is for leaving entitlements, the massive welfare state under which the federal budget will ultimately collapse, alone.\n\nHe is for socialized medicine, just not Obamacare.\n\nTrump is for pushing people out of their homes if a developer can use the land to generate more tax revenue through the liberal use of eminent domain.\n\nHe wants America to extricate itself from the world -- but he also wants to destroy ISIS. He will be \u201cneutral\u201d between the Israelis and the Arabs.\n\nHe believes that if abortion were outlawed, women would need to be punished for having them -- precisely the position Leftists incorrectly think a conservative would take. Trump then flopped on the issue. He also supports Planned Parenthood.\n\nThese views are \u201cheterodox,\u201d if utterly inconsistent on their face, because they are not based on the set of coherent unifying principles called conservatism.", "article_metadata": {"page-title": "Cruz's Principles Are Coherent Because Cruz Understands America", "pinterest": "nopin", "og": {"site_name": "PJ Media", "description": "Trump is incoherent because he simply does not understand the American idea.", "title": "Republicans Should Stand for Ted Cruz's Principles", "url": "https://pjmedia.com/blog/ted-cruzs-principles-are-americas-principles/", "image": "https://pajamasmed.hs.llnwd.net/e1/user-content/1/files/2016/05/128939125.sized-770x415xt.jpg", "updated_time": 1464358859, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Trump is incoherent because he simply does not understand the American idea.", "title": "Republicans Should Stand for Ted Cruz's Principles", "url": "https://pjmedia.com/blog/ted-cruzs-principles-are-americas-principles/", "image": "https://pajamasmed.hs.llnwd.net/e1/user-content/1/files/2016/05/128939125.sized-770x415xt.jpg", "site": "@PJMedia_com", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Cruz's Principles Are Coherent Because Cruz Understands America", "pinterestDescription": "Republicans Should Stand for Ted Cruz's Principles", "fb": {"app_id": 149848758413844}, "keywords": "Ted Cruz, Donald Trump", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Ted Cruz's Principles Are America's PrinciplesDonald Trump purports to be an outsider who wants to give the \u201cforgotten man\u201d a seat at the table -- though he has been cutting deals at that table his entire life.\nDonald Trump spent much of his life as a Democrat, handing millions of dollars to the very candidates who not only grew government but supported the policies Trump now rails against.\nTrump wants to build a wall and deport 11 million illegal immigrants -- but then he wants to provide amnesty to the vast majority of them, \u201cthe good ones,\u201d quickly thereafter.\nTed Cruz wants to flip the table over, fire/primary everyone sitting at it, and sell it off to pay down the national debt.\nThese views are \u201cheterodox,\u201d if utterly inconsistent on their face, because they are not based on the set of coherent unifying principles called conservatism."}
