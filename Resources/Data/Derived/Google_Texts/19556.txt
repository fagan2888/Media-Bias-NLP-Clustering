NEW YORK (AP) — A sea of Palestinians and their sympathizers lined Manhattan streets Saturday, marching to the United Nations and shouting that Israel’s response to missile attacks was genocide that took children’s lives.

“What they’re doing is wrong,” said Ayia Mustafa, 12, of the New York borough of Bronx. “I’m here to protest what’s going on in Gaza. What’s going on is wrong — bad things like killing children.”

She was among about 500 demonstrators who walked to the United Nations on Manhattan’s East Side after gathering behind police barricades off Columbus Circle to protest Israeli actions in the Gaza Strip.

Hamas, which the United States and other countries consider a terrorist organization, governs much of Gaza.

In midtown Manhattan, police on motorcycles stood by, engines revved up to accompany the marchers before they peacefully headed toward the United Nations building.

“We are all Palestinians and because of the occupation there is no justice in Gaza,” said Zouleikha Ban, 57, a native of Algeria who lives in the borough of Staten Island.

Several days previously, hundreds of Palestinian supporters marched and demonstrated in front of a midtown Manhattan office building after a 72-hour humanitarian cease fire broke down in Gaza. They said then they would hold more rallies as the conflict continues.
