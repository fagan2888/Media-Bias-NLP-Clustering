Maybe!\n\nWhat a fascinating time. When you start staring at our government and its economy, you can start to feel an urge to put together a Carrie Mathison-style wall chart. Because on some level, it all starts to seem like it fits together, doesn\u2019t it?\n\n\u2022 Here is an \u201cexplainer\u201d about What The Federal Reserve Does. Spoiler: what the Fed has done for the last several years is literally give money for free to banks every day. Banks use that borrowed money to make money, including, even, sometimes, by loaning that money to customers. Exciting policy, am I right? \u201cThe campaign that gets all the publicity is called quantitative easing. The Fed has purchased more than $4 trillion in Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities since 2008,\u201d thereby pushing prices up, it helpfully explains. Then, quite a bit further down: \u201cThe Fed pays for its purchases by creating money from nothing.\u201d There we go. They print money then give it to banks for free. It\u2019s cool! I mean it\u2019s probably actually not capitalism in any sense of the word though?\n\n\u2022 Then there\u2019s a group of politicians who say the Treasury is lying when it says that it will run out of money on October 17 \u2014 that\u2019s a week from tomorrow \u2014 to pay debts. (Already the interest rate on that debt is increasing.) Such as Senator Richard Burr. How is Treasury wrong? Easy! We laid off all the government employees, so we have money on hand!\n\n\u201cWe always have enough money to pay our debt service,\u201d said Mr. Burr, who pointed to a stream of tax revenue flowing into the Treasury as he shrugged off fears of a cascading financial crisis. \u201cYou\u2019ve had the federal government out of work for close to two weeks; that\u2019s about $24 billion a month. Every month, you have enough saved in salaries alone that you\u2019re covering three-fifths, four-fifths of the total debt service, about $35 billion a month. That\u2019s manageable for some time.\u201d\n\nPerfect. Also, tax revenues are still coming in! Just don\u2019t try to call the IRS to ask any questions, because they\u2019re not answering. That is definitely capitalism: putting people out of work and enjoying the savings.\n\n\u2022 What\u2019s most annoying is that when you conceive of siding with Republicans, who ostensibly want to decrease spending and create a \u201csmaller\u201d government, and when you think \u201cyes, I too would like to limit the amount of debt that the government can agree to carry!\u201d they start screaming about \u201cObamacare\u201d \u2014 like Representative Paul Broun of Georgia: \u201cThe greatest threat right now is Obamacare. It\u2019s already destroyed jobs, it\u2019s already destroyed our economy, and if it stays in place as it is now, it\u2019s going to destroy America.\u201d And you realize they\u2019re just liars and crazies. (Oh right, and also the party that tried to bankrupt the country with a decade (I mean, at least) of war profiteering, but apparently we don\u2019t talk about that.)\n\n\u2022 How will business react to this instability? The same way they always have:\n\nFrom New York to Silicon Valley, more and more large American corporations are reducing their tax bill by buying a foreign company and effectively renouncing their United States citizenship.\n\nYay, let\u2019s end the U.S. government and move back to the old worlds from which the majority of us came.", "article_metadata": {"description": "What a fascinating time.
