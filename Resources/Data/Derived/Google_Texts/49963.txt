Dr. Richard Pitts, whose career as a physician, health educator and hospital administrator spans nearly 40 years, has been named medical director at Arrowhead Regional Medical Center in Colton.

âWe are thrilled and very fortunate to have Dr. Pitts join us as our new medical director,â said Arrowhead Regional Director Patrick Petre. âHis vast experience in all aspects of medicine and knowledge of very complex health care issues will be vital for ARMC as we begin to navigate health reform and other major shifts in our industry.â

Pitts starts his new job Monday, Sept. 9, replacing Dr. Dev GnanaDev, who served in that post from 2000 to 2012. Dr. Emily Ebert has been acting medical director since January.

Pitts will be responsible for a wide range of duties, including oversight of the delivery of medical services, monitoring daily patient care activities and providing a clinical perspective on all matters related to medical services to the administrative team.

Pitts also will assist the medical center in the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. The Individual Mandate portion of the law providing health coverage to millions of uninsured Americans takes effect Jan. 1.

Pitts, a native of Massachusetts, previously worked at Kaiser Permanente in Anaheim from 1999 to 2011 as assistant medical director for Kaiserâs Orange County service area. From 1998 to 2011, he also held the position of chief of occupational medicine and employee health, also for Kaiserâs Orange County service area.

Certified by the American Board of Emergency Medicine and American Board of Preventive Medicine, Pitts earned his doctor of osteopathic medicine degree from Des Moines University and a PhD from Walden University.
