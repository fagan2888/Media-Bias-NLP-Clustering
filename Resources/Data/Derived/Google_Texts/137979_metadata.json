Michael Bennet was one of the few Democrats to emerge from his party\u2019s drubbing on Tuesday with little more than a political paper cut.\n\nIt\u2019s an impressive feat, especially because Bennet has spent the past two years running the Democratic machine that tried \u2014 and failed \u2014 to land the one-two punch of re-electing Colorado Democrat Mark Udall and keeping his party in control of the Senate.\n\nBut in the immediate aftermath of Election Day, most of the friendly fire on the Democratic side was aimed at the Obama administration, with one top Senate aide telling The Washington Post that he didn\u2019t think \u201cthe political team at the White House truly was up to speed.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, several top Republicans, including Cory Gardner, said they were willing to look past Bennet\u2019s role as chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.\n\n\u201cLook, that was Michael Bennet\u2019s job,\u201d Gardner said fewer than 24 hours after ousting Udall. \u201cHe did what he believed he had to do to fulfill his duties. I look forward to working with him.\u201d\n\nHow did Bennet manage to keep relations friendly with Republicans while trying to keep the Senate in Democratic hands?\n\nPoliticos said it came down to three factors: Bennet\u2019s desire to keep his reputation as a moderate, his skill at fundraising and the inherent nature of politics on the national stage.\n\n\u201cBoth parties are going to have campaign committees, and someone has to run them,\u201d said Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., who joined Bennet last year in crafting an immigration bill.\n\n\u201c(But) when it comes down to governing, most senators are able to put away the campaign aspects (and focus on passing legislation),\u201d Rubio said.\n\nBennet\u2019s desire to preserve his middle-of-the-road persona, in fact, was one reason he initially balked at becoming DSCC chairman. After turning down the job in 2010, he thought about the offer for about a month before accepting the reins for the 2014 campaign.\n\n\u201cI \u2026 wanted to make sure it would not interfere with my ability to work in a bipartisan way in the Senate,\u201d Bennet said in 2012.\n\nYet taking a turn at the helm of the DSCC \u2014 or its counterpart, the National Republican Senatorial Committee \u2014 often is a prerequisite for politicians looking to rise in the ranks. Another benefit: DSCC and NRSC chairs get to know the big-money donors in their parties. And with Bennet up for re-election in 2016, this kind of network could prove invaluable.\n\n\u201cThe contacts you make in that position carry on for many, many years,\u201d said Rick Ridder, a veteran Democratic consultant.\n\nBennet\u2019s prowess at fundraising for the DSCC also could help insulate him from criticism in the aftermath of Tuesday\u2019s historic loss; never before has a DSCC chairman lost a race in his or her home state.\n\nHeaded into the homestretch, the DSCC had outraised its Republican counterpart $134 million to $108 million, according to The Associated Press.\n\nStill, Ridder said Bennet won\u2019t escape all the blame for Democratic losses nationwide. But he expected the pain would be minimal.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019ll take a few nicks, but when you get a (partisan) wave like that (on Tuesday night), political professionals ultimately say there\u2019s not a lot you can do to prevent (it),\u201d Ridder said.\n\nBut he said Bennet still could learn a lesson from Tuesday\u2019s results. For the past couple cycles, Democrats have put their faith in a ground-game operation that relied heavily on cutting-edge technology.\n\nThat\u2019s not enough, even for a politician such as Bennet, who helped pioneer the marriage of politics and Big Data, he said.\n\n\u201cIf there is a message to Democrats from 2014, it is that all the toys in the world do not make up for good messaging,\u201d Ridder said.\n\nAsked what went wrong Tuesday, Bennet ascribed the defeats to a \u201ctough environment,\u201d adding, \u201cI really think we did all we could do and our candidates did all they could.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "In spite of Election Day losses, Michael Bennet\u2019s career survives", "title": "In spite of Election Day losses, Michael Bennet\u2019s career survives", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/11/05/in-spite-of-election-day-losses-michael-bennets-career-survives/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131221__bennettp1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131221__bennettp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-05T18:43:03+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T23:58:56+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Election 2014"}, "article_summary": "Bennet\u2019s desire to preserve his middle-of-the-road persona, in fact, was one reason he initially balked at becoming DSCC chairman.\n\u201cI \u2026 wanted to make sure it would not interfere with my ability to work in a bipartisan way in the Senate,\u201d Bennet said in 2012.\nBennet\u2019s prowess at fundraising for the DSCC also could help insulate him from criticism in the aftermath of Tuesday\u2019s historic loss; never before has a DSCC chairman lost a race in his or her home state.\n\u201cLook, that was Michael Bennet\u2019s job,\u201d Gardner said fewer than 24 hours after ousting Udall.\n\u201cThe contacts you make in that position carry on for many, many years,\u201d said Rick Ridder, a veteran Democratic consultant."}
