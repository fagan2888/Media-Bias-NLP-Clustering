INDIANAPOLIS — Bengals linebacker Rey Maualuga hurt a hamstring early in the second quarter of a playoff game against the Colts on Sunday and will not return.

Maualuga left the field on a cart for an evaluation. His injury left the Bengals without their top two linebackers — Vontaze Burfict missed most of the season with injuries. Maualuga missed four games early in the season with an injured left hamstring, and the defense stabilized once he returned.

A trainer looked at Maualuga’s right leg on the sideline before a cart was brought to the bench to take him to the locker room.
