A northeast Kansas man has been charged with killing a 7-month-old baby.

Twenty-four-year-old Aaron Peck, of Overland Park, was arrested and charged Friday with first-degree murder and child abuse. He is jailed in Johnson County, with bond set at $1 million. No attorney is listed for him in online court records.

The baby was hurt in Shawnee and died Tuesday. It wasn't immediately known how Peck knew the child. He is scheduled to appear in court Monday.
