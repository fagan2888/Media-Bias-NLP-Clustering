Prosecutors can use at trial most of what the Aurora movie theater gunman told two investigators about bombs in his apartment, even though the gunman was questioned after requesting a lawyer, according to a judge’s order.

In a 126-page order issued Thursday, Arapahoe County District Court Judge Carlos Samour ruled that police were justified in asking James Holmes about the explosives because the urgency of the situation required them to elicit information from Holmes in order to defuse the bombs safely.

“Given the precarious situation that confronted the officers, the need for answers to their questions outweighed the need to honor the defendant’s invocation of the … right to counsel,” Samour wrote in his order.

Holmes is charged with murdering 12 people and trying to kill dozens more inside the Century Aurora 16 movie theater on July 20, 2012, as well as with rigging his apartment with explosives. He first asked for a lawyer only minutes into questioning after his arrest.

Despite the request, police kept a public defender from meeting with Holmes on July 20. They also returned to interview Holmes on the afternoon of July 20 about the bombs, even though a lawyer the Holmes’ family hired told a police detective that law enforcement was not permitted to speak with him. An attorney should have been present when Holmes was questioned, his defense argued.

But Samour ruled Thursday that allowing an attorney to be present could have endangered lives.

“Officers could ill-afford to attempt to broker a compromise with an attorney acting on the defendant’s behalf,” Samour wrote.

Without information from Holmes, police concluded that the best option was to set off the bombs inside his apartment and allow them to burn the entire building down.

Holmes’ statements about the bombs to an Aurora detective and an FBI agent were made voluntarily and without coercion, Samour ruled.
