NEWARK — An inmate was found dead in his cell at the Essex County Correctional Facility early today and authorities are investigating the man’s death as suspicious.

Desmond Sanders, 27, of Newark, was found unresponsive at about 5:30 a.m. in his cell, which he shared with another inmate, according to Anthony Ambrose, chief of detectives at the Essex County Prosecutor's Office. Authorities said they believe Sanders death may be related to an altercation he had with his cell mate overnight, but stopped short of calling it a homicide investigation.

Ambrose said the investigation was ongoing pending the results of an autopsy.
