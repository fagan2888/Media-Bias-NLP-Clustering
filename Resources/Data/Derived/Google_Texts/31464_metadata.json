He accused the party of using the issue for political gains today.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t have the strength to go after it back then. But now are trying to make a political issue if it now,\u201d Mr. Marino said, Fox News reported Saturday.\n\nSEE ALSO: House backs faster deportations, cancels \u2018dreamer\u2019 policy\n\nMs. Pelosi crossed the chamber to directly confront the congressman in front of the other representatives and House cameras.\n\nAlthough Ms. Pelosi could not be heard in the video footage, Mr. Marino responded, accusing Ms. Pelosi of failing to do her research.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s true, madam leader, I did the research on it. You might want to try it. You might want to try it, madam leader. Do the research on it. Do the research. I did it. That\u2019s on thing that you don\u2019t do, \u201d he said.\n\nIllinois Republican Rep. Randy Hultgren, the presiding officer, told Mr. Marino to direct his comments through the chair and not at a fellow member.\n\n\u201cWell, it works both ways,\u201d Mr. Marino shot back, Fox News reported.\n\nAs Ms. Pelosi returned to the Democratic side of the chamber, Mr. Marino added, \u201cApparently I hit the right nerve.\u201d\n\nMs. Pelosi immediately turned and marched across the chamber again to confront Mr. Marino.\n\nOther representatives were stunned by the confrontation. Fox News reported that Rep. Nita Lowey (D-N.Y.), could be heard off-camera saying, \u201cWhat is she doing?\u201d\n\nA spokeswoman for Ms. Pelosi later told The Hill that Ms. Pelosi \u201cjust wanted to remind the Congressman that house Democrats had the courage to pass the DREAM Act \u2013 and have the courage to stand up for what the American people want, bipartisan, comprehensive immigration reform.\u201d\n\nMr. Marino told reporters that his remarks were not a personal attack on Ms. Pelosi. He added that reports that Ms. Pelosi\u2019s spokesman that he had apologized for the incident were false.\n\n\u201cRep. Pelosi called me an \u2018insignificant person\u2019 on the Floor of the House. I\u2019ll ponder that for a while driving to Williamsport tonight. Of course I\u2019ll be driving myself, with no staff or security. And I\u2019m just a country lawyer who worked in a bakery until he was 30,\u201d he said over several tweets later.\n\nThe House passed the new border security bill by a vote of 223-189.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Tensions rose during heated debates over the latest House Border security bill when Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi crossed the aisle to confront Pennsylvania Republican Tom Marino.", "Author": "Kellan Howell", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Tensions rose during heated debates over the latest House Border security bill when Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi crossed the aisle to confront Pennsylvania Republican Tom Marino.", "title": "Pelosi charges GOP congressman during House immigration debate: \u2018I hit the right nerve\u2019", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/aug/2/pelosi-charges-gop-congressman-during-house-immigr/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/07/31/house-obama-lawsuitjpeg-08c22.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/07/31/house-obama-lawsuitjpeg-08c22.jpg", "title": "Pelosi charges GOP congressman during House immigration debate: \u2018", "description": "Tensions rose during heated debates over the latest House Border security bill when Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi crossed the aisle to confront Pennsylvania Republican Tom Marino.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Politics, Tom Marino, Nancy Pelosi"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcba11\"", "article_summary": "Although Ms. Pelosi could not be heard in the video footage, Mr. Marino responded, accusing Ms. Pelosi of failing to do her research.\nAs Ms. Pelosi returned to the Democratic side of the chamber, Mr. Marino added, \u201cApparently I hit the right nerve.\u201dMs. Pelosi immediately turned and marched across the chamber again to confront Mr. Marino.\nIllinois Republican Rep.
