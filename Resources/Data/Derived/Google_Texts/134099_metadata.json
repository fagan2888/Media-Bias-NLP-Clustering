A fair portion of Colbert\u2019s roast addressed his Catholicism, he even introduced himself as \u201cAmerica\u2019s most favorite Catholic.\u201d\n\nThough with Cardinal Timothy Dolan a few feet away, he added, \u201cI\u2019m sure the Cardinal is thinking, \u2018Stephen, pride is a sin.\u2019 Well Cardinal, so is envy, so we\u2019re even.\u201d\n\nHe noted how the Al Smith Dinner is one of the biggest \u201crituals\u201d of American politics, aside from \u201cthe Republicans sacrificing 2014 to Ted Cruz\u2018s ego.\u201d Colbert thanked Dolan and said he has great respect for him, though it\u2019s hard for him when he\u2019s wearing an outfit that makes him look like \u201ca matador who\u2019s really let himself go.\u201d\n\n-RELATED: This Week in Buffoonery: Oprah, Bunny Sex, Anti-Tea Party Metaphors, and More!\n\nColbert also joked about the rather humble leader of the Catholic Church, Pope Francis.\n\n\u201cI believe the Pope is infallible, but he\u2019s also wrong about a lot of things\u2026 If Pope Francis were throwing tonight\u2019s party, we wouldn\u2019t be at white tie and the Waldorf, we\u2019d be in sweatpants crammed in the corner booth of the IHOP splitting a Rooty Tooty Fresh \u2018N Fruity.\u201d\n\nColbert also poked fun at Chris Matthews, telling the MSNBC host that \u201chaving \u2018Hardball\u2019 is now covered by Obamacare,\u201d and failed New York mayoral candidate Christine Quinn, saying \u201cNew York City is the only place in the world where the lesbian candidate is too conservative.\u201d\n\nAnd, of course, Colbert couldn\u2019t resist getting in some cracks at Michael Bloomberg. He explained the only reason New York\u2019s outgoing mayor is trying to ban large sodas is because \u201che\u2019s afraid he might drown in one.\u201d\n\nFull video of Colbert\u2019s roast is not available yet, but you can listen to the audio here, via Whispers in the Loggia:\n\nPlease enable Javascript to watch.\n\n[photo via screengrab]\n\n\u2014 \u2014\n\nFollow Josh Feldman on Twitter: @feldmaniac", "article_metadata": {"description": "Late night host Stephen Colbert spoke at the Al Smith Dinner in New York last night, and summarily roasted everyone from Mayor Michael Bloomberg to Henry", "generator": "WordPress 2016.21", "og": {"image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Screen-Shot-2013-10-18-at-1.27.03-PM.png", "title": "LISTEN: Colbert\u2019s Hilarious Roast of Bloomberg, Matthews, and the Pope at Al Smith Dinner"}, "twitter": {"description": "Late night host Stephen Colbert spoke at the Al Smith Dinner in New York last night, and summarily roasted everyone from Mayor Michael Bloomberg to Henry Kissinger to, yes, even Pope Francis himself.", "title": "LISTEN: Colbert's Hilarious Roast of Bloomberg, Matthews, and the Pope at Al Smith Dinner", "image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Screen-Shot-2013-10-18-at-1.27.03-PM.png", "creator": "@feldmaniac", "site": "@mediaite", "card": "summary"}, "NextGEN": "1.5.5", "date": "2013-10-18T13:52:07+00:00", "keywords": "online", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.5, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Late night host Stephen Colbert spoke at the Al Smith Dinner in New York last night, and summarily roasted everyone from Mayor Michael Bloomberg to Henry Kissinger to, yes, even Pope Francis himself.\nColbert also joked about the rather humble leader of the Catholic Church, Pope Francis.\n[photo via screengrab]\u2014 \u2014Follow Josh Feldman on Twitter: @feldmaniac\nHe explained the only reason New York\u2019s outgoing mayor is trying to ban large sodas is because \u201che\u2019s afraid he might drown in one.\u201dFull video of Colbert\u2019s roast is not available yet, but you can listen to the audio here, via Whispers in the Loggia:Please enable Javascript to watch.\n\u201cI believe the Pope is infallible, but he\u2019s also wrong about a lot of things\u2026 If Pope Francis were throwing tonight\u2019s party, we wouldn\u2019t be at white tie and the Waldorf, we\u2019d be in sweatpants crammed in the corner booth of the IHOP splitting a Rooty Tooty Fresh \u2018N Fruity.\u201dColbert also poked fun at Chris Matthews, telling the MSNBC host that \u201chaving \u2018Hardball\u2019 is now covered by Obamacare,\u201d and failed New York mayoral candidate Christine Quinn, saying \u201cNew York City is the only place in the world where the lesbian candidate is too conservative.\u201dAnd, of course, Colbert couldn\u2019t resist getting in some cracks at Michael Bloomberg."}
