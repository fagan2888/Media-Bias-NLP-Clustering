Conservatives are outraged that the same politicians who said, \u201cElect me and I will stand up to Obama,\u201d would actually vote to give him more power.\n\nHouse members are getting scorched from both the right and left. Labor is already running ads against Democrat House members Ami Berra and Kathleen Rice who are supporting ObamaTrade.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nNow Republicans are on notice: Obamatrade will be an issue next year, and if you don\u2019t get the picture, we\u2019ve made an ad to help you figure it out.\n\nFor ObamaTrade-loving incumbents who think they\u2019re safe because they have overwhelmingly Republican districts, we\u2019re here to tell you no one who betrays the will of the people is safe. Your vote on fast track will be an issue in the primary.\n\nThe politics of ObamaTrade are poisonous. Poll after poll shows a majority of Americans across the political spectrum oppose these phony \u201cfree trade\u201d deals \u2013 and conservatives oppose them in even greater numbers than Democrats.\n\nIt\u2019s especially toxic for Republicans because the white blue collar voters the GOP relies on to win elections positively loathe ObamaTrade. They correctly see it as part of the open borders agenda pitting them against cheap foreign labor. Whether the competition is from illegal/foreign guest workers at home or cheap foreign labor overseas, working Americans take it in the rear, as Mike Huckabee so succinctly put it.\n\nOur message to the traitor politician is clear: if you fast track ObamaTrade, the voters will throw you under the train. And we\u2019ll be there to help them.\n\nIn case these pols are too busy at fundraisers to get the picture, we\u2019ve put together a \u201cYour Name Could Be Here\u201d spot showing what\u2019s in store for them next year.\n\nWatch the :30 spot \u201cSurrender\u201d here.\n\nHere are a few a simple questions any Congressman can answer to find out if you\u2019ll be seeing our ad in your district next year.\n\nDid you promise voters to stand up against Obama\u2019s agenda but instead voted to give him more power? Did you bow to the man who brought us Obamacare, executive amnesty and more regulations? Did you vote to help Obama shred the Constitution, erase our borders, kill jobs and surrender our sovereignty and tax dollars to international authorities?\n\nIf you answered yes, congratulations! You\u2019re a candidate for a one-way ticket home on the Fast Track Express. All aboard!\n\nAnd when the Chamber of Cronies tells you they\u2019ll have your back, remember these two words: Eric Cantor.\n\nPrimaries are low turnout elections. A few thousand, even a few hundred, motivated voters can end the career of the most senior entrenched incumbent. And we\u2019ll be there to help them.\n\nIf you are a primary challenger, drop us a line. And if you want to help send a treasonous congressman a one-way ticket home, drop us a dime.\n\nSee you next year!\n\nCurtis Ellis is Executive Director of the American Jobs Alliance and served as communications director with the Campaign for Primary Accountability, the SuperPAC that unseated several long-term House incumbents in primary battles in 2012.
