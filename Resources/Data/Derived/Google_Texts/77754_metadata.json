He said the driver pulled into Littletown Park near Valencia and Craycroft. That's when, Peine said, the driver attempted to go between a row of yellow pylons but crashed soon after. The pylons were connected by cables and the truck had ripped out close to a dozen of them.\n\nAgents arrested the suspect without injury and seized several hundred pounds of marijuana, according to Peine.\n\nThe driver was alone in the vehicle, according to Peine.\n\nCopyright 2015 Tucson News Now.
