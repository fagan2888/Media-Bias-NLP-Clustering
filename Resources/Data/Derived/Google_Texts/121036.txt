Friday evening Sen. Marco Rubio addressed the the RedState Gathering. He followed in the shoes of Gov. Chris Christie, Gov. Rick Perry, Gov. Bobby Jindal, and debate champion Carly Fiorina, all of whom spoke before him. Among other things, he discussed how much the economy is changing and thus the importance of tax reform, regulatory reform, and jobs skills training in the 21st century. These are familiar themes. He also reiterated the importance of repealing Obamacare and balancing the federal budget and combating radical Islamic terrorism. But above all he offered an optimistic vision of America that has become a staple of his stump speech.

By the way, the general consensus was that Sen. Marco Rubio unofficially “won” the debate last night insofar as that was possible. For the most part, everyone performed well -- although few observers would disagree he stood out. I’ll leave you with one of the highlights of the night.
