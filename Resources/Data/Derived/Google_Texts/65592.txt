A mother whose daughters are living with an incurable illness has launched a fundraising campaign for the clinic that treats them.

Sharnia Mockford, 20, of Burwell, and Serena Mockford, 26, of Soham, both have Lupus, an illness of the immune system. The condition means the sisters have had to “give up on their hopes and dreams”, according to mum Martine.

She said: “Sharnia was a talented springboard and highboard diver, a National Junior Elite UK Silver and Bronze Medallist and a South African National Gold Medallist.

“Unfortunately Sharnia’s health deteriorated rapidly and she was unable to dive and could no longer attend college.”

Her other daughter Serena was working as a nurse at Addenbrooke’s and was set to study nursing at Homerton. But as she got ill, she lost her job and the place.

Both sisters regularly attend the Vasculitis and Lupus Centre at Addenbrooke’s where they receive life saving treatment.

Martine added: “I nearly lost Serena three times in the last six months, ending up in intensive care with an uncontrollable infection.

“She also started having seizures as lupus attacked her brain and she had two heart attacks in half an hour as the lupus caused embolisms and clots in her heart.

“Sharnia has been hospitalised a number of times for kidney infections and uncontrollable overall infections.”

Now Martine is fundraising for the clinic that regularly helps her daughters, and has been kindly supported by Cllr Michael Allen. She said: “Lupus is such a horrible illness and there’s not enough support there. There are very few clinics in the country which specialise so people come from far and wide.

“We spend a lot of time there waiting and we would love to do something to make that time more comfortable for people.”

To donate, go to fnd.us/c/akkVf. Or, send a cheque made payable to “ACT – Vasculitis”, writing “Lupus Martine Mockford” on the back and send it to 101 Ness Road, Burwell.
