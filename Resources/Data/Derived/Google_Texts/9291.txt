A national student group aimed at the Democrat-dominated youth vote is trying to use one of the biggest young-adult novels and movie in years to turn popular culture against the supposed “populism” of Obamacare.

The group, Turning Point USA, has published “The Health Care Games,” a look at the dystopian side of Obamacare economics with a title taken from the “Hunger Games” franchise – the wildly popular novel for young adults that became a movie sensation in 2012.

With the movie franchise next installment due out Nov. 21, as well as a new season of Obamacare beginning Nov. 15, it was a good time to bring out the book said Charlie Kirk, founder and executive director of Turning Point USA.

Using the “Hunger Games” as a hook seemed a logical way to reach coveted millennial voters who were reading the books as high schoolers.

“We felt if we could successfully bridge a deeper public policy argument against Obamacare and connect it with a widely popular novel and movie, “The Hunger Games,” we could connect with millennials in way that they would understand and message in a way they could relate to,” Kirk said.

“Just like the left has been doing for so long.”
