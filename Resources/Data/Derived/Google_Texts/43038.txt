ATLANTA (AP) - Talks to save the Atlanta Nobel peace summit aren’t going peacefully.

According to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution (http://on-ajc.com/1EYDnjI ), three board members of the local nonprofit tapped with hosting the planned summit - Jason Carter, Laura Turner Seydel and Willis Potts - resigned Friday amid conflicts with the nonprofit’s controversial CEO, Mohammad Bhuiyan.

Bhuiyan is the event’s lead organizer and head of Yunus Creative Lab.

Their departures are the latest chapter in an already tumultuous story of Atlanta’s plans to host an international peace summit for Nobel laureates this fall.

The Permanent Secretariat of The World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which spearheads annual gatherings of Nobel Peace Prize winners, said earlier this week that unless Atlanta leaders find a compromise soon, the organization will move the event elsewhere.

The Rome-based organization awarded the 2015 summit to Yunus Creative Lab in 2013.
