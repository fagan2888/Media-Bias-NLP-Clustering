These data and conclusions should be considered to be preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nWASHINGTON -- A single dose of an investigational influenza drug was able to reduce the duration of fever and viral shedding, researchers said here.\n\nIn a combined analysis of two randomized placebo-controlled trials, the neuraminidase inhibitor peramivir (Rapivab), given by injection within 48 hours of symptom onset, also lowered the amount of virus in the blood, according to Rich Whitley, MD, of the University of Alabama at Birmingham.\n\nBut while the drug reduced the time to resolution of symptoms -- the primary endpoint of the trials -- the difference from placebo was not statistically significant, Whitley said during a media event at the Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy here.\n\nNonetheless, the studies are sufficiently convincing they can be used to support a phase II trial, conducted in Japan and reported in 2010, that forms the basis of an application for FDA approval, said co-author William Sheridan, MBBS, chief medical officer of BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, of Research Triangle Park, N.C.\n\nThat 2010 study found that the drug significantly reduced the time to alleviation of symptoms, compared with placebo. The current studies reached that endpoint in an unadjusted analysis, but fell short of statistical significance after adjustment for smoking, influenza season, and type of flu, Sheridan said.\n\n\"The key is that the combined analysis supports the pivotal analysis because everything is the same direction,\" he told reporters.\n\nBioCryst is developing the drug, which is already licensed in Korea and Japan and has been given to more than 1 million patients in Japan.\n\nPeramivir can be given both by intramuscular injection or intravenous infusion, but the company is seeking an indication for intravenous use because the intramuscular (IM) shot \"hurts a fair bit,\" Sheridan said.\n\nThe two studies Whitley is presenting used the IM route, but other research from BioCryst presented here shows that both approaches are equivalent, Sheridan said.\n\nFor that reason, he said, the company is using them to back up the Japanese trial, which used intravenous infusions to deliver the drug. The infusions take between 15 and 30 minutes.\n\nThe other neuraminidase inhibitor in the public eye is oseltamivir (Tamiflu), which is given orally. Zanamivir (Relenza) is in delivered to the lungs using a nebulizer.\n\nWhile an oral drug is easy, some people might not be able to use it, Sheridan said, especially if one of their symptoms is nausea and vomiting, and there are also some people unable to take zanamivir.\n\nBut in general practice in the U.S., \"IV medications are going to be met with reluctance,\" commented Michael Schmidt, PhD, of the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston, who moderated the ICAAC session.\n\nOn the other hand, public health authorities might \"embrace it\" in emergencies, he told MedPage Today, and some institutions -- such as nursing homes -- might also find it useful as influenza prophylaxis.\n\nLarge metropolitan hospitals might also adopt the drug to protect staff, he said, \"if they have a hotspot outbreak where all of a sudden the [emergency department] is overwhelmed.\"\n\n\"The true utility of the drug, I think, is the single dose,\" he said, and it might be an important tool in the event of an outbreak of highly virulent pandemic flu.\n\nWhitley disclosed a relevant relationship with Gilead Sciences. Several co-authors disclosed relevant relationships with BioCryst.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Michael   Smith", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.medpagetoday.com/MeetingCoverage/ICAAC/47533", "image": "http://www.medpagetoday.com/upload/2014/9/7/47533.jpg", "description": "WASHINGTON -- A single dose of an investigational influenza drug, peramivir (Rapivab), was able to reduce the duration of fever and viral shedding, researchers said here.", "card": "Summary", "title": "One Dose of Flu Drug Shortens Fever"}, "dc.date.issued": "2014-09-06 22:41:43", "sailthru.is_cme": 0, "sailthru.tags": "uritheflu,infectiousdisease,primarycare,pulmonology,meetingcoverage,uristheflu,generalinfectiousdisease,generalprimarycare,icaac,hospitalbasedmedicine,nursing,nursing", "sailthru.date": "2014-09-06 22:41:43", "sailthru.title": "One Dose of Flu Drug Shortens Fever", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "verify-v1": "Vy2WQqSVx1yA90Uu2Rw12f2R8yqP7X0cxBFbafIuqao=", "sailthru.exclude": 1, "description": "WASHINGTON -- A single dose of an investigational influenza drug, peramivir (Rapivab), was able to reduce the duration of fever and viral shedding, researchers said here.", "sailthru.expire_date": "2014-09-07 22:09:43", "date": "2014-09-06 22:41:43", "sailthru.description": "WASHINGTON -- A single dose of an investigational influenza drug, peramivir (Rapivab), was able to reduce the duration of fever and viral shedding, researchers said here.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og": {"url": "http://www.medpagetoday.com/MeetingCoverage/ICAAC/47533", "image": "http://www.medpagetoday.com/upload/2014/9/7/47533.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "WASHINGTON -- A single dose of an investigational influenza drug, peramivir (Rapivab), was able to reduce the duration of fever and viral shedding, researchers said here.", "title": "One Dose of Flu Drug Shortens Fever"}, "sailthru.featured": 1, "dc.date": "2014-09-06 22:41:43", "sailthru.is_video": 0, "google-site-verification": "0uwxbLV_H5lccP3wm0UgRXFQ9w6ZQXh9ZLn-G0av8i0", "sailthru.speciality": "infectiousdiseases,pulmonarymedicine,primarycare,Other,hospitalmedicine", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.medpagetoday.com/upload/2014/9/7/47533.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9311\"", "article_summary": "WASHINGTON -- A single dose of an investigational influenza drug was able to reduce the duration of fever and viral shedding, researchers said here.\nFor that reason, he said, the company is using them to back up the Japanese trial, which used intravenous infusions to deliver the drug.\n\"The true utility of the drug, I think, is the single dose,\" he said, and it might be an important tool in the event of an outbreak of highly virulent pandemic flu.\nThe two studies Whitley is presenting used the IM route, but other research from BioCryst presented here shows that both approaches are equivalent, Sheridan said.\n\"The key is that the combined analysis supports the pivotal analysis because everything is the same direction,\" he told reporters."}
