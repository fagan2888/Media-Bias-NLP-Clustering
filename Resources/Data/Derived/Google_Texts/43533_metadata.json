He faced 18 batters over 64 pitches \u2014 his longest outing since early last season before he injured his shoulder.\n\n\u201cI had really good stuff with my slider and changeup,\u201d Chacin said. \u201cBut I had really poor location. I was leaving too much in the middle.\u201d\n\nAndre Ethier parked a two-run homer to deep left field in the first inning on a first-pitch, center-cut fastball. But Chacin was positive about his outing, saying he felt good physically, and didn\u2019t command the ball as well as he wanted.\n\nHe\u2019s less than nervous about his struggles, pointing to 2013 when he bombed the Cactus League, then pitched a career year in the regular season.\n\n\u201cI liked the fact that Jhoulys had more confidence in his fastball,\u201d Rockies manager Walt Weiss said. \u201cHe was at 64 pitches today. We wanted to extend him. And he responded well to that.\u201d\n\nChacin\u2019s placement in the Rockies\u2019 lineup is crucial. If he\u2019s not ready physically for the start of the season, or if he struggles early, Colorado will start in a hole (like where they left off last year) scrambling for replacement pitchers.\n\n\u201cThe big part of spring is building him back up and seeing how he responds between each start,\u201d Weiss said.\n\nHITS FROM SATURDAY\u2019S GAMES\n\nChad Bettis continues to pitch a solid comeback spring. He hasn\u2019t allowed a run in five innings total after a one-hit, three-inning effort against L.A\u2026 Infield prospect Trevor Story went 2-for-3 with an RBI triple at Salt River\u2026 Charlie Blackmon hit his first home run of the spring, against Cleveland\u2026 Corey Dickerson went 2-for-3 with a double at Goodyear.\n\nMISSES\n\nDrew Stubbs, hitting leadoff against the Dodgers, struck out three times\u2026 The Rockies left 11 on base against Cleveland, with Brandon Barnes, Wilin Rosario, Ben Paulsen, DJ LeMahieu and Cristhian Adames all going 0-for-3.\n\nUPDATES\n\nJustin Morneau, who hasn\u2019t played since Wednesday, is suffering from left elbow tendinitis. He\u2019s expected back this week\u2026 Troy Tulowitzki was scratched from the lineup for a rest day, Weiss said. He was replaced by prospect Emerson Jimenez at shortstop\u2026 The Rockies set a Salt River Fields attendance record with 13,126 fans Saturday.\n\nICYMI\n\nRockies owner Dick Monfort is part of an investors group that bough the Macaroni Grill restaurant chain last week for $8 million. It sold two years ago for $55 million.\n\nWHAT\u2019S NEXT\n\nKyle Kendrick, the Rockies\u2019 opening day starter, will pitch against Arizona and Robbie Ray in a 2:10 p.m. MT game at Salt River.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Andre Ethier,Cactus League,Jhoulys Chacin", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "On the Rox", "description": "Jhoulys Chacin, a would-be candidate to replace the injured Jorge De La Rosa in the Rockies home-opener, struggled through a split-squad game vs the Dodgers", "title": "Rockie's Jhoulys Chacin struggles vs. Dodgers in pitch-count jump", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/2015/03/21/jhoulys-chacin-struggles-against-dodgers-in-pitch-count-jump-for-rockies/19659/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/files/2015/03/jhoulys-chacin-rockies-495x321.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Jhoulys Chacin, a would-be candidate to replace the injured Jorge De La Rosa in the Rockies home-opener, struggled through a split-squad game vs the Dodgers", "title": "Jhoulys Chacin struggles against Dodgers in pitch-count jump for Rockies", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/2015/03/21/jhoulys-chacin-struggles-against-dodgers-in-pitch-count-jump-for-rockies/19659/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/files/2015/03/jhoulys-chacin-rockies-495x321.jpg", "creator": "@nickgroke", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "language": "en, sv", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Jhoulys Chacin, a would-be candidate to replace the injured Jorge De La Rosa in the Rockies home-opener, struggled through a split-squad game vs the Dodgers"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcfc3\"", "article_summary": "He was replaced by prospect Emerson Jimenez at shortstop\u2026 The Rockies set a Salt River Fields attendance record with 13,126 fans Saturday.\nWHAT\u2019S NEXTKyle Kendrick, the Rockies\u2019 opening day starter, will pitch against Arizona and Robbie Ray in a 2:10 p.m. MT game at Salt River.\n\u201cThe big part of spring is building him back up and seeing how he responds between each start,\u201d Weiss said.\nRockies (SS) 6, Dodgers 4 At Salt River FieldsCleveland 10, Rockies 5 At Goodyear ParkSCOTTSDALE, Ariz. \u2014 Jhoulys Chacin, a would-be candidate to replace the injured Jorge De La Rosa in the Rockies\u2019 home-opener, if it comes to that, struggled through a split-squad game against the Dodgers on Saturday.\n\u201cI liked the fact that Jhoulys had more confidence in his fastball,\u201d Rockies manager Walt Weiss said."}
