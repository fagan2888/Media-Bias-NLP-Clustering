All four of the victims have been recovered after the deadly plane crash at the FlightSafety International Cessna pilot training center have been recovered.

Three of the victims were inside the building and fire rescue crews were able to recover their remains after engineers and demolition crews were able to make that section of the building safe on Friday. The fourth victim was located on the roof, which was not deemed safe enough for emergency crews to gain access to until Saturday.

In addition, there were five people hurt in the crash. Four of them have been released.

Hotspots inside the building are still an issue for fire crews; fire crews will remain at the scene until they are no longer needed.
