During his remarks, Obama recalled episodes in Aurora, Colorado, and Newtown Connecticut, to again, suggest Americans seek tighter restrictions.\n\n\u201cFor too long, we\u2019ve been blind to the unique mayhem that gun violence inflicts upon this nation. Sporadically, our eyes are open,\u201d Obama said. \u201cBut I hope we also see the 30 precious lives cut short by gun violence in this country every single day.\u201d\n\nBush also told reporters that he was disappointed in both Supreme Court rulings from the last week that upheld President Obama\u2019s health care overhaul and legalized gay marriage nationwide.\n\nHe said he would repeal the health care law if elected, replacing it with high-deductible, low-premium catastrophic coverage.\n\nAs for gay marriage, Bush said he believes in traditional marriage between a man and a woman but indicated he wouldn\u2019t fight the court\u2019s ruling.\n\nHe said long-term loving relationships should be respected as well as a person\u2019s ability to express their religious beliefs.\n\nThis report was written by Kimberly Pierceall of the Associated Press.", "article_metadata": {"description": "New gun control measures are not the way to prevent mass killings such as the shooting deaths of nine people in a South Carolina church, Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush said Saturday", "pubdate": 20150628, "og": {"site_name": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "New gun control measures are not the way to prevent mass killings such as the shooting deaths of nine people in a South Carolina church, Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush said Saturday", "title": "Gun control not the way to prevent mass killings, Bush says", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/RTX1I2KD.jpg", "url": "http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/gun-control-way-prevent-mass-killings-bush-says/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "New gun control measures are not the way to prevent mass killings such as the shooting deaths of nine people in a South Carolina church, Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush said Saturday", "title": "Gun control not the way to prevent mass killings, Bush says", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/RTX1I2KD.jpg", "creator": "@newshour", "site": "@newshour", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"app_id": 114150878604116}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newshour", "tag": "town hall"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "gun control, Jeb Bush, mass shootings, PBS NewsHour Weekend, same-sex marriage, town hall"}, "article_summary": "Afterward, he told reporters gun control was an issue that should be sorted out at the state level.\nHENDERSON, Nev. \u2014 New gun control measures are not the way to prevent mass killings such as the shooting deaths of nine people in a South Carolina church, Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush said Saturday.\n\u201cFor too long, we\u2019ve been blind to the unique mayhem that gun violence inflicts upon this nation.\nAs for gay marriage, Bush said he believes in traditional marriage between a man and a woman but indicated he wouldn\u2019t fight the court\u2019s ruling.\nHe said long-term loving relationships should be respected as well as a person\u2019s ability to express their religious beliefs."}
