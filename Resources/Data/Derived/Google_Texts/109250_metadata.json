Wait. Cubs finally made the playoffs. So you must be an Illinois resident.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nAchieving a budget deal before 2016 looks to be a near impossibility. \u201cHighly unlikely,\u201d Illinois House Republican Leader Jim Durkin tells POLITICO. The Illinois House only has two more session days scheduled for the remainder of 2015. Gov. Bruce Rauner and legislative leaders haven\u2019t met since May. \u201cAt what point do they realize if they want to get through this they have to be willing to negotiate?\u201d\n\nSENATE DEMOCRATS AGREE ON TIMING: \u201cThere is zero sign that we\u2019re moving toward a resolution by the end of the year,\u201d said Rikeesha Phelon, spokeswoman to Senate President John Cullerton. \u201cAt this point there is no indication that that is possible.\u201d State Rep. Jack Franks, Democrat of Marengo, has called on Rauner to call a special session. \u201cThere\u2019s no chance of a budget unless the governor acts to bring a special session.\u201d Rauner has repeatedly said he\u2019s against it.\n\n-- The speaker\u2019s spox isn\u2019t sold: \u201cI hope that\u2019s not the case,\u201d says Speaker Mike Madigan spokesman Steve Brown on no budget until 2016.\n\n-- When Madigan and Rauner met last week, it was the \u201cfirst time in awhile\u201d Brown acknowledged. That\u2019s progress right? \u201cThe speaker told me there was no progress.\u201d The two men remained steadfast in their positions; Rauner will only agree to a tax increase if Democrats agree to his turnaround agenda. Madigan doesn\u2019t want to tie non-budget issues to a spending plan.\n\nWelcome to the POLITICO Illinois Playbook.

The mayor\u2019s also, look at his history, he knows the art of the deal. He\u2019s going to engage the governor and all the Democratic leaders to move all the parties together,\u201d Durkin tells POLITICO. \u201cAnyone who\u2019s relying on Springfield to solve their problems right now has to be aware of the toxic nature of the building.\u201d\n\nGOOD NEWS FOR STATE LAWMAKERS: You can finally take your summer break. Since May, Illinois House Speaker Mike Madigan said the House was in \u201ccontinuous session\u201d and called lawmakers down to Spring patch every week. Now the House has only scheduled two session days -- Oct. 20 and Nov. 10 for the remainder of the year. The Senate just moved its Oct. 6 session date to Oct. 20.\n\nILLINOIS LITERALLY CAN\u2019T KEEP LIGHTS ON: \u201cIllinois Secretary of State Jesse White has warned of ... the possibility that the electricity could be shut off at the Capitol \u2026 [W]arnings to suspend services already have come from computer and software contract vendors, a trash pickup entity and the armored truck company that picks up millions in cash each day from secretary of state facilities.\u201d AP: http://bit.ly/1KOEWkO\n\n...OR TRAIN COPS: \u201cHundreds of classes are being canceled at a time of heightened tension between police and the communities they serve, and as officers are increasingly the first to respond when a person with a mental illness is in crisis \u2026 \u2018The situation is becoming desperate,\u2019 said Eric Pingolt, who coordinates training in 11 counties for the Illinois Law Enforcement Training and Standards Board.\u201d AP: http://bit.ly/1iFgqvc\n\nHASTERT IN PLEA TALKS: Former U.S. House Speaker Denny Hastert\u2019s lawyers tell judge they\u2019re talking plea deal. No surprise Hastert would like to skip a public trial since that would be the best way to keep details of the case under wraps. He is, afterall, accused of paying $3.5 million to keep alleged sexual misconduct secret. \u201cA plea deal could have benefits for both sides. It might allow the identity of \u2018Individual A\u2019 to remain secret. It could also allow Hastert to avoid a detailed courtroom discussion of his alleged past misconduct and to receive a more lenient sentence than he would if convicted after a trial.\u201d By Josh Gerstein and Natasha Korecki, POLITICO http://politi.co/1KGma17\n\nRICH MILLER TO CRITICS: \u2018GO POUND SAND, FOR ALL I CARE\u2019. Miller, the author of the CapitolFax blog, made national news last week when U.S. Senator Mark Kirk preemptively attacked a Chicago Tribune reporter over a story the newspaper had not yet published. The blog published a memo and correspondence between the reporter and the campaign. \u201cAnd just in case you\u2019re wondering, I decided to run the piece because I thought it was a truly unique move with some special circumstances and gave my readers a fascinating look behind the scenes at how stories like these can develop. In other words, it was most definitely newsworthy as the national coverage clearly shows. My responsibility isn\u2019t to the Kirk campaign or to the Tribune. It\u2019s to my subscribers and my readers. Everyone else can go pound sand, for all I care.\u201d http://bit.ly/1KNVOaA\n\nWHY RAUNER SKIPPED OUT EARLY ON HOLOCAUST EVENT \u2026 \u201cGov. BRUCE RAUNER\u2019s early exit from a Holocaust remembrance at the Old State Capitol on April 16 was to go to his office to meet with legislative leaders, a spokeswoman now says. \u2026 Sometime after Rauner left that annual Holocaust observance in April, BRUCE RUSHTON, a reporter for Illinois Times, a Springfield weekly, asked for the governor\u2019s appointment calendar. Rushton wrote on illinoistimes.com last week that after the newspaper\u2019s request, \u201cRauner gave the newspaper a redacted version of his appointment calendar showing that he had attended a meeting in the governor\u2019s office while the ceremony continued.\u201d Names of those with whom he met were blacked out. The Illinois Times and Rushton filed a lawsuit against Rauner\u2019s office last week, seeking calendars with names.\u201d By Bernard Schoenburg, Springfield Journal-Register http://bit.ly/1iXvFjF\n\nPOLS BEHIND BARS: There\u2019s apparently so many high-profile Illinois felons doing time, the Chicago Sun-Times plots them out on a map. \u201cA sampling of where members of Illinois\u2019 high-profile criminal diaspora are behind bars.\u201d By Max Rust: http://bit.ly/1Rcj4Va\n\nHYDE PARK TAUGHT BERNIE SANDERS TO BE A SOCIALIST \u2026 \u201cLINES WERE AROUND THE BLOCK: for the sold-out event for the candidate seeking the Democratic presidential nomination as a self-identified socialist.\u201d By Sam Cholke and Kelly Bauer, DNAinfo http://dnain.fo/1O50LCM\n\nQUOTABLE: BERNIE SANDERS TELLS UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO STUDENTS: \u201cDo better than I did.\u201d\n\nVIDEO: Senate leaders Christine Radogno (GOP) and John Cullerton talk to Carol Marin on WTTW\u2019s Chicago Tonight: \u2018STATE BUDGET STANDOFF REACHES 90 DAYS\u2019 http://bit.ly/1KGnj8Z\n\nNAVY PIER Starts Taking Down Ferris Wheel: \u201cThe new wheel will rise 50 feet higher than the existing Ferris wheel, fit more passengers, and include climate-controlled gondolas.\u201d By David Matthews DNAinfo http://dnain.fo/1iFvrwT\n\nHOLD THE KETCHUP: Ohio Governor and GOP presidential hopeful JOHN KASICH stumps in Chicago Tuesday... we\u2019ll see if he follows Chicago code on hot dogs at noon at Portillo\u2019s on Ontario.\n\nCHICAGO CRIME: \u201c\u2018Pregnant mother, grandmother killed \u2014 infant, two others wounded in South Side shooting\u2019 --\u201cYou have an innocent family coming home from a family outing,\u201d Deputy Chief Eugene Roy told reporters at the scene. \u201cSomebody opens fire on two women, a child and two adults, killing the mother of the 11-month-old and the grandmother of the 11-month-old. \u201cIn a second, two generations of that child\u2019s family were wiped out.\u201d By Stefano Esposito, Alexandra Kukulka and Sam Charles, Chicago Sun-Times http://bit.ly/1MCsk31\n\n** A message from Nuclear Matters: Some of America\u2019s existing nuclear energy plants face early closure due to current economic and policy conditions. Providing more than 62% of America\u2019s carbon-free electricity, existing, state-of-the-art nuclear energy plants play a vital role in achieving our clean-energy and carbon reduction goals.\n\nIn Illinois, our nuclear energy plants provide 48 percent of the state\u2019s electricity and 90 percent of our carbon-free electricity. The existing nuclear energy plants also contribute nearly $9 billion to the economy and support approximately 28,000 direct and indirect jobs.\n\nBut today Illinois doesn\u2019t properly value these plants for their carbon-free contributions, placing them in economic jeopardy. Without support from Illinois policymakers for the Next Generation Energy Plan to close this gap, two plants \u2013 Clinton and Quad Cities \u2013 could be forced to close, jeopardizing thousands of jobs along with many other economic and environmental benefits.
