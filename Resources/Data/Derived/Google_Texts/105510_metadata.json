Halbert\n\nFORECASTS & TRENDS E-LETTER\n\nby Gary D. Halbert\n\nJune 30, 2015\n\nIN THIS ISSUE:\n\n1Q GDP Revised From Negative 0.7% to Negative 0.2% Current Recovery is Worst Since 1960, So Get Rid of GDP May Consumer Spending Rose the Most in Almost Six Years The Roberts\u2019 Supreme Court Overstepped Its Bounds, Again Justice Antonin Scalia Blasts Court\u2019s \u201cSCOTUScare\u201d Ruling Justice Antonin Scalia: America\u2019s \u2018Ruler\u2019 is Supreme Court\n\nOverview\n\nLast week the Supreme Court rendered two controversial landmark decisions, one on Obamacare subsidies and another on same-sex marriage. Both went in favor of the liberals on the Court, and many conservatives cried foul.\n\nWhile neither decision came as a surprise to me, Supreme Court observers on both the right and the left were surprised by the way the court went about making them. In both cases, there was a great deal of liberal \u201cinterpretation\u201d of the law, and in the same-sex marriage case, states\u2019 rights were trampled.\n\nToday, I will share a few of my thoughts on the landmark decisions last week. More importantly, I will share with you summaries of the \u201cdissents\u201d written by conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, one of my long-time favorites on the Court. He had some powerful thoughts on last week\u2019s decisions that I think you will appreciate.\n\nThere was one other troubling Supreme Court decision last week that you probably didn\u2019t hear about, but you should have. The ruling cracks down on housing discrimination, which sounds like a good thing. Yet this decision could lead to a new housing bubble and the next financial crisis, so you need to know about it. This story appears as the first link in SPECIAL ARTICLES.\n\nBefore we jump into the Supreme Court discussion, let\u2019s take a look at a couple of important economic reports released over the last week.\n\n1Q GDP Revised From to Negative 0.7% to Negative 0.2%\n\nLast Wednesday, the Commerce Department released its third estimate of 1Q GDP. The latest estimate for the January-March quarter was -0.2% (annual rate), slightly better than its second estimate of -0.7% last month.\n\nWith more complete data this month, the government said that exports decreased less than previously estimated, and consumer spending increased more than reported last month. There were also positive contributions from inventory investment and housing.\n\nWhile -0.2% represents an improvement over the previous estimate, a familiar pattern continues in the current expansion, in which several quarters of impressive growth are upended by a significant slowdown. The latest reading marks the fifth time in the six-year old recovery when the economy failed to achieve at least a 1% growth rate for a quarter.\n\nMost forecasters still expect a significant improvement in the economy in the 2Q; however anecdotal evidence in recent weeks suggests that the rebound may not be as strong as many have been suggesting. We don\u2019t get our first estimate of 2Q GDP until the end of July.\n\nCurrent Recovery is Worst Since 1960: Push to Scrap GDP\n\nNext, you should know that there is growing evidence of a strong push by the Obama administration, and its willful accomplices in the media, to get rid of GDP as the bellwether indicator of the economy. It is true that GDP, as currently measured, is lacking in a number of areas and fails to capture everything that is produced in our economy. Yet Gross Domestic Product is still the best indicator we have of the strength or weakness in the economy.\n\nThe weakness in GDP so far in 2015 merely extends the dismal track record of the 23-quarter post-Great Recession recovery. The annualized growth rate from 2008 to 2014 of just 1.13% is dead last compared to the six other post-recession recoveries since 1960, which averaged 3.97% after 23 quarters.\n\nThis is making President Obama and his policies look very bad, and he doesn\u2019t want that fact to be his legacy. No wonder they want to get rid of GDP and replace it with some other measurement that looks better. You\u2019ll be hearing more about this in the weeks and months just ahead.\n\nConsumer Spending Rose the Most in Almost Six Years\n\nOn a brighter note, household spending climbed in May by the most in almost six years, buoyed by gains in incomes as the US job market strengthened. Consumer spending increased 0.9% (annual rate) last month, the biggest gain since August 2009, after rising by only 0.1% in April, Commerce Department figures showed last Thursday.\n\nThe median forecast of 75 economists in a Bloomberg pre-report survey called for a 0.7% increase, so the report was better than expected. Incomes rose 0.5% for a second month. The better than expected boost in spending and income in May gave forecasters some renewed optimism that the economy may rebound in the 2Q.\n\nSpending on durable goods, including automobiles, increased 2.3% in May, following a 0.1% drop in April, Thursday\u2019s data showed. Purchases of non-durable goods, which include gasoline, rose 0.9%, while outlays on services climbed 0.2%.\n\nAuto sales have been boosting the spending figures, with cheap financing helping to spur Americans\u2019 appetites for vehicles. Industry data from Ward\u2019s Automotive Group issued earlier this month showed cars and light trucks sold at a 17.7 million annualized rate in May, the strongest pace since July 2005.\n\nLet\u2019s hope this good news continues. Now let\u2019s move on to our main topic today, the latest Supreme Court decisions.\n\nThe Roberts\u2019 Supreme Court Overstepped Its Bounds, Again\n\nLike many conservatives, I disagreed with last week\u2019s two landmark decisions by the Supreme Court. But more irritating than the decisions themselves was the way the High Court went about making them. In the Obamacare case, King v. Burwell, the challengers argued that it is unconstitutional for the federal government to provide health insurance subsidies to people who live in states that did not set up their own insurance exchanges.\n\nThe language in the Affordable Care Act specifically states that such subsidies are allowed only in exchanges \u201cestablished by the State.\u201d The defense argued that the phrase included the federal government and not just the individual states. Without these federal subsidies in states that do not have exchanges, Obamacare would not be able to survive.\n\nFor the second time in three years, Chief Justice John Roberts (a George W. Bush appointee) sided with the court\u2019s liberals to uphold that key interpretation of Obamacare and saved it once again. Adding insult to injury for the right: Roberts again wrote the opinion for the majority, stressing that the intent \u2013 not the wording \u2013 of the law was more important. In other words, that was what the lawmakers in Congress meant to say, in his opinion.\n\nBut how does Chief Justice Roberts, or any of the other justices really know what Congress meant to say? They don\u2019t but they ruled as they did anyway. How is this justice? It\u2019s not.\n\nNext, in the gay marriage decision, I was not totally surprised that the High Court ruled in favor of same-sex marriages. What bothered many conservatives most was the fact that, before this ruling, 37 states already had some kind of law making gay marriage legal. This had always been an issue for the states to decide,\n\nSign up for our free newsletter", "article_metadata": {"description": "Last week the Supreme Court rendered two controversial landmark decisions, one on Obamacare subsidies and another on same-sex marriage.", "generator": "WPZOOM Framework 1.6.0", "og": {"site_name": "ValueWalk", "description": "Last week the Supreme Court rendered two controversial landmark decisions, one on Obamacare subsidies and another on same-sex marriage.", "title": "Obamacare: Roberts' Supreme Court Overstepped It's Bounds", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 624, "identifier": "http://www.valuewalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Obamacare-2.png", "height": 361}, "updated_time": "2015-07-03T08:18:03+00:00", "url": "http://www.valuewalk.com/2015/07/obamacare-scotus/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Obamacare: Roberts\u2019 Supreme Court Overstepped It\u2019s Bounds, Again by Gary D.
