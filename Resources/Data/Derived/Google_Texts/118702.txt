As has been their business model, the Broncos are low-keying their send off to Super Bowl XLVIII.

However, if fans want to wish the team well, show up at the rear of the team’s headquarters on Sunday morning. There’s an area along Potomac Street between the outside of the players’ gated parking lot and the Broncos team store.

The staff bus will roll out at 9:30 a.m. Sunday with the player and coaches buses — note the photo is not of their actual buses — exiting about 10 a.m. Sunday. The Broncos will charter out of DIA around 11 a.m. Sunday and land at the Newark airport between 3:30 and 4 p.m. ET.

At that point, the Broncos’s seventh Super Bowl appearance is on.
