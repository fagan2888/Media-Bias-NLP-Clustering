Workers and students merely would have to show their ID badge when boarding buses, shuttles and trolleys. In exchange, the city and the college would pay PSTA a set amount each year based on a break-even cost for the estimated number of passengers.\n\nPSTA also has approached other local colleges, including University of South Florida St. Petersburg and Eckerd College, and officials say the program also could be extended to local employers. The plan is based on projections that new riders will fill up spare seats on existing routes without the need for additional buses.\n\n\u201cPSTA generates more revenue and we get more riders,\u201d PSTA CEO Brad Miller said. \u201cThey\u2019re filling up existing seats on the bus so it\u2019s not costing PSTA any money to carry those riders to their destinations.\u201d\n\nThe agency still is in talks with SPC to finalize an agreement that would cover the college\u2019s nine locations beginning in the fall. On Wednesday, its governing board approved an initial $28,000 contract with St. Petersburg that would cover the 2015 fiscal year. The cost would rise each year by about 2.5, or 3 percent, Miller said.\n\nThe city\u2019s program could begin as soon as August. Council Member Wengay Newton, who also serves on PSTA\u2019s board, said free rides particularly would benefit students who cannot afford a car.\n\n\u201cA lot of those young people don\u2019t own cars because of the high insurance and the car payments and the responsibilities,\u201d Newton said. \u201cYou can\u2019t buy ramen noodles if you\u2019re paying parking tickets.\u201d\n\nUPASS programs already are common in many other communities with transit systems.\n\nMiller said they encourage ridership particularly among people who don\u2019t know how much bus fares cost or who fret about having the right change.\n\nAlthough rides are subsidized heavily, passenger fares make up roughly 23 percent of PSTA\u2019s revenue, bringing in about $14 million per year.\n\nThe UPASS contracts include a clause allowing PSTA to renegotiate costs if extra riders lead to routes becoming over-crowded.\n\nEvan Mory, St. Petersburg director of transportation and parking management, said UPASS makes sense for the city, which pays about $25,000 a year toward purchasing bus passes for 54 workers who participate in a city program that encourages employees to leave their cars at home. The workers each pay $20 per month toward the cost.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a no-brainer,\u201d Mory said. \u201cIt works out to be a very good deal for the city.\u201d\n\ncodonnell@tampatrib.com\n\n(727) 215-7654\n\nTwitter: @codonnellTBO", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sat, 28 Jun 2014 19:29:15 -0400", "Description": "ST.
