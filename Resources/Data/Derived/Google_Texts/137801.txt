Tyler made his debut on "Meet The Press Daily" on Friday where he spoke out for the first time about his firing, expressing regret for an "error" in judgement before being let go from the campaign.

ADVERTISEMENT "I'm not mad about it. I'm fine with it," Tyler said of the political fallout during an interview with Chuck Todd.

Tyler said that members of Cruz's team took him out for a farewell of sorts following his firing, joking, "It was a little bit like being at your own funeral."

Tyler had issued a public apology and appeared on national television to take responsibility for sharing the story, which had featured a video that falsely quoted Rubio using subtitles.
