There\u2019s a ventriloquist\u2019s act going on here. So when you hear people like E.W. Jackson or Ben Carson or Allen West speak about slavery in relation to the Affordable Care Act, they are not giving you serious history.\u201d\n\nDyson also took on the August 2013 remarks by a GOP congressional candidate linking the law to the Fugitive Slave Act.\n\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act and the Fugitive Slave Act: both laws. But I want to make one thing absolutely clear: the similarities end there,\u201d Dyson said. \u201cSlavery was one of the most dehumanizing acts of American history. It was a systemic attempt to deprive people of the privilege of existing freely. It made one group of people subordinate to another. It made race the central preoccupation of America.\u201d\n\nFor a more thoughtful analysis, Dyson recommended viewers read Orlando Patterson\u2019s Slavery and Social Death, which deals with the actual effects of slavery, like genealogical isolation, which left victims unable to know their family history, or the phenomena of \u201csocial death,\u201d in which authorities did not recognize a slave\u2019s basic humanity.\n\n\u201cThe only thing that is comparable to slavery is slavery itself,\u201d Dyson said. \u201cStop all the stuff. Ixnay on the comparative analysis of and the parallels to slavery. [The] Affordable Care Act has freed millions of people from their indentured existence in a system that denied them opportunity. Let\u2019s not talk about their enslavement; let\u2019s talk about their relative freedom to exercise their choice in 2013.\u201d\n\nWatch Dyson take on the conservative argument against Obamacare, as aired Thursday on MSNBC, below.\n\n[Image via MSNBC]", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "height": 430}, "title": "MSNBC host destroys Ben Carson\u2019s slavery \u2018ventriloquist\u2019s act\u2019 on Obamacare"}, "fb": {"app_id": 212555972273585}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb8bd\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe Affordable Care Act and the Fugitive Slave Act: both laws.\n[The] Affordable Care Act has freed millions of people from their indentured existence in a system that denied them opportunity.\n\u201cThe only thing that is comparable to slavery is slavery itself,\u201d Dyson said.\nJackson or Ben Carson or Allen West speak about slavery in relation to the Affordable Care Act, they are not giving you serious history.\u201dDyson also took on the August 2013 remarks by a GOP congressional candidate linking the law to the Fugitive Slave Act.\nDr. Ben Carson on MSNBC 032913MSNBC guest-host Michael Eric Dyson picked apart conservative rhetoric linking the Affordable Care Act to the slave trade, honing in on Dr. Ben Carson\u2019s statement that, \u201cit is slavery, in a way.\u201d\u201cEven if black men talk about slavery akin to the Affordable Care Act, they are wrong,\u201d Dyson said while hosting The Ed Show on Thursday."}
