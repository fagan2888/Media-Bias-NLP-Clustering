In her mid-50s, she had been battling breast cancer for years, but it had spread to her bones, causing unrelenting pain that required hospitalization. Jeremy Force, a first-year oncology fellow at Duke University Medical Center who had never met the woman, was assigned to stop by her room last November to discuss her decision to enter hospice. Employing the skills he had just learned in a day-long course, Force sat at the end of her bed and listened intently. The woman wept, telling him she was exhausted and worried about the impact her death would have on her two daughters. \u201cI acknowledged how hard what she was going through was,\u201d Force said of their 15-minute conversation, \u201cand told her I had two children, too,\u201d and that hospice was designed to provide her additional support. A few days later, he ran into the woman in the hall. \u201cYou\u2019re the best physician I\u2019ve ever worked with,\u201d Force remembers her telling him. \u201cI was blown away,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was such an honor.\u201d\n\nForce credits \u201cOncotalk,\u201d a course required of Duke\u2019s oncology fellows, for the unexpected accolade. Developed by medical faculty at Duke, the University of Pittsburgh, and several other medical schools, \u201cOncotalk\u201d is part of a burgeoning effort to teach doctors an essential but often overlooked skill: clinical empathy. Unlike sympathy, which is defined as feeling sorry for another person, clinical empathy is the ability to stand in a patient\u2019s shoes and to convey an understanding of the patient\u2019s situation as well as the desire to help. Clinical empathy was once dismissively known as \"good bedside manner\" and regarded as far less important than technical acumen. Clinical empathy was once dismissively known as \u201cgood bedside manner\u201d and traditionally regarded as far less important than technical acumen. But a spate of studies in the past decade has found that it is no mere frill. Increasingly, empathy is considered essential to establishing trust, the foundation of a good doctor-patient relationship. Studies have linked empathy to greater patient satisfaction, better outcomes, decreased physician burnout, and a lower risk of malpractice suits and errors. Beginning this year, the Medical College Admission Test will contain questions involving human behavior and psychology, a recognition that being a good doctor \u201crequires an understanding of people,\u201d not just science, according to the American Association of Medical Colleges. Patient satisfaction scores are now being used to calculate Medicare reimbursement under the Affordable Care Act. And more than 70 percent of hospitals and health networks are using patient satisfaction scores in physician-compensation decisions. While some people are naturally better at being empathic, said Mohammadreza Hojat, a research professor of psychiatry at Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia, empathy can be taught. \u201cEmpathy is a cognitive attribute, not a personality trait,\u201d said Hojat, who developed the Jefferson Scale of Empathy, a tool used by researchers to measure it.\n\n\u201cThe pressure is really on,\u201d said psychiatrist Helen Riess. The director of the empathy and relational science program at Massachusetts General Hospital, she designed \u201cEmpathetics,\u201d a series of online courses for physicians. \u201cThe ACA and accountability for health improvement is really heightening the importance of a relationship\u201d between patients and their doctors when it comes to boosting adherence to treatment and improving health outcomes. \u201cDemographics and economics are driving this,\u201d said James A. Tulsky, one of the developers of \u201cOncotalk.\u201d (The original course for oncologists has been adapted for other specialties under the aegis of Vital Talk.) \u201cBaby boomers have higher expectations\u201d and are less willing to tolerate doctors they consider arrogant or unapproachable, added Tulsky, director of the Duke Center for Palliative Care. A 2011 study he headed found that doctors who took the course inspired greater trust in their patients than those who did not. One study found that, on average, doctors interrupt patients within 18 seconds. While empathy courses are rarely required in medical training, interest in them is growing, experts say, and programs are underway at Jefferson Medical College and at Columbia University School of Medicine. Columbia has pioneered a program in narrative medicine, which emphasizes the importance of understanding patients\u2019 life stories in providing compassionate care. While the curricula differ, most focus on self-monitoring by doctors to reduce defensiveness, improve listening skills (one study found that, on average, doctors interrupt patients within 18 seconds), and decode facial expressions and body language. Some programs use actors as simulated patients and provide feedback to individual doctors. \u201cIn the 1980s, when I trained, the emphasis was on medical knowledge and technical skills,\u201d said Debra Weinstein, the vice president for graduate medical education at Partners HealthCare, the largest provider of medical services in Massachusetts. But in the past decade, \u201cthe profession has been more attuned to patient satisfaction and the connection between satisfaction and outcomes and incentives.\u201d\n\nPartners, which includes Mass General and other Harvard teaching hospitals, is requiring that its 2,000 residents take \u201cEmpathetics.\u201d In a 2012 study involving 100 residents, researchers found that doctors randomly assigned to take the course were judged by patients as significantly better at understanding their concerns and making them feel at ease than residents who had not undergone the training. Riess said that while some doctors have told her they don\u2019t have the time to be empathic, the skill has proved to be a timesaver rather than a time sink. It can help doctors zero in on the real source of a patient\u2019s concern, short-circuiting repeated visits or those \u201cdoorknob moments\u201d doctors dread, when the patient says \u201cOh, by the way ...\u201d and raises the primary concern as the doctor is headed out of the room. Related Story Four Words to Seem More Polite Because a lack of empathy and poor communication drive many malpractice cases, a large malpractice insurer, MMIC, is urging doctors it insures to take the \u201cEmpathetics\u201d course. Another benefit: Empathy training appears to combat physician burnout. \u201cEmpathy training is naturally self-rewarding,\u201d said Laurie Drill-Mellum, a former emergency-room doctor who is the chief medical officer of the Minneapolis-based insurer. \u201cIt gives [doctors] the love back,\u201d she said, referring to the positive feedback empathic doctors receive from their patients. Both Riess and Tulsky say their interest in empathy was sparked by personal experience. In Riess\u2019 case, it was the flood of patients in her psychiatric practice a decade ago who spent their time in therapy discussing devastating interactions with doctors. \u201cThese are not just innocuous effects,\u201d she said, \u201cbut often experiences that were profound and deeply affected people\u2019s lives.\u201d Tulsky said that his father, an obstetrician-gynecologist in a solo practice, routinely talked about his patients at dinner. \u201cHis stories were about their lives, so I got this idea that medicine was about more than the illness,\u201d he recalled. In medical school, Tulsky said, \u201cI was very drawn to challenging moments in patients\u2019 lives and volunteered to give bad news,\u201d particularly when he believed other doctors would botch it.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"Being a good doctor requires an understanding of people, not just science.\"", "author": "Sandra G.
