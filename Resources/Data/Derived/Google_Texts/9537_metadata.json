(AP) - The 1980s were a great breeding ground for, among other things, high school rock bands starting up in the basements of family homes. Thirty years later, few bands are still rocking. The Savage Brothers Band is an exception.\n\nFour brothers - Tom, Mark, Steve, and Mike Savage - founded the band in 1984 in the basement of their Windsor Locks home. One month later, they were playing live gigs in Hartford and Manchester and gaining a steady following.\n\nThe band recently celebrated its 30th anniversary at Joanna\u2019s Caf\u00e9 and Banquet Hall in Somers, adding one more show to its roster of more than 5,000. The group currently consists of Tom (saxophone, vocals, flute), Mark (trumpet and vocals), and Mike Savage (drums), as well as Frank Cook (lead guitar), Keith Kruser (vocals, keys, guitar), and Les Haley (bass and vocals). Steve Savage left the band two years ago to pursue other interests.\n\nThe June 6 celebration at Joanna\u2019s drew a sold-out crowd of at least 400. Had it been held at a larger venue, that number could have easily been doubled, Tom Savage, the band\u2019s manager and eldest member, said.\n\n\u201cBut this isn\u2019t about the money or attendance numbers, as much as it is to say \u2018thank you,\u2019\u201d said Tom, 51, who has two daughters and lives in Somers.\n\nAside from band fandom, Tom is grateful for the support he\u2019s received from the community. Last summer, he was diagnosed with cancer of the esophagus and liver. This past fall, the field hockey team at Timothy Edwards Middle School in South Windsor, where Tom teaches music and directs several of its student bands, raised $5,500 to benefit the St. Francis Hospital Patient Care Fund for those undergoing cancer treatment.\n\nAmazingly, Tom\u2019s condition has not prevented him from singing and playing music, nor teaching it.\n\nWith the cancer at stage 4, his doctors are unsure exactly how long Tom has to live; it could be months or years, he said. He uses this uncertainty as motivation to perform at the highest level on stage and in the classroom.\n\n\u201cThe cancer could get me whenever, but music is an outlet that pushes me to keep going,\u201d he said. \u201cThe band will go on.\u201d\n\nAnd teaching has been his lifeline.\n\n\u201cTeaching is very rewarding for me, it helps me forget about the cancer,\u201d he added. \u201cI want to get kids to understand the important place music has in our society.\u201d\n\nThe other members of the Savage Brothers Band also work other jobs. Haley, 45, of Mystic, is a freelance musician; Cook, 44, of Windsor Locks, works for UPS; Kruser, 45, of Agawam, Massachusetts, is a consultant with ATC Audio in West Springfield and plays with another band, Guitar Dudes; Mark, 49, of Windsor Locks, is a computer technician; and Mike, 46, is a private music instructor in Windsor.\n\nThe Savage Brothers Band, which plays weddings as well as concerts, is thankful for a strong fan base throughout Connecticut. The band has more than 6,500 fans on Facebook and hordes of dedicated followers who attend its concerts.\n\n\u201cWe knew 90 percent of the people at (the 30th anniversary) show,\u201d Tom said. \u201cIt\u2019s a privilege to have a business in which you know so many people who believe in what you do.\u201d\n\nThe fans at Joanna\u2019s Cafe were a good mix of originals and newbies, but all were equally ecstatic to be celebrating the band\u2019s milestone.\n\n\u201cI heard them two years ago in Nantucket and loved the music,\u201d said Michelle Romanella of North Branford. \u201cThen I met them after the show and I was hooked.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe whole family is wonderful, they\u2019re just very cool people,\u201d said Jean Pogalitsch of Vernon.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of music running through the Savage family\u2019s bloodline. The patriarch, Joe Savage, 80, was in a band of his own in the 1950s and had his sons taking private music lessons at the University of Hartford before they reached high school.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always thought they\u2019ve had the talent to play with the best of \u2018em,\u201d said the elder Savage, before joining his sons on stage to sing the closing song at Joanna\u2019s during the 30th anniversary show, Bobby Darin\u2019s \u201cMack The Knife.\u201d\n\nTom singled out his parents, Joe and Bernadette, 78, as his biggest musical influence, remembering how they would always be playing jazz or swing in their Windsor Locks home, where they still live. Joe would sing and Bernadette would dance, and eventually the children started to get involved.\n\n\u201cThose times were a huge influence on how we appreciated music, and as we grew up we incorporated that into our style,\u201d Tom said.\n\nWith a great mix of shrill trumpet and sax, passionate vocals, and hard-hitting drums and bass, the Savage Brothers Band is able to cover a wide array of tunes. At Joanna\u2019s, they did justice to funky classics like \u201cBrick House\u201d and \u201cPlay That Funky Music\u201d and showed versatility with country jams such as \u201cSave a Horse (Ride a Cowboy)\u201d and \u201cWagon Wheel.\u201d\n\nA resurgence in funk/disco music on pop radio has boded well for the Savage Brothers. The band has mastered a cover of Robin Thicke\u2019s smash hit \u201cBlurred Lines,\u201d which melted hearts at its recent performance for Simsbury High School\u2019s Senior Ball.\n\n\u201cTheir music seems to inspire people of all generations,\u201d said Joe Metta of the Broad Brook section of East Windsor, who\u2019s been a fan since the very beginning.\n\n\u201cSo much of the music you hear today is synthesized but they make such a natural sound,\u201d Metta said.\n\nDespite the growing popularity of computer-made music, that \u201cconsistently perfect sound\u201d will never replace the experience of a live concert, Tom said.\n\nThat being said, Tom acknowledged that the music industry has changed significantly since innovations like MTV and the Internet.\n\n\u201cBefore MTV, the only way you could see what a band looked like was to see them live,\u201d he explained. \u201cNow people can sit and enjoy the musical experience from the comfort of their homes.\u201d\n\nThe Savage Brothers Band has remained solid because of its musical versatility, as well as its willingness to play in a variety of settings. The band has been playing everything from weddings to clubs to concerts on the green, private parties, fundraisers, and more, Tom said.\n\nThe band plays familiar covers at most gigs, but it also has a catalog of original songs. Its most recent album, \u201cPopulation 6,\u201d has sold more than 5,000 copies since its 1992 release.\n\nSome of the band\u2019s fondest memories include opening for Los Lonely Boys and Tower of Power, when it got great receptions from crowds of several thousand people. One not-so-great gig was around 25 years ago at Post University in Waterbury, where the band played to an empty field in the cold, pouring rain.\n\n\u201cWe call those the \u2018humble gigs,\u2019\u201d Tom said.\n\nSuch \u201chumble gigs\u201d probably won\u2019t be an issue for the Savage Brothers Band from here on out. Demand for its funkin,\u2019 rockin\u2019 rhythm is as steady as ever, with 15 shows already booked for 2015.\n\nThis year has several dozen more shows left on the band\u2019s schedule.\n\nThe band plans to continue playing as long as its members are able to balance band life with family life, teaching, parenting, UPS driving, and the rest of their endeavors.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Journal Inquirer, http://www.journalinquirer.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "The 1980s were a great breeding ground for, among other things, high school rock bands starting up in the basements of family homes.
