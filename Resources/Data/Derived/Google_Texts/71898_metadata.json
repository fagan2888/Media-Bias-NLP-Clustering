Seventeen percent said the same of the economy in general, while 15 percent named unemployment and jobs as the top concern.\n\nAfter the broken Obamacare promises, messy Healthcare.gov rollout and Jonathan Gruber\u2019s infamous remarks, it\u2019s no surprise that health care emerged as the fourth most pressing issue of 2014.\n\nImmigration followed close behind with 8 percent, though Americans were unevenly concerned about the issue throughout 2014. For instance, immigration was named the most pressing issue by a whopping 17 percent in July amid the southern border crisis.\n\nThough race relations were cited most months by only 2 percent or less as the most vital concern, that percentage spiked to 13 percent in December as protests heightened against the Michael Brown and Eric Garner grand jury decisions. The issue averaged 3 percent for 2014.\n\nAlas, Americans are most concerned about the way in which President Obama and Congress govern the country, which likely speaks to the reason for which voters turned out in support of Republican candidates during the midterm election.\n\nStill, if Republicans want to solve America\u2019s most important problem, they\u2019ll need to prove to voters that they can pass legislation that matters \u2014 bills concerning the Keystone XL pipeline and American jobs, for example \u2014 and reverse the stalled nature that has become typical of Washington.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Poor government leadership was the overall most important issue facing the United States in 2014, according to a Gallup analysis of its monthly polls throughout the year.", "title": "Poor leadership in government top issue of 2014, poll says - Red...", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2014/11/Obama-Congress_Chal-600x400.jpg", "height": 400}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2015/01/02/poor-leadership-government-top-issue-2014-poll-says/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "unemployment", "published_time": "2015-01-02T15:20:42+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-02T15:20:42+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddb85\"", "article_summary": "Poor government leadership was the overall most important issue facing the United States in 2014, according to a Gallup analysis of its monthly polls throughout the year.\nFor instance, immigration was named the most pressing issue by a whopping 17 percent in July amid the southern border crisis.\nOn average in 2014, 18 percent of Americans said that the government, Congress and politicians were the most important issue.\nAfter the broken Obamacare promises, messy Healthcare.gov rollout and Jonathan Gruber\u2019s infamous remarks, it\u2019s no surprise that health care emerged as the fourth most pressing issue of 2014.\nImmigration followed close behind with 8 percent, though Americans were unevenly concerned about the issue throughout 2014."}
