John Cooper, the newly elected Republican senator from the 21st state senate district, won the January 14th special election in a landslide \u2013 taking 57-percent of the vote.\n\nThe odd thing is, the 21st district is a heavily Democratic-aligned district. In 2010 it went 68 percent for Democrat Governor Mike Beebe. In fact, the Jonesboro-based senate seat hasn\u2019t been held by a Republican in nearly 150 years. Cooper\u2019s victory begs the question, what happened, and what does it all mean?\n\nJohn Cooper, a retired AT&T employee, wouldn\u2019t strike most seasoned political observers as the kind of guy you\u2019d want to run for office in what was thought of as a Democrat district. His campaign focused on his opposition to tax hikes \u2013 he was a signer of ATR\u2019s Taxpayer Protection Pledge \u2013 and his opposition to Obamacare \u2013 specifically the bipartisan, Republican leadership-backed Arkansas Private Option (Medicaid expansion). In short, Cooper ran as the conservative\u2019s conservative.\n\nCooper\u2019s opponent was Sam Rockwell. Rockwell was a local small-business owner and attempted to paint himself as a Democrat centrist \u2013 much like Arkansas\u2019s U.S. Senator Mark Pryor and gubernatorial candidate \u2013 and former-Congressman \u2013 Mike Ross. The \u201ccentrist with community roots\u201d shtick didn\u2019t work out too well for Rockwell, and that should strike fear into the hearts of both Pryor and Ross in their 2014 contests. Moreover, it should sound alarm bells for a retreating Arkansas Democratic Party and Democratic Senate candidates across the nation.\n\nUntil 1969, the Arkansas state senate was entirely controlled by Democrats. By 2012, for the first time since Reconstruction, Republicans took control of both the Arkansas House of Representatives and the State Senate. Previously, the 2010 elections saw Republicans take control of all four of Arkansas\u2019s congressional seats. On the state level, the last bastion of the Southern Democrats appears to have fallen. The state that elected Bill Clinton as governor, Mark Pryor as a U.S. Senator, and Mike Ross as a congressman is a blue state no more.\n\nOn a national level, the election of John Cooper serves as a dire warning for Mark Pryor. Facing Republican Congressman Tom Cotton in the U.S. Senate race, Pryor needs to manage a decent performance in the 21st state senate district. Prior to the election, the liberal blog Daily Kos noted: \u201cOn the politics side of things, this election is huge. Craighead County is a key area of the state for both Mark Pryor and Mike Ross to win (they need to get at minimum 49 percent of the vote in this county to win the state) If Rockwell can\u2019t put up a decent showing, Democrats are going to have some serious issues going into 2014.\u201d With the election now over, it can be safely said that Rockwell did not put up a decent showing \u2013 unless you would call a 15-point blow-out decent. Even more telling is that Cooper did not run as a moderate and specifically targeted the signature Democrat achievement in recent years, Obamacare.\n\nIn U.S. Senate races across the country, incumbent Democrats are on the record parroting President Obama\u2019s 2013 Lie of the Year, \u201cIf you like your plan, you can keep it. Period.\u201d Republican challengers would be smart to take a lesson from John Cooper\u2019s victory and not shy away from hammering home their opponents\u2019 support of Obamacare. With national approval for Obamacare sinking \u2013 the Real Clear Politics average is at 39.9-percent in favor, 55.4-percent against \u2013 John Cooper\u2019s victory may have been the Democrats\u2019 canary in the coal mine moment.
