What do Yahoo, Olive Garden and Staples have in common?\n\nAnswer: A hedge fund called Starboard Value LLP is having outsized influence over their futures.\n\nStarboard is the big money behind some of the most significant deals in recent months, like Wednesday\u2019s news that Staples is buying Office Depot for $6.3 billion or Yahoo\u2019s announcement in late January that it would spin off its Alibaba stake valued at a whopping $40 billion. Both deals were, in many ways, at the behest of the hedge fund.\n\nLaunched in 2002, Starboard\u2019s hallmark is so-called activist investing. That means it doesn\u2019t just buy stakes in companies it thinks are undervalued and wait for the rest of the market to catch on. Instead, it buys shares in companies it believes have undervalued assets and then pressures management to do what it thinks will unlock that value.\n\nLately, the executives and directors at companies targeted by Starboard are proving quick to act when the fund lays on the pressure. It was only last month that Starboard called on Staples and Office Depot to merge, betting that they could save money and better compete against Amazon and Wal-Mart by combining operations. Staples, for its part, says it began talks to buy Office Depot last September.\n\nRelated: Einhorn vs. Apple: The Value of Activist Investors\n\nStarboard had a 5.1 percent stake in Staples and a 10 percent stake in Office Depot, which it started buying back in 2013, when it was pushing a merger with OfficeMax. Staples\u2019 stock (NASDAQ:SPLS) skyrocketed when rumors of the pending merger first broke Tuesday, although it fell back on the actual announcement Wednesday. Office Depot (NASDAQ:ODP) shares jumped about 10 percent on the rumor and have held those gains. That\u2019s a tidy profit for Starboard.\n\nStarboard doesn\u2019t have a huge stake in Yahoo (that it has disclosed yet, anyway), but it nonetheless has had CEO Marissa Mayer squarely in its sites for months. Starboard has publicly pushed its plan for Yahoo to spin off its stake in Alibaba, sell its Yahoo Japan holding and then merge with AOL. Mayer may be hoping that the firm will leave her alone now that she\u2019s agreed to sell the Alibaba stake. If Yahoo merged with AOL, it\u2019s likely AOL\u2019s CEO Tim Armstrong who would end up in the top job, not Mayer.\n\nManagement doesn\u2019t always rush to do Starboard\u2019s bidding, though. When it bought a 5.6 percent stake in Darden Restaurants (NYSE:DRI) in late 2013, Starboard wanted to spin off the restaurant operator\u2019s real estate holdings into a separately traded company. But Darden management foiled that plan by selling Red Lobster, and its real estate with it.\n\nPunishment was swift. Not only did Starboard sue, but it also led a proxy contest that resulted in all 12 Darden directors being replaced with Starboard\u2019s own slate, which includes Starboard\u2019s chief executive, Jeff Smith.\n\nStarboard assets total about $3 billion, tiny in comparison to the market caps of some of the companies it targets. Nonetheless, it was recently ranked No. 1 in influence by research firm Activist Insight. That firm expects Starboard\u2019s power to keep growing. \u201c2014 has given Starboard the affirmation to be bolder still in years to come,\u201d the report surmises. Perhaps not surprisingly, Smith was dubbed \u201cThe investor CEOs fear most\u201d in a Fortune profile last December.\n\nRelated: 6 Brands \u200bThat May Not Make It Through 2015\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\n\nThe question remains, however, as to whether Starboard is making the right calls for the companies it targets. It is possible (if not likely) that most corporate management teams \u2014 people with significant expertise in that industry \u2014 are better at plotting a long-term growth course than a group of outside shareholders.\n\nStarboard, over time, will have to show that it picks spots where it can make better calls than the entrenched C-suite. Darden, so far, is a pretty compelling proof point. After treading water for years, the stock has climbed from $44 to $61 a share since last July.\n\nThat\u2019s just one stock, though, and it\u2019s too soon to tell for deals inked in the past month. Fortune notes the average activist fund was up only 4 percent vs. 13 percent for the broader market in 2014. This indicates a \u201cgap between activists\u2019 success in getting companies to do what they want and their subsequent investing performance.\u201d\n\nOver time, if that trend continues, activist investors\u2019 ability to sway the C-suite will erode. But for now, the trend of activist investors having more say over corporate decision-making isn\u2019t going away any time soon.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "One hedge fund is behind deals as diverse as the Staples-Office Depot merger and Yahoo\u2019s Alibaba spin-off", "title": "\u2018The Investor CEOs Fear Most\u2019 Is At It Again", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/05/Investor-CEOs-Fear-Most-It-Again", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/11282012_wallstreet_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/05/Investor-CEOs-Fear-Most-It-Again", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/11282012_wallstreet_article.jpg", "creator": "@ameystone", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "One hedge fund is behind deals as diverse as the Staples-Office Depot merger and Yahoo\u2019s Alibaba spin-off", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca9fe\"", "article_summary": "Perhaps not surprisingly, Smith was dubbed \u201cThe investor CEOs fear most\u201d in a Fortune profile last December.\nStaples\u2019 stock (NASDAQ:SPLS) skyrocketed when rumors of the pending merger first broke Tuesday, although it fell back on the actual announcement Wednesday.\nOffice Depot (NASDAQ:ODP) shares jumped about 10 percent on the rumor and have held those gains.\nStaples, for its part, says it began talks to buy Office Depot last September.\nLately, the executives and directors at companies targeted by Starboard are proving quick to act when the fund lays on the pressure."}
