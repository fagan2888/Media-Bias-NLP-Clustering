Ricardo Lara, D-Bell Gardens, speaks at a rally where health care and immigrant rights advocates celebrated the expansion of Medi-Cal to children and teens illegally brought to the United States, held at the Capitol Monday, May 16, 2016, in Sacramento, Calif.\n\nThis week, more than 170,000 undocumented children became eligible to enroll in state-funded health insurance plans in California, going beyond Obamacare to allow more immigrants to have access to comprehensive health services for the first time in the state.\n\nThe \u201cHealth4AllKids\u201d health care expansion allows low-income children under the age of 19 to receive affordable care under Medi-Cal, the name for California\u2019s Medicaid program, regardless of their immigration status. This will allow undocumented kids to access the full scope of Medi-Cal benefits \u2014 such as regular preventive and primary care, dental, and mental health services, as well as behavioral health treatment for children with autism.\n\nThe aim of the expansion is to ensure health care for a population that \u201cfor the most part only had limited access to emergency-only services,\u201d the children\u2019s advocacy group First Focus said in a statement on its website.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s Department of Health Care Services estimates that 114,981 undocumented children were previously eligible only for restricted-scope Medi-Cal benefits, while another 55,019 children couldn\u2019t receive any Medi-Cal benefits at all.\n\nTo qualify for the program, children must belong to a family that meets low-income requirements, making no more than $65,505 for a year for a family of four. Families with lower incomes may be able to receive coverage for free, while other families may pay between $19 per child or $39 for all their children, according to the Desert Sun. About one-sixth of the newly eligible low-income undocumented children live in the agricultural areas of Sacramento and Kern counties.\n\nCalifornia is the fifth state to extend coverage to undocumented children, following Illinois, Massachusetts, New York, Washington, D.C., and Washington state.\n\n\n\n#Health4AllKids: Finishing Job of Getting Kids Covered in Calif. | @mikeyodeh \u2013 First Focus https://t.co/zOHNeBYpEQ pic.twitter.com/BKo26zVzlG \u2014 First Focus (@First_Focus) May 17, 2016\n\nAnywhere between 2.7 million to 3.4 million Californians are uninsured, including 1.4 million undocumented immigrants who may not be able to afford private insurance. Although the Affordable Care Act extended affordable insurance options to millions of Americans, undocumented immigrants were left out of health reform.\n\nHealth4AllKid\u2018s original sponsor, State Sen. Ricardo Lara (D) \u2014 who is himself the son of an undocumented immigrant \u2014 argued that extending coverage to more immigrants would help the government save money in annual emergency room bills. Many uninsured, undocumented individuals do not seek out medical treatment until they have to be rolled into the emergency room, which cannot deny care to anyone regardless of immigration status. In turn, emergency room visits cost the California economy between $18.3 billion and $36.7 billion in lost productivity, according to a 2009 Center for American Progress report.\n\nFor practical reasons, not seeking treatment for illnesses can also lead to significant financial hardship, since uninsured people are more likely to fall into medical bankruptcy than insured individuals, according to a 2007 American Journal of Medicine study.\n\nHealth advocates also argue that the extending health care services to the undocumented population has the potential of saving lives through preventative care, particularly because uninsured individuals are less likely to seek out services for major health conditions and chronic disease, which could have a big impact in their sunset years.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "The emegency room will no longer be the first stop for some of these children.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "The emegency room will no longer be the first stop for some of these children.", "title": "Thousands Of Undocumented Kids Can Now Enroll In Health Care Coverage", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/immigration/2016/05/17/3778852/california-health-care-for-kids/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/17105023/AP_16137830361115-600x315.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The emegency room will no longer be the first stop for some of these children.", "title": "Thousands Of Undocumented Kids Can Now Enroll In Health Care Coverage", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/17105023/AP_16137830361115-321x214.jpg", "creator": "@EstherYuHsiLee", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-immigration", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/17105023/AP_16137830361115-540x303.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/17105023/AP_16137830361115-99x66.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2016-05-17T11:24:48+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/estheryuhsilee"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "California is the fifth state to extend coverage to undocumented children, following Illinois, Massachusetts, New York, Washington, D.C., and Washington state.\nAbout one-sixth of the newly eligible low-income undocumented children live in the agricultural areas of Sacramento and Kern counties.\nAlthough the Affordable Care Act extended affordable insurance options to millions of Americans, undocumented immigrants were left out of health reform.\nCalifornia\u2019s Department of Health Care Services estimates that 114,981 undocumented children were previously eligible only for restricted-scope Medi-Cal benefits, while another 55,019 children couldn\u2019t receive any Medi-Cal benefits at all.\nThis will allow undocumented kids to access the full scope of Medi-Cal benefits \u2014 such as regular preventive and primary care, dental, and mental health services, as well as behavioral health treatment for children with autism."}
