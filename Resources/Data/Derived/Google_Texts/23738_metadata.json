Be joyful and triumphant. Believe that 2016 can be a breakthrough year for you, with fewer aches and pains, more energy and a renewed willingness to take charge of your own well-being.\n\nAs the 12 days of Christmas unfold, here are a dozen reminders that small changes can make a big difference in how you feel, how you look, how you grow and sparkle as a human being.\n\nUse a stand-up desk. You thought I was going to say exercise, right? Later. There are 10,000 studies that show how damaging it is to your health and vital organs to spend long periods of time sitting down. When you rise repeatedly, your kidneys can breathe and your energy can flow.\n\nTrain your brain. Brain scientists aren\u2019t kidding when they tell us to use it or lose it. To keep cognition alive and reduce your risk of all forms of dementia, never stop learning. Take up chess, learn a new language, play bridge. The aging brain thrives on stimulation. P.S. We are all aging.\n\nMake up with someone you\u2019re mad at. Holding on to anger is a drain on your health and happiness. Forgiveness isn\u2019t the same as showing approval. It just frees up space for more joy. Once you\u2019ve given up anger, move right on to diminishing jealousy, hatred and fear.\n\nStop dieting. Gimmicky diets don\u2019t work for the long haul. What you lose, you gain back. What does work is lifestyle change: eating real food, in appropriate amounts and avoiding processed foods.\n\nLearn to cook. Prepare simple, tasty meals that don\u2019t depend on toxic chemicals and exotic additives that extend shelf life but make your life prone to discomfort and disease.\n\nHelp others. It\u2019s my favorite true cliche: Doing good makes you feel better. Teach a kid to read. Volunteer at a food pantry. Get out the vote. Being generous to others is a way of showing gratitude, and there\u2019s big bang for your buck.\n\nStrength train. If you don\u2019t do something to keep your muscles strong and flexible, they will wither and grow stiff and that leads to all sorts of medical misery. Lift weights, do yoga, find the path of moderate resistance and stick with it as long as you live.\n\nMake the mind-body connection. Yoga works for this, too, and so does training in qi gong or tai chi or any of the martial arts. Your mind and your body are intricately connected. Conscious breathing can help you discover the link, and once you do, your vitality will improve in remarkable ways.\n\nReduce sugar. Cutting out sugar is one of the smartest and easiest ways to dramatically improve your health ... in as little as 10 days! Go to the SugarScience website and read all about it.\n\nDetach from technology. If you think sugar is hard to kick, try going without your smartphone for a day. We are addicted to the 24/7 technology, but it is distractive and destructive. How can you reduce your connectivity in 2016? No doubt, there\u2019s an app to help.\n\nQuiet your mind. Your 2016 will be less frantic and more productive if you take as little as 10 minutes a day to sit quietly and meditate. There\u2019s no wrong way to do it. Just show up, close your eyes and when thoughts arise, let them go and return to your breath. The results, over time, are mind-blowing.\n\nExercise! You knew it was coming and here it is. You know why, you know how. What you might not know yet is how much better it\u2019ll make you feel. Just 30 minutes a day, at least five days a week. No matter how many times you\u2019ve tried before, you can always begin again. Start today.\n\n\u2014Marilynn Preston is a fitness expert, personal trainer and speaker on healthy lifestyle issues.
