You can find the disclosure documents here.\n\n\n\nThe firm will assist the Palestinian Authority \u201cin assessing U.S. funding promises to date and help ensure that further commitments of financial assistance are \u2026 received by the Palestinians,\u201d according to the story.\n\n\n\nTruthRevolt.org notes that U.S. aid to the Palestinians \u201cis approximately $500 million annually.\u201d\n\n\n\nSquire Patton Boggs also will help manage the Palestinian Authority/United States diplomatic and political relationship, and it will review the 1994 Paris Protocol that established the economic relationship between the Palestinian Authority and Israel.\n\n\n\nOdwyerPR.com reports that the one-year contract went into effect Nov. 15. It will automatically renew for an additional year unless the Palestinian Authority notifies Squire Patton Boggs of its intent to cancel by Oct. 15, 2015.\n\n\n\nSquire Patton Boggs partner Gassan Baloul in Washington, D.C., writes in the disclosure documents that he \u201cwill be primarily responsible\u201d for the firm\u2019s work. He reports to H.E. Shukry Bishara, minister of finance and planning at the Palestinian Authority.\n\n\n\nBaloul \u201chas significant trial experience, participating in the defense of federal lawsuits involving mass tort claims, complex banking issues, international law and issues involving the Anti-Terrorism Act and the Alien Tort Statute,\u201d according to the firm\u2019s website.\n\n\n\n\n\nNot a fan\n\nAfter this piece from Politico Magazine, it\u2019s fair to say that Matt A. Mayer \u2014 the CEO of Opportunity Ohio and chief operating officer of The Liberty Foundation of America, both free market think tanks \u2014 should not expect a Christmas card from Ohio\u2019s governor.\n\n\n\n\u201cMuch is being made nationally about Ohio Gov. John Kasich\u2019s big win on election night and what it means for 2016, yet much of that premature Beltway pontificating lacks a true understanding of what happened here in Ohio: His \u201cbig win\u201d actually shows a much less popular figure than a first glance would appear,\u201d Mayer writes.\n\n\n\nHe notes Kasich beat an extraordinarily weak Democrat, Ed FitzGerald, and benefited from the general incompetence of the Democratic Party, which once again could not win any statewide elections.\n\n\n\nAnd there\u2019s this:\n\n\n\nThe turnout in Ohio was historically low, with just under 40% of Ohioans casting a vote. Kasich raised over $20 million, with another $4 million in television ads from the Republican Governors Association, compared to FitzGerald\u2019s measly $2.5 million. Kasich\u2019s 2014 vote total only added 26,764 votes to what he got when he barely won in 2010. In contrast, FitzGerald received 825,389 votes less than Kasich\u2019s 2010 opponent, incumbent Democratic Governor Ted Strickland.\n\n\n\nTo put Kasich\u2019s win in Ohio electoral perspective, his \u201chuge\u201d win only provided him with 50,943 more votes than Republican Bob Taft received in his reelection effort in 2002. Kasich\u2019s 2014 vote total was 15,667 less than Republican George Voinovich\u2019s 1990 win and 479,136 fewer votes than Voinovich\u2019s 1994 reelection victory\u2014and this is during a time when the state\u2019s overall population has grown from 10.8 million in 1990 to 11.5 million in 2012. (Even Strickland\u2019s 2006 win snared 512,948 more votes than Kasich did in 2014.)\n\n\n\nMayer makes it clear that he\u2019s no fan of Kasich, noting, \u201cIn four years, Kasich increased state spending by 20%, expanded Medicaid under Obamacare, shifted taxes from income to sales and commercial business taxes, tried to hike taxes on Ohio\u2019s nascent energy renaissance, failed to sustain public sector collective bargaining reform, tripled the number of legal gambling sites from four to eleven, and monitored Ohio\u2019s middling 27th ranked private sector job growth from 2011 to today.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe says the election numbers \u201cpoint to problems Kasich will have in getting past his Obamacare expansion of Medicaid, higher state spending, and tax shifting approach with Republican base voters. Kasich\u2019s minimal improvement over his 2010 vote total indicates an underlying weakness.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nBeyond the sea\n\nThe New York Times runs a letter to the editor from a Case Western Reserve University professor regarding media mogul Barry Diller\u2019s plan for an offshore park off Manhattan\u2019s West Side.\n\n\n\nDiller\u2019s vision plan \u201cmay well be a daring plan, but it is hardly an original one,\u201d writes Ted Steinberg, a history and law professor at Case Western Reserve. He should know; Steinberg is the author of \u201cGotham Unbound: The Ecological History of Greater New York.\u201d\n\n\n\nSteinberg writes that \u201cexpansion at the expense of the sea is one of the defining features of New York\u2019s environmental history. For the better part of the last 300 years, plans have gone forward to build into the surrounding waters, filling in wetlands and open water to produce solid ground and creating more real estate but at the expense of putting more people and property at risk of coastal flooding.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe concludes, \u201cThese schemes to encroach on the sea are premised on the flawed idea of New York as an infinite proposition. They are made all the more problematic by the fact that by the 2050s, sea level around New York will likely have risen by 11 to 24 inches. One can reasonably ask why there should be more building and development in the riskiest coastal areas, especially when the goal is simply an amenity.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nYou also can follow me on Twitter for more news about business and Northeast Ohio.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui", "description": "The law firm will help manage the Palestinian Authority/United States diplomatic and political relationship.
