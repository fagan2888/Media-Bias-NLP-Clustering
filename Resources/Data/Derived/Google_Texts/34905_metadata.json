But Kansas has not made as much progress as other states. Heartland Health Monitor\u2019s Bryan Thompson investigates why\u2014and what can be done about it.\n\nBefore the Affordable Care Act, people of color were much more likely than whites to be uninsured. But an analysis by the non-profit Center for Global Policy Solutions shows that gap has narrowed because of the health reform law\u2014narrowed, but not disappeared.\n\nOcie Corner is one example. The African-American woman lives in Bel Aire, a suburb on the northeast side of Wichita. Corner hasn\u2019t had insurance since 2012. She says she just kept her fingers crossed.\n\n\u201cYou just hope you don\u2019t get sick and have to go someplace, because...you really don\u2019t know where to go. You really don\u2019t,\" she says. \"You just kind of, \u2018Well, it\u2019ll work out. It\u2019ll work out.\u2019 And, you know, sometimes it don\u2019t work out.\u201d\n\nCorner wasn\u2019t aware of the federal insurance marketplace that became available in 2014. But a few weeks before last Christmas, she saw a message on TV about the penalty people have to pay if they don\u2019t have health insurance.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t paying no $600, so it got me to sign up,\" she says.\n\nAnd it\u2019s a good thing she did. Corner went to HealthCore Clinic a couple of weeks later for treatment of a burn that wasn\u2019t healing. They referred her to specialty care, which Corner says she couldn\u2019t afford to pay for on her own. And while her burn was being evaluated, she learned that her blood pressure was too high\u2014and causing retinal damage to her eyes. Her insurance will help her get the care she needs.\n\nBut that peace of mind continues to elude a disproportional share of minority Kansans. A recent analysis by the Kansas Health Institute found that 17.4 percent of black Kansans are uninsured, compared to 7.6 percent of whites. That\u2019s a larger gap than in any other state.\n\nTeresa Lovelady heads HealthCore Clinic, a federally-funded safety net clinic in a predominantly African-American neighborhood in northeast Wichita. She says 88 percent of the clinic's patients live at or below 100 percent of the poverty level, and don't qualify for the insurance marketplace.\n\nBy that, she means they don\u2019t make enough money to qualify for federal subsidies to help cover the cost of their premiums. The intent of the Affordable Care Act was for people below the poverty line to be covered by Medicaid. But Gov. Sam Brownback and legislative leaders have blocked efforts to make more low-income adults eligible for the Kansas version of Medicaid known as KanCare.\n\nLovelady thinks that\u2019s the main reason for the black/white disparity in insurance coverage. And she says the people left without insurance are hard-working Kansans.\n\n\u201cTheir income was too low to meet the federal threshold, but they were too rich to qualify for Medicaid in the state of Kansas. And because we did not expand Medicaid in Kansas, it disproportionately impacted the patients that we serve here at HealthCore,\" she says.\n\nIn Kansas, Medicaid doesn\u2019t cover able-bodied, childless adults no matter how poor they are. Brownback and many Republican legislative leaders say the state shouldn\u2019t extend coverage to them while Kansans with disabilities remain on waiting lists, even though those waiting lists are for disability support services\u2014not medical care.\n\nThe politics of the issue aside, there is mounting evidence that the states that have rejected Medicaid expansion are lagging behind states that have agreed to the expansion when it comes to reducing the uninsured, and narrowing racial and ethnic gaps in coverage.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health", "description": "A recent report credits the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, for helping to reduce the racial and ethnic inequalities in health insurance coverage.
