The exchange was expected to discuss the proposal at its February board meeting.\n\nIf implemented, California would be the first state to set specific rules for paying commissions.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThe concern is payers may steer agents away from more costly customers by cutting commissions at certain times or in certain situations.\n\n\u201cWhen one health plan says during special enrollment, for instance, we won\u2019t pay commissions, they are hoping insurance agents won\u2019t sell them and they will sell sick people into another plan,\u201d Peter Lee, executive director of Covered California, told KHN.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, health plans are barred from denying coverage to people with preexisting medical conditions and allows people who experience certain life-changing events, such as childbirth or loss of employer insurance, to sign up for Obamacare even after open enrollment has closed \u2014 sparking criticism by payers that people could avoid enrolling until they are sick.\n\nSeparately, Covered California released new enrollment data this week showing more heated competition and better prices for consumers.\n\nAs of the Jan. 31 when the current open-enrollment period closed, more than 439,000 new people signed up for Obamacare, the exchange said. Of those, the percentage that chose plans other than Anthem Blue Cross of California, Blue Shield of California, Health Net and Kaiser Permanente nearly tripled from a year ago.\n\nCovered California attributed the results to a good risk mix that forced payers to compete on price and quality.\n\nRecommended Reading\n\nKaiser Health News: California Marketplace May Require Insurers To Pay Agent Commissions", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Meg Bryant", "twitter": {"domain": "Healthcare Dive", "site": "@healthcaredive", "card": "summary"}, "featured": "False", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/cache/fe/58/fe58cdb9fe0f98d2fb2fc5045152a7b8.jpg", "sailthru.tags": "healthcare,type-newspost,healthcare-payer,healthcare-health-law,healthcare-policy-reg", "news_keywords": "Payer,Health Law,Policy & Regulation,Policy & Reg", "category": "News Post", "title": "Why Covered California could become first in the U.S. to set commissions for ACA signups", "pub_date": "feb 19, 2016", "section": "news", "sailthru.date": "2016-02-19T20:10:31", "content_boost": 4, "touched": "True", "article_date_original": "Friday, February 19, 2016, 08:10 PM", "medium": "news", "description": "Healthcare", "sailthru.expire_date": "2026-02-06T20:10:31", "teaser": "<p>The exchange feels&nbsp;such rules are needed to ensure health plans don&rsquo;t use commissions as a way of avoiding sicker, more costly consumers.</p>", "sponsored": "False", "date": "2016-02-19", "sailthru.description": "The exchange feels\u00a0such rules are needed to ensure health plans don\u2019t use commissions as a way of avoiding sicker, more costly consumers.", "viewport": "width=986", "og": {"site_name": "Healthcare Dive", "description": "The exchange feels\u00a0such rules are needed to ensure health plans don\u2019t use commissions as a way of avoiding sicker, more costly consumers.", "title": "Why Covered California could become first in the U.S. to set commissions for ACA signups", "url": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/news/why-covered-california-could-become-first-in-the-us-to-set-commissions-fo/414143/", "image": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/diveimage/california.png", "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "aN-77CvDv8Rt4OQnHMaUSm6V87TF8ri5GDUv93p7pHk", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/cache/ed/b0/edb02a3ec13fc558e3636d0a16ebd5c0.jpg"}, "article_summary": "Dive Brief:Covered California, California\u2019s public health exchange, may make participating plans' pay sales commissions to insurance brokers to ensure that sicker and costlier people aren\u2019t excluded, Kaiser Health News reported.\nOf those, the percentage that chose plans other than Anthem Blue Cross of California, Blue Shield of California, Health Net and Kaiser Permanente nearly tripled from a year ago.\nRecommended ReadingKaiser Health News: California Marketplace May Require Insurers To Pay Agent Commissions\nIf implemented, California would be the first state to set specific rules for paying commissions.\nCovered California attributed the results to a good risk mix that forced payers to compete on price and quality."}
