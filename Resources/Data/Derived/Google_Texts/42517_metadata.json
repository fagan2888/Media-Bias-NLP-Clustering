It\u2019s a continuation of their work from last year, when they were asking the Obama administration if reports were true that U.S. taxpayers are helping diplomats foot the bill for their insurance.\n\nThe legislation found that Obamacare allows subsidies to buy insurance, and lets diplomats of foreign governments use these subsidies, even though they don\u2019t pay taxes in the United States.\n\n\u201cThe Department of State has notified foreign missions in the United States, permanent missions to the United Nations, and the United Nations Secretariat that \u2018the benefits of the United States Affordable Care Act are available\u2019 to their personnel,\u201d the bill stated.\n\nIt also said that while these subsidies are allowed, no one in the federal government seems to have any information on which diplomats are getting these benefits, or how many.\n\nAs a result, the legislation would make these diplomats ineligible for subsidies, and would require the government to certify that no subsidies are being handed out.\n\n\u201cAfter a year-long investigation, the Obama Administration finally came clean about the fact that foreign diplomats are eligible for taxpayer-funded health care subsidies,\u201d Royce said. \u201cThis is unacceptable. Americans\u2019 tax dollars should not be used to foot the bill for foreign diplomats\u2019 health care coverage.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmerican taxpayers should not pick up the tab for foreigners on Obamacare,\u201d Ryan added.\n\nRead their bill here:", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "Two House Republicans introduced legislation on Tuesday that would eliminate all U.S. taxpayer subsidies for foreign diplomats who work in the United States and buy health insurance under Obamacare.
